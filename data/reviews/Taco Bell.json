{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Taco Bell, but this one is the worst one I've ever been to. More often then not when I order something, it comes out wrong. Last week I asked for a Cheesy Gordita Crunch with no spicy ranch, a burrito supreme with no sour cream, the burrito came out right but the Gordita had that awful sauce on it. It took the woman taking my order about 4 minutes to figure out how to put it in, which ok they had a new system so I'll cut them some slack but still. Today I went and ordered a single Double Chalupa, 10 minutes later I went back up and they said \"they're making it now\"...seriously? A one item order and they wait till someone is basically out the door to make it. The best part when I said \"don't worry about making it just give me my money back\" they looked like I just asked them the mathematical formula for calculating the speed of light. I'm happy y'all get $11 bucks an hour now but seriously try to not suck at your job."}
{"text":"One of the best Taco Bells I've been to. I came in around 1230 on a weekday, and it wasn't busy at all. I placed my order and went to wash my hands..by the time I came my food was ready. So you know how you'll take a bite of your food and the contents fall out of the opposite end? Well that's what happened with my beef chalupa (that's a good thing). The food was fresh and they weren't skimpy with the meat or anything lol. Customer service was good as well. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Drive through took 30 min, no exaggeration. It's a Friday at 11:30, but it's still fast food. Gave me the wrong order, which isn't a big deal. Luckily I checked before pulling completely away form the window. They took the bag back and relaxed the incorrect items..it was still wrong lol. Everyone makes mistakes but on top of service being blah and the wait being so long..yeah..not a happy customer."}
{"text":"Juan g was the clerk who took our order. He was very friendly. I never write reviews for fast food but he was so nice and helpful I could not let him go unnoticed. He was very professional and for fast food that can be hard to find. He was kind even when customers where not so kind. So thank you Juan G for being so kind."}
{"text":"I must say that for a fast food location in Gastonia this place stands out as one of the best in my opinion. My food is always hot service is always fast and my drive-thru caretaker is always friendly"}
{"text":"we've been here several times and never had a problem. the drive thru gals are always friendly, out going and professional."}
{"text":"Always long lines, always horrific service at this location. After waiting forever, order is consistently messed up."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times. Always a rough to bad experience. Tonight was the last time I go here. Waited 30 minutes for food. Watched them give the drive-thru order to someone in the lobby. They had to remake that order. People sat in their car for something near 20 minutes. When my food came we were missing a burrito and another one was basically made from the wrapper with a tortilla sitting on top of the mess. 
Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Horrible lady named phelita was arguing with me with what was on the food just bad spot don't eat here"}
{"text":"This specific location had the finest level of service and quality I have had at a Taco Bell in a really long time.  This is nit-picky, but It has probably been 15 years since I have eaten a Burrito Supreme that didn't have all of the sour cream accumulated on one end of the shell.  At this location, they do it right: evenly distributed with equal shares of filling in every bite.  Other items were also prepared with surprising care and quality, plus they gave me just enough sauce at the drive thru, dare I say perfect?  They've done right by me on two occasions, so I suspect it might not be a fluke!  Also, friendly and personable staff."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great service at a Taco Bell. Counter person spent over 5 minutes helping us with the ordering process and was very helpful. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer who comes to this location maybe twice or three times a week for happy hour and lunch. Employees there recognize me and they are always polite and friendly. But recently they hired a new employee, and thereafter received one of the worst customer services I've ever experience. She gave me attitude for her forgetting to unmute her Mic, and proceed to rush my order. I specifically requested no condiments on my order and she placed them on the screen. But there they were, unable to eat what I ordered due to allergic reaction's. I'd forgive any of that due to accident or having a bad day.. but at the drive-through window during payment it took them seven minutes to get my card back. It wasn't even the lady who took my order who gave me my food! She got another person and left halfway through the transaction! 3:15pm, 9/17/2017. I will no longer be coming to this location until there service improves."}
{"text":"Dirty location. I ordered a sweet tea for them to tell me they are out after I paid for my order. And refused to refund me. I don't drink soda."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!  They give you what they want in the drive thru, and hope you won't come back.  I quit going to this Taco Bell a year ago, after they first opened, because the food was horrible!  My gf tells me they have a terrific tostada and I give it one more try.  My order was so screwed up!

I drove back to return the items I never ordered, and get my money back.  The manager was arrogant, uncooperative and hateful.  She wanted to argue with me over $3.  She should be fired!  No communication skills. 

NEVER AGAIN!!  Be aware.  The order may be or not be what you ordered, and if you return the foil wrapped, soggy food, the manager is going to argue with you.  Horrible experience . . . twice!!  Never again.

I live around the corner from this store.  It would be nice to have a fast food to depend upon.  Sadly, it's not this Taco Bell.  These people are idiots and couldn't fill an order correctly if they tried. Arrogant, hateful and  . . . how much sense does it take to fill an order correctly? . . .  a very unpleasant experience that required my driving back, walking into the shop and arguing with the lame manager over a screwed up order.  NEVER AGAIN!  Not this store.  They are idiots.

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The people here in the morning are great. Very friendly and helpful.  The building is really old and the parking lot is very small. Those were my only complaints.  The food was made correctly and hot.  The manager in the morning is very nice. They were actually getting a safety audit during my visit and scored a 98.5.  So the food was safe as well."}
{"text":"Horrible service..I can see staff messing around in the back while I watch them.. waiting for my food.. smh"}
{"text":"From the 9 years of living here, never have they ever screwed up my order. Until recently. I order regular tacos - they give me taco supremes. I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes. I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak. I think the employees need to be less self centered & focus on their customer service."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience this evening. Our drive thru window attendant Abby was very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Last time I was here some asshole in the drive-through called me \"slick Rick\" . So I paid in all change and never went back."}
{"text":"Got all the way home to discover that my Dr Pepper was all plain soda water because the syrup ran out. I called in to tell them and the phone rang 58 times. Then the manager said \"yeah I just changed it...\" no apology, no compensation, just dead air on the other end of the line. .. never again..."}
{"text":"Nice place, very cozy! 
Food was good and came out fast 
Definitely fulfilled that Taco Bell craving"}
{"text":"I fucking pay $5 for a chicken quesadilla and get a cheese quesadilla are you fucking kidding me you guys owe me"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Customers are asking questions and getting ignored so they can chat themselves. Went to sit down ALL tables are dirty. Just went to 5 different dirty tables. Had to clean our own to sit. We are getting to go hopefully not as dirty in kitchen as dining room"}
{"text":"Nothing fast about this place.... 20 mins in drive thru. Food order was wrong and not worth going back. Can drive to the boarder of Mexico faster then these guys serve food."}
{"text":"Nice employees, very quick service. Great for a late night meal. Staff are friendly and sometimes tell jokes while you wait"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Taco Bell and their food, this review is for their employees. This store has the best employees. Doesn't matter what time of the day or late night, the employees are friendly, professional and efficient. The younger kids are respectful and professional too. This Taco Bell hires right."}
{"text":"Okay, technically I didn't eat here. I was in line to order, I saw a couple roaches (I think) scurry across the floor, and I booked it. 
I was in Las Vegas for vacation and was craving something consistent and cheap. Taco Bell is usually a good fix for yummy fast food. This place is off the strip and kinda dirty. What confirmed the lack of cleanliness was two insects hauling ass in this place. Not certain if they were roaches...but they looked like it. They were small, desert sand colored..and had wings (maybe?)."}
{"text":"I used to take my kids here because it was clean.
The guy who was working in kitchen left the kitchen wearing gloves then stood by the register flirting with two girls in loud voice. Touched the register ... sti?l wearing  gloves . Then he went back to kitchen to work wearing same gloves. Which nade me never want to go back there again."}
{"text":"I had forgotten my purse at another Taco Bell, my husband called this one by accident thinking it was the correct one. The shift manager working on 2/10/17 @ 9pm was so helpful, she was willing to go through security footage to help find my purse & was interviewing the employees there. When I called back to tell her he had called the wrong Taco Bell & apologize for bothering her, she was more concerned if I found my purse or not. Just excellent service!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch. The food tasted fine, like normal taco bell food, but the place wasn't very clean. It looks run down and the customer service wasn't that great.

I'm still giving it 3 stars because the food was made like normal, but I will definitely find a different taco bell to go to next time."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes, heard whispering through the intercom, finally gave my order only to wait another 20 minutes for my food, ended up with the wrong order. Never go here!"}
{"text":"Worst taco bell I've ever been in.  Had to wait ten minutes for food.  Trash everywhere, they gave food to me on trays that were soaking wet."}
{"text":"I've been to the drive through four times and every single time I get the grouchy girl at the first window. I can't tell if she had assburger syndrome or if she just hated her job? Anyway, on the fifth time I went through the drive through and was not in a mood to make dinner because of a long day at work. A \"new girl\" is at the first window and \"placing orders\" but she is just as terrible as the girl she replaced. First off, she was she was rude and lacks common courtesy to tell her customers that her headset was not working very well. So instead, I get the sarcastic and condescending attitude and the sighing over the headset with a demanding tone to repeat my order five times. Finally, after 10 mins of trying to place my order I drive around the corner to give her the money at the window, she opens the window and yells at me, \"yo! My headset is like broken so I had to repeat a lot of things, so yeah!\". 
Um, ok?! How am I suppose to know that you wanna be Snooki?! She then demands \"you owe!\" Then slammed the window as I turn to give her my cash from the coffee holder. THAT WAS THE LAST DRAW! I'm so annoyed and sure as hell don't need the petty drama from an immature, too much eye makeup, bobblehead child! I did not have the patience for her ignorance and not to mention I did not want to lose my appetite as she was proudly displaying her disgusting hickies on her neck! Yuck! That's exactly what I need to see before my meal! Effing gross!!! 
So instead, I drove up to the second window and gave my money to the young gentleman, whom politely confirmed my order, and provided me with an apology for the other associate. Even though the guy was nice, I don't think I'll be going back to this location. I just feel bad that has to work with girls like that. Hickies are disgusting! They are not to be proudly displayed. *vomit*"}
{"text":"How does this place not have 5 stars? Come on Buckeye, you can't be that hard to please. This is effing Buckeye.

BUT

Dee Dee is a star manager. 

The ONE time my order was incorrect, I called after I got home and let them know. Dee Dee more than corrected the problem the next day. I wish she was my mom, she seems so nice. This place rocks. 

Vegans, come here for lard-free bean burritos! Woooooo!"}
{"text":"Best place dude I love Taco Bell it rocks the bean burritos are bomb this place is like heaven to me thank u for the great food"}
{"text":"Hands down the cleanest taco bell i've ever been to. I came in to get food with my sister and the service was the best. I was really impressed with one worker in particular. Lorrine G. is great at her job and i appreciated seeing a friendly face in the fast food industry. Definitely coming back tomorrow. and the day after that. and the day after that."}
{"text":"This location at first sight seemed clean and inviting, until I walked up to the register and the girl standing behind it just stood there no greeting. So we ordered cause someone had to be the first to say something. They skimp on meat but pile on everything else, there was a girl that extended her break by about 20 min I know this cause she went on break after taking my order and her co worker yelled across the room at her that she was late and that she was supposed to come back @6:10 it was 6:30. A line of people showed up at which every employee just walked by until.the manager had to be yelled at by his employee. Not to mention this girl touching/ \"cleaning\" with no gloves on!! Safe to say SURE AS HE'LL NOT COMING BACK"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Just such a special experience each time. The employees are courteous and always get my order right, even when i drunkenly yell it at the speaker (don't worry, I'm not the driver) anyways, it is a special treat and it's probably the best Mexican  food you will find in westlake..."}
{"text":"I have been to this Taco Bell couple of times with my family. The staff is very friendly. Lot of veg verity is available for vegetarians."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! Waited 20 minutes in the dining room and never got my order and then was given attitude because I wanted a refund. The guy at the counter refused to give me a receipt showing the amount was returned to the card. Horrible service and the place is filthy, there is food literally covering every surface in this dump. Never again."}
{"text":"this place does not deserve any stars! i never get the correct order' service sucks and i guess there is a world shortage on napkins. came here with 3 other people today and no one got what they ordered. wtf"}
{"text":"The guy working there gave me 2 straws when I ordered 3 drinks, no hot sauce when I asked for it, and only
One spork. They need to
Fix their customer service because it makes them look bad. I shouldn't have to check me bag EVERY TIME I GO THERE."}
{"text":"Jeeeeez this place is garbage....how does it take 20minutes to care of 3 cars in a drive thru....so bad never coming back."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell/KFC is quite possibly the worst fast-food establishment in Glendale. For years I've waited for this place to get their act together, between rude, unhelpful employees who never get an order right (and I do mean NEVER.) to poorly prepared items and everything in between. Half the staff looks as if they are burnt out on pills or heroin which wouldn't surprise me and would explain a whole lot about this place. Last night I decided to try it one more time and see if anything has changed. Well I'm unhappy to report that they did change, they got worse. Not only did they get my order wrong but when we drove back and went inside to bring it to their attention the burnt out soon to be addict looking girl came from the back munching on what I presume to be the nachos they forgot to put in my bag and just replied \"Oh.\" Tossed us our drink and went back and got our missing item. How this hell hole has survived as long as it has is beyond my imagination. Do they use this location to train new employees? Has this location gone rogue? Do they pride themselves on horrible service and a disgusting interior? I'll probably never know, but I just wish this place would close down. Neigh, BURN down, taking whatever malevolent entity that controls this dump with it. 

TL;DR: this place is a god damn joke, avoid it like the plague. I'm even having second thoughts about posting this review because then I'd have to rate it at least 1 star. This place is a definite 0/5. They should pay you to eat there."}
{"text":"Who ever owns Willoughby Taco Bell should see what the issue is with getting orders correct. I understand you're store is busy but damn, can there be some sort of effort is customer service? Forgot some of my food, forgot the drink, no sauce and the food I did get wasn't made correctly and cold. Really?"}
{"text":"I dont usually review fast food chains. But dang taco bell! I waited 15 minutes for two burritos and a salad. How long can that really take? People that came in after me were out the door before me and with more food. 

I honestly wouldn't be upset if I wasn't able to see the two cooks horsing around in the back. I'm out here waiting to get my food and go home but they were too busy throwing tortillas at each other to care. 

Mucho disappointment!"}
{"text":"OK, seems silly to review (another) Taco Bell, but I just wanted to write a little something about how friendly the staff is at this location!  \"Please,\" \"Thank you,\" \"Have a nice day,\" and a smile go a long way!"}
{"text":"This place needs to close.  I ordered a taco salad with chili.  When he gave me the bag I saw no chili.  He said it was in a cup under the top level.  When I got home there was a small cup of pico de gallo not chili.  Additionally the black beans were nothing but paste.  Furthermore, they never answer the phone number provided by google search.  YOU ARE WORTHLESS.  DO US A FAVOR AND CLOSE."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Taco Bells in town.  Open late, so I stop by often when I'm heading home after my shift ends at midnight for a soft taco (fresco style).  Window staff is very friendly and food is always good."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would...employees don't where gloves when handling food...there prices are higher than any Taco Bell commercial or website listing...they have a sign up that says if you don't get a receipt they will give you a $5 credit/gift card, they have very young inexperienced managers and whenever there is a problem they say you have to call the GM. We've been trying for four months and their phone gives you a disconnect single. Go ahead, try and call it! They even told us last night they just fixed it so we tried today. Same old story...bad service, bad quality and dishonest people."}
{"text":"Kinda rude at the drive through . I asked if they can hold on one second and she got rude.  Totally rushed me outa the place"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. This location ALWAYS FORGETS something in my order. Most recently it was a crunch wrap supreme. This is extremely frustrating because we pay for the food and it just becomes money lost. Sometimes I wonder if this intentional thing done to scam customers of money."}
{"text":"I always stop by Here to get tacos. Taste good and fast service. What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's Taco Bell!!!! All Taco Bells are great and this location is not the exception. Fast, always a prompt service, amazing customer service and awesome associates. This is by far my favorite Taco Bell in all of North LV. It's never too crowded and its in a great location- got a Walmart Neighborhood market and a 7 eleven across the street, as well as a post office and an Albertson's in the upcoming corner.!!!!!!!! 10 star review!!!!"}
{"text":"This one is crazy busy every lunch time on weekdays. 12-1:30ish. This also seems to be one of the few remaining ones that hasn't been remodeled in several years. They run better than average on getting your order correct though."}
{"text":"Taco Bell... I favor the #7 and #8. Sometimes with nachos, sometimes with a burrito. However, a #8 with a burrito is like 1375 calories if you choose soda with your included drink. I think it's worth it sometimes... Other times I shudder the thought."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Taco Bell? You can't seriously go there and expect more than exactly what you get. This particular one gets my order right more often than not, so that's good at least."}
{"text":"Friendly service, brand new store, aka clean. What a Taco Bell should be. Also, there's a Long John Silvers attached."}
{"text":"Standard Taco Bell. I used to work by this one a lot. It's always clean and the employees are always nice. I really probably eat far too much of this stuff, but it's so good."}
{"text":"Its Taco Bell, not expecting much! Same 6 ingredients made 15 different ways! but cheap food if your in the need"}
{"text":"Got the 3 free tacos with a large drink but the cashier handed the drink cup with 3 fingers in the cup. She needs training."}
{"text":"For being the fastest of fast food, tb is okay. Decent flavors and options, such as bowls and meatless options. I would rate them above los fav and filibertos taste and quality-wise BUT 9 times out of 10 orders are wrong, missing food or some such issue.
I can't check to see if they got my order right in the car, unwrapping all items, so I usually find out after I get home. Obviously the employees know this and may not care.
Service varies greatly from lunch hour to late night. Employees seem to be friendlier and more engaging during the day. I suppose it is what it is."}
{"text":"Literally couldn't have said it any better Henry. However I think you're rating doesn't exactly portray the level of deliciousness in one meal I mean DAMN. This Taco Bell is the only one I'll ever go to. Top notch customer service. TOP. NOTCH. So the pals wouldn't let us jeep with them. THATS LIFE. I'm rather upset that they wouldn't let us play catch with them. So I actually blame the Taco Bell employees for not coming outside and telling them to involve everyone in their foolery. But they were too busy denying us access into the building. So what it was 12:30am? What are they trying to be, safe or something?! Overrated. 
After it is all said and done...I think I'll
Make this my go-to TBell. 
P.S...
Henry...please do your very best to escape from azkaban tonight."}
{"text":"This is literally the friendliest Taco Bell I've ever been to. The staff is just super nice! The food is always hot and the service is always quick. Management must be doing something right! They're also open until 1 which is great."}
{"text":"The service and speed are nice, but for some reason all of the \"$5 boxes\" advertised on television are $6 at this location, which is misleading. I feel like the store owner is taking advantage"}
{"text":"Their CEO, Greg Creed says \"Easy\" Beats \"Better\".  So it okay to serve crap/garbage as long as Taco Bell serves that crap/garbage Fast! To hell with quality!
 
And this Taco Bell, Taco Bell of Sun Prairie, WI  -  follows that policy to the \"T\"!  Except this Taco Bell is SLOWWWW!  Their food is terrible if you ever get it. Plus, they never get it right. I dare you to order and get exactly what you told them! 

Their \"management\" is a joke, apparently the idiot running the store has never worked at a restaurant before or is too stupid or lazy to do any work. Nobody at store knows what to do. Plus he or she does not know how to interview & train, because these people are just stupid & lazy! You ask a question, and they just look at you with a stupid moronic look! Plus the dining room is always filthy!

The crew with the exception for one cashier in the day-old woman with a limp, are obviously not trained or trained very badly! Wait time in the drive thru runs between 30 to 40 minutes! Sometimes they run out of food, but not screwing around! There is plenty of that! 

Worst Taco Bell EVER! A dubious distinction! But well earned!"}
{"text":"This location is a Taco Bell/Long John Silvers combo restaurant.  It stands out because of the guy that we call \"Happy Guy\".  He works the drive-through and is super friendly.  If you go through the drive-through at night time and he is working, you'll know who I'm talking about.  Another pro on this location - they have never messed up my order (crossing my fingers that I didn't just jinx that.)  The only con about this location is the hours; they close surprisingly early for a fast food restaurant with a drive through."}
{"text":"Again. The last FOUR times I've  been through they haven't had any pizza.  Unacceptable. Take the \"Pizza Hut\" sign down if you don't sell pizza."}
{"text":"This place takes forevveeerrr. There used to be a worked that was really speedy and always made sure the order was correct but I haven't seen her there in a while but when I go to the drive thru it usually takes between 25-40 minutes now. Also the drive thru is closed in so if you get tired of waiting and want to leave you can't because you're closed in. Absolutely sucks plus lately they've been messing up my order. Worker in the drive thru doesn't care about you either she usually forgets at least one thing. All in all absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell at lunch time ever!!! Sometimes having to wait 10-15 minutes for fast food at lunch time when there are only 3 people in front of you....not good for people who only have 30 minutes for a lunch break! They get the orders right 90% of the time and always give free stuff if they have to correct wrong orders. Employees are entertaining to watch...looking confused and arguing with each other. On the plus side food always tastes fresh and warm."}
{"text":"Employees entered 2 of my codes for ps4. And I've had 3 friends have the same thing happen."}
{"text":"Standard Taco Bell food.  Never been inside but the drive through is nice. No consistent customer service compared to others that I've been to. But this one is right down the street from where I live so I frequent it a lot when needing food fast!!"}
{"text":"The second worst Taco Bell I have been in ever. The service is slow and they mess up special orders frequently. The only reason the are the second worse, is that the worse one I was ever in had no self serve soda. At least you can get refills here... And if you show up during lunch rush you'll need one or two refills while you wait for your order."}
{"text":"One of the best Taco Bells Ive eaten at. Food has never been cold or incorrect. Staff is consistently friendly, and it actually is \"fast\" food. I would rather drive to this location 10 minutes away than the two in Ucity right next door to me."}
{"text":"Each time I have went to the drive through they tell me the system is down and they cannot take orders. This is over a two month span of three visits. I'm not sure how this location even stays in business."}
{"text":"The slowest drive thru of all.  I have no idea what takes so long at this location.  Employees also forget to put half of your order in the bag so check it before you pull away. 
I just ordered cheese and chips and a drink. I get home to find only the cheese in the bag. I order three items off the menu and they can't even get it right!"}
{"text":"As a gm of a restaurant in Tempe, the restroom was clean and the overall restaurant was as well. Friendly and quick service. It was pretty busy with their lunch rush but they were working as a team and had a smile. Keep it up ladies and gentlemen.
My only reason for 4 stars is there was no paper towels in restroom and the beverage counter was a little messy. Other than that, probably the best Taco Bell in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Terrible always mess up my order ! The lady or guy named cally is a real snob! She is terribly rude everytime i come here"}
{"text":"Well when they get my order right everything is great. The 2* rating should tel you how often that happens."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell. Waited in the drive thru line for 20 min for them to forget 2 out of 5 items. Never going back."}
{"text":"Honestly this was the worst customer service I've ever had when we first went up the lady was like I'm gonna put you guys on hold and kind of ignored us the whole time and then we finally ordered and she was just rude and like giving us attitude. And like when she gave us our drinks she was like shaking it in front of our faces like with a bunch of attitude."}
{"text":"These guys are just as likely to get your order wrong as they are to get it right ... especially in drive-thru.  Interesting that when the orders are wrong, they are always short and you never end up with anything extra."}
{"text":"I showed up at the drive up window with no answer: first at the speaker and then at the window and I know they were open. I guess they just don't like customers here."}
{"text":"My cashier was Kimberly S. She was so sweet and friendly and the food was made fast, fresh, and wrapped neatly."}
{"text":"Waited 6 minutes at the front counter before someone came from the back to take the order. There was only one person in the dining area and a few cars in the drive thru. The female that arrived at the counter had challenges understanding what exactly the cheesy crunchy gordita was... She insisted it has steak or chicken... Clearly it doesn't looking at the picture.  Ended up ordering something totally different since it was a challenge. Stated the order was for in dining. . Received the food in a bag. And music was way to loud.."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location, the service is crappy to non-existent.  It take forever to get your order (come on! Fast Food!).  Also, often you must stand at the counter for several minutes before you are even so much as noticed by the employees.  I avoid this location at all times."}
{"text":"Most polite and courteous staff of not only any taco bell I've ever, but any fast food joint in general.  

I'm a picky eater I hate sour cream so no matter what somebody's going to mess my order up sometimes. But when these guys made a mistake,  they not only apologized profusely,  they gave me a coupon for a free taco,  have me free cinnamon twists and even offered to throw my garbage away for me. 

I've been to one too many fast food joints that give you an irritated look and shove a new bag with a sandwich in your face with no apology and make you feel like an ass when they mess up your order.  Never had that problem here though,  these guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Abosolutey horrible service  Went to this place and they forgot to give me my food, went back thru to the speaker and explained that she forgot to give me the rest of my food and she says \" walk up to the window right now \".... Who owns this God forsaken establishment"}
{"text":"I have never been in a drive through longer for anything, it was at least 15 min. And when i got home they forgot the meat on BOTH of my taco salads!!! Then they didnt answer they're phone when i called them.."}
{"text":"I just love Taco Bell in general. It is in my top five places to go when I'm really hungry. My biggest issues are that they never ever put anything in their burritos at this particular Taco Bell. There is so little. It's like 1 tsp of chicken and 1 tsp of rice and a drop of sauce. It's 80% tortilla and I'm not exaggerating. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PUT THINGS IN THE BURRITOS!! PLEASE FILL THEM! If you can do that for me I would eat there every other day. 

They do mess up my order on occasion but if I call and let them know they do at least give you a couple of free food items, including the thing they messed up, when you come back. I do appreciate that.

Please start filling up your burritos again!
If you did this review would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat at Taco Bell. As in, never. It's been a good year or more & instead of fighting off the bean burrito no red sauce craving, I took a lovely 30 second drive down the road to the nearest Taco Bell. 

The first thing I noticed in the emptier than empty fast food joint was how filthy it was. Floors a mess, tables needing a thorough wipe down, dried sauce splatter & drippy drink trails everywhere. And it smelled. What was that awful smell?  

Since I've not looked at a menu in ages, everything was new to me. And it all looked really good. The poster of the 2 rolled tacos had me at first glance, how disappointed I was when told \"We don't got those no more.  That's a promotion item.\"  So why is the sign up?  \"It's a promotion that ended.\"  Oh?  When was that?  \"Today. They're changing the sign tomorrow.\"  Um....o-kayyyy

Shortly after placing our order, a mad rush of hungry folks stormed in. They must frequent this place as the filthy state of this place phased them not. Or they were just too hungry to care. 

There was an employee walking about emptying the bins. She was a hot mess, or wreck. Whichever is worse, that is what she was. Of note, when I arrived she was standing right in front of the door smoking. By no means am I an anti-smoker, but you work there!!  Stand aside, go elsewhere, but don't stand right in front of the entrance & drag on your fag. 

Upon leaving, I realized where the awful smell was coming from. The bathrooms."}
{"text":"Thomas N. Was my cashier. He promptly greeted me as I walked in the door with a smile and ensured I received exactly what I ordered promptly and professionally. Thank you"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell looks new, and appears nice, but STAY AWAY!!  This is the slowest drive through I have ever been stuck in.  I pulled into the line 4 cars from the speaker at 6:05 pm, the line doesn't move an inch until 6:08.  I know this is a bad sign, and decide to leave, but unfortunately I have been blocked in by another car.  You cant even decide what you want to order while you wait, the menu board is a full car length in front of the speaker box making it hard to read from the box, and impossible from a car or two back.  I eventually reach the speaker box at 6:21, and immediately place my order, there are 3 cars between me and the pickup window at this time.  Then it gets painful... I do not reach the window until 6:42.  That's 21 Minutes after placing my order.  I have my card ready, pay, and have to wait a further 3 minutes before I am handed my food with an excuse about the slow service.  It took 40 minutes stuck in the drive thru to get food!!  Not exactly fast food."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They made my cheesy gordita crunch wrong, which is the 2nd time this location has done so, and when I went in I politely said \"this has sour cream on it and it's supposed to have the chipotle sauce\" to which the lady replied \"then you come back here and make it yourself since you think you know how to\". This item is the only item I ever get from Taco Bell and it does not come with sour cream. Someone made me a new one and thought it was funny to put sauce packets on the inside of my taco. Horrible."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is by far my favorite fast food. The workers here have never messed up my order and they're so nice! On a few different occasions they have given me a free fountain drink! Helpful tip for Taco Bell: eat it as soon as you get it or it will go soggy and gross. Also, the cheesy gordita crunch is definitely my favorite and when I'm looking for a treat I love the cinnabonz! Lastly, the seasonal baja blasts are seriously the best! I love how they always change the flavors!"}
{"text":"During the day the food is great and staff work hard to get everything right. However, at night there can be some issues with orders and waiting times. Food is great for fast food and we always come back to this Taco Bell. It tastes awesome every time!"}
{"text":"A very clean, very neat and friendly Taco Bell.  I've been here several times and always gotten high quality (for the Bell) food and good, prompt service."}
{"text":"Pleasant service, however, you must nearly always expect a wait if you order from the \"Pizza Hut\" menu... you get a hot, fresh order, but if you're looking for \"fast\" food- stick with the \"Taco Bell\" menu..."}
{"text":"I had the best customer service today by a girl named Taylor. She was so pleasant and cheerful. I went through the drive thru and ordered. When I drove up she handed me my order and said have a great day and please come back and see us. I've been coming here for years and never got acknowledged like that before. She was great."}
{"text":"This location has a bad odor and the bathrooms are dirty...gross!!!"}
{"text":"So RUDE! I got there almost 11 p.m. and they close on Sunday at 11 p.m. I pulled up to the window and the lady looked at me and turned away and then just walked away from the window. I understand if you're closed and not surving food anymore but you could be nice enough to tell me and not ignore me..."}
{"text":"So it says 24/7 and waited out side and drive around for 10 min before I called and said they are closed ?????? Ummmmm wtf?? Yah great service"}
{"text":"Terrible place hair in my food! Terrible customer service never go to this Taco Bell! Hair in my f**king food you got to me joking me!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"ONLY 1/3 the menu is visible at Drive Thru so I had to go in :( AND like $2 for a dixie cup sized soda AND no one offered me sauce."}
{"text":"I came here last night and I had a decent steak burritos and bought a huge craving for my mom. I loved their steak burritos. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Tacos were soggy as if they were sitting there for a while. Returned them and some other food that was wrong and got screwed over with my money. Literally the worst Taco Bell ever."}
{"text":"One of the most inspiring Mexicanesque meal journeys of my lifetime. The \"cheesy gordita crunch\" is an exquisite meal masterpiece. Incorporating the softness of a delicate flatbread, crunchiness of a handmade tortilla shell, and freshness of the \"carne,\" \"lechuga\", and \"queso\" call for two thumbs up and then some. Bravo Taco Bell, bravo. Authenticity has never been truer. Enrich your senses and appease your appetite in an expeditious manner while experiencing a meal of a lifetime. 5 stars. Period."}
{"text":"That carol lady is beyond expectations when it comes to customer service! Every time I go in and see her I know I'm going to have a great time. Food is awesome as always !"}
{"text":"I like getting the meal deal with a bean and cheese burritos chips and a coke. The bathroom is t so clean. But the food is good"}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. This is the worst restaurant in Twinsburg. My order has never been correct, they constantly run out of menu items and the employees are so rude about it all. I would sooner recommend someone visit their dog's arsehole than encourage my worst enemy to make a visit to this the Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Ordered a mexican pizza and the shell had gone so bad it was rancid and left a bad after taste that my soda couldn't wash away. They swapped it out for me with two soft tacos and some free cinnamon twist. I finished the tacos and took a bit of the cinnamon twist and it tasted worse than the shells on the mexican pizza. After I told them that both the pizza shells and cinnamon twist had gone bad, they just looked me with blank faces and continued to use them..."}
{"text":"Shame on you KFC/Taco Bell !!

We buy gift cards to local restaurants for our kids as gifts to use when they are out an about with their friends. Tonight, our 15 year old and several of his friends went to Taco Bell. He presented his Taco Bell gift card and was told that it could not be accepted because our KFC/Taco Bell isn't a Taco Bell and the register won't allow it to be used. Imagine being that 15 year old boy, imagine the embarrassment and discomfort that he felt. He has no money, just this card.

KFC and Taco Bell are owned by the same parent company, and with today's technology, this cannot be a difficult thing to figure out. Therefore, I am left to believe that this is a deliberate attempt to use a narrow loophole to avoid having to accept a gift card as payment expecting that they can then get payment by another means. Not so easy to assume when the customer is a child. Shame on you KFC/Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place can literally not get an order right. Every once in awhile they send in this one manager and things are MAGICAL for the entire time he's there. Once he leaves it goes back to being the same bottom dwellers who GOD FORBID you ask for something extra... Or ask to hold a topping, God only knows what they'll send you off with."}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bells go this one has bever disappointed. The staff provide quick service both inside and drive through. I recently tried the Cantina Power Burrito with chicken. It was a great combination of romaine lettuce, seasoned chicken, tomatoes. I was really surprised at the taste. It felt lighter and set apart from the usual menu combination of cheese meat and iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"This bell is like 5 min from my apartment so I've accumulated some frequent flyer miles for sure. They are consistent and the food hasn't made me sick (cause let's face it sometimes you get that sketch Taco Bell batch). The drive thru tellers are usually pretty on with accuracy too."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! Guy was picking something out of his teeth using the window as a mirror. Other guy asked what sauce and walked away before I could even answer! I will never come back and don't even want to eat my food that I paid for after watching someone pick something out of their teeth!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean but the food doesn't represent anything close to what you want it to be....   My burrito from this place was mostly tortilla.  Really wish I could post a photo of the poor disgrace."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and I have been waiting in the drive through for 15 minutes already. This is not an exaggeration, I have been timing it. I sat at the intercom for 10 minutes, again not an exaggeration, before they took my order. I still haven't gotten my food so I'm thinking based on the two cars ahead of me it will be another ten at least. Worst location ever."}
{"text":"Very clean Place , Great customer service ..and sweet girl with great smile behind the counter named Destiny"}
{"text":"This is truly the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to! I stood at the counter for five minutes before they even noticed I was standing there... Then one lady came behind me, they took my order... I didn't even notice her. 15 minutes later, they had not even started my order... And the three people that had ordered before me, two of them had to bring their food back because they were wrong... These people are ignorant and lazy! I have gone to Taco Bell's since they opened it and this is truly the worst one I've ever been to..."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try. Pulled into the drive-thru at approximately 11:30 PM and there was a line of cars waiting to place orders. Taco Bell.com said that the store was open until 12am. All of the lights were still on including the menu lights.  However nobody would answer the intercom. Finally the cars in front of me pulled ahead through the drive-thru. When I stopped at the window and got somebody's attention that was working inside the store I was told that the hours are messed up and that they have been closing at 11 PM. They had no clue that they had a line of cars clear out to the street. If you are not going to post correct hours please turn the lights off when you close up shop."}
{"text":"This has to be the WORST Taco Bell ever!  First, when my wife and I pulled up at 12:30PM on a Sunday there was only one other customer.  (Strike 1)

I order the Fresco soft taco trio that was advertised on the front window and the manager working the register did not know how to ring it up. (Strike 2)  

When I received the Fresco tacos I had to hunt for the meat and lettuce...it was all STALE taco shell.  I know that window advertisement pictures always embellish, but this was ridiculous.  (Strike 3)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I asked for bean and cheese burritos with no onion, no red sauce with extra cheese (even says it on the receipt). They put double onion, double sauce and no cheese. I would give them less than one star if possible. PepsiCo should revoke this franchise. The wait is always long and the food is subpar compared to other locations. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra 3 miles to 51st and thunderbird and get decent Taco Bell food."}
{"text":"This is the third time now that I've had a greater than 10 min wait for food at this location.  Terribly slow all the time. And was completely out of taco meat one time."}
{"text":"Slow. Awful. unbelievable that this manager allows these kids to goof around,
Ive notified PEPSICO and they are investigating this Franchise location for other types of issues, I waited 20 mins at the drive thru, then when I got up to the window it smelled like marijuana."}
{"text":"So many mistakes. I drove through, I'm so used to errors in my orders, so I checked the order --- it seemed correct so I drove home. I had asked for lots of hot & mild sauce. As it turned out they gave me NO SAUCE. The food taste pretty bland & dry without any sauce. We ended up eating canned soup instead. I made 7 attempts to call to complain --- No answer, got either a busy signal or a fax number sound. Frustrating. We checked the phone number on all of their websites. The number we used was the only one listed. We couldn't eat any of the food & just I was frustrated not being able to at least speak to a manager about it. It is pouring rain, so I'm not about to drive back for packets of sauce to go with the by now cold food. Never again, too many mistakes, they've finally lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"I've unfortunately had to end my business with this location and taco bell itself after almost a year without receiving a refund for an online order that bugged out and wasn't received by the location. I had little to no help from the management at this location and an absolutely unreliable response from customer service."}
{"text":"Went in at 9:20pm, didn't get my order placed until 9:28, didn't get my food until 9:41.  Terrible speed, manager moody, no smiles from employees.  I felt like a burden to them.  All for 2 beefy 5 layers and a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Just getting off of a 12 hour shift and I was dying of thirst ran through the drive thru to grab a drink at 11:30pm Kelsey was working the drive thru .this young woman was very nice and super friendily !! Being a manager In the food industry I must say it is hard to find people that care about guests ! Good job Kelsey !"}
{"text":"Not much to write home about here. It's Taco Bell, you get what you pay for.

The entertainment is better than the food at times. Stumbling in at 3am to see all the drunk ASU freshman is definitely worth the late night drive. 

For some reason, this specific Tbell tastes better than the other ones around my home, so +1 for that. 

Keep doing you and making my toilet bowl gross, Taco Bell."}
{"text":"2 Beefy 5 Layer Burritos with no sour cream. They gave me one with no sour cream and one absolutely stuffed with sour cream. How hard was that order guys?"}
{"text":"This Drive through is the worst.  Normally Taco Bell drive throughs are quick.  Clearly this place has hired the worst of the worst as far as production."}
{"text":"Hot food. Good service. AND the height bar that reads 9' is actually hanging at 9'!  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and the staff was friendly and courteous only thing is that they did forget the nachos I ordered though."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat at Taco Bell but I stopped by because I was in a rush. The customer service and food was amazing! I will be returning in the future for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to this taco bell several times as it is in my neighborhood. Ill have to say that the management and staff are complete morons. Over the last month i have been there probably 4 times and every single time they have forgotten parts of my meal or the sauce. I only order a bean burrito and 1 taco so it is far from rocket science so im a little confused as to wtf is so difficult."}
{"text":"I'm so done with this location. Every time I go here (.4 mi away from my home) I come home disappointed. The kids that work nights here just screw around and don't ever get my order right. Oh well, driving the extra 1.7 miles to go to the one on Power and Mckellips is worth it. Especially when you just wanna enjoy your late night Taco Bell.  Find a different location if you want to eat what you ordered!!!"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for first time in some years. Went thru the drive thru,  Ordered their advertised grilled breakfast burrito and a cup of coffee.  I'm writing this as a warning.  First the burrito was o.k.  but they served the coffee scalding hot.  I like hot coffee, but I could not hold the cup, the heat was intense.  I waited a few minutes to take a sip and burned my upper lip.  I now understand how a restaurant could be sued should the coffee spill on someone.  My guess is someone placed this in the microwave without any idea how long to heat it.  Be careful!"}
{"text":"This location is consistently lightning fast and has the most awesome drive thru staff at lunchtime. My order has been correct on every single visit. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I know this place is busy as heck all the time, but really , stopped in there Friday night and the service was great but the dining room was disgusting as hell.. trash on floor . Every open table top had either trash or sofa that was spilled and not cleaned up. The fountain area was even worst.. Sosa spilled all over. Straw wrappers in the trays soaked. I ended up eating outside which believe it or not was a lot cleaner then the inside"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's yelps fault or Taco Bell, but the hours listed for Saturday night are wrong. Trust me, I had some late night hunger after a show and opted to go go here instead of the University location because of less traffic. THIS LOCATION CLOSES AT 3:00AM, not 3:30. Big difference to the late night snacker."}
{"text":"this is the worst raco bell iv ever been to, rude and confused employees. the burritos are always half the size of what they are at any other locations they have handed me a 3/4th full cup on several occasions. just so many problems with this location"}
{"text":"This place constantly rips you off, from missing items to shorting you on the meat in your tacos, burritos, chalupas, whatever. 

The last chalupas I got from here had the thinnest layer of beef in them and were filled halfway. I'm talking about a pen sized thickness of meat, and only halfway through?! Come on guys. You clearly don't give a s*** at this location as many of the complaints are the exact same thing. Are your employees shorting orders to steal the food at the end of the day or just WHAT is going on here?"}
{"text":"The girls in the drive thru are so friendly, love the service! ! Thank you ladies!!
Everyone has always been nice but there is one white girl that is always nice and makes me happy to  have such friendly drive thru service! ! Sorry don't remember her name"}
{"text":"Probably the worst place you can EVER eat! The food quality is terrible and if your ordering to-go, make sure to check your food before you leave. 80% of the time it is messed up, and if you take it back, they accuse you of ordering wrong instead of apologizing and fixing it. Some of the managers are the nastiest people you will ever meet. Consider yourself warned!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the negative reviews. I have never had an issue with the freshness of my food and the service was always reasonably prompt. 

In addition, I think this store has some of the best employees I have ever encountered in a fast food place in Phoenix. 

The employees are always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I ordered the double dilla which should be extra chicken yet it didn't, instead of the other guy from the line helping make the food he's helping the cashier add hot sauce in a bag"}
{"text":"Was told they were out of empandas for the night, but Brianna found the very last caramel apple empanada. Keep up the good work girl!"}
{"text":"I went to this Taco Bell after the one on 2nd street in elyria has HORRIBLE service. The cashier at this one was a little shy. But she was great! She talked to my 3 year old a little bit too :-) any cashier/waiter that acknowledges the children are a thumbs up in my book :-)"}
{"text":"6461 Boulder Hwy.  Las Vegas, NV 89121 Taco Bell sucks so bad.  Just went through their drive thru and it took 25 minutes.  After being annoyed with the delay I decided to take their survey.  AND I CAN'T.  My receipt doesn't include the survey code, it says it's a reprint.  Probably given out like that to avvoid getting bad surveys due to taking forever on their drive thru time.  This Taco Bell is so awful!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service and friendly employees. My husband and I got lunch today: double decker, stuff nacho wrap and a bean burrito. All were so good."}
{"text":"The drunk college students made me really mournful for the youth.  Is this the future of America?  Hooligans. Some teenaged girl asked me to buy her cigarettes and told me she got a felony for possesion of dope.  Other than that it's a standard taco bell except they are very slow and prone to mistake.  Shame on all of you ASU students.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love authentic Mexican food but sometimes you need the American Mexican cuisine from Taco Bell :) I like the beef better than Del Taco and the supreme tacos are great! Sometimes I wish they would bring back the $.39 tacos, haha, just a suggestion.  This location is pretty fast with the orders and I haven't had a problem with any orders as well, check it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and have stopped here twice for quick meal. Both times I ordered a Mexican pizza and 2 tacos. THe shells seemed stale and the food was just tossed together and it looked like there was anything on the pizza. Nothing like all my other experiences at other taco bells. Not likely to come to see if the 3rd times the charm"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, especially when I just want something quick.  I've been to a lot of different Taco Bells, but this one just became my favorite.  The staff was SO nice, and they made it a point to use each customer's name and to (sincerely) thank them for coming in.  The place was clean and well-stocked.  I was in over lunch and they were very busy, but all the employees had smiles on their faces.  The personal touch was great!"}
{"text":"I went in at around noon on a Saturday.  There were about a dozen people in the restaurant eating.  I was behind two other customers in line.  I placed my order and then waited -- and waited -- and waited.  After 15 minutes, they finally called the number for the guy AFTER me.  Five minutes later I got my food.  Seriously -- 20 minutes of waiting for a taco, rice and nachos.  They have two prep lines, but only one was being used, and on a Saturday at lunch time.  The food was good, but the service and wait time sucked.  When the guy handed me my tray, he did say 'sorry about the wait' -- but he said it like an automaton without any sincerity whatsoever.  This is one Taco Bell I won't be coming back to."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, cheesy roll up tortillas had hard dry edges, cheesy sauce container was not even half full, chip bag was only half full. I would not recommend going there."}
{"text":"Just had the new breakfast.  The breakfast taco was lame. Tasted like something you would make a kid in the microwave. The steak and egg burrito could have been good but they don't use any seasoning.  Very bland even with hot sauce. The hash brown was mediocre, basically the same one u get at Burger King. If u r looking for an alternative to McDonald's try Sonic. They have a pretty good breakfast burrito. 
Swing and a miss Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I had a chicken chimichanga because it was their $5 lunch special. In retrospect, I should have ordered something else that would have challenged the place more. At this point, I feel like I've visited my fair share of -ertos restaurants in Phoenix, and I should have known better to get chicken + tortilla + sauce + sour cream + token cabbage instead of something more complex and interesting. 

There is no reason to go to Nico's when there is a Filiberto's down the street. I might consider going back if I was trapped on the corner of Southern and McClintock, starving, and if I had eaten at that little deli place next to Sunflower Market every day for a year, and I was allergic to Long John Silver's.

It's not that bad, just nothing special. And no salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Repeatedly the worst Taco Bell ever. Slow and rude drive through they don't pay attention when you order so it's always incorrect and they and unapologetically bad. Food is sloppy and meat is extra runny they just don't care at all about quality in any sense of the term. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment and go to the next nearest Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Taco Bell's new breakfast menu is awesome! The AM Crunchwrap is good as advertised. Taco Bell is now my new top choice for fast food breakfast."}
{"text":"Just like every other taco bell, this one too refuses to give you food worth your money and a larger food to tortilla proportion. I eat here and I need hot sauce because the tortilla tastes so bland (and I obviously don't taste the table spoon of meat and rice they give you). I can't stand how taco bells everywhere are giving you no food at all, advertising that their food is something it isn't, and still charging you an exorbitant amount for what you're actually getting. I can get a 3.75 6 inch at subway versus a 3.29 quesarito. The difference? The six inch has flavors, and the bread to food proportions actually allow for you to taste it. Not to mention I'd need 3 quesaritos to fill me the equivalent of a six inch. I sure liked the flavor of taco bell when there was one, now I'm forced to eat subway, Arbys, and I'll even go far out of my way to just eat chipotle over this disappointment of fast food."}
{"text":"Taco Bells everywhere now are saving money by giving you no food. You want a quesarito? Here's 2 tablespoons rice, a squirt of cheese sauce, a few pieces of meat, and a few other dashes of ingredients. Want those new dare devil tacos? Better expect dough flavors that are not spicy. The worst part is, when I would ask for a Grilled Stuff Nacho that looked remotely filled, like the picture and commercial advertise, I got charged for over the price of two Grilled Stuff Nachos, because they had to add extra ingredients (and it still was no where near filled). This is such a disappointment, I chose Taco Bell over burger fast food joints and subway because their food was better. Now I'm done going here."}
{"text":"I had the burrito w/Fritos inside.  I'd rather have my Fritos in a bag.  Now they have Doritos taco shell on the outside w/taco bell stuffings inside. What! Doritos locos tacos! I love Doritos! I'll come back to this place to try it. This shop is clean. Good customer service."}
{"text":"I've come to this Taco Bell a lot, multiple times a week most of the time, and I've never had such a terrible experience. They took an unusually long amount of time to get us our food in the drive through, and when we got our food we had barely any sauce even though we had four people. When we asked for more sauce she literally gave us ONE more packet of sauce. Even her co-worker questioned what she did, as it was terrible customer service, saying \"That's it?!,\" and she replied \"If they want more they can get it.\" Seeing as the other employee seemed nice, we didn't want to be rude so we pulled around and I went inside and grabbed more sauce. But it doesn't end there, once we got home we realized that we we're missing a burrito that we had PAYED for. We called the restaurant to make a complaint and the supposed manager picked up and it was the same lady who gave us one packet of sauce at the drive through, \"Dory,\" if that's even her real name. She wouldn't tell us who her higher up was, probably because she knows what she did wrong, and when we asked for her last name she wouldn't tell us that either, \"just Dory,\" she said. We asked who her district manager was and she was hesitant but gave us the name Mark, just Mark. No last name again, so now we asked for his last name and really hesitantly this time, as if thinking, said District. Mark District... I'm not sure if that's a real name or not, she gave me plenty of reason to believe it isn't, but I plan on finding out. After that we had had enough and simply hung up. Haven't had such a poor experience before."}
{"text":"Seriously man... I don't even know why I even bother coming to this t bell. They are always messing up order. When I order cinnabon delights I expect more than 2 or when I order a side of cheese and spend an extra dollar on freakin nacho cheese I expect my freakin nacho cheese!!!!! Over this t bell. Watch you're employees because a billion dollars will be missing."}
{"text":"I buy my lunch here every week. Food is always good and fresh. Good customer service.
The only thing I don't like its kind of hard to read the menu on drive thru and there is no cover from rain"}
{"text":"I need the cheesy, bean, and rice burrito back! This location sold it for the longest after they officially took it off their menu and I ask for it every time I go back with no luck."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is literally amazing. Whenever I drink, I love to eat Taco Bell. Five out of five stars all day every day"}
{"text":"They always get the order wrong!! Even simple order. They should call it \"taco's gone wrong\" They food is not good at all. I don't know how places like this stay in business. 1:30a"}
{"text":"I agree with Raymond! They just don't get the order right. I think they do it because they don't care. They know u are not coming back once u pull off. I don't know how they stay in business or employee. The food is so bad and cold.."}
{"text":"This location is right next to my place of work. We normally don't eat here however when we do, the staff is consistently friendly. Friendly enough that it warranted me to write a review. Thanks for the great service Taco Bell on Country Club!"}
{"text":"So disgusting, soggy tacos. Wet lettuce. Please if your gonna build tacos for a living take some pride."}
{"text":"I frequent this store at least 2 to 3 times a week. However I recently went during the day because I was working from home. My order was incorrect and food was missing. When speaking to the employee and manager they were both beyond rude. The customer treatment at this store is deplorable to say the least. And if you tell them your reporting the incident they don't care and act like they're untouchable. I have never in my life received such horrendous customer service!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could give NO stars because the previous posters are right; this place is TERRIBLE. They are always out of something, often it is chicken! A 20 minute wait is the norm, be it the drive-thru or inside. You might as well go inside if you insist on eating here, as your order will most likely be wrong. I have been told they are out of verde sauce and that they will no longer be carring it (not true), I have been given 2 chicken strips instead of a breaded chicken sandwich (often) and even if I order one thing, 50/50 chance it will be wrong.
 I have called to complain to the GM but never recieved a call back. Today the GM, Farrah, was there. I told her the issues I have and she said, \"We'll work on it.\" and blew me off. It was rude and dismissive.
 I only go to this location because it is literally across the street from my house, and my son begs for Taco Bell as a special treat. No more.
 The location at 43rd & pinnicle Peak and the one at 57th & Bell aren't as bad, and the Taco bell/ Long John Silver is almost always right. However, I won't go anymore. I can get junk food anywhere, made right and with a smile; why would I give my money to them?"}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait at the drive through. (Only 1 car ahead of us) Food wasn't even hot or fresh. I would rather grab food else where next time."}
{"text":"The people here always half a*s listen to what you are ordering and always screw your order up. If I wasn't craving nachos right now, I wouldn't have even bothered!"}
{"text":"Best employees out if any fast food restaurant, always leave happy. They're not afraid to give lots of fire"}
{"text":"I usually come here at night, but lately the night crew have been messing my order up. One night my good was cold by the time I got it after waiting in such a line. When I went to get my replacement order the Guy manager the fat one that works the night shift gave me a hard time and a few days later I returned and he gave me a dirty look and once again my order was crap. They're getting to cheap on putting the food inside my loaded grillers. And to.top it off he forgot my sauce. If your going to ask when im in the drive-thru what kind of sauce I want then give me it when i answer. I come from fast food which gave me great respect for people who work there, Now working HIGH END retail I still expect Great Customer Service. This Taco I will NOT be returning to."}
{"text":"Wow the customer service at this taco bell is so nice. We have encountered a girl on two separate occasions  \"Mia\" that is friendly. She really takes pride in her job and has a great attitude. I just wanted to point that out because sometimes when you go to fast food later at night workers are usually not exactly happy like and let little things affect them. It is just refreshing to see an individual in this enviorment working so well. The food all was great and very professional looking, with nothing forgotten. Thank you."}
{"text":"I do not eat here a lot, but when I am hungry and do not feel like spending a lot of money, this is the place to go.  There fiesta potatoes are the best!!!  When I do eat here, I have to work twice as hard at the gym."}
{"text":"It is little clean, there is some dirty tables, staff is friendly, and helpful. The menu seems old, the decor has inspirational quotes. The order is slow, we had to wait awhile, the tacos were not great, the grilled ghost pepper burrito was pretty good, was not particularly spicy. Quesoburrito was pretty good and worth the money."}
{"text":"This location is very slow, always have to double check my order.  Customer service really stinks.
Drive thru only has one working window.   Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service anytime I ordered food here. I never ate inside so cannot say much but the staff at the window have always been friendly. Never had a problem with the food - they prepare it well. Just a few times they couldn't get my cheese quesadilla order right always handed me a chicken quesadilla for whatever reason. I always make sure it is what i ordered before leaving now. However, the dollar menu is very fulfilling and even anything that's little over a dollar makes you full. Definitely a great fast food for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru today. A very nice young lady took my order. She was very pleasant and polite. Of all of the taco bells that I go to, this by far is my favorite. I hope they keep hiring quality people as Rylee. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Normally a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell. However this is not the case here as the people always go way beyond what you would expect. The restaurant is always super clean. The people working there are always very polite, friendly, and have a respectable appearance. The food is also always great; I've never had a bad meal there.

Basically the  employees take pride in their work there and it shows."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We're from New Zealand and had no idea what we were doing. First time in the states, first time at Taco Bell. The young guy at the counter (wish I knew his name) was really friendly and made good conversation. Also helped out with orders. He was really awesome. Had dark hair and tan skin - wish we had more details so we could give him a shout out but he was lovely!

The tacos were really good and we got our food in a timely fashion. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place took 1/2 an hour just to take my order....only 3 cars in front of me. Taco Bell, not a fancy order, just tacos from Taco Bell. 

When I pulled up they didn't greet, so I said hello and got a attitude with her response. \"I'll be with you in a moment.\"

That moment took another 5 minutes before she came back on the speaker...pretty dumb. This sort of thing happens all the time at this location. 

Last time I go here...."}
{"text":"Do I have to give this one star in order to write a review?
They \"control\" drive thru time by delaying taking your order. 
Drive thru orders incorrect 50% of the time. 
No straw, no napkins, don't ask what sauce you want.  Skimpy on the meat, tacos already split open. 
Prices 50 cents or more over TV commercials because this is not a franchise. It's privately owned.  
I drive thru due to mobility problems.  They don't honor Taco Bell senior citizen offers or free drink, or Diamondbacks offers. 
Never going back."}
{"text":"I was charged for items i didn't order and didn't get all the items i did pay for/order. They asked do I want napkins and sauce- I said yes and mild BUT then they gave me neither...so paid for stuff I didn't order, didn't get what I did pay for and didn't even get napkins or sauce after being asked and saying yes- yea fuck this place"}
{"text":"My family went here every week for almost two years (Taco Tuesday) and had good service and consistent food. We had very few wrong orders and in fact the only wrong orders I can think of involved us getting extra food. :) The drive thru staff were always polite and engaged you in conversation. We stopped going here recently due to them no longer taking mobile orders."}
{"text":"I love how this location is open late and I always get the best service! Even though it is late Chris still gives the best service! Thank you jones location you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I know it is a fast food place and should not expect much but service was terrible, super slow and unfriendly staff"}
{"text":"We waited for half an hour, then we found out the order wasn't entirely right. But other then that it was great."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely disgusting and made so poorly. the cheesy potatoes were hard and cold and both of my Taco shells were broken in like 4 different places I couldn't even pick them up without breaking... very disappointed because I visit regularly and was just not impressed after this experience, will go to another Taco Bell from now on."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful at the drive through. Just a disgrace. These employees have no pride in what they do. And it shows!"}
{"text":"The food is Taco Bell.  Good and cheap.  The cleanliness is usually adequate and I see them emptying trash fairly frequently.  The problem is, though, they are consistently slow.  I don't know if it is that they are always understaffed or the employees need additional training or what, but a simple order of two boxes took almost 30 minutes.  Every time we come here they are slow, and they never offer compensation like you'd expect from a more competently run establishment. 

West View had a Taco Bell years ago that failed.  I fear with their poor service, this is going to have the same fate."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on 10/16/14 and the man taking my order sang a little song to me good voice friendly service!"}
{"text":"This was rebuilt after a fire destroyed the old taco bell. Nice new look, clean and good service. Why only three stars? \"A lot of mild sauce\" means two packets and \"a bunch of mild sauce\" means three packets. Why so stingy? 
At the drive-thru my friend ordered a fresco soft taco supreme. She didn't know \"fresco\" meant no toppings...and the drive-thru announcer chuckled."}
{"text":"Fabulous. This day most fast food places have horrible service. Most of the time I think that fast food workers are crazy if they think they deserve $15 an hour because they play around with the staff putting personal conversations ahead of customers. Half of the time when I ask what ingredients are on particular menu items they look at like I just asked them to slap their mom. This place proved me wrong. Fast friendly service. Happy, knowledgeable staff and they are not skimpy on the ingredients. *side note* although I try to avoid fast food as much as possible every time I have visited this Taco Bell my order has never been wrong!"}
{"text":"I had a great visit. Met the store manager Kevin. He seemed personable and treated me well. The Nacho Bell Grande is my favorite"}
{"text":"Super mad that I came here at 12:45 am, when they're supposed to be open until 1am. When we drove past the first window the lights were on, and once we got to the second window the lights all of a sudden turned off. Pretty pissed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this taco bell! The staff is so nice! And the food is obviously delicious.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I feel like the place can be a little cleaner otherwise it's the best!  Love the hours too.  You can always count on taco bell being open."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell manages to mess up my orders every time I go there without fail. I tell myself \"maybe this time they'll get it right\". Sadly that's not the case. Not only this, but they employees hardly speak English and the food has obviously been left out for an extended period of time. Not even warm. It's 11:06 right now so whatever you managers need to do to correct the employees for this shift , please do. Check out your reviews. Might be time to re structure before the place is shut down."}
{"text":"Wow! 
Absolutely the worst taco bell food I've ever had.

The employees were nice.. but that's all I can really say that's positive about this location.

My order was taken correctly, but when I got home half of it was missing.

When my daughter and I actually bit into the tacos, it was like eating slimy dust.  I immediately spit it back out.
She did the same..

Ultimately, it ended up in the rubish bin. 
A complete waste of time and money.
We won't be going back.."}
{"text":"Don't eat breakfast here unless you like dining with homeless people and their dogs and bags.  The taco bell employees wont stop dogs in the restaurant or even question homeless people living there.   Go somewhere else if you have to get your bell on."}
{"text":"Twice I have been here and twice I didn't get hot sauce or napkins with my order. These businesses already make incredible markups on the trash they serve and I can't get nappkins and hot sauce....that is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I just have one thing to say about this place.  Is there some reason no one can wipe off a table here???  I swear everytime I come in this place there is not a clean table in the house and the floor is covered with garbage.  It is a brand new building!   There is no reason it should like this!"}
{"text":"Have been here only once recently, during the middle of the day. Had one of the nicest cashiers. The food is what you would expect."}
{"text":"First of all every single time I go to this Taco Bell they take forever. One time I even got stuck in the drive-through line for about 30 minutes and couldn't leave.


Tonight I had the worst customer service ever. I believe her name is Marlena? She was so unbelievably rude because I asked for large water along with our drinks and food. She said they only had smaller cups for water and I said that's totally fine may I have 2?
She rolled her eyes and gave me 2 waters. 

We had bought enough food to feed four people and she gave us three mild sauce and when I asked for more she was rude again and then mocked me. Then when she gave me more sauce, said \"bye\" and slammed the window shut... When I got home I realized that she put onions in my burrito (which I'm allergic to and specifically asked for no onions) (even says it on the receipt) , gave us all hard tacos when we asked for soft, and forgot one of our tacos. 

I get its been a long night for some people... But sometimes it's been a long night for the customer too. Customer service is everything...be happy you have a job bc I'm sure plenty of people could use that job."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location I've always treated with a friendly staff member! I usually go through the drive thru but they are young but very respectable. I'm glad that my neighbor hood Taco Bell is this location because my girls and I come here often."}
{"text":"Lucky to get one fucking star. 35 minutes in the drive thru for them to give me nothing close to my order. Especially when my order has to be specific due to allergies and health reasons. Fuck you Taco Bell. Close this location."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell EVER! Waited approx 8 minutes for my food with only 1 car ahead of me in line. Then they forgot some of my food! Not that hard people."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Taco Bell I've been to. From the food to the management. I've only been during the night, and every time I've been disappointed."}
{"text":"I like the beef burritos from Taco Bell, but this perticular restaurant turned me against them , maybe for good. The filling is very soupy, making them hard, if not impossible to eat. Tried them a couple of times, same thing. I live in the area and would love to see a GOOD Taco Bell here in Tuscola, this one isn't it. The other complaint i would like to comment on is the lettuce, which has a very strong chemical taste, like it hadn't been rinsed off. Too bad, I have talked to people in the Tuscola area who says they wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Have only been there one time, after the bar!! There was no line, staff was very friendly, our order was correct and yummy! I love TacoBell but some locations arent as good as others. This one im very happy with. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Each visit a disappointment. They're very stingy with the amount of meat in your order and load it up with veggies. Nacho chips tasted stale and they're stingy with the nacho cheese. You'll end up with just chips before halfway to finish. Ordered chalupas recently... They must've reheated the crust. It didn't look or taste fresh. Again, lack of meat. I threw it away. Ordered a chicken quesadilla and got a lack of cheese quesadilla with 5 scattered chicken pieces. That would be my last trip here.

Take the extra minute to visit the other location off skypointe. They always give the proper amount of toppings."}
{"text":"Drive thru wait time can be a bit of a pain but it's better than going to the other Taco Bell in town. 

I always get the amount of fire sauce I request."}
{"text":"Decided to do a late-night run to Taco Bell, the line was long but we thought 'what the heck'. When we got up to the speaker box, the cashier was laughing about a joke his coworker had just told him or something. He asks us to hold on, comes back to us to take our order 5 minutes later, we order two double decker taco's (add nacho cheese plus $1), a tropical freeeze, and last minute..the 4 piece Cinnabon treats. After scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed 17 times we get up to the window. We see a lady at the counter, I assumed her shift was ending because she had her purse on the counter where they take customer's orders and she was holding a banana...between her armpit. The guy came to take our money and hands us our food. We drive away, ready to feast! We get back to our place, I unwrap the cheesy goodne-oh what the hell! NO NACHO CHEESE....okkk....we eat them anyway. I pop one of the Cinabons into my mouth, bite down on the swee-oh god! Tasted like i was biting into a handful of sand. I take another bite-not sure why, but curious to give them a second chance. NOPE. Nope. nope. Now I've been sick for a few days *sniffle* so my tastebuds have been acting up. Food is tasteless for most bites, color has become colorless, and touch..well touching is cool. ANYway, this BITE felt like cum. I'm pretty sure it was."}
{"text":"I don't review many fast food places but this place is the worst. Dirty bathrooms and dining area. They were horribly slow and the cashier had many customers waiting to order while he was in the back."}
{"text":"This review is based on the 4 times I've been here for lunch. Always quick service and I've gotta say wonderful drive thru customers service. They are always super friendly and nice! Some other reviewer mentioned the restroom, but I haven't  been inside to comment. As far as fast food goes, this taco bell is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've stopped here for lunch after church and have had to wait over 20 mins for my food. After waiting 20 mins and finishing my lunch my sister still without lunch ask were their food is and they say they lost her order. Needles to say we will never come back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Started off in the drive through. Ordered 2 shredded chicken mini quesadillas and 2 chips with cheese. Received 2 shredded chicken and 2 beef mini quesadillas. Usually we wouldn't have bothered and would've went straight home. My partner insisted  so we went in and asked for what we ordered. They were polite and refunded the overcharged amount and fixed the order. Got home. Took ONE bite to find a long black HAIR inside the quesadilla. Pulled it out. Opened it up and found a SECOND black hair in the food. 
 I have blonde hair and my partner has red hair. Needless to say... No longer going to this location. Professional staff but poor quality of food."}
{"text":"The staff under James fenning is one of the worst things to happen to America I might actually would rather eat dog sh*t than sit In  line and be talked to by the shift Managers who I think his name was Dan Schneider at the time. Left before even receiving food."}
{"text":"Worst slow service ever.  Over 25 mins in drive through on slow night.  Clearly not staffed well or managed well"}
{"text":"After coming here 2-3 times a week for about 7 years - I think i have the lay of the land...

I get food fast, food is good enough, always cheap, never had a problem, very well managed.

I could eat bean burritos pretty much every day - and some weeks, I do."}
{"text":"Very impressed by this Taco Bell. Their service is right behind Chick-fil-a. Workers are very friendly, smile, etc. Food is made fast. There was a mistake with my order one time, they fixed it, and gave me free cinnamon twists! Sweet."}
{"text":"I live in Southern Highlands and I love taco bell but lately I have been getting food that is cold. I always go through the drive thru and a couple weeks ago I ordered a taco salad with ice all on the bottom I took it back and they did give me a new one but yesterday I ordered the big box and the tacos were Cold I called no answer couldn't drive back I had to go to work, so I drove back today told the manager and all she said was thank u for telling me and gave me a 99 cent free taco coupon. Never even replaced it I'm getting sick of the cold food and not replacing it so I'm not going to go as much any more because the service is terrible. They don't care because they have already got there money. Bad service at this TACO BELL"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is right near my house so I happen to go there every once in a while, and each time I am disappointed. This last time, I asked for a burrito, and even after confirming the order and correcting them I was given the burrito BOWL. I noticed this when I got home and I was a little upset but it wasn't a huge deal, but when I opened the bowl, there was hardly anything in there! I didn't use to have any issues here but as of recently I am disappointed eventually time I come in. I love Taco Bell, but probably will go to one a little further away next time."}
{"text":"The Sunday shift wasn't calling out orders and when food was sent to the wrong table they didn't remake the order. I had to go back to the register 3 times because they kept messing up my order. They just don't listen to their customers or care."}
{"text":"I just went to Taco Bell and when I ordered my tacos, I was informed of their new policy to not serve a cup of water.  I could buy a bottle of water or pay for a soda, but they will no longer provide a free cup for water, even with a paid meal.  Taco Bell, you have lost me and my co-workers as customers.  Goodbye."}
{"text":"I stop at this location about twice a month and always use drive thru. They always get my order correct and they are always nice and friendly. Had a couple breakfast items today and they were great!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly, place is always clean, and service is great. Plus its open til around 2am usually so its an excellent place to grab food with your friends!"}
{"text":"Love their drive thru crew! Super nice and quick."}
{"text":"New location, same staff.  Most of the staff speaks broken English and can't take an order to save their lives.  Don't ask for a custom order because they rarely get it right the first time. If they got an all new staff it might be worth it to eat inside but until then drive thru works just fine."}
{"text":"Best taco bell in town go here often the manager Margret is always nice and remembers my name. If there is ever a problem they are quick to fix it cant ask for more."}
{"text":"I just left this location about 15 minutes ago. Their closing time is midnight and I waited in the drive thru and said \"hello\" because no one was greeting me. There was nothing but silence for minutes. I ended up leaving and while driving off noticed a worker not doing anything of any importance whatsoever.  Their open sign was not turned off. 
I was not the only person in the drive thru. My friend ended up leaving also."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. They rarely have someone working the drive thru that can get your order right on the first or second try, but today was over the top. After politely correcting her multiple times (I'll leave her name out of this review), I get to the window and she snatches my $ out of my hand without a word, slams the window in my face multiple times and then hands me my food with mild sauce in the bag (purposely because I asked for fire). Wow. It's just annoying to be treated like a nuisance from a 16 year old, probably working their first job. Don't worry, we'll drive out of the way to other locations from now on."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best Taco Bell I've been too in my life! The cashier was a sweetheart with a great sense of humor and my large order was prepared fast and hot with a kitchen of exuberance. That must be one dolphin flippin fantastic manger to have such a sublime crew! :D"}
{"text":"Two things. Some serious stomach gut pain right after eating their 5 dollar cravings deal and why the heck is the dine in closed randomly all of the sudden. I ordered a 5 dollar cravings deal months ago (stopped going there) at around 5 to 7 pm on Saturday. After a couple of hours, the inside of my stomach felt like it tearing a little. This pain lasted for 2 whole weeks and I was not happy or satisfied with this experience at all. Also, their survey is a scam. I did a total of 100 surveys out of all my visits and never won. I think they only give the 500 dollars to people who work there, friends, or relatives. Or people who spend hundreds regularly.

 Recently like weeks ago, they kept the dine in closed for no reason. I went back 2 different days and both days were closed. They only serve drive thru. Not sure if the dine in is still closed."}
{"text":"Night staff is very friendly, food is good if you want something fast and cheap, if they get your order wrong they'll make you a new one for free if you come back, but most of the time they get it right."}
{"text":"Lydia W was very patient and took care of everything professionally and the food was great"}
{"text":"Horrible place, they charge for everything such a sauces.. Not enough chicken on the quesadilla. DO NOT GO THERE!!!! It's a rip off"}
{"text":"Good god I'm getting tired of this shit. Nasty ass workers. Got my order wrong. Tell them to get back on the short bus and go home."}
{"text":"Bomb food, but I came here man and all I wanted was food. They were closed as hell. 1 hour before time. Couldn't believe it. Still can't."}
{"text":"Worth the wait.although a long line the food was  excellent. This taco bell is always busy the food portion was really good tacos filled to the top. The nachos had plenty of toppings. Everything was fresh and hot. A good place to eat.employees very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be reviewing a Taco Bell. I've been to this location several times, and I've never had a bad experience, so it already has a good mark in my book.

I drove through a little after 10 tonight on my way home. It was mentally a long day and I was tired; I probably looked like a weirdo or doped up or something (I'm not).

I noticed while waiting for my food after paying that the girls seemed to be having fun; I could just hear some laughter but I wasn't really paying attention. I always love it when people enjoy working together and make it fun. The girl who took my payment and served me was friendly and pleasant.

I probably would have left it at that and just had a pleasant enough drive-through experience that was nice but not necessarily Yelp-worthy, until I got home. Not only was my food well-presented (which, whatever--it's a Cantina Bowl, so I wouldn't really have been upset if it was less than pretty), but \"have a wonderful evening!\" was written on the top of the plastic container in oil marker. I don't know if they wrote a bunch of them out for whomever came through tonight, or if it was just for me because they thought I was strung out or something, but it doesn't matter. It was a sweet gesture and it made me smile. That little tiny extra effort is a big deal in customer service, as far as I'm concerned. Kudos to the team tonight."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow. Did I mention slow? One car in front of me, I've been waiting ten minutes. And of course I can't pull away, because they block you in."}
{"text":"Plain and simple this restaurant is the worst I have ever been in the help could care less about anybody.  I have sent emails to taco bell after our visit and never recived a response.  EVERY BODY STAY AWAY.  !!!!!!
 The only reason I put a star is because it made me.."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell in the GTA.
- best place for Mexican in Ajax.  Hitter' up!
- staff were patient with me as I was ordering a lot.  my entire order which was around $35.00 worth was exactly what I asked for, no mistakes!  no other Taco Bell can pull off such a feat.  Good job!"}
{"text":"major disappointment. burrito the size of a rolled taco. tostada with about a tablespoon of beans on half the tostada."}
{"text":"I ordered a $28 KFC bucket from this KFC/Taco Bell. I was ignored for 15 minutes while I stood at the counter. After 15 minutes I was told that they do not have the Extra Crispy chicken that I ordered. I asked for my money back and the cashier was very hesitant and insisted that I could have original or grilled instead. When the manager came over she was very prompt and polite in giving my money back. The cashier name on the receipt was 'Newbie'. I will never visit this store again."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell in the west valley. Service is consistently fast and friendly. Food is good. Good job!"}
{"text":"Not all Taco Bells are the same. I don't know what has changed in the last year or so, but this location is soooo sloooow. Several times I have had to wait 15 minutes in the drive thru after placing my order when there were two cars ahead of me. Today, I ordered a mexican pizza and a potato soft taco and they were both tasting of stale oil. Potatos were dry too. I give up on this location."}
{"text":"Brianna is the fixer of problems, suggester of foods, and all around nice person."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood TB. I usually come here when I am lazy & want a chicken soft taco or quesadilla or those awesome Doritos Locos tacos, to fulfill my junk/fast food cravings.

On this particular visit, I decided to stop in & try the new Cool Ranch Doritos taco. IMO, I prefer the nacho cheese version. But, at least I can say I tried it.

The service here was very good & they made my order very fast & were polite & friendly; which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"What can I say, its Taco Bell. Its fast & its cheap. Friendly staff, great preperation & product & super close to the Casa ;) Get some!"}
{"text":"I give the night crew 1 star the day crew very good!!!!! they messed my order up forgot a quesadilla put that nasty sauce in it that I asked not to my bean and cheese burrito I didn't even recognize it it looks like a freaking kid rolled it.. it wasn't even long it was all short like little mini burrito my tostadas little bit of cheese.. the lady in the front could care less about her job how she was looking... Morning crew has never got my order wrong that's why I come to this location I will never come back in the night"}
{"text":"This TB is in need of a serious remodel or just demolish & rebuild.  Food & staff are fine; the facility is horrible and very HOT in the late afternoon Phoenix sun."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant which also houses KFC and I think they have issues with that in regards to speed of service. The lady at the drive thru smiled and thanked me for coming and asked if I wanted sauces.. I asked if that cost extra and she said yes. I declined.. Also if you have an issue with food they are very strict on refunds per sign on window so be cognizant of that"}
{"text":"I never get what I order. Rude employees and terrible service. Never coming back. I'm not sure what happened here. This used to be a great location"}
{"text":"Came here for my lunch break. The cashier Q was really friendly. Made me feel welcome and at home. Good customer service buddy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for several years. I get picky about my order. No creamy anything! And I pretty much never have to worry about them getting it right. Which is unheard of if you frequent the border often. I have complicated orders and I feel confident every time I go to this one. The workers obviously take pride in getting orders correct. THank You!"}
{"text":"perfect drunk/hangover food.... I mean it's taco bell people!! I love their mexican pizzas and cinnamon twists.... The staff is great and never mess up our order :D (not that we go all the time) lol"}
{"text":"OK, it's Taco Bell. You know what you're getting.But at this store, you're NOT getting inexpensive food. A meager little  \"Nacho Cheese Doritos Loco Taco\" (which I might have expected to cost $0.79 - $0.99) actually cost $2.09. Even on the Taco Bell website, it's listed at $1.59. Why is the West View store charging 30%+ more than others?"}
{"text":"Understaffed, slow drive through. They routinely forget condiments. Don't bother coming here anytime near dinner time unless you don't mind waiting 45 minutes"}
{"text":"The cashier here was very rude last time I went. I didn't even complete my order she was so rude, I just left. Looking online at the nutrition facts, I am glad I left, there is basically nothing on the menu I feel comfortable eating after looking at the information on how horrible their rubbish they serve as food really is."}
{"text":"I've go to this location a lot because it's near my job and near my house . Let me start off by saying I love Taco Bell and I probably eat t 3 times a week if not more. This location every time has disappointed me and I go at different times if the day and it's all the same. One time I went and the person working the register told me it was going to be a while . The last time I went is probably gonna be the last time I go. I was on my way to work, 30 minutes before I had to be at work. I order and 15 minutes go by. I ask where my food is and they say it's being made there are people in front  of me. Okay cool. 10 more minutes go by and people who ordered after me are  getting their food . I say I ordered before them and then I am told it goes out in order of size of order. They assure me it's coming out soon. A few more moments go by and the guy Who took my order said it didn't go though on their screen and they will make it right now . I say no I don't have time just give Me my money back I'm going to be Late to work now. He gives me my money back after asking his manager if he can. Then tells me he'll make it and give it to me for free but at this point I have i speed to work because I am already late . I don't know if staff is slow , if they are understaffed or if they just don't care but I've never been so disappointed every time I go there. I hope t gets better but it never does ! 

I would also like to tell the managers to know the promos ! On their drive thru window it says get a 25$ gift card get a free meal but NO ONE knew what I was talking about and couldn't give it to me."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.  This location is HORRIBLE!  We ordered Doritos locos tacos, nachos bell grande and chalupas.  It took 10 minutes to get our dine in order and it wasn't even rush hour.  The employees were in the back joking around while we waited for our food.  When we got our food, the employee attempted to put it on a DIRTY tray and I had to specifically ask for a clean one.  I got an eye roll for that.  Then, instead of receiving cool ranch Doritos tacos, I received regular.  I decided since it took so long, I would just eat them anyways.  The nachos bell grande only had cheese and sour cream.  Rather then take it back, I asked if I could just have some tomatoes to put on it myself.  As well as the side of guac THAT I HAD ORDERED.  I got another eye roll, and the employee proceeded to tell his coworker that it was ridiculous that I was asking for tomatoes and guac.  It doesn't end there.  ALL the tables were dirty, I had to clean one myself.  The floors were disgusting and the soda machine looked like it had never been wiped down.  On top of it all, when we left, the employees were right outside the front door smoking and cracking jokes while people were inside waiting for their orders.  There is a reason people don't frequent the south side for food.  Places like this just make your stomach turn.  Bravo Taco Bell for outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. You're not going to Taco Bell because it's super high quality. You're going because it's cheap and quick. Well - this one isn't quick... More like painfully - almost inexplicably - slow. 

Update: Sitting here in the drive-thru at the 25 minute wait mark I decided, \"You know what? I don't care if it's a Taco Bell. I'm logging onto Yelp and giving it a one-star for insanely slow service\" only to find that I did that the last time I was here two months ago. Well. At least I'm now sure that this location is indeed horrible.  :-/"}
{"text":"They used to exceptional service! Now they lack in that and are lazy with there with build. Today I just in with my dad and got the new nacho stuft box and they didn't even get it right. And all their sour cream smelled like bleach. They need to wash their hands more often. They broke all my taco shells and it's just crazy hopefully they hire on new staff. The dinner crew today were just terrible."}
{"text":"I called this location to ask what time they closed which was 1 AM. We showed up 5 till close and at the drive through they told us they were closed. \"We thought you closed at one\" the drive through lady told us it was one. When we told them no it's 5 till one, that's why we called, they started to tell us what we could order off the menu."}
{"text":"The cashier was friendly, the service was fast, and the lobby was very tidy. \o/"}
{"text":"First of all the speaker by the drive thru menu was out of service so everyone was forced to order and wait for food at the 2nd window. There was 1 person running the show (Yoshi R). 
He was handling cash/credit cards and making the food without washing his hands (which had visible cuts on them). On top of all these disgusting and time consuming things going on I was given habanero sauce instead of creamy jalapeño sauce. Obviously didn't eat my food and didn't want to waste more time trying to get a refund of $2.90. Will never come back to this Taco Bell location again."}
{"text":"Food was ok for an American franchise attempt at Mexican food. The lobby is really cool"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Service was bad, the manager couldn't speak English. He didn't know what he was doing and after a 15 minute transaction his employees had to fix the payment problem that he couldn't. I will never go to this one ever again!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review only after many many times of this location continually getting my order wrong. Whether it be them forgetting to put sour cream on an item I PAID to have it added to, or them not giving me my change. Today they didn't put my hot sauce in the bag after asking me 30 seconds prior if I wanted any... how does it not make it in the bag? It's all in the same vicinity you're standing in! Not to mention they are out of Baja blast at least once a week. I come here pretty often because it's so close to my house, but I'm honestly about to start driving to the one that is 10 minutes away just to stop having to deal with their stupid mistakes. This isn't a once or twice situation, it's a every other visit situation. Save yourself the irritation and go to the next location."}
{"text":"By far the worst taco bell I've ever been to. Waited 25 minutes in the drive thru line, paid and was asked if I wanted sauce then had to wait longer still. I had to ask for sauce tho I was asked when I gave my money. No napkins either. I will never return to this location and will recommend others don't either."}
{"text":"Literally just got home from hitting up the drive thru. The chick at the ordering speaker was laughing taking my order and at a point sounded like she was crying. We pull up to the window, and this chick is stoned out of her mind! Glazed eyes and everything."}
{"text":"Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to go to this Taco Bell!
The food was hot and well prepared
Elijah took an accurate order
Chassidy was a busy bee keeping the lobby clean and was very personable
All the people on the line we efficient and speedy in making the food (I don't know names)
and the Manager Gordon was outside taking the garbage out!
Nothing better than a manager that leads by example and doesn't let the \"button up shirt\" make him to good to take out the trash!
*My only complaint is that my Doritos locos taco had almost no meat in it and the shell was broken."}
{"text":"It's taco bell people. 
This one has nice employees who know how to do their jobs & food is efficient- place is clean & updated.
Nacho cheese & chips are my guilty pleasure-w Baja Blast!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. They're normally very slow so fast food for them is an oxymoron. Tonight we placed an order got home and half the order was wrong."}
{"text":"I'm a personal fan of this Taco Bell because of their super friendly customer service.  There is another Taco Bell closer to me, but I always find myself visiting this one when I get a late night craving for Nachos Bell Grande with extra meat :)

I typically use the drive thru, but on the few occasions that I've been inside the place, it has always been very clean.

The food here always seems to be prepared well and is pretty fresh.  Usually with fast food places, you expect to get a bad meal every once in a while, but I've never had any problems here.

If you're in the area and have a taste for Taco Bell, I recommend giving this store a try."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS KFC. I ATE THERE AND THE FOOD MADE ME SICK. FOOD POISIONING. I bought the 9 piece family bucket. it was all wings and legs with one thigh. NO WHITE MEAT. I got home and my wife wouldn't eat it as she only will eat white meat. So I had to go get her something else to eat. The time before when I went there they were out of original recipe chicken. This was 5:30 pm on a Friday night. I will never eat KFC again. Think I will call the BOARD OF HEALTH on this place."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DISGUISING, DISGUSTING,  DISGUSTING!!! (Location:6520 N. Buffalo 89131)They deserve negative 10 stars. I ordered my food tonight and got home and it had a hair under the cheese of the Mexican Pizza. At the sight of the hair I threw to food up just to me on the safe side. Who knows what else could be in there. I WOULD RATHER BE SAFE THAN SORRY! I tried to call and complain and of course  they didn't answer. It's probably  because they are putting hair in people's food on purpose! I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.  The crew here is fast and friendly, though....so that definitely would be the differentiation for anyone viewing this review."}
{"text":"Have to agree with Brandon. I've been to this Taco Bell 3times since it's closest to me and I get sick everytime and not just upset stomach I mean really really sick. Their food doesn't taste right here, after going to culinary school I'm guessing it's the way they handle it that makes it taste weird and make you sick. Stay away!! I'm thinking of writing corporate about this location, every other one I've been to is fine but this one...something just isn't right! Take the extra five mins and go a little further to another location and avoid getting sick!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and don't have any negative feelings towards it, though I'm not blown away either. After all, it is a Taco Bell.

The staff is friendly and courteous in my experience but on occasion they've forgotten items or gotten confused about orders. Just check your bag before pulling away from the car line and all should be well.

On a side note, I've noticed the staff, rather than hashing out \"Welcome to Taco Bell, may I take your order?\" asks \"Hello, how are you?\" first. I find this bizarre but not bothersome."}
{"text":"I know it's just another Taco Bell but this one is above par haha The customer service is always on point and they seem to be able to keep up with the traffic (its usually slow during the day) but it can be busy for lunch. I've had bad experiences at other locations but this one is always great whether I dine-in or use the drive thru!"}
{"text":"i ordered a double dilla, got a half way filled regular quesadilla not even in the box. i went up the counter to tell them that it was incorrect and the guy told me that no it was correct. wasnt worth the argument so i just sat down. my chips were carelessly thrown in the bag, not even filled up all the way. we told them it was for here but they still bagged it up. the cheese in my half way filled quesadilla wasnt even melted, the whole thing in general was cold. not worth the money!! will not return!"}
{"text":"\"This Taco Bell has the only Long John Silver's that I can find for miles and miles around. I don't eat there often but I get a craving for the fish sometimes. I stopped there yesterday on my way to work but had to get tacos cuz the fish would have been a 12 min. wait. Today I'm calling ahead!! 

I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for Long John Silver's food.  :)"}
{"text":"I always order the chalupa meal and this time I decided to get a side of rice to go along with it. Well I was rather surprised to find that the amount of rice didn't even cover the bottom of the already small container. The rest of my meal was okay but overall disappointing."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is soooooo slow. I've been waiting 10 minutes for my food and the guy before me still hasn't gotten his :("}
{"text":"I was happy to finally get a Taco Bell close to home.  The food is fine, but the wait in the drive thru is atrocious.  Whenever I drive by there are cars in line, and I know from past experience that they'll be idling a long time.  The last time I tried the drive thru, myself and 2 others backed out and left.  And it's a closed-in single lane, so you can't get out if someone is behind you.  It isn't that they are too busy, I think it's that they're understaffed.  One time the employee at the window apologized for the wait, saying there was only 1 person to prepare food for both dine in and drive thru.  And at times I've seen the drive thru cashier going back and forth between the window and the dine in register.  Typically Taco Bells have the fastest drive thru, but this location is the slowest of all local chains in my area."}
{"text":"To me, fast food fulfills a basic need.  Cheap food that's tastes ok and takes a minimum of time and effort to procure.  That is where Taco Bell come into play.  Since it is literally the closest fast food place to my house, I tend to go to it most often so I have a certain affinity towards this location.

I have never been inside so I can't say if its clean or not as I have only used the drive through but from the limited view that I have seen, I haven't seen anything that would scare me away . . .  so far.  What does suck is the parking lot or lack there of.  This location is old and not really meant for people to sit down so there really isn't any parking spaces.  This can make it hard to access the drive thru because of people cutting through to get to their cars or just standing in the way.  Very obnoxious.  But aside from that, after they take your order, they are generally fast and efficient and get you your food into your car quickly.

So if you are driving by and are hungry for some faux mexican, then feel free to stop by and get your Taco Bell fix."}
{"text":"The tall guy in drive thru at night is awesome :) o ly taco bell in town i go to. 
He needs a raose!"}
{"text":"The cash register attended payed no mind she got the order wrong 1.09 I said that's a far cry from 5.49 the taco shells were cracked on the tacos the meat fell on the floor the best thing about the visit was the empanadas slow and easy on those taco shells plz"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night, on my way home from work. Waited 20 minutes on line then another 10 for my food. Got home and all my food was wrong. Went back to get it fixed, gave me the right food but no compensation for having to drive BACK because they got it wrong, ate by myself cause my family already ate theirs. If you make someone wait for their food, atleast make it right !!!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell! Just not this one. I now drive out of my way not to go to this one. The order is wrong Every time and I really mean every time. Bad service Bad food!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is always the last choice for a let night snack. But, when you get your food, you think what took so long."}
{"text":"Very Slow serves, at least pretend to sympathize for how long this take"}
{"text":"Don't show up 15 minutes before close cause you won't be served!! Or even acknowledged."}
{"text":"The night staff is great, they are both friendly and fast. On the other hand, the day staff, around 3pm or so, aren't great at all. There's never usually a wait and it's better than most of the other locations in the county."}
{"text":"They close 30 minutes early, they are rude, and I'll never be back. The other Taco Bell's act so much better than this ghetto location. Rude, rude, and more rude."}
{"text":"food was great....as far as food poisoning...non existent....but bring it on....always love taco bell...even though i make the exact same thing at home...all the way down to meat texture...ill still go there when im not in the mood to duplicate the recipe...:)   still love the place though"}
{"text":"Slow, overall poor service. Enjoy the scenery, you'll be there for a while waiting on a two item order."}
{"text":"Never had a problem at this Taco Bell. Always friendly staff and pretty fast for when they are busy. And what makes it even better, I won a PS4 from the Destiny Promotion they are having!"}
{"text":"We went to the Taco Bell drive thru. 8/23/17 at 9:25 pm.  Made and order and at the end order our drinks.  We asked for a medium DP and then if they had pepsi or coke products.  We were told we only have sweet and unsweetened tea this was confusing since the question was about the products.  We asked the person do you have any soda he said yes but you asked about tea.  Even tho we didn't ask about tea we continued with do you have pepsi the person replied with yes we do and you ordered a tea.  No we ordered a DP a Dr. Pepper.  The person said well why didn't you just order it that way and say Dr Pepper.  Then we say why are being so rude his reply was why didn't you just order a Dr Pepper is there anything else with this order.  We cancled the order and went to a different location"}
{"text":"This bathroom is so disgusting I did not even order food. I walked right out. I will spare everyone the gruesome details, but I figured if anyone working here uses this restroom, I don't want them touching my food!
Those customers using the drive-through are oblivious to the conditions inside..."}
{"text":"I have been frequently visiting this Taco Bell by the mall as an alternative to the other one on Springfield Ave (see that review) but now I may be out of luck on all Taco Bell in this area. I used the bathroom and found there was NO SOAP! If I cannot wash my hands in the bathroom, where are the people preparing my food washing their hands?!? Food has always been ok but the soap issue is a deal breaker.
I elected not to order any food and left to go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"They didn't get our order right. We asked for a side of nacho cheese and beans and it was seriously a sample cup and we got charged two dollars for it. They didn't give us a receipt. Honestly....what the heck....never again."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant that always gets my order right.  Thats important when dealing with the typical teen-age employee who has a hard time remembering his own name, let alone an order for food he/she has been trained to prepare.  The only creepy thing was there was an actual he/she working the drive-thru window.  I'm pretty sure it was a dude in full chick make-up.  At least he/she got my order right."}
{"text":"The doritos locos taco is very overhyped I am sad to say.  I was very excited after seeing commercials as I am a big Doritos fan and hoped they would do a cool ranch one and then they did!  Sadly it is not as dreamy as I thought it would be :("}
{"text":"I ordered some Long John Silver food, the food was cold and as I drove all the way to my hosue I found out  they gave me the wrong order. Plus the lady at the drive thru window was rude."}
{"text":"I've been waiting at the drive-thru for 15 minutes and there's still 3 cars ahead of me. This is not \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Friendly, and fast drive threw."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just so I could write a review for this particular Taco Bell.  The service was decent, but the food was absolutely terrible.  I ordered at 830 on a Thursday and every taco shell and tortilla was hard and stale.  I had a chicken cheesy gordita crunch and it was absolutely inedible.  I threw out the gordita and 1 and a half tacos.  Hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a Taco Bell and I frequent them often."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Taco Bells to choose from in the Vegas Valley and unless your like me and this one is close by or its just on the way then pass it up!

There's nothing really wrong with this Taco Bell in general but every time we are craving some TB we go here because its the only one near by and they just drive me crazy because they never have the new burrito or taco and always seem to run out of the items that I want or like. I mean how can you advertise the new Nacho burrito all over the place and don't have it or we are sorry we ran out of those right now. Wait what. how the crap do you run out of tortia chips, cheese, beef, beans and tortias when that's what you do!

All in all its a taco bell and honestly when it comes to the flavor and service its pretty much the same. Sometimes there are good employees there that care sometimes there's not and its not the locations fault its the young dumb kid behind the counter! So I can't blame TB franchise for that. 

As far as there seating area its pretty large for a taco bell. typically clean and just as any TB you get your food done the same and fast!"}
{"text":"By far the cleanest Taco Bell I have ever been to! The staff was very friendly, our food was ready super fast and the manager actually went from table to table asking how the food was (which I have never seen at a fast food restaurant) and she gave everyone a coupon to try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. You get what you should expect from fast food, BUT I really despise the way the drive thru is handled. I'm assuming the employees are instructed to be overly friendly. That would be fine, but they go over the top. It's off putting and unprofessional. I don't want to hear how your high school girlfriend makes you spend all your money on her hair and nails. I do not want a guy 15+ years my junior calling me \"sweetie\" five times in one transaction.  I just want nachos, dangit."}
{"text":"When you go to this tacobell make sure u get ur extra sauce they told me only ONE package per item!!?!really who uses just ONE"}
{"text":"I strongly agree! This is by far the best Taco Bell! Service is outstanding! Arkiel and his crew are the most professional and courteous employees that I've encountered. We will be returning and letting others know what makes this place better than the rest. Thank you Arkiel! Sorry if I misspelled your name. We'll be back! Oh, and be careful Taco Bell...I'm going to have to steal your employee!"}
{"text":"Customer service is the best I've ever experienced Ina fast food restaurant and this includes chickfila. The food is...well Taco Bell. You get what you expect."}
{"text":"Almost an hour wait at drive-thru? Is this normal wait time? Wow!!! I'm impressed! This is the longest I have ever waited at the drive-thru! And guess what? You can't just up and leave, either!"}
{"text":"Clueless staff with little to no initiative, horrible wait times, and food sloppily thrown together. Sometimes the food is so bad it's not even edible, like it's days old or not stored properly or something."}
{"text":"This the second time we ate here, place is always dirty, seats and table's not wipe down or clean. This customers tray has been sitting near us, full of trash for about 30 mins while 1 employees are talking at another table for about 30 mins or more."}
{"text":"Absolute FILTHY shit hole----avoid it like the PLAGUE !!!!!!!
Staff are all mindless nimrods!!!!!!
This dump should be closed!!"}
{"text":"I went in the restaurant the other night and ordered almost $30 worth of food. Asked for a bigger bag to carry all the other little bags they have my food in and the manager was very short in saying  they were out!!!!
  At  6:30 PM???  Place is not really clean"}
{"text":"hit this location up late one night, ordered the 3 Doritos RANCH tacos bundle, but received 1 Ranch, and 2 cheddar's...how do you mess up that order, the Ranch shells are tan colored, and the cheddar are orange. I guess they missed the \"paint by numbers\" skills in Pre-school."}
{"text":"Usually when I eat here I go to the bathroom within an hour with diarrhea but after last night's meal I've been constipated for the last 24 hours, this is not the Taco Bell I accustomed to."}
{"text":"Hands-down the slowest damn Taco Bell in town! 25 minutes for a \"fast food\" drive-through...... No way!"}
{"text":"I went inside for my order and the cashier was the friendliest cashier I've ever had at any fast food restaurant before. He was very nice and made sure that if I needed anything I could just ask and I wouldn't have felt like a pest if I did honestly. When I'm around this Taco Bell, I just might have to stop by more often. The food is great too. This is the first Taco Bell I've eaten at where my tacos WEREN'T soggy. No complaints about this Taco Bell whatsoever."}
{"text":"The good is always hot and fresh! It's convenient for me to walk across the parking lot on my lunch break to grab something to eat. The customer service is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Fine establishment good food. Service was so friendly it made me want to work there. Taco Bell is and always be in my heart I love all the workers like they are my children.  when the worker handed me the food I wanted to kiss him on the spot. Thank you Taco Bell you are the Michael Jordan of fast food."}
{"text":"Very delicious, I recommend this place very highly. No problems at all. Quesadilla was cooked to perfection and the taco's were amazing. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just got a late night snack before calling it a night from this establishment and was told at the drive thru that they ran it of seasoned beef and all they have is chicken or steak and if i got the chicken or steak it would be an up charge. I asked the young lady at the window is that why 3 cars left in front if me and her answer was yes and she is only doing what she was told to say from her Mgr, CALVIN. I explained to her that I wanted to talk to Calvin waited an addl 20 minutes and just left.,  WORST customer service ever and BIG disrespect. This will be the 2nd time thus happened, but I wasn't going to let it go this time. If I could give a - 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell EVER- 1 star is being generous!!!  We went in to the store and ordered at 9:31 PM (time stamped on the receipt).  We sat and waited and waited and waited for our food.  We finally got our food at 9:52 and it is WRONG!  We went back up to the counter and were treated like we were being A-holes for asking for the food we actually ordered instead of what they gave us.  We got the correct food at 9:58 and had literally just sat down to start eating when one of the employees walks up to our table and says \"You need to leave now.  We close at 10 and all customers need to get out the door before 10:00\".  She walks away with no offer to get us a bag for our food so we try to collect and carry everything out.  The employees are standing by the door waiting for us to leave so that they can lock the door and go home.  If the staff hadn't been incompetent and taken 20 minutes and two tries to get us our food we would have had plenty of time to eat before we were kicked out.  This is not our first bad experience at this location- twice we have waited 20 plus minutes in the drive thru for our food and once we sat at the menu board 10 minutes just waiting for someone to take our order before we drove away and saw 4 employees just standing around chatting and laughing as we passed the drive thru window."}
{"text":"By far the slowest service of any Taco bell I've been to. Average wait time per car in the drive thru at lunch ours is over five minutes. I had three cars in front of me and waited nearly 20 minutes, ridiculous!. It's always the same older Indian lady at the window and she clearly gets flustered any time the have a few cars in the line. Hire new staff!"}
{"text":"Has to be the cleanest and best run Taco Bell I've ever seen!!!  Add friendly staff, good food and reasonable prices...nice!"}
{"text":"Not so fast... fast food. But still good!

I have driven through this Taco Bell at different times (usually evening and late night). And while the food is well prepared and put together and usually correct. It has taken a while for fast-food. However, I rated them a little higher because the staff have always been friendly and easy to hear/understand, the food/order is correct and well put together. 

Check them out... 
enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always fast & the FRIENDLIEST workers around! Great drinks & vegetarian fast food YUM"}
{"text":"When I order Diablo sauce they give me Weak sauce. They owe me at least $15 in gas reimbursement from having to drive back to obtain items I paid for and did not receive. I live 0.1 miles away."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. They would not honor their Diamondbacks special. I have not been to Taco Bell for over a year because of my bad experience, guess this place hasn't changed! Give Del Taco over on Ray & Dobson your business instead of this place!"}
{"text":"I am literally sitting here waiting for my food I ordered about 10 Min ago. There's been a truck in front of me waiting at the window for about 9 min. This is the last time I'm coming to this shitty taco bell. Fire these little kids you have as staff"}
{"text":"Look, its a Taco Bell. Rating it against a fine Mexican dining experience doesn't make sense to me, so keep in mind that my rating is compared to other Taco Bells. The food tastes exactly like other T. Bells, which is the point of a franchise. However, this place is decorated very nicely, and its always clean. Every time I'm there, which is often, the service is way above average for any fast food joint. Oh man, writing this just gave me a craving for my 4th meal!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with another reviewer.  Twice I have come through drive through and sat in silence for at least 5 minutes before someone took my order.  Maybe it was shift change?

We always get tostadas without the chipotle sauce (twice I've gotten home to find that they still put the chipotle sauce on and my esophagus burned to ashes) and a bean burrito. 

Overall good food for a decent price.  Drinks are overpriced unless you go during Happy Hour(s?) 2-5p.

My son loves taco Bell, so unless they open a location closer to Dormont, we'll keep coming here."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely excellent. Our cashier was really nice and polite and the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"The service is always awesome. Yeah, it's fast food but at least it's decent(: love love love this taco bell. Its mah favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 soft shell tacos. Probably about 1 tablespoon of meat on each one. We felt like we were eating salad on a shell. A bad salad on a shell. Not impressed. Went straight to McDonalds from there. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Wrong items received, wasnt given a receipt, if you call them they never answer,no voicemail set up, long wait times during dinner rush hour."}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell I've been to by far. It's the nearest one to my house but it's service is terrible. Today was no different, I went through the drive through, no one in front of me and it took a bit for the girl to realize I was waiting, then when she greeted us through the microphone, we asked how she was doing and she started laughing menacingly at us, for no reason at all. Then at the window she did not greet us, we greeted her and were polite, we said thank you to her when she handed us our food to which she gave us a dumb look for about 15 seconds and that was it. Also she made my chicken smothered Burrito super dry. Make sure you guys speak to Elizabeth and train her to have better customer service skills."}
{"text":"This location is very, very dirty. Everything needs a good scrubbing and continued maintenance needs made here. The service is lackluster."}
{"text":"Very good service. Best Taco Bell in Madison. By far.  Managers are phenomenal. Food is great.  Service on point."}
{"text":"Standard fare! They get busy and might take a little longer but have not had a messed up order. As opposed to the one near park rd shopping center where they screw up orders all the time."}
{"text":"Always got problems every visit guaranteed. Or lack there of visit. One time its missing two burritos, another time there was a long blonde hair in my burrito.  Another time they closed 10 min before their posted closing time. *Always check your bag before pulling out of drive thru**"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quick and competent staff here. Normally not one to be impressed with fast food, I was delighted to get above and beyond service. A+ awesome!"}
{"text":"I work alot on this side of town sometimes and each tine I do I'll stop by here. I'm usually not one to care about my fast food service but every time I come here the ladies are very kind and timing is Prety good too. Always very clean from what I've seen and very friendly. I see some of the complaints here about it being busy and the wait and or them being able to clean. I worked in the fast food industry when I was younger so I understand how hard it gets when its busy, especially witg a small staff it seems like they have here but I think the are extraordinary here. Best Taco Bell in Phoenix keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell I have ever been to.  The service and wait times have been terrible almost every time I've been there.  I would actually drive to the Taco Bell in Champaign instead even though this one was much closer.

If you go after 8pm, they definitely have their \"C\" team working, can't get anything right and slow as hell."}
{"text":"As stated below, management here clearly has no idea how to run a fast food restaurant.  My family and I have left the drive thru line twice now in the last three months because of their \"service\".  The first time, there was a problem with the cash register, which they did not tell us about until after 7 minutes of sitting in the drive thru line.  And then they said it would take just a minute to fix.  Lo and behold, after 7 more minutes of waiting with no one coming back to let us know what was happening, we drove away. 

 Last night, we decided to try again.  The old saying holds true (fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice...) Again, we waited at least 5 minutes in the drive thru before moving.  When we finally made it to the speaker to order, we gave our order, the gentleman on the inside told us he needed us to say it again, which my husband repeated, and no one came back to let us know we were good to go.  We waited 5 minutes trying to get someone to come back to talk to us, all the while the cars in front of us had not moved anywhere closer to the window to get their own orders.  Corporate needs to come here and clean house.  Their service is awful."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. What did you expect? That being said, when you're drunk, or really hungover. This place will do the trick. I recommend the Crunch Wrap Supreme. Slammin'."}
{"text":"Very good quesarito the restaurant needs an update though the workers are very friendly and professional. Overall this is the best Taco Bell in this area and the food is way better than other Taco Bells in the area."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is so F'ing dirty! The place was empty except for the employees standing around talking and eating and every single table was dirty. I had to wipe one off myself just to be able to sit down. The floor was dirty. So sad!! This place is terrible and needs new management. I'm surprised it passes health inspections and I'm not surprised it is empty. I count six employees and they are all standing around. This owner should be ashamed!! It isn't like the bar is that high but this is by far the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to."}
{"text":"There was a rather large female employee sitting on the curb by the dumpster smoking a cigarette, no big deal. Then I parked and walked in to order. Listen, I'm a bit over weight too. I was approached by a very heavy male cashier, who kept touching his mouth and greasy face. It grossed me out so I left. You would think that being in the restaurant business you would train your staff proper hygiene. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good at getting the orders out quickly and most importantly getting everything you order in the bag. I did get the splats after eating here the last time but I can't be 100% sure it was from this food here, but it doesn't matter I will still keep going."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst taco bell establishment in Charlotte. I visited this location around 5pm on a Saturday. This particular Taco Bell is fused with a KFC. As I pull up to the ordering box I sat there for about 5 minutes waiting to order. Finally once I was greeted I reissued my order 4 times before deciding this was not going to work so I should go inside to order. Once I went inside I saw why he couldn't understand me clear . The employees were playing around , laughing an one was even dancing. As I waited for my food I witnessed 3 separate people come in an complain that their orders were not correct from the drive through. One even mentioned that his order from KFC was missing 3 pieces of chicken. So after I receive my food of course my order was incorrect. I simply asked for a refund an left."}
{"text":"Horrible! I went there the day after their \"Grand Opening\" day for lunch with a coworker. This was the most wasted lunch money since I've worked in the area and I definitely felt cheated. 

They charge extra for things that used to be included with the dish I ordered. The \"meat\" was practically missing in action. 

The only thing good about the place was that it is a newly constructed site so there was no chance of it being dirty yet. 

The food certainly was not worth what I paid and we won't be dining there again. 

Very disappointing because we were so very badly in need of a new place to eat around MLK & W. Lake Mead. Thank goodness for El Pollo Loco across the street."}
{"text":"Waited for 20 minutes in line before they even took the order of the car in front of me and then sat for another 20 minutes before I even got to the drive through window. By the time I was out of the line there was a line of cars back towards the 3 way intersection on Braddock. Terribly unorganized and zero work ethic."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The staff is slow and the orders are rarely correct. They post hours til 4 am on weekends but are rarely open past 3. They say they open at 7 but I had to wait 15 minutes for them to turn the computers on. Just go further down east wash if you need a crappy taco fix. But if you get Tamara in the drive thru at night,  you're golden. That girl is awesome."}
{"text":"Have been going here for YEARS with no problem..... Tonight was a nightmare!    There were only two cars ahead of me in the drive-through. It took me 10 minutes to get to the speaker where I could order. Then an additional 8 minutes to get to the first window to pay.  When I mentioned this to the cashier she corrected me and said no it was only 7 minutes since I had ordered.   She said that they were training a new person..... At 6 PM on a Sunday night?????  There were 4 or 5 cars behind me, by the way.   OK that was all the good part of this visit. 

Now onto the problem!  When I got to the window, the clerked SNAPPED at me, \"Hot or mild!?\"  I told her and I verified, \"Two combo tostadas?\"  She snapped again and yelled back to cook, \"Ugh, you wanted COMBO tostadas?\"  The cook confirmed.  She looked over at the girl at the first window and ROLLED HER EYES!  I'm still in shock.
I've read through other reviews and found them to be similar.  Apparently corporate doesn't read Yelp, so I'm calling them tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I got a number 10 and it was the best I have had in a long time!!! It was just right in all ingredients. I did have to wait for a bit but once the realized I was there they stopped doing what they were doing and came over. The only reason I give them 4 stars this visit is because they did not have any Dr. Pepper!! But I cànt blame them for not having the world's most wanted drink"}
{"text":"I have gone to this Taco Bell regularly over the years.  Food is fine and I like the new redesign they did of the building.  They used to process drive through orders very quickly even when there was a long line.  I am sad to say the service has been noticeably worse lately.  Staff not as friendly...much longer wait at the drive through, and the worst part is the orders have been messed up numerous times.  This never used to happen here.  I hope some changes are made so later reviews can be more positive."}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell/KFC  I've ever been to.  I have waited a half hour in the drive-through line before, and even when you're at the window it can take 10 or even 15 minutes to get your food. Today I ordered 2 cheese rollups and a drink. I was first in line at the window and still had to wait over 10 minutes. Then when I finally got my food, I drove off without checking in the bag first. They charged me for 2 rollups and only gave me one. I realize it is very difficult to make cheese rollups and then count them too, but that's what a Taco Bell employee must aspire to. By the way, I tried to go to two different websites to complain. The KFC website just asked if you were satisfied with your meal, to which I checked \"no\" and then got a message saying that I didn't win their sweepstakes. No follow-up whatsoever. The Taco Bell website was more detailed but when I hit \"submit\" I got an error message. I am so done with this restaurant and will just learn to live without their food....I'm NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Recently just went here after a year of refusing to in hopes that the customer service as well as quality of food would be improved. Sadly I was disappointed. Upon arriving it took several minutes of giving our order multiple times for them to get it correct on the screen. Then pulling up to the window we again waited several minutes to be helped. Meanwhile, could see all four workers inside joking and eating, and when they saw us they made sure to move out of our view to continue talking for several more minutes. When one worker finally came to the window, we were asked if we even ordered. In which my husband had to then have our order taken again. After ordering for what seemed the tenth time we then waited another 15 minutes to recieve a deal d and bean burrito. All the while watching the workers make our food without gloves. We were horrified. To say the least if I could give this place any negative of a review I would. We will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is about the same as any other I've been too.  Service is okay, food quality is below average and prices run a bit higher then is justified.  

Much better food is available up and down Harris, no need to go to sub par places."}
{"text":"Honestly, the bar is low for Taco Bell; I realize what I'm getting into every time I order that crunch wrap supreme. However, this particular Taco Bell is next level awful. They mess up our order EVERY. Single. Time. (And not forgetting you said no tomatoes but forgetting chicken in your chicken cantina bowl or black beans in your cantina bowl ... or ya know, both plus a taco for kicks). Yet, I've continued go back bc chalupa are delicious and this is in my neighborhood. Well, NEVER AGAIN; they gave us food poisoning and while I shouldn't be surprised, I hope this can serve as a warning for someone else. This Taco Bell is officially the worst."}
{"text":"This taco bell is close t my home and we enjoy it! They've never gotten our order wrong. However they tend to close before they are supposed to but no overall issues."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is one of my favorites. Quick to get in and out. The food is good and hits the spot every time. Clerks are nice. Too many high school kids hang around sometimes, but that must be due to the cheap prices. Prefer this over Del taco...better hot sauce too! Like someone else mentioned...the parking lot can be crazy!"}
{"text":"This taco bell was the epitome of what service should look like!  Clean Environment,  Organized Sauce Packets,  Not Just Friendly BUT Authentically Happy Employees. They have a dedicated wall for thank you notes and another wall stating their motto. It was a pleasant experience that I believe ALL taco bell restaurants should give!"}
{"text":"If i could give less than 1 star i would. Worst taco bell experience ever! I never go to this location and I won't again. I used the mobile app to order almost $30 in food. I received a confirmation email and my card was charged like normal. (Note: I use the app weekly) So I get to the store and select drive through as my pick up option, I get to the order box and they say they can't find my order. I waited about 10 min and they still couldn't find my order so I told them I would come inside. I ended up having to re-order the entire order which meant I had to call everyone who was on the order and get their orders from them ( which everything was custom, that's why we used the app) anyway after about 20 min I  finally get our food and I'm missing a single crunchy taco. So I let them know that I still need a crunchy taco and they proceed to take all of my food back out of the bag and count all of it. After a couple min they tell me that I have everything and I'm not missing anything. I counted the items with them multiple times and they still tried telling me I had everything. Finally they realize they're wrong and them give me the wrong taco, even though I was standing there saying \"no, not that kind, just a regular crunchy taco\". They completely ignored me. After that I just took the food and left not wanting to bother with them anymore. So I get home and give everyone their food but because the staff stood there and argued with me that I wasn't missing a taco all of the other tacos were soggy and gross. They didn't get eaten. I usually would not complain because I know how hard service jobs can be but the staff was inconsiderate and just looked at me like they I was in the wrong the whole time. Rude, inconsiderate, incompetent staff. I will never return to this location and I will tell my friends and family to avoid it."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner with a friend and order a combo meal. As I was eating I unwrapped my taco and it was soaking wet and just wasn't edible. We took it up to the counter and the Restaurant GENERAL manager said oh well it has been sitting there. Seriously?! Learn a thing or two about customer service. I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Long unneCessary waits sometimes!
 ..... Poor customer service.  Which leads me to believe, unsanitary practices are being performed here possibly. Avoid this place if u want"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. They messed up my order twice. Tacos were soggy and hardly had anyway meat. Customer service was horrible to. They were rude and had no customer service skills."}
{"text":"I love taco bell more than most. I know it's not healthy but I enjoy it. Especially the Baja blast. Now every time I come into this taco bell after 4 or 5 they get my order wrong. Seriously I'm not exaggerating they get something wrong every time. Now I started going to a taco bell that is further away because of this. Most times I'm just getting Baja blast yet now I have to drive to a taco bell that is out of my way for one drink. Sucks but I'm tired of them always getting my order wrong or forgetting things."}
{"text":"When in Las Vegas NV. Do not eat at this Taco Bell. They are rude and arrogant to the point of not apologizing, refunding or offer to replace the meal when the order is incorrect. No offers to replace the order or refund the money even with a receipt. They blame the customer instead of their staff when an order is incorrect. The management staff when asked if this was a franchise or corporate store the answer was a franchise. When management was asked for the franchise name and contact information he (Manager Andy) said he did not know that information. He said he did not know who he worked for or who pays him. Imagine that! Called 800-TACO-BELL to find out who the franchise owner is and to get the contact information but Taco Bell's corporate customer service is only available 11am-7pm eastern time. Imagine that. A world of slackers and they are proud of it."}
{"text":"Decent service, good food. Try to avoid going late at night. Slower service."}
{"text":"I have stopped at this Taco Bell location 3 times this week and each of those times I was satisfied! I love the new $1 cravings menu. I always order the spicy potato soft taco! It's a soft shell with crispy potatoes, lettuce, shredded cheese, and a creamy chipotle sauce. The original potato soft taco was good but I love spicy foods so the creamy chipotle sauce really makes it. The spicy tostada is also good! I tried the new cheesy bean and rice burrito the other day. It's a new $1 item too. If you like refried beans, rice, nacho cheese, and a creamy jalapeño sauce then this burrito is for you. It is definitely worth a dollar, it's pretty big. I will be back because this location is great. All of the staff I have encountered have been nice and my order was right every time. The food is also yummy for fast food! It's also open until 2-3am which is convenient."}
{"text":"Rude drive thru service EVERY time@ and I am so overly nice to people when I talk to them \"please, thank you etc....\"
Toatally  ticks me off when people are so rude and ARE GETTING PAID!!!!!!!!! THIS WHY U DON'T DESERVE $15 A HOUR!!!"}
{"text":"Well friendly service is about the only positive I can give for this location. I waited too long at the window for my food. No one was in the drive-thru, but service was slow enough for the guy to tell me \"sorry for the wait.\" I had a hunch to check my order (something I do not practice routinely) and noticed they forgot my tacos. I got home about 7 min later to eat my food as soon as I arrived home, only to experience soggy food! Yuck! Boo hoo! I'll stick to home made tacos with a bag of Doritos on the side!"}
{"text":"I don't have a problem with the food or location. If anything, I'm glad there's a drive thru pizza place near me. That said, the drive thru takes an extremely long time to get through. An EXTREMELY long time."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever eaten little red chips they put in the food were so rancid ew never ever going back !!! Garbage!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food here literally tasted like God made it with his own two hands. The customer service was so clutch I actually smiled. However, I'm really upset that one night through the drive-thru, my friend and I wanted to jeep with these cool kids in front of us, and they wouldn't let us jeep with them. I've never been so offended in my life. BUT U KNOW HOW THAT STUFF GOES. GR8 FOOD THO THANKS AGAIN"}
{"text":"Since this a Taco Bell, (A chain restaurant), you would expect the food to be predictable.  It was indeed that.  However, I visited this location during a relatively slow time.  Therefore, you would think that the floors would be swept, and the tables would be clean and spotless.  This was not the case. The environment left a lot to be desired. Perhaps this Taco Bell should be considered as only a drive thru destination?"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite taco bell in the Madison area. Polite staff, fairly quick service, food was seemingly always hot, fresh, and well put together compared to other locations. Having worked in the fast food/restaurant industry myself at one point in time, I know how ridiculous, rude, and belittling people can be, sometimes for no good reason. I strive to be as kind, understanding, and polite as I can be but this situation is one I cannot just overlook (again). On two separate occasions we have ordered a chicken quesadilla and after getting no more than half way through eating it discover a VERY LONG hair in the middle. TWICE! There is next to NOTHING more disgusting and unsanitary than having to pull a long unidentified hair out of your mouth that was unknowingly consumed with your dinner! It's so sickening I could puke, and both times the rest of our order was obviously thrown away. I did not complain the first time which was 3 or 4 months ago but we haven't eaten there since until tonight and sure enough, hair in the food AGAIN. I called the manager \"Jenna\" who apologized and offered to remake it for us...NO THANK YOU! The only reason I called was to bring it to their attention because it's so completely unacceptable. If it happened to us twice, surely it's happened to someone else. GROSS! I will never eat there again...I'd advise checking your food before you eat it people!"}
{"text":"Took a drive through. They took long time to get my order ready and gave me the wrong order. Awful never going here again."}
{"text":"Can i give it a 0 star ( were closed ) the bamba bamba big woman said wen we arrived at 3.05 a.m and they closed at 4 a.m what a shit"}
{"text":"Bought a personal pan pizza at aprox 2 pm. Wife got a taco. I am now throwing up pizza now since 7 pm. Food poisoning. Stay away"}
{"text":"Giving them one star to just write my review. 0/5. Place smells and zero manners in management staff. We don't need robots to work here, just asking for customer service and listening skills."}
{"text":"My food was cold and they forgot half my order :-/  I normally check my bag but didn't for some reason until I was home. There were lettuce pieces in my bean burrito ( quality control issues )."}
{"text":"Very Poor! Messed Up Our Order then had to drive back and wait for all the other people to be taken of before they could fix our order. Very Poor Customer Services!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is always clean the people are always friendly but the orders are never right it always seems that they forget something when you drive through or carry out I would say this would only be in the current once in a while but in the last seven times that we've been there it's happened five times Rivers quality control in the orders before they go out is not doing very well other than that the food is prepared well it's not prepared sloppy quality of food does Taco Bell's probably one of the best just wish they would get all the food in the bag"}
{"text":"Drive-thru was wrapped around the building during lunch. Inside, the cashier didn't ask how could he help me; just looked at me. The wait inside was horrible, and the lobby was not clean."}
{"text":"Wow. You guys should really work on ur service and quality control. Please make sure you provide atleast what u are paid for . Incomplete order !!!!!! Atleast can I get my money back please...."}
{"text":"Just left the drive through and ordered the double chalupa! When they gave me my food I checked it and the chalupa was half of what was in the picture advertised as a nicely stuffed chalupa! I asked the lady I'm the drive through if I could have it like in the photo! She said she couldn't touch it as I handed it to her and then asked me to give her a second and she came back shortly and asked for the chalupa! She almost immediately returned and when she did she showed me my chalupa and I said it was fine. I get to back to work starving and when I bite my chalupa it was so obvious all that did was filled it in with lettuce! Now I'm stuck here at work and have to starve for the remainder of my 12 hour shift that I'm not even halfway through. I called them back and they offered me to drive all the way back and they make me another for what will be the third time!  this was literally 15 mins ago and it's not right for consumers to have to go through this! I will not be going back there again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Run Taco Bell I have ever been to.  We waited inside over 20 min for our order while they serviced car after car in the drive through line. Great info if you're going to use drive through. We were third in line and the guy in front of us had been waiting 5 min longer and complaints to the counter didn't matter. Real Mexican food is quicker than this stop. Visit this location at your own risk."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell that I've ever seen. The last time i went here, it was about 11:00 p.m. I sat in the drive thru for 10 mins and it never moved. There were about 4 cars in front of me. Left. Went to Cook-Out. When i drove back by with my food, the same cars were sitting in line. 

Today, i walked inside. Stood there for ten minutes while the workers joked and laughed about snap chat. Left. Cook-out got my business again. I will not be back."}
{"text":"While this location sucks at planning (they ran out of syrup for the pop machine), the food on hand was decent and filling. Not 5 star, but good value for the money."}
{"text":"Since my last post, I am so cold when We eat here, summer, fall, winter, spring,  We always need jackets!  that is the only way We will go is when I use drive through.  BTW, I don't like drive through eating.  When I asked the crew about why is was so cold they said that they need it that cold for the back room......NEWS FLASH, TO THE OWNER OPERATOR,....call,the AC company and have them come and balance your units.  You are paying a fortune for your AC!  I think your crew is costing you a small fortune!"}
{"text":"Usually good during the day, friendly staff, but the night staff are completely carless & 9 times out of 10 get my order wrong. The food quality isn't poor but there is always something wrong when I go at night. Even though it is my local TB, this location causes me more frustration than anything."}
{"text":"The food was hot, fresh, and tasty. Very friendly service. The food is so good it's worth the farts afterwards if you have stomach problems like me lol :)

If only I could get gas for $1.69
I'd have so much money saved up to buy more burritos from Taco Bell! Great Place 5/5 stars"}
{"text":"The drive through needs improvement.  It took me approximately 13 to 15 minutes to get through and there was only 4 cars ahead of me. They need to hire more people and use both windows to make it more streamlined. I've always wondered why there was so many cars in the drive through, now I know.  The drive through attendant was very friendly though."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, especially with the Dbacks special (6 runs in a game, 3 free tacos with large drink purchase)  this location is also relevantly close to my house (within walking distance) 
as far as their food goes, I have never had a problem with the food, it always tastes good enough. 
all of the staff is friendly (most of the time) I have never had any real problem with any of the workers.
They are as fast as they should be for a fast food restaurant, never had to wait more than a few minutes to receive my order from the time I arrive
one thing about this particular location that does bother me is that there are homeless people (different people on different occasions) that hang out near the dumpster... In my opinion management should do something to run them off or in a recent case of crazed hobo the employee told someone I know to calm down and it's ok if the crazy hobo comes up and talks to their car because he was a \"Mentally disturbed\" homeless war vet. in my opinion that makes it even worse.
A few weird experiences isn't gonna stop me from going here although they may not considering there is a taco bell at cave creek/bell."}
{"text":"The staff is really nice, they rarely if ever mess up my orders which are usually complicated and require alterations or substitutions, they don't skimp on the hot sauce packets or napkins, the service is always really fast and friendly, and the food is very reasonably priced if you order a la carte. I've found that most combo meals aren't the greatest value (especially because there's a circle K right across the street, you can go get a drink there for 85 cents unless you want baja blast) other than maybe the taco box. But yeah, pretty much everything you could ask for from a taco bell. You should know what you're getting into. This taco bell meets expectations, and in a time where customer service can easily fall by the wayside, this a five-star in my book."}
{"text":"Taco meat, taco meat, are you real or are you fake? Doesn't matter, hot or fire. Saucy, bossy cheese and beef."}
{"text":"It's your standard fare with everything as one might expect, however, the people that work here are very good. Service, care, and cleanliness. These good people work hard and it shows."}
{"text":"Nope! First and last time here. It smells like a franchisee store and a cheap one at that.  Doing the minimum that Corp requires. Outdated pastel blue and pink seats.  Old arched window design.  No Wi-Fi.  Come on man. Typical employees there for a paycheck or two or the who's who of low self esteem being exploited by a cheap low life owner. Plenty of other option to eat near here.  I'm actually the only one here at 4pm on a Saturday lol"}
{"text":"I normally do not post reviews but this has happened more than 5 times.  When I order EXTRA jalapeno sauce on the quesadilla,  it doesn't mean NO sauce...  It changes the flavor very much and I don't want to eat a cheese tortilla. It normally goes into the trash or to my dog."}
{"text":"Food? just sad. Beef tacos should have beef as an ingredient. The order was missing a taco on it, but it saved me money that she forgot to add it. They are that bad."}
{"text":"This relatively new Taco Bell sets the bar for fast food experiences.  I often stop there after a late night out and it's always a good experience.  All of the people working the window are friendly and patient (especially when the car full of drunk idiots ahead of me orders $100 in food).  The cashier is quick and efficient, and the food usually appears fast.  

I often put in special orders there (hold this, add that, etc).  They are never rude about it and my orders are always right.  The food, especially for a Taco Bell, is really good.  Everything is made quick and is as tasty as you'd expect.  My only (teeny-tiny) issue with his restaurant is that they advertise being open 24 hours on the weekend but the often turn off the griller around 5am when I cruise in after a long night of poker downtown.  Still, on the whole an excellent fast food stop in West Park."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell doesn't participate with the national advertised pricing. Fairly recently they began charging more for all the current special combos advertised on tacobell.com. Other locations nearby match advertised pricing, so even though I live practically next door I drive a few minutes away now for the principle of the matter. Check out the app or and/or compare ordering a current special online from this vs. other locations and you will see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I find the food at this establishment to be edible. We visited recently and an employee named Ashley helped us out a lot. She excitedly gushed to us that the entire kitchen was filthy, nobody washed the dishes, and the food was garbage whilst dropping several f bombs in front of a small child. She then left. I ate several combinations of meat bread and cheese and then I was happy. We got free cinnamon twists....bomb!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Taco Bell because the employees are consistently very friendly and efficient. Food and facility are the same as any other Taco Bell but the staff make all the difference."}
{"text":"This is consistently the slowest taco bell and fast food restaurant I have ever encountered. I've been here several times and the story is always the same. In fact, I have time to write this review while I am waiting in the drive thru line. The food is usually fine, but I think I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Taco Bell, however kinda disappointed with this location.  A month ago I ordered a mountain dew blast, and the machine was broken.  So I thought,  bummer,  maybe next time.  Two weeks later,  still broken.  Finally a month later I thought for sure I could order one,  nope. When asking the lady why haven't they fixed it,  HER response to me is \" I don't know how to fix it , THAT IS NOT MY JOB \"  I looked for a name tag, but she was not wearing one.  I called to speak to the manager, he  didn't apologize for any inconvenience,  he argues that it is not mandatory for name tags anymore.  He also states he has been asking his corporate office for a new machine and that's all he could do.  WAY TO GO  TACO BELL! I have  changed my mind about this company, not a favorite anymore."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered last night. The staff was really friendly and my order was ready fast af. My cashier named Chanina was great. She was fine af. I wouldn't even pull out."}
{"text":"It seems this has a pattern. Very slow drive through and taco's weren't tasty at all. 

1 Star!"}
{"text":"Opens 7am. Suuuuuure it does. Good luck getting breakfast here. I'm sat in the drive through for 5 min one time then drove around and the other doors were locked as well :( so sad. Will go to del taco or jack in the box for breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"Easily the best TB in Madison (though with State St and University/Segoe closed, it's not much of a competition). Everything is made very well, very fresh, and very fast. Great service. The location rocks too right between 30 and Milwaukee. No complaints and this one is much less sketchy than the one on Park."}
{"text":"They do have great food, but I have had my order messed up several times or they don't put my full order in the bag. That's always dissapointing when you've already driven away.
I've also come in the evening hours (11pm ish)
and they were closed!!!  (They are supposed to be open until 1am or later) no notice on the doors or drive thru area. Nothing. 
And that has happened more than once."}
{"text":"Good place for tasty fast food although clearly not great for you. Service is usually fairly fast unless the drive through line is long. Good results at getting what I actually ordered in my to go bag so kudos on that for them. Cleanliness is just average could be kept up a little better."}
{"text":"They're very bad at it.

What you ask? 

Being a Taco Bell.

Slow, rude, dirty. You name it, this place has it all."}
{"text":"I've never been to a taco bell anywhere else in nc or the country that hasn't either grossed me out or made me sick after. Other than this one. Its right acrossed the street from my work so I visit often enough to make a review. The food is actualy freshand the staff is unbeliveable. So friendly and are willing to make any type of problem right. If i've had to wait more than 10 minutes for food, I alwasys get free food. (Usually tortilla chips or cinnamon twists). I would recomend yhis taco bell over amy other, espechially the taco bell/kfc right around the corner."}
{"text":"Ive never had this bad of an experience at this Taco Bell. It took approx. 30 minutes at the drive thru at 7:15pm on 04/21/2016. When we got home the burritos were flat and the tacos were a mess. This is totally unacceptable and I may never visit this Taco Bell again. Also, I tried to have lunch earlier on this day and the drive thru had approx. 8 cars so I went in and it was no better. It looked like 3 people were working the entire operation. Shame on the manager."}
{"text":"Well, Taco Bell is Taco Bell. The service here sucks. You have to remember to ask for hot sauce up front. If you don't you won't get any. If you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad. It's like you asked them to walk 5 miles to get some."}
{"text":"Love this location. Come here multiple times a week. Awesome staff and the food is always nicely prepared. Thanks and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ordered on the app, it took 30 minutes to get our food once we got there, and when the food came out, we didn't have our iced coffee. So we asked for it THREE different times to three different people and it still took 20 more minutes for it to come out. But when we got the iced coffee, it was in a hot coffee cup. We took the lid off, and there was hot coffee with very melted ice cubes. We asked why it wasn't iced and the cashier said it was! And then offered to add more ice. We asked for a cup for soda instead and he looked at us like we were from mars. On top of all that, during all of this, at one point the guy at the register reached over and started touching my hair without my consent. Worst Taco Bell experience in my life."}
{"text":"The service is ok, I usually go through the drive thru, always friendly. However, I live 15 miles away, but was the most convenient, and EVERYTIME I get home without checking the order, half of my order is wrong. I began to check my order before I leave and it's been helpful. But I shouldn't have to check their work. I am highly allergic to onions, I always order no onions, and they always put onions on my food, most of the time, it's looks like extra onions. Whenever I get tostadas (figure I would be safe with that), the beans are cold, not cooled off, but actually cold like they took them straight from the fridge. 
Long story short...I won't EVER go back to this location. I will drive the extra 5 to 10 miles to go to somewhere else. On average, I spend $20-30 every time I go, I'm feeding a family of 6. Their loss of my money...so sad!!!"}
{"text":"This is a Taco Bell alright.

I used to eat here every Sunday for a while when I lived in the dorms and the kitchen  was closed.  My standards were not terribly high, but I was never disappointed with the soft tacos or nachos.

I've been back a few times lately.  If you grew up eating Taco Bell, sometimes the craving comes back.

On this location:
The side door area kind of smells like urine but it is right next to the bathroom.  I've never used the drive through so I can't comment.

Going in the middle of the day on the weekend I have never had a problem.  The food is Taco Bell - you know what you are getting.  I am partial to the beefy crunch burrito right now.  It's a burrito!  With spicy Fritos on it!  There are days when that's what you want.

One time I had a very disorganized order, and the lady working the register organized it into value meals to save me some money.  I really appreciated that.

I usually get my food to go.  Last time they forgot one of the tacos, but when I mentioned it they immediately made it up for me.  Then I took 12 Fire sauce packets as usual and left to enjoy it."}
{"text":"a few minutes ago I went for the drive thru service and a lousy worker could not explain a question about my order and put what he felt like in my order I was so angry I Left."}
{"text":"I was with my son at the Riverview Park today and after getting a hot dog and a slushy. I was already on fast food mode and craved that crunchy taco. So we stopped inside this Taco Bell and i got my fix. But as we were leaving my son spilt his slushy . He starts crying so I told him it was no big deal. I asked the lady at the counter if I could borrow a mop to clean up the mess but she said she would take care of it, even after I insisted on cleaning it. Then I was surprised when  she offered my son a free slushy, I told her it was a slushy from some other place. She said it was ok! I didn't even know they had slushes! I offered to pay for it but the gal insisted it was on the house. My son was very thankfully and turned his frown upside down. Shout out to the crew in this taco bell location for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"We only come here when there's 6+ items we want to order and at least one of our items is wrong every time - either there's tomatoes when I said no tomatoes or there's a sauce missing or rice missing, etc. It's not a huge deal but it would be nice to get the whole order correct. Customer service is always fine."}
{"text":"Simple order. Nachos bell grande with no tomatoes and asked to substitute beef with beans. What did I get? A regular order of nachos bell grande. This was at 8:45 at night with no customers in drive- through or inside. Apparently this was a complicated order for them. Incompetence to say the least. How hard is your job anyways?"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell gets our order wrong 98% of the time.  The staff is usually rude and acts like it will kill them if they smile."}
{"text":"For taco bell standards, it was really good and fast. Got their breakfast for the first time, definately going back!"}
{"text":"The service is wonderful.  The manager is awesome.  He makes sure everything is going well and is perfect.  The food is incredible, and the remodel is glorious.
Go there."}
{"text":"Can't comment on food but one of the staff was not very nice!

On vacation here for the week and found this location on google maps while driving around with my 2 yr daughter this Sunday.  Decided to take a look if this location was open at 9am and pulled up to parking spot close to the front door and left my car running cause my daughter was in car seat.

This location opens at 10am on Sundays and I went back into my running car to try to find another location.  While sitting in my car trying to look for another location on my phone, I see a few of the staff from this location coming to work and one of them approaches my car.  This young white man tells me that I need to move my car and park in another parking lot.  WTF!!!  The lot was empty with only 2 other vehicles parked which were employees and they parked right behind me in another row.

I guess Taco Bell employees are also parking police.  Lol!"}
{"text":"We all know that Taco Bell is not the greatest food but it works in a pinch so I've gone to this location a couple times because it's the closest one to me but no more this one is the slowest fast food drive tro Ive ever been tro I will probably end up eating Taco Bell again sometime but it won't be for this location"}
{"text":"Service is always excellent! The staff of this place is the absolute friendliest I have EVER seen in a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"I rolled in at 1146 on a sunday night knowing they closed at midnight. Obviously close to being off of work, I still received great service. My favorite part was when I ask for handfulls of every sauce I ACTUALLY RECIEVED A WHOLE BAG O' SAUCE. IM ONE SATISFIED CUSTOMER."}
{"text":"Went to go through the drive thru at 9 on a Friday night and it was closed. Walked inside and waited for at least 25 minutes for 3 tacos. The cashier was on her phone almost the entire time while taking customer orders."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this location their always getting my food wrong. I ordered a Gordita chicken supreme and they over charged me with a Cheesy Gordita crunch. I went back inside and said politely that this wasn't not what I ordered. Along with 2 cheesy bean and rice burritos. They only had 3 crew memebers and 1 manager working at this location last night. The only thing that I like about this location is that it's close by my home in walking distance. They need to hire more people to this location. Stop messing up my orders sheesh ! They gave me the messed up order to keep which I appreciated though. That let's me know that customers can get away with almost anything."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I stopped eating here. Extra onion shouldn't go on top of the cheese of your crunchy taco. It goes on top of the beef."}
{"text":"Worst customer service i have ever had! If you enjoy a child screaming and yelling for 45 min while you try to eat your lunch then this is the place for you. Best of all is after asking not one not two but three employees to help aid in the situation and being ignored. The family decides to talk ill to me and mine. I finally had me and my family which includes a small child leave early. We where not even able to finish our lunch. Even better when i asked for the corporate office phone number not a single employee even acknowledged me. Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Melanie from the night shift is very friendly and fast :) we had late night munchies and needed nachos asap and she made it a fun experience."}
{"text":"We ordered a mini chicken quesadilla, beefy frito burrito, cravings deal box (cheesy gordida crunch, beefy supreme burrito, taco, and nachos), and a Pepsi. We waited in the drive thru line for 15 minutes before receiving our food. They never gave us our Pepsi and we waited a minute at the window but the woman never came back. The quesadilla had more on the outside than inside, the beefy frito burrito barely had anything in it, the supreme burrito only had beans and meat, the taco was broken, and the nachos came with a small side cup half filled with cheese. Very dissatisfied, and this is normal for this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Horrible service, long wait times inside, and inexcusable drive-thru wait times. There's absolutely no reason to wait 45 minutes in the drive-thru line that you can't even get out of so you're stuck there waiting whether you like it or not. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"i travel a lot and when i go to taco bell, i order the double decker.  in bullhead city and kingman  az. they have more stuff in them.  the franchise owner in las vegas will not offer ice tea b ut forces you to drink sugary fountain beverages

last week while in mesquite i went to a del taco and had their chicken burrito and had an ice tea.  it was excellent

so long taco bell until you get your act together and stop ruining a fine nation-wide product.

i called taco bell h q and got lip service 


so try del taco  much better quality and quantity for a buck more"}
{"text":"I dont eat at taco bell anymore.  But the dorito taco is awesome. Thats the only thing I will order from taco bell.   4 stars for the dorito taco. If not for that 1 star."}
{"text":"I just don't understand how this can always be so slow. Is there anyway that this can be fixed? It's been like this for as long as I can remember. Literally takes over 15 minutes to get through the drive through on a good night. 
This Taco Bell is notorious for being extremely slow at all times of day. You ask anyone who lives or works nearby about Taco Bell and they'll tell you it's not a good idea to go there if time is at all a factor because it takes so long. 
If you wanna go through the drive through be prepared to make a night/day out of it."}
{"text":"They have power outlets on the south and north wall maybe the east and west wall. 
By the windows lol."}
{"text":"This comment is for the manager Juan,, I have had some bad experiences at fast food but this is by far the worst. Juan you should have you job title stripped, you have terrible customer service, told me he did not have corporates number, and hung up the phone. I hope the right person sees this and fires Juan."}
{"text":"Came here on Nov 11 near midnight to get a quick meal for the family. One of the employees had to make an asshole comment complaining about us ordering too much food and being a fatass..
I'm sorry but look at your pathetic self? Working at Taco Bell + having a horrible attitude...  
I was just trying to get a quick snack for the  fam."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only late night fast food option in Waxhaw! Been here several times since it opened and it's has been consistent so far. Workers are nice, food is good, and inside is clean! Sometimes the drive though gets crowded, but they always get things moving in a reasonably timely manner."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.  If you really don't know about this place--then your problems are much bigger than anything this review will help you with."}
{"text":"This taco bell really sucks.  The customer service is not bad, the store is clean,  the problem is they're cheap.   They water down their sour cream to the consistency of water.  If you ask for a side of they're sauce,  like their baja sauce, they fill it less than a third full, and at 50 cents per side of sauce,  that's just plain a rip off!! Steer clear of this place,  God only knows what else they're skimping on. ..."}
{"text":"Love this location! It's newer and it's always very clean. Staff are friendly. They never mess our order up-and my family has a lot of special requests lol!"}
{"text":"Great staff! Always gets my order right. It's right across from the Air Force base so sometimes you get to see cool jets taking off. My kids love it. This is an older Taco Bell and I do wish they would update the inside a bit."}
{"text":"WARNING EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK! A year ago this is what my son found in his burrito,a small metal rod(see photos of business),only because he was gonna add extra sauce. This could have caused a life threatening situation and the manager was so nonchalant about it. Needles to say we have never ate here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, however I only give it two stars because I have now gotten soggy drive thru food from there that was so wet and it smelled kinda funny like it was wet with mop bucket water."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times, as we just live down the road, and have had few troubles other than them being a little slow. But, my wife and I took our boys there for a quick dinner, and my wife took our 5 year old twins to the rest room, as they came out I was waiting on our food and, she had a horrified look on her face. She told me, that there was a bloody needle in the toilet and blood on the floor in the restroom. We ask for a manger and a young guy came to us, she told him the issue quietly, not to cause a scene. He came back and said that he had \"fished it out,\" and we never seen him as much as use hand sanitizer. Obviously, at this point we were not going to eat the food, as we asked quietly for our money back, he had to go ask another manager, of whom we never met, she said \"it was too much food,\" they couldn't do that. It was a Grande meal, a $5 combo and 3 drinks. $22 tab, they couldn't handle that. So we got our food and had to throw it away."}
{"text":"This place is going to make me never vist another Taco Bell again.  Tye staff for the most part are friendly but the management is insincere and unprofessional at best. The food quality is so poor i have thrown it away on several occasions. I have complained about it before and their response was always a $5 credit towards more of the worst taco bell food ive ever had. I wish i good give a zero rating."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell and go to the location by my house a lot... But I will never go back to this location!!! This place was slow as hell. I ordered in the drive through and it took over 30 mins to get my food. Ok so It must be fresh they had to make it all from scratch... Nope. Not only was my order wrong, but my hard tacos were falling apart cause the juice had saturated the corn to the point it was decomposing. Then when I went in to correct the issue they told me \"that's just the way we make our tacos... Most people like when we put extra sauce on their tacos\" this entire experience  took an hour and 5 minutes just to get the food I ordered. I will never be back to this location. I don't know how it is still in business."}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food in the Pittsburgh area. Love Taco Bell food, but it really has a management problem. I would leave, but once ur in their drivethru ur stuck. I feel kidnapped-being held against my will!"}
{"text":"Like listen, your job isn't hard. Just follow what i ask for and stop giving me an incorrect order. Im sick of driving through twice to get things fixed here."}
{"text":"went there last night..Terrible customer service, employees yelling and carrying on. Got my order wrong then acted like I was bothering them to correct it. Guess adding lettuce to an Enchirito is a task. Horrible infestation of flies in dining room."}
{"text":"If you like cheesy, greasy, crunchy, hot American-style Mexican food you'll get it here. 

But the store management needs improvement. The place is run down and has barely gotten a facelift in the last 20 years (some broken chairs fixed this year). The staff need to do a better job at cleaning up and making the place presentable.

Food is usually done fine, but not always. Portions are average. Price is fine.

Waits are long, especially if you go into the store. Drivethru can be long too. They are understaffed and it can take time to even get served. Amount of customers has definitely gone down over the years probably because of service and the availability of more authentic Mexican food.

If you want a real Mexican meal, go to Burrito Boyz - preferably the one on lakeshore. I come to Taco Bell mainly because it's close by, affordable, satisfactory (you get what is advertised), and the fries supreme is unique. You can't get a fries supreme or a taco at too many places in Mississauga. But you can get better burritos and quesadillas."}
{"text":"Possibly the slowest Taco Bell Ever. Sitting in line at the drive thru for 20+ minutes now and still one car in front of me. (started with 4 cars when I pulled up!) the worst part is, the drive thru and parking lot are so narrow and limited, once you've gotten in line, there is absolutely no getting out or leaving the damn place."}
{"text":"Maybe I've just had worse experiences than the other 3 reviewers, but I feel like in the 4-5 times I've come to this location, the food is worse than average taco bell. I mean obviously the food is worse than average based on the fact that it's taco bell haha, but this location always seems to screw something up. Last time, my wife ordered a grilled stuffed burrito with chicken and there was no chicken + they added in fried potatoes... weird."}
{"text":"People who write reviews for Taco Bell are basically the definition of sub-human garbage."}
{"text":"I would usually put 5 stars but today I drove all the way home and they didn't give me fire sauce! I was mad, and so I went to another Taco Bell and they happily gave me my fire sauce. But the tacos from here were amazing :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular, so as I tripped through my order the very nice young man taking my order helped me figure out what I was trying to say (DBacks Supreme Deal, please!).  The gentleman that handed me my food had a huge smile on his face as he wished me a good evening. This kind of customer service from a fast food joint is unheard of anymore. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would never write a Taco Bell review... But when I went through the drive-through everybody here was so friendly. My order came out perfect, and I am pretty bratty when it comes to my Taco Bell. In the end, next time I want Taco Bell, I will definitely come to this one."}
{"text":"Taco bell advertises that they are open at 7am or earlier. However, this location cant ever seem to meet that standard. I and many others have driven away often due to nobody responding at drive thru untill 7:15. Good way to loose buisness !!"}
{"text":"This locations doesent value the safety of their customers. Begers are allowed to stand by drive through menu and run up on customers in their blind spot who are rolling down their window about to order. Drive through worker allows this to happen and if customers are upset about this you are told to leave and refuses to take order. Worst fast food experience I've ever had. I will never go to this taco bell again!!! Almost every time I've been to this location in the past they have been out of something, beans, beef etc... avoid this location unless you are looking to be ran up on in the drive through by people looking to beg or rob you. Their are better options out there save yourself the trouble, your safety is worth more then crap tacos...."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell ever. You have two people cooking and the rest are standing around doing nothing. The table that I sat at for 20 mins while I was waiting was filthy."}
{"text":"I dont understand how taco bell is still in business in AZ where there are hundreds of great mexican restaurants. Taco bell is garbage!"}
{"text":"One star is more than I could rate this exact location. I recently had surgery and had my husband stop and pick me up a taco salad because it was late and I need to take the pills with food. The drive thru was backed up to the street so my husband went into the restaurant so we can order it Togo. He ordered one taco salad and on the receipt it says 10:57- it is currently 12:12am and for one taco salad it still is not ready!? They stated that employees have quit today and there is two of them but instead of waiting on customers and getting food out- one of the two workers goes into the dining room to flip chairs let me mind you there is 12 other customers just trying to get their food to go as well. The drive thru hasn't moved but just sitting in line for a couple minutes then leaving for a new car to do the same exact thing. Both my husband and I have been in customer service our whole lives so he feels terrible leaving but this is ridiculous. The sad thing is this isn't the first time this has happened to us- it's been multiple occasions. If there isn't enough employees to keep your customers satisfied just close the doors and shut the business down."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Taco Bell's in the valley and unfortunately it's the closest one to my house. Anyway, I don't get the urge to eat there all that often but when I do, I dread going through the drive thru and interacting with the most incompetent worker who takes my order. I'd say it's 50/50, and that's being kind, if my order is correct. I know that it's bad management which has plagued this location for years. Do yourself a favor and go to the 35th and Peoria location, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great service and great employees.  Hard to find in the fast food businesses. Give it a definite thumbs up for taco bell."}
{"text":"No different than other TB's.

A-OK.

7 layer burrito, chili fries, oh ya."}
{"text":"Probably the friendliest fast food restaurant in this part of Gilbert.  Always friendly and nice.  Great customer service.

Food was always fast and fresh, BUT....they sometimes missed an item or made things wrong.  Be sure to check your food before you leave the drive through.  (That is why I gave a 4 instead of 5 stars.)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but it took 23 minutes to get a crunchwrap supreme and a burrito, when there were only 3 people in front of me and MAYBE 1-2 people in the drive-through. There were 3 people working in the food line, and there is absolutely no reason the order should have taken that long.

Also, the crunchwrap had hardly any meat and cheese, and was FILLED with sour cream in a corner. 

AVOID!"}
{"text":"Best taco bell ever!!! As a young man, fast food keeps me alive so I eat a lot of it. I have been to Taco Bells in about every state in America and many in other countries. I don't usually yelp about it. But his place was like a world class taco bell. 
I went in Monday May 8th about 1:30pm. Orders a very large take out order. The girl at the cashier was so sweet and kind. She was patient and precise.  
The order came out in like 4 minutes. I was shocked. The lady who brought it SHOCKINGLY (never has this happened to me before), she took the time to compare the food against the receipt in front of me to show me how everything was there. And it all was. The cashier was quick to get sauces and offer plenty of them. 
The food was all made correctly, great flavors and tasted better than normal. 

Best Taco Bell ever."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Taco Bell I have ever been to and I've been to a lot of them!
Our drinks only had 3 Sips in them (the rest was ice) and they put Little to No Meat at all on the Nachos, tacos and Chalupas. (1 of them literally had NONE!)
While we were there, there was an Escalade, with 4 people inside, parked taking up the entrance and blocking the Drive-Thru. 
They weren't ordering food, but instead conducting a Drug Deal in the Parking Lot!
If we go back we will stick to our local Indian Trail location."}
{"text":"HOPE THIS LOCATION SHUT DOWN AND SOMETHING BETTER OPENS.Last visit to this most horrible taco bell location. Both the food and service horrible  Not ONCE not TWICE but THREE times order issue. First time ordered food without beef but with chicken (guess what  we received all beef.) After few weeks went in ordred chulaps (several) ,flat bread was cold like its just taken out the refrigerator.  3rd time ordered food for 5 people came home,few items were MISSING and couple thing was without rice, they never wrote on the burrito wrap which one are without rice. We had open each burrito to check. This place out my list. I dont recommend anyone save ur money"}
{"text":"Today, 22 Oct 2014, I went to this Taco Bell to order one of the $1 cravings offered on this very web site, advertisement in the store window, and on the in store menu three days ago. Lo and behold to my huge surprise even though this web site advertises the $1 cravings as does the huge sign in the store window, but the in store menu has a pasted over price change of 30%. This is clearly false advertising. There were no napkins available or paper towels. To add insult to injury, the sewer gas smell emulating from the women's bathroom is over powering. This is a Champaign-Urbana Public Health Department infraction that ought to cause removal of the green placard from the venue window. Because of these disparities, I will no longer spend my money here. Do not go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible! This is the third time I tried this particular location. The third time I have left disappointed. I got a chicken burrito and it was the size of a rolled taco from Roberto's. I am not complaining about money here. I ordered the deal \"A\" which is a chicken burrito, drink and a bag of doritos. For the third time I got this burrito the size of a frozen taquito along side of a flat soda. Don't come to this location!"}
{"text":"If you are a big fan of slow service then this is the Taco Bell for you . I say that the average time of waiting is about 15 minutes and that is just for a burrito. And this isn't just an isolated slow time this is every single time I go to this Taco Bell. And don't think just because you go to the drive through that it be quick though the drive through is  super slow too.  Every time I go there I can be guaranteed that my wife says to me when I get home what took you so long? Also they suck at making your order right too. I had the stuff nacho griller thing the other day and it looked like a four-year-old had folded it up. Pay the extra couple bucks for Del Taco is my advice."}
{"text":"Love taco bell! It's my comfort food when I'm sad. My celebration food for when I get great news! Can't go wrong with some good taco bell."}
{"text":"Bad service,their attitude was worse then the service ...two different ppl keep takong my order so they got the order wrong..but who wonts to wait even longer for some food after you received your order wrong whats tge point of the read back...taco bell corporation would like the way this place give service now i cant eat at any yaco bell again receit was not given so cant contact the corporate with my complaint and she wouldnt reprint it for me"}
{"text":"Absolute pot head that dealt with us at the window.  He was so stoned he couldn't even figure out how to swipe my card and was laughing hysterically at himself.  While my 4 children uttered \"What is the skunky smell Dad?\" as his odor emanated out of the drive-thru window.  Mind you this was 10 am.  Suffice it to say, our smoothies were as advertised despite this."}
{"text":"Hey it's Taco Bell - what do you want?  I'm giving this three stars because it's A-Ok which is Yelp's rating system.

If you haven't been to a Taco Bell before then I don't know what to tell you - it's cheap imitation Mexican food with questionable quality ingredients.  It's not like you're going to take the pope here for a visit though, you're just getting some food.

The staff at this location are helpful and pleasant, and that's really all I ask for.  I don't come here often, but it's true to the Taco Bell brand."}
{"text":"Stop to grab a griller. Well after waiting 15 minutes for a $1 griller I need to be check into a psychiatric ward.  This place smells, the employees are rude.  The griller was OK. My friends food however, burnt potatoes, and fucky tasting nacho cheese.  Let's just say will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Slowest. Drive. Through. Ever. I could make an entire taco dinner from scratch in the amount of time it took us to receive one #3 with a Diet Pepsi. Good lord."}
{"text":"Tried to order three regular tacos and here was their response - \"we are out of beef for the next 15 minutes.\" What a joke. You will fail, Taco Bell, because of situations such as this - specifically this location."}
{"text":"Cheesy gordita crunch is where it's at! That and the double decker. And regular tacos. And fire sauce!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Greeted with a warm welcome. Ashley (cashier) was very enthusiastic."}
{"text":"These guys are always out of Something. We get burritos without cheese and many times we are told there is no beef or chicken.
Computers go down around 1am."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in the service we received tonight. We were innthe drive-thru for over 15 minutes and there were only 2 cars in front of us. I ordered 3 fresca style tacos and they completely gave us the wrong type of tacos, which of course I didn't realize until I was all the way home!  Never again!"}
{"text":"We came to dine in but after searching for a clean table and seeing all the mess and dirt we went to the car while my wife waited for the food. When we made our drinks the drink area was a complete mess. There were lids everywhere. There were no straws or napkins out. The cashier wasn't very warm at all. And the food took a really long time. There was no one else in there. When we finally got our food my daughter and I both had hair in our food. We took everything back."}
{"text":"I have only ever used the drive thru here, and it always a 20+ long minute experience. However, the employees are friendly and apologetic about the wait times. Food is always good, although sometimes items from my order are missing or I accidentally get a few things I didn't order in my bag. 
The new Baja Blast Freeze is really good!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Been seeing the ads for the \"Naked Chicken Chalupa.\" Wanted to try it. I haven't been to Taco Bell in a decade or more. Walked in on Saturday at 5:30 and there was a line of 8 or so, but I expected that. Unfortunately, as soon as I got past the door I was overcome with an overwhelming stench of raw sewer gas. Something obviously was working its way the wrong direction in the plumbing. I actually started to feel nauseous. Quickly calculated that the amount of time in line I would have to intake this noxious, putrid odor would poison me faster than the food would. Quickly exited. Maricopa County Health Department...Hey, when you have a chance, maybe you could wear some HazMat gear and check it out? Thanks."}
{"text":"OMG this is the best Taco Bell ever. I have been coming here for a few months. The drive thru is awesome.  Kelsy is the best. She is always bubbly and friendly.  I have never went to this location and had a bad experience. I even get happy faces on my receipt.  I feel so special when going there. .
I have been to other Taco bells and they don't even come close to the service you get here. I have went out of my way many times just to go to this Taco bell. I am definitely hooked."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this taco bell for over a year, and lately customer service is getting worse. Not only that, but the order is not always complete. I ordered 3 things of the menu, and when I got home, I realized that there was only 2 of them in the bag. I also wasn't aware that the ingredients in the bean burrito had change. If I would of known, I wouldn't have ordered them. Will think twice before coming to this taco bell again."}
{"text":"I just bought a nacho cheese chalupa like 3 days ago which is what I get everytime I go to taco bell and all of a sudden now they \"don't make them\" so I have to pay 75 cents more for the nacho cheese everytime I order it? How does that make any sense at all. They just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"The authentic Latin American cuisine is delectable. Try the loaded potatoe griller with steak. It is what the young folk call \"smack\".Newcomers beware. Its like having your taste buds accosted by the dishes array of flavors."}
{"text":"So I pull into the drive through at 6:35PM 1 car in front of me finishes ordering and I pull up I order the guy barely understood me but he finally got my order. I get to the window and asked him to confirm the order and he said we already did so i politely let him know I had a hard time understanding him (he was white Zach I think) so he finally does then I ask him why the line is moving so slow. Mind you my daughter is sitting in the front seat he starts cusing and saying that he works with a bunch of Fing idiots and crap like that and I tell him that I didn't appreciate his swearing and he's like Oh F you got kids in the car he closes the window. I go to the next window and I get another girl and I make a comment on how long I have been in line and shes like well I don't know hands me everything and walks away. I pull away from the drive through window at 6:50 PM Horrible service and most of the food was wrong order chicken gordita supreme got beef. Ordered soft tacco supreme not tomato all of them had tomato and they told me I had a huge order (5 soft taco supreme's, 2 chx gord sup, and burr box meal) I hate going to this Taco bell always have horrible service."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and waited 25+ minutes in line for 2 tacos. Horrific management. Other reviews coincide with the long drive thru wait time which means it wasn't a 1 time thing, you will most Likely experience  this \"fast\" food. My tacos were ice cold when I got them. So I waited for nothing (other reviews again agree with this sentiment their food was cold too. Check the KFC reviews this is also a KFC) Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Ordered two potato-ritos , WITHOUT sauce, and not only did they put it on there, it was a lot of sauce. It even says on the receipt NO Chipotle, AND the lady at the drive thru repeated my order even saying it. Really disappointed.."}
{"text":"I'm always down for Mexican food. Now, I can't say Taco Bell is real Mexican, especially coming out of the Mexican food plethora that is Arizona (offshoots of Filibertos? Or remnants of a society densely populated with Mexican migrants?)

But as far as Taco Bell goes, this is no better or worse than others in the area. Pretty standard in arenas of taste, cleanliness and staff."}
{"text":"Food is good, I mean its Taco Bell ! But the girls working here RUDE, I can't even enjoy my dinner in peace and quiet with my fiancé . They were being so loud and obnoxious, singing at the top of their lungs, screaming across the room to one another. Did you forget you had customers eating here???"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bellbut I'm fortunately the customer serviceis horribleand the employees are rude"}
{"text":"Maybe not the best place for food but whether you are drunk or hung over this spot does the job"}
{"text":"Always messing up my order. Why do I keep going? There isn't any other Taco Bell around and I stupidly keep thinking it'll be better next time. This is the third time we didn't get any napkins in our drive thru order. Is that weird to anyone else? Normally when I ask for sauce they give me 2 packets. So this time we asked for extra of hot and fire, got home, only fire in the bag. It's not even crowded most of the time when I go, but not only do they mess up your order, but they definitely don't care that your food is good, because if they did it'd be better. Nasty place. Obviously not everyone that works there is bad, but there are a few seriously bad attitudes there."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location said it was open until midnight but it was not. I showed up at 11:15 and all the lights were off but an employee was still inside ignoring the drive thru speaker."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst Taco Bell in Champaign-Urbana. Every time I come, the wait is well over 10 minutes, which would be fine if they actually got the order right. The lady I encountered tonight , didn't want to be here & made it very clear, rang in my order incorrectly.. after waiting 15 minutes I received the wrong food & had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the correct food to be made...FINALLY got the rest of our food and behold you IT WAS WRONG AGAIN. They don't care about their customers and I won't be returning to that location. Totally worth the extra 5 miles to a different location."}
{"text":"Fast and very friendly, which is uncommon  in this neighborhood. Not much to say about the food. When you're hungry and don't care about being healthy, it does the job."}
{"text":"Went here around 1pm for a late lunch and I decided to use the drive thru. While the line was 5 cars deep, I was hoping it was going to move quickly as it is \"fast food.\" I was wrong! I had to sit in line for literally 18 minutes. The food order was correct so no complaints there. Also, the way I ordered my items, the teller rang it up a different was which she said saved me some money-much appreciated!"}
{"text":"The drive thru at this place is the worst. I have been there three times and the first two times  the food was wrong when I got home. The third time I went through the drive thru they were doing construction inside, there was dirt flying every where and in the food, big boards hitting the computer screens and making dust fly, but they were still open and serving the food. We left and will not go back to that location again. Three strikes your out."}
{"text":"If I can give this place no stars I would! I went on my lunch break because I saw an advertisement that taco is doing a vegetarian awareness month. I got the power menu bowl with NO MEAT! Guess what I had in my freaking bowl...Chicken! Last time I checked Chicken is meat! Get a clue you people make 10.00 an hour don't put chicken in my food when a ask for NO MEAT!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here."}
{"text":"Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad."}
{"text":"Horrible service. If you go to this Taco Bell make sure you're not in a rush. I was stuck in the drive threw for 30 minutes before I got my food  and yet the employee forgot to give me my full order."}
{"text":"Okay, it took me a lot not to write a review about \"Taco Bell.\" Being that it's a fast food joint, my standards aren't crazy..just sensible! First off, drive thru was empty, and tell me why a small nacho fries and one Mexican pizza took about 8 minutes timed. Okay, maybe they were making the fries fresh? Nope, fries were stale and not one bit warm.  Next thing..I know that they're stingy with their hot sauce, which is why I specifically tell them how many I want, so they can't short me. Nope, wrong again. Even though I told her I wanted 8, attendant still gave me 3. Lastly, I just opened my Mexican pizza...NOT CUT. Seriously, you have one job! Speaking of job..maybe employees are just unhappy or maybe just untrained? because on another account while coming in at around 12am, I had one of the younger window attendants suggest I tip him? Too many characters here..do yourself a favor and avoid this location"}
{"text":"Usually it has become a fear entering a Taco Bell after poor ExperienceS at many locations in Columbia, SC and Georgia. However, this Taco Bell was great! We had ordered 1 Chalupa Supreme (was great), 3 DOUBLE Tostada (great), 1  Cheesy Gordita Crunch (great), 1 Apple Empanada (not sure) and 1 small drink. Lately, we have seen Taco Bell employees telling us that they do not warm Tostada  Shells again to make it nice and crunchy. So at other locations, it becomes chewy or just not crispy and its cold. But at this location, when we had Taco Shells/Tostada shell, it was nice and warm and crunchy. All toppings were generously done for all the items. Tables were clean. 
1 Chalupa - $2.99
3 Double Tostada - $5.07
1 Cheezy gordita Crunch - $2.99
1 Apple Empanada- $1.00
1 Small Drink- $1.59
Dined in Nov-22-2016
Great Food, Great Service!
Hope they keep it up!
Please give this location a try."}
{"text":"I went to this taco bell one day to get the D-Back's special, but they refused to change the crunchy tacos in to soft tacos.  All last year they did this so what makes this year any different?"}
{"text":"Went to get the D-back special, three of them to go for my family.  Taco Bell wouldnt do it this time, even though they did it every time last year.  Pretty much done with taco bell at this point."}
{"text":"Tacos here suck. The shell is always broken and I have found cut fingernails in the beef. Stay away don't need to be jumped by gang members here who spit their fingernail clippings into the food.  Be careful and can I take your order please?"}
{"text":"Apparently Angie controls the closing time. I know now that the sign says 1:00 am. She actually means 12:40. What makes it worse is that I called to ask if they we're still open at 12:40. The reply I received was \"my office computer says 1:02, we can't serve you.\" I wasn't looking for a big order. And no assistance! This place is garbage!!!"}
{"text":"I'm shocking myself by giving this place a good review.  I do like Taco Bell, even sometimes when sober.  I guess I appreciate the fact that I've never found anything disgusting in my food, and they always have those green salsa packets in stock.  Service is usually quick or I'm too wasted to remember how long it took.  The taco artists are nice too.  Props for not ever giving me the 'rheas for longer than 24 hours, thanks guys!

Edit.....  Uhhh, what the hell guys?!?  I order 2 food items, both with NO MEAT.  I get home, hungry, at 2am, and gleefully open my food items.  One of them is as ordered, but the other is slathered in GREASY GOD DAMN STEAMING MYSTERY MEAT.  Thanks for nothing, jerks!"}
{"text":"My order is ALWAYS wrong. This place never fails to make me hate going there. It took over 30 minutes just to get a single burrito. Then I asked for no sour cream, and once I got to the window I asked to make sure there wasn't sour cream. They weren't sure so they had to open my order. Which took even longer. Then apparently they put sour cream so instead of making another, they just scooped it out! Along with half of my burrito! I promise I will never return. This location is terrible!! DO NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Besides having to wait 10 minutes to place my order via drive thru, repeat my order 4 times & the lady having a huge attitude, I guess this Taco Bell location is okay. Two stars mostly because the lady's attitude sucked & having to repeat what I wanted so many times made me cut my order short just to avoid the hassle of ordering additional items (or trying to) with this overwhelmingly joyful employee."}
{"text":"moved to new location in food court.  I payed $2 more today than I did the last time I was there approximately three weeks ago.  Poor quality meat in what I ordered.  Staff unpleasant.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I usually only post negative reviews, but our last trip to this location was outstanding from a service perspective.  The cashier was very helpful in making sure my daughter's quesadilla did not have the spicy sauce as requested, then came by the table after we started eating to ask if we needed hot sauce or a drink refill.  Oh yeah...and our order was right for the third visit in a row!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I have to do in order to leave this review.. I have been coming to the Taco Bell since it was open and I used to love it and it's right up the street from me I've lived here 25 years (my whole life) and I hate this place now I am standing in their parking lot 2 AM ...been here for a while now got a flat tire turning in their drive-through we pulled to the side-into the parking lot to try to fix the tire, told them about our tire getting popped as we were pulling in and then wouldn't serve us food,--which I expected; but what I didn't expect: was for them to turn the lights off in the parking lot and leave us to do this in the pitch  Black night with no light! (Immediately after we told them about the situation) and honestly, I expected, maybe, a comment of, \"sorry that happened to you\" they were rude and have been rude as we 
are still standing here trying to fix this tire. 

**Honestly, I was grossed out when I saw the guy with his hands in his butt crack a year ago I'm not sure if it was at this location but now honestly I wouldn't be surprised!

***and in addition, as I'm finishing writing this review, just now,a bit past 3 AM(3 hrs+ later) two employees came out and got in their car didn't say a word to us and then drove away, what great gratitude!? Oh such outstanding employment... ha 

Me, and my elderly mother.. females, in the middle of the night in a pitch black parking lot just trying to get a burrito on our way home!"}
{"text":"Daytime service rocks. Never open after midnight lately, at least put up a sign so Im not sitting in the drive thru  for an hour looking lame!"}
{"text":"Its taco bell need I say more..
However they got new sauces now
Verde somthing sauce
Rosted pepper sauce
Not bad"}
{"text":"worst service ever, waited for 30 mins for the chicken because the girl on the speaker said they will check if they still have chicken left, hello!! at 6pm and its not closing time yet, you will check if you have chicken. and your flag ship is chicken, hmm. I think it should be kentucky No chicken (KNC) instead of KFC. did their survey online and left a number to call me back, but no reply til now. definitely not suggesting this one."}
{"text":"Just went through drive thru and orded food... i tried to make sure everything was right the manager assured me it was but when i got home it wasnt.  Not only was he rude when i was there but was on the phone when i called about it."}
{"text":"Just had the saddest excuse for a burrito here. Chipotle Ranch Grilled Chicken Burrito, tasted okay but mostly all tortilla, hardly any filling."}
{"text":"This is the most amazingly slow drive through ever!!! Just 4 cars ahead of me and it took 1/2 hour!!! Never, ever go here. Ever!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the lady kept repeating the wrong order back. It's not even busy and she kept talking so quickly, and gave us a completely different order. After we went in she said she didn't hear that at all. I've been ordering food for years and I have never had this issue. Smh"}
{"text":"Outdated look, slow service, half star for gud customer service... I think ud get ur food faster going thru drive thru, which ill happily take next time I come here :)"}
{"text":"The cashier was very polite & professional and my food was given to me fast & hot!.... The manager spoke to us all greeting us with a smile excellent staff!"}
{"text":"Do human beings actually eat this garbage?
I used to have a co-worker that ate here five days a week and even he called it \"Toxic Hell\"
I first discovered Taco Bell in Phoenix Arizona in like, 1968 (I know, I'm a fossil). 
Taco Bell back then only existed in South Western states. 
Believe or don't, back then it was like ten tacos for $2, And they were pretty decent.
My ex-wife and I used to go to Taco Bell about once a month back in the 80's and get burritos-they were ok, but definitely \"junk food\".
Then in the 90's my son's friend worked there and he swore the beef was delivered freeze-dried and had to be heated and rehydrated before it could be served.
Last year (2014), after being assaulted with Taco Bell TV ads for years I decided, what the hell, try it again, give it a fair chance.
I ordered a simple taco-had to spit it out-I wouldn't feed that to a dog! Yuck!

P.S. Statistics prove that the most likely place to get a drunk driving arrest (in this area anyway) is within a 100 yards of a Taco Bell around 2 am...cops know where party people go after the bars close....don't believe me? Google it."}
{"text":"They are always so nice here. The drive thru seems to take a while which seems to be do to under staffing but the stress of this type of situation never shows on the employees. I always prepare myself for a bad attitude but never get one. I don't know why it surprises me everytime but I love it. I will wait as long as you need if you do it with a smile. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"I used to be impressed by this location because they rarely forgot items. They've forgotten items in my last 3 orders. Unforgivable."}
{"text":"Sad to see from other Yelpers that this Taco Bell location has not changed in 2 years.

My wife and I went to this Taco Bell/KFC location for the first and last time today. We ordered six taco supremes and waited forever for our food. As I was waiting a long time for our food, I noticed that the 4 or so employees behind the counter were just standing around, chatting, and not working. The only food that was coming out was for the drive thru, still very slow.

Our tacos order was finally ready. When we got our tacos they were terrible. They looked like they had been thrown together very fast with no thought to the final product. As you can see in the photo, they were very bad.

I went back up to the front counter to be met with the same employee that took our order. He asked if I needed help. I asked to see the manager. He then left the counter. Another very young employee came up. Her name said \"Team Member.\" She asked if she could help me. I asked if she was the manager and she said, \"I basically am.\" I said is there a manager here? She said she was working Taco Bell. I stated that if she was too busy then I wanted the store managers number. She then walked away.

Another girl came walking up. She saw me and walked into the office. Then again popped back out didn't look at me until she was at the counter and asked if she could help me. I said that I used to work at Taco Bell and I know that this is not what a taco supreme looks like. She asked if I wanted other tacos. I didn't want any. I asked if I could get some chicken instead. She said yes.

I ended up getting 4 very hot pieces of chicken instead. Even though the chicken was hot, the chicken was not very good; very, very greasy and also tasted like the oil they are frying the chicken in is old.

Whoever is the manager of this Taco Bell needs to be let go. Very poorly run restaurant. Will never visit again. Terrible customer experience. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell around.  Great and quick service with very friendly staff they keep them place clean too"}
{"text":"Well I didn't get sick and die, that counts for something these days!"}
{"text":"This location has poor service! My kids and I stood in there for about 10mins and no one came to take our order! The employees saw us standing there and no one asked if we needed anything! I will never go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Alright. I don't eat taco bell, and wouldn't still even if I weren't allergic to dairy. That being said, my boyfriend and I just left this place and had to see if anyone else mentioned the gung-ho middle aged guy working there named Matt. He was the most intense guy ever to work in fast food. Basically a commercial come to life. I wasn't sure what to think or whether he was trolling, but it was the most interesting experience at a taco bell I've had. Totally a nice guy."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Service, intelligence level, and food. Save yourself a headache and for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Those guys that work the drive thru are so amazing! Fast quick and super friendly!! And th food is always fresh keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Taco bell Markville mall is the best! Been to Fairview, Scarborough town, Etc and none are as fresh as this location. Consistent, fast, friendly, and fresh! 

Typically order the steak or beef supreme tacos with fries supreme and drink. Pop is always fizzy"}
{"text":"This is only Taco Bell after the one on vine st closed down close to my area, chalupas are the only thing I would visit taco bell."}
{"text":"This location is across the street from where I live, so I've been going only to this location for about 2 and a half years. A year ago, I would have given this location 1 star, but they have REALLY improved on everything. The food, obviously, is the same as all the other stores, but here they seem to give larger portions now. Rarely dine in, but the people working the drive thru are so incredibly friendly! A lot of them recognize me and carry on a short conversation, other than the \"do you want sauce\" question. Tortillas are almost always soft and fresh. I'm moving this month and that Taco Bell better live up to the standards this one has set. :)"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Ordered drive thru 15 min at the window.  Got home. 6 min drive, and all tacos were cold. Called and phone is fax line. Worse the screwed up the order.....is watched him pack a box then unpack the box, pack another box then repack the first box."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Please do yourself a favor and go to chipotle, penn station, or five guys if you're hungry and in the steelyard commons area. I normally love Taco Bell and don't care about the quality of the service, but even I couldn't get over how bad this place was. The workers are extremely rude and they take FOREVER to get you your food. In the drive thru, it took over a half hour with only 4 cars and barely any more customers inside. Then the cashier didn't even have the decency to say anything or look at me. He just put his hand out for my money while laughing with his coworkers, then handed me my food again without looking at me or saying anything to me. I don't ever write reviews for fast food because I figure they all are about the same and you shouldn't expect much, but this Taco Bell set the bar for the absolute worst service. On top of a ridiculous wait and rude service, when I finally got to eat my food it was cold and very poorly made. My loaded potato grilled had rock hard potatoes, gross bacon and barely any sour cream or cheese. It was so dry it was almost inedible. My frito burrito wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't as good as most that I've had. 

To sum it all up, an extremely long wait, rude service, and cold and poorly made food all motivated me to write this review to try and save someone from wasting their time and money at this establishment. Please take my advice and avoid this Taco Bell like the plague!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a zero I would I just left at 9:45 ..04-27-15  I told the girl my son was allergic to cheese 3 times and still put cheese on my son's  tacos I ask her at the window if the tacos had cheese on it she smack her lips and said nooooooo...there rude there if u want some one to get a allergic reaction and die just go to this taco bell ....there serve the taco rite should of got a burger ...."}
{"text":"Some times you have to eat fast food, right now our family is in this situation. 

We have a family member having serious health issues and are taking turns being there for him. I can't remember the last meal that we've been able to make at home. 

So... This means that we have sampled every fast food place along Rt. 50 from Heidelberg through Bridgeville at least once. This is the best of them.

As another reviewer commented, this is Taco Bell. You will not get fine dining here, but they make the menu items quickly and correctly with a smile. THAT is what I want from fast food and they have it figured out.

Usually I hit the drive in and go. It looks like a Taco Bell, a clean Taco Bell. What first impressed me is that no matter when you go there or who is working the window you get polite service. In fact you actually get service with a smile. Every single server has been the same way over several weeks and several shifts. There is something unusual and very right about this. The manager must have figured out how to treat and motivate his staff. 

Today we had a particularly rough day in the family as we had to transfer our family member into hospice. I had been up most of 48 hours and was totally used up. I stopped in this Taco Bell on the way home for a late lunch. I decided to go in see how their service was inside.

My first impression was that is was sparkling clean. I mean it was clean enough to film a Taco Bell commercial here. This is a good sign. A staff member that I've never run across at the drive-up window waited on me. I received the same service with a smile from her that I always get at the window. I started pouring my drink and my meal was ready. Yes, it was that fast. Another new face gave me my meal, again with a smile. 

I ordered the number five combo, nachos, a taco and a drink. It was made right and served super fast. I sat down and looked around, there was nothing out of place. When there was a break in the action the young lady who served me grabbed a broom and swept up. (This explains why the place is so clean.) I noticed that every patron was getting the same fast, courteous service. (It must be a conspiracy!) On the way out I grabbed a napkin and noticed that they had wet-naps and mints at the condiment station. That was a nice touch.

Whoever is managing this location has it figured out."}
{"text":"Always friendly and cheerful, and great food of course. And they never fail to brighten my day when I stop by - thank you Taco Bell !"}
{"text":"RAW CHICKEN
Forget the rude drive through attendant who handed me the food without any acknowledgement, they served my wife completely 100% raw chicken in their Big Crunch sandwich. Not lightly cooked, not medium rare, but with the exception of the the thin breaded exterior, completely and utterly raw.  I feel that I can't say RAW CHICKEN enough. 

Even worse is that my wife, exhausted from taking care of our infant, ate half before I noticed and stopped her.  Given that it's a day before Christmas and she couldn't induce vomiting, we're crossing our fingers.

This place has always been badly managed and disgusting but they reached a low that should have them shut down.  I'll be getting my occasional Taco Bell elsewhere if ever at this point."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THE DRIVE THRU!! Went here at 8:00 pm on a Wednesday, two cars in front of me and I sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes. EXTREMELY SLOW!!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. Can't really mess it up but can make not better. The manager at this location is awesome. Big dude with a rock on mustach. Out going and kind and just a good man. Really don't find these kinda people at a Taco Bell. Plus the Taco Bell was well made and good eats."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill the past few months.  The employees are very nice, yes, but I'd rather take someone with attitude over my orders taking forever and being incorrect.  Typical time is at least 5 mins a car in the drive through.  Ask for extra sauce, and get none on more than one occasion.  Even something as simple as a soda they somehow manage to mess up - today it tastes like soap. Maybe if they hire people who can actually work instead of making stupid voices orders will start being right again"}
{"text":"My got my food in a timely manner and it tasted pretty good. Will be going back if I am in a hurry."}
{"text":"General manager dropped my food on the floor from the drive-thru, and gave it to me even after she dropped it, like if no one saw it. I watched her have her staff rewrap everything that was just on the floor and hand it to me in less than 30 seconds. The general manager argued with me insisting she never dropped the food when I (and her staff) sat there and watch it all happen. So gross! If the general manager is willing to give a paying customer food that fell on the floor, just imagine how unsanitary they are and low food standards they keep.. gross. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"The tables were dirty. The food was exactly what you would expect. It is an hour after my meal and no tummy gurgles yet. Whew!"}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to go in a pinch for a quick lunch. 
But the service has really gone down hill.
If you go through the drive thru .. DO NOT EXPECT to get packets of sauce even when you ask for them. 
Also don't expect your drink occasionally because they think they gave it to you.
The food is good.. 
But the service really has taken a turn for the worse here.
I hope they get it together soon."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. I ordered the $5 nacho fries box. My son got the $5 cravings deal. My Gordita crunch was on a chalupa and had only beans, lettuce, and cheese and no crunchy taco. We took it up to the counter and requested a new one. There's an older lady here who said it had meat on it. \"We put only 1.5 ounces on there. Take it back and eat it.\"  Excuse me?  Where's your customer service?  They make me a new one. Here's what I got instead. I also got nacho fries in my box. It came with, no joke, 10 fries of different sizes. 10.  What a joke. The bathrooms are also filthy and full of trash. I would stay far away from here for dine-in service."}
{"text":"Heading into hone depot and hungry.  I was lured into the taco bell drive thru after seeing signs on their window advertising the new chicken biscuit taco.  Sounded good. I try to order and chick in drive thru has no idea...she then tells me there is no such item. I leave drive thru thinking I must have been seeing things....but NO I wasnt....I see the sign again and this time I called.   Girl answers and says it's only served for breakfast.  Signs do NOT say that.  What a waste of my time."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Taco Bell. They are always friendly and the one time they forget something they ended up giving us a extra dessert no charge! Ps inside is also clean majority of the time too!"}
{"text":"Seriously, save your money and go somewhere else. 
I know its just KFC / Taco Bell, but they too should have at least a minimum satisfaction standard. Yep, every single time we have had the misfortune of stopping here, while attempting to get something edible, we have been so incredibly disappointed. 

Grease alley (The Queensway) has a whole stretch of fast food places that are better, cheaper and faster than this. The hot dog stand at the Canadian Tire across the parking lot is a safer bet. Oh, and don't bother complaining... pretty sure our e-mails and voice mails were sent to the Bermuda triangle."}
{"text":"I've gone thru their drive thru probably 8-9 times. Every time they get my order wrong. I have to remind them that I ordered a drink, and I need some hot sauce. Everytime."}
{"text":"good food, timely manner excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This by far is the best place to go as far as I am concerned. Been to others. None compare with this place. The professionalism, attitude, cleanest place, care and paientience towards customers and just overall best place to go if choosing one to go to. Should you visit, you will see what trying to express to others. The speed orders are made. Again others (other taco bell  stores) need to learn from how this place operates. Busy or not, it's the same as far as how your treated and the apearance of the place. Fully recommend this place. One thing love about this place is yes menu does change which is normal, new items or offers come out. Yet the offers for older / previous items are still there and some are  still present meaning advertised on the menu still. A big KUDOS to this store. Again, as trying to be straight forward with anyone. Highly recommend this place if your interested. Very many thumbs up or if like; as many stars as can give and more."}
{"text":"Not the best Taco Bell I've been so, service wasn't the best I felt judged by the cashier by what I was Ordering and that was not cool!"}
{"text":"This location is extremely slow. It seems like the drive through takes precedence over the dining room. We waited twenty minutes for \"fast\" food. If I intend to come back, I will remember that the drive through is faster. Quality and taste of food is adequate to corporate Taco Bell standards. Doesn't seem like the staff moves quicker, even when customers bring up how slow they are in regards to service. Team member discussing service with customer behind me right now....location doesn't have enough staff? Hire some more!"}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bell goes, this is one of the best. It is a very heavy traffic area, so I believe that keeps the food fresh at all times."}
{"text":"We asked for cheesy potatoes 39 times(not literally) and just got completely ignored. What's up with that? Js"}
{"text":"On a lighter note I have to give it up for my favorite fast food. This is as cheap as food gets, but I love it, and probably have ate here once a week for the past 15 years. When I was unemployed I literally survived on bean burritos, soft tacos, and hot sauce.  I believe If every country had a decent method of distribution, Taco Bell would solve world hunger.

As far as this location its open late, built for drive thru, and looks old school."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is trash. The workers are way over the top with customer service, I mean like when they are way to peppy and it's annoying. I ordered my gordito box a certain way as in allergic to certain things like lettuce. It seemed as is they just put extra lettuce on everything. Spend the money somewhere else or go to a different location."}
{"text":"just had the worst service ever waited 20 minutes for 2 tacos then ask Alicia the manger how much longer and she told me she can't tell that \"really\" so i asked for my money back and she  thew it at me with no apologize"}
{"text":"Not that Taco Bell would normally be considered a Four Star restaurant ~ however when rating Taco Bell's to each others. . .this location is very good. It's in a great location so it's quite busy yet its always very well maintained ~ doesn't seem to have a lot of turn over ~ very well trained friendly staff. The menu is always changing ~ nice variety ~ always fresh. 

It's a blessing to have a inexpensive clean place to grab a bite to eat.   Love that Taco Bell has gotten on the healthy food option train.  It's good . . .and getting better. 

Blessings
:)

{"text":"Definitely a convenient location since it's literally one block from my house. Haven't really stopped because I don't eat fast food. However, when I did stop I was pleasantly surprised. Very friendly drive thru cashier.  She was SO polite and courteous which can be hard to do at 2 AM. My food was done very quickly and was hot. I appreciate the pleasant experience and I will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had to go to the car to change my daughters diaper because they don't have a diaper changer in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. No boxes for there 5buck box deal. No chips either. No sauce. No napkins. No common sense and food was awful..."}
{"text":"What can you say about Taco Bell other than fresh and still reasonably affordable. Consistently quality food. Wish there were more around to be honest...:)"}
{"text":"Stopped at Taco Bell on 67+Peoria .Had a \"Orange Cream Pop\"Freeze. so yummy..And customer service was great,place clean"}
{"text":"It's your average Taco Bell.  The location is convenient for work and price is affordable for an inexpensive lunch.  Great service and the food tasted really good."}
{"text":"Every time my family gets food from here it always tastes funky, like theyre trying to change the recipe, and theyve forgotten a few of our items multiple times at the drive through. We now drive to the next Taco Bell over."}
{"text":"they literally mess my order up every time im here. i dont know why i keep having faith in them. how hard is it to make a fucking burrito with no onion in it. why should youre service be so bad that i have to unwrap my burrito to check it before it eat it."}
{"text":"Our first day arriving in Las Vegas we go to this Taco Bell and it's like 1 something in the morning so they have 24-hour drive-thru. We ordered a grande meal and a steak burrito for our family and the person at the window kept on telling us that there was no ground beef so we ask him to make tacos with chicken instead, hard tacos. 
The cashier said yes he gives us our total and they charged us 3 dollars more because because we wanted chicken. We pulled forward and I proceeded to ask him why are we getting charged $3 extra, it wasn't our fault they ran out of beef. But yet we want the deal to save money. He was a Rude man who said he couldn't do anything about it and it was store policy and that's the way it is.
I come to vegas to see my Grandchildren and my son and daughter in law. This city has the worse customer services I have ever seen or been apart of."}
{"text":"First, I'll admit I'm a die-hard Taco Bell fan... but beyond that, I've always gotten great service from this location. They're always nice to me in the drive-thru and their service is usually quite fast. I recommend it all the time."}
{"text":"Sucks made me come back 3 times and forgot my hard taco I was dreaming about the whole day for I hate this place"}
{"text":"I know this will not really make a difference as it is a fast food place and no one will contact me. This is probably by far the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. 99% of the time my order is incorrect. There is a difference between beef and chicken right? No one seems to care when you call in and make mention that the order was not correct. You get treated like you did something wrong. Will probably be the last time that I have taco bell..."}
{"text":"Best taco bell portion wise. Taco bell is one of the most inconsistent places to eat from location to location but after eating at this one the entire time I've lived in the area, other taco bell locations seem to disappoint in comparison. (except the one near mentor mall) my husband is addicted to Taco Bell so he eats it weekly and is sad we are moving so far away from this location as he's come to be known as the Lava Sauce Guy by the staff there and never has an incorrect order."}
{"text":"First and foremost I came in about five minutes before closing time, inside the store. The minute I walked in, I already felt a nice comfortable vibe. And sure enough, the workers were really friendly, made me feel more comfortable. Whatever they are doing, keep it up night crew. Because I dig that positive vibe. Made me feel like family. Definitely coming at this location for now on. Thank you guys again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst horse shit Taco Bell I've ever been to.  I've never met such brain dead retards behind my life.  To the ass hat at the window.  You fucked my order up, you gave me two drinks with just carbonated water (I ordered a fucking coke), and one of the damn kids wasn't even on the cup.  Burn.  Burn in hell.  

Also ordered a big box.  But wait, it came in a bag.  WHERE THE FUCK IS MY BIG BOX.  Notice the word BOX.  BOX.  Not bag.  

Lastly.  Eat a dick.  Every.  Last.  One.  Of.  You."}
{"text":"always get my order wrong, never apologize when we mention it, manager NEVER ANSWERS or returns phone calls! hire some americans that can read english and the order, and maybe the order would not end up being wrong!"}
{"text":"Slow, dirty inside, employees are cussing to each other. At least the food was good but experience not so much."}
{"text":"I've now been waiting for food for over 20 minutes.  I used to work at two different Taco Bell locations years ago and this is just gross incompetence.  On a prior visit to the drive-thru (also horrendously slow), my cheesy Gordita crunch was missing the other half...like the part that makes it a cheesy Gordita crunch.  Gross incompetence again.  This place is an embarrassment and thanks to waiting 23 minutes, I had time to write this review!"}
{"text":"The lines are long at this one. They also stingy with the sauce packages. But they generally get my order right."}
{"text":"Love Taco Bell!! However the location has  horrible customer service and down right rude employees. I would suggest management supervise and train better on how to positively deal with guests"}
{"text":"Taco Bell's food is basically the same at every location. So the difference of course is the service. Last night I literally waited over half an hour (I timed it: 32 minutes) for the food I ordered, which was just the featured \"5 dollar box\" on the menu. There was no apology for the wait, no explanation, no nothing. I heard an employee say to someone else that they were just \"so swamped,\" but literally when I arrived there were 2 cars in the drive-thru and 3 tables with people eating inside... otherwise a ghost town. OVER HALF AN HOUR? For fast food tacos? Nope. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is always good. The service is outstanding! The wait time is lousy. It could be morning,  noon or night, busy or not...always have to wait to where it is a noticeably longer time..."}
{"text":"Standard tacobell everything was warm and tasted like it should. Was quick also, and the soda had the mix right."}
{"text":"The saying \"wash your veggies before you eat them\" takes on a whole new meaning for me today.  The lettuce in my taco tasted like dish water! The taste was an instant turn off. 
I no longer go in to eat as the overwhelming smell of bad meat hits you as you walk in the door!  
The beans on the nachos reminds me of mud and tastes about the same. 
Truly a fast food place with increasingly nasty food every time I go."}
{"text":"The tacos are good.  Pay attention if you use the drive through.  The person at the window might short change you.  Our $7.88 order had  a $20 offered as payment.  The person at the window quickly gave me $10.12 not $12.12 and they turned away from me.  When I brought it to their attention, they did not seem surprised and I got the other $2.  I think the manager should know about this."}
{"text":"This place needs to be condemned! Ate there yesterday and just got out of the hospital with food poisoning. If you enjoy sitting on the toilet for 24 hrs straight feeling like you drank a bottle of acid than go ahead and eat at this dump."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, but I had a bad experience this weekend at this location. I ordered 3 soft tacos with sour cream and my boyfriend ordered the steak burrito. The food came out fast and when we sat down to eat both of our orders were wrong (which is not a big deal) the cashier(young guy) was new and mistakes happen. My boyfriend didn't care that he got a beefy burrito instead and all my order was missing was the sour cream. I went to the counter to ask for sour cream and the lady had an attitude and said, \" well what do you want me to do remake them or just give you a side?\" I got the side and sat and ate, but I was pretty upset about the way she reprimanded the new cashier and gave me attitude. Just apologize and fix it."}
{"text":"This was awful. Got to the window  after 25 min and sat there for another 5. I wasted my whole lunch here 
Very dissapointed and still hungry"}
{"text":"I am in utter shock at how awful this location is! Ordered a cheesy Gordita crunch and this is what we received. Not only that but we ordered 2 other crunchy taco supremes and they were just as bad aka empty! This is so terrible! Do not go to this location!
How is this even remotely acceptable!"}
{"text":"Ask I take a bite of my Succulent, crispy, tender chicken quesadilla with a side of what I thought to be 24 karat gold nacho cheese; I'm am suddenly takin back to when I was a child. When my grandmother would make fresh tortillas and cheese from the cattle they've bought from old Francis down the street right next to the shoe string factory. Every bite taking me further and further to the edge of Ecstasy. My visit here today has changed my life, from the old cold play soundtrack to the small tables and chairs that presents a home feel .like your in a coffee shop in a snuggy sipping on grande extra hot soy latte with micro foam. Excellence....... the co2 wasn't carbonated very well. 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is nasty ass hell!!! First of all the place is ran by teenagers.. So I goes in there on 2/4/2018 around 9pm, the place is empty there's no one in line but me, all I ordered was 4 soft tacos with light lettuce that it!!! The actual time was 9:32pm.. I didn't receive my food until 9:56pm.. this kid comes to the front counter and apologize to me and told me to come in tomorrow and my order would be free... I only eat Taco Bell like once a year so I'm not going back in 2018.."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews on yelp, but this place got me so furious today. Bought some breadsticks today to-go, went home and found out they looked like they been sitting out all day, all dried out and flat. So I drove back to have them exchange it, the manager on duty (Thursday 6:40pm, July 16, 2015) told me all the breadsticks look all flat like that. I told the manager if they all look like that than I want my refund. She didn't put an effort to handle the situation. Very poor customer service. And if all the breadsticks look like that I think corporate needs to re evaluate on the presentation of their Pizza Hut food. This Pizza Hut/taco bell locations gets a fat L"}
{"text":"Really??? Is some extra lettuce and a little bit more cheese going to kill your bottom line? Next time headed to Del Taco- 3x the cheese."}
{"text":"I went to burger king and just wanted nachos n cheese.  They were rancid....years of restaurant experience tell me old oil. The person serving them should have known by the smell that they are nasty."}
{"text":"Great service. Ask for Dasia. She's the greatest! She absolutely made sure our order was perfect."}
{"text":"I know you aren't expecting much from your Taco Bell however, I did call them with a concern (I'm vegetarian) the gentleman on the phone went over all the ingredients with me on the phone. Something I didn't ask for but he was willing to go the \"xtra\" step. Thank you! People are so quick to leave negative feedback! I challenge you to express the good as well! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location has consistently provided great and accurate service. Darlene is the friendliest employee and makes sure your order is correct."}
{"text":"Food was good, service and food wait slow, but will say this they were friendly and tried to accommodate me as best they could."}
{"text":"This review is for this one experience only. I other trips there have been better. This trip was a long wait in drive thru, all the food was cold, had to go in for part of the order they didn't give me, and 7 layer burrito had no meat what so ever"}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell out there because of there great service. The counter lady had a smile on her face all the time and she knows how to make you laugh. The cook would make my super fast...I barely walked away from the cashier and it was already ready.  Also, they try there best to keep this place sipic and span. I recommend this Taco Bell compared to the other Taco Bells out there."}
{"text":"They never get your order right. They need a better training program.  I guess you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"One of the better Taco Bell's I've been too. Just had the taco salad and it was great. The staff is always so friendly and that sweet tea is amazing."}
{"text":"I literally downloaded the yelp app to make this review. I see all these 1 star reviews and got to speak up myself. I'm a pilot out of Mcarren airport down the street and I'm always getting off work after everything else is closed (even other Taco Bell locations) but not this one. I often roll up at 1-2am after a long day and starving. Although they only have one person running the store this late the service is always fast and my food has always been hot and fresh tasting. Not only that but the employees have always been exceptionally happy for that late at night. Been going here weekly for the last 3 years and i have not had a bad experience yet. And I'm sure il be back in the middle of the night in the future."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Taco Bell religiously for the last 8 years (mostly for the Mountain Dew) but this one is by far the best! It is always clean and the food usually comes out before you even fill your drink! They don't skimp on filling the tacos and burritos (a lot of taco bells do) which is always good. I'm not a fan of the new red Mountain Dew but the baja blast is very good. As with all franchises some are better than others and this location is by far the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Got my cheese roll up from the women who's hands ware in soap till elbows. Had to throw it away. January 9th 12:20 am (ish). I hoped to get food from clean (and not soapy) hands. (Don't you need to wear gloves even). Wow. I would of waited if she would of washed her hands."}
{"text":"It's odd ro give a simple taco place 5 stars but this place deserves it.  I was pleasently \"suprised\" to find a Taco Bell that was so wonderfully clean to start with. The Asst. Mngr. took our order and was very polite a neatly groomed (a rare find at most TB's I've been to)  The tables were squeaky clean as was every part of the store. Our food was good and they portioned well so our tacos and tostado were not skimpy. I actually was full from my tostado as it had a hearty helping of beans YES!  I visited the ladies room when I got there and just before I left and they had actually cleaned it every 30 mins at stated on their restroom chart.  The proof of a VERY clean restaurant. The drive-thru was full but the employees looked like they were getting the orders out and nobody was just standing around chatting.  I gotta say it was such a nice change from what I would have expected."}
{"text":"Not pleased with the abrupt stopping of senior drinks...not going anymore ..doubles cost of our lunch to pay for 2 small drinks."}
{"text":"Normally the customer service is not good at all, impatient and rude. Do not order anything with chicken. Our tacos were rotten-chicken is not supposed to smell like rotten lamb and eggs."}
{"text":"I stop by this Taco Bell every once in a while and the food is the same as most other TBs and by that a mean pretty tasty. But what sets this one apart is the service. The people working behind the counter are always friendly and go out of their way to be super helpful. The girl that took my order today even asked another customer if he would like suggestion.  Other food service establishments could take lessons here on how to treat customers."}
{"text":"So, I don't normally write bad reviews but tonight was a mess. We placed an order using the mobile app and when we got there (we marked \"I'm here\" via the app) the worker didn't even realize that it was a mobile order. Aside from that faux pas, when they FINALLY got our order together, our food was COLD and disgusting!! Now, I realize that Taco Bell isn't the epitome of Mexican cuisine, but come on! And to top it off, they completely forgot to give us an entire item that was ordered and paid for. Take a word of advice, DO NOT order from this Taco Bell. It's not even worth the cheap price tag."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Taco bell good is always good and made the way your ordered it. Good for. Quick fast nacho cheese for lunch"}
{"text":"So slow. I spent over 40 minutes in line, then my order was wrong & when I was handed my drink the lid was not on properly & spilled all over me. Instead of offering napkins the girl just shut the window & turned around. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Been going there for 6 years, and only half the time they get your order right, and half the time you get everything you ordered.better off going to the one on grand and bell."}
{"text":"too many young kids both hanging out here and on staff
messed up order, put no meat in the tacos...
called about it
said to bring in receipt and they will refund them
refunded the tacos but not the third item (granted, yes I ate the third item)
I still find it ridiculous to not refund the whole bill considering the gas I had to waste driving back because of one of the dumb employees, the third item was like a dollar...
durr didn't put meat in the taco. that's like not putting the meat patty in a burger, it's not even logical how it could possibly happen unless your like drunk on the job or something or just plain screwing with someones order.
will never go back."}
{"text":"My experience , was terrible. 
They never get my order correct. Once they pretend to, I get home and it is not correct."}
{"text":"I try not to eat fast food as much anymore but I love this Taco Bell. They are the best one I've been to in the valley. Much better than the one on blue diamond that seems to always be ten times more greasy. Don't get me wrong I have had a few minor hiccups here and there but overall this is a pretty good fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to in my life. I have been here multiple times, just for the fact it is 2 minutes from my house and it's open later than the one on snow. Every single time I come to this Taco Bell the mess up my food in some sort of way. Tonight's trip consisted of 2 double stack tacos, 2 cheesy potatoes, and a cheesy Gordita crunch. Everything without sour cream. At first I thought everything was good until I opened and tried to eat the nacho crunch Taco. This should not have sour cream on it but for some reason they decided to put it on it. I'm very disappointed in this Taco Bell because naturally it seems as if they fuck everything up. I'm not sure if it's because all of the workers are too stoned out of they're mind to read a screen correctly or if they're just fucking stupid. Save yourself some irritation and just go to the pearl road Taco Bell or snow road Taco Bell"}
{"text":"This place has the best service in a fast food restaurant! Food is what you expect for its price, but Baja blast Mountain Dew is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I guess being a fan of Taco Bell (and posting about it) cancels out my ability to write any food review ever again, let alone be taken seriously. 
It's a basic fast food chain, most people find it gross and repulsive but I think it's heaven. Constantly traveling and being on the road I find myself craving Taco Bell quite often. Definitely not a good thing but it just tastes too damn good. 
Obviously if you aren't into fast food, this isn't the place for you. But if you're jonesing for a delicious 5 layer burrito at 1 am, you've found it!
I especially enjoy this location by my house because little over a year ago some mofos thought it would be a good idea to burn it down, and they succeeded. But instead of Taco Bell rolling over and giving up they decided to rebuild. And what an amazing job they did. The new Taco Bell is the best one I have ever seen. Good on Taco Bell for shoving it right back in those kids faces!"}
{"text":"Today at Taco Bell I was baffled by the lack of customer service I received from Jenay C. She took an incredibly long time to put anything on the screen as I was in the drive thru. I have been to this taco bell before and she was there so I know she isn't new. She got every single aspect of my order wrong from things as \"complicated\" as no lettuce and no cheese to things as simple as wanting the Baja blast soda instead of the freeze. After correcting everything she put on the screen incorrectly I pulled to the window where I am told the Baja blast soda isn't working. Knowing there is another machine inside I asked her check if the one inside is working which I got the rude response of \"well I'm on this side of the counter.\" For being a place based on customer service I don't think it was much for me to ask her to step five feet over to ask the employees working the front if the machine out front is working. I then said that I would even be willing to go and fill it myself if that's what it took I just wanted to ensure the machine was working before I parked and went inside. I was then told I could check myself. As Baja blast is one of my favorite parts of taco bell I agreed to just do it because not only did I want the drink, but I simply just wanted my experience with this employee to end. Quite honestly I would drive out of my way to go to a farther location of taco bell just to avoid dealing with this employee ever again. In any other circumstance I would have simply asked to receive a different soda instead of the Baja blast, but due to the slowness, rudeness and inaccuracy of this employee I wanted to make sure one thing about my taco bell experience is right and that I got my Baja blast. I in fact parked and got the drink myself which is the only reason this place even deserves one star."}
{"text":"Went into the Gilbert Santan Market Place Taco Bell.  It was empty and I still had a long wait, but, what I saw made me demand my money back.  The manager who was helping prepare food wiped his face with his gloved hand and continued to prepare the food.  I walked to the counter and said cancel my order and give me my money back.  The manager didn't ask why and did not show any concern.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The prices have gone up and frankly $2 for a smallish bean burrito would have been okay if the burrito tasted good.
It didn't.
It wasn't toasted so the wrap tasted dry and bland.
Not enough cheese.
Even the beans tasted burnt. 

Honestly for $10, I could have made around 8-10 better bean burritos. Sticking to Taco Bell in the US. 

Service was fast though. Staff was nice enough."}
{"text":"This taco bell to me is wayy different then the other taco bells around. This one is one of the worst in the valley. The staff is very polite but the food is not good at all. I suggest going to the one on warm springs! Soo much better over there it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is starting to get ridiculous! Every time I go to this Taco Bell For some reason I seem to always get  old tortillas! My food is always falling apart because the tortillas are so old. I don't usually leave reviews but this is crap. And when I go into the store the employees are rude about it and give dirty looks. I know I'm not buying some expensive dinner but I am a paying customer! I feel like they just don't care! So if you don't want any crappy old tortillas then go to a different Taco Bell. I will not be getting food from this one ever again!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to the Spider Drive last week. The man who took our order appeared to be a manager, and his service skills were outstanding. Starting with his greeting as we walked in the door, to him offering to rewarm our food after a long chat with an acquaintance that we bumped into. This gentlemen will do great things to help this location bring in more business."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Taco Bell in quite a while.  No particular reason why.  I would always love to stop in for a Fiesta Taco Salad and would go through periods of craving them and eating far too many.  Maybe that's why I haven't been back in a while.  I am writing this review to specifically address what Taco Bell has done to my favorite menu item.  

Today I stopped at my local store and ordered a Fiesta Taco Salad with extra ground beef, extra beans, and guacamole.  I was shocked and disappointed in the changes Taco Bell has made to the Fiesta Taco Salad.  Why did they change what had been such a great thing?

Buried down in the bottom of one corner I found a sticky gob of plain white rice and didn't like finding it in there all.  What's up with that?  Filler?  It certainly wasn't there to add any flavor or appeal.  White rice in a Taco Salad, really?  Never heard of it.

And, had I not asked for extra beans, it seems there would have been none at all. I couldn't hardly find more than perhaps a teaspoon gobbed into the bottom of another corner.  They used to spread it across the bottom which used to be the best part to finish with the taco shell and Fire Sauce.

It was the same case with the extra ground beef.  There was not much there and certainly not what could be considered an extra portion.  I can only assume they have downsized portions on meat and beans to improve the nutritional profile. Taco Salad is not the most nutritional choice anyway, so why ruin for me if I choose to indulge?

I didn't appreciate finding those red tortilla strips already mixed into my salad. Although it's not a deal breaker, I always appreciated being able to decide how many to add and at what point while eating the salad.  Also, I'd often like to eat them alone because they were seasoned with salt and lime.

The taco shell itself used to be the best part of all, but now it's the biggest disappointment of all.  I can only suspect it is no longer fried in the store nor in real oil, nor is it even made of a flour tortilla.  I don't really know what it is, but it didn't look the same and certainly didn't taste the same.  It was no longer crunchy, delicate, and fall-apart delectable, had no taste except for staleness, and seemed it was maybe baked, or at least fried in imitation oil.

Just as the way so many other things are going these days, usually due to the business's own concerns about the bottom line, I was disappointed to learn that another truly great food item is gone.  They are no longer driven by the customer's experience and preferences but their own short sightedness.  I won't be back.

Adios, Fiesta Taco Salad.  Shame on you, Taco Bell."}
{"text":"well here we have it. just got dinner from this taco bell/ long john silvers, got  the order wrong, and shorted our hush puppies.
lately every fast food restaurant i go to is messing up the order some how.     and the want $15.00 an hour."}
{"text":"I go here frequently. Love the $5 boxes! Extra value meals are so expensive anymore. This is at least a semi- decent price."}
{"text":"In a town where there's no substance, no culture, where the only lovingly cooked hunk of meat is the care the drones at Native New Yorker take in making sure they poured the right pre-packaged sauce onto your order of chicken wings. Yes, in this insepid culinary anti-mecca sits a beacon of light and TACO be this BELL's name! 

Hardee-Har-Har!!

Okay, maybe I exaggerate. Perhaps the hot wing sauces at NNY are NOT prepackaged? lol... but I digress. 

I do like this Taco Bell, it doesn't have the ghetto overtone that most TBs in the city have. It's cleaner than most also. My favorite meal is three tacos with a Baja Blast & carmel apple empanada. Baja Blast is the BEST part of going to taco bell! It's an awesome soda! I wish they bottled it! I'd totally buy it by the two liter! :) 

Anyway - it's an awesome place. BUT they close early compared to other Taco Bells. so that kinda suckz. but oh well. it's all good. :)"}
{"text":"What the hell, ANOTHER fast food review??

Well yeah, you got a problem with it?   LOL

I'm getting ready to head back to LA and want to grab something quick for the road, I see Taco Hell and pull in the drive-thru.   I order an \"AM Crunchwrap\" and pull up to the window.   

I pay, get my change.... and before I can put my change away, she is handing me my order!   Boy that was FAST!

It tastes like others I've had, except when I get to that last bite, I now have fat/grease running down my finger and it gets on the steering wheel.   Oh joy!

Oh well, chock it up to eating in the car when you shouldn't be! 

3 stars rounded up to 4.   What can I say, I've got that Christmas spirit!"}
{"text":"OK.. I go to this one occasionally. There is a Taco Bell @ Decatur and I believe it is Pyle, but I couldn't find it here on yelp.com. Both places have good customer service, but the one at Decatur and Pyle is way better. Everytime I go there, there is this one employee who knows me and my family. He always makes sure that our order is completely filled because when he is not there, the other employees always mess up our order whether going in or thru the drive through. Almost as bad as the McDonald's down the road. We had Taco Bell for dinner last night. They now have the $2.00 meal deals. For the first time, I was able to walk out the door with a meal of less than $20.00 (matter of fact it was 7 meals of a gordita supreme, small bag of chips, and a medium drink with two soft tacos). You can't beat that. Thanks to the dude that always makes sure that we are completely happy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon at Noon.  Took 20 minutes for them to make my nachos. One guy waiting for his food crumpled his receipt and threw it behind the counter before storming out without his food order.  Some guests coming into order left because nobody took their order.  Never again."}
{"text":"This location must be under new management. I go more often then I should, my son loves the DLC Tacos, and every time we drive thru. The customer service is outstanding! They are so friendly and always make sure my order is correct, which it always is. I have not had a bad experience there aside from some of the questionable customers that show up. This is the only Taco Bell I love to go to."}
{"text":"Went for lunch..they took our whole 30 mins to get me 1 soft taco annnd then gave me the wrong taco... seriously!! Don't go on your lunch hour :/"}
{"text":"It was ghetto and dirty (as would be expected for a Taco Bell, especially in a crappier neighborhood), but the staff was friendly. I should also note that this Taco Bell is also a mini Pizza Hut, which was nice, since I enjoy both those brands."}
{"text":"I have been in the drive thru for 20 mins. So slow! Plus, this hasn't been the first time. Their service has become so slow. Their staff seems to not care about the quality of service. I updated my previous review of 4 stars to 1 star. I rarely give 1 stars, but this slow service happens every time. Unfortuanetly, this is the closest Taco Bell near here with a drive thru. And during the slow times, its not even busy!"}
{"text":"I am not ashamed that for someone with a sophisticated and adventurous palate, such as myself, I still love me some Taco Bell.  This is my go to location. It's clean, they get the food right 9 times out of 10 and they always seem to have something new for me to try.  Nacho Fries, Triple Melt burritos and nachos, naked chicken taco, inside out egg tacos, and the list goes on and on.  I was pleasantly greeted today at the speaker and then the window by Joneisha and it was nice to be greeted for the second visit in a row with a pleasant and professional staff member.  She got our order perfectly right and the food was hot and fresh.  
One thing that I thought was extremely unprofessional was a person in the background yelling at the employees with about 5 to 6 onlookers staring at her. I was in the drive thru but the window was open. She was going on about the trash and that she should be the only one to take the trash out or something. Whatever it was, why is she berating employees in front of all these people? How unprofessional.  I asked an employee who that was and was told she was a manager!  If the manager behaves like this, I can imagine morale around the place must be pretty low. I asked the staff member what the managers name was and it was Shamir(sp?). I certainly hope this was just a one time thing but I doubt it. Gives me flashbacks to my fast food days. 
So, this is my spot. I love Taco Bell. I am not ashamed. Sometimes you just have to take the plunge.
That is all!!"}
{"text":"This is our usual tb so I gotta represent.

Good:
Chicken quesadilla

Bad:
Sometimes a long line

One time they forgot to give us the sauce... So not as good!  This last time the guy must have sensed it because he have us like 20 so he made it up to is:)

The order has never been wrong that I can recall."}
{"text":"Was there last night at the drive up they forgot some of my order and they didn't answer their phone and I wasn't driving back, so I went to the web sight and today Carrie from Taco Bell called made it right that's great customer service I didn't expect 
Thank you"}
{"text":"I have never seen a line like the one at Taco Bell when the bars let out.

Insanity."}
{"text":"One star only because of the cashier Jamil. Otherwise you should keep running for the border or another restaurant! The manager Dave is the worst. Him a female staff member got combative and argumentative when I asked Jamil to remake my Mexican pizza. Jamil attempted to diffuse the situation by apologizing and getting me a ne pizza. I spent 15.00!on four items and all I wanted was a decent product. I'll never go there again. This wasn't even late night. I was there at noon. Sorry that Jamil has to work in a dump like that."}
{"text":"This is by far the best taco bell in the area. We order here at least once a week. Even though they are always busy, the employees are prompt and efficient. They ALWAYS get our order right, even though I'm a vegetarian and always making up complicated special orders. I love this particular location for the excellent customer service they provide and how clean the store always is. Give them all raises!! These are the type of employees you want to keep."}
{"text":"I always love me some taco bell from time to time. The food is what I expect from a fast food joint.. The soda on the other hand was not good. I didn't realize until I already left.. A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously?! Who goes to Taco Bell to expect anything great?  I know I don't.  I am not dining at a fancy place, not want to.  I'm on a budget, i'm hungry and addicted to Baja Blast.  Would it kill you guys to just get my order correct once? I'm not worried about you slipping in a beefy burrito from time to time after I ordered a chicken burrito, but don't ever forget my crunch wrap.  That is not okay! 

A man and his crunch wrap should never be separated.  I eat at 2:00 for lunch.  I'm freaking starving.  Last think I want is to turn around after the drive through and come find the kid who forgot to pull my tortilla and sour cream off the griller.  

After all that...i'll see you tomorrow.  Keep that Baja flowing!"}
{"text":"When the manager works the window everything always goes well and my order is never wrong. Lately there has been a lady working the register who always seems rushed and is very monotone, almost a little demanding. I asked for taco's with only lettuce and cheese, it even says so on my receipt but when I received the tacos they had everything. I also asked for no sauce on my quesadilla but they gave me one with sauce. Would recommend the power menu burrito and the cheesy gordita crunch with the nacho cheese Doritos shell."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty and the service was incredibly slow.   We went there on a Thursday night at 6:45 we waited over 20 minutes, then asked how much longer and they said they could not tell us.  We got our money back, walked over to Jimmy Johns and got our food in less than a minute.

The employees at Jimmy Johns were amazing, happy and provided very quick service. Employees at Taco bells seemed like they were miserable and moved at a very slow pace."}
{"text":"Staff was very professional. I had an issue with what I ordered and what I received, they were very sincere in their apology and made it right. Awesome drive thru crew! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"The tacos have like NO MEAT in them at all......I payed for a hard shell and that's it."}
{"text":"Food was unimpressive, but the staff was even worse. Poor attitudes, no smiles, drive through guy was very rude and made everything feel rushed. Way to welcome your customers"}
{"text":"We will never come to this taco bell ever again. The food that was ordered was incorrect and missing some items. The cashier was as dumb as the manager and couldn't seem to give us the correct amount of change due from a $50.00 bill even with the manager needing to bring out his phone to use the calculator and still had the amount wrong. 15 minutes just to get our order started through the drive thru, to have ended up in the store getting a complete refund, with $5.00 extra dollars because that's how incompetent they are."}
{"text":"They forgot to give me two items. I called and got Nina and told her I was on my way back. She gave me the food and credited me the meal price. She was extremely pleasant and empathetic. 

Now I wanted to try something new so I ordered the 7 layer burrito. I didn't ask what came in it but asked to get it without beans. When I bit into it there wasn't any meat. I called back and got another woman on the phone that said she was the one that took my order. She was rude and not at all empathetic. She said well I guess I should start telling our customers what comes in the burrito. I agreed and said if they are ordering without beans I would think she would say it doesn't have meat. My bad for not checking but her bad for not caring."}
{"text":"A little while back I stopped in during breakfast hours. I am not a regular so when I do stop I need to see the menu. I was first in line and waited while several employees scurried about. And I waited, and I waited... Might not have been bad if there was a menu anywhere with breakfast items to look at but there wasn't.

I then asked people in line behind me. They shrugged (possibly a language problem).

So I left. I went to the corporate website and registered my concern. Crickets. Nothing. I can only assume customer relations is not one of their priorities.

I still give it two stars since maybe the food is ok, I wouldn't know."}
{"text":"One of the better Taco Bell locations around. Consistent with portion size, temperature and taste. 

Its not good to eat there as much as I do, but the basic tacos and burritos are very good and better here than most surrounding locations."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went through the drive thru to order. When we got to the window, the woman who was not very happy, took our money then gave me our drinks, then shoved a bag in my face to me. When we got home the large drink I purchased a Large Mt.Dew tasted like non flavored soda water. Very disgusted with the attitude of the employees and the quality of the product served."}
{"text":"Well I was just in the area on vacation, and I was sight-seeing with my sons and we were checking out the construction on Snow road and we decided to stop at Taco Bell for a bite to eat. The first thing I noticed was how amazing the atmosphere is in it. It smells just like authentic Mexican food and the employees are very patient. I ordered a Double Chalupa box and it came with 3 items as well as a drink."}
{"text":"Well what can you really say, it's Taco Bell. My family rarely eat fast food, but once in awhile it always hits the spot. Unfortunately the service in the drive-thru deliberately tries to screw over the customer. Grouchy lady (not that I expect much anyway) with star tattoos on her neck ruined the experience. I asked for extra mild sauce, she repeated the request and then when we got home we had one packet for a family of four. Completely deliberate. If she's doing that imagine what she's doing to the store owner. Lady, if you don't like your job, quit! Let someone else get hired that wants to work."}
{"text":"I am giving this Taco Bell 5 stars based on a Great staff and my other taco bell experiences. This is one of the best staffed taco bells I have ever been to. Could use a little remodeling though but that's not the employees fault A+."}
{"text":"I was In line for 20 minutes the lady who took my order didn't seem like she knew what she was doing and my whole order was upside down"}
{"text":"This restaurant is, by far, the slowest place in the area.  From the time I walked in to the time I left with my food was 40 minutes.  Drive thru NEVER get's any order right.  Neither do the counters.  The people taking orders seem more interested in their phones than in the people trying to order.  Avoid at ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"The drive through lady was so dope, like, so dope. She was so nice I almost cried, we need more people like. Her charisma was poppin'."}
{"text":"Do not ever order in the restaurant. My kid had to use the restroom, so we ordered to go. Stood there for over 15 minutes waiting for our order, watching over 10 vehicles go thru the drive thru and get their order. Just shameful. Corporate must have some crazy time monitoring of their drive thru service, but if you choose to order inside you will just wait and wait and wait. Most of the time we waited it was this awkward staring at the two guys working the counter and wondering what the hell was taking so long."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, the cashier up front Irvin I believe was an amazing help and super friendly  we're definitely coming back to this Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Can be slow during major meal times. Other times can be very fast. Take caution if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I would give double 0's if I could! The shift manager Stephen was very rude. I ordered a nacho waited almost 15 mins to finally receive it only to have minimum to no nacho cheese sauce on it! I went to mention it to one of the line cooks and she said she would correct it. I stood there a few mins more only for Stephen to ask me what the issue was. I showed him and he said, \" that's the amount that comes on there. If you wanted extra cheese sauce you have to pay for it!\" Mind you he elevated his voice as if he wanted to embarrass me.\" I sat down allowed myself to cool and write this review instead of reacting in a way that wouldn't worked out for him. I am purely disgusted in the service. As I walked out I gave the nice older gentleman(that was the cashier) money for the cheese sauce however he wouldn't except it. Maybe he should be running this franchise instead. I understand fast food can become stressful and busy at times, however if you are in a position of leadership you should lead by example for your employees. This was not a good example of how you handle a customer discrepancy. Especially over 2 squirts of nacho cheese sauce! Poor leadership and customer service skills at its finest!"}
{"text":"I came in thinking I was gonna have a \"Naked Chicken Chalupa\" but it turns out they dont serve them anymore, and guess what else they dont serve, \"Naked Chicken Chips\"!!!
So i decided to get the \"Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos\" and when i was eating them, lettuce and chese fell everywhere and the shell didnt even taste like cool ranch doritos. The astablishment was full of agresive customers, and employeezys had distracting hairuts. NEVER EATING TACOS AGAIN."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and was very impressed. Not only were the bathrooms clean but the employees were very helpful and courteous. I had the nacho Bell Grande and it was delicious. I used to like Del Taco more but when you get service like this it's hard not to go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for a cheesy burrito and was actually quite pleased. It was hot and fresh. Tasted good."}
{"text":"Miss advertising and rude manager

Just placed an order for a number six posted on their current new menu inside. 2 chicken chalupa supreme with a taco. Received my order and it had all ground beef for taco and chalupa so I went back up to the counter and stood there for three - four minutes before anyone came to me. Mind you there were no guest in line. Stated I thought the number six came with chicken. The manager said no it's beef. My reply was your sign states chicken so as a customer how am I to know different. She looked at me like I should have known. And states well it's beef it comes with beef. Didn't she ask you what you wanted( referring to the cashier who helped me). No she didn't. My reply was. 

The manager just looked at me like I was in the wrong. Never offered to remake my food and stated you were charged for beef. So I said then you can just give me a refund and left. Great customer service; NOT!"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell location for food and service. They got the got my burrito order wrong and I happen to take a bite until I noticed and went to change it. The employees were talking to each other about my situation right across me rudely as if I couldn't hear them? They didn't want to change it to the correct one, said I already took a bite. Then changed they're mind and she took it and threw it in the trash. I said I'm right here I can hear you and I just took a bite can I just get what I originally ordered and in showed her on the receipt what I paid for. They said fine. I waited about 10-15 min and went up to ask about it turns out they forgot about it. Keep in mind it wasn't busy, didn't see anyone in the drive thru. Employees were rude. The potato in the potato tacos I ordered with no lettuce were really stale and cold the cheese didn't even melt. Like they just threw cold potato pieces. Finally after my brother finished eating I just took mine to go, didn't enjoy my meal what so ever. Do not recommend this location and I like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I came for a quick bite through the drive through with my sister, and my debit card was so scratched, since I was waiting for my new one to arrive still at the moment and it wasn't taking my payment. The fact that they still gave us our order even after they tried a million times was extremely nice of them. Employees were understanding and I was happy. I'm coming back and paying for what I owed. And the order was made correctly as I love their potato soft tacos."}
{"text":"Taco Bell by no means has great food, but you'd expect at least some reasonable service. Marjorie takes so long on the register, which just slows down everyone else. This location doesn't tend to mess up my order very often, but it is still by no means a place I would recomm"}
{"text":"I never thought that I would look forward to writing a review about a Taco Bell or even admitting to stopping in at one. I was cruising down the road and the primal urge of my adolescence kicked in when I saw the Taco Bell approaching off in the distance. This was high end dining for a 17 year old who just passed his driving test and for whatever reason I had to see what has changed over the years. 

Nothing has changed...I got exactly what I expected average quasi style cuisine from South of the border. But what was unexpected was the interactions I received from the employees at this location. I understand this is fast food but they are really drinking some purple cool aid in this joint. The gentleman who took my order was very professional, and he seemed geniune, and when they called my name, apparently they are using names know instead of numbers the person who left myfood at the counter actually smiled and said thanks have a good day. I almost think that this is CMU robotics laboratory experiment, are these pre-programmed robots or something? I have never had such a pleasant experience at a fast food establishment. The food, well,like I said it was what is to be expected. It satisified that urge and it was on to the South Hills..."}
{"text":"Order food online after 10 minutes says your order is ready show up wait another 20 minutes while they make it what a joke they are so worried about the dive through customers sorry they are to lazy to get of their cars and walk in. And the manager what a joke time to find some real employees"}
{"text":"don't know the difference between their grilled chicken and shredded chicken - waste of money as they didn't get the order right (and yes we specified the grilled chicken and it says so on the receipt) - let us know if you want our address to send us a refund (right)."}
{"text":"Unbelievable wait in the drive-thru tonight. It took over 30 mins from 5 cars back. Absurd!!!"}
{"text":"Just went in, because the drivethru takes at least an hour no matter what day of the week or time, and ordered fiesta potatoes. 

I got beans. Took 20 minutes and i got beans. No potatoes just beans. I mean it could be worse but they aren't cheesy sour cream covered potatoes."}
{"text":"The last couple times I've been here the drive thru girls are seriously rude! I think their are just being their normal selves. They look like kids and talk slang. They dont seem to care about appearance or customer service. They roll their eyes when you talk and drag their feet when they walk. They obviously don't want customers and I don't want to give my hard earned money to anyone that treats me like this for no reason!"}
{"text":"Now I guess after my last couple visits you're right back at giving me nearly empty taco shells! When I pay $25 every time I come I expect more than a few meat crumbles and lettuce.  I will probably switch to a different location again"}
{"text":"I agree with what others have said. It's like, \"Okay, it's just a Taco Bell...\" - but really, the employees there have amazing attitudes! I have even been complimented going through the drive through. They seem genuinely happy to be there, and even if it's just for show...it makes me want to come back. Cheesy Gordita Crunch for LIFE!"}
{"text":"This place is a mess. The past 6 times I've been here over the past 3 months there has been an incredible delay in the drive thru, orders messed up and overall just disaster. Food came out cold one time, which is surprising consider I waited 20 minutes in the drive thru for it. Another time 3 out of the 4 crunchy tacos were crushed when we got them. The employees look like they have no idea what to do. Overall, this taco ball falls short in capable management."}
{"text":"The KFC part is decent but don't go to this location for the Taco Bell part. Save yourself frustration and drive down the road on Albemarle (going east) towards Target and go to the standalone Taco Bell. The KFC combo location doesn't get their orders correct and the food is awful."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the food itself, every time I go here, my food is wet, cold, and looks disgusting. I always get a chicken quesadilla and it always ends up being cold, and the cheese is NEVER melted. My soft tacos ended up being wet.. how do you even explain why.. and the customer service is okay.. a few people are very nice and the rest have VERY bad attitudes."}
{"text":"If you want to wait over a half hour for FAST FOOD anytime of the day then come to this Taco Bell!! Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. I have been coming since before they had remodeled. The food is great. Never been sick but the service. Wow! Juanita is so amazing. Always happy, so sweet. I love her and she makes sitting in the drive thru completely worth it. This woman needs a raise. STAT! No I don't know her, but I am so impressed every time I go in that I had to write her a great yelp review! You are the best Juanita!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food through the drive thru came all the way home just to find a bug inside my food! This is disgusting! Will never be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Best value stoner food.
I always get build a box.  Hard taco soft burrito  nachos and a pie with a drink for $6.25 tax in
Great deal it fills me up.
When your paying so little you can't complain. 
Food was hit service was great."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to go to this taco bell. They are always extremely sweet to me and provide great customer service. I have yet to have a bad experience here. It's the first taco bell i've been to that they don't seem like they genuinely hate their jobs."}
{"text":"Ordered a 7 layer with no faux guac and a steak taco with special sauce.  They were lovely.  Besides that I had a breakfast sandwich the whole weekend.  The rest of my energy came from Vodka."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly! I have 3 kids who love Taco Bell! This place gets our order right, and they are quick!"}
{"text":"Screw this place. Seriously.

If I'm going to TB, I'm 90% of the time doing drive-thru. If I don't have the time to respect my body, I don't have the time to sit on plastic chairs and listen to top 40 garbage, either. Both times I've been to this particular restaurant, I got held up for an excessive amount of time behind a female who so charmed the drive-thru personnel that I had to wait an extra 10 minutes. The first time I had to fight off a horde of angry ASU sophomores who took exception to the trollop who cut in front of us on foot and got service. This time, I decided to share it rather than cause trouble. Take that, class of 2012."}
{"text":"The nicest staff I've ever met. Had a small issue with an item and they went above and beyond to fix it and make sure I was happy. Needless to say, I will be coming back. 

swag."}
{"text":"This is a Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo, but it might as well not be. They NEVER have pizza, they NEVER have breadsticks. Even at 11:30 on a Tuesday. It's ridiculous. Just take their name off your sign and their menu off your board!!"}
{"text":"Found a piece of rubber in my drink that somehow fell off the unsweetened ice tea machine. Looks like it's been so whomever ordered a ice tea lately that squishy bits you felt are rubber."}
{"text":"I worked for this Taco Bell for 5 weeks and have yet to get a single paycheck, the boss is super irresponsible and very unfair to me as an employee. The chicken steak and beef that goes on your tacos is boiled in a plastic bag (for maximum chemical absobtion. I will never eat here again and highly discourage working here."}
{"text":"Slowest taco bell I've ever been to. If you are in a hurry and need a quick bite to eat. Not the place for you."}
{"text":"I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO GIVE THIS SORRY OF AN EXCUSE FOR TACO BELL A 1/2 STAR RATING. 
     I am absolutely disgusted, humiliated, and traumatized by the experience I had at this Taco Bell tonight. I was visiting my sick grandmother at the nearby hospital, and after having such a long and emotionally draining day I said to myself, \"hey, let's go to Taco Bell...that'll cheer me up\" 
     OH BOY BOY BOY BOY BOY WAS I DEAD WRONG. 
I ordered my usual. Yanno. My go-to when I'm feeling sad, the double chalupa box. And just as I was wiping my tears of sadness from my face about my sick grandmother, and about to sink my teeth into my favorite meal that was created by the Mexican-American gods........
     BAM SOMETHING TICKLED MY GOD DAMN LIPS. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS. BLONDE HAIR. BLONDE MOTHER FUKKING HAIR.  And do you wanna know the craziest part...I HAVE BLACK HAIR. BOX DYED BLACK F-ING HAIR. I DONT EVEN HAVE A BLONDE PUBE ON ME. 
     I don't recommend this place to anyone. I definitely don't recommend it if you're going thru a tough time and need some pick me up chalups. Just drive your face right into the cement and then have someone step on your face American History X style. It will be better than eating a hairy chalupa. I promise."}
{"text":"Drive thru order taker refused to change my drink size, said it only comes in large. Ummm, what??? In retaliation, when I was given my large drink the lid was not on all the way so it spilled all over my car. Every time I come here there is some problem, usually with the 2nd window not the 1st. Drive the few extra miles and go to the Taco Bell on Cave Creek and Bell."}
{"text":"I really like this taco bell and come here quite often. They usually have good service and the prices are great. My only complaint is that a lot of the times we come here they get my friends order wrong when he specifically asks for his tacos to only have meat and cheese."}
{"text":"This taco Bell is always on point! Their staff is friendly, the food is always correct and they're fast."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad even for a taco Bell. The teenagers working here clearly don't give a f@&k.  How does 'extra hot sauce' equal NO hot sauce?  The girl that is repeatedly at the window has gigantic fake nails that are strictly against Dane county health code (I know because I run a food establishment).  I know, it's taco Bell, but this is a down grade even to that low standard..."}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. Ignore you as you stand at the counter waiting to be helped. No acknowledgement that you're there just a rude restaurant"}
{"text":"Girl at the drive thru was practically yelling the whole time.When I tried handing her the money, she said ;wait hold on and then she slammed the window. To top it off no sauce, napkins or receipt.When I stayed at the drive thru window to ask for them, she just stood there and look at me and walked away.Never going back to this place since I called the manager but she wasn't very concerned to hear me out. Totally rude!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell location I have ever been to. The last two times I was there they completely got my order wrong and the food was awful. Today I decided to try it again in desperation and it was awful. They made the wrong order and the taco's were soggy and what I think may have been a Mexican pizza was an epic fail. I didn't eat my meal. I threw it away. Taco Bell you have permanently lost my business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food restaurant as they are the friendliest place in all of Buckeye. They are inexpensive but good food. If we are short on funds and want a great meal we always go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"My cup spilled tea all over my car.  Even when I made sure it was on there it would not stop leaking. Then it was warm with very little ice. It never got cold. The food was great though. The tea was very frustrating!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a few times and the food is always good, but the wait is crazy every time! I went last night and I stood around for 20 minutes waiting for 3 tacos. They were pretty busy but it still seemed like a long time. 

If you're eating in and not in a rush I'd still recommend going here if you like this type of food, I've never had an issue with the taste or quality."}
{"text":"EXCUSES AND EXCUSES First off let me say, I frequently came thru here during the summer between the hours of 3-4am and sometimes MINUTES before they closed and I got ANYTHING on the menu, now all of a sudden two Saturdays in a row both at 3:30 am they are full of excuses why they either aren't open like they should be or that the grills are turned off - then if it's standard practice to shut the grills off that early beige closing then tell me how I've gotten grilled items such as a quesorito at 3:50am ? Last week the \"resisters malfunctioned\" and they closed early .... Bull f*cking sh*t - I sure hope a regional manager reads this BS - better off avoid this one and I'll just complain to Taco Bell corporate"}
{"text":"I hate that you can't trust Yelp reviews anymore bc of fraud (I was offered good money to write bogus reviews- so I take everything I read here with a grain of salt)  Nevertheless I hope that Taco Bell management reads this occasionally...altho I doubt it.  
So anyway.....
Most people write reviews to complain.  I'm trying to be more conscious about the reviews I write & write good reviews, as well as the inevitable bad ones.
Which brings me to my reason for the 5 Stars.  It's NOT bc of the food.  I'm NOT a fan of fast food, but my husband likes it so I acquiesce... sometimes.   

SUSAN is the reason I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars.  
I'm a big believer that ANY place of business will excel if they treat their employees right.  I wrote another review of this same restaurant bc of another woman who worked there & she quit shortly afterwards.  
My guess is that management & TPTB @ Taco Bell do NOT know how to treat & therefore retain good employees.  We'll see how long Susan continues to work at Taco Bell, I'm guessing if she's gone before too long... then we'll know the reason WHY.  
THIS IS A MULTI BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY FOR GOD'S SAKE!
Can't someone catch a clue???"}
{"text":"Just don't. Sucks so bad. Waited 26 minutes for 2 tacos and slow service like that has happened every time I've gone here. No management."}
{"text":"Why do ppl hate Taco Bell? Tasty, cheap food. Slow service a lot for whatever reason but so good."}
{"text":"Rude order takers, very dirty floors and counters in the entire place (restaurant, food prep areas and order pick up counter). Somehow they have a health score of 96.5. Must have been tipped off as to when they'd be inspected bc as far as I could tell the place is a disaster. Waited for 25 minutes for a medium sized to go order today. Only a handful of other customers in the place/drive through at 3:30 on a Sunday. Not sure what the challenge is but maybe start by hiring some help who give a shit. Chik fil A at Stonecrest would be a good place for the Taco Bell manager to visit and see how to run a store. Overall horrible customer service at this Taco Bell today. Hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"Did not complete my order.  If you want to order to go,  make sure that you check your food correctly."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. It is hands down the best taco bell I've ever been to. They hook the food up and have never been rude. The worst that's ever happened was just forgetting to put my sauce in the bag, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Excellent Taco Bell!  Conveniently located right by the hospital.  The restaurant is always clean, the food is always delicious, and the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Taco Bell some of you refer to this place as Nature's Natural Enema.
But you always go back.............Tell me you don't.

I must admit had to try the new loaded grillers.
I found out the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Griller...............Was very good.  I think they use the Volcano sauce in there cause it had some KICK!!!

I had to share that with you Yelpers!!!  Anyone try them??"}
{"text":"While on a long road trip, I stopped at this Taco Bell in Buckeye. As I always do at Taco Bells across the country, I ordered a Vegetarian cantina power burrito, which should be just like all cantina burritos, containing Pico di gallo, guac, sour cream, lettuce and your choice of protein. In the case of the vegetarian option, this protein would be black beans. Unfortunately, it wasn't until we were many, many miles down the interstate that I was unpleasantly shocked to find that I had just paid over $5 for a grilled tortilla filled only with iceberg lettuce. It seems the employees here are perplexed by the term vegetarian. Definitely would not recommend. My lunch sucked."}
{"text":"¡Muy bueno! Customer service is exceptional. The manager even remembers our orders. Phenomenal place, and very fresh. You can taste the difference in quality."}
{"text":"Prices rocketed as of about 6 months ago (so I limit my visits to Taco Bell in general these days), customer service so-so, quality of food not good due to preparation.

The last time I visited this venue (I believe it was around January or February of this year), one of the attendants was cleaning of pop machine in mid-day which made me sick to my stomach. She offered to let me use the fountain machine while she was in the middle of cleaning it as well, which did not make me feel any better.

Due to the way my meal was prepared, it was falling apart on me.

I've been to this location numerous times, and tend to always have one issue or another there, so I'm extremely unlikely to be returning there."}
{"text":"Been sitting in drive through for over 20 minuets while the cashier is talking to the car in front of us after they got their food. So rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place makes me crazy, I'm not sure why I keep going back.

The food is so-so, I got a taco supreme the other day and my sour cream was on the OUTSIDE of my taco. As in, between the shell and the wrapper. Very helpful. 

Plus, they are the slowest place ever. I timed my last visit - from the time printed on my receipt until I got my food was 12 minutes. Seriously? This is fast food people. And it's not complicated. The drive through moves way faster - I'm tempted to go through that and just eat in my car in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I ordered cheesy fiesta potatoes and they charge me for it but then they didnt give it to me.  They closed at like 11:50 instead of 12. So I couldn't go back and complain.  In the end I just went to Carl's Jr because my fat butt was still hungry.  What the heck.  It's ok, everything was else was fine, that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Wow my first review!  Yeah!  I ate there for lunch last week and tried their new menu items.  It was the Cantina Burrito!  Very Very good, but what stood in my mind the most was the young man that waited on me.  I was ordering lunch for two other people to take back to work and he saw me struggling with handling 3 drinks, so he offered me a beverage carrier!  Then he ran and opened the door for me since he saw my hands full.  

Just saying great customer service!  Kudos to a great employee."}
{"text":"This place is horrible across the board.  Stopped by on a road trip and the food was awful.  Complained had it remade and the same result.  My wife and i threw the food away and went across the street to the pizza hut.  If you stop in tuscola trust me the pizza hut is the one i would choose."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Stopped in today, won't be going back.  I ordered a grilled chicken taco supreme, but when I opened it, it was a soggy tortilla doused in red sauce, some cheese, lettuce, a few diced tomatoes, and sour cream on the edge.  No chicken.  I'm not sure what it was supposed to be, but it's in the trash now."}
{"text":"They ALWAYS mess up my order and never apologize or do anything to compensate. Yeah they fix my food for me but this happens literally every. single. time. 
The reason I continue to go here is because it's the closest thing to my house and when I'm just getting off work at 11:00-midnight I don't feel like going out of my way to eat somewhere farther away, this is a quick and cheap meal for me. But when I specifically say what I want and make sure it's correct on the ordering screen, the people in the back shouldn't mess it up. Especially because I'm basically a regular by now. And tonight I ordered simply some nachos and cheese...and didn't get any cheese with it. Just a couple chips."}
{"text":"As good as any! I felt compelled to review since everyone else seems to hate on this place. Sure, it has long lines at 12:30 (it'd be weird if it didn't!). But service was crazy fast and friendly. 

And they didn't skimp on my request for lots of mild sauce."}
{"text":"I will not apologize for my obsession with Taco Bell!!!

Three words: cheesy gordita crunch.

Staff seems genuinely happy to be there and doles out more than enough sauce whenever I request \"a ton\" of mild sauce.

This location hasn't been updated, but as such, has a nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"This location at southland is the best!! Always nice, fresh, fast and accurate!! Just wanted to say thank you!!"}
{"text":"What a dump! Messy messy. Stale food. Sloppy employees. WTF Taco Bell?!?! Someone please clean this place up."}
{"text":"Do not go here!! They cannot do their job; in any way. I even saw one of the cashiers hanging out of the drive-thru window smoking something that a driver handed them. Weight is literally around the building. Staff is unprofessional to say the least. And extremely rude. I had a manager hang up on me"}
{"text":"i came here and this dude gives me the wrong thing then proceeds to run outside and scream at me because he messed up like already don't like it here but damn"}
{"text":"I must have come on a bad night. The Spicy Potato Soft taco barely had any potatoes, the spicy chicken quesadilla was sloppy, and the Crunchy Frito Burrito didn't have any Fritos and tasted like cardboard. Taco Bell you did me wrong tonight."}
{"text":"I only go to Taco Bell late at night when everything else is closed.  I keep coming back.  I can't help myself.  This is a disease more than a quest for sustenance. Regardless of what you order the items taste the same.  The Taco Bell taste is a characteristic flavor and texture that immediately triggers the brain's memory.  The strange amalgam of ingredients seem to converge to an equilibrium for every menu item so that the result is always the same.  I'm sure PhD chemists were involved in this.  Like a Siren's song once you fall prey to its call, you can never break its grip on you.  Those who pray at the alter of the fourth meal temple are too familiar with this.  Don't believe me, check out the long lines in the drive thru after midnight.  It's a shared addiction suffered by midnight fast food junkies.  Anticipation heightens.

I don't know what to say.  The food is inconsistent in every way. The portions vary wildly. The regular taco is noteworthy in this sense.  I've had them with literally a sprinkling of ingredients in the shell.  What manner of man does this to a hungry fellow man?  Oh, a cruel twist of fate.  A tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.  Did the preparer not think of our eventual disappointment upon discovery of an empty shell?  Should any man be confronted by such an existential moment so late at night on an empty stomach?   Anxiety riddles.

They routinely run out of ingredients.  \"We're out of tomatoes.  Is that OK?\"  \"On a Taco Supreme?  Are you kidding me?\" \"No more hot sauce?\"  \"What?  Isn't this supposed to be a Mexican food restaurant?\".  Who has the mental acuity this late at night to make such weighty decisions on an empty stomach no less?  Not me.  Frustration mounts.

The iconic Burrito Supreme.  It was legendary when first unveiled years ago.  Today it serves only as a sad reminder of what was once the leading edge in burrito offerings.  It's now embarrassingly undersized with ingredients that mix together into an unidentifiable goo.  The stuff is almost fluid and seeps towards one end so by the time you open it at home, you have to squeeze it to even it out.  Can you imagine ever having to do this at Chipotle?  And yet I order one with every visit.  Help me.  Help me.  Hopelessness envelopes.

And what is it that compels you to buy five tacos and two burritos every visit?  Yet ironically, you can never get full on Taco Bell food.  Your jaw tires before your stomach is ever full.  Unrewarded gluttony.

Service.  Volumes could be written about this.  Service at Taco Bell tends to be more of an event than an experience.  The bottom rung of the human food chain must start with the midnight shift at Taco Bell.  How long can it possibly take to get an order, punch a few keys on the register and slap together a couple of tacos?  The pace is excruciatingly glacial.  Impatience overwhelms.

I shudder to guess what the turnover rate is for the midnight crew.   This is evidenced by the blank stares, the long hesitation, the occasional look of terror that are dead giveaways for a first day on the job.  It happens every visit.  These poor souls are the tip of the spear in fast food.  Like advance recon in infantry, these guys and gals don't last long.  They're human cannon fodder.  If you have an ounce of humanity in you, you can't help but pity them knowing you'll never see them again, even if you go back the next night.    Sorrow weighs heavily.

And so ends another midnight trip to Taco Bell. All that suspense and adventure for eight bucks.  You laugh, you cry.  What other late night fast food joint offers more?"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell...A fast food chain...How anti-Yelp of me. I may even get a talk thread all about me as an example of all things wrong with Yelp..But I eat TB alot and frankly each deserves a different rating so why not give it a go? 

If you need your fix of burrito with fillings from a caulking gun I would reccomend you drive to the next TB since they are on every corner and this one is sub par. My half pound cheesy bean burrito weighed nowhere near a half pound and while I can't figure out which layer was missing there were definately only 6 layers in my 7 layer burrito. 

There is a Del Taco across the street; what was I thinking?

On the plus side when I say alot of fire sauce, I mean it and they complied."}
{"text":"The drive thru guy was outstanding and if you are a manager for this place it was at 8:25pm on March 25th 2013.  Good job hiring this guy!"}
{"text":"It took me 17 minutes to get through the drive thru. What I thought was going to be a quick pitstop to grab food, became a long and annoying wait. I got home to find my tacos thrown together in a mess and cold."}
{"text":"What can I say... It's just Taco Bell.  Hehe.  This location is closest to my home & I come here more often than any other taco bells in Henderson or Las Vegas.  Especially on my way home & i'm starvin'.  I don't eat here too often though.  The workers here are very upbeat when going through the drive thru which is nice.  I ate in there once & it was a normal experience.  You order your food, get it, then eat it! =) Food is pretty consistant & orders are always on point.  I haven't had any problems w/ the workers or anything.  They all seem to love their jobs I guess.  ^_^ They don't show that they hate it there like other workers at other fast food places do.  All in all.... it's a good taco bell location!"}
{"text":"For what it is, a Taco Bell, this place is solid. Friendly staff, been going here for years. My favorite of the chain."}
{"text":"I came to this location, this girl TYRA N took my order with an attitude but I thought to myself \"everyone has their days\".. I asked for a combo 9 with no tomatoes and extra nacho cheese as well as the taco with extra nacho cheese. I am allergic to tomatoes and as I checked my order I thankfully noticed the tomatoes. I go back to this place and tell them that they messed up my order. The first thing that the \"Manager\" told me was \"ok but you can't keep the food\" I didn't want to keep the food because it had TOMATOES! So they do my order all over again and trusting the \"Manager\" I leave back to my hotel to come and find out that my crunchwrap supreme has no nacho cheese. I know they did that on purpose. #Furious"}
{"text":"Eating here it felt like I was Riding a Unicorn down a mountain while drinking from a Goblet filled with the laughter of Children. Demolition Man the movie has Taco Bell as a fine dining establishment in the future I can now see why. Eating the Chalupa Supreme makes me have faith in humanity that we can over come obstacles and create beautiful things. You could put anything inside a Chalupa bun and it would be delicious. I cut off some of my beard and put it in the Chalupa it was outstanding. I think part of the reason it was so good is because I had some Hummus from Greek Pita left in my beard."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Definitely recommend to anyone, service is awesome, the owner is a sweet heart. There's a reason I come here once a week!! Also, try the quesalupa! ;)"}
{"text":"They are soooooo slow and don't care what they put into your bag when going thru drive through. First they got my order wrong, then they forgot to add hot sauce when I specifically asked for it twice"}
{"text":"I stopped by here morning after rave.  Just wanted me some taco bell after 18 hours of not eating. Drove there. Got my food. Got home. They fucked it up. Went back. They gave me the right food but no compensation. Thanks a lot for wasting my time assholes"}
{"text":"I can say every order is always correct and drive thru staff is polite! Food is always hot and never a wait in the drive thru."}
{"text":"The older white lady got mad at me for her mistakes when she told me that they took Apple Pay and the didn't then messed up the order and blamed it on us"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for Taco Bell the other night, so we went through the drive-thru. We repeated our order several times to ensure accuracy, but when we got home with our food that was the last word I would use to describe what we got. 

Both of us asked for the new shredded chicken and didn't get it. We thought that maybe they didn't have it, but then they should've said something. Both of our sodas had run out of syrup, so we had to dump them out and I asked for no tomatoes, and instead got tomatoes on everything.

This is the closest Taco Bell to us, so we are stuck with it. If you do have a choice, choose a different location."}
{"text":"I have avoided Taco Bell for years but was stuck with no other options in this neighborhood. I was shocked!

Great food!!! Great service!!! The Doritos Fiery Taco was FANTASTIC! This is the best Taco Bell I've been in literally in 20 years!!

Teresa was super friendly and the service workers in the back were friendly too. When I'm back in this neighborhood I'll definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"taco bell is taco bell. i eat these every week. even if i found hair or gold. Fast food employee are usually work long hours with many demanding customer.  any one who label cashier is rude is obviously never work a day in their life.  fast food never know when they will be busy. if anyone can accurately prediction will be very famous. otherwise any one like Gabrielle W. and Irida N.
  go taco bell and complain is just unimaginable.  Maybe the day when google can invent robot to serve these complaining idiot then perhap we can live in happier world. meanwhile Irida N. and Gabrielle W are just plain snobbish elitist whining princess."}
{"text":"I love taco bell and i eat here every days. Its fast food so why people would  still complain is beyond me. But seriously people!!!!! the reason why fast food does not please everyone is the demand and timing equation.  If anyone can accurately can solve this equation they will become very rich or famous.  Meanwhile anyone who would post a one star for a fast food restaurant are super duper freak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a triple layer nacho with my meal. I wasn't aware that hair is one of the 3 layers. I didn't realize till I was half way through my meal. Can't eat the rest and doubt I will ever visit a Taco Bell again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Waited 15+ min in drive thru only to find cardboard in my vegetarian crunchwrap. Super gross"}
{"text":"16 minutes from placing an order at Drive through to getting my food. Girl at the window had zero social skills. No response to \"hi how are you?\" Or \"thank you.\" Slammed the window shut. Sadly the joke was on me as I got food poisoning and spent the better part of the next 48 hours puking up pigs in a blanket."}
{"text":"We are \"those\" customers who always order our food made special... extra this, extra that, no this,  no that.  The last time we ordered,  it was a bit pricey (especially for fast food) and the manager offered to buy our next meal.  How nice was that! wow!"}
{"text":"Service so unkind. Instead of \"Hello\" i got \"order when your ready\". Idk but to me that is disrespectful. & their freezee machine is ALWAYS down. Not to mention they WILL NOT DO TWO ORDERS. All it is, is a click of a button."}
{"text":"Definitely check this place out if you want to see a reenactment of the DMV scene from the movie Zootopia! 

Update-2/8/17-Why do I torture myself by coming here yet again? As I write this I am sitting in the drive tru. I would pull off but the drive is designed that once you are in line there is no way to pull around or back up in my case since there are 5 cars in line behind me. I've been here 20 minutes. After I made my order, the girl working the window accidentally left her mic on and I could hear a coworker yelling in the background to another employee about a mixup in scheduling and this went on for minutes. I will laugh about this later I guess."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this location. It is right around the corner from my house, which makes it incredibly convenient. In the three years I have been coming to this location, I have never had anything wrong with my order. I always come later at night and usually within a couple hours of closing. 

The reason for the sudden review after so long is a drive through cashier named Dominique M. (That's the name that was on the receipt. It was Monday night at 11:50.) I generally don't like to visit fast food places minutes before closing because I don't want to inconvenience them after a long shift. I didn't even realize it was so late until after I ordered. Even though there were only minutes left before closing, he was very kind and patient. He didn't rush me at all, and told me to take my time. When I got to the window there was something I had forgotten to order at the drive through screen. He didn't seem annoyed at all, and even had a smile on his face the entire time. HE actually apologized to ME for the wait at the window, even though there wasn't a wait at all. Of all the fast food cashiers I have encountered, he left a memorable impression. Even though our transaction was no longer than a few minutes, I left with a smile, knowing that I needed to make management aware of the great employee they have running their drive through window."}
{"text":"This place is liiitttttt I recommend coming to this taco Bell and only this taco Bell"}
{"text":"My experience was horrible. I ordered dinner for the family. My wife and I decided to try the quesalupa, a marketing wonder. The worker in the drivethru was chipper and nice. She was surprisingly pleasant. I wish my food had been the same. After I was home we opened our food to discover that the two quesalupas were completely different. One appeared to have a shell on the outside like a cheesy Gordita crunch, the other did not. My wife took one bite and said that it wasn't right. I decided to return the item. At this point I realized I was not given are receipt at the drivethru. I thought to myself \"they'll be reasonable and see that this was an error.\" I was wrong. The same chipper manager from the drive thru then absolutely refused to refund my money. She offered more food which at this point was useless as my family had finished dinner. It was a pathetic display of customer service. This Taco Bell refused to fix the mistake and instead tried to throw more product at me. 

Please do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. This store is awful and though it is near to my home I will never to go back. Read the other reviews, they don't lie."}
{"text":"A shout out to the employees at the Thomas Taco Bell.  During lunch there was an extremely rude,  abusive,  and irrationally demanding customer.  Despite the flurry of f-bombs he kept dropping,  the staff maintained their composure, got the guy what he wanted and defused the situation. Nice job!"}
{"text":"I wish I'd gotten her name so I could call her out specifically, but the young lady working the drive through today was super chipper and happy with a little bit of silly and she totally made my day. Not to mention my food was fast, hot, and exactly how I ordered it. Well done!"}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service the man took my order Nd asked my name I told him it nd  say down to wait for my order I notice a man putting my order on the counter no saying my name or order so finally I walked to the counter it was mine the food was not hot nd I would never go back"}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bell goes, I find the service find. In my opinion though, just like every other Taco Bell I've been to, the meat is terrible. Even fast food has standards of meat, like A&W, Wendy's and Harvey's are decent. This is like a whole different class of terrible meat. This place is good for a quick snack of fries or nachos, I just wouldn't touch the meat."}
{"text":"The services was okay, they got it all correct the there was literally no cinnamon sugar on the twists....."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. My house is by this location so I tend to have to go to it more often than others and there's ALWAYS food missing, and I'm not even exaggerating it's a literal shock when my order is completely correct. Half of the menu they don't even have displayed and when you ask the workers a question they never know the answer and they're RUDE! I understand this a fast food facility but when i say their food is never fresh i mean you can tell id been sitting AT LEAST a few hours, tacos ALWAYS soggy, and they ran out of tortillas an entire day. YOU COULDNT ORDER MORE HAN HALF OF THEIR MENU!"}
{"text":"We normally have a good experience here but today we didn't.
Me and my family went for dinner and i ordered an air head freeze blue raspberry and my girlfriend didn't finish it so she brought? it home and shes looking at it shaking it and stuff to make it more slushy and there's a DAM HAIR! 
So i go back and the manager doesn't even apologize all she does is give me a refund on my meal and that's it?
Like really you don't even apalogize or anything 
Yeah they lost my service"}
{"text":"Is it just me or does this Taco Bell location charge twice as much as the one down the street? Save your money and go to the one at Happy Valley & 67th!"}
{"text":"So I used to be a regular at this establishment; it's location made it a convenient quick-stop when going to or from work.

My most recent visit was through the drive through. It was around 11:00pm, and I had just gotten off work. As I pulled up, the speaker erupted into loud, unintelligible static for about a minute, before cutting off. Worried it might be broken, I called out a \"hello,\" to see if anyone could hear me. Immediately, the girl on the other end began screaming and swearing at me, calling me all sorts of foul names and talking about how I had \"already pissed her off.\" Needless to say, I drove off.

I called the manager shortly thereafter, and was casually brushed aside with a \"yeah, yeah, We'll talk to her.\" I wasn't even given so much as an apology.

That was that, and at that point I had no choice but to report them to corporate. Needless to say, I will no longer be frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"This taco bell is clean and the staff is friendly. Our order is never messed up and the soda's are freaking AMAZING!! Taco bell has the best Dr. Pepper of any restaurant period!"}
{"text":"Now I know it's Taco Bell, but this was ridiculous. Went through the drive thru and ordered 12 pack of tacos. First, while ordering someone had a headset and kept saying \"no\" through the entercom while the girl was taking out order. Then it took 10 minutes to get 12 regular tacos. Not acceptable. There was a lot of goofing off in the store and great that kids are working, but they need a manager that can keep them being respectful to their customers."}
{"text":"this taco bell on a daily basis forgets full order,slow service,sticky floors,not my favorite."}
{"text":"slowest in town don't come on your lunch break the girls in there play on there phone and argue to see who has to help the next customer if anyone has been to this location you know all about the slow drive thru its worst inside feel bad for the manager the only one working every time i go in Taco Bell is awesome but not this ONE"}
{"text":"The 12 Taco Pack is advertised as a variety of specialty tacos. I received 12 Crunchy Tacos. Also, I could barely hear the soft voice on the speaker or at the window. One of the worst Taco Bell experiences that I've had."}
{"text":"After seeing many promotions for the breakfast there, I decided to detour from the backed up traffic on the local interstate to get breakfast.  The service was great.  I was not sure of how the popular crunch wrap was served so had a lot of questions.  I ended up buying 2 just to sample both.  Also purchase a combo that included coffee and those cinnabon delights.  All of the food was great.  I wish that there were more of those little cinnabons in the combo!!!!  They were good.  For a fast food breakfast...that is conveniently located off the highway....I can go there a few more times!!!!"}
{"text":"It's funny but still bad customer service that they have a sign up but don't have the item they're promoting. Taco Bell, get your act together."}
{"text":"Clean place, food is what it is. The jackass behind the counter wearing the sombrero and yelling really bad lil john impersonations is way too much. Get some class or respect your customers."}
{"text":"This is one of the most exquisite Taco Belles in all of the Phoenix Valley. All I can say is WOW!!! So. Let me start with the décor. Classic movie posters really put me in the mood for some authentic Mexican food. Now, let tell you that not all Taco Bells are created equal. This one is truly a cut above the rest. It's finger lickin good. Definitely RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Wow. Where to start? This is quite simply the most delightful Taco Bell dining experience I have ever had. Top notch service, exquisite, perfectly spiced beans, and finest quality of cheese I've encountered since childhood. The sauce packets make for a customizable experience that can't be beat, and their logos consistently find ways to uplift me when I need it. I love their exclusive rewards and offers. Live más indeed, Taco Belle."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better cantina bowls. Skimping on the protein is not my idea of treating customers right. Although the service was quick and efficient. Drive thru was really fast, even made sure I had an extra fork in case he forgot to stick one in there."}
{"text":"I had got the crunch wrap with chicken and an order of Cheese fiesta potatoes on Wednesday, I got food poisoning for two days... Horrible. Sad to say I will never return to Taco Bell again. Never in my life have I had food poisoning, and it is Aweful. Sad because I ate here atlwast once ever other week because it's walking distance from my house. Still thinking about this is making my stomach turn."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but the manager,  an Asian gentleman, was entirely rude to someone I was with.   Unfortunately he left before I could have a word with him,  so I'm left with a yelp comment."}
{"text":"I go here once every two weeks and haven't had a problem. I've been going to this location for 8 years and they serve me fine. I don't like how the building looks, but now there upgrading it to look nicer. Sometimes in the drive through they mess up the order but it's fine if you eat inside"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem at this location until today the cashier Veronica was a complete b**** they made a mistake we went to ask him to fix it Veronica literally yank the burrito out of my suntan and slammed into the trash can totally unacceptable drive-through people are great if you go inside be careful cuz Veronica's a b****"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give this establishment zero stars that is the rating I would give it. I live right near here so if I want Taco Bell this is regrettably the one easiest to go to, and every time I give them a chance they never fail to disappoint. They consistently A. Don't get my order right or B. Give me the wrong food or forget an item I paid for entirely. I would never recommend going here unless they're giving you free food and even then I would think twice about it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible! They got my order wrong I get home the Sierra mist had no syrup in it they wouldn't replace my drink and they forgot half of my order! I get home and call Taco Bell and they refuse to replace the food that they forgot to put in my bag unless I bring back the whole order! I explained to her this is not my fault like hell am I going to have food here and not eat it right now I'm hungry that is the point of drive-through and she hung up on me. I should've got her name so that I can talk shit about her on here. I will never go back to this place it is nothing but hood rats!"}
{"text":"I am a very patient man, and I never write reviews, but this place was so bad I had to. I usually don't care about bad service once or twice, or when it's busy because I understand what it's like working these jobs. However, there have been five separate incidences, never once a good experience here.

Twice I waited at the menu board waiting to order for 20 minutes. One car in line infront of me, only a couple of people inside. I was even acknowledged on the speaker system, and then ignored again. Both times I had to drive up to the front window to get them to take my order.

Their drive through is SO SLOW. Only a few cars takes AT LEAST 15 minutes of waiting. So I said \"Hey why not, I'll just order inside instead\". I walked up to the counter and the two girls were just chatting with eachother standing at the register. Didn't even acknowledge me. I had to wave my hands and get their attention, even though I was right infront of them, and there was no line. After I got my order, I checked and saw they didn't give me any hot sauce, even though I asked for it.

The two other incidences were just the awful wait times for food. Noone inside and 2 people in the drive through I've waited up to 30 minutes twice. Management needs to take a good hard look at their employees here. Oh and speaking of management, I have never seen a manager on duty here."}
{"text":"I was having a really bad day, but a gentlemen at the drive thru was extremely patient and friendly while taking my order, and it cheered me up. I didn't catch his name, but his service was excellent. They were also very quick!"}
{"text":"Every time I order nachos and cheese they forget the nachos.. If it's not the nachos it's something else. Mixed up orders constantly. I've encountered bad service before but this place is about 5% good and 95% no idea what they are doing. I'm tired of coming in having to fix my order and then offered a free drink..

No I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"I went through drive thru and the woman who took my order was fantastic! She was enthusiastic and I felt great ordering. She repeated my order and even suggested desert items. I was highly impressed by the quality of customer service I received. And my order was exactly how I ordered it."}
{"text":"if anyone ever invites you to this taco bell, say no. that person is not your friend.  also i dont understand the people saying this taco bell is great. im a pretty big fan of taco bell but this one is trash. i first came in to see a large family of homeless children, their mother with a fully smoked cigarette hanging out of her mouth, all 5 children, dressed in torn and filthy clothes, were carrying at least two bags each of random clothes, dishes and kitchenware including a blender full of what i hope was iced tea. a very heavy older gentleman in an automatic wheelchair sat directly in front of the front door while the chihuahua-terrier mix on his lap barked at each guest as they entered. the man would then stare at each guest as if to say \"how dare you upset my dog?\" .. while i ate three other homeless looking people strolled in, one promptly asked if she could plug her phone into the outlet behind my seat. i agreed and she plugged it in, watched it charge for a minute and then laid down next to me and took a nap. the other two people who came in seperated as soon as they came in the door. the man went to the far corner while the woman strolled to the counter. the man who sat down then yelled \"beth!! .. BETH!!\" until the woman yelled out \"im over here!\" and they went back and forth like this for the remainder of my stay. keep in mind this dining room is about 12 feet by 12 feet. these people who yelled like they had lost eachother in a forest were about 5 feet away from eachother. both looked around while yelling like they were trying to see where the other had run off to. on top of all this, the soda fountain did not have a single button that supplied anything other than slightly flavored lake water. the burrito supreme had a half cruncy tortilla. not sure how they managed that one. a ups worker came in halfway through my meal, looked around and walked right back out. i advise you be like that ups worker. or even better, just avoid this place completely."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell location I've ever visited.  In particular, my visit on 01/23/17 was the straw that broke the camels back.  Drive thru window took 20 minutes with only 1 vehicle ahead of me."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service I have ever received from ANY fast food franchise.  I LOVE Taco Bell, don't get me wrong however, this particular location is horrible.  The drink station is typically a disaster zone.  The restrooms usually resemble a horror film truck stop and cry biohazard.  In regards to to the customer service, managers change often and you may or may not have one available on shift.  They seem to care about your issues but what can be done about making a change if the teens you employ don't follow directions."}
{"text":"Have been waiting in drive thru for 10 minutes and haven't moved.. I'm at least another 15 min away from ordering. It's like this every time at this location. The people who work here don't have a clue. I don't understand how this location stays open because it takes so long to get your food.

Edit: has now been 40 minutes in drive thru! This is a small town! Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Disappointed  every time I go thru the drive through ,  the lady is always so unhappy , even on a different  day .   Why?   Be great  full  you have a job!   I use to enjoy coming  to this one and getting a drink but the people  have changed . .. I go elsewhere . ."}
{"text":"They are really ghetto.  I bought their french fries supreme today and they re-fried their cold fries!!!!  They will not get another dime from me. That's not to be tolerated."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic location to grab some Taco Bell. The employees are very polite and the food is always hot and fresh. I frequent this Taco Bell and can honestly say I've never had a negative experience."}
{"text":"Horrible every time I go here rude employees and short every single meal. Never going here again"}
{"text":"My daughters love Taco Bell, so we were thrilled when a new opened up by our home. We decided that on Tuesdays, after my girls gymnastics we would get them Taco Bell to save time and as a treat since we rarely ever do fast food. 

4/5 times they messed up the order. Simple order, 2 bean burritos without onions, and two tostadas with beans and cheese only. 

My wife finally called and spoke with the manager Kevin. He said to come in the next Tuesday and he would comp the meal. 

She went in the next Tuesday and they said she would need to get the 8 tostadas they messed up and not cover any of the burritos. 

She explained that there is no way a 7 year old girl is going to eat 8 tostadas and that they won't keep for later. 

In the end they only comped the two tostadas my child could eat right then. 

My complaint isn't about the money (Taco Bell is super cheap), it's about having to drive back and forth so many times and then their horrible attitudes after they said they would correct the issue. 

At first I understood that the place was new and didn't get upset. But they have been open for months now and the manager Kevin, was flat out rude to my wife. 

We are contacting the corporate office, and will not return to this branch until we hear back. 

Even though the drive though is super slow, check your orders before you leave!"}
{"text":"Food was super fresh and hot. The decor could use an update but one of the better Taco Bell's I have been to."}
{"text":"FIVE TICKLED PINK STARS! I just HAD to write a review on the great customer service from the person who took my order and I paid, but more importantly the gentleman who gave me my food while going through the drive through tonight.  His closing remarks? \"See you next time,\" in a friendly and cheerful manner.  I can't tell you how many times I have received sub-standard service in drive-thrus; . no thank you or come back and see us, etc.  We as customers decide where to give our hard earned money and the business needs to decide if they want us to come back because we feel appreciated for giving them our business.

Now for the food. I decided to try something I have never had before, the Nachos Bell Grande; a nice plate of chips with beef, beans, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream.  They were pretty good...chips crispy, nice presentation and hot.  I also decided to order a side of guacamole.  Not the best guacamole I have ever had, but it had good flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Oh yes, let's start with the 8-12 car deep drive through line and 30-45 minute queue. Lol. Chipotle's right across the street and this place never not busy. #SMH Anyway, we all wait for a reason and that is to get our Taco Bell fix. I cannot complain about it. The Dorito locos taco supreme is well supreme! The nachos bell grande is just so grand! The chicken chalupa is divine! You get the point. Some of us love this food and Taco Bell does not disappoint! The servers are very nice as well. I had to deduct a star due to the horribly slow service, but since most of us are catching up on listening to great music or socializing via phone or physically, the time passes by rather quickly."}
{"text":"A horrible Taco Bell that finds ways to be more horrible. You could order a water and they would give you a burrito. They just can't get an order right. The food is stale, the seating area is a mess, and the customer service is non-existent. When you use the drive-they the food is thrown into the bag so expect a big mess when you get home."}
{"text":"So they ruined my Mexican pizza (see picture) and gave me 3 sauces for a Mexican pizza and 2 burritos. After she asked me how much I'd like and I said a lot. WORST FUCKING TACO BELL EVER. You will be giving me my money back. Thank you so much for that. I would give you zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous comment. This place is old and dirty!! I can't say anything wrong about the service because I don't really care about that ... Lol"}
{"text":"Poor customer service !!!! Manager sucks !!! Don't like how he just sat my food on the counter and didn't get my attention or even call my name and just had it ditto there for ten minutes like I was just supposed to know. There was other people on te place so assumed it's because they Ordered big meals and that's why I was waiting so long ."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly, however, I ordered a chips and cheese and realized when I got home, I had cheese but no chips. Very disappointed, as the chips and cheese is one of my favorite snacks from Taco Bell. Still ate the cheese, but wish I had chips to go along with it."}
{"text":"Decided to go to this location because it was closer. Asked for no sour cream, and there was sour cream. Also, they were out of nacho cheese. Second bad encounter in a row with Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Ordered a few breakfast items, got balled up and sloppily thrown together am crunch wraps. I don't expect a lot from taco bell, but this place is terrible. And when I asked for mild sauce for 2 am crunch wraps, a biscuit taco and two hash browns, they gave me 2 mild sauce packets....2. Seriously? Employees here couldn't cars less about their jobs or making customers happy."}
{"text":"Typical fast food but always good for some reason.  You can really get a bang for your buck. 

Taco Bell's Cravings Deal: Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Burrito Supreme, Crunchy Taco, Chips and Nacho Cheese and a medium soda for $5.35!!!

That's a pretty good deal.  I couldn't finish it all and shared with my buddy but when you are a budget - not a bad deal.  I have always loved taco bell since they serve pepsi too cuz I am a pepsi girl at heart! The only thing bugs me about this location is how their menu is situated at the drive thru (see picture). My eyes aren't the eyes of a young woman ok..  its tough to read from where and how its situated.   Easy in and out of this location.. . theres an exit in the back near the drive thru..."}
{"text":"I just had to try the fries..  want to see what the buzz was all about.   Decent deal $1 fries with side of nacho cheese.  It was a small amount. The fries have a little bit of season salt on them.  They were flavorful. They are probably better than some other fast food restaurants - definitely different and cooked properly.    They were good - but not life changing."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times... it's terrible but sometimes when you're too lazy to make dinner and wild rather skip going to McDonald's, I'll come here. When they first opened, the food was terrible, everything was cold and undercooked. BUT now this place is pretty great! The employees are so friendly and hilarious! I always get a good laugh going through the drive-thru! I always order the same things when I come here because I don't like experimenting with my food (especially if it's fast food!!) I always get chicken or cheese quesadilla and/or Doritos Loco Tacos the fiery flavour!!! Sometimes they give you more than 2 packets of sauce but it all depends on who's manning the drive-thru I guess. It's usually a hit and miss. But oh well... probably a good thing I lay off the hot stuff anyway. The service is pretty fast and they get your order right! Lord knows it defeats the whole purpose of going through drive-thru when you get the wrong order or if you're missing stuff! My tip for EVERYONE, check your order before you leave. It happens at every restaurant not just this one."}
{"text":"Went to this place a few days ago to have a couple of hard shell tacos and a cold drink... Not to be hustled for more money for some donation by this restaurant.  Put the donation box next to the cash register and leave it at that.   do not ask the people and try to give them a guilt trip into giving for whatever you were hustling $$$ for today."}
{"text":"Not hard to get any order right!!!! It's all on the screen! Does this taco bell only hire employees that can't read or is add sour cream and no onions rocket science???"}
{"text":"Still having to wait like 20 mins for a burrito. Reviews don't change their service. Don't come here. Slowest \"fast food\" ever."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Always a long wait. If you go I would expect to be in the drive thru for 15-20 mins. Half of the time the presentation of the food looks like the employees are just being lazy. Bad attitudes."}
{"text":"Really don't get the negative reviews on here. Best Taco Bell I've ever been to. Best, friendliest employees, always accurate order, always perfect. Taco Bell, you have my heart."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and beautiful landscaping. Convenient drive through. Very clean as well."}
{"text":"Good service. Clean and pleasant.

The order was quick and accurate. The music wasn't loud, the tables were clean. I work close by and it's a convenient stop.

Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever. I ordered chicken quesadilla and nachos. Chicken quesadilla was something they made up with fried chicken and onions with no cheese or quesadilla sauce. I had to trash it because it was gross. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Leaving this review because your cashier/drive through employee Kassidy is the most upbeat fast food employee I've ever encountered in my life. She deserves a raise. I've never met such a nice and happy person working in this industry and it really made my day encountering this employee. She even got my order right.. every other time I come here I feel like it's wrong but she listens, cares, and makes an effort to make others feel special. Best 2 minutes of my day."}
{"text":"The employee was nice and our wait time was short, which is always nice. The problem was our portion sizes. I'm no sure if it was the location or procedural. We kept seeing the commercial for the Double Chalupa and wanted to try it. Well it was disappointing to say the least. The taste was ok but it was really just a larger shell with little meat or toppings."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. Pretty good. Only issue I have with it is that unless you ask for extra beef and pay for it, you'll hardly get any beef on your food. Makes no sense. Other than that everything else is good"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience ever tonight. Customer service was absolutely horrible. Slowest speed ever. I started in the drive thru and asked for just a moment before ordering. Guy told me to take my time which ended up only being 20 seconds or so. When I spoke to try to order I did not get a response. I tried saying hello, I tried saying again that i was ready to order....silence....
I drove up to the window and two people looked at and saw me waiting. Not a word. Didn't even come to the window. I then parked and came inside to order. I've already been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting for our food. Everyone waiting in the food is now impatient. Someone said they were over 30 minutes when they got their food. The cashier told the people getting things bagged up that everyone is getting impatient and they acted as if it was a joke. Will not be returning unless they get some mature people running the show."}
{"text":"Ordered a moderate amount of food at this location, just to find that the order was wrong. Went back through the drive through to let them know and the girl on the mic seemed so put out and like she hated her job. So, I get through the drive through and pull into the parking lot to check the food. Wrong again. I go back through again, and the same girl on the mic might as well said, \"Whatever\" while confirming the issue. I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon... unless I'm drunk."}
{"text":"Update:::
So I realized they no longer call it the loaded potato griller, and that's why there's no longer bacon in it. No one told me this when we ordered. Was still too thin and flimsy to be justified. Also tried this place again and had another bad experience. When you order nacho cheese they skimp out big time and only fill it barely a quarter. Go to the one on west Charleston and town center. Way better, portions bigger, and nacho cheese was filled to the top!

We came here on Saturday and got a relatively small order. As we drove away, we noticed a couple items not in the bag. So we pulled over and went inside to avoid the drive thru line again. After pointing out the mistake, another 15-20 min later we get the items and leave. Please take a look at this flat sorry excuse of a \"loaded potato griller\". Nothing loaded about this. Its supposed to have bacon on it, but there's not. And there's only a few potato pieces, and cheese that's it. I usually come to this Taco Bell due to its location, but it's hit or miss. See photos."}
{"text":"I am extremely frustrated. So the lobby is closed but the drive thru is open. I check the hours and they say they are open till one. On the door on lobby hours it simply states that they open at 7. Currently, I have no car as a student so I must use my bike to get everywhere. Even though the establishment is fully functional, they will not serve me, a paying customer, through the drive thru because all I have is a bicycle. Well I am not ever coming here again. Put the correct hours up. Extremely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. They screwed up my order and then told me it was my fault, and gave me attitude. Re hire. How pathetic and disgusting."}
{"text":"Ordered a quesadilla, cheese was not in there, essentially I got a warmed up tortilla for $4. You have to be an idiot to forget cheese. There are two ingredients: tortilla and cheese.  I would call the number on the receipt but that doesn't get me my meal when my lunch is over."}
{"text":"I didn't get my debit card back, the cashier ether stole it or handed it out to another customer.  When the manger came out she refused to look for it, apparently at her size checking the floor under the work station was more difficult than she wanted to deal with.  She stated the only thing they can do, is call the police and have the employee searched, but when I said ok lets do that, she back tracked and refused.  I have cancelled the card of course, but it is just a pain in the butt to deal with, plus the cashier an the manager were so rude and disrespectful about it. I remember when customers were supposed to be treated with respect.  DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR CARD!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Staunch vegetarians were served meat despite mentioning \"no meat\"  clearly. What's worse is that lady does not care.  Pretty nasty customer service. Will never visit there again"}
{"text":"I just spent 8 bucks on 3 specialty burritos and all I got was 3 bean and cheese burritos. And their drive thru took forever."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This was absolutely the worst drive-thru service I have EVER experienced!!!! 40 MINUTES IN LINE! I shouldn't have even waited but it got to be almost a joke how long it was taking. How can this place stay in business? When we finally got up to the window to pay, the employee at the register asked me how I was doing. Really? I asked him why it had taken so long, and he said that they were really understaffed (yet I could see another employee behind him at the register leaning on the counter B.S.ing with someone for awhile). Based on similar reviews about the poor service, this is a regular occurrence. The manager should be fired!"}
{"text":"We walk in and there is a woman inside with a non service dog, just gross. Dogs do not belong in restaurants, im tired of people thinking they are above rules and laws. Manager is staring right at the dog, but says nothing, ridiculous!"}
{"text":"4 stars for a Taco Bell!!!  What???

I was running late to get back to work so I whipped into this Taco Bell not knowing what to get.  I was so hungry and in a hurry.  I quickly decided to try the new Cantina Burrito after I asked what was in it.  It sounded interesting.  The drive through was a little slower then I would have liked but doesn't that always happen when you are in a hurry!  The girl  working the window was very nice and smiled alot which is unusual in a fast food environment.

Now about this burrito.  I unwrapped it and the first thing I noticed is it's size.  It is huge!!!  I take a bite and my thoughts are this is interesting.  I take another and another and then I'm thinking Hey, this is really good.  So now I am curious because I can't stop eating (yes, it might have been hunger).  I get back to my office and decide to look it up online.  This burrito was created by Chef Lorena Garcia.  Inside the burrito is guacamole, citrus herb marinated chicken, pico de gallo, roasted corn & pepper salsa, romaine lettuce, black beans, cilantro rice and there is some kind of sauce which blends it all together and it works.  I loved it.  No, Taco Bell is not paying me for this review.

This may not be for everyone.  You obviously need to like cilantro.  Earlier I said it was huge.  I ate the whole thing!!!

{"text":"I normally don't write reviews about fast food places, but I just need to say that your drive thru employee today during lunch was quite rude, sorry if she doesn't like her job, but she's in customer service and she just had an overall bad attitude. Which makes me not want to go there again, to this location especially. Food is good, but the customer service is not very good."}
{"text":"The service at this Taco Bell was fast and quite pleasant.  The food was as to be expected. I did order the new Volcano Quesorito which was quite tasty and just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Taco bell, need I say more? You love it or hate it. This location was originally farther down the road by acme. The inside is much better then the old location."}
{"text":"The food is great. Unfortunately, many of the menu items have hidden extra ingredients you can choose from. The employees have a difficult job to do. Tonight, I ordered the Doritos taco..on the display it has sour cream. The cashier asked me if I wanted the nacho cheese Doritos taco..I said yea..I guess. Everything I ordered had Nacho cheese on it ..no sour cream. I can't fault the cashier, because she can't be expected to tell everyone..everything involved with each menu item. There has to be another way to make this easier for the consumer."}
{"text":"The staff at this Taco Bell location is consistently friendly and courteous. My order is always out quickly, the store is always kept clean - which you don't always see at many fast food locations. I stop in at least once a week, often two or three, depending on whether I took lunch to work or not that day. On the very rare occasion an order is slightly wrong or misunderstood, they quickly and happily make it right. Recommended."}
{"text":"I went into taco bell today Oct 28, 2015 between 2:30 and 3:00pm one by meadows mall.  I asked the cashier for two boxes of tacos with the cool ranch an mix tacos. Before I removed my food off the counter I told the manager who gave me my food and the cashier my order was wrong. Apparently they didn't care about customer service. So I want your Cooperate number because here at the taco bell you  service customers what you want, you didn't listen when I told  you the order was incorrect the tacos are not the same you telling me they are. A manager an the cashier customer service unprofessional. My incorrect order was $40 dollar's and some cents.

It's a shame I have went to Taco Bell today 10/29/2015 and spoke to the supervisor Miss Rita she was RUDE know better then the employee that was getting rid of me yesterday when I said my order was incorrect. Apparently it was a problem rita \"tells me why you didn't ask for yesterday\"  I said excuse me why your employee didn't listen and just change my order? know response, your cashier rung up what i ask for you employee should have check it again are apparently wasn't able to read that we'll. And Rita had a problem she had to stop and whisper something in another employee ear. Rita didn't apologize didn't try to fix the situation do everyone there have bad customer service? We'll I place a call to cooperate let's see what action takes place. That was money wasted and bad customer service both days

Well the supervisor don't care either one call she didn't apologized and another supervisor never return my call"}

{"text":"There is NO excuse for a restaurant to leave out food in an order. Period. Every.single.time. I have no idea why i return to this location... Other than convenience. Tonight I spent $24 to feed my family. I ordered 4 soft tacos, 2 hard tacos, 2 bean and cheese burritos w/o onion, 2 Mexican pizzas and a burrito supreme w/o onion. Of course they rush me off after a quick perusal of a dark paper sack. The guy even tells me \"the ones with no onion are marked.\" When I get home, I have 1 Mexican pizza (there goes dinner for my 9 year old), 1 bean and cheese burrito (sorry 4 y/o! Forgot your burrito too) and the burrito supreme was accurately marked to have no onion. But alas it had onion... And TONS of it as if we asked for double onion. Sorry mom... You can have cereal if you want?? Ugh. I HATE you Taco Bell. Learn to review your orders or go work somewhere else."}

but props for being the only late light food available in westlake i guess.

would change to 5 stars if offered pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"I know Taco Bells aren't great for you, but I love them. But, on that point, this one had something off with their cinnamon twists, I have no clue what was wrong with them, but they tasted wrong. They switched it out without hassle, but still tasted weird. Tacos were fine though."}

{"text":"Purposely sabotaged burrito.  My wife ordered soft tacos without lettuce and a bean burrito without onions in the drive through tonight.  The order was wrong of course, happens about 1 out of 4 times but what sets this apart is how it was corrected.  After checking the order and finding out it was wrong my wife drove back through the drive through and gave them the items back to correct.  The tacos were corrected but instead of redoing the bean burrito without onions they shoved the contents of one of the returned soft tacos, lettuce and all into a flour tortilla and rolled it up.  I'm amazed that this kind of customer service is tolerated here or anywhere for that matter.  I am through with Taco Bell and will never return."}
{"text":"Honestly not bad. Lunch time on a Tuesday, it wasn't took busy at all!  My order was even completed before I was able to fill my drink. Not bad at all. I'm only giving a one star knock down because the bathroom is pretty shady. It was clean yes just the way it's laid out if you know what I mean. You can see if someone is on the toilet..."}
{"text":"Outright sucks. They don't have the nacho fries at all. They are slow as hell. My drink was more like watered down Dr Pepper which honestly tastes nasty"}
{"text":"Slowest. Drive. Thru. Ever. I wish I read the reviews first before getting stuck in it for 15+ minutes."}
{"text":"This review is a negative 50 (-50) and I'm very upset. First off the cashier didn't seem to understand I didn't want shredded chicken tacos I wanted the other kind of chicken. Then I didn't realize 1 hard shell basic taco was damn near $2.00 like what happened. These tacos aren't all that and not real mexican food. I just didn't feel like driving to get cheaper real mexican food. 

Got my order fairly quickly but when the little bish handed me my bag I said thank you as I always do. The rude lil bish kept walking to talk to her friend that was eating in the dining room. I'm so big on customer service no matter what kind of job you have. You chose this job to work at Taco Bell so do your best working there cuz without customers you wouldn't have that job.

No disrespect to this industry but they asses crying about how they want more than minimum wage. How about stepping up your game to deserve a raise. I definitely don't make what I think I'm valued at but that doesn't mean I do a half ass job or a crappy job either. 

So here's the kicker!!! These wonderful fast food workers didn't give me 2 of my tacos!!! What kind of nonsense is this? I shouldn't have to check my food since that's their job but I knew better. I WILL NEVER PATRON OR SPEND MY MONEY HERE AGAIN!!! I could have spent my money at IN-N-OUT for alot less money that has better food with great service."}
{"text":"I am only giving two stars because of the drive through.  It is notoriously slow.  It took me twenty minutes to get through the line today with only 3 cars in front of me.  And there is no way to get out of line either.  This happens EVERY time I use the drive through."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on New Year's Eve and the manager Angie didn't give me my complete order but claimed that she did. She began getting really loud, rude, and defensive with me. The other employees were really sweet and fixed the error but the manager Angie completely ruined my desire to return to that location ever again. She truly doesn't deserve to be a manager with that attitude !"}

{"text":"Came in today just for a simple lunch got it quick and fast good service from Elaine will come back again"}
{"text":"If I can give this Taco Bell less than one star or negative stars I would.  A few different reasons made this place less than favorable. 
Reason number one. I had a large order one of the orders I specifically asked for a simple soft chicken taco. The lady taking the order repeated it several times back to me. When I got home she might wear today surprise they had given me. I am very very allergic to beef. This was strike one. 
When I return to make them aware of their mistake and simply have them fix it, it was a complete disaster. No one wanted to take responsibility for the order. And when they finally did it they were going to charge me extra. This was only strike two
At this point, as you could imagine I was furious with them. The lady shoved the bag at me. And stated \"here's your food\"
I went inside and asked for the general managers number they toss me a receipt and then just walked away. No one acknowledged that I was even standing there. I asked for a manager and they smirked and laughed.
When the manager finally approached me he did not even introduce himself. He said that I just needed to come back tomorrow and talk to then.
This was strike two
When I asked for an apology everyone at the store looked at me as if I were speaking a foreign language. It was highly embarrassing. I had to raise my voice for them to even acknowledge that I was speaking. Every time I talked they cut me off and made a condescending remark. 
One of the cooks came from the back and started yelling and cursing at me also. We got into a screaming match in the store. Very unprofessional. Very out of character for me as well.
I would never return to this place. It was embarrassing and upsetting.
I will not be returning to this Taco Bell do you to the lack of professionalism and accuracy. This was not the first time that they had gotten the order wrong. Or spoke in a disrespectful way to a customer. So sad"}
{"text":"They got my order wrong. They dropped a whole box... But I \"didn't pay for it.\" 
I order my food. I pay what they tell me. Isn't that their job!! 
Besides being short a meal- that I ordered a separate drink for!
They mild box was \"wild.\"
And no tomatoes on ONE box turned into no tomatoes for EVERYTHING.
I'll never go back"}
{"text":"This is a Taco Bell/Long John Silver's. The one star is because their Dr. Pepper is always defective, forcing me to go to the nearby Arby's when I need a Dr. Pepper to get me through the work day."}

{"text":"I have to say I have a love hate relationship with Taco Bell. I love the food and hate it when they get my order wrong! My bean burrito had some other \"bonus\" ingredients this time (a little beef and lettuce). I LOVE the Baja Blast Mountain Dew!! Hey Pepsi... did you guys put crack in the Baja Blast?? I wish I could buy it off the shelf, but alas I guess I'll continue to brave Taco Bell for my fix!"}
{"text":"Waited for 25 minutes to dine. The meat in the tacos  was  sloppy and the vegetables wet. Big mistake using the bathroom. It was disgusting. Do they ever wipe the floor and the garbage can? Definitely bad aftertaste."}
{"text":"Like DIARHEA?  Eat here often!  My son and I ordered VOLCANO TACOS in March and got sick for two days.  It gave the name volcano tacos a new meaning. Manager just gave me my money back.  Thanks Buddy!   We ate taco bell elsewhere once after that and it was ok.  I thought I would give it another try and ate a grilled stuffed buritto.
Now I am SO SICK with vomitting and diarhea. It has been 4 DAYS.   I can't go to work!!!VERY EXPENSIVE TACOS:( Dr. says SALMONELLA could last 5-7 days.
I have learned my lesson.  DON'T EAT IN A FILTHY JOINT LIKE THIS!!! SIGNED,POTTY GIRL  (INSTEAD OF PARTY GIRL)"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed and angry with the way the general manager, Jerry, treated me at this Taco Bell. He called me a liar and humiliated me in front of neighbors and customers who happened to be visiting the restaurant at the same time. He should be reprimanded for his treatment and mismanagement of a long-time customer, such as myself. 

This is the situation: Last week I placed a sizable order through their drive-thru and when I got home, two of the items that I special ordered were made incorrectly. I live about 20 minutes drive away and did not feel like going all the way back out just for two items, and in addition to the drive and gas cost, I am also handicapped and it is difficult for me to get out and go. I called the location and explained the mishap to the person on the phone who stated they were the manager, who apologized and asked if I could come back to have the items remade. I explained that it was a 20 minute drive each way and I was handicapped and would prefer not to have to go back out that late at night. The manager said no problem and told me they would write my name down so I could have the two items replaced on my next  visit. 

On Feb 13th, about a week after the initial incident, I went into the store to request my two items that were to be replaced on my next visit. After waiting for almost 10 minutes to speak to a manager, I was finally able to speak to a female manager who was clearly not the person in charge because she said she was unable to find my name in their \"book\" and told me I would have to speak to the general manager Jerry. I watched the woman I spoke with go back to making food, and I could see her speaking to a gentleman across the line from her, who I later found out was the general manager, Jerry. After she spoke to him and told him that I was waiting in the front to speak with him, he continued to make food for at least 7 more minutes before he decided to grace me with his presence. Meanwhile, I am standing in the front of the store, having issues because I walk with a cane and cannot stand for long. After several minutes and seeing that he clearly did not care if I was attended to or not, I had to sit down and wait because I could no longer stand. 

After about 7-8 minutes (17-18 total minutes from the time I entered the store and asked to speak to a manager) Jerry finally came up to the front. I explained what happened and that the female manager was unable to find my name in their book. At that point, without even looking in the \"book\" himself, Jerry said, \"I'm sorry, your name is not in the book so there is nothing I can do for you.\" I replied, \"Ok, so, are you saying that you are not going to replace my items that were incorrectly made? He responded, \"That's right!\" I was really aggravated at this point. I had stood there and waited  almost 20 minutes for this! I said, \"I am really angry that you wasted my time like this, it is the responsibility of the store to write down this information and not my fault that someone did not do their job.\" He replied, \" If it isn't in here, then you didn't call. You could be lying just to get free food for all I know. How am I supposed to know it actually happened the way you said it did?\" I WAS LIVID!!!!!!!! To make matters worse, my neighbors were standing there because they happened to be visiting the restaurant at the same time. I was furious and humiliated. I told him, \"Just forget about it, I will take this up with your manager.\" I asked for his name and left. As I was walking out the door, I turned around to see him laughing! This is absolutely inexcusable behavior for any employee, let alone a general manager!

I went home and called to make a formal complaint about this to his district manager. I hope they do something about this man! How dare he insinuate that I would lie and make up a story to get two measly food items free when I had to drive 20 minutes each way and spend at least $10 in gas to get there! Never again. As long as this man is working at this restaurant, I will never return. I can almost guarantee you that I am not the only person he has mistreated and I won't be the last. People like that have a sense of entitlement and an attitude that berates others and empowers only his own self-inflated ego."}
{"text":"customer service is good and professional.They have a pretty good food selection. And items that you can only find at a Taco Bell like the Doritos Locos Taco. I love and their cinnamon twists. I always order those because they are my favorites. Their prices are reasonable . Personally if I had a choice of McDonald's, BK, Wendy's or Taco Bell I'd go with Taco Bell."}

{"text":"Very very slow drive through. Waited way too long at the speaker.  Maybe about 15 minutes then decided it didn't work so I proceeded to exit the drive through.  Once you enter this drive through there is no way out.  I was blocked by a truck at the window for another 5 or 10 minutes.  So basically I spent at least 20 minutes in this drive through and did not get any food.  Which is OK with me but I was getting the food for my Mom who had a procedure done at Carle and was starved!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why ppl complain... this place is great. No matter what time of day, I always get a fat amount of lettuce with my meals. The ratios are always appropriate and I never feel jipped. Fast service EVERY time!"}

{"text":"I rarely complain, but this particular taco bell either takes forever, gets my order wrong or both on a pretty consistent basis. After many 2nd chances I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Once again a customer does not get what they pay for. Every time I go through the drive through and get home, items are missing. I forgot this every time until I eat home and remember why I boycotted this locations for as long as I did. How difficult is it to take two seconds to check the order before handing it off....."}
{"text":"At this Taco Bell the speaker was broke so trying to order was impossible. After ordering the service was not the best or friendly. As for as the food it was ok but forgot hot sauce ."}
{"text":"I'll have to give kudos to the crew who were working tonight at the Taco Bell at the corner of Hudson Dr. And Graham Rd. They did a great job getting the orders out. The tacos and burritos we ordered were done the way they should have been. The soft tacos were all done consist levy and had plenty of ingredients."}
{"text":"I know it's Taco Bell. Why review? Well because worst service ever. These kids have their friends in here, talking loud and inappropriate. My food took forever and it was cold."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat in the drive thru line for 20 minutes and never even ordered. This is the first and last time trying to go to this Taco Bell. There were maybe 8 cars in line in front of us when we started, we were 3 cars from the order. How it takes 20 minutes for 3 cars is beyond me. If you want fast service, go to the Mexican place down the street. It'll be better food and the same amount of time."}
{"text":"The employees handled themselves well the other night when a disgruntled employee -  Ashley loudly in a vulgar way left the restaurant in her misguided teenage angst driven meltdown. Kudos to the staff and manager for keeping a level head and providing good food and service during a clearly uncomfortable situation for them. Thanks for the good food and service. We'll be coming back and enjoyed the entertainment Ashley provided. Albeit the employees were uncomfortable but we lead boring lives and this is all the fun we ever have."}
{"text":"Yes, the drive thru line can be a long wait when the dining room closes, but most of the time it's not. And yes, sometimes they mess up your order. That can happen anywhere. But the people at this location have great customer service every single time I come here whether it's slow or busy. I've driven away many times thinking \"I love these guys\" or \"they are so nice.\" I'm giving 5 stars because I don't think this location deserves the rating that it has! Keep it up guys :)"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is my jammy jam. I recently moved to Paradise, NV to be closer to school. Two nights ago I got the craving for nacho fries and my oh my, they're phenomenal. They're a mix between doritos and the ground beef flavor or taco bell beef. It was a surprising bite and the fries remained warm. If you're looking for a place to enjoy nacho fries. This is the joint."}
{"text":"It seems weird to be writing a review for a Taco Bell but this place is awesome. Every time I have gone here, even if there are big lines, the staff was completely cheerful taking my order."}
{"text":"Have never seen such poor customer service in my life. Employees are inconsiderate and just plain rude. I could probably label myself as a Taco Bell regular (at least once a week)...this was my 1st visit to this location, and I will NEVER go back.

Drove up to the drive thru, only 2 other cars ahead of us which had already ordered. Really no one else there, saw 2 additional people inside that appeared to be waiting for their orders. Sat at the ordering speaker for at least 2-3 mins and finally had to say hello, hello??? Someone finally answered and took my order (nacho, cinnabons, lrg drink...nothing fancy). Pull up behind the other 2 cars, which are still waiting, along with the 2 people inside who were also still waiting. The 1st car gets it's order but doesn't move....then starts honking the horn and whistling as no one is acknowledging that he obviously needs something. This goes on for what seemed like a minute or so...finally the cashier comes back to help the customer. 2nd car pulls up and has to sit again and wait. Can see there are now multiple cars waiting to place their orders behind us. One guy inside still waiting for his order. Then notice a sloppy looking employee standing on the customer side of the counter inside messing around talking to what appeared to be a friend and then handed him a bag of food and returns behind the counter. Car ahead finally gets his food and leaves. Thinking FINALLY as I was planning on the \"normal\" quick courteous service we normally get and have now been stuck in this damned line for over 10 mins. Pay for my order and the cashier says \"just waiting on your 2 double decker tacos\" which I reply \"I didn't order and tacos\". I then ask if there's a mgr available, which he replies yes. I ask to speak with the mgr and I am advised I can't because the mgr is in the back making food and he (the cashier, think his name was Omar) isn't allowed to leave the window....REALLY ARE YOU F'ING KIDDING ME!!!! You were obviously not at the window when the other car was honking continuously for help. I then ask if the mgr was the guy out talking to someone in front of the counter which he replies he doesn't know. There were 4-5 employees working, all of which appeared to be male....and not one of these punks deserves to even have a job let alone be getting paid. 

There needs to be a clean sweep of all of these employees and hiring of people who actually need to work and would be happy to perform a \"job\" they are getting paid for. I know this isn't a 5 star steakhouse but come on at least have some consideration and respect for your customers or don't bother coming to work. 

WILL NEVER RETURN and I hope this message gets out to others to prevent them from the same experience and frustration.

PS: only my 2nd time ever using yelp and sad that it was for a negative comment."}
{"text":"Omg this Taco Bell closes 10 minutes early!!! WTH!???? We were in the drive thru ( with our Uber, BTW) and the lights were off and no one was around and it was 12:47!!! Grrrrr!!! This is so stupid!!!"}
{"text":"First off I went to the wrong place for my daughters dinner...she wanted another fast food's place tacos...but she let me slide.  She ordered her tacos and was satisfied, although she said she would have preferred the other place especially since they didn't have the tacos she was looking for.  I ordered the burrito supreme and the crunch wrap supreme...the burrito was OK but the crunch wrap tasted....off.  I don't know just what it was but I only ate less than half and tossed it...I was sick to my stomach within a half hour....not fun.  I am not an avid taco bell patron as a matter of fact I go quite seldom, pretty much when my wife and/or daughter wish to go but it is a very good bet I will not be accompanying them anymore."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks. They don't even bother giving you the survey, because they know what the feedback would be. This place has screwed up my order more times than I can count, especially the late crew. How hard is it to serve beans instead of beef? How hard is it to serve a hot chicken burrito? )Let me tell you, a cold chicken burrito is gross!) Apparently for these fools it's impossible. Just to be clear, I love Taco Bell. I eat there multiple times a week. So I know the difference between good Taco Bell and bad Taco Bell. This one is bad."}
{"text":"This is really the best TB I've ever been to. The staff is ridiculously polite. Orders are always perfect. Source: I eat at five different TBs weekly."}
{"text":"This is the worst taco bell!! I went through drive through and ordered a nacho bel grande with no meat.  What I was given was a tray full of nachos with about 3 tomatoes, a half of squirt of cheese and sour cream.  I guess I was out of line by asking them to put more of something on there and all I got was attitude.  Some rude ass who said his name was calvin claimed to be the manager however, he conferred with a heavy set black female who was in plain clothes who Im sure was the actual manager.  When I asked for corporate number she blurted it out very fast as if she didn't care I said I was calling.

So mr Calvin proceeds to open my food at the drive through window and began to talk over it.  He said, oh I can only add a squirt of cheese! Im like WTF!!! You mean to tell me you can't even add a little more sour cream and beans? Mind you everything was right in the center of the nachos which would only have allowed me to probably enjoy three nachos.  

Despite me asking him several times would he eat something like that or that being that I didn't get meat he could at least make my food look presentable.  IT seemed as if me, the paying customer was bothering him so I demanded a refund. Then he asked once more if I wanted more cheese! NO MANNN just give me mo money back. Ill take my business elsewhere.

I bet any amount of money that when they fix their lunch/food at work they serve themselves DOUBLE AND TRIPLE PORTIONS! 

I only gave one star because you have to pick something however my real rating is ZERO!!!! DO NOT GO HERE! THEY HAVE HORRIBLE REVIEWS FOR A REASON!!!  All of this was after being in the drive through line for more than 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Toxic Hell I have ever been to so that is saying something.

I ordered a Diet Pepsi and a Mexican Pizza. The soda tasted like the line or nozzle hadn't been clean in, well, EVER. And the pizza was thrown into the box with contents hanging out and getting on the bag and napkin. I was hungry so I started eating it anyway. It tasted like plastic. Seriously. I couldn't eat it.

I went from starving to no appetite in the matter of a few seconds.

It was that bad.

If this location shared their secrets to corporate, they'd make millions off of the Taco Bell Diet: \"Try our food and lose your stomach! Literally!\""}
{"text":"Everytime we attempt to come here they are closed. Today we arrived at 10:34 pm and all the light's were off including sign light's.  Nobody responded at the monitor too. Last time I checked closing time is 11pm. I work in retail and God forbid we close even 1 minute early."}
{"text":"We arrived at this location after attempting to go to the freedom drive location which was closed almost 30 minutes early. Yes we arrived close to closing time. We was trying to figure out what to order and a guy rudely gets on the speaker and rushed us saying have we figured out what we wanted that we have 11 minutes and that they are trying to get home.  Then gets right back on to ask if we figured it out. I find it rude. I hate being rushed."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell & just moved to Charlotte...this is my closest location... They are pretty much the worst Taco Bell I've been too & that's saying something. The employees are usually very rude. They had a nice guy working there for a little while but now I think they've just hired a bunch of annoyed teenagers led by an even more annoyed older woman. I sat in the drive-thru for 20 minutes for one chicken burrito. I was the first & only person in line, at the beginning, then there was a line of cars behind me after 10minutes of waiting. At that point, Annoyed Teen #1, opened the window (after taking me money in the first minute), and she said, \"what did you order?\" I was shocked...I told her the single item I ordered & she disappeared for another 5 minutes. At this point I said screw it & knocked on the window where the older annoyed woman appeared. I asked if I could just have my money back so they could focus on the other cars in line. 
After a few more minutes they gave me back my money with no apologies & I have not and will not go back to that Taco Bell ever again. And that sucks because I love Taco Bell and it's the closest one but I guess I'll just learn how to cook my own tacos."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food but I've been in line for 20 minutes. I'm not sure they have food. I mean I know it's Saturday & they're busy but I've been 2nd in line for...according to my clock 13:45min...& have yet to move one inch. This Taco Bell/KFC is less than."}
{"text":"Good luck even getting an order in. Waited for the drive through for 10 minutes after ordering, and I was the second car. Eventually just left. Car in front of me had to have been for much longer than that."}
{"text":"While the 90's may be wanting their dining room back the kitchen staff rages on producing delicious food. Everything I ordered tasted great and came up promptly. The staff must be well trained or must eat a lot of Taco Bell because they were very knowledgeable about the different menu items.
I read the comments about the bathrooms being dirty but that wasn't my experience at all. Both times I have stopped in I have used the restroom and it's been clean."}
{"text":"Bad experience, today.  Sat in drive through for 10 minutes in line to order a drink and two side orders of chips and quest.  After order was placed, sat for another 5 minutes.  No \"hello\" or pleasantries, just handed me a bag.  When I drove out, I looked in the bag and only queso was included, not chips!  Two small containers of cheese in a bag!  Got out of my car and came inside to ask for chips, and waiting additional 5 minutes.  Employees need some energy and pep, because they seem tired and slow.  This was all at noon lunch hour, so management needs to get people motivated, here."}
{"text":"This place was so friendly. Stopped in this afternoon while out that way. The food was fresh and good better then the ones by my house and the service was quicker and friendlier. 
I told them that their was a stopped up toilet in the ladies room and they addressed immediately. Server even as he was cleaning up the dining room asked how our food was - that's never happened to us before at any other location. 
Kudos to the employees and management."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst lunch I've ever taken my family too. screaming kid for over 40 minutes asked one employee then a second employee, even spoke to the manager and the manager literally walked away from me and blew me off. only after I  yelled did anyone finally decide to come out. As a manager are responsible for your establishment. You are responsible for keeping the resturante in order. If you have children running around improperly supervised and screaming you are responsible for stopping that, not ignoring the other patrons who have asked politly to stop te situation. We dumped our food and left."}

{"text":"I normally regard Fast food as well..... fast food! Generally the food is consistent between restaurant locations unless something is pretty off. I also don't normally review fast food restaurants for this reason but this location is the exception tonight. 
First of all I will start with why. In the past five mos or so I have noticed that some of the TB locations have not been as customer service oriented nor as friendly. Again, I have actually and sadly come to expect this from fast food locations. 
Tonight the crew working at this location was very pleasant and outgoing! They were patient, fast and courteous. Additionally THEY asked me if I needed any condiments.( If your asking why that is such a big deal, its because most of the locations now do not ask you if you need condiments. I expect fast food orders that have food which is generally paired with condiments to have condiments provided automatically.
 When they don't just put them in there or I have to remember to ask i generally end up pulling around the side and having to go into the location to go get them. Sorta defeats the purpose of drive through. I inquired about this at one location and they said it was to save money and it was the customers responsibility to ask \" its policy\". 
I am huge on customer service so you can imagine how this went over! I haven't been back to the other location in years even though I am near it at least three times per week. 
So when this location asked they scored a huge smile from me. Additionally I got home and found that they had given me a little extra! Yay for the times when I go to a location that doesn't provide them, it will save me at least one return trip. Last but not least the order was accurate. 
Crew on duty tonight really had their stuff together."}
{"text":"This location has filled three orders for me in their drive through. Unfortunately two of three times the order was incomplete. They also don't ask customers in drive through if they would like condiments. Apparently it is a new company policy that the consumer must ask for them and employees aren't allowed to ask you if you would like them according to the manager I spoke with. This often leads to drive through customers having to go back to the store or go in side after going through the drive through just to get hot sauce if they forget to ask for it. 

Orders with only two or three items should be easily filled and easy to complete. Probably will not return due to issues with this."}
{"text":"My Wife and I went to this restaurant about a week ago and were treated very poorly. When I complained to their website, I received no response. We have a choice, and if Taco Bell cares nothing about their customers, we will never go to Taco Bell again. We have a Dell Taco closer to our house anyways."}
{"text":"Two bean burritos with no onions and two taco supremes. It's been my go to snack for 25 years. I love Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"For being a regular at this Taco Bell, I've never experienced any bad customer service. Everyone that works here is very professional & really nice. 

My friends & I came to the drive-thru this past Monday night, and Juanita who was working the window was so awesome! Great attitude & vibe. Thanks Juanita!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible when it comes to drive tru, I've been waiting in line to grab my food almost 30min now, isn't drive tru supposed to be a grab and go!? Worst choice of the day!"}
{"text":"This is the tiniest bean burrito I've ever seen. I've ordered bean burritos from Taco Bell for years, but never got anything quite like this."}
{"text":"The drive thru workers are always so polite! This location has never once messed up my order and that's awesome. The wait is usually minimal and they're quick to apologize if it takes a bit longer."}
{"text":"Someone needs to train the staff there regarding the definition of \"fresco.\"  Twice now, I've had drive-through orders made incorrectly because an employee didn't know that \"fresco\" means NO dairy products. I only live 1/2-mile away from this store, but having to go back to get this corrected greatly diminishes the experience they probably want me to have. Yesterday, after I returned my food for a refund, I actually heard the employee ask one of his coworkers, \"Oh, so 'fresco' doesn't have any cheese?!\" That's a big problem. He should already know this if he's on the food assembly line! I'm fortunate in that I don't have dairy allergies, I just don't eat the stuff. But it's only a matter of time before someone gets ill. 

On the plus side, staff is very cordial and polite."}
{"text":"If you are looking for taco's that have about 1/3 of what they are suppose to have in them, this is your place! Wrong orders and very unreliable. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a poorly run taco bell. Slow, very slow no crazy slow est. Hire an extra hand part time for the lunch rush. I might start ordering on the drive thru line and bringing it back in to eat inside. If you order in you will wait, wait and wait. Order at 12:10 pm and you are lucky if you get it by 12:25 pm or past that. I probably waited 30 minutes one time. I have an hour to kill but good God man have you no mercy? The place is messy inside I always have to wipe my table / seat off. Sometime you stand at the register ready to order and nobody comes over or someone making the food has to holler at the person who should be tending the counter to get up there to take the order. I order like a pro, give me this, make no alterations, say for here, my name is this and have my credit card ready in hand to pay NO CASH I make it so easy for them and I still have to repeat everything I said because the worker is so unable to compute more than one thought at a time, lay of the herb bro. Also, skimpy so skimpy I can get a $1 breakfast burrito at McD's that embarrasses the size of a chicken burrito at Taco Bell how the heck is a burrito flat and barely contain anything in it. It is the same guy who makes them that needs to be trained better. I like when he has the day off or is on break when I am there. Sadly this place is always packed! It is the closest one to my work I avoid it sometimes and go to other places. I would go almost every other day if they did it right? Take an order correctly, make it right and do it in a somewhat reasonable time, 7 minutes or so not 20 or more. A 5 layer burrito is not 3 layers or burrito shell folded over 3 times plus barely anything else! I should have taken pictures, it has happened 10 plus times and even when it is not horrible it is still sad."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole the customer service at this tbell is awesome! This is my neighborhood Taco Bell, and by far the friendliest one I've ever been too. (And I'm a Taco Bell addict so that says something). Well my man and I decided on another Thursday night grubbing at our favorite place, and we hit up the drive-thru as per usual. I decided to go for a boss wrap, a first time for me. The wait was pretty long, but not unreasonable and the staff was really apologetic. They even gave us a 50% coupon for our next visit--SCORE!! We also discovered they gave us a few free bags of chips too. So we get home to discover those weren't actually free chips, but an order that entirely was not ours and yes, that means that also the boss wrap was nowhere to be found! So we headed back and opted for the inside option to explain what happened. Not only did they once again become truly apologetic, but they made our correct order right away and refunded me! That's right, free food! It was honestly so sweet, and totally unexpected to be honest. I just really wanted my boss wrap and they went above and beyond. So when you're deciding where to grub, I highly recommend this establishment. In my opinion, the greatest Taco Bell in all the land! (PS the boss wrap was amazing!)"}
{"text":"Possibly the best service I've ever had at a Taco Bell. Or fast food joint for that matter. And it's close to midnight. Unheard of. This Taco Bell should be the flagship for the rest of the taco bells. Corporate should pay attention to the store."}

{"text":"Dear Taco Bell, 

Tonight I really wanted a bean and cheese burrito with no onions. It's what I always order. I went through your drive thru and gave my order to the overly friendly cashier that you hired. He even repeated it back to me. Your nifty electronic screen had my order correct as well. 

Once I got home, I was very disappointed when I bit into my burrito only to taste what seemed like extra onions! 

Aside from being allergic to them, I cannot tell you how much I dislike onions. I instantly spit it out. I opened the burrito up and sure enough, they added extra onions. 

I would have went back, but my boyfriend quickly informed me that I shouldn't be mad at you nor should I have such high expectations for you. Personally I don't think excluding onions is a difficult task. It's not rocket science. 

On other occasions, I've ordered the 7 layer burrito from this location. It's never correct. It's as if you just throw all of the ingredients in a big pile on the tortilla and then fold it up. No bueno. 

You never used to be this way. Despite my dissatisfaction tonight, I'm giving you 3 stars because you once were good to me. Not sure what changed. 

In conclusion, I won't be seeing you again. I think your workers might be high... or something. I'm very disappointed. 

-Sincerely 
Sad Customer"}
{"text":"This place has always sucked-Tried again and guess what it still sucks! Bad food! Cold, small portions They should get rid of it not rebuild it!"}
{"text":"Wow I forgot how great Taco Bell is. I never realized they had so many zero calorie options on their menu. You might say What Taco Bell has zero calorie options you are crazy. To which I say no sir just about everything on their menu is zero calories because once you throw it up after you eat it you don't absorb any calories.
I am sorry I don't usually rank on a place this bad but this was really bad. I am sure some people just love it but not this person. The staff seemed nice enough. Although it seemed like the guy on the registers second day on the job. Also when you just stuff the napkins still inside the wrapper in the place where the napkins go and tear open the end that is not really refilling the napkins. Just saying.
The food is tasteless and horrible. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog because the ASPCA might come after me. I know that is harsh and I am being mean to get a laugh but this is the worst kind of fast food. It gives fast food a bad name. I don't even dare call it Mexican food because it is so far away from real Mexican food it has never even met real Mexican food. Real Mexican food would beat up Taco Bell food if they crossed paths.
Like I said I know people just love Taco Bell but as for me I will try, shouldn't be that hard, to never eat here again. Sorry Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We just had one of the best fast food experiences ever at this restaurant! SUPERIOR customer service!! Very clean too. Keep up the good work :-)"}
{"text":"I know that no one goes to Taco Bell expecting the best food, the greatest of tastes. You're going to Taco Bell because you want something cheap, tasty, and bad for you. I've been to many taco bells. BUT HOLY SHIT. This Taco Bell takes the cake on bad quality. I usually drive by after work to grab a cheap burrito because nothing else is open at 11:30 pm besides McDonald's on the way home. 
It usually takes 15 + minutes to get through the drive through, over 1/3 of the time they get your order wrong, and it's just bad service. I know not many people strive to work late nights at Taco Bell but this is consistently the worst service from fast food I have ever received."}
{"text":"Very disappointed the whole family watching TV so I told my kids to buy dozen of taco for snack when I open it wow taco don't look like taco look like quesadilla like nothing inside I remember one time when I'm driving back from LA I stop by lenwood California and the only open is DELTACO I order 3 taco but when I open it lots of cheese and lettuce not like this Taco Bell not even half of this definitely this is my last taco bell"}
{"text":"I absolutely love taco bell but this taco bell I will NEVER GO BACK! I was with my mom since we were in the area decided to get some lunch.. we went though the drive threw ..  I ordered 2 bean burritos with Sour Cream and guacamole..and than I ordered a medium mountain Due than a 5$ lunch box.. My mom ordered 2 tacos..When we were talking too the girls though the intercom she was talking in spanish when we were trying to order our food.. i had to keep repeating myself.. I was loosing my patience than she finally says.. well do u want to speak in I go.. OMG! yes please.. than i give her my order.. we pull around.. we waited like 7 min for our food..finally got our food.. i look and they forgot too five me my mountain Due..I like someone please let this end.. UGH! so i had to go inside and ask for my drink..she was like well u didn't order it.. and I told them i ordered my drink when I was in the drive though. I looked and at my recite.. she didn't even add my mountain Due..I was loosing my patience.. so i just took the drink from the combo that the box comes with a fountain drink...didn't want too argue.. nobody spoke really good engish there also.. I had a horrible experience.. I will NOT be returning too that Taco Bell.. I give them 2 star.. nobody was friendly.. not til I left.. I could have better service..  but it was at a nice location.. really easy to spot though... that's about it.. So Taco bell u could have Done BETTER!! I had better service in other taco bells.. All can say that I hope u treat the next customer better.."}
{"text":"This is a weird complaint, but I absolutely hate when I can taste dirty tap water in food. Everything I had from this Taco Bell had a lovely City of Mesa aftertaste."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food or me directly. I was at this location today and ordered a combo meal and gave my name as I was asked. The lady behind me ordered same combo meal; mine was to go and hers was a eat in order. The young girl called my name. I went to get it and as I was headed to get a drink I heard my name a 2nd time. When I turned around the younger girl was explaining to her manager that I already got mine and this manager got nasty, rude and LOUD with this young employee. Yelling at her and repeating the same thing over and over about how she had asked the young girl which order it was and how the younger girl never told her anything and now they had to take an order out of a bag and put it a trey...REALLY?!?!?! Are you serious?!?! Come on people make mistakes. No one was offended except this \"leader/manager\" that should be trying to help this young lady deal with difficult customers instead of being afraid of a jerk boss. Oh and I called that store directly and talked to a manager."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Bell! The employees are always friendly in the drive thru and inside. The food always comes out fast (though I do notice they tend to get the drive thru taken care of before those of us who come inside) and the food is always tasty.

What makes this my favorite is the folks who work there. Every time I go through the drive thru, I am amazed by how friendly the girls are who work the menu. With good service at a good price, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell and have visited this branch of the franchise many times but as of recently the productions quality of the food has dropped dramatically and today pushed me over the edge. All of my burritos lacked the usual sour cream and buffalo sauce and was terribly wrapped, and I might've expected it from the drive through but I took the time to go in with friends and this is the put out they show the world to reflect the brand. 
I love Taco Bell but I HATE this branch recently, they Better step up their game."}
{"text":"Food has gone way downhill even for taco bell, this is the edge piece of my chicken doubledilla"}
{"text":"I like going to this location my food is always correct, the person who works drive thru window is always friendly and funny. Toda when I went through I asked for a moment to look at the menu the guy cracked a joke said take your time im here til 3..lol then when i was at the window he asked what sauce i wanted i stated none he was like well i didn't want you to have none of my sauce anyway. These little things can help add to your day, instead of being transactional he was friendly and provided excellent customer service. The last time i was there one of the girls was equally as friendly, great customer service is what makes customers want to come back. I like their menus change and their box meals are reasonably priced"}

{"text":"The cashier was so nice, he was making recommendations of his favorites, and telling us which combos were the best deals :) Nice kid who likes his job!"}
{"text":"Worst fast food experience ever! 
1. The drive thru took 25 minutes! That isn't fast food!
2.  We ordered no sour cream on anything... Everything had sour cream on it.
3.  We ordered 10 total items including 2 big BOX meals. ALL 10 items were stuffed into 1 small bag with all the sauce packets and napkins.  Everything was squished, soggy and cracked.  Why is it advertised as box, yet they put it all into a tiny bag? 

We won't be going back to this location.  It was a waste of $18."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell was too good the customer service was great and I love the way they wrap the bean burritos they even included onions most the time I go to Taco Bell they forget about the onions on the bean Burrito."}
{"text":"Had very good experience today, cashier was Rick, he knows his taco bell foods and makes great recommendations! Would have given 5 stars but i wanted breakfast and sadly this site does not participate in the breakfast program."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service! The food is prepared fast and is good. Always consistent. LOVE Taco Bell!!!"}
{"text":"This place was filthy to the point I was concerned about my food. 

From no hand soap in the bathroom to floors that were several days sticky."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, but this one is HORRIBLE it's a guaranteed mess up on every order and if you inform them of THEIR  MISTAKE they are rude. ESPECIALLY crystal. FYI if you give the food back and ask for a refund they won't do it. Should have went to firehouse!"}
{"text":"Staff was simply delightful when I got food here. Quite surprising for fast-food, I know. My food was delicious as well!!"}
{"text":"let me qualify this as I think the food is a 5, the people there are pleasant, but the time to get you food is about a negative -50. I have NEVER consistently waited as long at a fast food place as this Taco Bell location; on a good day about 5 min's to get to the register and then 10 min's after that if ur lucky to get ur food.

Which is a shame because as I said, food is GREAT there and the folks are nicer than you'd expect in a Taco Hell (pardon the pun) and the area of town it in. But you friggin' wait FOREVER for food...today i got in line at 1:16 and got my food at 1:45, in a to-go bag i asked them for because after a 1/2 hr wait I'd burned thru my ability to sit down and eat lunch. I've called their corp. office several times over past 6 mo's w/no change I can see in service.

 I am not going there again any time soon and unless you got 90 mins for lunch and a book to read, you shouldn't either"}
{"text":"One of the most clean taco bells I've been to. Actually ate in. Which is weird. I never eat in Taco Bell. Matter of fact , I was looking for Subway! Ended up here. Was greeted kindly when I walked in.  It wasn't cause I'm good lookin. They did this to EVERYONE!!! Food was fresh too, nope, this wasn't someone else's order, it was made for ME."}
{"text":"Bean Burrito, 5 layer Burrito, an iced-tea.
$5.  Sounds great to me.
Tasty meal.  Clean environment. 
Waited 5 minutes before anyone even spoke to me.  That's why only 4 stars."}
{"text":"When I entered the Taco Bell I wasn't greeted at all. When I ordered I didn't even know if the cashier got my order recorded. I waited for 20 minutes before I finally got somebody's attention and asked if my order was coming out soon. They told me my order has already been handed out so I didn't really know what to do from there. Then they got me my order after about 25 minutes of waiting. Overall very poor experience. Food was still good. Soda machine was definitely not working right. Every drink tasted horrible"}
{"text":"Taco Bell has really been pimping out their Happier Hour specials with the rolled tacos and $1 drinks. Figured it was a safe spot to grab a late lunch/snack to share with my BF, as we'd planned on a late dinner.

Ordered two of the tortilla rolls and a medium Baja Blast, and was really confused when my total came to $6. Figured maybe I was early for the HH pricing or had missed fine print somewhere. Order was out quick via drive thru.

And when I pulled up at home I realized the mistake. Somehow my order was doubled to two of each of the two tortilla rolls, and a nacho wrap was thrown in. A little frustrating, since that now made a gigantic amount of food instead of a snack, and I hate wasting.

But then I tried the food. And the nacho wrap was about the only thing that was edible. The tortilla rolls were two different types: a chipotle chicken flavor that was somehow just a couple of grilled chicken pieces and a ton of sour cream, then a chili cheese fry flavor that had spicy chili in an amount that seemed like it was trying to cover up the fact that the potatoes were burned. And oh yeah, there was no cheese. Weird.

The Baja Blast was just meh. I'm not a caffeine fan and for some reason I thought this drink was more of an Icee/Slurpee, but it's just a flavored Mountain Dew. 

Even with the order being butchered and the food being subpar, I didn't expect my stomach to hurt afterward. Yet it did... and from the other reviews here, that seems to be a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"Be careful if you are vegetarian and order from here.  The last two times they didn't follow my order and I got a chicken burrito instead of a veggie one.
Very disappointing.  If you order the normal stuff and are flexible about what they actually give you then the staff is pretty nice and it's not that bad. It was a guilty thing for me anyway so I'm going to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I sat at the menu for 5 mins without a word. Sat behind a car for another 7, just to leave and go elsewhere. Never again. Always some bs at this location"}
{"text":"Even though this location just opened I can see some major improvements the dining room was not even clean it was so discussing that you were afraid to eat in. 

The tables were not cleaned or wiped down the floor needed to be swept oh and the drink station don't get me started but it needed major attention. Oh nothing looked presentable to the customers 

   Oh wait there more the first thing you notice is not a clean property the entrance feels like something going on inside that poor management. After my experience I will be taking my businesses some where else. Thanks Taco Bell for the wonderful experience I had that I won't return or work for Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Josh needs to be trained in customer service skills."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd find myself writing a review for Taco Bell but here I am. The ONLY reason I am writing one is whoever is training the staff at this location does an amazing job with their customer service skills. They are always extremely polite and always answer in 'yes ma'm or yes sir.' You can't find that anywhere let alone a Taco Bell that mostly staffs people under 25 years old. 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this taco Bell. The first visit last year was a disaster. I stood in line and no one was there to take my order.. I left after 2 mins. Nobody cares..

Second visit was today. things have improved.. employees actually working and taking orders.. however they don't sell Loaded Grillers at this location.. and who knows what else... So had to order something else.

Food was made fresh and tasted okay but my stomach protested a tiny tiny bit.. not sure if it was the cheese or something else.

The bathroom was the dirtiest taco Bell bathroom in the history of taco Bells.. and I have been to many. I'm going to guess this might have something to do with some of their clientele..."}
{"text":"While sitting in the drive through, watched a lady with gloves on open a box, pull out taco shells (open, not wrapped) and set them on top of another cardboard box then move boxes around with the same gloves on, then carry away the shells.  Seems pretty unsanitary to me.  Those boxes could have been in the floor or who knows where."}
{"text":"I've never had problems at this location. Usually there's a line of cars but it goes fast. The service is good and the food is good.  It's definitely a great option if money is tight or your in a time crunch."}
{"text":"I stopped in this location the other day on my way home from a service call. I have never had a reason to complain about Taco Bell in all the years I have been going to them so this one gets 5 stars. I will mention that the ice machine had a sign saying \"out of ice\" and I never realized how important it is to have ice in a fountain drink."}

{"text":"I probably come here three nights a week and every time it's the same thing and I know someone's probably going to say if it's that bad why do you still go. And it's because I love Taco Bell LOL but I'm going to go ahead and take that advice and never come here again. I come here so much and I don't think I've ever had a correct order. It's almost like a running joke with me and my friend every time we comes through the drive-thru line was that we have to check our bags before we leave and every time we're missing food or it's the wrong food. I mean every time.  That is just ridiculous. Tonight I went through the drive-thru and they got my order wrong three times in the same visit. All I ordered was a gordita crunch meal that comes with two tacos no lettuce I get my food I leave the drive thru there's a gordita crunch that has lettuce on it and no tacos. I go back to the drive-thru line and give them the food back and they give me back some kind of bean burritos? LOL I said I was just missing two tacos no lettuce and a gordita crunch no lettuce so they took the food back again and gave me I'm not even sure what it was. I'm not sure if I'm getting punked or if this is some kind of joke but I'm done. This has seriously been over the course of a year I think it's time we part ways Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Not only did the staff improperly make my order when it was marked clearly and correctly on the receipt, but they did not remake my order after 40 minutes of waiting, and asking the employee twice when my food would be ready. It eventually got to the point where I could no longer wait, so I asked for a refund. The sales associate had taken my receipt when I first reported my order as incorrect and had thrown away my receipt."}
{"text":"So it's taco bell... I mean. We all know not to expect fine dining. I went through the drive through one morning to pick up an AM crunch wrap. I was greeted by a very friendly young woman who was polite and very sweet. My food came fast, she got me hot sauce, and bid me good morning to start my day. It put me in a good mood she was so cheery for 7:20 am. Made my day. She did not forget napkins and even left a mint in the bag."}
{"text":"For drive thru only the Asian guy has any idea what he's doing. The rest are super slow. Food is still good. Can get a little crazy and you can wait a while at the drive thru sometimes."}
{"text":"This is the longest wait I have ever had at to get wait at a taco bell. They gave me a discount because of the absurd amount of time that I had to wait. 
 She failed to give me my receipt so I have no way of knowing what the discount was or what the discount was said to be for. I will never be returning to this establishment and may rethink going to any of the franchises."}
{"text":"Very happy with service today, tried the new fried egg taco, and its delicious! Egg lovers rejoice, taco hit a home run with this item! Also dont forget about an A.M Crunchwrap, they are wicked addicting."}

This is the 5th time my boyfriend has tried to order his meal & drives home (15) min to find out it's wrong!  They won't give u the $ back but not even IM Sorry or here is a free meal for next time so you come back?? Again they DONT CARE. It's Taco Bell go to another. We are calling the head manager to tell our story as well......most likely won't care either."}

But this business is horrible in the evening!!My mom went there this evening and she ordered me a nacho fry's box with an extra taco and they gave me a bag with cheese spilt in it and barely any fry's my food was also cold and they forgot the extra taco and still charged my mom for it they were complete JERKS!!! I'm Never giving my business or my mom's here ever again!!!! Thanks a lot Taco Hell!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and clean store.  I haven't been to a Taco Bell in over a decade and I was pleasantly surprised.  A great option for a fast meal."}
{"text":"I appreciate great customer service and tonight through the drive-thru of this taco bell Erieyana displayed the best customer service I have ever had at a taco bell. I could tell she was overwhelmed with the fast paced Nature but she held on and worked her job with a smile... It gets easier over time trust me :)... I had to wait a little longer for my food but it was worth the wait my food was fresh and full of ingredients... I appreciate you for loving your job and doing it with a smile even though it can get heavy at times... Keep up the great work and your manager is a great associate, knowing when things need to be taken care of. Thank you for the great experience and like I told you work hard as keep it up! You will go far!"}
{"text":"If you thought that you could have worst diarrhea than normal Taco Bell, think again. 

This Taco Bell not only consistently does not have beef but it constantly turns the fryer off before closing time which is unfortunate for half the menu. Way to go franchise owner and managers!

Not to mention the cleaning supplies on the counter and no regard for hygiene. Ironic?

Yay Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is a joke rudest staff I've ever had to deal. First the person who took our order couldn't seem to figure out a basic order and gave the rudest look like it was a burden and these people want $15+ and hour. Then after getting the food did a simple check in the bag to see if everything was in the bag and just got the eye from the girl who took the order and I'd assume her manager maybe? Either way rude as heck!"}
{"text":"They just had their grand reopening. The outside is painted different colors and the inside is a more modern, updated look. I like that they have a long high top table now! All of the seats in the place are wooden, which is super uncomfortable but it's Taco Bell, so I get it. 

My go to order is a cheesy gordita crunch, chips & cheese and Cinnabon delights. The cheesy gordita crunch is basically a hard shell taco, with a thick soft taco wrapped around it , with cheese in the middle. There's a special sauce on it too...I think that's considered gordita sauce. The Cinnabon delights are pretty yummy. They are little balls of dough, rolled in Cinnabon, with warm icing in the middle. 

I've never had issues with this location. I don't recall a time when they have forgot any items in my order, so I rated them 5 stars for a Taco Bell...but before I could submit this, I saw they didn't put any cheese on my tacos today."}

{"text":"I came in to get something to eat for my fiancé and my self . I ordered a Quesadilla and a soft taco and my boyfriend ordered bean burrito sour cream and a nacho griller. When we got home we ate it and no more than 30 minutes went by with us both feeling completely gross throwing up and other in the toilet. I suggest if you want Taco Bell go anywhere else because to me it's a little odd that we both got sick 30 minutes after eating our food."}
{"text":"We order two spicy bean tostadas today and they only have five tiny pieces of lettuce and 7/8 tiny shreds of cheese . Lots of sauce and the sauce just ran of the shell. (Should just call it a saucy tostada shell) I am a Taco Bell addict and I love TBell but today wasn't the best."}
{"text":"It may be Fast food but they are the best Taco Bell period in the area.  They actually Put heart into there work.  The chili cheese tastes better here you can tell they care about temperatures and portions.  The mexi melts are worth the extreme price here.  The Service... is my favorite part they smile and look eager to see you.  I always love going here and we go regularly.  What an amazing experience."}

The employees at this location are super duper friendly. Like, really friendly."}
{"text":"Being that this Taco Bell is shared with a KFC you would imagine this being a fast food diner's dream, right?...Wrong! This place is responsible for the worst fast food experiences I've ever had! Being that this is the only Taco Bell anywhere near Solon, we have been forced to endure punishment from this location time and time again. Not only have we waited inside and in the drive thru for around 20 minutes for our food on multiple occasions, they almost always either forget a food item,  leave essential ingredients out of a food item or give you food all slopped together with broken shells and upside down Mexican Pizzas. Excuses could be made if the place was busy, however, there is usually never anyone in line! 

On one occasion we waited over 5 minutes in the drive thru for a simple order and watched it sit there as the cashier was chatting away in the background. Finally we honked the horn to get her attention. She asked if we had paid yet and we said no. We give her the money and she walks away into the distance until we knock on the window to tell her we still need our food! As this disaster is taking place, my eyes are glued on the sign inside that reads something along the lines of \"TREAT EVERY CUSTOMER AS IF THEY ARE A SECRET SHOPPER!\" Clearly this message has zero impact on the staff. Speaking of staff, who is running the shifts in this place?!

In summary, unless you have extreme patients, avoid this place at all risk!"}

Then she can't figure out how to spell JESSICA. Then she's rude to my sister and throws her change at her. Guess that's why you work at Taco Bell Stephanie no people skills. I would like to add that this Stephanie looks like she hasn't showered in about a week. Working around food she should have her hair bushed and clean."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Taco Bell so we come 2 times a month at least. After today's visit we will make the drive to a different Taco Bell. Katrina R was our cashier. She was being very friendly with the people in front of us but when it was our turn she just looked at us. No hello how are you or what can we make for you. NOTHING just a dead look on her face. We ordered 3 different slushees she did walk over to make sure it was working. But 2 minutes after ordering the machine is \"broken\" so we paid 2 bucks a pop for slushees we didn't even get. All our taco shells were stale like they have been sitting out for days. I laugh because on the bottom of the receipt is says hiring now dreams do come true! Ya what a dream job to be rude at your customers screw them out of money and make more than our police and firefighters."}
{"text":"I ordered my food without onions and the cashier told me that my order has no onions in anything I ordered. So I get my food and there were onions in my food. I am highly allergic to onion so I'm glad I checked before I ate my meal. I don't recommend this place to anybody. They should make the staff know the menu and if they are not sure then they should ask or be in back till they know the menu."}

Manager comers through talking about shift changes and does not say anything about the front. I stood up at the front for at least 10 minutes. While an employee clocked out in front of me with no acknowledgement. Finally after waiting the excuse was I thought someone was going to help you.... Everyone was doing nothing the line empty drive through empty. This location is shit for customer service. I do appreciate the one employee that acknowledged me but by then I was done. Will not come back."}

I am not a fan of Taco Bell but today was the special for $5.00 taco box.  what a joke.  spent $11.00 and got 5 tacos and one nacho.   Ordered two specials .  How do you screw up two specials. no receipt and the old lady at the drive through spoke no english.  Tried to call and no answer.  who ever is Owner or manager absolutely sucks.

Two days later I walk in asking for the manager and explain what happen DAVE the acting manager said my name was not  in his little book and he couldn't help me!!  My original order was 3 taco supreme. What that gave me was a soggy tostada soggy nachos and some other crap I didn't recognize!!!  I'll Never eat at this taco bell again.  Way to go Dave!!"}
{"text":"This happens to be one of my favorite taco bells in the area! The customer service is always top-notch and it even emits a sort of family feeling every time i go inside. The area is not to great but i do enjoy how the store is maintained; heck even the trees outside are well kept, and they look like bells! Now let me tell you why I enjoy this Taco Bell more then others. It typically is not to busy there so it lets you have some privacy and due to the not-so-much-business (unfortunately and not so at the same time) it makes my orders taste really fresh! Every time I go there I usually get 2 beefy 5 layers and i will get them grilled, and so far they are the best at grilling them out of any other Taco Bell that i have been to. Unfortunately the reason i have to give 4 instead of a 5 is for 1, that the drive-thru doesn't work to well, which isn't the employees fault, however it does deter me to go there when I'm trying to be quick, and 2 sometimes it's not the cleanest, but that was probably because some people had just left when i got there. Besides those things this one of my favorite Taco Bells to go to."}
{"text":"As far as surprise goes, best tacobell hands down, the cleanest too. The beefy nacho grillers are fire"}
{"text":"The taco bell experience is irritating to say the least. 

They're food is up to par with taco bell standards, but the service and the quality of the employees is not.

Employees are polite, but often times forgetful. Sometimes they forget multiple items at a time, turning a peaceful night eating in with the family into a very angering experience with often times another trip back to taco bell to pay for the items they forgot to include in the bag and on the receipt.

However, the food is very good. The employees put a lot of time into the food by fast food standards. You can tell they didn't just take the stuff off a warming tray like mcdonalds. They actually take the time to cook the food and put quality into it. Which is in and of itself a redeeming quality for this store.

Edit: There is no Wifi in taco bell. So if you're planning on doing a little business on your laptop while eating, find a mcdonalds or a Panera."}
{"text":"I have been to this Taco Bell a few times since moving out to the southwest side of town. I L-O-V-E me some Taco Bell. 

I love that they are open late for when I get off work, the guy that works the overnight shift is pretty funny. I ordered a Mexican pizza meal last night and he asked if I would be upset that they did not have any? I told him no it was fine, I love everything on the menu. He said your supposed to get anger and yell \"oh I am so mad, gurrr\" \"ok I am so mad(with a smile)\" he said no we have them. 
I think the overnight shift needs to have some fun, it's a boring shift. Way to make it fun taco man!"}
{"text":"Food tasted great! But I'm more focused on the worker that managed the drive thru. Her name is Lillie (tried to peep at her name tag), and she was super friendly to me and my fiancé. Also the fact it was 1am, she was super kind and just lovely. She did an EXCELLENT job, and was an absolute blessing. Get this girl a promotion because she earned it!"}
{"text":"I echo the sentiments of those that spoke about the quality of customer service you get here. It truly is 5 star. Cesar H in the drive thru is the man. Hell of a nice guy and great at his job. He isn't the only one however. Every time I go here, I always leave impressed with how nice and professional the workers are."}
{"text":"I worked here for a little and was appalled when my check was for 3 hours of work when I had put in at least 11 for my first few days. I have been trying to get my money that I earned and I'm rather disappointed in management there specifically Marsue or however she spells it. I would not eat here comfortably knowing that their employees are being mistreated"}
{"text":"Went there a few times and everything was great. But recently, saw a fight between staff and customers, severely wrong order. What I got and what I ordered were not even imaginable as being accidental. There's a new Zaxbys in that area, go there instead."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience and food has always been fresh. Luckily,  they arent like other Taco Hells that leave you with explosive . 

I will state that tonight they forgot my drink so I bumped down the 5 stars to 4."}
{"text":"I go to this Taco Bell/KFC because it's close to home...and that's the ONLY reason!

The staff can be rude at times and doesn't give much thought to customer service. The employees are unaware of what actually comes in combos and will give misinformation. When eating here I always go inside to order so that I can ask  what food is fresh, that'll determine what I order.

I gave them two starts because the restaurant is clean and they've got a high sanitation rating."}
{"text":"The food was good but staff forgot to give a fork for taco meal! They were standing around talking period. There time was a bit too long!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this particular Taco Bell.  : (  Will never eat Taco Bell again.  I don't care how late you're open OR how much I've had to drink...it's not worth it.   If you're looking for great Mexican food...go up the street to Fausto's or Roberto's."}
{"text":"Eh. I know it's only fast food, but how many idiots are working in the kitchen? I wish there was a closer one so I could go there in the hopes that they'd get our order correct!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good 1 time, then not so good, then bad.    
   It's just hard to figure out when the workers who care about their jobs are working.  The food is different on different days. Some on the works just don't  care.

I will go back to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this Taco Bell probably 3 times a week, the food and service is very good...But pretty much every time we go there is a group of teenagers there, they are very loud and sometimes using profanity and jumps around in the booths..now I know teenagers are going to be teenagers but when there's older people there and younger children there we don't want to hear that, and no one ever says nothing to them. Sometimes we just want a quite dinner. And children don't need to be hearing that."}
{"text":"The woman who works the drive-thru week day mornings is seriously the nicest most encouraging person. Always great attitude - asks about your day - you can tell she looks at her role more than just a place to work but she actually brings joy into her slice of the world."}
{"text":"I don't know about everyone else but my food is always fresh and fire as fuuuuuuuq when I get it no matter what time of day I go there, compared to the other taco bell's in the area, this one is always on their shit \m/
It's worth waiting the 15 minutes in line for, be patient people can only work so fast, if they got your order right and the food is good one shouldn't complain."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever received here. My boyfriend stopped by here on his way home from work. Told the employees that I am highly allergic to tomatoes so everything had to be tomato free. Got home and there were tomatoes mixed in all of my food. I called to tell them. The girl was rude. Would barely let me speak and was defensive as I tried 4 times to tell her that tomato had gotten mixed in with the lettuce and cheese. She wasn't going to do anything about it until I asked well what are you going to do about the food I bought and can't eat. Then she put me on hold for the second time.  She wouldn't tell me her name. Finally got her to agree to  remake my food. Unbelievably rude. I will never come back here. Now I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come back with my food again. If I do have an allergic reaction I will sue them"}
{"text":"Granted this is fast food, so I don't expect the highest of standards. I ordered 1 meal, a chicken quesadilla and taco. Taco was cold, quesadilla was steak not chicken and cold as well. Needless to say I wasn't too happy when I got home."}
{"text":"Nice location and the restaurant was very clean. The service was good and the food was good. Only thing I did not was the WiFi was locked and had to ask for the password which by the way is LiveMas!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for my order, I then went up there and told a couple young guys \" hey I still haven't got my order\" they kind of looked at me and went on doing their work. After another 5 minutes went by I asked the young lady had taken my order initially, where's my order? I told her what it was but she needed the receipt, I returned from my table and gave her the receipt, add another 6 minutes till my food was done. I know what everyone is saying, \" It's Taco Bell\" . Sad thing is none of the employees seem like they really want to be there. During this visit I was real nice and not rude. Service and a pleasant atmosphere would make a difference, the food,,,,,,,,,, well it was ok."}
{"text":"This place is so disorganized and the staff is honestly not very friendly.  First if you ask for something that is on your meal to be on the side they charge you an extra .30 per item and then they completely messed up my order.  I will not be returning here.  I guess the only good thing is the food was hot."}
{"text":"Great service! Went for a midnight Taco Bell outing and it couldn't have been better! The drive-through cashier was so nice! Food was good, it tasted like Taco Bell what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Well for one it's tacohell what do you expect. Literally the only time I eat here is when I'm pregnant. For what ever reason I crave tacobell. It's fake meat and not even real Mexican food. That being said it's  exactly what I expected it to be and satisfied my odd pregnancy craving. They did forget my cheesy potatoes and empanada but when my husband went back they apologized and gave us free cinnamon twist. So that's cool with me."}
{"text":"Don't go here. I received a Mexican pizza and nachos that tasted like soap. Yes, soap folks. Another time, I went in to get food and the man who handed me my food had at least a half inch of dirt under his fingernails. I will never go back. I also don't think I can ever go back to a T BELL again."}
{"text":"Worst. Taco Bell. Ever. I came in tonight to order dinner for my family. I was greeted by a disinterested cashier named Alyssa. She had attitude the entire time taking my order and without shock got my order wrong. When I approached an employee that gave me my order that some of it was wrong she was nice and made it right. Alyssa on the other handed decided it would be a good idea to banter back and forth with me that I was wrong and she was right and I ordered the wrong thing. I have been in the customer industry (serving, manager, ECT) and you NEVER argue with a customer and tell them they are wrong with a dining room full of customers to hear. As the rest of my order is being made/fixed I watch Alyssa walk over to the line they were cooking food and I hear her bad mouthing me and telling another co-worker and a manager what happened. I was completely astonished that she had the nerve to bad mouth me to a manager as a manager engaged while I'm standing there witnessing it all. Alyssa than proceeds to toss me my food with a huge attitude, when I asked her to speak to a manager she walked away and got the one that she was bad mouthing me with. When the manager approached me I asked to talk to another manager and she started arguing with me saying they were busy and that she was the only one who could help me, I proceeded to tell her that I would wait. So the manager angerly walks to the back with attitude throwing her hands up bad mouthing me once again to another manager. A young gentle who claims to be the assistant manager listens to my issue and just doesn't seem to care. I told him that I was going to call corporate because I felt so disrespected and he said it didn't matter cause it all comes back to him anyways. At that point I see the general manager who was the nicest lady and the only reason I will be returning to this location. I come to this taco Bell very often normally during the day. The crew they have during the day is incredible. They are polite, and have great customer service. Alyssa you definitely need some training on the customer service aspect. You are rude and lucky I didn't slap you behind the counter"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever. I don't know what's wrong with this location particularly with the drive thru after hours. There's been countless times where they screwed up my orders but after tonight I will never go back. On 6-13-17 around 11:30pm I placed an order with no cheese and sour cream as printed on the receipt. I get home and sure enough they put cheese and sour Cream. I immediately drove back to the drive thru, waited in line, and had them redo the order. The lady at the window even came back to make sure I didn't want Cheese. Few minutes later she comes back and hands me the order. I immediately checked the order while in my car and g..damnit it still had cheese and sour cream. WTF is wrong w these people??  That was it. I asked for my money back and will never ever go back to this particular store. Bunch of uneducated unprofessional people working there."}
{"text":"Your average run of the mill taco bell here folks....food quality is what you would expect from a fast food mexican food restaurant and the inside of the place is nice and clean and a decent environment as well"}
{"text":"Always disappointed when I come to this location. On top of that I'm always scared as hell im going to get food poison AGAIN. I know your saying why the hell go back well it's been a few years so I figured I'd give another try ! Food taste like it's been sitting from last night. Also the the cashiers there are young and inexperienced. They will ask you on the monitor do you want sauce or and drink by when you get to the window they take your money and completely forgot to put sauce in the bag or your drink. Get it together Charleston & Lamb !!"}
{"text":"The service and all that was fine - nice people behind the counter.  This is the first time we've ever had breakfast at TB.  Meh, I think I would've given it 2 stars.  Definitely not something I will crave in the future.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"I would give it another star if the dining room was clean, usually it is not too good.  I am happy to have some variety and my son usually places an order for taco's with meat only and it takes some effort for them to ring it in but they are friendly about it and once the order is placed it does come out alright.  For what it is they do a pretty good job."}
{"text":"I complained about my visit via the information provided on the receipt. All I wanted was a gift card for my $12.59 I spent mailed to me. In a few days I was emailed  and told that someone would call me. I got a rather incoherent voice mail from someone telling me he apologized for \"my impression\" of the service and I would be contacted later.  No call back.  

These people suck and deserve to fail."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell, I'm there for quick drive thru meal, not a five star experience. We usually have a missing item or a beef item that should have been chicken but this meal was over the top terrible.   I guess burnt is a new flavor I was unaware of & R.I.P. Mexican pizza, I wish you could have floated to safety.   Sorry I had to give it a star.    I did get a refund for all the food I ordered,  when I drove all the way back.  Just another waste of 30 minutes of my life because somebody at Taco Bell thought this was edible.   Thanks Taco Bell for making my Halloween quick, easy & burnt.  NEVER RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION !"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible horrible, nearly 40 minutes stuck in the drive-through. No apology when I got to the window. They just don't care. Possibly the worst drive through in the country."}
{"text":"Literally I am obsessed with Taco Bell. Viva la Taco Bell. Taco Bell forever."}
{"text":"The time on the window says you're open until 1 AM on Saturday evening. All of the lights are on, including all of the signs on the exterior. I pull up at 12:05am. No one is responding to the intercom. I pull up to the window and honk my horn three times. I see the girl inside but she is not responding. After honking again three times in a row, she finally looks at me. She verbalizes \"no we are closed\" and makes hand gestures, but doesn't actually come to the window to speak with me. I point to the time on the window that shows 1 AM on Saturday evening. She puts her hands up again like I'm the idiot. Never actually speaking with me face-to-face. Taco Bell executives, pay attention - I rarely ever go to Taco Bell because of these types of instances with your company. Dumping you guys for good after this."}
{"text":"They fuck up my order everytime i go threw the drive threw at night"}
{"text":"People are really nice... Service is really slow.  Tons of people in the drive through. Happening place.  An obvious friend of the staff is disrupting the smooth flow of the establishment.  Place is clean too.  They did offer me a drink for the inconvenience of waiting so long so that's a big plus."}
{"text":"Five dollar meal and a free colonoscopy. Overall pretty good experience. I won't walk right for three days but let's be real, it comes with the territory."}
{"text":"Okay, so the people at the drive-thru window are nice...but the 20-25 minute wait I have been stuck in multiple times is not. Even Taco Bell is not worth those wait times."}
{"text":"The worst Taco Bell EVER!!!!! It's Friday night and the place should be fully staffed and prepared for a steady rush all night long.....we were in the line from beginning to end 49 minutes!!!!! Such crap!"}
{"text":"LIARS!!!! Sign said open til 1 am and it was 12:50 and they were still there! My taco bell satisfaction was ripped from me. I thought this was America, taking away my Taco Bell privileges and sh*t. Good thing jack in the box is always here for us and they are nice!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love Taco Bell. I wish there was 1 in Bradford. Only issue with this Taco Bell is that they don't seem to listen. Like when I say no cheese sauce I mean, NO CHEESE SAUCE!!! I'm sure lots and lots of people love that liquid orange goop, but not me. For the love of god... Stop with the friggin cheese sauce... It's nasty and disgusting. When I say no cheese sauce, don't put it on!!! 

Because of the cheese sauce issue, I'm only giving 3 stars. If you listened to me and didn't put that nasty goop on my food, it would easily be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Service was good and staff was friendly. Wait wasn't too long and it's in a good location. Will definitely be back again. This was all from the drive through and was pretty impressed, next time I'll have to go inside lol"}
{"text":"Dylan r is the best employee ever. He was very helpful with my first visit and so patient with me. He deserves a raise for how amazing his customer service was. Extremely satisfied with him. I can't complement him enough"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times while going to or from the in laws. SAme Taco Bell goodness!"}
{"text":"Nicest Taco Bell ever. They have the best workers for fast food. They are always nice and respectable."}

It just sucks when you spend the last of your cash and don't get what you pay for.

Order #368569"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is by far the worst I have ever been to. They are lazy and constantly get my order wrong. I've seen inside the back door and the kitchen seems to always be dirty. My husband and I would rather drive an extra 5 miles to a different location then to ever go back here again."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm reviewing Taco Bell.

I'm not going into detail about the food.  It's well made and if you're going to Taco Bell you already know what it's like.

What I'd like to shine a light on is the excellent staff at this particular location.  I've never been to a fast food joint with a more likeable and professional staff.

The managers in particular deserve major props.  Both of the gentlemen are polite, incredibly friendly and actually seem to enjoy what they do.  They joke, laugh and generally act like good human beings.

Even though I try to avoid fast food, the pleasant experience I have at this Taco Bell has given me extra incentive to gnaw on a burrito every now and then."}
{"text":"The kids that work here never get my order wrong. The one thing I don't like is the way their drive thru is situated and next to a busy fitness center too. 
It's better to park and run inside for your order than to use the drive thru. Be prepared to move back and forth as people try to leave the parking lot. But, I suppose we have no choice since this is the only Taco Bell in miles and it's good \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"It's lunch time, 1:30 line in the drive through around the parking lot.
Inside, all the tables are dirty 
Cashier was very nice, friendly and helpful. 
Tea was out."}
{"text":"I like Taco Bell and this one is good and I go to it, I like the beefy five layer burrito"}
{"text":"If you want fast food or the correct order, this isn't the place for you! Expect 30 min drive through waits and to get home to the wrong order. Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else for fast food!"}
{"text":"Let me give you some background: It was two years ago in May. I was still eating meat. I got the same thing every time at Taco Bell: Chicken quesadilla, extra quesadilla sauce on the side, and fire sauce. I use an entire packet of fire sauce with every single bite. That's honestly the only reason I come to Taco Bell: for the sauces. The sauces are supreme considering they come in little packets. 

This Taco Bell experience is embedded into my brain and will never leave it. I just ate Taco Bell where I live in Michigan and it reminded me of this night in Charlotte, NC. I had to come on Yelp and finally give my first Yelp review. 

Five stars is a lot, but let me tell you, this late night Taco Bell stop was a pleasure for me and my pals who were paling around starting only hours before. We attempted to sing karaoke but this one guy kept doing The Killer's songs over and over again, which was fun, but this caused us to not have a single chance at going up to sing. The bar closed, we decided to leave, and my friend got in the driver's seat and I demanded with all my might to go to Taco Bell. On the way we listened to Taylor Swift's \"22\" on repeat and sang so much my friend lost her voice. I had to pee like a race horse. 

We finally get to Taco Bell, placed our order, and drove up to the window. \"Would you like any sauce with your meals tonight?\"

My eyes grew big. My heart grew strong. My mind raced -- I heard it -- my calling -- \"sauce.\" 

\"ALL THE FIRE SAUCE, please.\" I demanded from the passenger seat. 

The man working there gave me an entire Taco Bell bag full of fire sauce. I will never forget this night, or that man, who I called an angel a number of times. I think of him time to time, wonder what he's doing, what other people he is doing good for. It was truly a blessed experience at a Taco Bell. 

*drinks fire sauce packet* I will never forget it."}
{"text":"Been going there since they opened, service has deteriorated in the last year, to the point that I am done frequenting this store.  Have stopped in the evening, seen 8 cars in the drive thru yet no one in the store, so I go into the store and literally waited 15 minutes for 3 tacos, I guess I just got put into the line with the cars, ridiculous bot not the show stopper.  Drive thru messes up orders on a regular basis, 3 of my last 4 orders were wrong - missing items, wrong type of tacos etc, but usually not worth the 3 mile drive back to the store.  But last night changed all that....

Last night, I ordered 3 Soft Taco Supremes with extra sour cream, simple right? Tthat is what I paid for.  I should have checked but I didn't, I get home to find 3 plain soft tacos, no sour cream, just sad little piles of soggy tortillas.  OK, here we go again, but this time I returned to the store and told them in the drive thru that they had made a mistake and I needed 3 Soft Taco Supremes with extra sour cream.  I pulled up, they would not take the original order back, they hand me a bag, I say \"3 Soft Taco Supremes with xtra sour cream right?\"  He paused, then said \"I think they forgot the sour cream\".  he then handed me a plastic tub containing about a tablespoon of sour cream ($1.20???)  I just shook my head and went home. Opened the bag.... and found 3 Hard Tacos.  This is insane right? 

 I get in the car and drive back for the 3rd time, this time I went into the store, and firmly requested they fix it.  Was a bit taken aback by the joking around about how they screwed up with the staff who was preparing the food, but I know better than to yell at the people handling my dinner lol.  The prep guy then brings me my bag and somewhat sarcastically opens up one of the bags to show me the \"See... soft taco supremes\"  at which point I had to ask him \"where is the sour cream?\"  he then went back and added a pile of sour cream to each taco, and I mean a pile, probably close to a 1/4 cup of sour cream per taco, I took the bag and left. Horrible experience after working outside in the AZ sun all day.

Thats it for me, going to have to hang up the taco cravings for the time being."}
{"text":"Just.....No.   Got two mexi-skillets, special order because I can't have carbs.  Got to work and opened the food and we just cracked up laughing because the food was so tiny.  It is usually small, but this was like a tablespoon in each bowl - not exaggerating.  There was maybe a half egg total in both bowls.  I usually save one for lunch, but today - Barbie and Ken sized portions gets 2 stars.  The Taco Bell at Mesa Dr and also on Country Club are way better. Dunno...Maybe they were out of eggs and didn't want to say?"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some fast and flavorful Mexican food. Also great for a quick midnight snack. Overall, great."}
{"text":"Would give a 0 if I could. Went here at 12 to the drive thru and the lazy worker tells me through the drive thru after I order that they don't have cheese or beef. Literally everything on their menu food wise has cheese and/or beef. Obviously he didn't want to make anything before they closed ... AN HOUR FROM WHEN THEY WERE CLOSING. 

Ghetto cashier saying \"waddup\" through the speaker phone too. 

Don't come here....."}
{"text":"ugh. don't go to this one. Everyone knows this is literally the worst taco bell in phoenix. I've had conversations with friends about how horrible it is.
Nasty preparation of food. Literally mess up 75% of my order every time They always forget something too.
They don't care either. If they mess something up, it's kinda like \"oh well too bad\"."}
{"text":"At this Taco Bell it takes two people to mop the floor. One to mop and the other to watch; she must be training. In general, I avoid this one because the kids that work here spend more time socializing with each other than paying attention to the job they are getting paid for."}
{"text":"The best Taco Bell in Las Vegas, maybe the best ever. Every item is always filled to the max, this place never skimps on ingredients. Most Taco Bells will give you a burrito the size of your big toe, but not this place. I also tend to special order some items and they've never messed up my order. The employees have been incredibly friendly every time I've stopped here. Easy to get in and out of the place as well, very convenient after a stop at Apothecarium. The only downside is that they're not open late. The drive thru can get a little busy around lunch time, typical of almost every restaurant."}
{"text":"This place needs a new manager. We ordered 12 tacos, drove all the way Home to only find 8 in the box? How can you fail to count to 12? To Make matters worse we called and they said they can only replace the missing tacos! How about our time? The first time we called the staff member said she'll replace the whole order and I thought that was fair . Not after I called a second time. She said, well I'm the manager and we're only replacing 4 tacos. I will never again go to this location"}
{"text":"Tried out the quesalupa taco deal from taco bell this afternoon and give it 4 stars. I got the need and shredded chicken. I would for sure get the beef again the chicken I'm not so sure about and at 3.50 a taco you better know what you wanna do.it's too bad they only have the breakfast stuff until 11am since I'm rarely out of the house before 1. 

As far as this taco being bigger than the base drop - it's falls flat of that but it is a tasty taco.

Bigger than the internet? Now I feel I've been oversold - which saddens me.

Good tacos but not worth 3.50 each. Next time I'll try and barter!"}
{"text":"This particular Taco Bell is one of my favorites. One cool aspect is that it's only two blocks off a Metro Parks multipurpose trail. ( I can use it as a bike ride destination.) I also like the Parma neighborhood feel about the location. Pearl Road has lot's of traffic but not enough to drive one insane. Anyway, the management seems to hire pretty squared away people. The restaurant has always apperaed to be clean. It's well lit and has a pleasant view from the dining room windows. For those that happen to live in the neighborhood, I'd say they are pretty lucky."}
{"text":"7 layer burrito fresco style is always my go to! Today I had the mexican pizza veganized and my boyfriend had a combo with a taco and burrito. Staff is always very nice! I do have to note that the elderly man who I assume is manager there, is kind of an asshole, I feel bad for the employees who have to deal with him!"}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell in the company. I've visited this location off and on for years and have never had a bad customer service experience. My vegetarian order is always exactly what I asked for. Employees are friendly and upbeat. Nice job Taco Bell!

12-1-17 Just watched the employees at this location deal with an absolutely impossible customer. She was itching for a fight from the minute she walked in. I used to deal with the public in my job, and I recognize the type. I left around the time she began to lecture you about how she pays your salary. Please. Anyway, you handled it professionally, and you are still my favorite Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I had never gotten bad customer service at this place.  My food is always handed to me quick and with a smile. :^) I'm coming here for on the go food instead of that ghetto ass McDonalds across from this taco bell."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is awesome. They just went over and beyond service when I stated 1 taco was missing from my order. Manager quickly got it taken car of no questions asked, got me another taco and then another in for free and topped it off with cinnamon twists as well as two free taco coupons!!! Not only that but food tasted fresh and better than any Taco Bell Ive been too. Whatever your doing, keep it up."}
{"text":"Horrible l, I got my food and I had hair in it, very disappointed in this Taco Bell, not to mention it is the oldest Taco Bell I have ever been at, poor service and a waste of $6, do not go here"}
{"text":"You don't go to a fast food place and expect a joyful and pleasant experience. But Nancy and the staff here create a happy and pleasant atmosphere. It is like they actually want to provide a not only good, but great experience for the customers they serve. Nancy seems to set the mood. The staff here need a raise. They have set a new standard of what I expect from other Taco Bells, and other fast food establishments. Joyful and pleasant! Thank you Nancy and team.

Clean location! I mean, it's Taco Bell, you don't usually go to Taco Bell expecting the cleanest of environments. However, this place is pretty close to downtown Phoenix and it is clean! The bathrooms need a little help, but I almost never expect a clean bathroom when I leave home.

Excellent experience from a fast food place. I was not expecting that! I was just expecting another Taco Bell. Other fast food joints can learn a few things from this location. Again, they need a raise!

Side note: Jeff, I believe the manager (I overheard he is managing 6 locations), was there for an inspection. Even under stress, the staff provided my family and I am excellent experience. His staff here are doing great!"}
{"text":"They make you go inside in the mornings just to see the breakfast menu. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nice location, restaurant is clean etc.. I'm a fan of Taco Bell but not with the tall fella who waited on me. He doesn't talk much which is a shame. They ran out of medium lids so I asked him if I could have one. He went to the back & gave me one & walked away. No communication whatsoever. Actions speak louder than words.  I also work in the customer service industry & we are told to treat everyone with conversation & with a smile. Guess he missed that day during training."}
{"text":"I ordered the 5 dollar box and wanted a soft taco and got a hard taco, it's just annoying that people don't listen when it's a free choice. But you made sure to charge me the money to upgrade the drink..... but maybe it's the training that takes place, it is Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Got a kick out of my visit to Taco Bell at Tallmadge Circle today. It was late for lunch, 2:15 p.m., so nobody was at the drive-thru. Yay for me, lol. I ordered a 'Volcano $5 Buck Box,' According to wht the young lady at the window said, it was a 'VERY HOT' Taco, burrito and guordito (?)' I may be wrong about the last item but it was three very hot items and a drink for $5.00. I pulled up to the window to pay for my 5 Buck Box and the girl politely says, '$6.12, please'. I said, 'What?' and she politely repeated herself. I asked her why she was charging me six bucks for a five buck Box. She said she didn't know and tht's wht they charged everyone. She didn't seem to recognize how funny it was to say, 1 5Buck Box with a diet Pepsi, 6 bucks please.' Her manager then stepped forward and told me they 'were not a corporate Taco Bell, they were an independent Taco Bell' so they 'charge people whatever we want to.' OUCH!!!! Watch out ladies and gents.
Food was exactly wht you would expect for Taco Bell, nothing special."}
{"text":"When in a hurry I usually go through the fast food drive-through at Taco Bell. The staff is usually great and make sure to take care of me as I go on my way. I wish the parking/drive through situation space was better, but it still gets the job done as far as quick take out!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time because it's right down the stream from my house. The food is really good and the inside is clean. 

The reason I took off a star is because I come here and I order a bean burrito with NO onions, and almost every time there is onions on it. It will even say \"- O\" on the wrapper. So I go to take a bite and then I have a mouth full of onions. It makes me sick and I have to spit it out and throw it away. Sometimes the order is actually right and there is no onions and I'm happy. So PLEASE make sure when someone says don't put something. Please try to not put it. This isn't just this Taco Bell either. It's happened at other ones too. It makes me scared to order a burrito lol

The food is very good though when it's made correctly."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm going to say this but I was very impressed with this Taco Bell! 

To be fair my expectations were very low based on past experiences at other locations where I was barely helped, the food was cold and more often than not wrong. However, this location really changed my mind. 

Stopped in during Happy Hour...where all medium drinks are $1 and decided to get a Mountain Dew Baja Blast, nachos and chicken burrito. 

Now, I can only speak for the drive thru but on my visit service was fast and very helpful. In previous reviews many said that the drive thru was pretty slow and inefficient. But, the young man that helped me was very pleasant, he greeted me confirmed my order and said thank you! When I got to the window, he was smiling and waiting, we swapped money for my bag of goodies and drink and I was on my merry way! Literally five minutes tops...perhaps it was just a good day?!?! Whatever the case I'm not complaining! 

The Mountain Dew Baja Blast was a little different than what I was expecting...it's like a Slurpee ( 7-11...YUM) but lacked the flavor I was looking for, literally after three sips all the syrup and flavor was gone and I was stuck with shaved ice...not great but I will give it another chance. 

As for the food, my order was prepared correctly and was hot! I really enjoyed it.

Totally will be back to this location!"}
{"text":"5 stars to the gentleman that runs the drive-thru in the mornings. He is always courteous and efficient and enjoys what he does. He should be a manager."}
{"text":"I feel dirty saying this, but I ate lunch here on Friday. I usually don't stoop to eating at Taco Bell, unless I am really drunk, hungry, and it is the only place open. 

I was late for a meeting, broke, and it was the closest place I could get lunch for the $2.50 I had on me.

I got two crunchy taco supremes, which are just tacos with sour cream. They were gross, and I hope the next time I am drunk I will remember this."}
{"text":"Decent food after a night of drinking, but I'm allergic to tomatoes & they added tomatoes to my order. I specifically said no tomatoes on my order it's not that difficult. 

Figure it out, it's not that complicated.

They get 4 stars, because the Doritos tacos are amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while with my kids.. the place looks clean and today Jose was extra nice to me.. the staff is usually good I've never had a problem here"}
{"text":"I used to eat out there a lot after exercising at Bally's"}
{"text":"If I could give -10 stars I would. 2 days ago I went to this location and ordered my cantina bowl as I usually do. When I got my food I noticed there was a white hair on the edge of the bowl, then after I took a bite, and kid you not, there was a little string piece of aluminum foil in the food, and then I searched some more and found another one. Normally someone would be very upset but I decided to just get my refund and leave. Do not eat here, CLEARLY they don't pay attention when they're making your food. 

SO DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"This is the worst taco bell ever. My food was cold and the lettuce was old and almost brown. I will never eat at this one again.."}
{"text":"What a joke. After waiting for 20 minutes in the drive through for our 7 or 8 simple items, Joshua our cashier gave our food to us and it was completely wrong. Seriously how do you fk up a few burritos. They weren't even busy and staff seemed to just be hanging out. I asked our cashier if the burritos were how I asked and he nodded his head and replied yes. Never going here again shitty service even for a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place was recently renovated so I expected a clean and nice dining experience (as much as you can get in a fast food chain). Unfortunately it was dirty and messy inside and there was a slew of hobos inside and out."}
{"text":"I lovw Taco Bell.... I dont care what anybody has to say. They must be crazy if they dont like it. I know its not athenic. But is it really even supposed to. Hahaha"}
{"text":"I love the bell.... I know its not MEXICAN... But we american. Hey.. Taste good to us. LoL."}
{"text":"Clean location. Friendly staff. Efficient. 

I feel silly reviewing Taco Bell, but their regular plain tacos are a guilty pleasure of mine."}
{"text":"It took me 17 minutes to make it through the drive-through line.  It was not busy.  The young man offered me a free drink at the window, but I didn't want to wait a few more minutes for that.  I would have left, but they block vehicles from leaving the line.

The young guy at the window seemed stressed.  Perhaps he was new, overly anxious, and/or under trained.  Management at any meaningful level was completely absent that evening.  They really should have closed early that evening.  

A lot of homeless people hang out here if their presence bothers you for whatever reason.

I've never been shorted on hot sauce, and my order has never been messed up"}
{"text":"I know it seems like I'm snarking, but I'm not.  It's expected by most that a business stays open for its posted hours.  I went by tonight at 11:45pm.  Guess what?  Closed to the point of even the outside lights being off.  It was a black hole in the parking lot.  According to Taco Bell's website, they should have been open.  I wonder if the franchise owner is aware their employees are shutting down before their closing time.

Call me crazy, but I expect a business to be open when it claims it will be open."}
{"text":"In the drive thru right now. 20 min in the drive thru. Like what the hell get people who can do the job!!!"}

The manager of this location is very good and friendly; as are the employees.
Very clean, restrooms always clean.
A+"}
{"text":"I love this Taco Bell they always get my order correct and deliver fast. When I come here bring my whole family and the food is always tasty plus employees have great customer service! This is the best Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Sometimes I need me a bad burrito, and Taco Bell they offer a real bad burrito, and nachos supreme that will turn your stomach into a war zone. I was pleased to see that this Taco Bell offered Dr Pepper, I was a little sad when they let me know that it was only available in the bottle and there was an extra dollar charge. For my Dr. Pepper though I will suffer. 

If you are stopping here be ready to wait because this place is run by turtles, deaf turtles. Average amount of errors per order 3, repeats necessary to secure order, minimum of 5. Seldom over-busy however, so though you are waiting for the turtles, you are usually alone. 

Bottom line...this is slooooowwww fast food, but in a quagmire of bad fast food joints this isn't the worst."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Drive thu was closed, manager was not helping, 20min wait for food when it wasn't busy, and a hair in my taco. Place was filthy as well."}
{"text":"My son likes Taco Bell, so here we are. Service good, friendly cashier, even brought good to table !!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Taco Bell in all of creation! I waited in the drive thru line for about 15 minutes and I was only 3 cars back. Then once the guy behind me gave up and left, I backed out into a parking space to go inside and order. I was inside for another 15 minutes waiting on my order. They did offer me a free beverage for the delay, but they were also out of 3 fountain drinks. Not the fastest fast food experience of my life."}
{"text":"Not my normal eat spot by any stretch.  I was out and out and while cruising west on Warm Springs during rush hour traffic, I needed calories.  Starting in the are of the 15, I would eventually stumble on this spot.  

Why does it seem that when I pull into any drive-thru the first four cars in front of me pull into the same damn I am?!  This TB was no exception.

While waiting for those four cars to negotiate the squad box, when I pulled up, I found the clerk to be friendly enough.

Eventually I would make my day to the window to pay and pick up my chow.  

Some 15 minutes later, I was back out on Warm Springs. I laid waste to floor boards of my vehicle leaving traces of the A-OK chow while I only sought calories.  My lack of discipline sucks.  TB is not a staple and by no means a favorite.  Generic at best.  One would think the staff would be on point during rush hour.....but it was not.  

Trust you, me....I will exercise more discipline in the future and eat the petrified protein bar in my center console."}
{"text":"Best service and the friendliest people. Fast food has gotten a bad wrap but the crew here makes the experience great!"}
{"text":"I like Taco Bell. The variety they offer is exceptional and it allows me to orders something new every time. So, on the visit to this particular Taco Bell last week, I ordered some 10 items and the time they took to get it ready was not even 10 minutes. 

The Lacos-Tacos are a good twist to the traditional taco.

I was super impressed with the staff. Somehow, I forgot to pick one of the items that I ordered. The girl at the register, ran to me, all the way to the parking to hand it over."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell I have been to. Employees are rude and do not want to serve customers. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"Quick update, the Drive-Thru guy is \"Brad\""}
{"text":"I stop in at Taco Bell about once a week, typically going to the one on McClintock & Ray. Today I was in a different part of town so I came to this one instead. The service was typical for a drive-thru, but that surprised me as I was under the impression that ALL of Taco Bell was pushing for better customer service. 

The location on McClintock and Ray always has AMAZING customer service, with the drive-thru attendant genuinely asking how your day is going and occasionally throwing out a joke but always offering a smile."}
{"text":"Embarrassingly a regular at Taco Bell. But hey, when you are at work and in a rush on lunch then... well... Taco Bell is quick and easy."}
{"text":"Well, if you enjoy tacos or burritos prepared with grade \"D\" meat, this is the place for you!  Like to gamble with your health?  This is the place for you!  Want to spend under $2 for a complete \"meal\", this is the place for you.  

My bean burrito was uninspiring.  I ordered a bean burrito with sour cream.  They squirted a little in to one end of the burrito.  It must have been to much work to unroll an already prepared bean burrito, or create a new burrito with the sour cream evenly dispensed.  Am I nit picking?  I don't think so...there's a right way to do things and apparently the workers here are too busy to make an order right.

Buy a can of retried bean and some tortillas at the store and make your own...at least your gonna get what you want."}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars if I could. 
We came at 1:30 in the afternoon and there was practically no one else in the dining room and no one at the drive-thru. We waited fifteen minutes for our modest food order (food for two adults, one child, and one toddler), which gave us plenty of time to clean our disgusting table while an employee watched. 
While we were waiting for our food another family, who had been behind us in line, ended up leaving because no one ever even came up to take their order. 
After fifteen minutes we got our cold and undercooked food. 
While we were eating my husband found a blue sticker stuck on the bottom of his grilled stuffed nacho. Horrified, he brought it to the attention of the manager, who took it without a word and threw it away. No apology, no nothing. 
This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had."}

This one is brand new and very pretty.
Don't listen to the HATERS

It doesn't TRY to be GOURMET so I ALWAYS get what I expect @ TB"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here. First I come and my order is completely wrong but I don't notice until I make it home. Then after realizing it was wrong I called to tell them but decide to just eat what I got so I don't have to drive back. While eating I notice a big black hair in my taco. So I drive all the way back. Instead of a full refund they just give me new food. Like I would still have an appetite after pulling a hair from my food. Gross."}
{"text":"A mainstay when it come to eating on the go. Especially when you've only got a limited amount of time to eat. Close by and has never given me any problems. Food prep is excellent and presentation, all be it wrapped, is worth the trip. Everyone behind the counter has always done a great job. Its what keeps me coming back. Thanks for working hard, not hardly working."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru no less than 20 minutes because my daughter REALLY wanted TB before practice.  Finally aborted mission after we'd then sat at the order station for another 3-5 minutes without a peep...went to KFC across the street.  What a mess.  Won't be back...EVER!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru !! Typically I wouldn't judge a place by a wait, but I wait EVERY time I come here for at least a solid 10min in the drive thru."}
{"text":"This location consistently has the LONGEST lines of all time. One night my husband and I stopped in just for a carmel apple empenada after 8pm and we waited over 20 minutes! The staff came out and offered us a free drink, but this hasn't been the only time we've had to wait. I also don't like that you can only order taco bell items from their drive thru. The drive through is consistently long and frequently blocks parking in the area as well. Overall, if you have to get something fast, try Subway or McDonalds in the same area. The chances of you getting in and out of her in less than 15+ minutes is highly unlikely."}
{"text":"The wrist service ever just tried to screw me and my friend over on 11 dollars.causr they couldn't listen to simple directions"}

Sadly watched some lady up and leave at him joking... ugh. Some people REALLY need to relax."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Taco Bell I've ever experienced! Every single time I go there, something is missing or wrong on my order.  When I end up having to go back to get the right food, the people seem apathetic and give an insincere apology. And when I say every single time, I'm not exaggerating. The people at the drive through don't seem to want to be there. Last time I was in the drive thru, the worker gave me my food and didn't say anything. I was just sitting there, because I wasn't sure whether my order was all there. Then another worker is there laughing and just says hi. The people who work there are clowns. Also I have gotten old and stale food from this Taco Bell. This is one god awful establishment that needs to go."}
{"text":"I always do the drive thru, and they are pretty fast. The people that work the drive thru are usually always friendly and funny. The food is good, especially the crunchy tacos and the Mexican pizza. I come to this location all the time because it's so close to where I live."}
{"text":"The taco bell across from Menards is the absolute worst. Not that I have high standards for taco bells. I have driven out of the drive through 2 times. I have been in the drive through 3 times total. The line is always backed up for 20+ mins and the one time I waited (only because I was in a truck and couldn't fit to get out) they didn't even apologize. Thankfully they must know they suck and made a wide drive through so you can leave!! After my last time leaving the drive through,  I haven't gone back and will take my business else where."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've donated unintentionally to this place from them over charging me on the side of potatoes, by charging me an extra $1 for fiesta potatoes. A side of potatoes is 50 cents, and fiesta potatoes with sour cream and cheese is $1.49. These people continue to over charge by registering it as fiesta potatoes and then removing the sour cream and cheese, but I am still getting charged $1.49 instead of 50 cents. My husband likes their potatoes so I end up donating them a dollar from their stupidity about 10 times a month! I'm not even exaggerating either, we frequent this location quite often. Today took the cake when it comes to common sense. They charged me once again for fiesta potatoes without removing sour cream and cheese, I said that is fine leave it and add a side of potatoes. So I end up paying $2 for one 50 cent side of potatoes! Where is the fiesta potatoes you also charged me for? I said leave it, not as in leave it out of my bag but charge me for it."}
{"text":"this is the worst taco bell on Madison   They always run out off food at night, and their closing ours are always inconsistent. Orders are almost always wrong and almost all the employees have no customer service skills. PLEASE take your business to the taco bell by east town mall. Its day and night there. They always have food and give you the correct orders every time. Everyone there is nice too. I have no jdea why this Taco Bell is still in business. TEAR IT DOWN"}
{"text":"I don't usually review fast food but we had a great experience with the manager here. 
We had a visit that didn't go well, so I wrote to them online. The manager got back to me in a few days, which was unexpected but awesome.

But, if we need a fix in a hurry late night especially we'll just head over to Taco Bell. :)"}

I been going since I was a child..

But...


The past few times they keep forgetting to get all my items in the bag at the drive through first it was the cheesy roll up missing... Glad my 2 year old didn't miss it, or else that would have been hell.. The next visit my husband gets the nacho cheese chips and they did not put the cheese in the bag.... 

Taco Bell sauce packets for the chips I guess... 

Come on Taco Bell pay closer attention to your drive through and making sure you get ALL the items in the bag. K Thanks...."}
{"text":"Usually good. Dumbass with the microphone asked after every item if that's all and every time I said you Don't gotta ask that there's a lot. Then I got my food. It was not the correct items and was loaded with the one thing that shouldn't have been on any of it. Sour cream. The food tasted like uncooked bacon. I'm not a happy customer where I usually go to to be a happy customer. Did not serve even the purpose of satisfying my hunger. I went to get go and let me tell you how much better it was (tho it was a free meal cuz they fucked up last time I was there) do yourself a favor tonight. And avoid Taco hell. Go to the get of gos.

However.. my tacos were dripping wet and soggy.. the people in the back looked as if they hated life and talked as if one another were stupid. Then.. now call me picky if you may, but when I go to get my food.. nothing. No thank you or have a good day.. just \"plop, here's your soggy tacos.\" I know good customer service.. and that was not. Minus the poor guy at the register."}
{"text":"Everytime my sister gets out of school she wants to go to Taco Bell and finally I gave in a took her. As we walked in you can see how nicely kept the building was and automatically got a great vibe from the employees. our cashier was funny and even cute (single ladiessssss :)). 
The was not very hot but still warm enough to where it tasted good. The only thing i ever really complain about is that everytime I eat tacos I have a horrible after taste left in my mouth , next time I'll buy gum before I go! 
Its a great place for on the go , just got off work or put of school type place.
Can you say \" quiero Taco Bell ?\""}
{"text":"There is nothing worse in fast food than getting home from the drive thru and realizing they forgot part of the order. When it's just my food, I check it before I leave. But when there's a group, it's hard to check the entire order before leaving the drive thru. Clearly that was a mistake!"}
{"text":"Review a fast food restaurant?    You are insane Robert T....just INSANE!   Yes, I know Taco Bell is not good for me and yes I know that I should not be eating it.   Got it.   Off your soap box now?    Can I get on mine?   Good...lets go.  First off I LOVE Taco Bell and FU for telling me what I can and cannot eat.  :-)

Now that is out of the way.....today I placed a Mobile App order.   it is kinda cool but saves very little time besides getting your order ready ahead of time and adding cool things to items.   Anyway, I used it and showed up to Taco Bell.  I went in the drive thru and they read my mobile order back to me and something was wrong.    I ordered a Steak Quesadilla and not and Chicken one.    I corrected the lady and she attempted to change the order.   10 minutes later a manager come on the speak.....10 minutes might I add and told me because it was a mobile order and I already pre-paid for my food he cannot change it to a steak quesadilla due to a price difference.   I am willing to pay the difference.  Nope....cant do that.

Ok...here is the deal.   I like Steak Quesadillas.   I hate anything chicken from Taco Bell.    Bottom Line.  So....Why would I order a chicken quesadilla (i assume the app messed it up).   OK....let me ask this too....when at taco Bell why would I not ask for something to be changed because that is not what I want to eat?    Do I seem out of line?   

Ok...I told him I did not order a chicken one...i ordered a steak and can easily pay the difference.   At this point the manager begins to yell at me.   Yes, a Taco Bell manager literally yelling at me about how this is how it is and I have to deal with it.  FINE FINE FINE.....give me that damn chicken quesadilla and the rest of my order.   This is going nowhere and have already taken 15 minutes longer than I wanted.   So I drive around to the window and wait....wait...wait some more.   Holy crap...this is Taco Bell not Ruth Chris.   So....I get my food and leave....then the thought crosses my mind.  yeah, I am not eating this stuff because I bet the MANAGER who yelled at me spit in my food or something.   I took the items out of the bag and guess what....no quesadilla at all and yes....it was paid for.

In closing....thank you for messing up my order and making not regret myself later for eating your food.   Also, if the manager who yelled at me reads this....have fun having a conversation with your regional manager."}

{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell.  It is its own type of food category because it's obviously not an authentic Mexican food restaurant, it's a chain.  I purposely drive the extra distance to go to this location over the others that I know are closer simply for the speed and courteous staff.  Their lunch time rush moves quickly, I have no hesitation jumping into the line when it's long.  The younger female and male workers in the window are polite and swift.  Thank you for maintaining this great speed! For those of us that need to get in and go for a quick lunch break."}

{"text":"I don't usually complain about fast food service or product. I understand that, typically, if you order garbage, then garbage you get....right? I would at least appreciate a smile with my trash bag, though. First off, I do not appreciate being rushed through my order. With a total of 3 cars in the parking lot (probably all employee vehicles) and no one beyond myself in the drive thru, I cannot imagine what rush you could possibly be in behind that speaker. Second, after ordering 2 chalupas, 2 encharitos, 1 burrito, 2 hard tacos, 1 mexican pizza, 1 nacho bellgrande, and 2 sodas....I have a hard time believing that my food was anywhere near fresh when the entire order was out before I even signed my receipt. Now, again, I don't expect 5-star gourmet in a fast food joint...but I at least expect what I order and when I ask for specific add on to my food that I am being charged for and you hand me cold, stale food without the additions that I PAID FOR then I know for a fact that service is not on your list of priorities. I understand what a drag it must be for responsible adults to be on the clock on New Years Eve....but you're on the clock until that time sheet says otherwise. Rushing through every order is not going to end your shift any faster. Basically, the short and skinny of my rant is... provide exceptional service, be proud of your work ethic, and be the best damn window girl you can be. Life's too short to suck."}
{"text":"The map is inaccurate.  This TB is on the corner of Rural & Ray, not Rural & Knox.  The people here are super friendly, the food is fresh.  That being said, it's a good TB as long as you don't have a \"special\" order. They've messed my order up the last 5 visits.   I like green sauce.  -red + green.  That's all.  Not difficult.  They just can't do it.   My today's visit, I was SO  pleasantly surprised that they gave me green sauce until I took another bite and discovered that they had forgotten the meat.  I  went back and had it redone.  They were very friendly- great service.  Got back home and had red sauce again.  Sheesh."}
{"text":"Low Carbing at Taco Bell!  This is a take out review.

Someone from work took orders for lunch at our Taco Bell here in Huntersville.  I need to stay low carb, so no beans, tortillas, etc.  I discovered that I could order stuff as a \"side\", and either have them put it all in one bowl, or do it myself.

This is the second time I have ordered like this, and they were great about it both times.  This was 4 sides of lettuce, 2 sides of chicken, 1 side of meat, and one side each guac and sour cream.  They came in their tiny individual containers, but they also put a large empty container in so I could put it together at the office.  It may look tiny when desperate, but together, it made a delicious filling lunch.  And only $5.50!

Yeah I know, it's Taco Bell, but it is still great when they are willing to make something the way you need it, AND get it right every time!  So kudos Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I've never had a good experience at this particular location. The hours state they are open until 3:30am, however, I've come here several times on a weekend evening and they were closed by 11pm. Tonight, they HAPPENED to be open (even though ALL the lights were off which made it appear that they were closed but I decided to try and see if someone would reply in the drive up anyways) and the man taking my order was pleasant, but when I drove around to the window, I could hear and see him coughing so hard that I'm shocked phlegm didn't fly out of his mouth. I am beyond disgusted. Yes, I understand this is Taco Bell and blah blah blah you get what you pay for, but seriously? Don't cough on or around my food."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's good sometimes you might have to wait on your food if it's midnight or something like that"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Taco Bell's I've ever been to. It was disgusting inside, the Womens bathroom wasn't working so I had to use the men's bathroom. Upon entering, it smelled like smoke, there was pee all over the seat, the floor had blood stains. Absolutely disgusted. 1 hour after eating there my 2 year old starting puking profusely. Went to the ER and she had food poisoning!! Keep in mind, she hasn't eaten since the morning so damn well it was this Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"We have been to several Taco Bell's throughout the valley and love to get the Diamondbacks deal.  Every other Taco Bell (probably half a dozen or so) we've been to will let you sub out the crunchy tacos for soft tacos for $.10 extra, but they said they couldn't do it here.  We won't come back to this one again.  We had very disappointed kids because they have a hard time eating the crunchy tacos.  We had to take them elsewhere."}
{"text":"I always say I am going to do a review on this Taco Bell and never do, mainly because I am too busy trying to get other food together for the kids since they have ruined my order yet again. 
They are rude when you order and act like they are doing you a favor. Every single time our order is messed up. Their drive-through always takes forever (we just waited at 7:30 at night over 13 minutes),  they are always out of everything and they never participate in promotions. I have literally never once got the correct order from there. A couple weeks ago they gave us somebody else's order, and the worst thing about it is we didn't find out till he got home! 
I always say I will never go back and this time I mean it."}
{"text":"By far the cleanest Taco Bell I have ever been in! Fast and friendly service, food was better than most, and the bathroom (which remains locked w/o key) was so clean you could eat in there. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Fast and Staff is amazing considering its location"}
{"text":"Not my first time here, but had such a great experience in the drive-thru. Nina was so friendly and engaging, I found myself wanting to chat with her. This wasn't an ordinary fast-food visit. I'll come back just to see her again. The food has never disappointed at this location, either. I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this Taco Bell 0 stars.
Line wrapped around the building but not moving.
Inside, cashier at the front is rude and SLOW.
Her visor was COVERED in cat hair.
She didn't even look up.
Quick to tell me \"Not ready to swipe\" after not saying a word to me other than my order.

Food is good, but the service and that cashier make this a 1 star review at best!"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about.  Food was okay, service was okay.  Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Horrible!! If you have to drive 50 miles to the next Taco Bell, it's worth it. My tacos were slimy and had sloppy ingredients,  5 shreds of lettuce, paid for nacho cheese sauce wasn't even 1/4 of the way full . Mexican pizza was a mess and didn't taste good.  I have never been so mad when I got my food home."}
{"text":"well, darn.

i would rate this place negative ten, but yelp requires a rating, so i grudgingly give it a one.

we got carry out here last tuesday, 10/17/2017, around noon or 1 pm.

i had a chicken quesadilla. considering it was wrapped in paper before i got to it 30 or so minutes later, it was pretty good.  in fact, it is the only thing i have ever eaten at taco smell that was not repulsive.  it was, really ok.  big surprise for me.

my woman, otoh, had a pair of tacos, less cheese.

she was deathly sick for the next 24 hours.

squirting at both ends.

i mean seriously, gut wrenching puking for a whole day.

somebody call the department of health?

i'm new to this neighborhood and just don't know how to properly brace these ***^^les.

i will never approach this place again.

eat at your own risk!!!!"}
{"text":"This was definitely the wrong place to stop for dinner. The service was so slow took 18 minutes to get two items i ordered and only had 2 people ahead of me waiting before i ordered. The tables had the trash removed but were all dirty so i am assuming the few patrons there just threw away there own trash. Will not return to this location again."}
{"text":"Fine but always check your bag, this one In particular is really bad at charging for and item but you may not receive it"}
{"text":"I know taco bell is low end mexican food but I ordered the flatbread sandwich and it looked like someone took a gordita and added cheese and some bits of steak. I think 1 piece of bacon was more meat than what came in my sandwich. I won't be buying rhis anymore. Fail taco bell."}
{"text":"Okay, whats in the bag and whats advertised are way too far apart. Can you guess which one is which?"}
{"text":"Love taco Bell and this one is one of my favorites. Super friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"I love this place the lava taco is amazing and the carmel empenadas are a good treat."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. My husband used to work very near here, and I would meet him for lunch. I have had only one good experience here, and the staff made that one passable.
If you don't want anything you ordered, but want to pay for it, this is your one stop shop. 
I normally order a quesadilla, but at this location, my last one had a chemical taste. I took a bite and it tasted like I tested a 9V battery with my tongue. The staff , save a very few individuals, simply couldn't care whether you were there or not. Deplorable."}
{"text":"Used the drive thru. Fast and friendly staff. Order was double checked which was great due to lot of special changes. Great job no problems."}
{"text":"Eating in is ok!

going through the drive through....WRONG EVERY TIME!!  

Clean place nice folks....just don't drive through. LOL"}
{"text":"I usually get the #9 which is a crunch wrap and taco. The food is almost always served to order except if it's lunch... but the service is normally good and quick. I stop by here a couple times a week to grab a quick bite. Not the healthiest thing I've ever done but soooo tasty I can't help myself!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I asked for Nacho Bell Grande with no sour cream or beans and what do I get? Beans and cheese only. The tacos had no filling and the sad part was, it wasn't even crowded. I know it's Taco Bell, but still, have some standards. I should have spent more money and gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews for Fast Food Restaurants. But had to for this location! Food was on point and Fresh!! Every time I order the Mexican Pizza I always ask for Light Sauce and I end up getting Light on Everything! But this time they actually did it Perfect!! DELISH!! Made me want to order another one. Lol."}
{"text":"Was happy with speed of ordering process, guy asked me to confirm order on screen...everything was correct. I take my 2 taco salads (no tomato) and $5 box home (I spent less today to feed three of us than I did yesterday for one). I get home, ready to eat...spend the next 5 minutes picking out tomato! I'm not allergic, so not a big deal but it's annoying. I said no tomato, the screen said no tomato...it looked like someone attempted to remove the tomato and what they couldn't remove they covered with sour cream. I don't normally review fast food places, but at least they tried?"}
{"text":"This is a new Taco Bell.  It is small, but really clean and nice.  Good location with lots of easy parking.  The folks working the counter are very nice.  Sometimes they even give me a senior discount!"}
{"text":"I love this place but the guy working today was so rude on the drive thru- 9:27pm 2/17/16
ordered a 12 pack tacos with a gordita deal C and also 4 grillers. we tell him make sure we have enough hot sauce and he says its in the bag & closes the window super fast as i check my bag before leaving i see he didnt give us the doritos nor enough sauce only 7 fire and 6 hot for all my food like come on dont be stingy. its not like they were busy only us in drive thru and 2 people eating inside. if u dont like ur job please leave and stop with ur horrible service and go else where. 
we proceeded inside and the older lady was so nice. 
please leArn customer service from ur fellow co workers. Thanks!!! 
besides that food is alwys good here.."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through here last week and the gentleman who helped us (Jordan J.) was great! He was hilarious! This guy needs a promotion for sure and definitely deserves a spot on tv some day. He brightened my day and I'll come back here just for the awesome service."}
{"text":"Horrible and very slow service.. i spent about 30 mins in the drive through for 2 tacos.. there were only 3 cars in front of me as well... never going back to this location again.... its not a fast food.."}
{"text":"Got our order wrong 5 times in one night! Apparently it's hard to read a monitor and follow what is listed. We paid $9 for 3 side items that were 1.49 a piece. We didn't realize we were over charged until we got home and looked at the receipt. Zero refund for their mistake. We will never go here again. HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"This place is better then all the other restaurants in this corner. I like going here and my food is made right most of the time. If they mess up its during a rush to be honest and they always fix it. Everyone is nice and likes talking to everyone. I never get mad at them."}
{"text":"Yum. 
I have to sneak to taco bell, because my guy is on the non gmo, all organic kick. Taco bell has teamed up with doritos, I had the spicy/firey taco today and it was great.... 

Taco bell has also teamed up with chef Garcia... Who has been on top chef masters (bravo). They are really trying to make a difference taste/quality wise with that line. Had the nicest encounter with a 'Timothy' today.
Not authentic enough for ya ? Boo hoo... You want \"more authentic\" Tacos ? Go somewhere else. 

 No complaints!"}
{"text":"I work at a Farmers Insurance office, a few blocks away. Normally stop there at least once a week for lunch. 
The menu is the same as any other Taco Bell... What sets this location apart from any other location is the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the superior customer service. Even when it's very busy, the employees are constantly cleaning. Best Taco Bell in town!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!

I went through the drive through... Ordered 3 soft tacos, a burrito supreme, & Mexican Pizza... I didn't get 2 of my tacos.

I called several times, nobody answered! 

I will never go to this crap hole again!"}
{"text":"I was eating at this location today, and was pretty impressed. The store had plenty of parking spots around the building. I believe there were 2 entrances into the diner, maybe even three. The place was clean during Lunch time rush! The employees were friendly, and easy to understand. The service was very fast, and accurate. I will be dining at this Taco Bell again!"}
{"text":"I went here once in August 2013. I haven't eaten at a Taco Bell since the pink sludge thing hit the news, not even sure what year that was, but I read they stopped adding it to their taco filling.

The place is kinda worn inside but mostly clean. The service is somewhat slow for a fast food restaurant. There were only two people visibly working there, which was a bit odd considering how busy it was. It cost about $3.30 for two of their cheapest tacos to go. I waited about 11 minutes, or maybe it just felt like 11 minutes.

I first went to Taco Bell in 1975 in Texas, there was nothing similar around chicago back then that I ever saw. Taco's then were about 49 cents each.

Now I see that a normal taco is no longer on the menu, so prices have tripled for the equivalent meal. 
Maybe I'll go here once a year and from now on I'll use the drive thru instead of walking inside. It's just a little bit 3rd worldy inside."}
{"text":"I'm a teacher and brought some students here during a school function. The manager overheard one of my students say he didn't have any money, and even though I was going to cover it, he stepped in and covered him. He also checked on us, offered to refill drinks and made sure everything was clean after. Friendliest guy ever, way to take pride in where you work and make the atmosphere great!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Taco Bell spot in this area.  By far the better Taco Bell in this and the surrounding zip codes.  Taco Bell is my favorite fast food chain.  All the other Taco Bells nearby around here are gross and trashy."}
{"text":"Short and simple. The tacos are good and this location is always clean. The employees are usually friendly. 

Their drive thru line is always long!"}
{"text":"Once again its 7:30 in the morning and they aren't open there's not even an employee on site. This location is notorious for not opening up on time. I've emailed corporate with no response. I will be calling them next."}
{"text":"Constantly forgetting food in the drive thru. Waited 45 minutes for chicken one day. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. I went through the drive through and my order was messed up. Then I went inside and they messed it up two more times. They moved with no sense of urgency whatsoever and I was left waiting for quite a while. Not to mention, I was not compensated in anyway nor did I receive a refund. Very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"As a (former) fan of Taco Bell, I'm sad to to have to write this review. Tonight, my friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal at your restaurant. Unfortunately, it ended up being a horrible experience. As someone who cannot eat dairy and chooses not to eat meat, I was extremely careful in describing what I wanted: a burrito with no cheese and no beef. The cashier repeated it back to me at least 3 times, so I was confident she understood what I wanted. After getting our meal, I bit into my burrito to discover it consisted SOLEY of beef and cheese. I'm extremely saddened and sick by this encounter and only hope that you can improve for future patrons. Also, I know it's not this location's personal fault, but the diablo sauce sucks."}
{"text":"Poor customer service by Viet, scolding an employee in front of a customer for making a mistake and then he repeats my order via the drive- thru and got it completely wrong and I had to go inside and get my order and when I arrived home    there was a ton of sour cream which I specifically said zero sour cream."}
{"text":"As far as TB's go, this one is legit. The late night staff knows how to pile on the portions!  Supa Chulupa does it for me!"}
{"text":"Went to drive thru and order #6 and asked for chicken and a steak chalupas, got my orders checked and got everything, so when i got home and took a bite of my chalupas it was beef not even steak or chicken that I have asked. This is the second time that they messed up my orders. This is the night shift ppl with that Asian dude on the drive thru."}
{"text":"These guys are rock stars. The food they make for us are always very special orders and they make it an artwork. Love this Taco Bell! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I just had the pleasure of ordering through the drive thru window at Taco Bell in Westlake from a young man named Devon. I haven't even eaten my food and it was by far the best fast food experience I have had in years. He was the most polite and efficient, hard worker I have seen at a chain fast food restaurant in YEARS. I hope the management realizes  what they have there. I rarely write reviews, but I was inspired by this young man. go Devon!"}
{"text":"Prepare to wait a long long time.  Was in the drive thru for 2 items.. Waited another 5 minutes once I got to the drive thru window, all for a total of 30 minutes. Unacceptable. Never again."}
{"text":"You know what you are getting from the food, which I tend to like but the rating is more for the location.  Service is very slow at this location and this time, actually waited 20 minutes as I was stuck in the drive thru  lane with no way to exit.  That did not seem to motivate the workers to move any quicker. Also, cleanliness is a concern.  Avoid this location."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is hit or miss. I LOVE Taco Bell and this is the only location I have ever not enjoyed. It seems that the afternoon/evening shift is the best time to go but still, it's hit and miss for me. They often forget my sauce packets, the 7 layer burrito is more often than not 2 layers of just guac and sour cream with a tiny bit of beans, the bean burritos almost never have cheese. It is very close to where I live so I have gone multiple times and will probably go again many times but it's not my favorite Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Finally this Taco Bell got a remodel it was falling apart. Next thing that needs a remodel is the employees. I know it's Taco Bell so I'm not expecting much from the employee but every time I go inside the front people are rude and it's like I'm putting them out for ordering my nachos. I'm giving it a 4 star because it's tb, so I'm not expecting world class service. 
I have a weakness for Taco Bell. Other than the crappy service the food is always good. My girl and I love coming here cause we get our cravings. I'm all for the quesorito and nachos belgrande no beans. I'll keep coming back to Taco Bell because of the food not the service. Thanks Taco Bell! And thanks for remodeling this dump!"}
{"text":"I don't like fast food but I love Taco Bell. Cheap and delish. Service is pretty good for a fast food joint. I get my random Taco Bell cravings and it's close to home so I always hit up the drive through and get my delicious food hot and fast. I'll keep coming back to this location because I've never had any issues.
Years later I'm still loving this Taco Bell. Normally at fast food places you get meh service but not this Taco Bell. Always great. My food is always awesome (as it can be for Taco Bell). I'll definitely keep coming to this spot"}
{"text":"We ate inside. I really like how it's decorated in here. Food was good and service was good. I really wanted the Baja Blast but they were out syrup so that sucked but aside from that it was good. I like eating inside this Taco Bell it's pretty lol"}
{"text":"The service was great! The food is ver delicious and very accessible since it was near the mall! Everybody should try Taco Bell especially the chicken cheese and rice burritos."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy Taco Bell normally more than any of the other fast food restaurants, but not this location. Slowest service ever, many times poorly made food as well."}
{"text":"what can i say its a taco bell lol nothing fancy, a tad on the busy side. came with the husband and 3 kids, had a couple who looked to be in their late 40s maybe 50s say some rude ass shit about how many tacos we got, uh hello i have 3 kids to feed 2 of them who are 8 and 9 year old boys so if my getting 12-14 tacos was too much in your eyes well then you can stuff a taco down ya mouth and choke on it. seemed the people that visit this taco bell are a tad on the rude and uppity up snotty type people. sorry my having 3 kids make your long johns slivers fish meal so unpleasant that you had to sit there and stare and make rude comments under your breath and talk crap to my husband on the way out. over all i would have gave it 3 maybe 4 stars but the people here make it a crappy visit!"}
{"text":"This is the worst taco bell in Arizona orders are always incorrect and workers don't follow sanitary food service I watched the guy at the window pick his ear I will never return to this dump period ."}
{"text":"Chalupa, double decker, supreme, nacho fries! These are all on Taco Bell's huge menu with a big variety of satisfying your fast food cravings. Went here last night for a quick meal and service was great with very little waiting time. I was the only one in the drive thru so it was a quick no hassle meal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The best taco bell in arizona.....always fresh....I'm glad I'm not a drive thru person cuz it's always packed"}
{"text":"Used the drive through for my son tonight. Line was short but it took and exceptional amount of time to get us through the line. When ordering I confirmed we did NOT want tomatoes or sour cream on our items. My son hates them! They read the order back and stated the correct order. But guess what we had on our items....tomatoes and sour cream.  We were already home when he noticed so we didn't take them back. But confirming an order twice and still making a mistake is not ok or good customer service."}
{"text":"There was one person ahead of me at the register and one person in the drive through and they got all of our orders wrong even after the three staff behind the counter stared and stuttered at each other for twenty minutes."}
{"text":"Today. I decided to become a Yelper. Now, I don't want to sound dramatic. And I usually don't ever rate anything. But today I was disappointed. Taco Bell is my favorite, hands down of all fast food. Today I was really craving a XXL Grilled Steak Stuffed Burrito. Now don't let me steer you wrong. I'm not trying to make it sound like I haven't had it in a while. I actually had it last night. But that's my point. I LOVE Taco Bell. I grew up on Taco Bell. 1. Burrito Supreme, soft taco w/ sour cream. 

Well... Today's burrito was just nasty... and I know what a XXL Grilled steak stuffed burrito is suppose to taste like. I loved it so much last night I decided I was going to have it again today for lunch. And it just, did. Not. Hit. The. Spot. The taste was just... off. And overall not appetizing. The sauce was off. It was just the taste of beans bite after bite.... I buy every meal with expectations. Fast food money doesn't grow on trees, so I want every meal to hit the spot. I was expecting greatness when all those flavor combinations hit my tongue. (Cause that's all Taco Bell is. Flavor combos. Lol) But instead I got plain bean burrito. FUN. What a waste of 6 bucks. 

I give it 3 stars, cause I'm still coming back. Perhaps the next location will be better."}
{"text":"I normally come to this location and the food and service is pretty good. I'm a server myself, so I totally understand when things get busy, however, I have currently been in the drive thru line for 36 minutes. This is an actual joke. Do not come here after 1 am unless you want to wait an hour for tacos."}
{"text":"For the past 3 times I've come here, I've waited for 15-20 min in drive through. And each time I can't turn around because there's a car behind me. Insanely insanely insanely slow crew

Update: management here needs to be replaced. Holy cow, this Taco Bell is slow."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell, so it's different and good but sometimes the experience could be better. I went for breakfast this morning and got the AM Crunchwrap with bacon, egg and cheese. 

It was good but my bacon was missing from it until I got down to the last few bites, which were all bacon. Would have been better if it wasn't just hidden until the end. Most of my visits are great, but the breakfast crew needs to do better at preparation. Also, you can't blame the fact that it was busy as I was literally the only person there in the drive-through line, the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Friendly employees. Food always comes out as ordered & very timely. No bad experiences with this location."}
{"text":"It was around 7ish in the evening on 10/3 when \"it\" happened. I had had a distressing phone conversation that left me crying before I went through the drive thru to get a quick dinner for myself  and my son. After I had paid at the window and received my order, the amazing team member handed me a caramel empanada and told me \" I threw in this empanada because it looked like I need something sweet\". 
Thank you so much to the observant and  caring Taco Bell team member- you made a positive and significant impact on a customer tonight. It's beautiful to see that there are still humans that care about others.

Thank you."}
{"text":"Probably one of the cleanest, most polite taco bells we've been to.  The staff gets our order right pretty much every time, which is light years ahead of many others we've been to."}
{"text":"As a restaurant owner I want to give props to the nice lady in the drive thru.  She was able to upscale and make me want what she was offering.  She was amazing!  Didn't catch her name but she had blond hair!  The food was what it was Taco Bell!  But she rocked!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service and my order is never wrong, they don't check IDs when you use your card though"}
{"text":"Stay away from this taco bell!!!   You will often be waiting in the drive thru for over 20 minutes for a simple order. 

One time, I attempted to order, but the drive thru speaker was broken, so with cars behind me I attempted to pull forward and order in the window after waiting 10 minutes. They informed me I could not get my order processed and would have to go inside. After saying I already waited for 10 minutes, the employee responded \"Man, I'm not the manager, don't give me shit.\" 

Rude, dirty, and low quality even for a taco bell.  Go to the Taco bell on Neil St. instead, they are 35939395 times better."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? From the moment the ladies and I walked into this location, we were excitedly greeted by Jason B. His enthusiasm to take our order and make sure we were well taken care of was suburb. The interior was super clean and well lit. The other workers who handed us our food was just as equally outgoing. Jason even went above and Beyond to walk us out our food to our table. A+ for everything!"}
{"text":"I paid for extra cheese and add tomatoes. A $14.00 combo turned into $25.00. I'm ok with that. What I'm not ok with is that not even half the tacos I paid for had the extras I paid for. Seriously? $10.00 more and still can't get it right. I don't eat fast food often at all, but this is disappointing when a chain restaurant can't competently complete what I would consider a straight forward order. Hey Taco Bell company, do you even give a shit!? Look at all Yelp reviews for this location and maybe look generally at your global scheme"}
{"text":"We got there at 9:59 and they still let us come in and eat indoors even though they had already mopped the place.  Good food...it's Taco Bell, and the staff was cool. Had never had the dorito taco, so i got the $5 combo box with that, a burrito and another regular taco.  Was good.  I was expecting more from the dorito taco tastewise, but it didn't taste bad or anything."}
{"text":"Takes forever to get your food and 3 times in a row I didn't get what I ordered, always under staffed and sometimes don't know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This was overall a good experience. I was doing an Uber trip and it brought me to Gastonia. I am glad that I stopped in. All of my items were full as opposed to some of the other Taco Bell's that I have visited. The cashier was the manager on duty. She was very pleasant. A small complaint is that there were not clean tables in the dining room. All of the tables that did not have a customer at then had food or other debris on the tables."}
{"text":"This place used to be good for being fast food but I've found so many hairs and unknown objects in my food every time I drive by this place I wanna throw up. I threw up about 9 times like the exorcist after eating here and never ate here again."}
{"text":"Polite staff.....and two (and a half?) Words..... Cinnabun bites.

They are mire like warm cream puffs than cinnabuns, but I am sad that they only come four to an order, and happy that they are served all day."}
{"text":"I will never be back to this taco bell in gastonia. They did not have the change that i needed and where Rude. Lazy People that work there"}
{"text":"I'm upset. Went to taco bell on a casual friday night with the girls. Got 4 baja blast freezes, a chicken quesadilla with a side of sour cream, and two supreme tacos with no meat. When we got home, we discovered that we received the complete wrong order. The taco we received had a hair in it, and the mexican pizza was complete dismembered and looked like a mexican salad. Truly a disgrace and should never be served any individual. We went back and got our right order, but our appetite was lost at the sights of these horrendous creations. We should be reimbursed for the gas fee and the toll on the environment we caused by having to go back. Taco Bell, feel hot shame."}
{"text":"Its taco bell. As taco bells go, this location is second in my opinion to the taco bell on 67th and happy valley. As far as fast food goes, taco bell is by far the best bang for your buck and tastes light years better than any burger place."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here the staff are very friendly and seem to enjoy their job. I always order the steak quesarito and it is always awesome. Thanks for providing great service."}
{"text":"I wish you served breakfast!  Some do and its really fair priced and good. This location doesn't but they never mess up my lunch or dinner order so ill take that. they sell pizza hut too, very pricy for small pizza and breadsticks."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Taco Bell. I've come to this one frequently when I'm out late at night either at Spokes or Xtreme Bean. The staff has always been unbelievably kind and friendly to me, and have countlessly fixed mistakes either made by themselves or the consumer. I recommend this Taco Bell to anyone in the area or traveling thru."}
{"text":"Yes i love taco bell. Usually.. but today it was terrble, this rating is for this particular location,  for this particular visit. Drive thru, took way too long,  pretty sure it was the vehicle in front but the window clerk should have been apologetic to the other customers,  just kinda had a whatever attitude. Speaker was messed up so our order wasn't right either. Just disappointed in my bell . :("}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Never have I been in a taco bell where everyone is extremely nice and polite. Store is always clean. The employees definitely make my day even just by smiling :) keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I went in the drive thru & it was busy. I ordered like 5 things off the menu & they forgot to make my nachos :( 
But i turned right back around & they were very nice & even gave me an extra burrito! Everything was delicious. I go for their mountain dew blast soda & awesome crunchwraps !"}
{"text":"Lunch time. 1 staff in kitchen. 1 staff at counter. Staff unfamiliar with the menu and computer. 10 mins in line with no movement. While these two could pick up the pace, chances are its poor management."}
{"text":"Typical Taco Bell food served by really nice people. Wow! Not your usual Taco Bell. 

I asked one of the staff last week how come you guys are so nice, you're always smiling and happy. The cashier said that the manager only hires people who are friendly and cheerful! Awesome!  Let's clone these people.

Great place to stop for a quick meal before or after a visit to the dam."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Not only was our food cold but our food had more lettuce and barley any meat. So gross. This was my second time coming here in hopes it'll be better than the first experience which it wasn't. Don't waste your time and especially your money. Starting to realize most these food chains around here are crap."}
{"text":"Great service here! When Jack is working the window everything is always perfect. He makes sure your taken care of, always with a smile on his face! Nice people make your eating experience and mood change completely!!! I would give this location 5 stars if they didn't close earlier than normal Taco Bells. They are my closest location from home..."}
{"text":"I arrived at this Taco Bell at noon.   Placed my order at 12:13pm and got my food at 12:33.  I came to try the new cool ranch taco and received  regular Doritos taco.   When I tried to tell the man (he looked like the manager) who have me my food he said \"this looks like yours\".  I said, \"I ordered the cool ranch taco box\".  He replied, \"you want a box?\".  I said forget it and walked away. When I sat down to eat my food, it seemed as though it had been sitting for awhile.  The bottoms of the tacos were soggy and falling apart and the food was cold.  Don't get me wrong, I have realistic expectations for fast food at Taco Bell but this was pretty horrible even by those standards."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better Taco Bells I have been to, the service is usually pretty fast. The employees are cheerful and dish out good manners. It's always clean inside, as well as the bathrooms. And when it is busy they are usually on top of keeping the tables clean. Drive thru is also pretty quick as well. If you are in the mood for tacos and are in the area I recommend stopping at this Taco Bell, it is also a Long John Silvers so if tacos is not what you want you can have some fish"}
{"text":"Super authentic Sonoran cuisine. Impeccable service. Ménage of flavor. You win again Taco Bell. Watch out for the fire sauce #fuegoarse."}
{"text":"This taco bell is great, every time I come here people are so polite and happy. They do an awesome job"}
{"text":"Literally the best experience(S) I've had at a drive thru! Not only was I offered a drink for the wait, but offered me the burrito that was wrongly made for the person in front of me! The drink offer has happened before because I go to this Taco Bell often. Anyway! Just thought I'd mention this store and how the service is exceptional! Thank you Taco Bell 031864! Breanna was my cashier! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Taco Bell's around. More like a crack house. Save yourself and go to the one on Niel street."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Taco Bell ever. The floors appear to have never been moped. The kitchen looks like an absolute disaster. The food is just about as bad with slimy lettuce. This place is in desperate need of a remodel and new management."}
{"text":"We work near here so go here quite a few times. Actually really like. Staff are really friendly and the food always tastes great. You can be in and out within 10 minutes which is always good also."}
{"text":"This location always fucks up my order. Every time I ask to modify, they always charge extra and never do what I ask. This location is terrible."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Taco Bell in the history of the United States of America. Not only do they consistently have the outside lights turned off (causing any potential customers to play a game of \"are they closed?\"), But when you pull up to the speaker you are treated like an idiot. The breakfast shift is wonderful, but as they say \"the freaks come out at night\". I'm sure my food get spit in every time I idiotically choose to patronize this trash heap of an establishment. 

It seems as if this taco HELL is competing with the Popeyes next door for the title of \"most ratchet-trash-disrespectful\" restaurant in the entire universe. The ineptitude is the stuff of legend. They have to actually TRY do this bad. I feel like an idiot for ever stopping. I'll go to Macedonia and drive 30 minutes out of my way before I ever approach this franchise again. I would literally die of hunger before I ever step foot in this place. Don't do it. Please don't do it. I'm sure they don't mop."}
{"text":"Great food with a smile I haven't had a good experience with Taco Bell in quite a while the food actually tastes good and the girl at the drive-through was very nice"}
{"text":"Can't beat Taco Bell fast drive through fresh food accurate order smiling faces I will always come back to this location when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"My friend and I were greeted very enthusiastically by Riley, best customer service I've had at a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. I'm still sitting in line waiting for my food. It's been literally 20 min. They didn't even have what I wanted (it's the middle of the day, how do you run out of commonly ordered food items?) and this is the second time in a few months that's happened to me. Two employees came to the window when it was my turn to pay and both ignored me before a third finally showed up and took my payment, same woman who is taking orders. I still don't have my food..... going on 25min.... 25 min and my FAST food meal still isn't ready?! They're not even busy. The line is because of how slow they're moving. The parking lot doesn't have many cars and there is no line inside (I can see) CLEARLY I should've just gone inside. Instead I will just never come back. No one even apologized for the wait. Which means that's just how they run. See ya never.



Update: not that anyone's surprised but my food is ice cold. It takes 3 min to get home from that location sooooo it didn't get cold in the car. I wish I could give negative stars. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Never really  considered The Bell for fast food breakfast items, but I was pleasantly surprised. The crunchwrap with sausage and a hash brown patty inside was really tasty. The little cinnamon rolls were good too. Definitely a nice change from McDonalds and definitely better than The King's offerings."}
{"text":"So you know how some restaurants charge you up the Wazoo for \"extra\" this or that?
Well I ordered a side of extra shredded cheese, tomatoes and pizza sauce and I was only charged 60 cents extra! They filled up each ramican to the very top and did not screw me! There food is great for Fast Food Mexican, I've been eating there every since I got my baby teeth and still love it!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this location unless you're okay with in waiting the drive-thru for atleast 20 minutes.  Apparently a malfunction of some kind at their location caused a huge wait in the drive through on my visit; I was stuck for 20 minutes and only got an \"I'm sorry for the wait\" when I FINALLY got to the window.

I was so angry about my experience that I even did the survey on the back of the receipt. I doubt anyone will follow up about it, but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I will NOT return to this location. Every single time my husband or I have gone, there's been an issue.

This location is a train wreck."}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing a taco bell? I've been bar hopping and have to get up for work in 6 hours. Bless you 24hr taco bell, where else can you order the whole right side of menu for $10???? Tonite I salute the brave workers dealing with drunks and those getting their munchies on, BRAVO"}
{"text":"Avoid this Taco Bell at all cost. Do NOT give this place any business whatsoever. They have some of the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. There is one worker in particular his name is Sean. He is rude and doesn't care about making the customer happy. Very unprofessional! I was going to spend a decent amount of money there by buying all my co workers food mind you I have 15 co workers. And thanks to Mr. Sean I didn't spend one penny nor do I plan to ever again. I've been going to Taco Bell for many years now and I never have I got treated the way I did at this one. I guess home is where the heart is because at my local Taco Bell on 30th St and Thomas I always get the best service. It's a shame that the employees at this Bell location have no idea what they are doing. Even as I spoke to the manager he wasn't of any help. He didn't care to take care of the situation and ignored me. Its okay though I rather go give my business to Filibertos who serve actual Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience at this location. My order is always correct, and the wait time is minimal, the food is also great."}
{"text":"Freshest Taco Bell I've been too. I order a cheesy gordita crunch meal and a crunch wrap supreme and it was all fresh!!"}
{"text":"I wish you would properly train all your employees on how to maintain proper bean consistency as well as teach them how to properly roll a buritto. I have to re-roll my burrito everytime I come here. They're always loose and stuff falls out. Tight is right!! Now get it right please.... oh and don't forget to teach them how to spread the ingredients through the whole burrito. One time my first bite into a burrito was all onions.... your job isn't that hard, if you want $15 and hour you better produce the best burrito I've ever seen."}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell ever. They never ever get your food right at the drive-through I've been going there for years and everybody in my family that goes there knows if you don't check your bag at the drive-through and tell them what you're missing you will go home without something they always screw up is the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to and continues to not get better"}
{"text":"Bad. These guys can't even make a combo of 3 taco supremes. One taco was beef and tomato on an old taco shell that I'm sure spent time on the floor. The imature girl at the window was a giggling idiot."}
{"text":"Have not eaten at a Taco Bell in years after seeing all the commercials, decided to give this one a try. Ordered the Taco Supreme & basically got what appeared to be a vegetarian taco. There was perhaps a hint of meat at the base, a bit of lettuce, three red cubes that I assume was tomato, some cheese that gave them a hint of yellow, no sour cream. (Had to ask for it) all for the bargain price of 7.91. I'm still hungry so now I need to go to McDonald's for 2 singles."}
{"text":"Didn't get my quesadilla and my bean burritos both had lettuce n tomatoes and all I asked for was no onions and my cinnamon balls were old af got home ad was so disappointed it's now been the third time in a row they messed up my order  least I got my taco  right"}
{"text":"Terrible. Longest wait in a drive thru ever. Just to find out they forgot to put things in the bag. The only thing I can count on from this TB is bad service. Always messing up the order."}
{"text":"Comparing to \"other\" Taco Bells, this is one of the best I have been too.  The store is clean, the menu offers all the usual Taco Bell foods, and the staff is generally friendly.  From the items I have ordered from the menu, I haven't had any issue where portions were less than expected.  Likewise with special orders made like \"easy onion\" or \"no red sauce,\" I have yet to return an item to the counter to have it fixed.  So overall I give it five stars."}
{"text":"I admit that I like the Steak Chalupa's at Taco Bell and this location is the closest one to where I work. Usually I do the drive thru unless it's crowded and then I'll pop inside and order. Today I decided to try the Taco Bell App that they advertise with posters plastered all over the store and on commercials on t.v. I have to say, I was not impressed. The app was tough to use and after I finally got the order placed, I had to wait in the store.
First the app. Granted I'm not a computer geek but I've played enough computer games in my day to figure things out pretty well and this app is not very intuitive. I was impressed that I had a coupon good for $2 off a purchase of $10 (which is a lot of food for one person at TB!) but there were no clear directions on how to use it. Once I figured that out (you have to choose it first and then place your order) I had to figure out how to order what I wanted. That was a little easier but still took a few tries to figure it out. Finally got my order ready, went to check out and got a message that the coupon couldn't be used and read the restrictions....which I could not find. I'm guessing that the local Taco Bell wouldn't take them, so I had to start over.
Finally got the order placed (you might want to enter your credit card info at the very beginning through the application menu) and a screen pops up asking if you're picking up in the drive-thru or in store. I clicked on the drive-thru and received a message to wait on choosing an option until I'm close to or in the store. When I arrived about 10 minutes after placing the order, and based on the very long drive-thru line, I pulled over, clicked on 'In Store' and I'm here, and then parked. 
I went inside and there is a special line just for app placed orders. the gentleman behind the counter was very quick to ask if I wanted to place an order and I mentioned I'd placed it via the app and was just waiting. Then I waited....and waited...and waited...and watched all the cars that had been in line at the drive-thru, place and pick up all their orders before I got mine. I was all the way out to my car by the time I realized that I was supposed to get a drink with my meal, which was part of the ordering process, and had to go back in to get that.
The overall process will probably go more quickly the next time around but the amount of time that I spent placing my order, and then waiting when I got there, kind of defeated the purpose of the app.
I will say that I do like going to this Taco Bell location. The place is always clean, the employees are friendly (especially the lady that works the drive-thru window most days), and the food is always good. While it doesn't look quite like the commercials on t.v., it's a lot closer in comparison to what the burger chains show you and what's delivered. I also like the fact that when you eat in, you can get refills on your drink and top it off before you leave.
I gave 4 stars for the location and employees however, if I were to include the app in the overall review (which would not be fair), I'd have to give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is an embarrassment. Walked in and the attitudinal lady worker there tells me I have to wait 20 minutes for my food. No sorry or can I take your order. Meanwhile she's standing there doing nothing. Scum ppl that want $10/hr. Beware of this crap hole!"}
{"text":"So, first before anything, I want to address this is a Taco Bell so I'm not expecting 5 star service. And I want to give credit where credit is due, and say unlike many other locations, this one has never messed up an order. And I want to mention, I have ordered from both the fixed price menu and the value menu- in store and through the drive through. Whatever I order from the fixed price menu is fixed \"properly\" and by that I mean in comparison to the value items- which are anemic and obviously thrown together sloppily. The customer service could use some work as well when it comes to special orders. I have no problem paying more, they just seem to have an issue with it. The customer service I received was subpar and could use some work, especially the manager I saw today."}
{"text":"Ok so I decide to eat inside this place!
Go to the counter and wait 10 min. Just for someone to come to the register!
Then the guy has a attitude cause I asked for no lettuce !
I will order my food how I like it! 
And do not expect no one to have a attitude about it! 
So I just left I don't have time for that!
If you do not care for your job quit!
There are people out here who need a job!
Bad choice from management to let this guy run the register! Slow and Rude not my favorite combination!"}
{"text":"Great place to take date. New design is great and lovely setting for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"The employees? are pretty rude to be honest. More than once with different people I've been given rude service. Either teenagers or old crack heads."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about the Taco Bell on Bagley Road. I went last night around 9:30 pm and the cashier informed me that they were out of beef! How does a company whose main export is beef tacos run out of beef? On top of that the cashier told me that she \"normally wouldn't charge me extra for the steak substitution, but she can't because of inventory.\"  When I politely suggested that she ring it up as steak and then discount me the $5 for the substitution she just shrugged and walked away. I found her explanation to be poor but, there is no question that there is an inventory problem at this location.

Typically my budget for tacos is $5 and now I had to purchase $5 in upgrades that I didn't want. That would be like Amazon running out of books and then suggesting that I buy magazines for twice the amount I planned to spend instead. I'm very unhappy with my experience at this Taco Bell and will not be going back."}
{"text":"This location has the worst service. 20 minutes waiting for a taco salad and potato wedges. I wish they would get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Well, the cashier was awesome. but it was weird having to wait 16 mins total for two supreme tacos and two soft. excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it doesn't fly."}
{"text":"So either you like Taco Bell or you are a communist, so I won't waste any of this review trying to explain to you how awesome beefy 5 layer burritos are, I will just talk about this location.

Pros
- its basically always empty around 4th meal time so you never have to wait in line
-the staff seems to get only medium high while at work, compared to most taco bells where they get Greatful Dead concert level high- this results in a lot less screw ups in your order- yay for moderation. 
-the food comes out warm- not hot like a real big boy restaurant- but not the cold gross beans you get at many taco bells after 11 when they have long since stopped caring

Cons
-it is like a 2 minute drive further away than 2 other taco bells and my time is valuable- those Hello Ladies reruns aren't going to watch themselves
-I love Mountain Dew, mainly because I'm an extreme sports athlete- however I HATE baja blast. The Mountain Dew at this location always tastes a little Baja Blasty which sucks"}
{"text":"Since the renovations completed a few weeks ago this place just is awesome now with the KFC addition. Def a change from the dumpy old interior they had since this place was built! Food quality is still good not to mention the prices, it is a little smaller seating wise but it is more meant for take out anyways considering the location of the place."}
{"text":"I come here regularly for tacos and beans burritos for lunch since it is close to work and quick. There is a girl that is working the drive thru almost every time I come and she is super nice and is honestly the reason I come back. Fast food workers can be so rude and cold sometimes so it's a really nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Our order was mostly right. The food was okay the folks were nice but it would have been a lot easier if the staff spoke English."}
{"text":"This TB is really bad, complete water damaged ceilings. The bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned since the building was built. You are lucky to actually get good service, 1 out of 5 times you'll get exactly what you order and with nothing missing. The response from all the employees and manager is just \"sorry about that\" 

Don't bothering going to the drive thru if you don't wanna park to tell them they forgot half your meal and they gave you the completely wrong order. 

I'm choosing to go to a TB 10 mins away because they have 10 out of 10 service."}
{"text":"Boy I was looking forword to some tacos. Got them and boy what a disappointment as you can see from the picture you got more shell them meat,cheese or lettuce. And we didnt even get offered hot sauce and didn't notice until we took our 12 pack home. Not a cheap order but I  see me trying del taco next time."}
{"text":"Came through for a salad and a couple of burritos.. One car ahead and we sat for almost 20 min before they got there food.. Cant say they ordered alot only saw 2 bags being passed to them.. 
The salad was good but, the shell it was in was not.. It tasted like it was fried in Old cooking oul!! Yuck!! Needless to say was already home eating it and was to tired to take it back so it sucked!!
We may go back and try it again maybe it was an off day"}
{"text":"Rude service!! Went thru drive thru and was never said hi too. Just a hand do we can pay.. As we were paying we did give 5.00 in coins and we told her it was and she drops of portion on the ground. Tried to pick it up and it landed in someones spit etc. she never said sorry for dropping it just opened window for an expectant .75 she dropped.. She then proceeded to toss our bags of burritos at us and we had to wait for our soda cause She forgot!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the new Dorito Lacos Taco. It was OK, however, I expected the shell to actually taste like the cheesy Dortio chips. It was still good-ish, but not overly-whelming good as they show in those snazzy commercials. I'm having hopes that the Cool Ranch Dorito Taco will have more flavor."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has the best drive thru customer service I have ever experienced at a fast food chain. The food quality is what you would generally expect out of a Taco Bell. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Used the drive thru last weekend. Not a good experience. The guy taking the orders was not friendly. I ordered the #4 combo and they only gave me three sauces. Seriously? I need 3 just for the pizza. No fork, no napkins. I will go to the one down the road from now on."}
{"text":"The food is what you expect, but that's why you're there! Love the Fries Supreme regardless its nutritional content. Meximelts or Gordita Crunch are my go-to when I get a craving.

There aren't many locations around, so I can't compare, but this has THE slowest drive thru. I stop here a few times a year and each time, I've put my car in Park. At least they're consistent, right?"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell...cheap filling food when you have a craving. This particular location though has a habit of its employees playing music that is less than desirable in the eating area. Headbanger...or rap....
When i look at the CUSTOMER Base...it is not millennials or young urban kids...it is 40 plus people. A mix of music should be played or dah...why not Mexican Themed Music. All I want to do is get out of there...go home and kick the dog after eating inside."}
{"text":"You get what is expected.  Cheap wanna be mexican food.  I basically go to Taco bell because I can eat for less than 6 bucks.  I do love the Mexican Pizza though and nobody else currently sells anything like it that I know of in fast food."}
{"text":"Normal Taco Bell food, no complaints there. But the service was awful. They got our order wrong. And 3 cars from the drive thru came in while we were eating and their orders were screwed up too. Time to hire some new expeditors Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"I really don't like getting back to the office and finding out they forgot my nachos.....i cannot just get in the car and drive back - i will not be eating here anymore because the service is poor."}
{"text":"I agree with the other review. I've never felt the need to rate a Taco Bell, but tonight is that exception. Terribly slow and no sense of urgency. There are 12 of us currently standing in line, we've already ordered, but just waiting for our food. Worst service yet."}
{"text":"I give four stars here because this is definitely one of the better Taco Bells. Syan was my server today and she was very friendly and had a big smile. I ordered the $5 box with cheesy double beef burrito, Doritos Taco, and regular taco and it comes with a drink. Not too many places you can get a filling meal and drink for $5. It's clean inside and the decor is inviting. I do, however, know from experience to come inside as the drive thru can be a bit slow. Other than that a great choice if you like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a fast bite to eat before I go to work. Kelly was great! She greeted me and took my order. Best part, she had a smile. Once I got my food and sat down, I notice there was no music playing. So it felt weird eating my food in a quiet area with other people around. Also hearing them eat their food. Not only that, you can hear all the employees in the back of the house talking about their personal life. So because of that, my satisfaction during my time here was not okay. Other than that, the food was great."}

{"text":"Probably one of the best Taco Bells I go to. The staff is always friendly and they make small talk. They are quick as well."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Taco Bells! I live .5 miles away so I am frequent visitor to the bell. Whether its dine in or drive thru this location is always quality. The staff is friendly, service is great, and food is always quality. And it goes without saying every new item is always on point!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I will never go to this Taco Bell again even though I'll have to go 15 minutes farther to get to a different one. I went to this one a few times and each time they go comically slow and do not apologize and move like snails."}
{"text":"I work down the road from this Taco Bell and have been here MANY times over the last few years.  Why many times?.....better than 99% of other Taco Bell locations I've been too. Service is almost always quick and friendly, the restaurant is kept clean, the food is good and it's cheap.  On a few occasions when they've been super busy the food was slow coming out but it wasn't due to the staff not working their tails off.....you can clearly see them working a few feet from the counter.  Would recommend checking this location out if you haven't already....bet you'll agree it's a cut above most other Bell's you've been to."}
{"text":"I went there after a long day and Laura G was simply amazing  she was kind and welcomed us when we came in. She was helpful and went out of her way to make our lunch great!"}
{"text":"So this place seems to have turned it around. No longer waiting 25 minutes to get your food. I can see they hired new people, and they are friendly. 
It is still fast food, but I had to get rid of the previous 1 star as they have changed."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.... same crap served a dz different ways . Still one of the only drive thu places worth going to when in a pinch"}
{"text":"Don't go here after dark. Unless you enjoy disappointments that is. Food is normally either burnt or not done correctly."}
{"text":"It's average, ok? It's no McCormick's and it's no hole in the wall. The food is typically what you'll find at any other fast food joint and the service is nothing to rave about.

Taco Bell just sounds bomb at 1:30am sometimes. Don't judge."}
{"text":"They just don't listen......have been there several times at night and it seems that regardless how I order my meal which is usually without tomatoes....they always put them on there anyway. If I go now it's for kicks and giggles only.....if they get my order right then I'm having a good night"}
{"text":"I wrote my previous review when I was hangry.. I didn't mean it. This place always does me good as far as Taco Bell goes, and the people working are always pretty cool :)

Previous review: 
Went to Taco Bell.. asked if I wanted any sauce.. Said I wanted sauce..

No sauce..

NO STARS!!"}
{"text":"I rarely go into Taco Bell, but had to try the new Stuft Nacho thing they invented. The commercials always get me to try the new stuff that fast food chains are rolling out. It has a strange triangular shape and clearly tastes likes nachos all wrapped up in that tortilla, but near the end it gets messy and your thinking, \"why did I order this\" instead of just getting real nachos.It's only 2 bucks and the chips are inside, but they are tortilla strips and everything else in there has been seen before. It's creative, but falls short of being something that you need to eat more than once."}
{"text":"Drove past this gem and saw it was leveled.  AZs culinary status just fell down a couple notches today.  All of those workers who can't earn a livable wage just became even more unlivable."}
{"text":"Below average taco bell experience. Long wait time for order. Customers screaming profanity the whole time and management just ignored it. Verrry slow and inattentive staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a soft taco,  hard taco, and the doritos taco and the only taco that was decent was the hard taco. The Doritos one fell apart and was horrible while the soft taco was harder then the hard taco,  and the atmosphere was bad all the employees were in the back yelling and horseplaying around."}
{"text":"It's your typical Taco Bell. Admittedly, I don't eat fast food as often as I used to - in fact, I try to avoid it. 

I was out of the office all day and didn't pack a lunch for work - so I had to figure out what to eat. I ended up deciding on Taco Bell because it would be cheap, it's close to the office, and I could order small servings. 

I got two tacos and a small drink. 

Nothing was spectacular about the location, building, price, taste... what was spectacular was the service at the drive through window. The guy working the window that day (8/4/15 - between 1 - 130PM) was very energetic, happy, polite, etc. His mood was expressed through the speakers and through the interaction with him at the window. If I were ever debating on which location to go to, or which fast food place to go to out of convenience or necessity - he would be the determining factor."}
{"text":"The Taco Bell is the foods okay and it is not that good like other fast food restaurant, but it is alright stop by try something different from other fast food places."}
{"text":"There are homeless people everywhere in here.

Other than that, this is Taco Bell and you know the drill."}
{"text":"I am impressed by the turn around here. I walk in to a clean restaurant and quick accurate service. This location is back to being what a Taco Bell should be."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Yes I know it is Taco Bell and it is fast food but can I get a bag of chips that is not two years past expiration. It is July of 2017 and my chips expired in Aug of 2015. Seriously... I call the store to let them know in a non confrontational way and the managers simply told me ok I will let them know. Didn't offer anything too me for customer service sake. When I first moved to Charlotte 4 years ago this was one of the best TBs in town. It is certainly the worst now. Do better guys, come on!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell/KFC ever! The drive-through is always super slow. They always get your order wrong or they are always out of something."}
{"text":"5 times now in a week I've tried to get the new watermelon freeze and for some odd reason its broken.......but someone in the drive thru line a head of me had gotten one???"}
{"text":"I love the dollar menu here. The spicy potato tacos are awesome. I always get them. The cheesy bean and cheese burritos are good too. Fire hot sauce is good here. Not much else i can say. It's not the best mexican food but it's cheap and fast. It's great for what it is. I dig it."}
{"text":"Just came here and they said \"manager\" was cleaning out the grill and they can't serve Taco Bell but they can serve KFC. I asked for manager's name and they wouldn't give me that info. Also, I thought Taco Bell has everything frozen and they would just put it in a microwave. At the end they did agree to make me my food cause some how they had a grill on the other side and she didn't think that she could use that. You know they be spitting in my food, at least I got my drink without a spit in it. Way the go Taco Bell/KFC. Keep disappointing the public and u be the next company going bankrupt. Will call corporate for sure about this. Also took them 9 minutes to serve my food in drive through, would like to get compensated for my gas!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would be saying this but this Taco Bell is amazing. The staff is friendly and funny, everything is so clean, and they are always stocked. Its a big change from the usual fast food service that I am use to. They even sing a little jingle ever now and then. This is the only taco Bell location I will ever go to."}
{"text":"The starburst frozen drink machine is often broken and that is not good for anyone. I think it purposely breaks down during happy hour and then suddenly gets fixed after 5pm. The Baja blast is not as good, but the spiked frozen lemonade is decent. The new naked chicken chips are spicy, but better than most other fast food nuggets. Soon. they will be gone too."}
{"text":"This is my go to snack spotwhen i'm shopping in the area. I have a soft spot for the really bad food at Taco Bell, i gotta say. When you need a quick, cheap snack, it's great to pop in. My fave is the $5 combo thingy. A pop, choice of fries or nachos and cheese, 2 tacos (I like one each hard & soft) and your choice of dessert apple pie or cinnamon twists. Filling!! I know it's not the best food, but it's yummy, and i don't get it very often ;)"}
{"text":"I've literally been standing at the counter for over five minutes without being helped lmao. I see 4 employees in the back but no one has asked me if I need help. One looked right at me and looked away and kept sweeping. There's not even any customers in the dinning area so I'm confused. Anyways I'm leaving will just go somewhere else :)"}
{"text":"Normally, I don't review chain restaurants, but due to the new release of Taco Bell's breakfast, I decided to break with tradition. First, I visited this location around 9am. The customer service was a little lacking...I had to repeat my order three times then was told they were out of eggs...Ugh!

I decided to wait for them to make some more (after all, how do you eat a breakfast burrito without eggs??) I was told 10 minutes, which turned out to be more like 30 minutes.  I got one of each of the new items (waffle taco, breakfast burrito, and a crunchwrap).

The waffle taco could have been better. I would recommend syrup with it (none provided). The waffle was greasy and soggy. I had high hopes, but they were dashed. Hopefully, they work out the kinks from this one.

The burrito was average. No salsa provided which would have gone a long way. I've had much better breakfast burritos. I would even say, I prefer Mc'Donald's to Taco Bell's.

The crunch wrap was my favorite. It had a thin layer of hash browns. I got it bacon and it was delicious. This saved my faith in Taco Bell. If you want to try something, this is the one to get.

Overall, it was a disappointing visit but the breakfast crunchwrap saved the day."}
{"text":"The drive thru was backed up so we decided to go in and order our food to go. I walk into no one at the counter and employees frantically trying to catch up. So I wait to be greeted for five minutes. Then my order takes 10 minutes to make. So slow service. I have gone here before and they are closed when they are open. I avoid this place but I needed to go for a client who really wanted Taco Bell. So bad."}
{"text":"The tables were dirty, and the food was cold. The shredded Chicken quesadilla was wet and cold.... The cheese wasn't melted. The Fritos beef burrito was the only redeeming part of the meal. My burrito Supreme was cold as well. I keep going back partly because this seems to be the only place with the diet Baja mountain dew drink. Anyway, I will probably go back again because I'm a sucker... I will just have to refuse cold food with shredded cheese that's not even melted."}
{"text":"The LONGEST Taco Bell drive thru line ever! If you don't have at least 20 mins to wait don't go!!! And make sure you have sauce...they ask you when you order if you want any...and then by the time you get to the window they forget!"}
{"text":"Why do we stop here and eat? It's cheap, It's fast, the name is familiar? Probably one or all those reasons. But we could be so much kinder to our digestive track if we would just explore out side the box! I once went 15 years without eating at a Taco Bell. Why did I try it again? Must have been an advertisement over powered me. I can be strong again and refuse to eat this crap once again or forever."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Taco Bell.  I know, 39% beef.  Regardless of my ability to eat faux beef, this location is operated very smoothly.  Their drive through for the most part runs like a well oiled machine.  Everyone that works there has always been very friendly. There is one guy that is actually on the verge of being annoyingly friendly!

I've waited longer being the only person on line at other places than I have being the 6th or 7th at this Bell.  They have quite a weekday lunch rush, especially on mondays (yes I go there that often).  But they handle it well and it is *extremely* rare to get your order wrong.

Though you might have to ask for a spork."}
{"text":"We were the fifth car in the drive-thru line.  It took 30 minutes for us to get our food.  It was unbelievable.  Even more frustrating is that once we got to the window, we sat there for 10 minutes while we watched them serve three inside guests.  I think this is because once you're in the drive-thru lane, there's no way out.  Since they know you can't leave, they don't give a shit how long it takes to get your food.

It literally became night while we were waiting for our food.  I will never go back to this Taco Bell again."}
{"text":"First this has to be one of the worst looking locations I've ever seen at a Taco Bell second how are you going to offer breakfast and say you're open for breakfast when I just went through the drive-thru and the restaurant and you are clearly closed which might be a blessing in disguise now that I read the reviews drove around the building and it looks like a scary place to eat. It's very apparent the manager doesn't know how to manage and the employees probably do not know how to show up to work since the restaurant is not open at the time they say they're open I think I'll pass and not ever eat at this location I will drive farther to a better location. Just looking at your location I'm surprised the you don't have health code violations and you're not shut down I would assume that you were but I also see that there is three cars in the parking lot that look like employee vehicles and yet not open..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff but the hash browns are not good every time I try and they have messed up my order a couple times."}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant at 9:50 p.m. As we got out of our car and started walking towards the door an employee looked through the glass door and locked it. The posted restaurant hours showed that the dining room should have been open until 10 p.m. We had to go through the drive-thru. (The receipt we received  for our food after we got back in the car and waited in the drive-thru was even time stamped 9:58.)When we asked to speak to a manager, the manager professed to have no knowledge about what his staff were doing or why his staff were locking the doors early. He did make the rediculous offer for us to get back out of the car and bring the food we just purchased via the drive-thru into the dining room and eat.  While the food tasted great, the attitude of the manager and the staff members left a sour taste in our mouths. If you don't feel welcome in a place, you don't want to go back there to eat no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"I drive through this morning to get a crunch wrap and the wrap came with an extra ingredient... PLASTIC... there was a long string of PLASTIC sitting in my crunch wrap!! Not only this but Laurie, the person serving me was rude as hell from the moment I pulled up to when she gave me my food!!!! I asked for the manager and she said I had to call back several hours later!!! Screw this place"}
{"text":"2018 Update: Skip the $1 Triple Melt Nachos. The only cheese you will end up tasting is that Nacho Cheese and they did not re- invent the wheel with this item. The quesarito remains on the menu and it is not bad, but you will pay later. 

The new everything is a buck menu was sampled this morning and had good results.

Grilled Potato Fiesta Burrito - no nacho cheese sauce. After excluding the cheese, you are left with just eggs, pico and potatoes (has brown patty crumbles) in a grilled burrito. It tasted good, eggs were cooked well and the grilling seals the burrito closed for a better eating experience. If you need something on the fly, try two of these..but hold the fake cheese."}
{"text":"My favorite Taco Bell, it's conveniently in my neighborhood and they always remember me and my order. I love how they usually hook me up with a free drink too! The best Taco Bell"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this Taco Bell negative stars if that was possible. Everyone knows Taco Bell serves shit food, but come on! Pretty sure my chalupa shouldn't be frozen."}
{"text":"I wish they didnt take olives out of their food.  Otherwise good quick fast food."}
{"text":"One star because Taco Bell serves generic and fairly bland food that makes my stomach hurt.  Add another 2 stars for this particular Taco Bell because it has fast and friendly customer service.  So thumbs up for this Taco Bell location and thumbs down for Taco Bell in general. 

Got dragged here by someone that wasn't willing to trust a local Vegas tacqueria.  She only wanted Taco Bell.  Meh.  Tried the nacho cheese taco they've been marketing.  It's bland and uninteresting.  Not sure how they managed to make nacho cheese Doritoes bland, but they did.  Eh.  I guess it could be worse."}
{"text":"Joshua F in the drive thru is amazing. He always has a positive attitude and made my night tonight. The freeze machine was down which was a bummer but he was great with customer service. Meal was made great (when it usually is made sloppy and thrown together). Thanks Joshua! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Watched the girl tonight at 12:55am sitting on her phone with the drive thru head set still on her head. Worst service i have ever received- If their kitchen really was closed... She could have at least said so. This is the second time this has happened now to me. I'm definitely don't with this location. Inconsiderate workers."}
{"text":"I don't normally rate fast food places, because really, aren't they all kinda the same.  But I was super impressed with them and feel they deserve a good word.  It is a hike if you're coming off the interstate (about 2 miles), but the location was new, fast, friendly, and damn near perfect.  It was also the freshest tasting Taco Bell food I've ever tasted, if that's possible.  If you have to do fast food, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell used to be pretty good, but their customer service has been in a steady decline and Taco Hell would be a more accurate business name. 

After not receiving part of my order, I called to inform that I wanted to come back later to get it. I also informed that when I was there it seemed very frenetic and hurried which was very unusual. It was then that I was told they lost their store manager, several associates and other various workers because of some 'controversy issue'. Sounds like they have some pretty serious issues, the first being competent help!

The manager I spoke to flat out said it would be several weeks before they got back up and running they way they should as they are trying to get people trained. 

Question - Why stay open? Why not close your doors for a week and get your shit together? Won't you do more damage to the business by serving only half our orders or making them incorrectly or even making us wait for an unreasonable amount of time to even give you our order in the first place?

Perhaps this summer they can work their way back to the friendly, fast service they used to have; although I'm not holding my breath. In the meantime, I suggest going to the store and getting items for homemade tacos."}
{"text":"Very polite, decent customer service. The rice in my burrito was hard and seemed very old."}
{"text":"OK, no joke- the Doritos Locos Taco Supreme is amazing!  I thought it would be gross, but after trying it- pure genius!

This Taco Bell is my go-to if i need my T-Bell fix.  I've never been inside, only through the drive-thru.  The people are always nice and fast.  Order is always correct.

I hope they keep the Doritos Locos Taco forever, and I'm not kidding!  If you haven't tried it- go now.  A Dorito as your taco shell?  Nice!

Everything always tastes good, as good can be from Taco Bell...haha!"}
{"text":"Get those Rolled tacos while they last folks. These are actually better than 90% of rolled tacos at normal drive through berto's kind of places. The tubes are quite long and filled with shredded white meat chicken and not greasy at all. You got five dipping sauces to choose, but only get one per order of two rolled tacos. The \"premium\" guacamole did taste and look a bit more normal than usual. It is 2 for $2 or 4 for $4, but they have some good box deal as well with a beverage. I did have a few beers pre-meal, but these would seem to work at most times as a good snack. The side of rice was a bad choice, but the $1 nachos hit the spot."}
{"text":"Stopped at this drive-thru after a late night flight and sat at the intercom for five minutes with no one there, pulled up to the window and still no one working! Mind you, it is 11:45 pm on a Friday night and their hours are open until 4 am! We were one of four cars utterly confused. Truly unbelievable. Where are their employees?!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to understand the sense of power and responsibility that must come with being entrusted with a squirt-gun full of sour cream, but apparently they don't give lessons on calibration.

Without fail, no matter what specific burrito I order, no matter how many times I say \"light sour cream\" or even \"NO sour cream\", there's inevitably one end of my burrito that is absolutely filled with the stuff.

I usually order twice as much as I actually want to eat, because I can reliably take a bite at one end or the other, determine which end doesn't have a mouthful of sour cream, and eat half of it. Then proceed to the next one, do the same, and toss the cream-soaked halves.

It's exhausting and wasteful but luckily one only gets a Taco Bell burrito craving every couple of months, when one's life is going on a spectacularly bad turn and you just want to eat the pain away."}
{"text":"They quality went down a couple years ago, but it seems to be really good now. Order is always accurate. Sometimes the portions are off, but it's not a big deal. The food also seems fresh. Before they used to serve dry beans. So they have impoved a lot. I take off 1 star because they got rid of the green onions on the Mexican pizzas and nachos. All Taco Bells did this 10 years ago, but I still miss it. Please bring back the green onions."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm giving 4 stars to a freaking Taco Bell. This Taco Bell is so nice and pretty that I feel the need to dress up a bit (wearing pajamas whilst going through the drive-thru here just seems too grungy). It's on the newer side. The staff are some of the best and most professional I've ever seen at a fast food joint. And the service is always friendly, quick, and accurate. So yeah, it kinda earns 4 stars."}
{"text":"A ok!! Its a baco tell. Seriously what else can i say?  The drive thru was clean. The location was hard to get in to. The menu didnt have the two buck firery quesidella i have only found in one other place."}
{"text":"We waited 24 years to finally get a local Taco Bell. What a huge disappointment! Since the restaurant has opened we've tried eating there on maybe 6 different occasions. Each time has been awful. I've reached out to both Taco Bell Corporate and Charters Food (franchiser) - don't feel like anyone really cared. At the end of the day, it's a training issue. There's no Kitchen, they don't cook, just heat stuff up and put it together according to a preset order.  And it's tacos! Pretty basic process.  I hope they get it together at some point."}
{"text":"This store fails EVERY TIME. OMG. I have a good sized family. 4 children 2 adults.... Never fails. Every time I get home, I'm missing a bunch of stuff. When you spend $25-$30 at Taco Bell, you expect to at least get what you paid for. Disappointing. I even tell them at the window to double check. It can't be that friggin hard."}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong order. Didn't find out till I got home but still I paid for more than what I got."}
{"text":"This is the best location in the world.. I call it Night Club Taco Bell.  Loud music, colorful lights, friendly people.. get your $4 on!"}
{"text":"Your friendly neighborhood Taco Bell. It's about what you'd expect. That is to say, it tastes like all other Taco Bells. If you have orders, they will get it wrong about 1 in 5 times. I used to live right by here, and it seemed like they could never anticipate how much Baja Blast they would sell because they'd be out about 10%+ of the time, which is a REAL bummer. They lose a star for that (on top of the star they lose for all the wrong orders). I rarely got stuck in the drive through here, but it happens occasionally. Mostly though, it's a shorter drive through, which ends up being to your advantage. I wouldn't bother going inside if you have the option."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell. There isn't really much to expect beyond being open late and serving tacos. This is far from the nicest TB in town. It's older, it's grungier, the drive-thru takes longer, etc. But they serve the same food as all other TBs. So yeah, it's a perfectly fine TB and will certainly satisfy your late night drunken cravings for some cheap tacos."}
{"text":"I typically get 5 hard tacos. They taste as they should, and they're not too stingy with the meat. Services are so so. The servers don't smile or anything, but I'm not really expecting too much. At least they're pretty quick.

Quality: 7/10. Services: 6/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 7/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"The sausage scrambler breakfast burrito is consistently delicious. Doesn't matter what state or what city. Always the same. Always delicious. Never had a personnel problem at any Taco Bell. Ate my first Taco Bell Taco in Anaheim CA in 1967. I think it was 19 cents. My most recent visit was today 2017. That's 50 years of Taco Bell. Must be the reason I don't need no Viagra."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  Every.single.time the order is wrong.  Ask for fresco style and specify exactly what that means to ensure the dairy allergic do not get sick and they are just plain rude about it.  The snarky girl in the drive thru tonight needs a lesson in customer service or a job where she has no interaction with people.  Mid request she cuts us off with \"yeah I know\". Look, people wouldn't have to reiterate their requests if your co workers did not mess up the order EVERY SINGLE TIME!  I worked in and managed restaurant for a good portion of my life and have a hard time with poor service and attitude when dining out.  It does not matter if it's in the drive thru at fast food or 5 star restaurant I expect to at least be treated respectfully.  I will not ever return to this Taco hell again.  I will gladly drive 10 miles out of my way to go to a different one.  I understand you don't make much working at a restaurant but take some pride in the work you do."}
{"text":"Horrible once again. Wouldnt do the 25% Off offered on the Ap this month because she said they were just sold. This is the 4th time ive tried to use something from the Ap and been unable to. Each time they call same lady manager, short, dark hair. She said this tome it was on a 25.00 or mire purchase. The cpn caps at 10.00 and thats all it says so again I received nothing for my 20.00 order when according to my Ap, i was eligible for something. Im iver going to taco bell now. Im deleting the ap and going back to del taco.   This location knows NOTHING about customer service. I waited a month to eat here after my last drama but the only thing they changed was the drive thru person. Shes a gem, keep her get rid of that nasty manager who tries NOT to even give you your free frozen drink which is on the ap this month. Never was able to get my free taco last time! Im over it."}
{"text":"About the same as other locations.   The food not very good.  Tacos and other items are real soggy.  You can do better at a Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"About the same as other locations.   The food not very good.  Tacos and other items are real soggy.  You can do better at a Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"I visit this Taco Bell a little more often than I should, because some days I just need a quick bite to get me through an evening of errands or to pick me up after a very long shift at work. The food they serve is fine enough - by Taco Bell standards, of course. There's certainly better places for tacos and whatnot in the area, but this Taco Bell makes pretty tasty fast food that hits the spot on a bad day.

But man, the service! Every time I come here the drive-thru is horridly backed up for one reason or another. Not only are the workers not prompt in taking orders (not once have I been able to place an order right away after pulling up to the station to do so), said orders are never ready when people make it to the window. I honestly don't think they've ever had enough people on staff during my visits to handle orders from the drive-thru AND indoors. The result is delay after delay, and my \"fast food\" order here has never gotten to me under 15 minutes. And because of the design of the drive-thru you can't even leave to go to Wendy's when you're ready to give up. You're trapped and forced to sit. And wait. And wait...

I think whoever is managing the place really needs to re-evaluate the busy hours here and adjust staffing accordingly. It shouldn't take 15 - 20 minutes to get a cheap taco from a Taco Bell. Definitely skip this place if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Had to call the police to get a refund for my food we waited 15 minutes the food did not come. I asked for a refund they reefused so I had to call the police when the police got there they gave me my refund I have never had to call the police on any kind of establishment before.NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"We ordered food from the drive thru and when we got our food, an entire combo order was missing. First, when we told the woman it was missing, she basically did not care or even apologize. Second, it was such an inconvenience having to go back and wait for our full order so we politely asked when we finally got the right order if there was ANY possible way we could have some form of compensation for our trouble..like simply just an extra taco or some cinnamon twists or maybe just an APOLOGY. The entire staff ignored us, stared at us from behind the counter and when we finally left, that's when they said sorry right before laughing from a distance. In general, this Taco Bell has some pretty inconsiderate customer service."}
{"text":"When it comes to Americanized Mexican food, Taco Bell fits the bill. Fast, basic and according to our kiddos, satisfying. We ordered 2 Nacho Tacos and the 3 tacos with drink deal. A snack under $10. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Doritos Lovers Alert! The Doritos Loco Tacos come with 3 different shell flavors: Nacho, Cool Ranch and Fiery Fiesta. Taco Bell delivers their seasoned meat, lettuce and shredded cheese in these Doritos shells and regular crunchy taco shells. We got the 12 taco deal plus 2 Doritos Locos for $18. The lettuce smells like it comes from a bag."}
{"text":"Sooo....it's not good.  Been here a few times, it's never been good.  But today, I ordered a blue raspberry freeze.  I got TWO cotton candy freezes instead. Informed them of their mistake, got a blue raspberry one with a lid that wasn't on all the way so it spilled all over my car.  They gave me another one with a lid that was on all the way (yay for me).  All of this is on top of repeating myself 3 times when ordering and them still having the order wrong when I got to the window.  I only ask the bare minimum and they couldn't deliver that."}
{"text":"Typical Taco Bell. I do always receive very friendly service at this location as opposed to some others."}
{"text":"I wasn't too hungry went I drove up but I sure was by the time I got my food. They are super nice but the food takes a while."}
{"text":"This location needs a little help with tidiness and customer service. Twice I've been here and ice tea is has been empty. The food doesn't taste as good as others locations. Not sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Had to repeat our order 3 times, then got asked again what it was. Still came out wrong."}
{"text":"Aaah, Taco Bell. If my boys could eat here every day, they would. 

I've never actually stepped foot inside of this location. I always go through the drive through, the only downside is that they have a really long wait time, the drive thru is always busy, that's why I can't give them 5 stars. Average wait time is about 10 minutes but on other occasions I have waited up to 20. 

The employees have always been very nice and friendly. I always get the correct order, which is great, no ones likes driving back because of an incorrect order, now, I don't want to jinx myself (knock on wood)."}
{"text":"This is a Taco Bell. I will not talk much about the food, because it is a Taco Bell. You know what you can expect. 

What I -will- say is I have never had anything screwed up here. I've been to Taco Bells where ordering a 7-layer burrito (one of my favorite items) means you get something that tastes entirely of guacamole, because they put twice as much of it in as they should. I've never encountered that here; everything is balanced correctly, and whatever menu item you order will come to you exactly as it should.

So with that out of the way (and it hopefully being clear that this rating is not about the food itself; don't expect fine mexican dining because it's a 5-star, it's still a Taco Bell), on to why this review:

What sets this Taco Bell apart from others (besides, obviously, the 'making the food right') is the service. As other people have indicated, it is good. Very good. The people are friendly. Almost too friendly; it can feel a little cloying sometimes. But that's still far, far better than the alternative, and even when I find it a tad irritating, I still leave with a smile on my face after having dealt with the people here. They're doing something right when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"The night shift manager no good. Has attitude. Really bad attitude. On the speaker you literally have to tell HER 17 times what you wanna eat, she doesn't get it.  I called police on her 2 times. I mean all i want is some food i have no clue what her problem is."}
{"text":"Slowest, most unmotivated crew in the history of Taco bells.    They clearly hate their jobs and are totally indifferent to the customers.   The drive thru line was obscene and the people inside had to suffer through the idiocracy of fowl mouth idiots spouting nonsense within the earshot of 5 year old kids playing the most annoying sounding games with bells and whistles at full volume.   Everyone's order was late.  20 minutes later we got ours. 25 minutes later we discovered they got our order wrong.   Which means so did someone else.   This place needs some work to say the least."}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bells go, this one is my favorite. It is a newer location and the staff seems well-trained. They have always been able to handle my order and I am very picky. A little better than your typical fast food experience and a convenient location."}
{"text":"To use the word aggravated is an understatement. I drove to the Taco Bell on Sharon Amity... Closed! So I drive to the this Taco Bell, and guess what? Closed!!! Change the hours or stay open for your customers."}
{"text":"Drove there at 2:30 am and the lady said they were closed. I'm wondering if the people that cut her check know it's being closed 1.5 hours early. Honestly there is no excuse for that."}
{"text":"My default late night dinner spot! I don't know why but it's freaking good! No problems ever. You know how some places are stingy with their sauce packets? Yeah, not here my friend! they hook you up! Default order: Beefy 5-layer burrito, Nachos, and Baja Blast! Think outside the bun.

New sauces: Fire roasted and Verde! Awesome flavor!"}
{"text":"My experience at Taco Bell tonight was absolutely horrible. The man working at the drive-thru made me stop my car just before the sensors,&made me sit there for a good 10minutes. He decided to take multiple orders from others in the drive-thru before me, as I saw him from the window. However, my main complaint was about the mexican pizza that I received. The first bite I took, I spit out right away. The meat tasted like cardboard and looked very old. It seemed the mexican pizza was made 3 days ago, heated up, and served to me. Im very unhappy with the service as well as the food tonight. I would like to request my money back."}
{"text":"BEWARE IF PAYING WITH CASH!! The girls at the drive through have a scam where they short you on your change and it is a very consistent scam, and its a grand scale. The first time it happened was about 2 weeks ago and i paid with a $20 bill and got my change and put it in my pocket and drove away and stoped at circle k, where i realized i was only given $6 back and not $16, they kept $10. So i called when i got home and spoke to a male manager that said that drawer was recently counted out and there was no extra money in it and he told me that since i left he couldnt do anything about it. So since then i have only paid with my card, until today being close to my pay peroid i had to pay with my cash but i was going to watch this time, and sure enough a different girl at the window tried the exact same scam only this time the female manager behind her was in on it, so i refused to leave the drive through until i got my $10, the entire time i never put the $6 that they gave me inside my car and i held it towards the drivethru window with the reciept that shows i gave them $20 and some change, after a lot of laughing they finally gave me my $10 with no apologies or anything.. i wont be back and i am going to make sure corporate knows about this store repeatedly scamming customers.."}
{"text":"Came here for pizza hut pizza. This taco bell doesn't not sell pizza. Some-how due to not being able to use the bathroom, I decide to order some fast food. I order the nachos grande or whatever you call it. Boy I haven't being here in years and I guessed it showed. These nachos only had cheese, sour cream, chicken, and beans. So I had to add extra toppings. Yelp 20 mins later- taco bell did it's job-I am now sitting on the toilet  writing this review and boy I am happy that I am to use the restroom."}
{"text":"me and my boyfriend used to go here alot for lunch since its the closest to work. we did the drive-tru and the meal i wanted to get had the price messed up. it had the combo price for the quesadilla and the price for the quesadilla for the combo. so the combo was cheaper. i ordered the combo anyways and when she gave me the total at the window i told her that the price they had displayed was less than what she was telling me. she didnt believe me. i asked her to go check, she said \"no, i dont have time to go check are you gunna pay or not?\". we were the only ones in the drive tru! i told her never mind i'll take my buisness somewhere else. i wouldnt have had a problem paying for it but she could of at least checked and fixed it. we went again recently after not going to that taco bell for awhile. we went inside instead and ordered to go. it took forever! and they werent even busy!"}
{"text":"Not trying to bash but late night here is 30 minutes to an hour wait in the drive thru. I've had plenty of mess ups here late night as well. Breakfast however they seem to be able to do pretty well and in a timely manner no less. The people are usually pretty nice here as well so that helps. I just try not to come here after 3 pm unless you're prepared to wait wait wait wait. That's really the biggest issue."}
{"text":"How do you review Taco Bell? They are all pretty much the same. I come here for lunch sometimes and it's ok. The location is in a high traffic area. The thing that bugs me is they serve ice tea, but no lemons just limes...really just limes?"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is terrible. The food is the same as any other Taco Bell, but the service here is downright sad. They have messed up my order 3 times in a row. I hate sour cream and always ask for no sour cream and every time I always get sour cream. This place sucks at life, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really terrible place to eat, so far I had 2 problems with their food but the second one was last Friday. I bought 2 chicken chalupas for dinner, next day I was sick. Vomited Saturday at work and I had to go home early  and Sunday I didn't work. End of story I lost 2 days of work and I had to go to the Dr. he told me I had food poisoning and I know it's because that food from Taco Bell.   Stay away from them."}
{"text":"I am now changing my three star rating to a 5 star! This Taco Bell is by far the best!!! Every time we go here the order is always perfect.. Extra cheese.. No this.. Add that... It is always right!! The staff is so friendly and don't make you feel like another customer just in the drive through Alexis is my favorite there. She is friendly with my daughter and also let's her pay through the window so it makes her feel like a big girl! This Taco Bell is worth the drive if it's not the closest one to you. I have 6 other taco bells we could go too, and this is the only location I will go too!  Thank you for a making the family happy!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Never thought I would write a review on a fast food place, but I really like the customer service at this Taco Bell. I had Chris as our server on 8/17/16 and we went in around 10:15. I got the shredded chicken burrito, cheesy gordita crunch, and my husband got the smothered burrito and fiery gordita crunch and smothered burrito. All the food was what we ordered, was delicious, but what sold us today was the customer service. Chris was very friendly over the speaker and was patient and polite with us as well. Ive had ok service at fast food places but he was so nice and welcoming, I had to write a review. We will be going to this location from now on. Its nice to see people who actually are friendly when they are working with people because I know you probably come across some horrible customers. Thanks Chris :)"}
{"text":"Waited in line no one els there while the talked inside horible service.. My order wasn't correct I didn't get asked if I'd like any sauces no napkins must my things were thrown in the bag I waited 26 minutes for my water the outside and inside the building are filthy and please don't seem to care anymore management has a real challenge on their hands they need to get in the building and get it taken care of and get everything in order because the employees are not with the need to take that place back"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. You get what you expect from here. The place is looking nice now that they demolished the old building and built this new one. 

Nothing special to say about Taco Bell. Quick fast tacos and nothing special."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to run for the border. Sometimes you just want Taco Bell tacos. Went today and despite all the negative reviews found my tacos to be exactly what I expected. As far as Taco Bell goes and my experience today this Taco Bell is just as good as any others. 

I ordered four tacos. I got four tacos. I ordered a mt dew and guess what?  I got a Mountain Dew. 

Added bonus:  the taco meat was nice and hot!

I don't know what people expect from Taco Bell but this is far from \"the worst Taco Bell ever\". That designation belongs to the one in gila bend."}
{"text":"I was given a spork with my Nacho Bellegrande without asking. This is one of the better Taco Bell's."}
{"text":"This is the worst taco bell in Vegas they mess up every order they have they don't make the food right and the service is indeed horrible !"}
{"text":"Garbage. Hair in the food. Always getting the wrong order. Food is slopped together. I drive 10 minutes outta my way to go to the other Taco Bell. Stay away."}
{"text":"good food but cold food.  don't order online. I live right around the corner and it took me maybe 3 minutes to get there, but then i had to wait in line behind every Tom Dick and Harry who hadn't ordered and it's like what in the hell is the purpose?"}
{"text":"Really wish I could give this t-bell zero stars. So terrible. I hate being the guy who comes \"last minute\" but this time I came an hour before close which is still cutting it close I guess but their grill was off so we couldn't even get what we wanted then we checked our order and we were missing two things and we pulled around and they apologized before we even said anything. It was awful and they suck. AVOID THIS T-BELL IF YOU CAN! Then we pulled around again because we were still missing one of the two items and the lady was very rude. I've been to the Taco Bell 3 times but I've gone through the drive threw 7 times...weird!"}
{"text":"Almost guaranteed to mess up your drive through order.   It's almost like a joke.  What did they screw up or forget now?!  Forgotten chips, forgotten items.... Just when you think you can't mess up 4 items.  BAM! They didn't make it supreme.  Gave up going back there to fix it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been go to this location for a long time. Very frustrated that the Freeze machine is always broken. It's been broken over a week now. They should at least post a sign saying it doesn't work. As the guy at the drive thru and he said they need to order a new machine and it will be awhile. Sounds like a poorly run store."}
{"text":"If you complain about Taco Bell, especially a 24/7 Taco Bell..you're a loser and need to go cook your own food. Thank you Taco Bell for being open 24/7 in a land where there hardly any 24/7 joints"}
{"text":"Can I leave zero stars? Waited for over TWENTY minutes for \"fast\" food. Then when I failed to get my food.. I ask for a refund. Which takes them at a least a good five minutes to process. Then.... they can't find the \"reprint\" button to give me a copy of my receipt. 

Waste of time. Incompetent and understaffed."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell by far. Have completely screwed up my order twice now. I thought the first time was a fluke but the second time they completely shorted me a taco and then argued with me about it. I don't know what kind of sub humans they employ at this location but if it's any indication of what kind of creatures inhabit Cuyahoga Falls. I really hope they all get sterilized so they can't reproduce and further infect the population. It's 2018 and I will be calling the corporate number, do not get me wrong but if you have a late night, or hell a 1030 pm craving for tacos. Do yourself the favor and drive to the state road location. The employees are friendly and don't appear to live in a halfway house. Plus they never screw your order up."}
{"text":"Once again...total failure...no meat in one of our tacos AND they forgot to give me my small pop...Done with this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"You can't expect much... Its taco bell. I am happy its open till 3am... It seems to taste better at that time of the night."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Taco Bell but I do not care for this location. The service was very slow, the staff was rude and the food was made carelessly. My mom's food barely had any beef in it and my food was very skimpy on cheese. I don't think I will be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I understand that mistakes happen.  I ordered 2 Chicken Quesdillas without the green sauce that is put on it and wanted red sauce instead.  After I received my order and realized it had the green sauce on it the manager was more interested in telling me the sauce isn't green it's actually tan. They always get you in the drive through. Waste of $8. From looking at the other complaints on here it doesn't appear the ownership or the management even care."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell service in America. I suggest going to a different Taco Bell. It's too bad this place is convenient."}
{"text":"This is a poor excuse for anything resembling fast food. If you're gonna eat here, bring a book or something to keep yourself entertained."}
{"text":"I go to this one the most.. 
overall I'll give it a 3/5. 
Fairly consistent when it comes to quality, they have the same crew regularly (like literally the same guy has been there the 3 years I've frequented) 
Will say the drive through layout isn't the greatest especially with a lunch rush it shares with the adjacent bank."}
{"text":"Its your typical taco bell ...but

If you use the drive thru expect a heavy unpleasant odor..and the few times i've gone..they've gotten my order wrong..or took forever"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could, it also seems to happen around this time at night. The girl at the drive through doesn't not know what she's doing and always messes up our order. We ask for no sour cream and it's everywhere on our nachos. The Mexican pizza was thrown in its container and wasn't even cut. They used to have such great worker there but it's gone way down hill. Such a shame"}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed by how much I love Taco Bell. I think I have a taste for crappy food. I can't explain any other way why I love chicken nuggets (breaded pieces of who knows what) and Taco Bell burritos (tortilla around some brown??). But when it's a late night and there's nothing open but your stomach is still grumbling, I just need something salty and satisfying. Yum! But make sure you don't eat too much, it might become a problem for you and your loved ones later on."}
{"text":"Taco bell is not the best Mexican food. If you need something fast and cheap tho, its  gonna get the job done. I wish they had more authentic little taco stands everywhere, but till they do Taco Bell is my Spot. You can get guacamole for 50cents."}
{"text":"I love me some Taco Bell... But this place is one that stands out. I don't know if it's just good management or ownership but this is one of the friendliest and most efficient Taco Bell's, scratch that... Fast food restaurants, that I've ever been to. They are noticeably more friendly, it's like I'm going to a Chick-fil-A :-)

I just wanted to give you kudos to the staff at this Taco Bell. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Horrible location !! got food poisoning as well !!!! food tasted terrible !!! robertos and del taCO MUCH BETTER !!!!"}
{"text":"y'all get it together. this drive is always incredibly long and the employees don't ever seem to be concerned about getting the line down. Also, having the drive thru blocked by plants and such is incredibly annoying. Also they're always out of something."}
{"text":"Ordered my food in the drive thru came home to a unpleasant stale cold gordita crunch tacos and possibly kangaroo meat.. such a disappointment this location Taco Bell needs good quality food."}
{"text":"Let me now tell you the story of Taco Bell on Noblestown Road, kids.

First off, it's Taco Bell, so it can't get anything higher than three stars if we're being honest. The last time Taco Bell wowed me was probably before there was a Taco Bell in most every town. When I was a kid and we went to visit my grandparents in Florida, they had one down there and it was a real treat to go. This was back in the '70s, mind you.

So that being said, I miss classic menu items like the Bell Beefer, the Taco Light, and the CInnamon Crispas. Taco Bell, don't you know you have plenty of middle-aged fans out here who would gladly plunk down petty cash just to have these retro delights once again? Isn't nostalgia all the rage these days? For every breakfast waffle and quesarito you guys have spent months on in test kitchens, you could easily just bring back some old faves.

But I digress. This particular Taco Bell is so hit and miss on service it would be laughable were it not so sad. The last couple of times I went through the drive-thru there, it literally took the car in front of my 15 minutes each time to get its order and drive away. Who knows why it happened the first time. The second time, however, it all came down to a bunch of goofballs working the kitchen,

You see, I had ordered the new quesarito Big Box as well as another combo meal on the menu and a couple apple empanadas. I noticed that before the guy at the window gave me my food, he double, nay, triple checked the order before handing it to me. So He hands me my bag o' food and I head out only to discover that - surprise -  the main component of the quesarito big box was missing.

I shook my fist and cursed the night air as I turned around and headed back. I went inside with my receipt. A guy who wasn't cooking and wasn't working the window came up and I told him what my problem was. He apologized and told the cooks that he needed a beef quesarito (man I'm already sick of typing that word). A little time passes, and then the cooks both ask what kind of quesarito to make...and then they do it again about ten seconds after that.

In the meantime, the drive-through guy is checking other orders. He finds something wrong with one of them and tells the cooks. They bicker with him and insist they got the order right. Some more bickering ensues and the cooks then agree that the order was wrong. Some more time passes.

They get that order done and then ask once again what kind of quesarito I wanted.

Beef. Always beef. It hasn't changed since you asked twice five minutes ago. Guh.

So I finally get the quesarito and head home. I have no idea what's going on there with that particular crew, but suffice it to say that more training couldn't hurt. There's definitely a communication breakdown (it's always the same) going on there. 

May I never type \"quesarito\" again."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. However I am still spending hard earned money. I often go in and order a bean burro with sour cream. And nachos. Literally every single time they leave out the onions. Really?? It's like a super special order or something and the idiots lose their minds!! It's not brain surgery people ! It's a fricken bean burro with sour cream! For cripes sake!"}
{"text":"quality is slipping here....slower service....food freshness issues."}
{"text":"Look, it's Taco Bell it's good for what is......this particular Bell is very good. The girls and guys are always pleasant and helpful. Plus, bonus, they listen !#!!! Special orders come out correctly. ..shock....anyway give them a try. You can't beat the cheap eats and helpful staff."}
{"text":"The food and speed of service are always great.

I regularly run the train on the coin game at the counter. If free cinatwists and tacos were currency, I'd be Donald Fucking Trump #MakeAmericaNateAgain"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Takes the longest to get your food at this location. Then today they are out of chicken!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Taco Bell location, but ever since they remodeled, the service has not been as good and the food seems to be hit or miss. I got the new double chalupa with shredded chicken and the Nacho Cheese Cheesy Gordita Crunch with shredded chicken. Both of my items were made pretty good but my mom's Crunchwrap Supreme had barely any beef in it even though she ordered double meat. Also, the girl who took our orders was not very friendly. I will continue to go here when in the area but I will no longer be going out of my way to eat here until the service improves."}
{"text":"The worst drive through experience I have had in Madison so far!!! Omg...they made us stand in que for 15 mins before getting to pay. Once we did, we waited another 10 to get our food!!! Never ever coming through this drive through for sure........ if u are in a hurry... take my advice... never come here"}
{"text":"Wait is just ridiculous. Employees is saying that there are short handed. Waiting for 16 minutes so far."}
{"text":"I know it's New Years.... But this is ridiculous.  We came around 8:45 pm before closing.  We sat in the drive through forever before getting our order.  My boyfriend left and realized they short changed him by $10.   He drove away and had to come back for his money.  It took forever to get through the drive through so he walked to the window and had to ask for the money they short changed him.  We headed home... Then realized they shorted us in food as well. We got back to the drive through at 9:05.  They took the persons order in front of us and then left us waiting in the drive through saying \"hello?\" To the speaker.  Cars were also lined up behind us.  They didn't turn off the lights or anything to signal it was closing.  He drove up to the window and said \"hello?\" To the empty kitchen.  A girl popped her head out and said \"we're closed\" and walked out of sight.  He had to yell through the closed window they didn't give him his food.  She opened the window and gave us the missing food.

Seriously?  Short changed $10 AND food and wouldn't even help us get what we ordered and get our money back?

Horrible."}
{"text":"Definitely hard of hearing on the receiving end of the drive thru but I got what I ordered, after repeating a few times, convenient location for this home health worker  (where I go on my cheat days)"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell. 
This location is beautiful. The interior reminds me of a local cantina vs the generic fast food feeling. 

The food is consistent and the store is always clean. Even the art work is a little more hip that I'm used too. 

The only gripe I have is the hours.... 
9am to 10pm lobby. The drive through an extra hour.   I feel like Taco Bell is known for fourth meal, which is in the middle of the night. 

But I'm sure the staff doesn't mind not working overnight."}
{"text":"If they had a negative star that would be it. They messed up on my order and told me to get back in the line when the AMA was face to face with us. Have better customer service."}
{"text":"No one else in drive through but they wouldn't do separate orders because it takes too long. Really!?!?"}
{"text":"Hit this place after a night on the town. Reliving my youth! Did not end well. If it is only 35% beef what is the remaining 64%?"}
{"text":"Yuck!!!!!!!! First time coming here & I found a hair in my food!!!!! NASTYYYYYYY never coming here again!!!!"}
{"text":"It seems like every time I come here my order gets shorted!

Is this a way to make extra profits. It actually constitutes theft!  It's getting stupid.  Last visit missing nachos, straight cheese and a large drink!  How???

The staff would rather BS with each other then care if the customer is getting what they are paying for"}
{"text":"Won't be back.  Nobody in line in the drive thru.  Early morning and just wanted to grab something to quiet my tummy.  Ordered a quesarito and the guy upsold me on a steak one.  Fine.  Who doesn't love steak.  I drive away and get back into nightmare morning rush traffic only to find that it's ground beef not Stevan.  So he upsold me and I paid the extra 80 cents for nothing.  What a pain.  Of course I have to move on with my day of work.  Sometimes I think people do this stuff on purpose"}
{"text":"It's the kinda place where you're certain the employees don't spit in your food.

Best Taco Bell I've been to."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. Drive thru was busy and VERY slow. We waited for 15 mins and was assured all 6 items were in our bag. Go to drive out and of course we are missing one. No one would answer the door or phone so we waited another 15 mins in line. They weren't very apologetic or offered to really do anything for the inconvenience. Was told they can't answer the phone because it's in the back and it would slow the line. Just seems like they wasted more time by not answering and quickly getting what we were missing instead of pissing us off and stopping the whole line to figure out what the problem was."}
{"text":"SLOW! In the last month I have made the mistake of trying their drive through for lunch 3 times. All 3 times I it took more than ten minutes to get my food! The last time, today, it was almost 30 minutes!! I got up to the window and there was no one there, after waiting for another 30 seconds I drove off. Without even getting any lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!!!! Waited for 20 minutes for my food and got home and I'm missing my food.... Everyone else's food is there but mine is not.... Sucks really bad"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with a Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell. Staff was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. The Mexican pizzas are incredible as are the Doritos Los tacos. Try the Gordita crunch as well as the cheesy fiesta potatoes. Nachos Belgrade is legit as well. Love this location right on on the corner of jones / tropicana. Quick service and even better customer service. 2 thumbs up. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Had by far the worst experience at any Taco Bell that I've been to. It took 15 minutes to get through the drive through. My tacos were wet as if they had been sitting in a kitchen sink and my cinnamon twists were stale."}
{"text":"They have got to have the worst soda in town. Half the time it doesn't even taste like what you order. And what's with this drive through diet thing they are promoting? It will give you the runs so bad you will lose weight or what?"}
{"text":"It was 10pm...Order was all jacked up..even after saying it 5 times! ..When we realized something was left out..they asked us to come back around and go through the drive thru again!...Uuuuhhmm soooo why do I need to do that???...So my hubby parked the car and went in. 

I got home and the taco was soggy at the bottom. .taste like it was made hours ago!  And my drink was all seltzer water...OMGEEEE!  I so hate paying for something that's not right! ..we took the drink back and they gave me a large...whoopi!!!..won't be going back late night again."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell and am known for it (sadly). 

After recently becoming a Pescetarian, I have been able to keep my obsession going because they replace meat with beans in everything I want!

After going a whole 2 months with eating no meat (which I'm very proud of), taking a bite and realizing I had eaten some made me sick to my stomach. 

This upset me very much! Be a little more careful next time? Thanks."}
{"text":"Okay maybe out east our fake beef is tastier or something but this was hands down the worst Taco Bell I've ever had. 

First off, they messed up our order but being hungry and having a grumpy toddler yelling in our ears, we didn't bother to correct it. 

Second, the steak in the chalupas my husband ordered was extremely bland and the chalupa bread was bitter like it was old or fried in bad oil or whatever they do to that. The \"beef\" in my soft taco was the right color and consistency but was also flavorless. Stranger still was the normally soft tortilla wrap was crispy on the edges but soaked through everywhere else. How long had it been sitting there anyways? 

Hmmm, hoping that not ALL the Taco Bells in Arizona suck. But thankfully with all the Mexican food around, it shouldn't be hard to find decent tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered a Breakfast Egg Steak Quesadilla and bit into a Bone that was in the steak. Store manager just gave me a refund and asked for bone to report it to corporate. Nothing other than that. I contacted corporate and then got a call from the Assistant store manager who helped me out and was down to earth and had me fill out an incident report. Could've been real bad."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  I do not know why but apparently they do not know what chicken is.  Every time, same thing,  the past 5 years...I order the same thing - grilled stuffed burrito and ask for chicken.  Sure enough, it always comes with \"beef\" inside, and we all they aren't exactly serving grade A.  To top it off, some guy is standing on the counter as I wait for my order, as though that was the best time or means to do so?  He did however check on the quality of my meal, to which I nodded in approval.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"They gave me a brunt sandwich and 3 cups that were leaking. I am more then up with the state of my dinner"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell takes so long, it's not the best place to go for munchies because you'll be sober by the time you get your food. 

1:00 AM, only car in the drive through on a Wednesday night/ Thursday morning. 5 minutes to get our food. We didn't check it there (our bad) but we got home to find out we were given the wrong item despite having the order repeated back correctly. I'm not sure how this happened as there literally no one else in the drive thru and dining room closed. 

They do have a happy hour from 2pm-5pm with $1 loaded grillers and drinks, so I would be willing to deal with the wait for that deal, as long as my food was correct. 

The drive thru is a really tight turn in if you're coming from the right, it's almost easier to circle through the parking lot so you're turning left into the drive thru."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, and cheap.  Perfect stop for a mid-week lunch break, or a late night taco fix."}
{"text":"Sort of silly to review a fast food chain like Taco Bell but since receiving an incorrect order has happened to me so many times from here I think it bears mention. Getting home and finding the wrong or missing food just sucks. The people working here are exceptionally nice and if you do get a wrong order, they'll fix it quickly...sometimes hooking you up with extra food to compensate, maybe someone else's mixed order food haha. As far as the food quality goes, it's exactly what you would expect for Taco Bell or Pizza Hut. Love the combo. Hate that it's not open late."}
{"text":"My family eats at this Taco Bell more than I would like to admit. This store NEVER messes up our food. The employees are always very polite and go out of there way to make sure you have everything just the way you want/need it."}
{"text":"It's sad that I am even wasting my time writing about a fast food place but I am fed up with how many times they screw up my order. Almost 80% of the time they get the right order on the screen but then give me something else. Get your act together as I am sure I'm not the only person it happens to."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time . Place was not busy. Menu is confusing and should  be simplified.  We tried the hard tacis6 . It was flavorless.  I added the elevator Diablo sauce . This had kick . Probably more kick t g an most people  can handle . I tried their steak   quesadilla , it was OK.  Their salsa needed some kink . It was bland so I added the eldiablo  sauce.  Place appeared to be clean"}
{"text":"Can't get worse than this. Went inside to eat. Ordered a burrito supreme. Sat down with my husband opened my burrito and there was a long black hair wrapped up in the tortilla. Gross- got a refund nothing more offered for an apology. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Taco Bell must offer some of the cheapest calories in America. At this TB cheap calories come with great service.

Rare for an American fast food restaurant, I have never experienced a single episode of bad service at this TB. Whether it's the friendly girl who upgrades my nachos (gratis) to the next size or the incredibly animated man who also works the snack counter at the AZ Center AMC, this TB's employees have one thing in common: they aim to please.

The food, of course, is nothing exceptional. It's TB. It fills you up and, at this location, it has consistently filled me up without causing food poisoning. When you're talking TB, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Avoid this location of you are in a hurry. Takes forever to get items in a drive through. It took about 20 mins to get the food. Not at all prepared for the rushing crowd."}
{"text":"Clean on the inside. Staff is friendly. Food is always good here. Never crappy. Other than a few homeless people hanging out across boulder highway, I like this place."}
{"text":"Went for two potato grillers. Potatoes were VERY old and hard. One of the employees dropped a spatula on the floor. Did she replace it? No she wiped it with her hand and put it back on the grill. The manager saw that I noticed and removed it other wise I'm pretty sure she would've also kept it there too."}
{"text":"Asked for beans on my tacos and they gave me meat and also gave me a Pepsi instead of a baja blast. Dicks. I even tried to tip them too for being so nice lol"}
{"text":"We r regulars and usually dine in.  Again today I see the girl at the window blowing her nose then handle orders.  Last time the person took money with gloves on then proceeded to make our order and did not change gloves.  This staff needs a refresher on food handling!  Good was Luke warm again."}
{"text":"A little odd to get to your first time, but quite tasty and relatively speedy service.  I got addicted to the 5-layer burrito at this location.  Why is it so good?  Magic.  Taco Bell Voodoo Magic.   Mmm.

Good customer service, correct order comes out, and inside is very, very clean.  Taco Bell isn't gourmet by any means, but it will do in a pinch - especially for the price. Those $3 meals are perfect (I usually stash the chips at home for another time as the burrito + drink are fine by me)."}
{"text":"Fries were cold, they were out of soft taco shells and just about everything else on the menu including chalupas and i'm not even sure what else because the girl was rattling everything off so fast. Ordered two frito burritos one had no meat, one had no Fritos. They were less than half the size they normally are. Tried the nacho fries for the first time and they weren't even hot.... lousy experience"}
{"text":"Without fail this location gets my order wrong. Usually I'm missing a few items. Sometimes my Cheesy Gordita crunches are missing their taco shells. But usually I'm just missing several items. Everytime I think to myself there's no way they're going to mess up next time. There's no way a place can keep messing up orders over and over and over again. But every time I come through and have to listen to your weird employees using stupid Taco puns and not putting the right food items in my bag."}
{"text":"The food was typical Taco Bell, not great, but filling enough and hot.  It appears that they have raised their prices, and their drive through was slow as all get out, but the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Picking up some food for the office. This location is always quick and the food is great. I don't have any problems with the staff.  I've actually had suggestions made over the drive through intercom.  Very Friendly staff."}
{"text":"These guys did great for my family as going thru the drive thru.

Got our order correct, and they were fast, like fast food should be."}
{"text":"Went here this past Thursday evening for a quick dinner on my way to UNCC.  I usually don't take the time to review fast food restaurant unless the experience was really memorable - either for being really good or really bad.  In this case, my experience at the Davis Lake Taco Bell was memorable for all the right reasons.

Parking:  There is plenty of parking in the immediate area surrounding the building.  it is well lit and I felt comfortable being there by myself late on a Thursday evening.

Food:  I ordered the chicken grilled-stuff burritos and a pintos and cheese with a small drink.  My order arrived within 3 minutes and was made to my specifications.  The burrito was big and was filled to the brim with the standard cast of characters - refried beans, cheese, guac, sour cream, chicken, rice, etc.  The grilled stuffed burrito tasted awesome and the pintos and cheese were a perfect compliment.

Building/Facilities:  The interior of this Taco Bell was as nice of a TAco Bell as I am ever seen - really.  All the tables were clean.  The napkin and drink areas were both immaculate.  Event the chicken area in the back looked to be clean and well-kept. 

If you are looking for a clean, modern-looking, Taco Bell, were they get your order right and there isn't long lines day and night; then then the Taco Bell @ Davis Lake is the Border you should run to."}
{"text":"This is my local Taco bell, and my Taco Bell of choice.  If you've ever been to any of the thousands of Taco Bells around this great country, then you know the tasty, affordable dining experience you are sure to have each and every time you go to a Taco Bell, and this one is no different.  

When I go here, I usually keep it simple.  I prefer the XXL Grilled stuffed burrito - chicken or steak, it doesn't matter.  I ALWAYS STAY AWAY FROM THE GROUND BEEF!  You just don't know what you're getting with that stuff, and its really not worth putting your life on the line to find out.  Other menu highlights include, any of the soft tacos, nachos bell grande, seven-layer nachos, chick/steak burrito supreme, seven-layer crunch wrap supreme, and the pintos and cheese.  Of course there are many other items on the menu from crunch-wraps to cinnamon twists, but the best part of taco bell is that this great variety of menu options is offered from 2 in the afternoon to 2 in the morning!

So if you want good, cheap, filling, food, you know what to do - RUN FOR THE BORDER!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in the drive thru currently and the girl can't seem to figure out how to do a chicken burrito with grilled chicken instead of shredded. I ask for soft chicken with tacos with grilled chick and she informs me that they can't do grilled chicken. Since I order it at other Taco Bell's weekly I'm totally confused as to why I can't order what I want without her charging me 2.00 more when every other Taco Bell can do it and I don't have to ask about an additional charge. I'm only asking from r grilled and not shredded. Now I'm sitting in a drive through because I'm stuck here and I'm not getting any food because your employee doesn't know her job and apparently nobody else there does either. 3/1/18 at 12:53 pm."}
{"text":"I was there on weds and the woman taking orders through the drive thru was incredible, polite , so much so that I thanked her for being extra polite, my 7 year old son said \" her momma raised her right mom\". She was the best"}
{"text":"My quesadilla was BURNT and my taco was WET. How does that even happen? It's Taco Bell, there's not even any cooking involved. I shouldn't have had very high expectations for fast food but that's ridiculous."}
{"text":"I went to Taco Bell for lunch today to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr Day. Dude, they gave me my nachos without any cheese! How do you forget the cheese on nachos? One star for breaking my heart."}
{"text":"I personally love this Taco Bell. It's right outside of my work so can get a quick meal whenever I have a break and just relax in their nice old school dinning room. I may even go a little too often as the counter people are starting to recognize me lol. I was going to give this three stars until I found out they serve breakfast now too! It's doesn't start until 8am for all you extra early people, but Taco Bell didn't open until 10am before this, so it's still an upgrade. Great location too in a nice sizeable shopping center with lots of other food and retail options!"}
{"text":"This is a great, quality Taco Bell recently built with fast service and consistant food. I love Taco Bell because it's cheap and yummy!"}
{"text":"How the hell can Taco Bell be closed before midnight it should be illegal I mean it's practically part of a sobriety test"}
{"text":"Great as always meets expectations. Happy they have such vegetarian options.  Diablo sauce and spicy fritos. I'd make a documentary on eating here for a month if i knew I'd get mad money and infamy."}
{"text":"As of today's date, they DESPERATELY need a new speaker box!  It's the ones you see in the comedies that cuts out half of your order.  For people like my fiancé and myself who order custom food, that SUCKS.

This location was initially better a couple years ago, but it has been going downhill.  Not really sure what happened.  =T

The boo has given up on ordering quesadillas at this location.  =(  Every time they are bad.  It's either they add the sauce (he asks for no sauce), they overcook them (wtf?), they don't add enough cheese (mmm dry tortilla...), or - most recently - they add a RIDICULOUS amount of onion.  This is new.  They never had onion in their quesadillas before.  He gave it to me upon that discovery and I, the Onion Queen, deemed it too onion-y.  Yikes.  (For reference I enjoy eating onions raw as well as every other way you can eat them.)

Service is slow even when no one's in line.  Overall food quality is still good for Taco Bell, but I really wish they'd add Diet Mountain Dew to their fountain.  ARG."}
{"text":"I been to this TB a few times during lunch hour. Its a ghetto TB cause its alway filled with tweakers or homeless trying to scam a drink or a dollar. But they are fast and I don't eat there. 
So tonight I get off work a 11pm and I go to the drive though. No response. Car ahead got food. So I go to the window and the guy looks at me and then makes a driving motion. Really? Im not going back around. 
Didnt eat there much so no lost to me. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"This is a brand new Taco Bell. Newly built and opened about 6-8 months ago. It's one of the WORST locations I've been to.  My expectations aren't very high - it's Taco Bell!  However this Taco Bell has frustrated me enough to write this review.  The PROBLEMS:  Horribly managed.  Young kids don't seem trained and have direction.  No team spirit or desire to make guests happy like you see at other good fast food chains.  Have been through the drive through here and line is always long and slow.  5 out 7 times our order was wrong.  The Baja blast freeze machine is ALWAYS broken but this is true at most Taco Bell locations.  Tonight was last straw.  Went thru drive thru with 8 cars before me.  Finally order (1) Large Baja Blast Freeze only.   They say it's working and take my order.  I wait 14 minutes in line to get my drink - oh of course!  The machine is now broken and I waited for nothing.  NO Apology or offer to get me another drink.  All they say is machine is broken and they can't help me.   Perfect example of staff being taught NO customer service.  I would AVOID THIS LOCATION.  It's not worth it - I promise."}
{"text":"Horrible, how in the world do you get soggy tacos at 8 in the morning.  Well you go here where you will be served greasy tacos soggy taco shells and limp lettuce.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Have to agree with Kristen Bell.  This is the worst service ever.  20 minutes in a drive thru.  Terribly slow.  Flat out the worst I've ever been in.  People gave up and pulled out out of line which only confused them more.  Worst ever.  I want to build a wall around the taco bell.  Bigly."}
{"text":"I can see the place from work and that's about all the good things I can say about it.  Silly me I thought every place with lights on would at least serve some kind of coffee.  \"We don't have that.\"  So I pulled out of the drive through line and went on to work."}
{"text":"So...the guy and I were craving taco bell (and we weren't drunk) on behalf of all of the commercials during the football games featuring the volcano box and the fact that you can win a gold PlayStation or whatever the name brand of it was. That was a huge motivating factor for him...good work on the marketing, TB. So, I had chili planned for dinner and we stayed craving Taco Bell all the way until the next day at dinner where we shamelessly satisfied that burden of an urge we had been carrying for a solid 24 hours. 

Anyway, we ordered our food and ate it and were happy ever after, and I'm now writing a review on Yelp about Taco Bell. I know what you're thinking: I lead an interesting life. 

He didn't win the PS. Go figure.

Captin crunch bites are the shit, btw."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely APPALLED at this Taco Bell! I used to actually frequent it rather often, but went on a bit of a fast food hiatus. I had a craving for Taco Bell and thought, \"why not?\"

Oh, I found out \"why not\" in short order! First- the wait at the drive through was kind of ridiculous. Not just sitting in the line of cars, but once I'd placed my order, I sat at the window for quite awhile waiting for the food to be ready. When you're hungry and in a hurry, that's not the best thing. It is called \"fast food\" for a reason, right? Apparently not here.

Ok, food obtained. I get home, get settled, and go to open the mini chicken quesadilla. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? First of all, the cheese is so melted that I can barely unrwrap the aluminum foil. Once I do get it open...my stomach lurched. The pile of BURNED, gooey, mess that is in the foil is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that anyone thought it was a good idea to pass this off as food and serve it to anyone. I took (and posted) a picture, but it went straight into the garbage.

The chalupa was luckily in good shape, and the only reason this wouldn't get a ZERO star review. (other than the fact that we can't award zero stars here).  Obviously, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered a Stuft Steak Burrito from this location and it was decent and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"So this Taco Bell forgot to put my. Conchwrap supreme in my bag. I come the next day to get more food and my wrap only to tell me no not with out a receipt and very rude about it I know after this trip I'll never eat here again worst customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here as I was tired of casino/hotel food and I needed my Mountain Dew Baja Blast fix.

It wasn't busy and both the dining area and restroom were clean.

I enjoyed my nachos.

Service was quick and the cashier was friendly.

I'd drop by again if in the area.

Thanks Taco Bell for filling me up for the road trip back to California."}
{"text":"Worst service takes for ever one time i decided to time it 9 mins to get my food with 5 cars infront of me there are times one car in front of me and it will take over 5 mins plus its the only taco bell where they ask you how many sauces u want like seriously smfh"}
{"text":"Guy at the window was nice, food sucks.... goes to show you that a $10.00 per hour minimum wage doesn't increase quality!! Just the opposite!! Goodbye taco hell !! Hello BACKYARD TACO"}
{"text":"Look, I get it.  It's Taco Bell.  Expectations are generally low.

But oh my goodness.  I just spent 25 minutes trapped in their drive thru lane, unable to move.  Turns out they kept messing up the order of the poor woman in front of us.  3 times, incorrect.  How is that even possible?

We are all trapped behind her.  They won't move her to a park lane like other restaurants do.  Just simply unable to move.  Is that even legal?

I finally had to get out of my car and walk up to the window.  I told them they can't just trap people in the lane.  There's got to be a way to open things up.  I just wanted to leave at that point.

Thank heavens you don't pay until you get your food!  I finally was able to drive through.  Didn't even bother with the food.  I didn't feel like finding out how many times they would screw up my order.

I realize few people if any will check the reviews for Taco Bell, but if you are by some strange coincidence reading this, don't go here."}
{"text":"It's lunch at Taco Bell.

Smiling faces, a pleasant person to take my order.

Food delivered fast

Clean.

Food was normal Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This is a standard Taco Bell however I have noticed their switch to extremely fine shredded cheese in their tacos and other items. They seem to be of normal speed for a Taco Bell. I am sometimes disappointed in the inconsistent quality of the chips shells."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible, lady yelled at coworker right in front of me! Rude!!! Did not take me serious as I am Russian. With a very thick accent, i was very offended, never shall I ever return... unless my drunk self brings me back. Like back to the future"}
{"text":"Hands down worst Taco Bell ever.  Two other people ordering and it took 25 minutes.   And then the food was cold!!!  Save your self some frustration and keep driving."}
{"text":"Great Taco Bell location overall. Typical Taco Bell food you would expect, always hot and delicious. It's the staff that makes this location though. I'm lucky to live within walking distance, but I would go out of my way to come here if I was heading for the Bell. They were out of a flavor of one of the Limeade Sparklers, and the employee was kind enough to upgrade my size for free as an apology. Great service, employees are always fast and friendly and go out of their way to take care of you. What more can you ask for from a Taco Bell?!"}
{"text":"I'm a Taco Bell freak! This location is always REALLY fast, even with as busy as it usually is. I've never had one bad experience at this location in 8 years. Viva Taco Bell behind Target Greatland!"}
{"text":"I do love Taco Bell and this location is no exception. Usually a little bit slower than the others as it is still newer. Service is about as fast as the location behind Target Greatland on Buffalo."}
{"text":"You don't expect the highest quality food when you go to a Fast food restaurant. This is a one-star review because the employee helping us today rolled her eyes when we told her that one of our orders was wrong. She wasn't wearing a name tag so I can't call her out specifically but if you can't provide decent customer service (which at the bare minimum is at least not rolling your eyes) then you shouldn't work at a place where you interact with customers."}
{"text":"The others are correct. This is the worst Taco Bell or KFC I've ever been to. The stuff that they remembered in the order was not prepared correctly. The most basic thing at TB is a beef hardshell. There could not have been less beef or lettuce on the sad things.  I went inside to get the stuff they forgot in the drive thru and the kitchen was just disgusting. I was surprised to see they had a decent sanitation score, whatever that's worth.  Lastly, I was bummed that I couldn't slam them on their survey because they didn't put a receipt in the bag!"}
{"text":"I got a soda and a burrito supreme. The person who took my order and his manager were very nice, smiling and making me feel welcome. The ice was out at the inside machine, so the fellow filled my cup for me. 

The burrito supreme was a burrito mediocre. The insides looked pre-chewed and it was really greasy. I remember when you could differentiate the sour cream from the beans. Now its just a runny brown mess. Maybe that's just the quality now? I haven't had one in a long time. I remember lettuce, tomatoes, onions... Now I only saw soggy lettuce, and not a lot at that. 

Do you remember wayyyy back? Like 15 years ago... Maybe 20... The nacho bell grande had black olives, jalapenos, green onions in addition to everything else. It was piled high and it looked like people who made it took pride in what they did. Look at the nacho bell grande now. You get what I'm saying. 

I'll go back, but I won't get a burrito supreme again. Yuck."}
{"text":"This taco bell was renovated, nice inside and outside finally. The service is really good, I think it's a training store however. Not that that's a bad thing, but I always feel like the next person serving me is pretty new at this job. In their defense they get my order nice and hot, no complaints, just observations."}
{"text":"The drive threw lady asked me to check threw my back before I drove off to make sure everything was correct. I've never had someone working drive-through asked that question I think it's an important question to ask before the customer drives off and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Today's visit wasn't the best. The inconsistency on how the tacos were made was off. One taco had more meat and the others had too much lettuce."}
{"text":"I am so upset to come here and place such a large order late at night with no one really there so obviously it shouldn't be that hard to get the order right. 

It's another fast food spot that you don't expect customer service from but the least they could do is get the order right. I call to speak to a manager who Ofcourse doesn't speak English that well and if she does she sure didn't sound like it on the phone.  

As she sat there telling me what she did to our order I'm explaining to her that it's wrong with missing items she talks over me to correct me. I will never understand how such people are hired to run a store. I'll be calling again in the morning in hopes I talk to someone who understands customer issues."}
{"text":"Extra sauce apparently means=zero sauce. This is not the first time and I'm pretty p*ssed. Fix your employment or management. Went back again(only place open) they asked if I wanted hot sauce, etc.,...no sauce. Please at least TRAIN who you are paying please??"}
{"text":"I received a fourth of what I paid for so that was great! I loved being given less than what I asked for! After receiving my food I literally asked: \"is this everything?\" And the employee answered: \"yup\" and my LYFT driver took off. This was my experience at this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This location SUCKS!! We were the only people in line, yet we sat for 27 minutes waiting for our mini quesadilla's... 27 minutes?! Really?! Smh So, I figured that the food would be ok since it took them so long to make it... But, to my surprise there is hardly any chicken in these quesadilla's!! I'm so happy we ordered 6 of them instead of 4... We would still be hungry afterward if we hadn't... The 65% plain tortilla's will do nothing for a hungry person... Smh Also, it doesn't help that this place is really dirty... It's disgusting!! I will never be going back to this location... If I could give zero stars, I would!!"}
{"text":"I suppose this location isn't big on customer service. After reading all the reviews clearly management hasn't caught on to the things they should fix to ensure they stand out from the other fast food places around. They are pretty lucky they are the only taco bell in about a 5 mile radius.

I'm sitting here in drive thru line, got in like at approximately 12:21 its 12:42 and I am still in like to get my good with one car in front of me. Its a good thing I don't have a 30 minute lunch."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is literally the worst! I hate everything about it! The food is always pre made and soggy when you get it. We asked for some more sauce and they said no because they're running low... Wtf? So you have some but you paying customers can't have it because you suck at doing orders... Ok u right"}
{"text":"Although they are open from 7am-1am today, I couldn't order anything at 10:45am.  Was told to come back... \"I don't know, about 11-11:30.\"  Useless."}
{"text":"I stopped by this location after work because it's on my way may be about five minutes away from home and it took 20 minutes sitting in the drive-through to get my food when the dining room was completely empty there were six cars in front of me and when I got my food and pulled off to the side of the check it it was cold I will never come here again"}
{"text":"Service was super nice but slow. This location needs an update. Very old store & decor. Food is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the best taco bell i have ever had.
Very clean place and the staff is very friendly...... good folks here"}
{"text":"After months of inadequate staff who constantly messed up our order and took forever, something changed, and this Taco Bell has returned to what it had been.  Friendly staff, reliable service.  And that tasty Taco Bell quality I've come to enjoy when I'm good and hammered or just not in the mood to cook or drive very far."}
{"text":"They told me they didn't make the cheesy gordita crunch anymore...she couldn't tell me why..didn't even know if they still made the burrito supreme. Food was cold. I hate complaining but I've worked fast food before. It's not rocket science. Taco Bell still makes the cheesy gordita crunches. I won't be coming back here anymore since they don't know what they sell."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area so I've been eating at different fast food places (since I've been in the middle of bringing kitchen ware and such) and this Taco Bell location has actually had my orders correct like 3/4 times! The only thing they \"messed up\" was they added veggies to a taco when I didn't want them but they've been great for the most part so I give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Y'all, this t-bell is ahead of the pack; my chicken burritos (my go-to) were full. And my chief complaint at most t-bells is that they skimp dramatically on the chicken burrito. So I got what I wanted (and that's all that matters, right?!)."}
{"text":"Ordered some food and all the tacos were broken and the manager gave me a bad attitude about asking him to fix them"}
{"text":"A friend came over and decided to bring lunch with him. Five stars for his thoughtfulness.

He brought one of those box meals for me, why I do not know as it is too much food. All I can assume is he thought, well he is fat he can handle it. 

I suspect the taco was supposed to be spicy since it has a dull red color shell, not spicy. The burrito and crunch thing and taco all tasted the same, no difference at all. It tasted like mush, squishy soft horrible texture. I do eat at taco bell every now and again, but get the simple taco because it is usually full of lettuce and tomato with little beef. But this meal was incredibly awful. But hey the orange drink was good. I forgot about the cinnamon thingies, they gaged me. Who eats these things?"}
{"text":"The lady working the drive thru was friendly, however there was only one car in front of me, and it didn't look like they ordered $200 worth of food, but it took over 10 minutes when they pulled up to the window!! Of course my 3 soft tacos were ready and I was able to pay and leave, but the service is SO SLOW!!! And it seems like they close earlier than the times posted on the window some nights.  If you're craving Taco Bell, do yourself a favor and go to the one on Alma School & Warner!! The drive thru window is a little awkwardly set back, but they are quick and the food is always good and correct!!"}
{"text":"Not exactly quality food but sometimes hits the spot.  Most Taco Bells are pretty similar.  Similar mediocre food served by people who would rather work somewhere else.  This location is clean though and better then some."}
{"text":"Breakfast crunch wraps are the best. I always  get  the chicken quesadilla with extra jalapeño sauce. Never gotten and order wrong just a little cheap with the sauce. No complaints other than the 3 sauce packets for my family meal of 5. Food just doesn't taste the same with pace or other salsa at home."}
{"text":"I don't get how you can have a taco bell next to so many bars that closes so early.  This TB is on my way home from most bars but I rarely can eat here since it is closed.  Service is OK and I've even forgotten my credit card here before and got it back the next day.

Taco bell is best after a few drinks."}
{"text":"Just ordered 3 5.00 meals with 3 nacho fries  , shame on me. I drove away to find out no nacho fries. Had to drive all the way back to be told oh you forgot your nacho fries , WHAT!! No you never gave them to me !!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really quick and great service, thanks to associate Nathan! Thank you for being so friendly. I wasn't eating at the moment, but ordered food for two people in my car. They 'gobbled' it down quickly and I didn't hear any complaints or anything so I assume the food was good.

Nathan was very friendly. Smiled, was polite, respectful, the food came quickly. I let him know he was the nicest and most efficient taco bell employee I had ever encountered!"}
{"text":"Again, disappointed by a Taco Bell in the Charlotte area. Makes me wonder if the locations in South Carolina are a totally different restaurant under a different umbrella.

This location was slow. I thought and honestly expected them to be better than the location I normally visit, but they were just as slow. It wasn't crowded, so I wasn't understanding the lack of urgency. Understaffed perhaps? I'm not sure, but it took a good 10-15 minutes to get our food.

The taco supremes we ordered... were less than what we received at Taco Bell in South Carolina. The portion sizes were extremely small, taco shells did not crunch (meaning they were not very fresh).

We ate our food, and were somewhat satisfied, but also disappointed. We can't get over how much better how food was coming from Taco Bell's in South Carolina (more than one location - hence why it is plural).

Hopefully these locations in NC can make much needed changes soon."}
{"text":"There is very little more disappointing than ordering something and it doesn't come as expected. I ordered a nachos bell grande combo and asked for no beans on the nachos. It came without the beans but also came without tomatoes. Where were my tomatoes? Needless to say, I was unable to finish these delicious looking nachos because they were extremely salty. They were pretty disgusting this time around. It will probably be awhile before I return to Taco Bell.

I also ordered hard taco supremes, which were good. I just wish my nachos were made correctly."}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped here around 3:00 pm after a long day of working outside.  The woman working at that time was extremely nice and helped us save money by recommending different options.   I tried the quesadilla - it was very good.  My partner had several tacos.  My partner got horrible gas after the visit here.  I would probably go back, and definitely get the quesadilla again."}
{"text":"I will never go to this Taco Bell location ever again ! I did the drive thru and paid for my order and I asked if I can have sour cream, and the cashier  HUNTER S (  blond dude)  said it's 45cents and I said oh sorry I don't have it , I paid with my debit card and his answer was OH WeLL you Cannot Have it then!  Wow really he is rude ! He should have said it in a nice way ! Every time I go to Taco Bell those nice cashier gave it to me for free because I always go there . It's not that I want free stuffs it's just how he said it and it's really rude ! Bad customer service . He should have said it in a nice way ."}
{"text":"Liking the AM crunch wrap!  Great breakfast for the money, but the stigma of TACO BELL!!! will probably & unfortunately kill this concept in time."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell was the best I have ever been to. Clean, fast, fresh and the staff was great.

We always order what can only be described as a cashier's worst nightmare, or at least that is how it seems at other Taco Bell's. But our simple request of no tomatoes on a few of our tacos was no problem and the woman working the counter was friendly and repeated our order to make sure it was right. 

The shells on the Doritos Locos were fresh and not stale and chewy like we have had at other TBs.

It was close, convenient and as long as no one has bubble guts tomorrow it was well worth the stop. 

Also kudos to the counter guy who gave out the orders, he was funny and polite."}
{"text":"I accidentally gave them a review at a different location ; (  
This location gives a good customer service.
Not to mention the manager name Marissa?She pays attention to her regular customers orders. If you change or try a different order,she will ask you,just making sure she's giving you the right order.
And I also encountered another employee name Arkiel? Sorry guys,I'm bad with names . Thanks for a good customer service!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here they mess up my order. I just get off from work and get food, when i got home I realize it has meat in it. I'm vegetarian and the Taco Bell is closed now."}
{"text":"I order a bean and cheese burrito asked for 5 pumps of red sauce and payed extra for it, they wanted to tell me they would put it on the side. Nooooo. I've been to other taco bells and they do it with out a problem. It may be messy but that's how I want it. They didn't do it the 1st or 2nd time. What pisses me off is it is money i am spending so If I ask for 5 pumps of red sauce that is what I want. For me to waste my money on this food and my gas to come back and still didn't fix it right. I'm good I will never eat here again. Everrrrrrr."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today. Drive throygh was fast but they did forget my order of chips..i got the cheese just not the chips so i had to go back in. Will def come back though as the foid was good and service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I waited 15 minutes in the drive thru which was fine because I understand it was dinner time. But I get home and everything tasted like actual CARDBOARD. The chips tasted like cardboard, the cinnamon twists tasted like cardboard, even the cheese tasted like cardboard. And I'm not saying they tasted bad, they tasted how cardboard smells. Even my boyfriend couldn't eat it and he will eat anything. Won't ever be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location to go to. Food is usually always fresh, the staff is friendly and this restaurant is always clean. Joe is a very nice cashier and always remembers my name and what I order. I appreciate people that go above and beyond and Joe defienetly has.

Also Really wish you would do something about your drive thru customers blocking the entry/exit parking lots when waiting in the drive thru line. It is very inconvenient to have to wait for people in the drive thru line to move so I can get through."}
{"text":"They fired the imbeciles and now have a team who gets orders right. I no longer feel the urge to go out of my way to the other Taco Bell that's way further."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, probably one of the customer service Taco Bell experience. They are slower than most but the food is what you ordered and tasty."}
{"text":"I was here the other night with mY husband when a kid at the drive thru window handed us our food and asked us for a tip for him and his co worker. Wtf?"}
{"text":"Taco Bell hell yeah just don't go in the bathroom. order your stuff and go"}
{"text":"Arrived at the drive thru 2:09pm took the order at 2:10 been in the lane since 2:26? That's a long time for a drive thru."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and heard a male voice shout,  we are closed.  It was 10 : 45.  I also heard him say, I have a load for them.  I am returning 5 tacos tomorrow. The other taco will be tested. I asked the male that brought my order, if he had said these things.  He had to pull the ear bud out to hear me. Most ridiculous and worst service ever."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is known for its fast service and this location is no exception. Food comes fresh minutes after you order it and I have never seen this one get too busy. You must get the Dorito's Locos taco as well if you're a Dorito's fan"}
{"text":"Wow they really skimp on the steak - ridiculous! Got XXL steak burrito and just wasn't tasting meat. Opened it up after eating half and found 3 small cubes.
6 little pieces is not XXL anything; it's hardly even steak at all."}
{"text":"Ah geeezzzzz 
Taco bellyache is all i have to say.
Not coming here again.  My butt cant handle the velocity in which their food exits my body.  Something was off.  I'm not risking another episode from Taco Hell"}
{"text":"We have lived near by for 2 years and have been regularly using this place, but never have a good experience so I'm not sure why we do it.
Our order tonight was missing a taco, as usual, and mot only was our quesadilla not even melted, but the crunch wrap we got had less than a teaspoon of meat, no cheese and a few tomatoes.
The girl we had in the drive thru was either THAT new or she was high because we ordered the Beefy Cheese crunch wrap box, only to have her ask what we wanted 4 times, what kind of crunch have wrap, \"so, was that the box you wanted or just a crunchwrap?\", and asked if I wanted cheese on my quesadilla.
This hasn't been the first visit with a lousy window person, nor do I believe it'll be the last. No one they have hired has ever been focused on their job.
I have wasted countless dollars leaving without items that I have ordered. My roommates have been bold enough to go back down the road to return what they have gotten.
I just don't see why this taco bell sucks so badly."}
{"text":"I've only eaten inside once here. It was clean and smelled nice. 

I usually go thru the drive thru.

The employees are friendly and fast. My order has never been wrong. Thankfully. 

The prices are super fair. You can add on or remove different items (no beans , extra jalapeño)

I like the crunchy beef tacos and the beef burritos. I get the nacho supreme with no beans and extra jalapeños sometimes.

I know Taco Bell is Americanized \"Mexican \"food.

But it's dang good! Maybe for your tastebuds and not so much health.. but, hey 

Arriba arriba! ¡Andale ándale!"}
{"text":"This taco bell is ALWAYS incredibly slow. Today I sat in the drive through for 20 minutes before I even ordered and there were only 3 cars in front of me. Then I waited another 10 minutes to get my food. If they weren't so slow this would be a great taco bell. it shouldn't take 30 minutes to pick up some fast food."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews for fast food because most the time it doesn't change anything, but we were annoyed last night when we went to this taco bell. We were in the drive thru for over 25 mins, which is whatever I understand they get busy but my boyfriend was frustrated. When we finally get to the window to get our food we waited there for another 10-15 mins... which is absolutely ridiculous. We didn't ask for anything special except fir mild sauce... In which the employees reply was \"we will have some tomorrow, you can come back..\" WHAT... lol if I wanted it tomorrow I wouldn't have came today.. She would have been better just saying sorry we are currently out. Who trains these people. lol"}
{"text":"Went at lunch time on Friday. They are closed. Employee came to door and said they are out of everything and are not going to reopen until tomorrow maybe."}
{"text":"The drive thru is slower than the DMV. They talk to like they are too lazy to pronounce words, let alone prepare the food rapidly."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and staff is very prompt.  

The one thing I absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is!!!  I was completely stunned and amazed when I walked in."}
{"text":"My little family and I usually pull into the drive thru of this Taco Bell every Sunday. I have to say, the service is phenomenal. We always catch Michael while he's working the window and this guy is amazing. You'll know him when you hear his voice too. Lol, he sounds kind of like a announcer for a game show. We love it. 

Our orders are always right and service is a breeze. Top notch customer service! I really can't stress that enough. We are always taken care of with friendliness and a smile. This is customer service!! Thank you so much, Michael! You are phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"How does a restaurant not allow me to use the restroom to wash my hands before I order my food? You would think that would be the sanitary thing to do. \"You have to order and pay for something first.\" I'm in my work uniform. Thanks for nothing. I will pass the word."}
{"text":"Friendly team and managers!  He's a great meal and very fast!  The triple steak stack and it was great!  I also love the fire sauce."}
{"text":"The drive thru is ridiculously slow. It takes at least 15 minutes for food to be served. There are always people leaving the line. The staff is friendly but I wonder what the malfunction is. I know they aren't killing the chickens because the quality is just ok."}
{"text":"I went to this location for dinner for my family. The bill came to $32. When I got home and spread the food out for the family I found out the order was not complete. I was missing the two chicken soft tacos for one of the children. I left the family to eat their dinner and drove all the way back to the restaurant. It is 10 minutes away. I asked for the manager and told her what I was missing. She said she remembered the order but was more interested in placing blame. She made the food and literally said here. Not a sorry or anything else. My food was cold when I got home and everyone else had eaten except for the children and me. Thanks for ruining my dinner. I shall report this to the district office tomorrow."}
{"text":"i flew all the way from colorado and i was starving from the flight and drive to henderson. i stopped by taco bell and as always... i get to my parents house to find that the manager on duty which was giving me attitude from the beginning shorted me 3 tacos!!! im tired of taco bell fucking up my order!"}
{"text":"It says fast food just not at this place,it took 40 minutes to get my order wow ! I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Have waited in the drive through for close to 20 minutes now, for ONE 7-layer burrito. I only get Taco Bell once in a very blue moon, as a cheat/treat, as I keep away from fast food. This was the first location I have tried in North Carolina after relocating here. Unbelievable. Only 4 cars have been in front of me, not the entire town as you would think given the wait. They did forget about 2 layers of the said 7-layer burrito, but they only had 20 minutes to wrap it, so it was expected after all... I very rarely write reviews, but this was unacceptable enough to call for one."}
{"text":"4-15-18 11pm went to this Taco Bell after a long ass day at work.  This Taco Bell is down the street from the house, so we go here ALL THE TIME. well I guess the guys working tonight really just don't care. Ordered my food and ordered and payed for double meat. Well I get home and my food doesn't even have regular meat. I take my food back up there and the MANAGER RYAN, was extremely rude and unprofessional. It was only after waiting for 15mins, I get my refund and he decided he wanted to apologize."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a couple of years due to bad EVERYTHING!  Much to our surprise, nothing has changed! Unbelievable Taco Bell Corp. hasn't closed this dump. To make things better,the AC wasn't working. Shame on whoever owns this joke of a Taco Bell !!!!!!
Best to avoid"}
{"text":"Always get your order wrong. No matter how many times to clarify. Food was cold and disappointing. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were coming back to our hotel late from an evening with some friends, decided to stop for a late night snack. Drive thru open until 1am. We were visiting from out of town so we don't know the regular hours of the late night drive thrus. Got to this location at 1250am and the order screen was black. The car ahead of us was at the window, so I thought maybe they're doing orders at the window. Pull up, the car in front gets their food and the girl says, sorry, our system closes down 10 minutes before closing. Puzzled. I have not heard of this technology where the computer decides when your last order is placed for the evening, and at 10 minutes before closing! So don't advertise closing at 1am when you actually close at 1250am. We'll find another late night eatery the next time we are in town. This was Saturday February 25."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for two reasons, good service, and entertainment from the bus stop outside.  However, recently, I've experienced not so great service.  Gosh, I wish the teens working at night would just pay attention. Two weeks in a row now I've gotten the wrong order.  
 First one last week, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?  Hard shell chicken taco encased by a soft shell tortilla w/ cheese between the two shells.  What is the issue?  I'm going to try another location until these workers move on to the next job."}
{"text":"Yuck. Don't know why but everything I ordered was not good. There was only 1 car in front of me & it took a long time. Food was hot and order was correct but it didn't taste good. The guy at the window was nice & pleasant though"}
{"text":"This is a truly great Taco Bell.  I have had several excellent experiences here over the past 1.5 yrs, both in-store and drive thru.  

The staff is SUPER friendly, and the food is delicious and generous with the ingredients.  Always happy with the food and the employees are so darn NICE, it's always a great experience.

Note- all of my experience has been with take-out.  I have never dined in, but the place looks clean and many others were dining in today."}
{"text":"There has been a lot of improvement to this taco bell. And even with a couple mess ups here or there, they have always been kind enough to fix it immediately. It has really changed in the past couple of months. My only advice to them is to make sure you give enough sauce. Ordering 4 items deserves more than 3 packets of sauce!"}
{"text":"surprisingly for a fast food, take out place, the food was great! i ordered T11 combo steak burrito with rice in it. i upsized the french fries  for addl $1. the rootbeer wasnt diluted compared to A&W.  total cost was $9.03. if it costs a lot it should be good. that is a meal already in a resto. there is no longer a diff from a fastfood to a resto then"}
{"text":"Well it's taco bell, not Macayo's. When in a rush for a quick lunch stop it will due. Have never experienced bad service at this location, in fact, I'd venture to say it's the same as any other Taco Bell I've visited. My food is always hot and fresh and the service is reasonably fast depending on how much you order. Friendly people work the drive thru -have never been inside this location but it appears to be typical Taco Bell flair and is reasonably located for this area."}
{"text":"Awful. If I could give it no stars I would, my girlfriend and I just went through the drive thru, they seemed to be open but their menu lights were off so we had a hard time seeing what we wanted to eat. The drive thru operator rushed us and it made us very uncomfortable. As we pulled up and paid for our food another car drove beside us and asked us if they were open, we said yes. The drive thru worker saw that the car was pulling around to order and got mad and said it was because of \"this bitch\" and pointed at my girlfriend who was driving the car. I got upset and told him to cancel our order and give us our money back. We are not going to pay for food from anywhere that expresses this kind of behavior. If they did not want to take our order all they had to do was tell us that that they were closed."}
{"text":"Yes I will give the Bell 5 stars . Good cheap food ... nice comfortable tables with a \"here's your table have a seat kinda vibe. \""}
{"text":"Literally waited in the drive through for 37 minutes and there were only 5 cars in front of me... I'm actually writing this review as I sit here, so I'm hoping that the food was delivered from God himself into my bag so there is an excuse for why it took so long."}
{"text":"I think an unborn fetus is smarter than the people who work here.

Stay far away if you don't want to get the crappiest Taco Bell you have ever had.

Blah."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell in Tempe!

Consistently good every time."}
{"text":"I love this, and all taco bells, they always get my order right, have new things, are friendly, and the food is bomb (even for fast food)

Nothing like 3 huge burritos for $4 instead of shriveled soggy burgers you get on other \"dollar menu\" items."}
{"text":"The drive thru teenage girl literally made my pregnant girlfriend cry today. She was beyond rude and when my girlfriend asked if she was having a bad day, she became horribly condescending and fake nice, refused to give her a receipt and then threw a giant handful of sauce at her when she asked for some. The manager did nothing. She won't be craving Taco Bell anymore through this pregnancy."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed by the customer service I received at this location last night! I have never been so disappointed with a workers attitude. I understand the night was coming to an end, but the level of rudeness I received from this young man makes me not want to come back, even though it is the closest location to me, and my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I live about a mile away from this Taco Bell and come here quite often. The customer service is always absolutely superb and my food is always made super fast! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. A dozen people hoping for food. 20 minutes to get 2 bean burritos.  Never again."}
{"text":"I came through this store at 1 am and the lady at the window was as nice as she could be and the food was fresh. Thank you to the lady at the drive thru for being extra nice!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are here maybe once a week and they recently closed for a few weeks in order to remodel. We were very sad but excited to see the change! I can report to you yelpers of the world that it is so nice on the inside. I have been to quite a few Taco Bell's and can let you know that this is the nicest one I have been too. Parking is a bit of a challenge but well worth it! People are super nice and managers will be diligent if there are any issues. Love this TB."}
{"text":"Food is same as any other Taco bell and comes out fast. Whether I'm dining in or in the drive thru, I've never had a problem with my food coming out quickly. Never gets too packed at this location either which is why I like coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"See death walking in ... feel like it walking out. 

I'm not ashamed to admit that Taco Bell is a fast food guilty pleasure; I am too ashamed to admit what I order ($10.00 barely covers it -- I may chuckle -- but my arteries are suffocating). 

This Taco Bell has a about the seediest spot on State Street (next to a hobo community, but fortunately has a cop car sitting in the area most of the time). Beans faux Tex-Mex seasonings cannot overwhelm the bathroom cents of vagrants passing in/out of the restroom area. Outside of the potential danger of random hobo fights and shootings, this location has a lot of features.

There are a couple flat screen TVs with ESPN on constant rotation (of at least one). The service is especially friendly and really are sincere about their hospitality and getting the best mix of five or so ingredients to scarf as soon as possible. Condiments have always been well-stocked and I never walked away disappointed in the ratio of be ens and ground beef to lettuce on my double deckers."}
{"text":"I decided to write a review about the service only because I think all who eats at Taco Bell...well, it is what it is. 

Just wanted to write something about the cashier Dylan who helped us. He was super friendly and had the biggest smile on his face. We dined in tonight and we heard him greet everyone who walked in with a friendly demeanor. Unfortunately, This is not my typical experience at a fast food establishment. 

I've been here one other time and he happen to be the one who helped us. He stood out then too. He's definitely a model employee. 

Nice job Dylan! You'll go far!"}
{"text":"My usual Taco Bell is on Boulder Hwy at Russell, but it's either a 20 minute wait and/or screwed up order there, or lifeless service. What a surprise when I came this location!! I was greeted on the intercom with a smile (yes, you can actually tell when a person is smiling), my order was read back to me, I was given the total and pulled forward. Two cars ahead and it was only five minutes to get to the window!! Paid, receipt, and my food came out 30 seconds later! They are on the ball here! My new go to Taco Bell has been found."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service.  I have been to this location at different times of the day and different days of the week, each time very slow service.  

This last visit I had to repeat my order several times before the clerk got it correct. Each time he fixed one item he would remove something I wanted from the order.  He would fix that issue and then screw something else up. 

On the positive side, everything I ordered was in the bag when I left; I just should have ordered utensil and napkins since those are apparently extra."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the few Taco Bells that have decent service, a clean restaurant and the food isn't over cooked.  The rest rooms are even clean"}
{"text":"Expecting typical Taco Bell, recent visit was ok.  Nothing special.  Usual fast food Mexican."}
{"text":"I always have the most friendly service here. I always forget to look at the name badge but the manager is killing it."}
{"text":"Super clean, super fast, they got my order perfect, and the staff was VERY kind. More than I would every expect from a fast food joint. Also, the restrooms were spotless!"}
{"text":"The girl taking my order could not find the correct keys,asked me 3 times what I wanted and still got it wrong.The order was to stay,she put to go.Didn't give me a drink cup.Got beef ,I ordered chicken chulupa.The people that ordered before me had burritos missing from there order and 2 other people had there orders wrong.This place is a joke.YUM brands is a 22 billion dollar company,you would think they would have the resources to train people."}
{"text":"They screwed my sisters and I over! We asked for 3 nachos Bellgrade and a 3 freezes and a meal. The girl (Marlene) there gave us our freezes then just looks  at us then a few minutes later she handed us out food and then we waited for our drink and she asks what we wanted and then she gives us the drink and the drink has NO ice and is only filled half way!! Then when we check the bag she only gave us 2 of the 3 nachos!! Worst experience ever had! So stupid !!"}
{"text":"The customer service people, at least at this Taco Bell, are named, 'Customer Maniac.' I did receive 'jazz hands' when I walked through the door so they were excited to see me. The food was prepared to my enjoyment. The chicken soft tacos were hot and the Mountain Dew Baja Blast was ice cold. Thank you Taco Bell & Paul the 'Customer Maniac' for providing a good experience."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell....not much to say.  After they messed up our order and we left the parking, we had turn around and get it fixed. No apology. Nothing said. Just handed over the bag."}
{"text":"We ordered: 
$5 cravings box & a $5 triple melt box. 
Food was ok nothing special just what you would expect for fast food tacos. The staff was ok. Nothing to go out of you way for."}
{"text":"I like taco bell. I was very disappointed today at this location. I ordered a beef chalupa, 2 crunchy beef tacos and a bean and cheese burrito. There was a very miniscule amount of beef in the chalupa and the tacos. I have been here plenty of times. Usually I am not disappointed, but this time I was. I even went online to complete the taco bell survey, which is something I don't like to do with Taco Bell because all you get for that is a chance to enter a contest. I like surveys that will get you a free food item or a discount. After that, I even called the phone number to talk to them, but they were unavailable. I don't usually order a chalupa. I would have been better off just getting another crunchy taco, because they cost considerably less. However, my disappointment was magnified by having to pay more for the chalupa. Am I going to take that chance again? Unlikely."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer here- but my advice to anyone ordering from the drive-thru is to order your drink without ice.  Whenever I get it with ice, that's about all I get.  Driving home I'll take three sips and I'll be out of soda!"}
{"text":"My pregnancy has made me a chalupa fanatic!!!  I recommend ordering your drink with no ice though- sometimes they fill the entire cup with ice and then you are left super quenched!!"}
{"text":"Because I'm not allowed to get a negative amount of stars, one will sadly suffice for this sorry establishment called Taco Bell. I get in the drive thru wanting to feed my family after a rough day of work and take my fur babies for a ride. I live 15 minutes away so that's a drive I don't wanna drive already but it's on the way home. Anyways. I get there and ask for the five dollar craving deal. And so on I get home and first off there's not fire and mild sauce in my bag but oh well I always ask for extra so I have some here at home. Then I look through my bag and don't see my cinnamon twist. As tired as I am I call the store 6 times till I get someone on the phone and it wasn't even a manager. I tell him what's happening cause mind you i never received a receipt. The male on the phone says I'll get you a manager and the manager tells me well we'll replace it for you I ask replace what he says just the cinnamon twist I'm like okay fine whatever. The service here is not what it use to be. I don't know what's happened to customer service but I cannot deal with this type of service. I work with many people and their pets. Personally I think you should have more than just a high school diploma to get a job in fast food. At least communication classes ESPECIALLY for managers. I cannot stress it more."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell. It's my fast food of choice. This location is like most other locations. It's the closest to my house, so I go here quite often. The service is always fast and friendly. The food is consistent. As much as I like Taco Bell, it's still Taco Bell so can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Why is this place still open???!!! How is this spot still open???!!! Fire everyone with an attitude and hire a new staff. Like I was seriously tempted to drive down S Blvd to visit the TB there. 

Now working fast food isn't that difficult. I know! I used to work for KFC/TB. There were plenty times patrons got on my nerves, especially at the drive thru. But even as a teenager I reminded myself to be pleasant because my mother even reminded me that if I stay my ass in school, I don't have to do this forever. 

If it weren't for my hungry husband, I would have put in the most complicated order and then drove off. Maaaan... never again. 

Okay finally to the story. I leave dinner with the homies and just when I get in my car, my husband sends me a gif of a sallow man, indicating how hungry he is because he hasn't eaten all day. 

So I scoot on over to TB with order in hand because my dude texted it to me beforehand... (see I comes prepared). 

At first a dude tells me to go ahead with my order. 

I place my order which was very simple and then I let him know that for the drink I'll have the apple joint. I hear a girl say it doesn't come with a drink. Buuuuut I ordered one of the combo meals, heh? 

Then another girl comes on asking which meal I want. I tell her the #6 chalupa joint. She's thinking I want the #11 with a trio of some sort of tacos. Then both girls are talking to me telling me to go with with the order including combo 11. Nooooo I want combo 6. I clearly said the chalupa meal, sorry I didn't give a number but after looking, there's only one chalupa supreme combo meal. Soooo what's the confusion???? 

Finally they get it right after some attitude and two girls going back and forth with me. They're lucky the counselor in me remained calm and patient the whole time. Cause like I said in the beginning, I was seriously thinking about driving off after cussing them out for their impatience and demeanor.

This is the first time I've been to this location in years and before, they were decent, not spectacular but decent. My husband has had problems with their service recently, getting orders wrong, attitude problems. But experiencing it first hand further lets me know that next time he wants a taco run he's either going himself to deal with the buffoonery or I'm traipsing my ass to another location and he'll have to wait a little longer to eat.

But seriously they just need a new staff."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location deliberately keeps your change.  NOT KIDDING.  If they owe you $8.26, they round down and give you back $8.00.  I swear, I couldn't believe it the first time, let it go.  But, then, THEY DID IT AGAIN.  This time, I asked for the correct change, and they acted like no big deal.  Didn't even apologize.  I guess they help themselves to your change as a \"tip\".  I told the employee that he couldn't do that, and he looked at me like I was crazy.  I got my change, and I won't ever visit this location again.  If you do, make sure they give you the correct change.  Perhaps they split the overage when they close the registers at night."}
{"text":"These guys don't mess up on orders and actually are quite friendly. And who doesn't love a fourth meal?!?"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is vastly improved since I last visited it over a year ago. 

Recently, I decided to give this Taco Bell another chance since I had stopped going there because of them always getting my orders wrong. This time, they got the order right and the food was pretty good. 

In terms of service, the drive thru was pretty quick and the folks working there were friendly. This location recently underwent a remodel, so it seems that the management also got a makeover as well. 

I've stopped back since then and each time the order was correct and the service was good. I think this Taco Bell may have finally got the message regarding their lousy service and food."}
{"text":"It's just a Taco Bell nothing special. If you want processed and low quality ingredients then this place is for you."}
{"text":"If I could give this Taco Bell zero stars I would. My friend got us food from this location and the food that was handed to us was awful. 1- We did not receive a food item we ordered 2- we ordered 5 double stacked tacos featuring the cheesy layer between the two tacos. Instead of a cheesy layer we had a pasty smear with barely any cheese. 
When he took the tacos back and spoke with the manager and had the tacos remade, they came back almost the exact same with hardly any cheese. 
He asked again why the tacos didn't have cheese and the manager replied \"because it's false advertising\" referring to the pictures of the menu item

Hey Taco Bell, watch out, your employees who may be spreading bad reps about your company. It may be loosing you some customers. Also very poor customer service on their part."}
{"text":"I must say I was very disappointed in the food portions at this restaurant on South Tryon Street. Once I got my tacos I looked inside and found a very small portion of meat with lots of lettuce and cheese. I would have given no stars for the portion of foods if you had it. I complained to the counter and was told that this was the portion of meat to be given by order of the company. She went on to say if you want extra you have to ask for it huh? Why not just make the extra standard? I have included a before and after picture of my taco. Sorry to say I will not be going to any Taco's again. It's ridiculous what is served to the customer for the money they've spent. By the way there was a gentleman and his two children who actually walked out of the store because of this. This happened on June 12th 2017"}
{"text":"Drive thru is torture! Waited thirty minutes. This is the second time waiting ridiculously long at this location."}
{"text":"Didn't know if they were even open right now cuz every single light on the building is off"}
{"text":"They not only are rude but inefficient! They forgot part of my food and I had to turn around and go back but then I get all the way home and the rest of my meal was missing the sour cream that I had to pay extra for ! My daughters box meal she got didn't have the sour cream either ! SMH ! Come on people it's not rocket science it's fast food and y'all had two customers and like 5-6 employees ! Ridiculous is all I can say !"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.  If you are expecting gourmet food then you are at the wrong place.  I have been inside this location and it leaves something to be desired.  However, for a later evening food run it is ok.  The service in the drive thru is usually very friendly and sometimes funny.  It's Taco Bell though.  The food is what Taco Bell is.  Ordered a BLT crunch wrap tonight.  It was not good at all.  Taco Bell needs it off the menu.."}
{"text":"Messed up my drive thru order, Asked for BLT slider without fritos, got a beef slider without fritos."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went out to get some dinner and he ordered his food and I ordered mine. Apparently the kid named Brittany A. thought we were paying separately and only rang my stuff up. Unless you want messed up orders, don't go here. They are incompetent."}
{"text":"Really the nacho fries  are sad.  NOT worth a $1.00 then a small soda 1.69.   Lol. Taco Bell has a value meal doesn't have a dollar taco. The cashier doesn't confirm if I would like a hard or soft shell. But i guess what should I expect when it's not authentic. Taco Bell has gone up on their prices however quality of food has gone down"}
{"text":"Wow, It's hard to completely mess up a fast food joint, but they excelled at it here.  

To start with the woman running the counter was about as friendly as a rabid badger to the point of being rude. Some people just aren't cut out for dealing with people I guess.   
We had a party of 4 and when I went to fill my Tea, the container was just about empty. I used the rest up and told friendly above.  She mumbled something but it never got filled.  I also noticed the expiration date expired 3 hours earlier.  
When they brought out our food, I went to get it and as I didnt hear her actually call us, I said \"this must be ours\" since we were the only ones there.  She mumbled something again.  

Two in our party decided they wanted burrito so I ordered them.  Friendly made it seem as though I wanted to pull her teeth by disturbing her for an order AGAIN. I ordered the burrito with no sauce, friendly got it down correctly as it stated no sauce on the receipt but the guys in back messed that up, yep sauce.  The tacos were good but the messed up my 5 layer burrito also.  

Manager, if you're reading:  May 26@1900.

Sad, we just moved and this is our closest Taco Bell.  I guess I'll look for the closest Dell Taco now."}
{"text":"This is the longest wait I've ever had at a Taco Bell. Six PM on a Sunday, two cars including myself and I've already been waiting in a drive through for 20 minutes.  This is the third time I've been to this location and its a strikingly similar occurrence each time. One time the guy behind the counter flat out told me it would be a 30 minute wait, the store was empty I was the only one there.

Whoever owns this particular store may want to consider making some staffing changes ."}
{"text":"Years ago, this was absolutely the worst Taco Bell in the City of Phoenix.  Over the years it really improved.  Recently, they remodeled.  I don't know if it's the new set up, but if you come in here, expect to wait.  The service is fine, nice people who do their job well.  It just takes so long to get your order.  I really think with the remodel, the emphasis was on drive through.  People who order in were an after thought. I make this comment based on more than one visit.  Wish they would have left it alone!  I liked the old building."}
{"text":"Worst store ever.  Incomplete order in drive through.  Phone number on reciept goes to fax.  They suck."}
{"text":"OK so my first review of this place was a bit hearted,  but I have since then gone back a few times and, yes people make mistakes, that's forgivable... And that window zombie with no personal skills seems to be less of a window guy, makes me return bcz it's cheap and easy."}
{"text":"Ordered our usual at a new TB, and were blown away. They know how to make them with fresh ingredients and fill up. If you get a bad order here, hit the manager up. They know how to do it right!"}
{"text":"We had just finished eating Mad Mex, then stopped at the pet store, browsing for quite some time to stare at the adorable puppies who were in humanely sitting in their own filth, and driven from downtown Pittsburgh, and all that time that transpired was still shorter than how long we had waited to get our ONE starburst freeze drink. Luckily, the drink is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Wife was hungry for a taco so I went to Taco Bell (first time) and bought two crunchy supreme  and two crunchy tacos.  $6.09 a good price.  I took them home about 5 blocks away and as soon as we opened the bag out came a cold feeling, like when you open the reefer door.  We had to put them in the microwave for 30 seconds which turned them into a semi-warm sloppy mess oozing melted cheese and sour cream.  Needless to say we will go elsewhere when the next \"gotta have taco alarm goes off\"."}
{"text":"Stale taco shell, room temperature empanada, \"running out\" of empanadas before 10pm, fountain drink with no flavor; pretty much just carbonated water...experiencing these things just once is enough to turn most people off. Unfortunately, I've experienced some of them multiple times at this location. I'll probably just have to start going to the location that takes twice as long to reach. I still give 3 stars because at least the service is decent."}
{"text":"Just wentto drive thru and bought $28.81 worth of food.  Got home and found my Nachos Bel Grande was not in the ONE BAG they stuffed everything into.  I tried to call and complain but the phone was not answered.  I tried 3 times. So I drove back and gave the guy my receipt and told him what was missing. He said \"Let me get that for you\" a few minutes later he came back and handed me a bag.  Now everone makes mistakes.. sure I was the only customer there and it shouldn't be that hard to look at an order, make it and bag it... especially if tahts what you do all day.. but the problem for me was that I had spent my time ans gas while my food got cold at home and he never even said \"sorry\".. no offer of anything to make up for it.. nothing other than giving me the food that I paid for and shouldn't have had to come back for.  So I told him that it was bullshit that he didn't even say sorry and he sai \"I did\" I told him no you said let me get that for you and told him taht I wasted tie and gas ti come back.. he said \"oh well you can call and tel my general manager!\" Really?  Oh I will and I just finished the Tell The Bell Survey.. I worked fast food before.. I did 23 years behind a deli counter at a grocery store.. I know how a customer should be treated.. this was the opposite of that...  so I go home and start to eat my cold food and it is horrible. not from being cold but from how they made it.. the bean and cheese burrito was timy, smashed and had almost no cheese.  The mexican pizza my wife got was thrown together, ingredients everwhere except where they should be. The pintos and cheese were the worst.. The beans were so dry they crunched.  Probably the worst food I heve ever had from a taco bell.. maybe from any fast food place ever!  So now tomorrow I will be calling to complain to whoever will listen at the store and at the corporate office.  I highly reccomend avoiding this location."}
{"text":"Fast gods? Hah not really ! Been diluting in the line for 15 minutes  . What is wrong with this place?"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is definitely my favorite fast food and out of all the locations that I go to I would have to say that this is my favorite the staff is always friendly and the managers always take their time to say hello"}
{"text":"Taco Bell, is well Taco Bell.

We have been coming here a few times each month whenever we go grocery shopping at nearby Fry's.  It's a cleans store with some very nice employees who rarely get the order wrong.  We also usually see and have gotten to know the franchise owner, he's always about checking on things.

But not a lot has changed since Glenn Bell first made that chicken wire contraption to invent the hard shell taco over sixty years ago.  Recently though, corporate owner Yum Brands has taken to upgrade the menu with offering from Chef Lorena Garcia's authentic Latin recipe premium items called Cantina Bell.  They have also rolled out this past summer a tie-in from Frito-Lays for a Doritos hard shell taco.  Both items are good and tasty.  

I have a unwritten rule that most fast food places can only aspire to Three Stars, or in Yelp-ese \"A-OK\" ratting.  Given the uniformity of fast food, it's hard to set them apart from another fast food place.  But, I like this franchise owner for his hustle and how he keeps on top of things and actually manages his chain of stores.  So Three and a Half Stars to him and this location!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience. I went in and ordered my food, it was quick and delicious. My food was brought to me by a girl who I didn't catch her name but she had short hair I think with some red in it. Anyways, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Ab extremely cheap place to have normal Mexican food. The dishes aren't that great if you compare them to the ones authentic Mexican restaurants offer but it's a convenient place for drive by pickups. I would personally recommend the beef nachos and chalupas at this place."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes. Its so ridiculous that it takes them this long to get orders out."}
{"text":"I just moved to this area and this is the closest taco bell to my house. I've been there six times now and not once has my order been right, its always a surprise what I will receive."}
{"text":"They always forget parts of my order. Last time I got food poisoning. 

The employees are always nice but not worth the risk."}
{"text":"I asked for a cup of water with my meal. The water literally tastes like it has dirt in it. Are we not advanced enough as a society to not have to worry about water tasting like it has dirt in it? Can I get some clean water to drink with my meal? Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"While I was here the person in front of us asked for no sour cream on her taco and they messed up her order and short story later she had a allergic, she was aperantly deathly allergic to sour cream"}
{"text":"Wow! I was really impressed by my experience here today! The cashier inside was great at helping me choose something from the menu. He was friendly and knowledgable! The employees were patient yet quick. The restaurant was clean. My food was delicious and tasted much better than the last time I had been here. The iced tea was also amazing! As I was leaving the cashier held the door open for me and was very polite! I will definitely be back, I was really impressed!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for Taco Bell pretty fast.  Its probably the fastest drive thru in town when you in a rush. They even ran me down when they forgot to put my Empanada in the bag. The prices just need to go down on some items."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has messed up more of my orders than any of the fast food spots in the area combined."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I wanted to say they did fine, because the reviews just trashed them and I was in and out within 10 minutes in the drive thru. After their machine refused to scan my card the first 20 times. 

Once we left, I checked my order, and of course it was wrong. I went in the front door and requested the jalapeño honey chicken grilled taco that I ordered for a second time. And the lady told the people cooking and they say \"it's on the grill right now\" to me personally. After about ten minutes of me standing and waiting for one taco, while the rest of mine and my wife's dinner got cold, a manager finally approached the counter and asked what I was waiting for. Finally she asks the cooks and they have no idea what's going on. One cook finally double checks and says \"sorry would you like this instead?\" By this point I wasn't waiting ANOTHER ten minutes for the chicken to be cooked. So I said fine. For the next 3 minutes while I waited for THAT one to be made, I got to listen to them all laugh and goof off while my order was jacked up for a half hour. Never again will I give you the benefit of the doubt, Taco Bell. Never again. 

Find a new Taco Bell if you want decent service and dinner on time."}
{"text":"5 stars because Taco Bell is my favorite place, but this location was.m not up to my typical TB standards. Jared, the cashier is an absolute dear and he should be a manager, but the food was so subpar. My bean burritos were leaking and the beans seemed like they were days old. The nachos were put in my bag upside down- so not cool."}
{"text":"I like getting the Nacho Burrito, Steak Quesidillas, and the Chicken Burrito from here with fire sauce, even though it's still not that hot."}
{"text":"Slowest taco bell in the city. Avoid if at all possible. Go to the one at indigo and Charleston if possible. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"They take 20 minutes in drive through! Can't hear shit so you need to write the order and just hand it to them. Idiots!!!"}
{"text":"Can any Taco Bell be 5 stars. Maybe for the brief moment you indulge in feeding yourself but this one is as good as any and well situated whether you're not in the mood for the nearby Costco food or the more refined Chipotle."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of fast-food but I got a craving for Taco Bell when I was reminiscing on my undergraduate college days. Over to Taco Bell I go.

This is the closest location to me, hence why I came here. I went through the drive through, and it was a little slow but eventually it moved. It's been about two years since I've had this stuff so I asked the girl behind the mic what she would recommend, and I went with her recommendation of the Dorito crunch thing? I also ordered my all-time Taco Bell favorite-- the cheesy potatoes (if you haven't had them, you are not real). 

The girl was sweet throughout, and when I got home which is a short 7 minute drive, my food was really cold but even worse, the potatoes were actually rock hard, well half of them were. They're not normally supposed to be like that, which made me sad but what can I do.

Overall a good, convenient location with many other establishments such as Target, Walmart, Burlington Coat Factory, Aldi's, etc. If I go here again, I will check my food before leaving."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks. They forgot my burrito. We drove 45 minutes to go to this specific location and they forgot MY BURRITO! The bill was $30, and was the last $30 in my bank account. I saved up my tips to provide a healthy meal for me and my 6 kids and those idiots all got their dorito tacos and guess what I'm left with?? NOTHING. I will never give this rotten cheese smelling, rat festering, spoiling Santa Clause for little kids, dirty establishment my business again. Del Taco would NEVER do me like this. Goodbye Taco Bell forever."}
{"text":"I think this place is amazing! I am not exagerating when I say that they have the friendliest staff ever. I will drive out of my way to go to this location. They are always positive and my orders are always fresh and accurate. For being a fast food spot, I am amazed at their high level of service and commitment to their customers. I def recommend!"}
{"text":"I got home with a hard taco, felt light and when I looked down at it, there was no meat. Just lettuce and cheese. Mmmmm salad taco, that was worth 89 cents! Not. Same day my entire order tasted like cardboard and the Hawaiian lady at the window was completely rude. If I see her at the window after placing my order, I just keep driving thru the line, don't need her attitude. The boys who work there are funny, forgetful but funny. Was once given 3 drinks and no straws, so I had to park and go inside for them, he apologized and all was forgiven. Be an airhead and polite and I'll forgive you, but be an airhead and rude? You get 2 stars!"}
{"text":"To keep it one hundred the employees here are so nice. Came in right before closing & they weren't even mad. Props to this location! Christaan checked me out and she was super friendly! 10/10"}
{"text":"What are you expecting me to say... it's taco bell! They do a good job advertising to young hip kids so of course I go in everytime those damn commercials come on, load up on free sauce packets. Haven't had to buy hot sauce in years.  

Oh yeah and there tacos are good too."}
{"text":"So I decided to try the \"amazing\" burrito bowl... I dot know where to begin..

The rice was dry and hard, chicken didn't taste like chicken, the rest of the ingredients didn't stand out and just tasted weird. I could barely choke down half of it before giving up... I have eaten many of their offerings, none have come close to this atrocity.

I can't believe Lorena Garcia put her name behind this! If in were in her shoes, no matter the pay, I would not disgrace myself like that..    

They should take this off the menu today!

P.s. If their bathroom indicated the quality of their food - I would give the a minus -100"}
{"text":"I have always checked reviews on a place prior to going there, so when I looked up the google reviews on this place I was a little shocked at the negativity, so I'm gonna do this T-Bell justice! First I will start off by saying the Customer Service here is nothing less then phenomenal! Anybody who says otherwise might want to reevaluate themselves because they are probably the ones who are A**holes. The employees and management here have my respect! I've never had food here that was upsetting to me which is saying something since usually taco bell has me on the porcelain begging for mercy. Inside was a little dirty but maybe I just came at a bad time because usually its pretty clean. Thank You Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude customer service. Place smells like a toilet when you walk in. When entering the building Make sure you scream loud enough for an employee to hear you so they can take your order.... 
don't ask any questions about the menu and for the love of god don't order more than 3 things"}
{"text":"Josh was so nice we couldn't have dairy and made sure out order was correct. Also had a friend who was at Taco Bell for the first time and he made it so memorable! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"And the award for sloppiest tacos in a bag goes to this Taco Bell!! My taco was completely open upside down spilled everywhere. F**king full of n!g3rs!!! I'm sorry but if you act like one your getting called one"}
{"text":"Food was great.
The people working here were super friendly.
And THE restaurant and the toilet were very clean. And the food was very cheap. So thank you Taco Bell Boulder City !"}
{"text":"Near my home,always polite,prompt service and I usually have a sister wife & family spotting here! I wish they'd carry brewed ice tea and dr pepper!"}
{"text":"Prompt service, did a great job substituting beans for beef as requested and had ample sauce packets out front.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This location is great. The employees here are amazingly friendly and always smiling!! They actually look you in the eye when you speak to them.
Both girls at the Windows tonight were great!"}
{"text":"Fast food made slow. At least it was made in front of me. Too bad i was actually in a hurry."}
{"text":"Late night after an inventory and the night shift lead made my experience at 230am enjoyable and entertaining. The best use of puns I've ever heard. Truely knows what customer service is."}
{"text":"Tell me how the shift lead is on the phone and says I need to take this call too someone else needs to take the orders. Talk about amazing service...if your phone call is that important then maybe you should stay home."}
{"text":"I don't know of they expect anyone coming inside at 930 in the morning but at least sjow people.you care about your store. All tables had a mess on them looks like the night crew did nothing at all! Extremely sad"}
{"text":"I've never gone to this establishment and got what I actually ordered. They couldn't even take the time to give me my drink tonight. This is on top of the fact that they told me they were out of half the things I wanted to order.... You're target market is late night eaters, you'd think you'd have what they would want. Worst restaurant in Lakewood. I love Taco Bell but this location is the worst I've ever dealt with. Please hire some more competent employees. I can't stand dealing with these \"special people\" literally just lazy losers. Hire some people that actually know what they're doing. They're begging for $15 an hour maybe once they get someone's order right, they'll deserve $5 an hour"}
{"text":"Been going here for years and my order is wrong nearly every time. On top of that, they have been out of an item I want on numerous occasions. The credit card machines are always broken, the drive through box is broken as we speak, the lady asks me to order then stops me in the middle of my order because she's not ready. Lines take forever on drive through. Frustrating experience every time I come. Don't go here, take the extra five minutes and go to the taco bell on happy valley."}
{"text":"Love me some Taco Bell and this one just got a facelift. Decided to go inside as well and it's similar if not identical to the recently renovated ones you can find here and there. The orders have always been correct, the service and cleanliness is good and that's about all you can ask from a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Very poor service! Not a single time they have made my order completely right. And i use the app to order so they have instructions clearly in front of them. Just today,i selected no lettuce in my 3 tacos and all tacos had lettuce. I selected orange juice as drink which they never gave and i forgot to ask too i wasn't thinking much was in hurry. Value for money food wise but service needs major improvement!"}
{"text":"Had a very rude experience with a cashier, her name is Ashley and she has short bleached hair with very dark eye makeup..I came in and asked if they had a menu with calories and she told me if I wanted to be healthy I shouldn't eat at Taco Bell, it was uncalled for and she shouldn't have said it. I told her I would get a soft taco and she told me to get the supreme because it has tomatoes on it, she said it in a mocking way and I finally decided to walk out, she shouldn't be working with customers if she doesn't know how to be courteous to people"}
{"text":"I have loved Taco Bell ever since I can remember...back when the Chili Cheese Burrito was called the Chilito.
This location holds to the high standards a fast food restaurant should adhere to:
Clean
Fast Service
Friendly Staff"}
{"text":"Seriously! I live right behind this excuse of a Taco Bell and unfortunately I'm subjected to their constant torture. This location is a JOKE of a business. There's no captain on this ship! Constantly out of ingredients and god forbid they get your order right. You will make it home with someone else's order or your entree missing. Not to mention the WAIT TIME. 15-20 minutes almost every time. Forget about eating at this location after 8 Pm the wait times are astronomical. 4th meal. Ha! Yeah right. You  would think I would have learned my lesson by now but I keep giving this location 3rd,4th,and 5th chances and every time the joke is on me. Not to my surprise I tried to go for lunch at 1:00 pm this past Friday 5/18 and the doors were locked with signs on them saying that they were closed and would reopen later that afternoon. How in the world do you close for lunch on a Friday? No exaggeration but this isn't even the first time this has happened here. This franchise owner should do us all a favor and sell to someone who knows how to run a business or get some people in there that can right these wrongs. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a Taco Hell... The cashier, Lani, who served us even knew how to do basic math in her head!!!  

It's really sad when you are impressed that a cashier can do this at a fast food place, but good for Lani for not following the register and giving my friend $206,000 when the register created an error for itself. :)  She didn't even pull out a calculator. :)

But that would have been a great win on the way to Vegas.

Lani was friendly and took control of it all with a smile. :)  It was great... she said, \"It's fast food, not rocket science\". 

I had to die laughing when I heard that one. :)

Bathroom was clean and everything was well stocked."}
{"text":"So kids, if you've been following along at home, you know Uncle Georgie thinks most fast food places can only strive for a 3 Star rating or worst. 

Uniformity at fast good places in my opinion make it impossible to offer a Four Star, or Eccck... a Five Star rating. Sorry, Yum Brands!  

But this isn't a ghetto location and the employees aren't brain dead. On the contrary, they're all very nice and friendly. Especially Mallory up front and Becky the Manager who went out of their way. Nice!

As for the food, it's okay. The Tacos were good, as for the cheese Pizza Hut pizza, while being slightly undercooked it was also A-Okay. 

BTW, I had no problems getting a cup for water. So that must have been an isolated incident the other reviewers had on their visit. 

So Three Stars, A-Okay"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I understand that mistakes happen.  I ordered 2 Chicken Quesadillas without the green sauce that is put on it and wanted red sauce instead.  After I received my order and realized it had the green sauce on it the manager was more interested in telling me the sauce isn't green it's actually tan. They always get you in the drive through. Waste of $8. From looking at the other complaints on here it doesn't appear the ownership or the management even care."}
{"text":"I officially received the smallest bean burrito ever.  I mean, ever.  It measured 6\" long x 1.5\" wide x less than 1\" thick.  See photos. WTH Taco Bell?!  That was the worst $1.39 I've ever spent and I deserve a refund.  Unfortunately, I got takeout and am not driving back there."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. If you have special instructions, nobody cares. If you order something with back cheese, (nachos or the new fries), don't expect to get any more than one nacho or fry of cheese to dip your order into. Past time I've ordered no sour cream, it's had extra. I'm now fully convinced that these people have ZERO CONTROL OF THIS PLACE. I'm done going here. 
I'm aware of far more places to spend money at. 
This won't be one. 
Best of luck- you all NEED HELP!!"}
{"text":"I order a power bowl and I literally waited and hour to get it. This is the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. The mangers were just sitting down doing nothing. I usually don't complain but this was unacceptable. I love Taco Bell but I will not be returning to this one . Just go to the Taco Bell by boardwalk instead !!!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost every night how is it possible that my order is always messed up in someway how... I usually always order fiery in always seem to get regular. I ask for supreme and they never put sour cream I literally just start keeping it stock in my refrigerator but they charge almost a $1 for that SMH it's horrible. Half the time I go they aren't busy so what is reasoning my order is messed up other then people not giving a shit. I want what ask for I, I expect to get what I paid for. It's like I get home in what the fuck who wants to drive all the way back or deal with the attitude of the people its a waste of my time. I have try calling in to talk to general manager & have left message but never hear back. Yes I get its only Taco Bell but it's still a restaurant...so just make it like how people ask. I am a reoccurring customers but at this put rate there no point I could buy the normal tacos and make them at home! I guess I will have to do without my fiery taco since I basically never get it anyways! I hope this place gets it shit together it's been like year in still every time my husband but seriously everytime! What is the purpose of the phone if you don't answer !"}
{"text":"Very yummy food, a little bit cold. Nice cashier though, didn't get his name. 4/5 will come back! (:"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the drive through for over twenty minutes now. This is unbelievable."}
{"text":"My brother already went through one mishap with an employee (employee more focused on his phone)from another Taco Bell, only to come to this one to find that there was a vehicle parked blocking the drive-thru (purposely). He got out to see if everything was ok but saw nothing out of the ordinary"}
{"text":"Not sure what to say. My brother just stopped by this location a few minutes ago and sat in the drive-thru for quite some time. Only to see that the young man was messing around on his phone in the dining room the whole time and not paying  attention"}
{"text":"I'm not saying I am proud of this, but I eat a lot of taco bell. I just moved to this side of town and this has is now my new favorite Taco Bell. They passed the shredded chicken burrito test. It was evenly chicken, rice and sauce throughout. Not dry rice in one end, a little chicken in their somewhere, and one end all globbed with sauce #mcdowelltbdowntown. The mexi melt was also perfect. Not all messy and falling apart. Good job baseline south mountain village tb."}
{"text":"I visited this Taco Bell a couple months ago; I was starving and it was pretty late at night.  I am *so* glad I did!  Things have greatly improved, both with service times and order accuracy!  It seems like the entire staff is new, they are much faster, polite and my orders have all been accurate (even my requests for no lettuce on tacos!)  I'm glad they've improved since they are pretty close to my house, and I love Taco Bell.  I have no problems visiting this location anymore, and I hope it stays this way!  Nice Job!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes, no food. Asked for refund, clueless front counter guy couldn't connect the problem.  3 others got refunds, two people in line were told the situation and left."}
{"text":"Drive thru takes 5 minutes per car. Just be prepared. Even In N Out is faster than that.
Also, prices are higher than what's advertised on TV."}
{"text":"Had my be guest experience at this location today thanks with Arionna W. She was my cashier and had such wonderful energy it honestly put me in a better mood from when I arrived! I come to this location at least 3 times a week and she was the sweetest cashier I've experienced. Raise is well deserved for such excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Alot better location then the one on 43rd.  Some times u get ppl that u cant even understand.  And they mess up ur food.  But its just a hit or miss."}
{"text":"This location is the worst!  The 1st time i went through the drive thru and saw some girl making my food without gloves.  And after that she ran behind the corner and started Eatting.  It was fucking nasty.  Then i figured i would try n go one more time to see if they changed and they didnt.  I got my burrito made wrong.  With the wrong  sauce. And in the nacho's there was a hair!  I tryed calling to complain but there phone dont even work!?  What kind of place  is this.  They dont even deserve one star."}
{"text":"I've been here like 100 time (embarrassing) and I've literally never had a bad experience.  The staff is amazing, chick-Fila  nice- but it's actually genuine.  Seriously, the staff is always so happy and accommodating.  You don't receive that at any of the competition. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"On this particular visit I went inside since I had repeatedly been dissatisfied with the drive-thru service.  Also, since my orders had been repeatedly wrong, I thought that I may do better by being face to face with the cashier.  I asked for a side of baha sauce since the last time neither of the cheezy gordita crunches had any sauce.  I don't just mean scant, I mean NONE!  While, they did manage to include that in my bag, I had also requested that the 2 crunchy tacos be upgraded to Supreme which is an added cost.  When I got home I found that all they had on them was meat, lettuce and cheese.  However, looking at my receipt, I say that I was indeed charged for Supreme Tacos.  While I still love the cheezy gordita crunch, I won't be going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"New First Meal/Breakfast Review:

A couple of months ago the AZ Republic had coupon inserts for Taco Bell's roll-out of their new breakfast menu. They call it The First Meal. Not being a breakfast person, I ignored it. 

Well, several months later, more and more TBs are starting to serve breakfast.  Soon almost all their Phoenix locations will have it. What can you expect?  Typical Taco Bell faire with some interesting twists. 

Their big new item, is something call the \"AM Crunchwap\".  Your choices are either bacon or sausage. I tried the bacon and it's quite good.  It's a little smaller than their normal Crunchwrap, maybe 3/4 of inch.  It's filled with scrambled egg, bacon, cheese and a creamy Jalapeno sauce that gives off a little heat.  Yummy!

The key to the sandwich, besides the flavorful sauce, is a very thin circular hash-brown that is in the middle of the wrap.  I liked it and it's priced at only $2.49 each. BTW, breakfast is served until 11 am.

Should Mickey Ds next door start worrying? No. But along with their Bacon or Sausage Skillet (Soft Taco) for $0.99, it's a nice alternative.  The Combo meal ran me slightly less than $4.00, excluding tax.  

Surprisingly, there doesn't seem to be any decent coffee option.  When I paid, the server offered me a medium drink. Taco Bell's First Meal won't change my habit of skipping breakfast, but I might give them a try every couple of months.

Wow, I just gave a Taco Bell Four Stars.  D'oh!"}
{"text":"I ate at this Taco Bell location on sunday 09/26/15 and i got the GI Bug. I have not been able to eat and have been very sick. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"DONE WITH THIS PLACE. Pathetic. The corporate office should fire the regional manager for allowing this place to be so pathetic. Staff changes alot, consistently bad. Food quality is a gamble and usually substandard and the wait time????????? Bank on waiting 30 minutes no matter what you get. This location irritates me and I stay out of it now because I've been MORE than patient but they continue to be terrible. Again, this place has been consistently bad and the regional manager- who is ultimately responsible- should be fired for not addressing the longterm issues at this location."}
{"text":"Waited over 25 minutes for a one-person order. I've never seen such. A gentleman also waiting said several months ago it was also this slow and he was giving them another chance. DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!
An update: when I finally got my food I gave a polite 'thank you' and was given a \"hurumph\" in return. Rudest customer service ever. Except the younger kid working the register and trying to be friendly. I felt bad for him... especially if the cranky lady who handed me my food is his manager."}
{"text":"I don't normally review chain places anymore but I'll say this -- this Taco Bell isn't that good as far as Taco Bells go. I don't know why but some ingredients -- especially anything with rice -- tastes awful. I don't know if the Taco Bell/KFC's use a different ingredient base but I can't believe how bad things like the Cheesy Bean and Rice burrito taste. Other than that, it's Taco Bell..what's to say?"}
{"text":"Went around dinner time so it was super busy inside and drive thru but the line went pretty quick. The worker that was at the drive thru was very nice and professional!! Everything was delicious! Will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Okay people this is a long one please bear with me. I visited this Taco Bell at 3:42 p.m. on March 26th 2017. I pulled in and proceeded to wait 10 + minutes in line to get up to the ordering speaker. No problem everyone wants Taco Bell the food is great. Once I got to the speaker I was told to please hold which again they are busy and is very normal I understand waiting one or two minutes. Once I waited 7 or 8 minutes I had started asking if they were still there with absolutely no response. I pulled around to the window so I could order there or there would be no more confusion as I already knew everything I wanted. Once I got to the window I was informed that I was going to have to pull back around and wait in line again because the people behind me ordered first. I told them that won't be necessary I was here first they can go ahead and make my meal and I would like to please speak with a manager for being told to pull around. The manager was busy both times I asked for him with paperwork in his office and could not come talk to me. Once I brought up corporate they at least decided to go ahead and make my meal which they insisted was a favor to me. They also went ahead and told me they threw in a free to ounce tub of salsa and gave me and insulting $1.10 senior discount on my meal. I insisted I pay for the whole thing if nothing would be comped because that is insulting and I am only 28 years old. I waited for my food as I didn't want to piss people off who were handling it and once I received it I inform them that I would be contacting corporate for their poor handling of their customers. Once I got home I proceeded to call the Taco Bell I receive my food from to see if I can contact a manager. After not getting through the first time and the phone line being busy for the next half hour I ended up getting a hold of a guy whose name started with a Pz...  not sure how to spell or pronounce the actual name as he refused to spell it for me and said I need to know what you're calling about before I give you any information. Before I gave him information he had no issue giving me the names of Claudia and Gary who were not there. He continued to refuse to admit they done anything wrong to me and even went as far as to tell me they went above and beyond to make me happy much further than any other restaurant would have done. I know that was a lie but that's okay I have no reason to scold him I just informed him that I would be contacting corporate because I was not happy with this answer. Immediately he told me to come back to the restaurant and he would give me a free meal right now. I told him that's unnecessary as I am eating the meal I already bought with my measly $1.10 discount which he insisted was huge. I had no reason to have to leave my house again to come back to this workaraunt. (Sorry I couldn't help myself) when he realized that I did not appreciate such an insulting discount AZ trying to make his customers happy he did tell me \" I guess all I can say is I'm sorry\" with absolutely no empathy and his voice whatsoever. I know you want Taco Bell. This food is great. Next time I advise you two head about a mile-and-a-half West on McDowell take a right and head north to Thomas go to the Taco Bell there as the food is always great and the staff is always friendly. I've never had a situation where I had to talk to the manager there but I'm sure they would jump to the occasion. The Taco Bell that I visited today would be better suited to shut down and open up another fast food chain or management will care more and that way we can have more versatility in the area. The staff from employee to management here at Taco Bell on McDowell in my opinion is absolutely incompetent. Thank you for reading and enjoy the Thomas and Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Went to the drive through and they were very fast and courteous.  Always great service and well made food.   Gaven was awesome!  I like extra sauce and she made sure i had enough. She was also very freindly.  Always great!"}
{"text":"This place is actually a combo KFC and Taco Bell.  I find Pepsico does this, combining restaurants which is fine because you can get a Big Crunch sandwich and a fries supreme.

Taco Bell has a build your own combo for 5 bucks and a larger one for 10 along with a dozen pack of originals for like 16 dollars now I think.  As far as KFC it's buckets and combos as well as strips etc. 

For cheap eats it's Taco Bell though.  I found individual items aren't really priced on the menu anymore so you will have to ask how much for etc if you're down to change like I was last night.  A fries supreme is 3.15 after tax by the way."}
{"text":"I have two main issues with this Taco Bell. The first is that they do not have the $5 Cravings Deal, which is my favorite thing to get from Taco Bell. It's a fast food staple for me and them not having it here is very disappointing. The second issue is that the bathroom is abnormal. It's big enough to fit at least 2 stalls and a urinal but instead they made it a single bathroom with 1 toilet, 1 urinal, and a lock on the door. I was so taken aback that I peed in the toilet instead of the urinal. I am going to try to find a different Taco Bell to frequent."}
{"text":"Every time I/we go the cashier is very nice. We've never had our orders messed up, and the food has always tasted great for something quick to eat. Also the box deals that they have are convenient and budget friendly."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their Beefy Crunch Burritos aka BCBs. I first tried one last year at UNLV's taco bell and I was blown away. CHIPS in a burrito?! I'm all for crunchy things in a not so crunchy food thing. Yep then it was taken away for a short while but BROUGHT BACK! I didn't even have to do anything. Beef, cheese, rice, and spicy Fritos....omg. Best eaten with Mild sauce. Please never take the BCB away again. Oh and 4 stars for this location for having pink water. What....?"}
{"text":"I pulled into the drive through at about 5:30 PM. I finally got my food at 5:53 PM. I ordered just a couple things but this branch always seems to take forever. So I finally get my food and the food is correct but the amount they charged me is wrong. The items listed on my receipt aren't even what I received. I guess I need to call and complain. The three things I ordered should've cost me $6.67 but instead I was charged $8.55."}
{"text":"Rode through the drive through around 10pm. The guy ask me to order when ready three times. Finally I order out of pressure to order quickly. Then the guy says \"ok boss man.\" And somehow finds a way to say \"boss man\" twice more in 10 seconds. I felt so uncomfortable I drove around, drove past the pick up window and kept driving until I got home. I got in an argument with my girl and went to bed hungry. F U Taco Bell employee."}
{"text":"We had ordered three items and left to go home. Upon arriving home we noticed the employees switched a burrito in place of the nachoes we ordered. We drove all the way back to retrieve the rest of the order. We entered the drive thru behind a white sedan that had a dog. The employee stuck out his hand to pet the dog and in turn the dog licked his hand for several seconds. Michael M then proceeded to hand us the nacho with his dog breath hands. GROSS."}
{"text":"I went there at 7:30 A.M. to have breakfast because my sister said that the store should be opened by then, and it was not opened. I thought that maybe they are not opening in the morning, but then I saw two posters on the windows saying that they should open at 7:00 A.M. with the breakfast menus. I do not know why they did not open the store. All of my family members wasted time going to the store. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food came out fast, service was okay and food was good.
Down side is that every time I eat their food I have crazy stomachaches. 
I had a hard shell taco and a burrito. 
Despite the stomachache I will be back eventually."}
{"text":"This is the worst taco bell I have ever been to. It is also the slowest. I remember one time I ordered a burrito and the rice was bad hard and crunchy, SO I call and go get another one. Guess what they put the same nasty rice on it. Didn't even take the time to make new rice after the complaint. Called back and told the manager he was a joke. This place is also very skimpy with the meat and cheese. I have had tacos where half the shell only had lettuce and you could easily count the shreds of cheese (less than 10). But this place has been like this for over a decade and they are not about to change so I never go there."}
{"text":"Leaving a review for Taco Bell.  I can't believe it but the drive through attendant, she was so sweet polite and businesslike. The food was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Omg!! Slow as ever. Went in to get kids food order 2 boxes took over 20 plus min. This is most unprofessional dirty place"}
{"text":"Love it. Very nice service lately. Young thin girl works at the drive through, and she is sooooo nice!! Long hair and a bit brownish!!!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment.  This is the first Taco Bell i've been to where you had to wait for over 13 minutes to get your food.  The sad thing is that they weren't busy.  If you go, bring a fidget spinner to keep you entertained."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Taco Bell! They have the BEST staff, cold inside, clean, and they just remodeled."}
{"text":"So, explain to me WHY I paid for 6 sides of nacho cheese, only to get 6 small cups with literally ONE tablespoon each, and I was charged $3 for literally 3 TABLESPOONS?! To top it off, I ordered a tostada... what I got was a soggy a** tortilla with some crap toppings thrown on it. What the h*ll kind of business is this HORRIBLE excuse for a food establishment?!? 

I seriously want my money back! Not only will I absolutely NEVER visit this location again, but I certainly plan on bringing this sorry excuse for \"food\" back promptly upon opening because the fact I was actually charged for this CRAP is inexcusable!! 

Get your establishment together or get some new employees who actually appreciate having a job & providing customers with what they PAY for because this is NOT okay when I just spent the money I work for on food that SHOULD be done RIGHT and SHOULD be actually EDIBLE! I am beyond angry I paid for what looks like it literally was removed from the dumpster!!! 

The other members of my party I was picking up food for would also like to know WHY they not only got ripped off, but had literal TRASH to eat!"}
{"text":"245pm on a Sunday. Waited in drive thru for over 15 minutes and still didn't have food ready. This place sucks. Never go here."}
{"text":"Great customer service from  Crystal! She was genuinly Sweet AND Extremely Pleasant--very rare here in Vegas. Thanks for helping make our visit an enjoyable one ;))"}
{"text":"Taco Bell has blown it with this new \"Dollar Cravings Menu\" The items on it are just rehashed versions of things that were already on the menu for cheaper prices. Not to mention the sizes are half the size of the original product."}
{"text":"First!!! Very good customer service, got our huge order right, wish they were open a bit later. Great job!"}
{"text":"Never again. 
I came here to grab 2 bean burritos. I pulled in and the drive-thru had about 5 cars, so I went inside. No one was waiting to order, yet there were 7 ppl waiting for their food to be given. The cashier never addressed me, just stared at me. They had one creation line going and the 2 ladies were not aware at all of the term \"FAST food.\" The manager was just as slow, as she very slowly moved around the store. I waited 25 mins for BEAN burritos! The staff was/is lazy & just didn't care, including the manager! Is it possible to mess up a bean burrito??? YES! All you have to do is make someone wait 25 mins & then serve burnt beans inside the burrito. So I'm clear, this store was not slammed with customers & they were not understaffed.
Someone should tell the owner. 
The next Taco Bell is 15 mins away. Next time I'll spend 25 mins again, but 15 of it will be drivetime.
Never Again."}
{"text":"The management at this location is a joke and all but one of the managers needs to be fired as well as half the crew, I have personal second hand knowledge that I believe that shows that the general manager is a possible racist  & a poor excuse for a human and also the management doesn't respect the people that work under them. 

The general manager likes to yell at her crew while standing around playing in her phone as well as she doesn't trust her own crew, nor does she take the initiative to see to it that her new employee's receive the proper hands on training but rather relies on the companies training videos to teach new employee's

The Assistant manager is a joke in his own way, he doesn't communicate with the other managers and allows those that are his favorites to stand around and do as they please while making the employee's that aren't his favorites do all of the work, this manager also relies too much on the  companies training videos to teach new employee's

Both of them have been herd talking about other employee's behind their backs and to me this shows a total lack of respect for the crew that works for them, they need to realize that not all employee's can learn everything from a training video and that the new employee's need hands on experience and not just one hour a day.   

Having worked for several fast food companies over the years I can say that I have never had a management team as bad as the ones that manage this location. I always watched the video's but also received more than enough hands training till the management was sure that I could work at any station.  

The parent company of this location needs to make a surprise unannounced visit to this location several times and if the security camera's have mics on them they should listen to what is really happening at this location. 

This location needs to take a page from the McDonald's hand book on how to train new employee's and read it several times. 

I would not encourage anyone to put in an application at this location for a job unless you enjoy being treated like shit and being talked about behind your back."}
{"text":"Yes I know its almost taboo to review a fast food place, but when a yelper gets annoyed, she's gonna yelp.  Loud.  I worked and ran errands from early morning to almost 3 pm, without breakfast or lunch on Sunday.  I figured I need something right now, so Taco Bell it was (plus I like to jack some extra fire sauce packets for my kitchen drawer---taco night 
is coming up ;-D  Anyway, I walked in and the music is just blaring, I mean sure Im not 18 anymore and certain volume levels bother me now but this was deafening!  So I shout out my order to the very arrogant and haughty register boy who was busy admiring the glossy paint on his nails.  

Apparently, they dont like non-meat eaters because they charged me .50 extra for my simple dollar menu burrito.  My only crime was asking for the meat to be replaced with beans.  It was also supposed to have 5 layers of sauce, cheese, etc, etc.  Mine roughly had 2 layers: one was beans one was cheese..........so I shouldve just ordered the bean and cheese right?  Why Im annoyed is because they were capable of messing up a simple, no-hassle order so royally.  I mean I just wanted a burrito for my hungry stomach (yes, and the fire sauce packets too)"}
{"text":"Too many commercials for these Nacho Fries...time to give them a try! I visited Taco Bell in the drive thru and only ordered the Nacho Fries. 

Quick visit and the drive thru line went quickly. I got home and cracked open the nacho cheese and dipped one of the fries. At first the fries reminded me of Red Robin fries but after a couple more, not as much seasoning. They were lightly seasoned and tasted good...but not great. Would I order them again? Yes, I think they would be a good snack with any combination of food from Taco Bell. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location is incredible! Especially because of the employees, Josh was incredible. He made my friends first Taco Bell experience so memorable. My boyfriend also has a cheese allergy and although an item was incorrect on our order Josh went above and beyond to correct it!"}
{"text":"68 minutes at drive thru six cars.  I counted.  Need I say more.  Well yell thinks so so again 68 minutes"}
{"text":"The absolute SLOWEST Taco Bell I've ever experienced! Don't be surprised if you spend 45+ minutes in the drive-thru (I wish I was kidding). The people are friendly once you do get up to the windows, but if I had $1 for every time I saw someone leave the line, I'd be a rich lady. I think they just need to hire more people for the nigh shifts, especially since it's one of the only fast food places open late in the area."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I wouldn't even give this place any stars. Can there last night and I understood the drive through is backed up. Came inside and ordered was I told that wait time to get my food is 10 mins. That's unheard off.!!! Anyhow, I placed an order and after 5 mins I decided to get my refund back. Im not sure how they hire the employees but my receipt clearly says what I payed for. The guy ended up refunding me back a different amount than what I payed for. Clearly he didn't have any math skills at all and I demanded to get back what I payed for! Worst Taco Bell service ever!!!"}
{"text":"I need to start out by saying I RARELY eat what I consider \"junk\" fast food but my husband craves it. We are both in the midst of studying for big exams for our work and my husband wanted junk food to fuel him. We went through the drive through. The service was friendly but it's was very hard to hear the girl over the speaker. Occasionally a guy would talk and it seemed like his headset or whatever worked MUCH better. When we got home one item was missing from the bag. We called and they were pleasant but said we had to come into the store for refund or replacement but could come another day. 

As far as the food - my husband said his crunch wrap was all lettuce with a tiny 
 bite of meat. His (much cheaper) tacos had far more meat. 

When I went back a few days later for the refund on the nacho bell grande they were pleasant but only offered to replace the item. I probably could've raised a stink but it's not worth the grief. 

The nachos were \"ok\" but I wouldn't order them again. We miss the Taco Bell of days past when the meat didn't seem like it was more fluff than protein and the nacho cheese wasn't mildly spiced yellow goo. Eh, but that's why we stopped coming here, we'd rather eat actual food than \"food like products\".

Oh and if you want Long John Silvers, much better deal to go to their other store. Here the coleslaw is pre-packaged and much smaller than you would get at a solely LJS location."}
{"text":"I only come here once in a while, but I have received great customer service each time. It feels like the employees enjoy their job and enjoy helping their customers...even if its for a simple order of tacos. :)"}
{"text":"1st experience with the breakfast menu and not impressed. Had the sausage, egg wrap.  Not a lot of flavor truly needed the hot sauce.  Probably not going back for breakfast..."}
{"text":"Well to begin with; a while ago (6 or 8 months) we got shorted on some chicken in a bucket for take-out. We complained and they gave us some sort of \"hey - we're sorry, we screwed up; here's a [name on a list credit] at the store. When we went in to redeem the credit, they took care of us without any problems, or so we thought. When we got home, we found 2 or 3 legs in our bucket were real old & kinda burnt. We phoned in our concern and never heard back from them. 3 weeks ago we decided that maybe the last experiences were flukes. WE WERE WRONG!!! Ordered the 10 piece leg/thigh bucket & fixin's. Got home to find 2 legs missing - AGAIN! Called KFC to complain and still have not heard from them or the store. We will not be darkening their door in the future!! Suggest you don't either...you have been warned."}
{"text":"I dont do Taco Bell very often, but when I do, it is a craving. So I got a dozen soft tacos....6 meat and cheese and all with no beans or sour cream. I ordered a Mexican Pizza....havent head for over a year...again, without refried beans and sour cream. I was asked \"no sour cream or beans\" and I agreed. The menu was correct. I got my order, drove home only to find beans on my Pizza....ahhhhh, never again. As a teacher, I dont have money to throw out the window, however, I literally did at Taco Bell!!"}
{"text":"The last three times that I have gone here, i have gone to the drive through and been asked to pull around. The first two times, I pulled around and both times my order was wrong or not complete and I had to go inside. The third time, when I pulled around, I just went inside (this defeats the purpose of the drive through) and, my order was missing items.

Service is slow and you just end up going inside anyways if you order at the drive through. I will not go to this Taco Bell anymore.  

If you go here, save yourself the trouble and just go inside."}
{"text":"Whack tacos. You live in Arizona, go get some real tacos. 

WATCHOUT for cars when leaving the drive through"}
{"text":"It's clean. It's relatively new. It's a good taco bell and you can sleep here if you want to"}
{"text":"Seriously I waited in the drive thru for like 10 minutes. Finally I actually called the store and asked if there was a problem. The manager was like no why? So I explained that we had all been sitting there for forever and I was trapped in the drive thru and couldn't get out and could he please start taking orders. His response was oh sorry I accidentally turned my headset off go ahead with your order. (I was 3 cars away).  Anyways I got my usual cantina bowl and it was okay... not great even by Taco Bell standards."}
{"text":"As I'm eating, I can hear the employees complaining about another employee and can hear, assuming the manager, yelling at the employees. Sitting at the other side of the restaurant and can hear them clear as day. Horrible location"}
{"text":"I came after work for a quick bite and that what I definitely received. When I went up to order I felt I was rush. I know the chips and cheese are on the value menu  but I think I five chips and less then half a cup of cheese was less then value and more a sample."}
{"text":"The craving for a chalupa and that orange citrus kickstart drink was so real so I decided to drive down to Tacobell. The girl at the drive through was upbeat and their service was fast. Another fast food less than one mile from my house. Food was prepared to my liking. 

Another reason I come to Tacobell is because they provide a raffle entry code with every purchase. My bf won his PS4 from them last year. Hopefully ill get lucky this time!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell and I go way back.  It is not the greatest food by far, but at 2:00 in the morning after a hard night out, there are times I would kill for some nachos.  

This location in particular stays open until 3, so I have a good hour after last call to make it.  And it is walking distance from my apartment so that makes me extra happy.  During the recent remodeling, the drive thru stayed open every time I had a need.  And for that, I give 3 stars."}
{"text":"First off this place is getting five stars mostly based off customer service from my last two years in vegas. Obviously after coming here frequently for those 2 years not all my meals were perfect and I've had typical fast food issues like messed up orders or messy tacos or whatever but it's expected from all fast food but all issues here were handled greatly. Idk if it's because Every time I ordered my drink I said bah-jah but they always recognized me and were happy to see me which made my visits nice wether I was getting off work or drunk at 1am. They have some really
Great people working there and I hope they are all fortunate to move on to bigger and better things, restaurant can be cold if you dine in and bathroom had no mirror which are the things I noticed. Some new guys working there seem zoned out but they perform the job adequately. All in all please continue to serve fellow military members with the same service I got and people will love this store as I came too. Lastly I hate this place because I gained like 10 pounds eating here haha"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is HORRIBLE. I love Taco Bell. This is the closest one to where I live, so its easy. But I don't think i've come here and had my order right a single time, and I come often. I swear the workers here just throw random stuff into a bag and hand it to you hoping you'll leave. If you go here, go inside and order and check your bag before you leave, because chances are, your order is wrong."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Taco Bell, and I only came here for that once in a while craving but I'm giving this Taco Bell 5 stars only for the fact that one of the workers, Brittney, deserves the recognition. She was such a sweetheart and it's hard finding that now a days. Coming across people that can stay in a bubbly mood at 2am even after a long shift definitely says something about that person's character. Such a genuine person and if you have the opportunity to be served by her, consider yourself lucky!"}
{"text":"These people are always THE nicest EVER!! Tonight specifically it was Dante. Thank you for just being a kind human!!"}
{"text":"Usually the best but today they closed early and I took a Uber here just to get me some taco smell. Rude. Stay open until your scheduled time. Thanks bye"}
{"text":"Expect to spend at least 20 min in the drive through at all hours. Its almost midnight and Ive been sitting in the drive through for 11 minutes now and have not even ordered."}
{"text":"Food was not made according to the order.  I called to mention this to the manager and she said that it was made correctly, so what was my problem?  I was not angry when I called but her rudeness and complete lack of customer service skills changed that.  After a few minutes of her asking me repeatedly what my problem was and arguing every single thing I said, I told her we would not be visiting this location again and she cheerfully replied Okay, no problem and hung up.  So rude."}
{"text":"Yes, sometimes I live three lifetimes waiting in the drive-thru because of the slow service, but the employees are always so friendly and endearing that it makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Hungover and want some instant gratification?  Taco bell is your place to go.  Though the next day might not far too well for you.  This location hasn't effed my order yet and hook  me up with enough diablo sauce that I have a drawer in my kitchen dedicated to just taco bell sauce.  Kudos to you Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. You know exactly what you are going to get...sick later."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell, located in the Arboretum next to the movie theater, on the Providence Road side of the shopping center, is great if you desire a run to the border.  Built a few years ago at the location where the original Taco Bell from my high school days was torched, it serves as one of three drive-thru fast food joints in the Arboretum.  In several visits to the drive-thru at varying times of day/night, my orders have always been correct (my no-tomato request has always been honored) and delivered quickly.  (Taco Bell,  which is owned by Yum! Brands, which is a spinoff from PepsiCo, serves Pepsi Products - be prepared)."}
{"text":"Smallest amount of meat I have ever seen in a taco from Taco Bell or anywhere really it was less that 1 bite of meat but he told me this is standard across the country."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell so far and i've been enjoying Taco Bell since the 90's.   Came for breakfast.  It was fresh, yummy, and excellent service.  Thank You!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST Taco Bell ever with the WORST employees ever. I came up and ordered a chicken quesadilla and they \"were out of chicken.\" So then I ordered a potato burrito and they were \"out of potatoes.\" Finally I asked for some tacos and a beef burrito and apparently \"they didn't have enough beef for the order. I also asked for two Fiery Doritos tacos and the guy mocked the way I pronounced the word \"fiery.\" And I am a very nice person who has worked customer service before so I'm very patient and understanding but this was just ridiculous. If you're not going to have any food to sell then why stay open? I also found a hair once in my food but decided to give them another shot. AVOID."}
{"text":"Cody Adams is the man!!! Thank you P! He was super nice, fast and amazing! Thank you thank you thank you buddy"}
{"text":"If I could give this Taco Bell location no stars I would. Ive given this location many of chances time and time again. Every time I go to this location they are either out of something, my order is accurate, my food is cold or I'm waiting 30 minutes plus to get some tacos. Last night was the final straw for me when I ordered my food and requested no beans and the lady proceeds to tell me beans don't come on what I order, but I order the same thing every time?? Pay for our food and get to the window and the younger girl taking orders has her cellphone plugged in the wall by the cash register and as she is taking orders she has her phone in her hand gabbing to the so called manager Ana. No wonder my order was wrong. Why are your employees allowed on their phones while working??? Why is it that the most germ ridden device in your hand while taking food orders and packaging them?? I go into the restaurant after I realized my order was incorrect as I knew it would be because it always happens at this location. The so called manager Ana then proceeds to cop an attitude with my boyfriend and I exclaiming that that was what we ordered. She reprints my receipt showing me that, that was in fact what I ordered. Yelling at me and telling me no this is what you ordered you didn't proofread what we rang up, because it's my job to check you on your job? Hello no. I told her I don't care what your receipt says that's not what I ordered you rang my entire order wrong because your cashier is on her phone not listening to anything any of the PAYING CUSTOMERS are saying. But these are the same whine babies that want $15 an hour to make some tacos?? This location has lost my business. I have contacted corporate and will be contacting them again later today."}
{"text":"Oh taco bell, I know it's bad for me but I want it and just cannot control myself when it comes to salty, high calorie perhaps not 100% beef goodness Taco Bell is where I indulge on fast food. 

This structure was previously a BP gas station that was converted into a Taco Bell. The inside is still convenience store sized I think there are less then ten tables in this location, and there are awkward high tops in he middle of the dinning area.   With that being said I think it would be best to take your food to go.  Any who the tacos are good here and so are the Mexican pizza and bonus Taco Bell has all you can drink fountain drinks, which I am sure you are all aware of."}
{"text":"It's hard to give a fast food place more than Three Stars, or A-Ok in Yelp-ese. 

But if I could, this Taco Bell would be Three a half Stars!

The staff is very friendly and accessible, as is the franchisee who seems to be everywhere overseeing his business.  Nice!   When was the last time you were met and greeted by the restaurant owner?

It's been nearly thirty years since I had my first taco, and like Glenn Bell I fell in love with this quasi Mexican food item. His invention of the hard shell taco was a game changer. The new healthier menu is major a improvement.  The salads are much better

This restaurant is brand new.  Some seats even have cushions.  WOW!  They have some minor kinks to workout, such as the Pepsi all in one soda dispenser.  Like the Coke version, it makes everything taste like Dr Pepper.  So, if you are on the run for a quick taco or burrito, Taco Bell is still the place

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As I've mentioned in my Yelp Tip -- they may be slow at times, but they excel at getting the order right!

This Taco Bell opened about five years ago and can be occasionaly slow.  But I'll take slower service every time, if they get the order correct.  It's not rocket science. But for some reason over the years fast food places started focusing on the fast element. At the expense of the experience.

Yeah, I know this is minor stuff.  But how many of us have left a drive-thru window, gotten all the way home and found someone else order in the bag?  Or, an order just totally wrong? Since we do not live nearby, the idea of driving all the way back... well just frosts me.

So don't honk.  Don't get impatient.  Just enjoy the view of the tail lights in front of you, knowing that this is a safe place that you won't have to revisit in fifteen minutes.  BTW, the inside is very modern and immaculate. So, Three Stars \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"Well I can't eat great cause they aren't open late.Why post hours if the employees don't follow them , went there at 10 and there closed employees were just staring at me through the window maybe it's time to hire people that actually want to work instead of the slackers that work here."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened to this taco bell over the past few months but it has gone downhill. Understaffed, always out of stuff, tried to go play night and they were closed at 10pm. It didn't use to be like this. New management?"}
{"text":"If you get the dbl chalupa box order it online otherwise they gouge you for an extra dollar."}
{"text":"Horrible! I've been living in the neighborhood for 15 years and have unfortunately ordered at this KFC dozens of times. I can't think of a single time where something wasn't wrong with the orders. They manage to screw up anything! The employees are usually impolite and/or grumpy, and the chicken is rubbery and slimy. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! From the moment my husband and i walked in they were amazing! Thank you all for a great experience we will be back!"}
{"text":"Been waiting in the drive thru for 40 minutes. Gave us the wrong order. Three times. No apology. TERRIBLE service. WORST location I've ever been to. Customers in the lobby also have been waiting for a very very long time with messed up orders. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!! I have a severe dairy allergy and every time i've ordered food here (both in person and through the app) i've gotten home and discovered my food COVERED in cheese, sour cream, and sauce, even though i've ordered it \"fresco\" style and emphasized that my food not have dairy products. there was even shreds of cheese in the guacamole i got with chips. yes, i understand there can be issues when ordering without certain ingredients (especially at a fast food chain), but taco bell prides itself and boasts about how \"friendly\" they are with this (and even have a term in the system for it) and can't seem to not ruin my food every time. 

people i've gone with who order straight off the menu have been underwhelmed by this location. food is many times cold and flavorless. and my vegetarian friend received a burrito inside a tortilla that was covered in dried meat, so she couldn't eat either.

the people who work here have seemed very nice, but they need to pay closer attention to customers orders."}
{"text":"Went in again last night, no one was there to serve me for 5 minutes.......5 minutes!!!! When I did get my order, as I sat in the lobby, I heard the cooks/supervisor cursing AGAIN, thank God I don't have children or I would be really really angry. They shout curse words at each other and also, AGAIN I hear racism. Seriously? Seriously? ................where is the owner!? I am reporting this to corporate."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Taco Bell ever! If you can get past the parking lot/Mobil Station transplants, it should be easy. It's not. So slow you could take at least 3 power naps before you get your order. Speaking of power ... When I order a Chicken Power Menu Salad I want Chicken in it or I would have ordered the Veggie! You're all gonna have to work a bit harder than that to convince me you should make $15 an hour. That's it, this location just keeps getting worse. One star, only because I can't give it a zero."}
{"text":"Went here like a month ago, last time I ever will. So after standing at the counter for 5-10 minutes being completely unacknowledged by the staff to the point I'm wondering if I've died and become a ghost, some guy takes my order and then gives me my card and turns right around and takes off before I've even put it back in my wallet without giving me my cup. 

The food comes out quickly and then as I'm double checking to see if they got the order right that person leaves without giving me my cup too, so I stand there a couple more minutes before I'm acknowledged, and finally get my cup and find they don't even have any lids for them.

It's not that they were even busy or anything, there were at least 3 staffers there and none of the 2 other people inside the restaurant at the time needed anything, so the only people they had to service other than myself were 2 cars at the drive through.

Some of the worst service I've ever seen. If you have to go to a Taco Bell, this one's not a good one to go to, unfortunately."}
{"text":"It's weird to review a fast food place, but I just have to cuz I couldn't believe how terrible my service was. First of all, there was only 2 cars ahead of me, but I sat there for 15 min waiting. When I finally got up there, the cashier was obviously fighting with another employee, so this little scrawny kid goes and he literally yells \"yeah, no shit bro! Don't come at me like that, you don't know who you're talking to.\" All while taking my card and giving me my food. At some point he remembered he was working and asked me if I wanted any sauce. Besides that, didn't give me a hello or goodbye, just kept fighting with this other employee. Wow....just wow."}
{"text":"Used to stop going here because of drive through orders were always messed up, glad to see they fixed It and the crunch wrap supremes and and beefy 5 layers burritos were made perfectly!! Very pleased!!"}
{"text":"2 cars back and 16 minutes in drive thru and this isn't the first time that they've taken forever. Never going back  I don't expect great service at Taco Bell but there's no reason to take that long. What it comes down to is this Taco Bell management are broken cheapskates on labor."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell use to get you in and out with the quickness. I've been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks and it takes 10-15 mins to get your order. The girl says they don't have enough ppl but with minimum-wage being so high you think people would be flocking to these jobs. It's faster to go to another TB than this one."}
{"text":"Every Time they mess up the order! EVERY time!! This time I called back and 'one of the managers on' CYNTHIA said I had to wait in the drive thru line again!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place.. the lady up front named moe is so nice.. my daughter and I enjoy coming in after school for happy hour specials"}
{"text":"Shitty service, no one even smiled at me. Took ten min just for two crunchy tacos. No napkins ANYWHERE in the building, not even paper towels in the bathroom-- ironically enough my friend got cheese all over herself (lol). Rude staff. Messy dining room. You get the point: this Taco Bell suckkkkkkksssss. This visit reminded me why I don't come to Taco Bell anymore"}
{"text":"First off, when we walked in the it was 10:56, I kid you not. The menu board was still showing breakfast. We asked if they were serving lunch items and the cashier said yes. So we asked her if she can turn the menu boards over so we can see the lunch menu and she told us we had to wait until 11! Remind you it is now 10:58. So my husband and I order our food. Literally the second we finished ordering and paying for our food, the lady with glasses began to change the menu! My husband and I were taken by surprise! So we decide to eat our food in the car because it was freezing inside. By the time I open up my chipotle chicken griller, it was flat! No chicken barely any sauce! Attached is the actual photo of my supposedly chicken griller. Bad customer service and horrible food here at this location!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.  They have tacos.  And burritos.  *shrug*

This Bell has a super small parking lot and a turning radius into the drive-thru that you need to pay attention to, lest you swipe a vehicle or fence with your bumper.  I only go through the drive-thru as parking might mean you are there for a while, since the drive-thru line goes directly through the only row of parking.  Once you are in the lot, there is nowhere to turn around, so you had best have a game plan already in place.

Standard Taco Bell fare, I am a big fan of the $5 special boxes so I have a variety of items and I can eat what I want and throw the rest away.  It comes with 3 various menu items (usually a regular taco, some sort of burrito and some sort of specialty item like the Dorito taco or a chalupa).  The caramel apple empanadas are quite good (apple pie filling in a fried shell) and the cinnamon twists make for a light sweet treat.

My order is generally correct when going through the drive thru, the health score is consistently in the high 90's and the staff is always pleasant.  It's A-OK for drive-thru fast food for a quick lunch on a busy workday."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than making a smile request and it go completely ignored. No one likes Chalupas with the Chalupa bread tough to eat because it's Ben sitting for s long time. Service from this chain has been on a decline. May have to just find somewhere else. Very dissatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff at this place continues to change but that is the only thing you wait so long to get your order when you get a incorrect as always you just take it an leave this happens over and over and over"}
{"text":"great location, in the parking lot of the Pineville mall.  You cannot access this store from the street.  You have to enter the mall property.
The guys working the drive thru were funny.  They got my order wrong and gave back the wrong change, but it was like they were acting together as a comedy skit to make things better.  I appreciated that.  They weren't taking things too serious.
All in all, the same food you would expect from each of your visits to a Taco Smell.  What makes the difference is the people, and these folks shined."}
{"text":"Drive thru is always quick this time of night and staff is always super friendly. dunno about later haha! Food takes a minute which actually like :D means it isn't just sitting and is fresh. Had the crunch wrap supreme tonight which is so awesome and tasty and fun. Buuuut will ask for no nacho cheese sauce next time because boy is it yucky. Tastes like vomit, seriously! Eeeew. Also had a chicken quesadilla which was eh. Ive had better from taco bell before. Potatoe soft taco was fantastico my last visit. Will visit again im sure. Gotta try the diablo sauce and quesarito"}
{"text":"By far the slowest service drive thru in Streetsboro. I could have easily went to a sit down Mexican restaurant and been served quicker. Half an hour later and still at the window waiting on my food. Would have left a lot earlier but at a certain point you say \" well I waited this long\". They need to get this place fixed!"}
{"text":"Slow and disinterested service by indifferent employees. Not a good experience. Has kind of turned me off to Taco Bell. 

I was the only customer. Took about 15 minutes to order a combo meal. When I opened it, it wasn't even hot.

I didn't bother complaining. I just tossed it in the trash and walked out. 

If I had the option for zero stars, this would be a zero star review."}
{"text":"The night shift at this store was very impressive. The young man at the register was personable, professional, helpful and gave an excellent greeting. I have had many interactions with the night shift manager in the past. He sometimes will work the drive thru window. He has always been fantastic. The lady preparing the food was very nice and personable. She thanked me for my business as she handed me the food. Her wonderful smile was absolutely contagious. I must truly say this was probably my single best fast food experience."}
{"text":"Ordered curly fries, jumbo jack and tacos.   EVERYTHING tasted bitter.   Not sure if the oil they used had gone bad or what.   Definitely disappointed.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Was obviously craving Taco Bell after not eating meat for a whole month Lol! Late night around 11 we went here spontaneously and was helped by 
ERA!! She was and idk even know to say this, the most helpful Taco Bell employee ever!!! 
We ordered 3 soft shell taco supremes with diablo sauce and I was in the mood for a blue raspberry freeze- poppin candy of course.
What ERA does went above and beyond my expectations was that with the popping candy- she put it on the bottom, the middle and the top! 
Made my dinner so memorable and delicious and the sour blue raspberry def washed away the oily saltiness of the taco meat. 
Regardless, Taco Bell is delicious (despite what anyone says) and will always be my fast food food of choice but thanks to ERA I will always remember this meal and not only that she was super friendly and as described before beyond helpful!"}
{"text":"Chris is seriously the best fast food worker I have ever met. He is the sweetest, hardest, most honest worker I have ever seen. Give this man a promotion! I go to Taco Bell, a lot, this is by far the best made food as well. But Chris... seriously promote him."}
{"text":"To put it simply Taco Bell is the BOMB. 

No not every Taco Bell is created equal. This Taco Bell out Waterworks Mall is superior to all others in the region. That my be an exaggeration but hey that's how I feel.

So many fond memories with my family and friends eating at this Taco Bell. No trip to Waterfront is complete with out eating here first. 


The restaurant is kept clean, the foods comes out quick and they are not skimpy on the taco fillings and plus they serve some menu items from Pizza Hut, that's a plus in my book."}
{"text":"This place is slow been at the window for 20 minutes waiting for anyone to say anything and when they did they took another 5 minutes to get my food.  Horrible service"}
{"text":"Writing this review while waiting on food that I ordered 25 mins ago and currently watching the employees scream to the customers if anyone wants a refund because they're taking to long. We have been in here almost 30 mins and nobody not only us, has got there food yet. Some of the employees keep look at each other laughing about the fact that people are getting upset. There's no line in drive through and maybe 10 people in the dining room, and that's it. The dining room is also disgusting, and customers are having to clean the booths themselves. Will NOT return. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"Been in the drive thru with only three cars in front of me for no kidding 30 minutes and counting. I've been waiting so long I've logged onto Yelp for the first time ever to write this review, meanwhile my fiancé has been waiting for me to pick him up for this long, and there's no exit"}
{"text":"The fiod was fine they do not provide a senior drink. The senior drink is the only reason i patronize taco bells of las gegasmeach and every day. I create a list on my phone of those who stopped. The record i do not stop. I encourage others to do the same"}
{"text":"Ots alright but no senior drink. Ao incant come here no more. I suggest going to a different taco bell leave this one alone"}
{"text":"Stay golden Taco Bell. You guys are always great.

I come here all hours of the day and night and I always get quality. And the drunks are hilarious."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! Usually places like this aren't the best but I was surprised at how well the employees greeted me, assisted me, and thanked me"}
{"text":"Food is okay, what can you expect its taco bell and its fast food. The environment inside is something else. Its not clean their is trash on the floor and homeless people just relaxing inside i would not say its the best place if you just want to stop by and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Old design taco bell gives you that circus clown in a car feeling"}
{"text":"Drive through order.... nacho bellgrande combo and a taco....got a side of jalapeños.... had shreds of cheese in it.... made me wonder about the other items and stuff I can't see.... service is always s very friendly here but the quality is consistently lacking... I've had missing toppings before, and skimpy items... tonight I saw a kid carrying the ice bucket by putting his bare elbow  in the bucket and carrying it by extending his arm.... may be hard to picture but the point is bare skin in the bucket where the ice goes... that's gross and it's gotta be a health code violation.... better to go to somewhere else to satisfy the  cheap taco craving than to risk getting sick...that'll be my last trip to this location.... just gave it two stars cause the kids working there are always very polite and friendly..."}
{"text":"Balise (B)  gave outstanding an exceptional customer service and is clearly an asset to Taco Bell and will be an asset wherever she goes her future is bright!, Thank you B for making my day. I gave a four star review instead of a five star review because everything that I ordered I ordered without meat and there was meat in one of the items and I know that it was not B's error because I saw the order on the screen.  I know mistakes happen but I wish they would've paid more attention."}
{"text":"They are supposed to close at 2 am however when I came before that time I was told they already started to break things down and was closed for the night. If you close at 2 then close at 2 not before. I was really irritated by that."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today. The person taking orders at the window was very pleasant. Other than not receiving any napkins or a fork my food was great"}
{"text":"While the staff is very friendly and made the order correctly. The value is just not there. Paid $18 for 2 very below average meals. 
The setting: don't dine in (or eat here at all), because every table and seat is dirty, making it a comfortable setting for bugs to dine in there as well (see photos). This place is in dire need of a remodel."}
{"text":"As stated by the other yelpers... Worst Taco Bell ever. Drive threw takes forever... I order on the Taco Bell app, the women on the speaker confirmed my order. When I got to the pick up window, they hadn't even made my food yet. The very unprofessional young man was making comments to the people preparing my food \"she's mad, hurry up\" while the cooks were complaining they didn't see the order... The food was sloppy and one of my tacos had almost no meat in it. Thankfully this isn't my normal Taco Bell, I never have to come to this location again. I never have this problem on 3rd st! The only reason I resorted to a Yelp review is because I didn't get my receipt or a comment card. Coincidentally, my husband had come through the drive threw a few hours earlier, he got one."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! Every time i go there, there is about a 20 minute wait in the drive thru and every single time they mess up my order! One night i went back THREE times cause they messed up my food and forgot stuff! They are always rude and the computer is always down! Sucks when its 330 am when i get off work and its rhe only place open and its always messed up! Horrible"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks ass. ALLLLL I asked for was 5 soft tacos and nachos HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU FORGET TO GIVE ME MY CHEESE TO MY NACHOS????? I've always had problems with this location. I should had known not to even go back. I don't get how you forget to add the cheese to the nachos??? And my order was soooooooo simple! I couldn't be more frustrated."}
{"text":"Came in last night and the manager Liz had an attitude when I came back through. She was working window. I said I had just ordered and she cut me off and said \"well remake it pull forward.\" in a rush with attitude. So I start moving forward then I was like wait and backed up \"Do you want me to tell you what the problem with the order was?\" She then rudely said, \"you wanted no sour cream right, we're making it withOUT sour cream.\" I said,\"no that's not the problem, there's nothing in this burrito (empty).\" She then acted confused and pissed off so I pulled forward and showed her the burrito. I asked for her name and she confirmed she was the manager, all her bad attitude gone and now that she gave her name and now she's talking in a whining butt hurt voice like a child who's bad behavior wasn't working. Showed her the burrito and got my money back. When she tried to shove the new burrito in my car and I said, \"no thanks\" several times and she got pissed again. (Picture attached)"}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru last night we got there at 11:15, whomever was working the window served the car in front of us, ( mind you all the lights in the drive thru were on and the board was all lite up. We pull up to place our order and waited...and waited for 5 minutes and no one came on to take our order. Finally we pulled up to the window and we see the employees all in the back , looks like they were having a good old time. Needless to say they lost a customer last night. Kind of sad for a Taco Bell, that shows on here they are open until midnight."}
{"text":"Food was good honestly however i was kicked out for wearing my jacket hood over my head. Felt the lady didnt care for other races..... I'm going to add to this I called the corporate office they called me back and they were very apologetic and also said there is no corporate regulation against wearing your hood or your hoodie. Again the food was very fresh very good I felt the attendant didn't really appreciate me and I thought it might have something to do with my ethnicity."}
{"text":"Asked for two separate orders and the manager denied and was not even customer service friendly worried about her timing and talking to her coworkers than leaving her customers happy. Next time I suggest taking care of a customer and not being rude rosa."}
{"text":"Great service. Smiles often and quick to get food. Didn't give me mild sauce like I asked. And also didn't give me extra sour cream"}
{"text":"The screen here showed my order in full. As I was driving away I check my bags. I had to come back through the drive-through in a taxi only to have the night manager's employee tell me that the night manager actually deleted part of my order on purpose. I was told not to worry because I wasn't charged but I wanted the item that I was asking for.

So while in a taxi I had to go back through the drive-through again to do all of this. The window operator keep apologizing stating that the manager had deleted the order and actually stepped out of the way and force the manager to talk to me. I asked the night manager why he deleted my order and they couldn't tell me. Then he slammed the order went out in my face from the taxi when I suggested that he should give me my nachos and cheese for free.

I got out and not firmly on the door and then the manager sent another employee to answer the window with my order in full. I offered to pay for the order after the manager said that I would have to even though he delete it off and then he gave it to me for free- by sending another employee to the window now involving three employees. This employee by which came to the window with a fighting stance! I would highly suggest that the manager of this location review the footage from their cameras. Because something is going on at this location and the night manager should be fired.

The way I see it is this manager is untrained in customer service or how to deal with issues- and should probably be sent back to high school to learn basic grammar is \"no bro\" it's not a part of a normal conversation in a customer and transaction especially for food. In fact his entire dialects states that they're obviously not up to par with industry standards for management."}
{"text":"Nothing is more frustrating than when you get home and open your taco bell bag and there isn't any sauce in the bag!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing this specific location and not the chain in general.  Really, do not waste your time going here and just go to another location for your Taco Bell needs.  

As any TB frequenter knows, there are some of those visits during off peak hours where they have their JV folders on duty and the result is your food is just not put together well.  This location seems to only hire JV folders.  

Another thing that is upsetting about this location is that their rate of getting orders correct is at best 1 in 4.  They constantly put beef on my bean burritos and put onions on the 7 layers.  

If you enjoy interaction with crack heads, then this place is for you.  I have gotten harassed by other patrons who just yelled random comments at us, and this was during the day.  Also, one of the workers was definitely under the influence during one visit.  

Just drive the extra 3 minutes and go to another location."}
{"text":"Went here to grab food. Paid with 100 bill. It was an old bill, 1983 in fact. The drive thru guy took it in the back n came back to tell me his manager said it was fake n is confiscating it. I was in disbelief. I don't use fake money. I asked for proof that it was fake. I went inside and manager said there is no proof. She says her machine will not take fake bills. I asked for the pen, she said they don't use the pen...only the machine. She had no proof but yet was gonna keep my $100. She treated me like shit and she was a complete bitch! I got the bank involved, they sent a clerk to taco bell with a device for counterfeit money......( bcuz that's where this bill came from) low and behold.....THE SHIT WAS REAL!!!  Glad I followed up w the bank n refused her explanaition or this bitch would have had an extra $100 in her lowlife pocket. Buyer beware using cash at this taco bell"}
{"text":"Prompt but the soda is always off tasting. The parking lot smells like sewer gas which can be a definite turn off. Employees are nice."}
{"text":"Really Taco Bell???? I ordered a ton of food and asked for hot and mild sauce, just got a little mild. Then, my food is half assed made. My Mexican pizza is a joke. Horrible service and horrible food."}
{"text":"I will not be returning here went through the drive thru asked for a  12 pk and they would NOT mix it up with soft tacos hard tacos and burritos even though on the menu it says you can do so I also added for cheesy potato Rito's and was charged $26 for that after looking at the receipt the lady at the window who seemed to be the manager charged me $11 for $1 burritos and when inquiring about the 12 pack there was a girl with tattoos on her Chicago down or arm to be exact that just wanted to give dirty looks the whole time I will not be coming back and I will be getting ahold of corporate with the customer service and overcharged this Taco Bell can never get anything right and has the shittiest customer service"}
{"text":"I love this location.  The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason."}
{"text":"Absolute slowest fast food location of any fast food restaurant known to man.  Every time...so slow!"}
{"text":"this is the worst taco bell ever do not patronize i sat blocked in their drive thru last night for 40 min after repeating my order 6x to the cashier who obviously didn't care about any customers who has to repeat 6x....then i finally get to the window and my large order isn't ready yet so i asked for a manager was told he went outside i cancelled my order drove around the building to find a manager smoking a cigarette while talking on his cellphone...seriously my money spends anywhere and it won't be here"}
{"text":"I am extremely lactose intolerant so I ordered my food with no cheese or sour cream I also don't eat meat so I ordered a veggie burrito there was cheese in one of my burritos and when I opened the other the tortilla was completely broken and beans are showing through I'm afraid to even eat the other burrito because Im scared cheese may be inside. I will be driving further (this one is very close to home) next time I have a Taco Bell craving.
I would like to add that 5 months later my brother ordered me a bean burrito no cheese and once again they put cheese on it then when he tried to call the phone rang and rang and rang and they never picked up."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has the best drive thru attendant I have dealt with in awhile. C'mon is Taco Bell, so not much to write about... But this specific time my 2 min experience was enhanced by the person behind the speakers. Come to find out she also has the biggest smile. This young lady wears braces and I only hope management can recognize who I'm referring to so they can try to duplicate this kind of service and keep their talent."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the drive thru and get home , something is missing.Its time I quit going there,  The chips were missing, and I called and she laughed and said that happens all the time. What is wrong with these people when they take your order. Seems like they could care less. The money that I spent and didnt get should be taken out of their pay. Bet they would be more careful."}
{"text":"Two popular YUM! Food brands under one roof. Located near the intersection of Bloor and Yonge Streets, this small, yet convenient Taco Bell location serves it purpose well, providing fast food to those craving it. Located across the street from both Spring Rolls and McDonald's,  this intersection is bustling with numerous dining options for those craving burgers, pizza, Tex Mex food,etc. The menus are somewhat limited therefore, ordering a traditional bucket of chicken or items from Taco Bell's value menu don't appear."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of College Park's concourse level (across from Metro supermarket and close to the College Street subway station), this joint Taco Bell/KFC franchise serves traditional chicken and Tex Mex dishes commonly found at other KFC/Taco Bell locations.  Busy during weekdays, when the lunch crowd that works in the building congregates for lunch, the place tends to get slow on weekends.  Nothing really special about the food, but it should satisfy the fast food cravings of those seeking KFC/Taco Bell's menu selections."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell what can you say. Food is just as good as everywhere else. But what makes this Taco Bell awesome is the drive-through attendant. He is amazing! His personality, his demeanor, his excitement, and manners make for such a pleasant experience. His name is Patrick(fluffy hair, glasses) and he deserves a raise. I don't think I have ever had such a positive experience in the Drive-Thru. What a great guy!"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice low-carb lunch? The Power Bowls help me from getting bored eating the same thing all the time. The workers were very accommodating with my substitutions (no rice or beans, add extra chicken and nacho cheese). It was delicious! Will eat again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing visit.  Granted we went at 12 midnight, completely sober, mind you, that shouldnt mean customers of that hour should get jipped.  We ordered a steak quesadilla, 1 hard 1 soft taco, and a 7 layer burrito. All were jipped on fillings! The tacos had maybe a half inch of combined fillings, the 7 layer burrito has definitely shrunk in size and filling is just as poor. The only great thing about it was the nice drive through gal and the plentiful amount of sauces they gave us! love the verde!!"}
{"text":"There never open when they are supposed to be. The sign says opens at 7am I got there at 7:10 go thru the drive thru no body answers so I go to door it's locked. I called the store an the employee answers the phone and say we open at 7 am sir. I tell her but I was just there at 7:10 and no answer at the drive thru and the door was still locked."}
{"text":"The drive through line was very busy since there were likr 5 cars in front of me. But I only waited like 1 minute and the employee was SUPER friendly. I could tell when I got to the window why it had been so fast, the emplpyee was totally compitent and fast, all while being super polite and very friendly. The kind of employee that makes you feel valued as a customer. My order was correct, the food tatsed good. 5 Star Experience all around."}
{"text":"At one point in late 2009, I was going to this location at least twice a week for a month. It was not good for my wallet or my health, but my taste buds were not complaining. 

This Taco Bell has great customer service. The employees work really hard to get your food out to you in a timely manner. I get out of here so quick via drive-thru that I don't even remember paying sometimes.

I always order off of their value menu. The Frutista Freeze slushies taste really, really good.

This location is awesome!"}
{"text":"Let's just cut right to the chase about this particular location because let's be honest, we all know exactly the kind of food we are getting when we run for the border. 

This location is SLOOOOOOOW. Do not go here during any type of \"rush\" hour. Lunch, dinner, etc. 

I placed an order and waited 35 minutes until my food came out. Thirty five minutes! This isn't just unacceptable, it is downright lunacy. They were also apathetic to the entire situation. No sorry, no thanks for waiting. Nothing. Complete joke."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night and were both sick today. We've spent most of our day in our he bathroom hunched over the toilet the manager did tell me last night that I couldn't order a few things because the freezer was broken. She said what I ordered was ok. Man, I wish we would have left and gone somewhere else. 

On a few occasion, we've waited in the drive thru what seemed like forever. This has happened numerous times and your stuck if there's a car behind you. We've also gotten wrong orders and missing items. We've gone back and they treat it as we're lying or it couldn't have happened. 

If theres food poisoning to be had, I'll get it. I even told that to the manager and she laughed it off. 

We will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS STORE AGAIN. We will go out of our way to another one if we need to go to Taco Bell. Shame on them for running a store like this. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell!  The late night munchie masters.  This place has this meal segment locked down!  You can never go wrong after a night of heavy drinking.  They have these new menu items that are like a crunch wrap but they are only $1.00.  Sweet price and all kinds of warm and melty cheesy gooiness."}
{"text":"Great spot. I like their Doritos locos taco and they have really good flavorful food. The people that work there are nice. They got my order right and the food was fresh. I didn't wait a long time. I recommend and I found a good place that is not a burger joint."}
{"text":"What can I say. Seems everyone I'm over on Springfield Ave and hungry I stop here.  
Convenient and fair price. 
Can't beat just a hard shell taco. 
Service is always friendly. Drive up can be slow. But food is warm and fresh. 
Got the cinnamon bites this time too. They weren't that great but I didn't stop eating them."}
{"text":"Best drive thru service EVER!! Especially if your being served by Fredrick. Made my day, thanks for the smiles man!"}
{"text":"Glad this place is open late when I do work late. Quick easy pickup for dinner when I don't wish to make anything at home at 11pm."}
{"text":"Went to Taco Bell for a quick, easy meal and we went through the drive thru. The lady was really nice and they got our order quickly.. But it was wrong. They left out two of our items and two of our other items were wrong. We asked for no sour cream and it was on the receipt that we requested that and yet we still got sour cream on the soft tacos. So we drove back, complained and got the two items replaced that were wrong and actually got the items they left out. Got home. Opened one of them and there was a hair inside the taco. 

Really?"}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell in champaign/Urbana. The drive thru quality is always good. Never have had a bad drive thru experience. Food is great quality for a Taco Bell compared to Neil street by bed bath and beyond, the Taco Bell also on Neil street by steak and shake, and the Taco Bell by carle hospital. For some reason, this Taco Bell food is \"fresher\" if that makes any sense. 

The interior is the worst however. It's terrible bright white lights, every chair and table is cemented and it's all 2 seaters! Can't have 4 people hanging out eating some T Bell."}
{"text":"2nd best in Champaign, indoor is the nicest but have had suspect orders going through drive thru. 

1. Springfield Taco Bell
2. Taco Bell by st. Mary's and Kirby on Neil.
3. Taco Bell by carle hospital.
4. Taco Bell by Olive Garden and McDonald's. That one is the worst."}
{"text":"Please note, the hours listed here on Yelp are incorrect. Their posted hours start at 7am daily....and that is part of the problem. They never actually open at 7!.... They are consistently late in opening for breakfast. It must be nearly every day because I have been maybe 4 or 5 times in the last few months, well after 7am, where they are still not open. Only in one case were they kind enough to open the drive thru window to laugh it off and say it would be closer to 7:15 (at 7:05). Had a great breakfast at Panera that morning. Other times it was after 7:20 and they STILL were not open. I really hope the franchisee reads this and makes corrections, likely in personnel. There are many options in the Arboretum for a fast breakfast, and all of those open on time. Amazing."}
{"text":"Came in to Taco Bell looking for a nice night out on the town! I had two coupons in my hand, typically I take food to-go but since I had the company and the extra time, I was looking forward to dining in.  Upon arriving, I noticed a persistent, sharp smell.  I ignored the smell hoping it was temporary.  After finding my table and conferring with my guests we had all noticed the smell and agreed dining in would not be the experience we were looking for.  Same great quality taste unfortunately, this is somewhere you'll want to take to-go."}
{"text":"Nice store with good management. They may forget a taco or two but have always made up for it on the next visit. The Firey Tacos are high on my list right now."}
{"text":"Just left this store. Unable to even enter Taco Bell. The front doors were locked although the hours say 7am-10pm for dine in and there were no special signs. 

I saw trash on one of the tables so I looked through the windows to see if anyone was working. One employee looked at me, smiled and walked away. Another employee came out in between the doors and just shook his head no at me and walked back inside the store. 

At least have the courtesy, as an employee of an establishment, to come outside and explain why you will not serve us. 

Just piss poor management. I go to taco once every few months and know exactly the quality of food I am receiving but the complete lack of workplace integrity is mind blowing. 

Go to a different Taco Bell or another Mexican place in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best taco Bell in NC. It's everything a taco Bell should be. 

I really can't recommend it enough.  Brian behind the counter fuckin killed it. They had me food out in no time and even threw in some extra beans in a napkin for me. 

Don't get the hate. This place should have a higher rating. Maybe all these snobs should go back to Wendy's. Taco Bell is for the people. I love you and have a good day."}
{"text":"Don't stop hearing but sometimes we have to give in to the kids . With that said check your bags and never expect great quality one of the worse taco bells for me quality wise ."}
{"text":"I love hearing associates scream \"Are you f*cking kidding me\" in the background after I gave ample time for an online order to be processed. Obviously, they think closing time is at midnight. They might want to change their hours, if this is the case. Pathetic service. I will never recommend. Wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Ever since the new manager came on this place has gone down hill. The customer service is not what it once was, and I attribute that to the fact that I have not seen a few of the employees around that I used to be served by, as I was a regular. I will not he coming to this location anymore."}
{"text":"The guy working the counter screwed up the order, which was very simple, a crunchy chicken gordita, with only chicken and cheese. Initially he put in for a beef gordita, then got an attitude when we pointed out the mistake. What we got was a soft gordita, when we went back, the guy was more concerned with sweeping then getting the order right, the manager stepped up and took care of it, but the counter person could have at least apologized."}
{"text":"Slow as Molasses or something... Good grief arrives at 530 p and did not get food until 546p ahhhhhhhhhhhj"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever. It took us 30 mins to get our food, inexperienced workers, food was not very good. I would drive out of my way NOT to go to this Taco Bell. Seriously awful."}
{"text":"Got a Mexican pizza tonight and it had about a quarter sized thing of sauce and cheese on top"}
{"text":"When it comes to Taco Bell, I I know that I'm sacrificing quality of food and service in exchange for convenience and speed, but unfortunately this time they really underdelivered.

During a recent late night drive-through visit in addition to both the rice and shredded chicken being bone dry (in their defense, it was 15 minutes before closing, but still, if it's that bad, don't serve it!), they also forgot to an empanada we ordered .  Normally it's not a big deal to forget to bag an item, but when it takes 15+ minutes to finally get just a damned empanada, that's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Seems like the employees intentionally take forever in the hope that customers either drive off or just never come back. In my case they succeeded in both. No reason to stop here when Sonic and Cookout are next door."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill. Looks like the burrito supreme is looking more like a soft taco. \"Where's the beef!!!!\"
Cutting cost and over charging is not the way to do business.  I know you want make money but at least fill up the burrito to make it look like a supreme and not a saggy lonely flour tortilla.   I will not come back here ever again."}
{"text":"I'm so sick and tired of inconsistencies with name brand places. It just tilts me out. I shouldn't get so frustrated but if I or anyone else CHOOSES to spend their hard earned money whether $5 or $5000, it's a choice to be a customer somewhere so deliver service. I'm not expecting 5 star service from Taco Bell but if someone says something, do it.

The person at the drive-thru asks if we want hot sauce. YES, we WANT HOT SAUCE. and when you ask a hot sauce connoisseur if they want hot sauce you give it to them and extra. 

Well, I didn't get one hot sauce packet, not even one. So I'm ticked and annoyed because I can't enjoy the disaster food I'm about to consume. Also, we never got any napkins, sporks, and again no hot sauce. If someone goes thru the drive-in anywhere, don't you think it's automatic that you give at least napkins? I mean come on people, this is simple stuff and not only that it's easy. Put napkins in the bag. Is this hard? NO. 

I'm over it. Not going back. 1 star will stay. You can't change my mind."}
{"text":"Updating my review after making several more visits. This taco bell sucks. They have things on the menu that they aren't even selling yet (and the employee's haven't even heard of the item). They don't know what any of the specialty sauces are called. Twice now, I've gotten a side of chipotle sauce & spicy ranch, with barely anything in the container, for .30 cents. Constantly missing items. Incompetent yet polite employees. I am done giving this place chances!"}
{"text":"Tried to get drive thru at 1:50am today. I guess they didn't want to make any more food because despite seeing workers walking around no one answered the drive thru."}
{"text":"I normally don't come to this taco bell but it was on the way to my destination. The drive thru girl was licking her fingers when I pulled up, eating and drinking. I wouldn't even hand her my card until I knew she washed her hands... GROSS!!!!"}
{"text":"The crunchwrap supreme is the truth! Very tasty treat to hold you over for dinner. I normally don't get any sauce with it but this time I felt \"saucy\"  so I went with the Verde sauce and it was one of the better decisions of the day. The service was decent as you could expect from taco bell, but the facility was clean and the AC was ON! All in all, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Always mess up order through drive through. We keep going here occasionally out of convenience and they never fail to either forget something or out wrong item in the bag. Go to the one on waddell and Litchfield."}
{"text":"WHOA this Taco Bell is pricey. $4.59 for a chicken quesadilla and the HST put my whole order over $5!! WHAT?!

Also, they didn't give me a straw with my drink, which I didn't realize after I had pulled through the drive thru. 

Boo. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've received the wrong order going through the drive thru. I called to talk to a manager (Deserea) and she offered to correct my order if I came back tonight (what's the point of a drive thru if you have to go back) or replace my order next time I come in. Not even a refund. She said it must be a training issue. Regardless it's so annoying getting food you didn't order and can't eat but already paid for."}
{"text":"Can't beat the 12 pack of tacos for $12.99, great for the family plus the nachos! Yum ! If your interested in a dessert I suggest the cinnamon twist you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One star for the awesome cashier who felt bad and gave me a free beverage but... It really shouldn't take 15 minutes to get one grilled stuff burrito and when a guy who's wearing a paramedic uniform comes in and orders to go it means that he can't wait too long for food. It wouldn't burn me up so much but people who ordered after me got their food first. So based on my experience I'm guessing that Taco Bell hates first responders and does not want our business."}
{"text":"Cheesy Gordita Crunch Steak is AWESOME!!!!! Their service also very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I don't call me her often but when I do they are quick and always get my order right.  I usually don't go inside, so some of the pictures on here scare me a little bit, but so far my experience has been good."}
{"text":"This place is understaffed and there is nothing fast about the food. The wait time for me has been 15-25 minutes and once you're in the drive-tru, you are stuck. The wait time has been the same going into the establishment because again, they are understaffed. 5 people working during peak hours is unacceptable. 
Let's not even consider how skimpy they are on the serving size. If I knew there would be no meat throughout the crunch wrap, I would have just ordered a crunchy taco. 
There were only 5 team members yesterday and 1 was on the register and 1 on drive thru. 3 people making food for 10 guests in the lobby and 13 cars in line."}
{"text":"First off, they got my order wrong and when I noticed, I decided to see if their sister-store would be willing to just replace my order since I was already on the other side of town for business and could not just got back to alma school and Warner. When I got to the sister-store on country club the manager there said there was nothing she could do and to just call the other store to let them know that my order was wrong and since I had to drive back over there I should ask them to give me a free drink or cinnatwist for the inconvenience. I decided to call the store and I got the store manager Trevor, can we say that this manager was completely rude!! He told me he can't allow the other store to refund my my money, nor change my food. I had to go all the way back to his store. He started getting really rude and non understanding so I asked if there was a manger over him and he said no, I had no time for his attitude so I said I'll figure it out and hung up. I went back into the second location and demanded the name of the GM since Trevor obviously had no idea he had a manger over him and since this sister store \"couldn't\" do anything to help me. As soon as I asked for Connie's (The GM) name this manager was all of a sudden so helpful. She said she would remake my food and refund my Money- mind you this was something she said she could not do in the beginning. I should have not have and such a long encounter both rude and unhelpful just for two burritos or a refund. It was literally ridiculous. As soon as you want to talk to the GM everyone is so helpful when its already too late! Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"That's the nastiest crap ever. I wanted a taco salad.  I don't know what I  got but it sure wasn't a salad."}
{"text":"Added ice when we didn't want it we told them they gave us a free drink plus a correction. They also got the order wrote and gave us a free baba freeze! AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Staff needs better training on Long John Silver menu.  Always disappointed!  Whereas they've been spot on with any Taco Bell selections I've made.  I prefer seafood and live nearby,  so have to think long and hard before going here for dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible service.
Not only did I wait 30 minutes for my food and was treated badly but everything on the order was incorrect.
I wasted money to be served nothing close to what I ordered.
This place needs to do better."}
{"text":"Terrible service
First time going there with my friend as she just got home from boot camp, I had been driving my fathers truck due to a previous accident. What relevance does this have?
I ordered my food and asked for no ice in my drink (no big deal, one less step for them to do) get up to the window and it's filled with ice and the soda so i nicely ask if he an take the ice out and only do soda.
The worker rolls his eyes and hands it back with no ice and the cup not even half full. I get upset because I didn't think it was a hard deed, so I tell him \"im sorry but I said no ice then I get no ice with a cup not even half full, can you please fill it up because I did pay for it.\" The worker rolled his eyes again and dumped out the soda out of the drive window spilling soda all over my dads new truck. 
I was not happy so I called the store and asked for the manager and when he answered and I explained the situation he had said that there's nothing he could do and asked what I would do. (Keep in mind if your aan ager and have to ask a customer, you probably shouldn't be a manager)
Then at the end he said he would call back tomorrow and so I waited and didn't receive any call.
About a month later I go back to see if anything has changed and figured I'd give it a second chance.
WRONG! The second time I finally go, my order was wrong, food was not as good and employees were rude. I had mentioned im allergic to certain ingredients and asked them if they could please not get any in there.
I take a bite and ended up with hives and being sick because they we not cautious and did not take out what I had asked. 

I do not recommend this place at all.
Will not be returning and I have called the people higher up and only hope they don't treat anyone else with such disrespect."}
{"text":"Today I went through the drive through and they said they had one cook and ran out of beef. WOW! For peak times at lunch and only one cook."}
{"text":"Great taco bell, staff is very friendly and I've never had any wrong orders any of the times I've been here."}
{"text":"Just tried the grilled Stuft Nacho for the first time and must say - WOW! Taco bell really outdid themselves with this new snack. I think it's my favorite thing I've ever gotten from Taco Bell and could probobaly go eat another one right now =p 

The service was cool, and the location was fairly central. I also get the Mountain Dew Baja Blast which is amazing - if you like tropical anything with carbonation you should check this place out and enjoy a grilled Stuft Nacho."}
{"text":"Drive to the next one. I wish I could opt for ZERO stars. Waited behind only two cars for 15 mins. Then when I got to the window the girl handed me my bag of two chalupas. This is what they looked like. When I asked for fresh chalupas (that hadn't been sitting for 15 mins) they asked me to pull around to get fresh ones. There was a guy employee who was really nice and said he would compensate with a card and cinnamon twists since I had to pull around. I waited five more minutes and when he came up to me and gave me my chalupas I asked him about the cinnamon twists and he said the manager told him that they wouldn't do anything else for me since they remade the chalupas... wth... waited 20 mins for two chalupas. You can see in the pictures that my chalupas sat for so long that they seeped through the wrapper. Nasty."}
{"text":"I have to agree, maybe new management...but order was 100% correct, man at window was very nice. Why would anyone keep going back for years, if it is so bad?? I hope they get some more high stars to help their overall rating.  We will definately be back."}
{"text":"They were closed and we're not very pleasant while we went to the drive thru because the video screen was down so I have no idea if the service is good, but the guy was quite mumbly and rude"}
{"text":"Just came from there. I went through drive through placed my order with a large Baja blast. I take a sip before i leave the parking lot, and it's watered down so, I go back having to wait again two cars are in front of me. I get the the window and she asks  me what other drink I want without explaining. I said why \"she said she doesn't know why it's not working the back is full\" I just think she was to lazy to replace the box. Anyway I said I don't want anything just my money back. She seemed annoyed gave me my money with no apology or good bye...I won't be going there anymore with that type of service."}
{"text":"Come here usually late at night when there's not many other options. The staff has always been very nice and the food has never been nasty."}
{"text":"The workers here are super customer-friendly. I only go through the drive thru but they always sound like they are smiling through the talk box, and even when you go up to the window they don't look like they hate their job like so many other fast food workers. It's refreshing. 

As for the food, it is always prepared well here, too! Never sloppy and always tastes fresh. 

It's never too crowded whenever I go either, which is nice. 

I'm just not a great fan of the location. I'm not too comfortable leaving my car by myself in this area but it's the closest Taco Bell to my home.. hence why I always use the drive thru"}
{"text":"taco bell is my go-to for middle of the night hunger.  but no matter what time i go to this taco bell, i have learned to wait and wait and wait in the drive through.  i don't know what the problem is, but for the three years i've been going there, the wait is horrible.  if there was another taco bell closer, i'd go to it.  management really needs to do something about the wait time."}
{"text":"I come here quite frequently. The place is small, as you probably know, but overall the employees are friendly and helpful, and I've never had an error with my food. Impressive by any fast food standards considering how often I've come here.

A shout out to Wayne the drive thru guy. Always friendly, precise, and on the ball. The guy deserves a raise, or a promotion."}
{"text":"Probably...no, definitely the best Taco Bell I've ever been to.  The staff is super friendly (minus an older blonde woman), and I've never had a complaint with the food.

Once I had to wait particularly long to receive my food.  My impolite friend had already finished their food before I got mine.  So....4 stars.

However, the other day was \"customer appreciation day.\"  There were balloons everywhere, and the employees seemed extra friendly.  I asked if that meant they were giving out free drinks, and the cashier said, \"I could probably work something out for you,\" with a twinkle in his eye.  I got a free drink, and my impolite friend had to pay for his.  5 stars.

Hat's off to the manager at this location.  He runs a tight ship, and it seems like the employees really enjoy working for him."}
{"text":"This has been the worst Taco Bell I've been to.  The service is terrible.  I always order on the app to speed things up when I go to Taco Bell.  I have now gone three times to this location and each time their app software isn't working and they have screwed up my order.  Each time they have to look at my phone and verify I ordered.  Then take my order at the window.  This last time I went, they shorted me 3 tacos. I guess my fault for not looking at the whole order, but the line was backed up because they are slow.  Just looked at my bank account and they charged me 3 times.  I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not much of a Taco Bell person. The only things they have that I like are their Doritos Taco and the Mexican Pizza. That's the only reason I would give them two stars.

What I came here for was to try the Cantina Bowl. I decided on steak and anticipating it to be good. NOT! It is basically a knockoff of Chipotle's steak burrito bowl! The steak itself was flavorless and it had the pre cooked taste to it, meaning all they had to do was heat it up. There was rice, beans, lettuce, and some kind of chipotle sauce (kind of ironic since it was a ghetto imitation). Immediately after this review I am going to contact Taco Bell to tell them to either make it better or quit making it and just stick to making the Doritos Taco. If they take the Doritos Taco away, then that will just erase another star on this review.

Service was ok and the cleanliness of the place was decent as well. 

So if you are reading this and are thinking about getting the Cantina Bowl, DO NOT GET IT unless you want to ruin your apetite! I had to go to Chipotle that night for dinner just to satisfy my steak bowl craving!"}
{"text":"Slow service, always a long line. Solid Taco Bell food."}
{"text":"Ordered through drive-thru and their service was really poor. It took them 5 minutes to have my food ready in drive-thru.

The cheesy fries were fresh but the Taco was cold and dry.

Staff is friendly but the location is hardly ever busy."}
{"text":"I agree with the past reviews. They don't or hard for them to listen. We gave our order three four times. Had the fries supreme. It was okay. But had a craving for it. That and there seems to be just one person working there at the time. We waited awhile before she got our orders. At least she wasn't rude.

Be careful of the curbs going into the parking because you might hurt your tires if you overlook the right side."}
{"text":"Honestly, worst Taco Bell ever.

I love Taco Bell.  Its delightfully campy and delicious in a $3 way.  The wait  at this specific location is outrageous.  Sometime 30 min + in the drive thru with 4 cars.  No trays inside so you have to put your food directly on the table, and then they want to talk to me about my hair. I don't want to chat with you about my hair, I want you to clean all the trays people have used so I don't have to eat off the table tops which I'm assuming have also not been cleaned properly."}
{"text":"Third time in a row that this taco bell forgot to put items I paid for in my bag...very irritating. If you go through the drive through, check your bag before you leave!"}
{"text":"5 stars for employee Shae, who took the initiative on her own to clean all the dirty tables and sweep the restaurant's floor. Shae told me she knew it needed to be done. Shae is definite management material. She takes pride in doing a good job. Keep up the good work Shae !!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Taco Bell. The food is always hot. The staff seem friendly. And it's usually really clean inside too. I can't think of any negatives...other than it's fast food, so if I'm eating there, then my more sensible meal plans fell through.

Not sure why people are down on Taco Bell as a whole though. It's fast food, sure; but they're not out clubbing baby seals or anything. It serves a purpose. It's not a bad fast food option either. For instance, the Fresco Chicken Soft Tacos are only 150 calories with 12g of protein.

Overall, I'm cool with this Taco Bell. I'm not a frequent visitor, but it's a good choice if you need something tasty to eat in a hurry."}
{"text":"A great place to come to get something cheap really quick. Taco Bell is always great for a snack, or when you're craving tacos. I enjoy the happy hour values, great place for after school. 
I always get the mini chicken quesadilla , it's only a buck."}
{"text":"Had dinner from here the other night and I have to say I'm a little nostalgic toward this place. We'll not this one specifically but Taco Bell in general. Taco Bell was my first job while I was still in high school. So you see I have a bit of a soft spot for this chain. Anyways I had one of there asked things and it was pretty good. Wish there was a bit more meat but that can always be added for an additional cost. Bryan had these nachos that had shredded chicken on them and they were a lot better then I thought they would be. So much so that I plan In getting them next time we get Taco Bell. It's not the best Mexican food out there but at least I know what to expect when I go here. Also I have to admit I've dropped an empanada or into the cinnamon auger for the Cina sticks and man it makes it so good.   Also Cina sticks are just fried twisty past. Who would have thought."}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing Taco Bell of all places? It's because I patronize them more than all restaurants combined. It's my go to place for dinner on fly, the quick, \"I'm STARVING to death, I need to eat NOW!\" place. Sure they are certainly not the only place around us for fast food but they are the cheapest and most convenient (and IMHO the tastiest!)

As of this moment they have brought back the Chicken Flatbread Sandwich. Chicken, melty cheese, chipotle sauce and flat bread - Yum. It's got just a bit of a kick, but it sure satisfies those evening munchies. I'm a big bread and cheese fan so I like the Nacho Cheese Chalupas. Yeah, I can go cheapo processed cheese and at the same time still like Camembert as well! Ah, and as far as cheese goes I am still waiting for them to bring back the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito. I think out of all their concoctions, that one is probably my favorite.

This particular Taco Bell is very fast, has only messed up one of our orders once in the entire two years we've gone there and they are very cheerful. You will never want for condiments."}
{"text":"The service at this particular location is great whether it's in the drive thru or inside. The employees are nice, polite, helpful and they get my order correct. I commend the person or people who do the hiring and training of the employees. 

I ordered food for my family the other day. There were several items. I noticed that two bean burritos were not in my order that I had paid for. I forgot to call right away but called about five hours later. I had my receipt and offered to read the order number and the time or the order. I didn't expect them to do anything about it at that point but figured it didn't hurt to try. A nice young man named Tyler said he didn't need the receipt number, that he was sorry and to just let them know the next time we come in that he said I could get my replacement burritos. I did not expect that. He was so nice about it."}
{"text":"I went to this Taco Bell location on 7/21/17 and proceeded to place my order with a guy who had on a brownish checkered shirt with a Taco Bell label by the front pocket (so a manager?). First off, he was rude to me while I was ordering. Apparently, my request for a quesadilla meal and Doritos tacos meal don't exist in his world. After he told me that wasn't an option, I read off the board the number next to the menu option. He made up an excuse about how the quesadilla meal comes with a taco and he thought that I thought it came with two quesadillas. If he was the manager, hopefully he receives some additional training."}
{"text":"Out of beans! LOL  I know right. All my brother wanted was the usual, bean burrito extra red sauce - they were out of beans. Now we're stuck in the drive through with no way to get out. It took 15 minutes to get out :("}
{"text":"Doing this review based on their new breakfast item, the \"Waffle Taco\".

Saw the commercial for it so I decided to try it the next morning at the drive thru. It's a waffle shaped like a taco with scrambled eggs and your choice of sausage or bacon. I chose bacon.

I should of chose hunger. If you refer to my pic, it actually looks decent but looks can be deceiving. Dont expect the waffle to be crispy like they just actually toasted it or made fresh from scratch. It is obviously microwaved because it is already soggy when you get it. They give you a tiny container of syrup. You know, the kind of container you would dip nuggets in if you were at McDonalds. I guess you are supposed to either dip your \"Taco\" in it or just pour it on top. Mind you I actually parked in theTB parking lot so I dont make a mess. You definitely dont wanna be driving while eating this thing. So I pour the syrup into my taco. It had the consistency of watered down cough syrup. The taste? Ha, Robitussin tasted way better and I hate that stuff! This syrup tasted like actual tree sap. As for the bacon bits, you know how you can get imitation bacon bits at the supermarket? Well, they imitated an imitation. So what it tastes like is comparable to those knock off perfume and cologne bottles that random people sell in random parking lots. The ones that kind of smell like the real thing but only lasts like 2 minutes. The bacon bits on these things were basically red construction paper dipped in bacon grease and shredded.

I only ate half of it and was surprised I even ate that much. I guess I didnt want to face the fact that I lost good hard earned money for it? I kid you not, I coudnt wait til lunch came around so I can dump a lot of hot sauce in whatever I will eat in order to kill any remnants of that garbage I just ate. Makes me wonder if they test these things on animals. Good God, I just realized that we are the animals! 

This is not the first time I fell for their marketing gimmicks. Lets see, there was the Cantina Bowl, XL Steak Nachos, and the XXXL Steak Flatbread thing. All these were total fails. I guess the only person I can blame is myself because I keep thinking that maybe they will make a mistake somewhere along the line and use actual ingredients. Then they will be scratching their heads why all of a sudden people are lining up by the truckloads.

So in closing, I gave two stars because the only thing that I will ever have hope for is the Mexican Pizza. That has never let me down before and even if it does, the percentage of it making me sick is very low. Maybe because my stomach has grown tolerant of it? Gahh, that sounds scary. Notice I never mentioned the service. Fyi, I have yet to find one worthy of mentioning and this location is no different. Memo to TB corporate, stop smoking that weed and try real ingredients. At least put some of that weed in your product so we think its good when we are just actually hallucinating. Plus you get the munchies when you are high which in turn will help sell you more tacos. And no, I dont do weed. Well not voluntarily anyway. Sometimes you smell secondhand weed smoke and you get the munchies as well. I gotta go now for I think the DEA is knocking at my door.

{"text":"I just bought 12 tacos, 5 bean burritos, & 2 frito burritos. My bean burritos did not have no beans all tortilla. My tacos had no meat all  lettuce and cheese, and still didn't even fill up half the taco.  I just spent $26 on food for my family and everyone of us fell like we got ripped off for are dinner. We are looking through our fridge for leftovers because we only got half of our meal thanks a lot Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Take a few extra mins out of your trip and just go down to the tacobell at 67th and Peoria. The other store is nicer, in every aspect. Plus this tacobell doesn't seem to be a testing store so it takes forever for promotional items to get it."}
{"text":"It seems like we have issues every single time we come to this location. Most of the time, we wait in the drive thru kine for literally 20 min. Tonight we went inside because the drive thru was backed up. SHOCKER! We were in line for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were there. They finally called out to us their apologies and that they will be with us shortly. A few minutes later, one of them came to take out order. He was actually very nice. He gave us the senior discount and free drinks for making us wait so long. We waited another 10 minutes for our food. We finally got home and realized they left out my nachos. Nice! 

It seems that someone in the drive thru had a very large order.

People, if you are going thruu drive thru for half the items on the menu or ordering like 30 tacos, go inside. Stop making the drive thru so congested, making me, an injured person ordering a couple of things, go inside because you are to darn lazy to get out of the car. Not just at Taco Bell, but all drive thrus. It is inconsiderate, but more so annoying. 

I think that the management needs to take a look at the wait times. It is a constant problem. They just need to figure out a better system."}
{"text":"We go to a lot of fast food places, but this one is awesome! The customer service is always spot on. They smile at you, talk with you, joke with you, and overall have a positive attitude. We've been there MANY times and not once have they even slightly messed up our order at all. 

Compared to other Taco Bells in the area, this one has the best service and best tasting food!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here!! My cashier was Victory S. She was very sweet, great people skills!!! We had to wait a few minutes for our food to be cooked and she gave us complimentary drinks. Very pleasant. Great to see someone in the drive thru as perky and friendly as she was!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service, since I don't expect much from taco bell in general. The kid who helped me, Michael was courteous and helpful. Nothing crazy ordering a taco and quesidilla but I was impressed and thought I should give him a nice review."}
{"text":"Worst place the general manager has no knowledge upon customer service the assistant manager looks like she is homeless waited 30 mins two taco worst place ever"}
{"text":"I hate to be a dick. And by that, I mean giving a Taco Bell a poor rating on Yelp. But there are just some things that need to be brought to attention. 

This Taco Bell is extremely close to my house, which makes it an easy stop for a quick lunch or dinner or even snack. Two separate times I've been here come to mind. 

One was late on a Tuesday night, and my boyfriend and I decided to order at the counter and eat in the dining area. In our order, we asked for two sides of their nacho cheese. The young kid at the counter (who was polite) told us that there wasn't any nacho cheese, no big deal. He told us to hold on a minute, went into the back and asked his manager (we could hear him) where she told him just to tell us that we were out. Kind of suspicious..? Just tell them we're out? Huh. Okay. So we sat down, and about two minutes later the kid comes out and says that now they do have nacho cheese. Wow. Miracles do happen. Or, the management staff just made and employee lie to customers. It's called business ethics, people. She could have told him to say \"It'll be ready soon\" or \"Sure we're just making it right now\" but no, he was told to lie. Which is not his fault at all, but is the fault of the management staff. Food that day was nothing to get excited about. It's all Taco Bell and honestly you can't expect much. 

The second time we came here, we went to the drive through and in our order ordered 2 orders of cinnamon twists. We got home, luckily not far away, to find out that the cinnamon twists were shorted from our order. We drove back, and the same kid was at the drive through. He was nice enough to toss in a free cinnamon twist bag. However, when we got home my boyfriend nearly broke a tooth on one of the \"cinnamon twists\" that was actually an uncooked rotini-style pasta noodle covered in the cinnamon sugar. This was the part of the meal that really upset me. Taco Bell does not carry anything remotely close to pasta, meaning that the noodle had to have been placed in there on purpose or by some extremely odd and rare accident... It could have resulted in something extremely dangerous (breaking a tooth), but we were lucky enough that his pain was just temporary. Pictures of the noodle will be posted shortly."}
{"text":"I got my order wrong there one morning, and didn't catch it even after they had confirmed it twice. I didn't realize my mistake until I checked my food, and when I went to get it fixed they were SO kind about it (even though it was my fault) and got me the correct order right away. I could hear them telling each other \"good job, you guys are doing great\" in the back as well. Super positive experience, thank you Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"A really random review but wow this taco bell had great customer service lol. I was genuinely happy to order my food here because the ordering lady was so pleasant."}
{"text":"Very friendly drive through staff during the lunch rush. I was going to comment how my chalupas yesterday weren't exactly how I want them, but then I remembered this is Taco Bell. You Yelpers are insane."}
{"text":"Okay TACO BELL IS MY GO TO WHEN I WORK LATE SHIFTS AND AM TOO TIRED TO COOK. I ordered a Mexican pizza and two soft tacos. My soft tacos were soggy and when I opened my Mexican Pizza, I didn't even want to eat it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost, pulled in for a little snack before the Cards game and waited at the counter for 8 minutes!! No exaggeration, one guy washing dishes and he looked at my family of 4 and didn't call out to anyone.. finally someone came out of the back office while the smoke was rolling out like Cheech and Chong. (Now I'm Exaggerating) but who knows. Takes our order and another 9-10 minutes go by before our food comes.
  As we were eating I looked up to find a guy that looked like he was out of the Adams family, dirty stained shirt, crusty ball cap etc. He pulled his ball cap off and proceeded to scratch his head profusely with a pen!! Not cool!! 
Service and food prep sucked, I heard them tell another customer 15 min wait on the biscuits!! Wow it's Taco Bell and a KFC some stuff should be ready and I think biscuits is one of them."}
{"text":"Taco Bell has really improved over the years as they are simply the cheapest fast food option.  Most locations are serving up bigger portions such as their bean burritos.

Few years ago you buy a burrito and would get very little beans and taste mostly tortilla.  However, today you buy a burrito and you can enjoy your beans and sauce from the first bite to the last for just 99 cents.

I love their tostadas and even those are loaded now !"}
{"text":"Dining Room closed at 10PM on a Friday ?

Are you kidding me ?  My four year old son and I ended up having to eat our meal in my truck because the dining room was closed.

Anyways, the food is always fresh.  Reasonably priced.  Employees are competent and happy.  I have had no bad experience here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this last visit. The cashier in the drive through was Audrey M and she was pleasant and did my order right...thank you"}
{"text":"Closed at 1:54 am apparently. \"Server is down though they sounded completely fine on the voicebox.\" Says 4am but when i called they close like in 10 mins (from 2:02am that i asked) so open late is bullshit"}
{"text":"Horribly long service, very impatient and rude workers when we were trying to order. Like i get it you're probably really tired and it's late but why do that"}
{"text":"I ordered some burritos from here with no cheese, when i got home i discovered the incompetent staff put cheese on them, When i got there they gave a coupon for a free taco, I went to use it about a month later and i didn't notice the coupon expired back in 2016,  this is beyond shady, after that, they messed my order up again and didn't give me my full order, I'm done with this taco and taco bell in general,  it is just not worth it,"}
{"text":"Like others have said, great staff here. Mary is normally at the front counter with a big smile on at lunch time. Keep people this nice working here and ill keep coming back. You can get decent fast food anywhere, but great service is another story. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Came here to try to try their XXL Steak Nachos. Not impressed. Also ordered a Chipotle Ranch Chicken and a Chili Cheese Griller because it only a dollar during happy hour which is 2 to 5 pm everyday. Again, not impressed even though it is only a dollar each.

First off, the XXL Steak Nachos had hardly any steak on it. 3 times the steak? More like 3 little strips cut up into really tiny pieces. It wasn't even warm and it didn't even taste like steak.  From the commercial they make it look bigger than it seems and even the poster that is on their wall shows you a lot more ingredients. 

The Grillers? Flavorless and bland. I don't even wanna go into details cuz it would be a waste of time for me and you.

As for service, who the heck trains these people? Was just showing up to work more than enough to be construed as hard working? After we ordered, it took about 10 minutes before we got our food and there was only one other customer ahead of us that has already ordered.

On their door where you enter, they have a sticker that says free wifi. I tried scanning for their free signal but my phone couldn't connect to it. Maybe my phone knew better than waste its battery power trying to connect to a non existent router. 

In closing, this just might be the last time that I ever step foot in a TB. I try not to recommend other places out of respect but I didn't get any from your establishment so you are not getting any from me. That same night, I took my kids to Del Taco to make up for the bad experience.

{"text":"It's okay I don't have anything to say really the customer service is ok and the food is okay only had one bad experience where all of my tacos were crushed couldn't eat them with out a spoon it was horrible."}
{"text":"Service is horrible lady at drive is so rude. Then I go inside to order another meal and the hole staff is looking at me laughing because they messed up my meal. If I was able to jump over the counter I would and whoop her ass. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell. Food is always fresh and the staff is awesome. Definitely worth the drive off the fwy if you're craving some t bell!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and every time the food tastes like it's been sitting for days. The beans are always dry and flavorless at this location."}
{"text":"Close to my house. Good clean restaurant, super fast drive through. Everyone is friendly to me each time I go, and I'm here probably once every eight weeks. It does the job and when you want something you are use to, and know what you're going to get, that's what Taco Bell is for :) thanks! Super yummy chicken quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Very fast, very friendly, the food was fresh and hot. Sure, its fast food, but its nice to have some people who don't just take your order and throw your food at you. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed at this Taco Bell.  I stop here occasionally one my way home after work.  Each time I do, everyone is really nice and attentive.  I give 4 stars because in my experience they always try to the best of their abilities to keep things clean, provide that southern hospitality, make sure orders are entered and prepared accurately, ensure that the store is properly maintained both inside and out, then you have their speed which is really quick.  I've not had to wait much longer than 5 minutes at the most for dine-in or drive thru orders.  In the past two nights I've been I've noticed that they are extremely genuine in their interactions.  They made it a point to greet me warmly and even ask how my day was going.  This kind of genuine interaction is really what goes a long way in my book.  I also know that not every experience is going to be the same.  I can say that of the last 5 visits I've had at this location, only one had an issue and that was with the regular crunchy tacos not heating properly which caused them to taste a bit stale.  It wasn't a big issue and they replaced the tacos the next time I was there.  I hope to continue to be able to visit from time to time because this place is one of my faves.  

Oh yeah, don't forget to check out their new Popping Candy Freeze it has Pop Rocks in the strawberry icee it's super good.  I usually will change out the drink for one with a combo."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.  You crave it, you want it, you eat Taco Bell.  There really isn't more than that.  They mess up every once in a great while, but they are human and are always nice if you have a problem.  The dining room has always been clean the few times I've been in there as well as the restrooms.  My biggest Criticism would be the placement of the drive thru.  Be very cautious when exiting as I've seen too many people get the you know what scared out of them surprised to see a car crossing in front of theirs!"}
{"text":"If you're late night Craver like me this is the place to go. I tried another Taco Bell on Bell Road and quite frankly it's horrible. Here the tacos are excellent fully stuffed tasty. Nothing's ever out of stock. The customer service windows are excellent. These people got game."}
{"text":"This taco bell rocks. I've never had any major issues, other than the typical \"Dammit no sauce\" but still this franchise is usually very good and precise. Widdly Scuds can definitely be obtained here."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location is the BEST in Las Vegas. The customer service is beyond awesome. Everyone is so happy and friendly and so helpful. They do things really fast and neat. I never open a taco from here with things falling out of its shell ever. They wrap it nicely. Food is really consistent and hardly any mistakes with long complicated orders, if anything they remake the entire order for you with a smile. I am extremely satisfy with their service"}
{"text":"I used to eat a lot of Taco Bell back in my college days when I was broke. Now that I'm no longer a college student and a lot more health conscious, I rarely eat fast food nowadays. But once in a while, my inner fat kid emerges and the cravings will be overwhelming. 

The food is what you expect of any Taco Bell. It's fast, it's cheap and heartburn waiting to happen. However, it is deliciously so bad for you. Everyone knows their menu consists of tacos, burritos, nachos, and most recently added to their menu was the Quesalupa. My last visit, my food was piping hot. The tacos and the nacho chips were crunchy. And my nacho cheese was melty and hot! Their soda machine had 15+ options, but I always gravitate towards the Baja Blast Mountain Dew. The employee who took my order was friendly and smiling when he took my order. And he didn't seem annoyed when I asked him for extra Fire sauce. 

I can't give a fast food chain 4 stars, but I was pleased with my recent visit. I'll see you again in about 6 months!"}
{"text":"I have no idea about these bad reviews. I haven't met a single employee here that was less than stellar. Out of a the tons of times my wife and I have been here they have messed an order up two times. Corrected em both without a single blink. One of the times the guy came running out of the store after U.S. Because he caught the mistake before us. 5 stars easily."}
{"text":"I never expect much from taco bell... but wow these guys are awesome!  Friendly and fast, this location is fast food done right."}
{"text":"They close their window 20-30 minutes before they even close! Even when you'll pull up to the window they'll pretend no one is there even though there's cars out front. I called when my husband got in from work and told me that they wouldn't take his order. They're number wouldn't work, sounded like a fax machine number. My husband is a third shift worker. After work, he's sometimes hungry! :("}
{"text":"Frequent this Taco Bell fairly often and experienced terrible service yesterday.  Sonny, the shift manager, informed us upon ordering that there would be a wait for the food, as there was a backup.  We agreed and placed our order.  While watching everyone else get their food, we approached the counter 20 minutes later, only to find our food had been sitting there, but no one had bothered to call our number.  The food was completely cold, and Sonny had a complete attitude when we complained that he had not notified us that the food was ready.  He claimed that there was no way the food could be cold and was a total jerk, which prompted us to ask for a refund.  Won't go here again, as there are plenty of other TBs in the area with better service."}
{"text":"The new staff is incredible! They always make sure your order is correct and that you're satisfied!"}
{"text":"5 people working, waited 8 minutes for my food, the meat-like substance in my tacos was seriously watery. Oh, and music was blaring super loud. My earbuds turned way up we're no match for it. I think this is my last visit."}
{"text":"From  all  the  Taco  Bells  that  I  know  I  feel  that  this  one  is  the  one  with the  best  customer  service.   I  have  been  here  many  times  and  have  to  praise  the  employees,  If  something  goes  wrong  this  location  will  make  it  right.  I  have  always  been  under  the  impression that   they  really  care  about  customers  (and  I  am  not  a  big  fan  of  fast  food  chains)."}
{"text":"I don't think I ordered Vegetarian tacos.. I could be wrong tho. I received 3 Tacos with lettuce and cheese. There may have been some meat, but you would have to pick through all the other stuff to find it. Flat Soda.. when I handed it back through the drive thru she said \" Yeah we called, we have had problems with it\" SO WHY SERVE IT. This location is close to my house, but will not return. Would save time just flushing my money down the drain."}
{"text":"They messed up my order pretty bad. I don't usually come to Taco Bell but the one time I do, it's terrible. I don't understand, how they got my order so wrong. Order a big box, in my big box. I got a soft taco and I was missing the quesadilla. I can't even call them because they are closed. Terrible staff"}
{"text":"You wait in line for 20 minutes with an urge for a specific item, only to hear....

We don't have that.

This place is lord of the flys crazy from 10 pm to 3 pm, and understaffed. There are management issues here, as problems have been around for a long time. They need more ingredients on hand, more staff, and quicker turnaround time.

Always have great Taco Bell food when I get it."}
{"text":"Just had a Chk Chalupa Sup: Had to write a review.

This was probably the worst CCSupreme i ever had at a TacoBell.

CCS is my fav item and i know how a good one tastes.

The one i had here was disgusting looking , Very salty , very oily and least amount of stuffing you will ever see.

Will give it another shot (benefit of doubt on the employee who made my chalupa) and if it turns out to be same , thats it.
Never will step foot inside this TB again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Once I ordered and went to sit down, all the tables and chairs were filthy. Not just food all over them, but dirty. Then of course I looked all over and the walls, base boards and everything needs a good cleaning. Will not EVER eat at this location again."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has more than its share of problems.  Either they are out of an ingredient (Spicy nacho cheese or guacamole) discontinue regular menu items (quesorito meal box 1/11 - still listed on website !!!) and plasters signs everywhere for promotional items which they do not carry (Dr Pepper Freeze). Plus, service is rude and drive thru orders are usually wrong plus rarely gives napkins.  To eliminate stress I suggest the location at Waddell and Ltchfield.  you will save yourself a big headache."}
{"text":"Very clean Taco Bell in a good part of town. I drove through and was in/out within 5 minutes. I did a gut bomb, I admit. I had a burrito supreme, regular taco, and plain iced tea. The only wish I have is to all burrito makers: spread the ingredients out. We all must know by now that Taco Bell doesn't do this too well. I get one big bite of sour cream and then it's gone, no more sour cream throughout the burrito :( sad face! It was all fresh, it was all good, it filled me up and I'll be back in a month. Thank you."}
{"text":"For some reason the night I came here the line was way backed up and we all were so stuck we just turned our motors off in the drive through to wait ...but ya finally I got my food and it was just as expected, taco bell food."}
{"text":"Lady @ the drive thru proceeded to confirm my order with me & then hand me a bag full of random shit I didn't order. & I am a vegetarian so it isn't like I can just eat whatever."}
{"text":"Witch at the drive thru today. No substitutions allowed? Since when? I feel sorry for people who are so miserable that they get a kick out of being the taco substitution police."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is regarding the awesome service level provided by the white guy working the drive thru.  
Always smiling, quick and accurate order delivery.  
Well worthy of 6 stars!

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Right off the freeway when you exit Cheyenne on the 15. I usually stop by here on my way to my late night class at CSN. 

The drive thru is kind of at a weird angle. If it's your first time here you might get confused on where the drive thru starts. 

They currently have a strawberry starburst freeze, and let me tell you, this thing taste just like a Strawberry Starburst. It's mind blowing! I actually just come here just for that! If you come here during HH which is I think from 2-5? It's only $1 for the regular size! What a steal! It really is good. I ALWAYS get here after 5:10pm and they still give it to me for $1. Yes! 

Staff is always nice. But of course it's fast food so expectations shouldn't be so high!"}
{"text":"When you want or crave \"Americanized\" Mexican fast food, Taco Bell is the place. It is cheap, fresh & taste good. Can't go wrong. There are so many choices to your \"tacos or burritos\". You can custom order your taco etcetera for example if you don't want lettuce they will accommodate your wish. They have combo meals or al la carte items. This location always does a good job on my orders and are always polite. This location also serves Kentucky Fried Chicken, has lots of seating & parking and a Drive-tru."}
{"text":"Slow, lax, service! Got 4 tacos with no cheese, 2 strands of lettuce, little meat*&!  The tall (mustached) male mgr was obnoxious and didnt care. Not managed well."}
{"text":"The employee turn over at this location is horrible as is the training! This last visit will be my last . Two cars ahead of me in the drive through and we sat for almost 15 mins before all the cars behind me backed out then I did the same . I called the store to tell them of the situation and they just canceled my order. I get it when it's busy but there were two cars ahead of me and only a few people the place. If an order is taking too long have the person pull forward and walk it out when it is done ."}
{"text":"Showed up at 1:50 suppose to be open until 2 little upset find it ridiculous that there closed 10 minutes before I'm in the food industry and if there \"open until 2am\" then I'd make sure to be open until 2am"}
{"text":"Descent Taco Bell. Friendly service. A little tiny on the inside but pretty quick. Frequent it enough and have enjoyed it thus far."}
{"text":"If you're going to close early and leave all your lights on, including the drive thru light,  at least pay attention when people are sitting at the sign waiting to order. Is that not common sense?"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell, but the amount of times my order has been taken (literally) or my food was wrong is ridiculous. I was there 2 nights ago and ordered a breakfast crunch wrap and a loaded potato griller. FIRST they weren't checking receipts and a drunk girl took my food (I had already been waiting about 15 minutes to get my food) then when they remade it they gave me a regular crunch wrap. Of course that wasn't realized until I was home biting into what I thought was my correct order. Not the end of the world, but I was quite irritated by how things were handled."}
{"text":"The wait is so long that you can die, go through the after life, die again, and the order still wouldn't be ready"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I have to check my order. Drive thru or ordering inside. There is something missing or not right. 

This location has been recently renovated. It is in a convenient location and open late."}
{"text":"Slowest. Taco Bell. Evar. Came at 8pm, not very many people but yet so backed up that it still took 20 minutes after ordering to get the meal(compared receipt time to actual time order received). Could probably get faster service at a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Instead of standing there waiting, looking like a fool, how about you have your drive thru order taker help their teammates dig themselves out of the pile they are stuck in. Dont hire new people(the line workers were working hard), hire MORE people. One star review for service speed. One more star added for the friendliness of the crew and quality of the food."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about when they combine food brands (this location is a KFC/Taco Bell) but the employees at these types of locations become a master of neither brand. This review is in regards to Taco Bell as I never get KFC.  The quality of food has been weird compared to any other Taco Bell food I have had. The service here is also terrible. Waiting for a long time for as much as an acknowledgement is common whenever going through the drive-thru just sitting at the speaker as well as order inaccuracies. They also do not have the freezes at this location. Overall, compared to surrounding Taco Bells this location and the other one at N 67th Ave and Happy Valley (another combined one that's paired with a Long John Silvers) are way below par."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell in the area in regards to both food/brand quality and customer service. Every time I come the staff is always very friendly. I usually order through their mobile app to avoid the lines ( there usually is one here since many others recognize this is a good location), but go inside to pick up. I have never had a problem with order inaccuracy, customer service, or food quality here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped to grab a late dinner. We wanted to go through the drive thru but the line was so long and slow we decided that going in and getting it to go would be faster. After dealing with the rude cashier girl and paying, a cook decided to tell us it would be 45 mins to an hour for our food. AFTER we paid. I continued to tell the cashier that if I would have been told that before i paid I would have left. They both got an attitude and proceeded to tell me that they would make our food first. After 10 minutes, we got the food and ate some, I found a HAIR in my burrito. I am NEVER going back to this Taco Bell location again."}
{"text":"I waited 25 minutes at the drive-thru to receive two cold tacos. This location is a hit or a miss. SMH. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!

I purchase the tacos for my daughter and an hour later all of it came back up. She was so sick. I will not support Taco Bell anymore!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive though and I ordered a Mexican Pizza with sour cream, and a Dorito's Loco Taco. Received a Mexican Pizza with no sour cream, and a regular taco. The customer service was so/so. I wrote corporate and complained because this was about the millionth time they have screwed up a order when I was the only car in the drive through, and they sent me a coupon, for two items of my choice, and the GM called me and said I could come in and she would replace my food. Glad they fixed the problem, but I really am starting to believe their employees just go through the motions of their minimum wage pay, and could care less if they screw up or not. Seems to be the trend at most fast food places now a days."}
{"text":"Slow.  This place had one person working the shift at about 10pm.  I should have been there and back in about 15 minutes but it took almost an hour.

The service was friendly so that helped a little bit.  Filling 3 orders in an hour is ridiculously slow for a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon Taco Bell craving...20 minutes later still waiting in the drive thru line. Come on...."}
{"text":"When I came inside there was no one in line I walked up to the counter. There was a young black guy as the cashier. He was looking down I stood there for a couple minutes and I then asked him can you take my order or are you busy. He said \"what do you want\" placed my order I had coupons on my phone and he did know how to use the coupons.  He said theybdint do any kind of coupons but psper ones threw the mail. Finaly the manager came over and took care of it. After getting home with my food it tasted gross we ordered off the LJS menu and it all tasted like the oil was old needed to be changed.  Could not eat it called store over and over but the phone would ring a few times and then a fax would pick up."}
{"text":"Wow I went back to this Taco Bell again as it just a few blocks away.  Well tonight August 23, 2015 at 7:00 PM I go I  to get a couple burritos and was told they are out of tortillas....  Yeah out of tortillas lol.  A Mexican restaurant out of the big staple you would think if the see there going low they would be borrowing some from another store."}
{"text":"Very bad service waited 15 min and they got our order wrong and to fix it they gave us some crappy cinnamon twists very bad place"}
{"text":"They don't give you much food.. I got breakfast and the $1 flat bread had maybe half an egg and a sprinkle of meat.. I posted a picture.. I also got 2 breakfast burritos and it's all tortilla and their cheese sause I don't think I had any egg.. the only breakfast thing that was at least decent.. was the breakfast crunch wrap.. but the hash brown was undercooked and the sausage was over cooked.. very disappointing breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is always correct which is great because I always special order without onions. Quintin, the employee in the drive thru, could use a class in manners though. I understand it was lunch hour but a smile and a simple thank you would have been nice."}
{"text":"let's not get carried way here! it's taco bell but the service is great. They don't cheat on cheese or sour cream either. The food is always good. This is probably the crown jewel of snow rd fast food places! you can eat here in less time than other places take to get your food."}
{"text":"Would've given them no stars if that was an option! Place is nasty, the employees are rude and cannot get an order correct. It took them 4 times to get 3 tacos correct! Snotty girl behind the counter actually responded with \"what now?\" when my bf and I pointed out their THIRD mistake with our order!!! What balls....never going back to this place. Manager didn't do anything and witnessed the whole thing!!"}
{"text":"For fast food, fast is not the word to describe this place. Takes way to long to get your food, and it wasn't busy. The food was fine, but the time to get it was not. I am not sure if the place is understaffed, but it sure seems like it."}
{"text":"The first time I came here food was good. Warm not hot. Not enough sauces for how much food I got. I sit here on my phone in the drive thru at 1106 pm typing this as no one answers my calls of hunger. I don't want to be that ass hole and honk. I have tried calling out but no one is answering. Pulled around front and it looks like they are doing inventory without a headset on. So drive thru won't be acknowledged tonight. *sigh* I will admit defeat and go home and eat a sad bowl of cereal. C'est lavie (however you spell it no insults meant)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco bell. I always get the same order. Shredded chicken burro and bean and cheese burrito with sour cream in it. At most locations I go to, they skimp on the portions and quality. THIS taco bell is amazing and never skimps. And its 24 hours which is the best part. The staff late at night is amazing as well! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the cheesy potatoes with sour cream not the best for your and deff a winner on the taste buds"}
{"text":"I love taco bell, especially their new nacho fries. The only thing i think they need to do better is hire some more people because every time i have came here they only have like 2 cooks working and i have to wait around 20 to 30 minutes for my food and the drive thru is almost always back up all the way to the entrance almost. Other than that, food is great and never had a problem with any of the food i have ordered and i have never encountered a mean or nasty employee, so good job with that."}
{"text":"I was on my way making a delivery for Postmates. It says the business hours are till 1am, and they had actually closed 15 minutes before hand. I stayed at the drive through waiting and no one came...as I proceeded to drive off the cashier was standing outside getting something from her car. I drove by and asked, \"are you closing early tonight?\" And she responded with its 1am... which now it was 10 minutes till. Then I told her it's not even time yet, and then she proceeded to lie that they ran out of meat?! This is ridiculous. I had to cancel my order and drove out for nothing. Whoever owns this specific franchise needs to keep a close eye on the workers since they are going home early."}
{"text":"plenty of parking. standard taco bell service."}
{"text":"Man.. talk about hot sauce Nazis. I ordered 4 items and got 3 sauces. Cmon guys.. we're talking about pennies here."}
{"text":"Service is great.  Takes a little more than average time to get food.  Lots of smiles from the staff and that's always appreciated. Few fast food restaurants get more than a three from me.  It's what you'd expect..."}
{"text":"Help!   I'm stuck in the drive-thru. I can't go anywhere.  This is an hour of my life I can't get back.  Ok it's only been 20 minutes to order but we know it's going to be an hour.   If you go to this Taco Bell DO NOT go through the drive through.  You will regret it."}
{"text":"Okay I stopped here today just for a drink nothing major. I went to the counter and waiting for up to 2 minutes watching 3 workers talking near the drive thru. It wasn't about business because they had their phones out and laughing. They saw me waiting to order but they didn't come over. The restaurant was empty because it was around 2-3 pm. I was patient but in the end I decided I didn't need a beverage that bad."}
{"text":"What a dump... staff is very slow. Everyone seems to be joking around instead of serving customers. Had to make my order 2x cause they couldn't get it right. Shame"}
{"text":"The bathroom is a one person. It is nice and open and clean.the food was great! They were all nice!"}
{"text":"Perhaps we've passed our exit and there is no going back of any sorts. We are doomed to live in the outcome of a millennia of bad decisions in the name of progress. Our good fortune has timed out and the sweetness we once savored has become sour. Some belated recompense bagged up for the Tuesday night trash pickup like the fall's leaves once beautiful in their windy shuffle now just carbon breaking down in a non biodegradable bag. 

The only oasis in this languishing landscape is this Taco style Bell. 

We claim to see the patterns set before us but we contain only the capacity to fool ourselves evermore. Over sensitized and underwhelmed we wonder whimsically through this overbearing existence lacking understanding of even the simplest concepts.

However often the thought of ending this thing so poorly described as \"life\" crosses my miscreant mind I trudge on only knowing there is a half dozen \"SPICY POTATO TACO\"s and \"BAJA\" style \"BLAST\" in my near future. Thank you employed humans of this food station for saving my life on a bi-weekly basis. For this you will be served in great fortune in the afterlife. I will see you there."}
{"text":"Ok so I clearly ordered a Quesarito with NO MEAT /w potato substitute plus a side of tortilla chips & cheese... first off the there were no chips in the bag I had to go in to get them - (obviously I went to the drive through because I did not want to go in ) ... then when I got home my daughter could not eat it because there was meat on it - The receipt clearly stated no meat ... this Taco Bell Gets worse every time we go... now I know why the guy at the window was weird when he handed us the food ... I am writing a letter to the board of directors and the local franchise owner ."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. The furniture is like chipotle kinda modern for a taco bell. It was clean. There's wifi. They were nice as well."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell... How much different could it be from every other Taco Bell out there???

Everything was pretty good here. Average. Nothing to rave about. My nachos bell grande actually had enough of everything on them without making my chips soggy. Especially enough cheese! 

The guy taking our orders was having none of my humor :( 

There are NO mirrors in the bathroom! Wtf is this nonsense? Also, the big wooden stall doors tend to slam. *BAM!* yikes! *jump* *cringe*

I know the water comes out of the same nozzle as a soda, but it came out brownish. I know this because I set my little clear water cup down on the sink. I really really hope that was just soda residue."}
{"text":"So you needed to read a review before going to Taco Bell? That's pathetic, it's fast food and if you are old enough to check yelp surely you have slammed some sketch fast food tacos by now. Go order a twelve pack, grab a few handfuls of fire sauce, and go to town. It doesn't matter if it's clean, it doesn't matter that we don't know what they are made of; it's all part of the adventure of trashy American fast food."}
{"text":"I just sat behind someone while they ordered for a good 4 minutes. As soon as I pulled up to the voice box the guy told me they were closed and refused to serve me even though I was clearly there before they actually closed. That to me is terrible customer service and I could never do that so one of my customers. My household spends at least $100 a week here and now we will not come back. Thanks again Taco Bell. (3/1/2016)"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, but I also like customer service. The cashier Tameria L. was not very friendly or fit for the position of cashier. Our entire transaction consisted of 2 words. I felt very uncomfortable ordering."}
{"text":"Taco Bell!!! It's as you expect it be and satisfies the craving when you have it. The nacho fries were pretty terrible (soggy), but everything else was typical TB. This location was a bit slow when we went."}
{"text":"My happiness might have something to do with that I came here after a night shift and I was famished. That said, for a $1 breakfast burrito, I was pretty pleasantly surprised! The eggs taste real and aren't rubbery, the crispy potatoes are tasty, and the pico de gallo isn't that bad. And at 340 calories, it's not a terrible nutritious choice for breakfast on the go (or, depending on your situation, a bedtime snack).

I normally make fun of Taco Bell and won't go there very often, much to my husband's chagrin. But now that I know I can get a decent breakfast for $3 including a drink, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The staff is always friendly, I usually go thru drive thru. Sometimes the monitor works and sometimes it doesnt. The staff typically has the order right and depending what day of the week it is your food is yummie. Sometimes it is burnt if its the younger crowd in the kitchen. But its quick service and if they get something in your order wrong they fix it quick. Kudos"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars.. I would. I waited in line, for 15 minutes PRIOR to even ordering. When I finally got, to order the jerk cut us off after everything we said like it was the end of the order... then she fell silent for 5 minutes until we said \"hello?\" ... and then got rude to us!!! Then when we finished the 2nd part of our 3 part order she gave us the total !!! We didn't even get to finish...when we got to the window I told her it was the worst customer service and we didn't even want the food after all that waiting... and she says \" ohh myyy godddd\" you want $15.00/hr GETT REALL"}
{"text":"This has got to be the slowest taco bell anywhere on earth. Pretty sure I could have gone to the grocery store next door bought all of the stuff and made it at home before I could have been served here. The line didn't move for more than 20 mins and I was stuck and couldn't even leave."}
{"text":"Drive thru packed flimsy mex pizza box on bottom of bag, crushing it and sticking to food. Also got 2 wrong items. Way to go TB!"}
{"text":"Love this resturaunt even though i dont work there anymore still one of my fav places and will continue to support them"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is inexpensive but very good!  I always go thru the drive thru, it's fast, and the employees are always very nice, never seem to make errors. I usually grab a breakfast burrito on the way to work. I especially enjoy the hot fresh coffee!  The employees seem to take pride in what they're doing and that always makes the experience better."}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell ever. I cannot believe I still keep going to this place. You always end up waiting 20 minutes from the time you order your food to when you get your food. There is absolutely no sense of urgency here. Either the manager is oblivious or just doesn't care."}
{"text":"It's disgraceful how a particular person and his/her friends went after this business with fake reviews. 
I've been coming to this TB since July 2015. Its very clean....clean enough for the Health Inspector to eat there) and the Manager and Assistant Manager are dear hearts. They will jump through hoops to make anything right.  Big personalities with smiles. 
Years ago, I got a serious illness from a dirty restaurant and it took me 5 months to recover but I will eat at this restaurant bc of their attention to the health code.  The Food Inspector eats there and that good enough for me. 
The food is fresh (not made ahead of time, their ice tea is tasty and as far as being overrun with kids that's not true.   The customers come and go as usual. It's not a kid hang out!!!  The clientele is what is has been for the last 50 years, if you recall eating at TB's. It's a family place, folks. Christmas time brings a sizable, adorable Christmas scene inside the restaurant for all to enjoy and once a month the farmers bring their unsold fresh, fresh produce and sell it for $10.00 for 70 lbs (I'm pretty that's the the weight.). It gets mobbed. TB donates the proceeds to charity. 
Please give these good people a chance.  This is not your normal TB.  ( I am just a nearby neighbor.)"}
{"text":"So we went to this location for lunch. The line was so slow. We spent about 20 minutes total in the drive thru. I thought this was fast food? Then, the girl who took our order had us repeat ourselves at least 5 times. We should've checked the bag before we left, because the ENTIRE order was wrong, including missing items that we paid for. These stupid kids really need to figure out how to do their job. I am not happy."}
{"text":"Every reviewer thinks their an expert ,well I am to so all I'm going to say is that this a tacobell not a 3 michelin star restaurant.  Tacobell  !!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Taco Bell with typical Taco Bell menu (other than the Popeye's Fish they serve from the same kitchen/counter). Not sure if some of the people in the kitchen could speak English. One employee on break sat in front of a small TV in the seating area which was VERY LOUD and ANNOYING. Every table was dirty despite it not being very busy, and the bottles of condiments at the \"fixin's\" bar were filthy. Can't beat the prices, though. As usual, I left \"stuft\" on two bucks."}
{"text":"I always say it's so hard to review chains.  This Taco Bell is located close to my home.  This is where I am torn.  It's also next to Roberto's Taco Shop.  I actually enjoy some taco bell every once and while.  I really think the only reason I go is because of the drive thru.  When you have 2 kids in the back of the car, it's kind of hard to unload the kids and get down sometimes.  

When I go to taco I usually order the same 'ol things.  I get a bean burrito and some nachos.  The food is ok. I have left this taco bell missing some items, so that gets annoying.  Overall it's a taco bell.  Chains are consistent.  What ever you get here in Las Vegas will be the same in Texas and other place in the country.  The restaurant stays pretty clean when I do go inside and the workers usually look pretty happy.  If you want something specific from Taco Bell then check it out.  Otherwise, there are plenty of other fast Mexican food joints close by.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"For a quick bite to eat late at night, this place will do.  Nothing over the top here, it's pretty straight forward.  

Service was fast, maybe a little too fast.  We ordered our food and within minutes we had it in hand.  I say maybe a little too fast because when I unwrapped my burrito to eat it, it was put together rather hastily and fell apart while I attempted to eat it.  Made for quite a mess.  But it is fast food, and it is Taco Bell, so I guess I really can't complain about that.

Dining room is open late, and the drive thru is open later.  Later in the evening it is not as busy."}
{"text":"Right, so......

First off, hire employees that actually appreciate having a job.  Not ones that are there because they are forced to.  That way, maybe you can actually earn a decent review.  If you start off with a bad experience with an employee, you're not going to get a great review.

I went here midday on a Sunday.  Thought that was a great idea, especially when I got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there.  Finally order and pull around, I wait another five minutes.  I could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me, or if the sit down area inside was packed, but there was no one else there but ME.

I'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name, that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.  All I can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine.  I was made to feel like I was interrupting her day and that I should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.

You know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes, I just used that word)?  Leaving the drive thru, driving the distance to my house, walking into my house, sitting down to feed my face and find that part of my order wasn't given to me.  *enter angry expletives here*

I doubt I'll be revisiting this location again, I'll drive the further distance from my place the next time I'm craving a taco or two."}
{"text":"You have to love Taco Bell's slogans of the \"Fourth meal\", and \"Eat Great, Even Late\"  because I\"m starting to believe Taco Bell's parent company really want the passage of legalize it to become reality, and thereby making the theory of Sly Stallone's movie  Demolition Man a reality.   Taco Bell wins the franchise wars due to late night munchies attacks, and Harold & Kumar never made it to White castle because there so many Taco bells around the area.    Just kidding Taco Bell.

I'm not a monster fan of Taco Bell, but my middle school aged nephews loves this place, and so I\"m forced to eat here every so often.    I have to say, this is a rather new Taco Bell location, and it's very clean inside and out.   Service is always quick, and I have to admit I\"m kind of fan of the new rollers.  The concept of baked potato with sour cream, bacon, and cheese in a grilled tortilla is pretty tasty for quick snack.  Man, I hate that calories intake tor such small pleasure.   

I notice Taco Bell have increase their menu size, and have a bunch of new items to order.  Different types of tacos shells, a celebrity chef deal for Carne Asada, also a Cinnabon snack, and some type of frutista freeze (which wasn't bad at all)   because of this, I\"m wondering if producers and writers of the Demolition Man got it right because opening late nights, making changes in the menu, and talk of legalizing the green stuff might make that happen.    Oh thank heaven for 7-11, this might not happen after all....or will it?   Time will only tell"}
{"text":"I moved to AZ two years ago.  Unfortunately this is the closest Taco Bell to my home.  I have given this location 5 opportunities to fulfill one wish - burrito supreme NO BEANS.  5 times I've ordered, 5 times I've received a burrito with beans.  I've tried ordering it by simply saying \"no beans\" - came with beans.  This last time I said \"no beans EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME\"  - came with beans.  It reads NO BEANS on the screen.  It says the same thing in the kitchen, right?  Guess not.  Never once was it made incorrectly back home in IL.  Guess I'll stick to TB once per year when I go home to visit.  
Service is always very friendly.  Too bad the crew creating the food doesn't pay attention."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru, gave the guy a complicated order. I got like 20 types of burritos and tacos. He got it right the first time, he was very friendly and professional. His name is Nick. I will definitely go back to this location because of him. I wish all Taco Bell workers value their jobs like this guy. Thanks, Nick."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, yes I said it, but this is the worst one ever. I don't know what they are doing to make it taste so bad. We have even thrown our food away. I keep trying it again, because it's close to home, but it hasn't gotten any better. I'll try again in 6 months until then I'll take the extra drive."}
{"text":"Love the music here...oldies but goodies.

7-layer always good!

My go-to place before class.

Soft tacos always good."}
{"text":"Open late, quick taco fix with double Decker taco. Its a hybrid taco that has soft taco outside filled with beans inside then another layer of hard shell taco then inside has beef tomatoes lettuce sourcream n sauce.. also had the Mexican pizza...mmmmm mmm good."}
{"text":"Horrible! Takes forever we have been sitting here for 20minutes and still waiting! This is the slowest fast food ever! We only ordered 3tacos and a Dr.Pepper! Officially 30mins later food was acquired at 9:29pm. #smh"}
{"text":"I mean, it's Taco Bell. Not much to say.
This building is very outdated, definitely needs an update. The food is alright, I haven't had any issues with the ordering. They aren't very busy though, so I think the workers could be nicer."}
{"text":"I know, I know. Yet another Taco Bell review. lol

This location is located on the east side of Jones just south of the 215 freeway exit. It is actually located in the same area as Don Tortaco. 

This is one of the better TB locations in the city. I've only been here a handful of times so far, but they are really friendly here. Like other reviewers have stated, the people who work the drive thru are not only happy, but actually display some personality! Every time I've stopped by here there has been some funny quip or remark, all in good fun. 

Really the food is your standard TB fare. Nothing to really distinguish it from other locations. Which is just fine. I like it. That's why I come here. 

It's the customer service here that makes it a little more enjoyable. Plus the fact that it is close to the house certainly doesn't hurt either!

3 stars."}
{"text":"Taco Bell has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. Especially those chicken soft tacos! Love 'em!!

Since moving into the area last May I've been here an average of 2-3 times a week. The service here is always friendly, and usually pretty fast. This place is much better than my former Taco Bell up on Craig Road.

The building is newer and the place always looks to be very clean. 

Until I discover otherwise, I believe this is the best Taco Bell in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have really been procratinating on updating this review. I really wanted them to do something that would give me an excuse to bump them up a star instead of taking one away....but after repeated visits, that never happenned.

Its a solid 50/50 shot everytime I come here that they will mess up SOMETHING with the order. I don't understand. This happens even when its slow and I'm the only guy in the drive thru. It's just not that difficult.

One thing this location also does for me is underscore the fact that the TB on Serene is AWESOME! This location is slightly closer to my house, but after multiple dissappointing visits over the course of the past few months, I have finally gotten to the point where it is well worth my while to drive to the Serene location.

2 stars...and at times that may be a bit generous."}
{"text":"Ok, how rediculous am I? This is my fourth Taco Bell location in Las Vegas that I am reviewing. What can I say? It's a guilty pleasure and I like it. Frickin' sue me!

Despite what that little map says on the Yelp page, this location is actually located on the northeast corner of Flamingo Road and Decatur, not the north west corner.

I was out running errands and happened to be in the area, when I felt the urge for some wonderful chicken soft tacos. Those things are good anytime of the day or night! 

Anyways, the main point I'm trying to get across with this review is how impressed I was with the customer service at this location. Yes, I know it's fast food. Yes, I know it's Taco Bell. Yet I was greeted with a smile and an acknowledgement and treated like they were actually glad to have me here. Seriously, do they give them a commission here or what?? lol They were THAT nice. I certainly didn't expect that and it definitely left quite the impression.

Not only that, they didn't skimp out on the portions! They were actually one of the more generous TB locations I've been to in that regards.

...and believe me folks, I've been to my share of TB locations in this country!

Anyways, for the above reasons I'm giving this location 4 solid stars! When in the area and craving some TB, I will make it a point to hit this location."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location can be found on the northwest corner of Sahara and Maryland Parkway. Back in the day I used to hit this place up when I used to lift at the LVAC on Karen which is nearby. Stopped by the other day to get my chicken soft taco fix.

This place is just not one of the better Taco Bells in the city. Typically there are longer than average wait times and the service is decent at best, even by fast food standards. 


FYI, there are decent options to eat at TB..

-Chicken Soft Tacos are only 170 calories each
-Chicken Burritos are a bit more at 420 calories each

I like to grab either 2 chicken soft tacos or 1 chicken burrito...my cheat food :)

Honestly, it's not a horrible location, but you can definitely find better Taco Bells in Las Vegas.

2 stars."}
{"text":"Says open until 9. Got here at 8:50pm (see pictures) and doors were locked. Employees like to go home early?.."}
{"text":"It's taco bell lol. You can get a lot of variety for very little money and it tastes good :) Sure it's no authentic real ingredient restaurant, but it's a quick lunch lol"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Taco Bell ever! I'm pretty sure the cashiers are all high. I was given about 25 hot sauce packets for 1 burrito. The owner of this Taco Bell should be ashamed. So excited to get this in this neighborhood and now I can't come back. I came in today as the drive thru takes 45 minutes to go thru no matter what. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Just came from Taco Bell. Highly upset... the older women in the back asked if I had my Mexican pizza and I told her I didn't. She continued with a harsh rude \"BRING IT BACK!\" Like she didn't believe me. I'm sorry but ask for the bag of food nicely if you don't believe me. Moral of the story, I wasn't happy at all with the way my service was and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Consistently good . Frequent customer . Usually pretty quick service and always friendly."}
{"text":"It's another Taco Bell,   I haven't really had an experience that stands out.     They're in a business park area so lunch is too busy and after lunch is dead."}
{"text":"Newly opened Taco bell,   I've only eaten here once - but they are (naturally) very clean, modern,  and the staff seems to be working to make this a successful location.       It's a taco bell so you know what's on the menu already,  now it's at this location too if one of the other ones isn't close enough to you."}
{"text":"They were so nice!         We arrived on a Sunday and it was obvious the staff was having a tedious, relentless sort of evening so we gave 'em a bit of levity and patience - in return they made sure we were extremely happy with our food!  

The kitchen staff and the manager on duty were super friendly and even made us samples of a frozen Baja Blast confection soon to be offered in Taco Bell restaurants (and offered to give us free full size ones,  but we were so full already!) 

The overall dining area was clean,   I didn't use the restroom so I don't know what that was like.       

Not a 5 star restaurant, but a 5 star experience at a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"5 stars for a Taco Bell? 

Context is key.     Yes,  it's Taco Bell and for the most part the food from this one is identical to the food from any other Taco Bell.   Everyone knows what to expect from the Bell.  

So the 5 stars are for the staff and management.    They're always extra friendly,  they're always accommodating to my bizarre recipe changes - the facility is orderly and clean and in the 100+ times I've eaten here I've not had an order mistake or any poorly made, spoiled or otherwise wrong food."}
{"text":"I had a series of particular and picky orders later one evening about a week ago. The girl at the front counter was super helpful and despite managing the other customers, the back staff for my specific order needs, my food came out a bit slower but beyond expectations for freshness. I was actually very surprised. The only negative exception was that my soft taco tortilla smelled like and tasted bad moldy water, and I waited longer than I had anticipated (but exchanging that for fresh Taco Bell?? No problem!) ...I ate in-house and had a more pleasant experience than I had anticipated. When I need a taco fixing, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"When wanting to eat something simple and cheap...Taco Bell is the place. I ordered Nacho Bell Grande. Simple nachos to satisfy your hunger. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"I used to like this location but my opinion is lowering slowly as time goes by. It's Taco Bell so you can't expect much but the staff used to be awesome. Now there are a couple staff members who I could do without. I went in after work yesterday and the cashier seemed to be in a frenzy. She was vibrating and talking a mile a minute like she had just finished a case of red bull. There was no line was I don't know what her deal was. I asked for the $3.99 combo with soft tacos. She asks twice if I want hard or soft. Odd since I specifically ordered soft. Then she adds an empanada to my order for no reason. Get her to fix that. She asks if I want to make the fries supreme for .99. I say no. She adds supreme anyway. I let it slide as I'm tired and cranky and don't want to lose it on her over .99. So then they make my incorrect order and sit it on a counter. I'm looking at it. Waiting. Apparently we were waiting for another employee to come over and weigh each item on a kitchen scale before putting it on the tray. I'm assuming this is a cost control measure, but really what are you gonna do, throw it out and start over? Ain't nobody got time for that. It's Taco Bell meat paste, not a precious metal. Anyway, standard Taco Bell menu. Cheap and abundant. Awesome staff 75% of the time. Don't bother with the KFC menu, they have ghetto pieces of white paper taped over half the items saying they are unavailable (for months and months)."}
{"text":"I love taco bell but it seems the cooks there don't feel the same about me. My order always gets taken down correctly but when it comes to actually getting what I ordered, it's never right. Nothing like a mouthful of onions when you specifically ask for none and the receipt shows that's what was sent back to the cooks"}
{"text":"Food is great service is great, best Taco Bell around, they have fixed some prior issues also."}
{"text":"The longest wait I have ever had at a Taco Bell or anything fast food joint matter of fact. Simple food, simple orders, yet complicated for them to make? Sad excuse of a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"For fast food it's okay. The crew is fast. It's a clean restaurant. Nice people. If you are hungry and can't wait to go home and cook this is okay"}
{"text":"Repeatedly this is by far the slowest drive through I've ever been to. Even when there are no cars, it's still slow. Otherwise the food is typical Taco Bell which we like. Other TBs are much, much faster"}
{"text":"It says they close at 2am but we went at 1am and they were already closed. I wish they would honor the hours posted on yelp. We drove out of the way just to go to that location"}
{"text":"OMG! Fire Jalissa! This moron wouldn't listen and kept walking away and got our order wrong even when we saw that she had messed up and tried to inform her she walked away as we tried to make our food with no beef. She was rude and short and had an attitude when taking payment because of our order being slightly complicated.  Then it took twelve minutes to get our food which was wrong. Horrible employee!! Not coming here while she's working!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how to start this but here I go. I really enjoy taco bell it good for what you pay. This isn't a place you come to and expect amazing service or food but when you come you would at least expect decent customer service. Today I was quite disappointed in taco bell. It wasn't thee food that was bad or took to long it was the bathroom and how the  employees reacted towards it. I had walked into the bathroom with the toilet over flowing with paper towels and toilet papper with human feces all over them falling out of the toilet. I had left the bathroom in disgust and almost loosing my appetite. I had seen an employee walk into the restroom and when he had walked out he proceeded to laugh at the bathrooms currently state telling his fellow employees about the situation. What I think makes this whole thing worse is that I had walked into the restroom when had first arrived and nobody had went into the bathroom the whole time I was there and I was there for a good 30 minutes and even while leaving the bathroom was still left in its current state. I have pictures but I am not sure if you can add pictures to a review on yelp.-wyatt gottschling"}
{"text":"I went here through the drive thru last week and then this week I go for breakfast, and the signs are all taken off and the windows and doors a boarded up. It closed really quickly"}
{"text":"I love this taco bell!! It has the nicest employees, they're polite and friendly and I really appreciate it. My order has never once been messed up.... and I don't have to ask for napkins or utensils. I've never gone inside so I can't speak for the lobby/dine in.
The only thing I would suggest is that the owner put a shade up around the order board, you can't hardly see anything after the noon sun starts heading that way"}
{"text":"You must be wondering why in the world I'm giving Taco Bell four stars. I would. It's a fast food restaurant that serves high fat ground beef tacos slathered in sour cream. 

What we tend to forget is that's why you come here; to get that quick fix during your lunch or dinner hour. You don't come here expecting top-notch Mexican food and if you do, well, baby steps I suppose. 

Service is quick and food is what you expect. Why would I rate it any lower?"}
{"text":"It wasn't my first choice that night. It wasn't even my second choice. It was the only drive through that seemed to want to help anyone. The food was filling without much flavor and it stayed with me at least till I got home."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times as recently as last night.  Its a typical taco bell. The service has always been quick and they've never gotten an order wrong. Its just too bad that the food goes right through me. I think the strangest thing I've eaten so far was a Volcano Burrito with fire sauce. Do not eat something like this before you go on a long car ride or without having Immodium handy."}
{"text":"Service was ok seems like a lot of young kids working here, got our food fast , I like xtra hot sauce on my food, that makes everything taste better!!"}
{"text":"The person who took my order was very nice, but I specifically asked (twice) for a VEGGIE power menu burrito and even stated that I am vegetarian. I got home and took a bite of my burrito, to discover it had chicken in it. On the screen when I placed the order it even said it was the veggie burrito. I haven't eaten meat in over three years and I am horrified that I ate chicken tonight. It was awful and I hope that in the future no one else has to go through what I went through."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell. This is strictly for the customer service in the Drive thru. They are AWFUL. Yes we all have days. I get it. But when it's always rude and faces change. There is a problem.  I asked for extra cheese to go with my nachos. OK that will be 70 cents are you OK with that? Of course that's fine.  Well thank God I ordered that because there was barely any cheese on the other and cold.  May I have more napkins here's one catch it in the wind I know your vehicles full of people.  Or I pull up to the window. \"Me\" Hi how are you doing today? Trying to get up out of here and I just got here. Not- I'm Good and yourself they don't even ask! Don't ask for hot sauce. You get 2 packets and we know that's not enough. May I have more? 2 more is my luck! And nothing but sheer frustration and disgust because you would like some hot sauce or the napkin that you barely caught. 1 lady who is an absolute sweet heart  I believe is a shift lead or manager? She had beautiful mixed kids out in the dining room one time that were so polite waiting for her to get off work. No they aren't always there! But I never get her name. She's great. Nothing good to say about anyone else at the window."}
{"text":"There is an older black lady that works mornings. She is so mean. When you are  ordering, she says \"you what do you want?\" When I couldn't find it on the menu and I asked her she says \"can't you read the board\". She is like this every single time. The first time I thought maybe she was having a bad day, but it is every single time. I have talked to other people that go to that Taco Bell and they say the exact same thing. When you get up to the window to pay, she just grab your money and doesn't say anything. I will no longer go to this Taco Bell, I go to another one that is out of my way but at least they're Pleasant there. One star because of this person."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS GROSS! These taco bells have all been knocked down and rebuilt due to conditions that no longer make them sanitary enough to eat at.  Now this being said i like taco bell and I eat their healthy options because im not obese, as well as i don't go there much but this particular location which is unfortunately near my work i have been to several times.  The workers are illiterate which i spelled wrong and used spell check taking away all credibility but really scummy workers, gross place and my order has been messed up every time ive gone, go else where but not culvers because they SUCK TOO, and i dislike you if you like culvers honestly they shouldnt be in business"}
{"text":"Pretty good! They always take care of me and when I use mobile ordering, it's so nice that my order is done really quickly. I am weak for those cheesy bean and rice burritos and some other taco bells make them terribly with not fully cooked rice or a bad mixture of the ingredients but this location has never let me down! Definitely doesn't hurt that it's right across the street from my house. Just wish they were open all night for those late night burritos desires."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a one star. ALL the tables were dirty, there was only 3 people working which made the service extremely slow. Took seriously 20 to get out food and there was only 4 other people in here. I understand that there are people in drive thru but management needs to step it up in their employment,knowing that this is a busy area. Whoever is in charge of this taco bell needs to be replaced"}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago. Ordered 2 cravings deals and a bean and cheese burrito with extra onion. I drove home and then realized they forgot the extra burrito. Drove back and went back in line to get it, while in line my husband calls and says one of the tacos was smashed and only had meat and cheese in it. So he sends me a picture and I get that also remade. I get home and my husband says \" was there suppose to be a chalupa in there?\" I said \"ya why?\" Husband says well mine had 2 tacos and one only had meat and cheese in it. I told him to look in my box to see if they put both chalupas in my box. I looked in my box and it's 2 tacos again with the same meat and cheese on one and it was a literal finger width line of meat and cheese. So I call Taco Bell and they said to come back to remake my box because my husband already ate his and I'm pregnant so I wanted the damn cravings box lilenit was suppose to! So I go back they remake my box( should have gotten my money back) and I get home and the freaking chalupa was just the soft chalupa part and not with the hard shell with cheese in between. I drove back and forth 3 freaking times to still get my order wrong! This place is the worst! Train your damn cooks in there! I was so annoyed! I'm never going back to this one again!"}
{"text":"Driven past this place hundreds of times from the way home and finally cracked one night craving one of the new Cool Ranch Doritos tacos.  I took advantage of the 24 hour drive thru and the employee was very friendly (although he kept calling me \"boss\").

Food came out quickly and we were on our way in under a couple on minutes.  Once home the tacos were AMAZING (seriously whoever thought about making a Doritos into a shell is a game-changer!).  On the minus side I ordered a triangle cookie like dessert with frosting in the middle.  It's prepackaged and wasn't that good, hopefully they still have cinnomin twists, because thats what I'll get next time!"}
{"text":"Got carry out after a long day and ordered a crave big box I ordered all items in the meal with chicken instead of the normal beef paste. When I got one and finally sat down to rest and eat...only one item had chicken in it, the rest were still beef. I'm all for raising minimum wage, but the quality of work needs to be worth the cost. Now I have to drive back in to get the rest of my meal. This is the second Taco Bell that has messed this up this month."}
{"text":"My husband went through the drive through and got me a taco salad.  I haven't even touched it yet.  It's the most pitiful taco salad ever!!!! There's hardly anything in it and I don't recall ever having rice in it.   Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This guy in the drive thru has the best drive thru voice ever! He is missing his calling as a phone sex operator! I haven't tasted the food yet but he alone gets 5 *'s!"}
{"text":"Just came through the drive thru to pick up some lunch and was informed that they don't have hard taco shells OR soft taco shells. Really? What's left? Why are you even open?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of negative reviews for this location. I've noticed I wait a bit longer here no matter the time of day, however the food is some of the FRESHEST taco bell I've ever had. 4 stars for wait, but fresh food"}
{"text":"I went here 2 days ago and ordered through the drive thru which took literally 20 minutes. Then I got home and I asked for hot and mild I got hot and fire. I was missing 2 of my items. I figured whatever it gets busy it's not a big deal it happens. So I went there again the next day. AGAIN, I was missing 1 of my items, and was given fire and hot instead of mild. My food was not hot it was barely even warm. I have never had such bad experience with any other Taco Bell except this one."}
{"text":"Second visit..both times my food has been fresh made to order. I ordered beef chalupa's supreme and nacho supreme. The chalupas always taste fresh out of the fryer perfection, and the nachos were fresh not sloppy or soggy. I have only gone through the drive-thru and it's always the same nice lady. This location is not your typical Taco Bell. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Excellent cutsomer service, clean and consistently good food. Alberto is the manager and he does a great job running this place."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell so I think legally I cant give it 5 stars.   I placed my semi-custom order and the food came out perfect.  The staff including Dante are all super friendly and really make an effort.  This Taco Bell is better than your average fast food joint."}
{"text":"I always opt for the Taco Bell breakfast menu items if I'm feelin' fast food in the morning. As I'm checking in at this location I speak with a gentleman that has a standing bicycle outside. I asked him if it's on a bike rack, indeed it's not. So I tick the Yelp question \"no bicycle rack\" and he continues to explain that he's had several expensive bicycles stolen in as many months?! Unbelievably, a kid enters the west entrance only to make his way exiting the north entrance and stops at the mans bicycle?! After closer inspection he decided the bike isn't worth the grand heist and moves on. On this visit, which was done in they forgot an item on my order. Also, if your an adult an you order the orange juice, expect to be disappointed as to the size :-/"}
{"text":"OMG slowest Taco Bell on Earth no matter when you come even if theres hardly anyone in line!!! And they always screw up simple orders!!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at this place again!!! The food they tried serving us was cold and stale like card board! To top it off, they charged us for extra toppings and didn't even put it on our order! My wife took the food back and the manager had the nerve to sit and argue!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, fast service, clean environment. There is drive-thru available as well. Today we tried their new product: Kream Ball which is basically a sundae with chocolate chunks at the bottom. Big healthy portion. Nice clean restaurant with lots of seating and lots of parking spots available.

Come here for some delicious fastfood with a side of guilt afterwards."}
{"text":"..Again, taco bell is americanized fast food. It's great food in a pinch, or when it's 4 am when nothing else is open. Sorry on the poor picture I submitted, it was literally a monsoon. 

Specific to this taco bell were some cracked taco shells, every other taco was on par with what you'd see anywhere else in the world. 

I have to be a cruel horrible person and give it 2 stars simply for the cracked shells. lol, also it's just taco bell, I mean come on. What did you expect."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and overall experience. I did not receive my full order. Spicy potato taco was 90% lettuce and \"Nacho Fries\" had no seasoning. If I want sh*t and I can drive a couple miles to the nearest Jackinthebox. This location will no longer have my business. My experience took place on 2/4/18 @ approximately 11pm"}
{"text":"They gave me my chalupa with no FUCKING sour cream.
Then I ask for mild sauce and she gave me hot. I'm done son"}
{"text":"Wow! Two awesome customer service experiences in a row at a fast food restaurant!? That's unheard of! They are over-the-top in their friendliness and it's a refreshing concept. They even try to have a conversation with you at the window!

I come here every once in a while for lunch because it's so close to work and have only tried a few things on the menu. So far, no complaints.

Thanks for being so cheery :D"}
{"text":"Tonight we went to Taco Bell in Monroe where the old Kmart was located. Halfway through dinner I discovered a roach in my food. I called back up to the location where the \"manager\" told me she wouldn't give me my money back ($25.00)and she didn't have to do anything about it. I then asked to speak to someone higher up than her and she would not let me . I then asked for her name and she told me she was not giving it to me because she didn't want to get in trouble. This is absolutely disgusting and should be shared all over social media!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a Quick stop for breakfast burritos and a couple bean burritos. Got out for under $7. \"The beans were good too\", per my husband. 

Being on our way back to California, I was impressed they were fast and accurate. No problems. It was a very clean place. Friendly staff. Large eating area. Located right next to Home Depot. The food hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I bought two taco salads last night. The shells were so rancid that I could not eat them. They had been around too long or they were cooked in rancid oil. I'm not going to this Taco Bell again."}
{"text":"This place is trash and dissfuctional these people didn't like there coutomers and i had to wait 32 minutes of 1 potato taco"}
{"text":"Its Taco bell with long john silvers... its pretty nice staff is nice and quick... pretty clean..."}
{"text":"The \"fast\" in fast food apparently doesn't apply here.  I was on my way home from work,  appx 9:30 Friday night. The drive thru was busy,  so I went inside.  I was one of 2 customers inside when I went,  and the other had already ordered before I arrived. There was no acknowledgement,  and it took forever to get my order (combo #2 - grilled stuft burrito and a taco).  I don't understand why it was so slow either. .. There were 5 employees just within my line of sight. As a matter of fact,  I've been able to type this entire review so far as I wait for my food... From a clumsy phone keyboard. I realize Taco Bell isn't typically considered fine Mexican cuisine,  but the service wasn't great,  even by their own standards.

Update: I am going back and increasing this review to three stars, because even though the service wasn't the best, the food was good when I got it. I think this location has a lot of room for improvement though, at least on the service side of things."}
{"text":"This location shouldn't exist. They are rude, and the prices were higher then every other Taco Bell I've been to, we just left before paying 

Ingrid Cam was the rudest"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru and was asked by Jerimiah if I wanted sauce for my order. I stated hot and fire. He yook my card and when he reopened the window I said lots of got sauce, he said hot sauce and I said Yes. We got our order and there was no sauce at all in either bag. I waited till he open the window and stated he had given us no sauce. After he rolls his eyes, closes the window without saying a word. He finally comes back and gives me 5 packets. With the size of our order, that was insufficient. I pulled around and went into the the restaurant, I told the cashier ehat had occurred. No apology, no let me get my manager instaed he hands me a bag and said get what you want. So needless to say I will NOT ever visit your restaurants again in the future. And I will assure I tell every person I know about your horrible service and bad employees"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. There's are 3 people just standing in the front while we've been in the drive thru for 20 minutes, no that is not an exaggeration. Once you are on line there is no exit and you have no choice but to stay in line. This place needs a wake up call. Human sloths of the earth work here and they need to be taught basic human skills. Seriously they have no hope in life, you will all work here forever. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This is a typical Taco Bell that has the new decor on the inside.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The restroom was clean with no issues.  The food was typical, so if you like Taco Bell then you will like the food here."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE WORST TACO BELL I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO. We go here a few times a week, and it never fails that they always forget to put give us one of our items that we were charged for. Or they mix items up. It is more of a chore to eat here than it is convenient! Managers are very unprofessional, I asked for the district managers number and the manager working at the time refueled. This Taco Bell is also very dirty inside. 
Needless to say, this Taco Bell will be my last resort when trying to decide where to eat!"}
{"text":"Ordered two crunch wrap supremes, a taco salad, and two burrito supremes. 

There's not very much ingredients in the food.  See my previous picture of the taco salad.  I paid $21 for this?

I won't be back.  I am not impressed."}
{"text":"First we waited inside for 15 minutes even though there was only one person in front of us online and seven people working inside then we couldn't take it anymore so we got in our car and went through the drive-through where it was impossible to understand anything the first girl was saying now we are still waiting this was a nightmare we have been here for such a long time forget about fast, skip this place"}
{"text":"After trying to Blueberry hill the day before and been dissapointed we decided to just do anything quick the next time so we headed to Taco Bell just before leaving Vegas so we stopped here just off the strip and needed something just to give us some fuel for the drive back, and well theyre cheap like any other taco bell on the food, chicken burrito was ok it actually surprised me."}
{"text":"I don't know what the deal is with this location. They never ever get your order right. Tonight I waited at the window for almost 15 minutes for nachos and a couple of cheese roll ups. While I'm sitting there waiting the guy in the window took his glasses off and cleaned the nasty goop out of the corner of his eyes wiped it on his shirt and then grabbed my food to hand it to me. I don't know who the manager is but it's consistently bad."}
{"text":"this used to be my favorite taco Bell in town, fresh yummy food, always piping hot,and never skimming on the ingredients just the right amount. but NOW since the remodel they have truly gone down hill..food is ALWAYS cold takes forever and things are always wrong/missing ugh and it's the closet one to my house, time to find a new one"}
{"text":"I have never gotten better customer service and more friendly staff at any other Taco Bell. Matthew R L was really great! Really awesome staff and when I ask for a lot of hot sauce they give me the perfect amount. I usually have to go in to the Taco Bell to get more sauce, not at this one."}
{"text":"Really good customer service, everyone is always happy there and I always get the correct order, and they always move quickly! One of the best service I've gotten at a fast food restraint"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in drive thru for Food. They closed the lobby down early too. Both are regular occurrences.  It's time they get an \" estimated wait time \" sign in the drive thru so you don't end up stuck. Not kidding."}
{"text":"Wife and I usually stop here during our weekend yard sale excursions. Never had a issue, very nice crew."}
{"text":"A consistent struggle to get fast food 'fast.'   On 3 separate occasions, and against my better judgement, gave it another shot.  Again my wait for food was 20+ minutes.  Once given, the order was correct and tasted exactly as I'd expected.  No issues with the food.   But the wait was stunningly long.  At least I had the presence of mind to park in the lot.  Those locked into the single lane drive-through line weren't so fortunate.  They were captive in their cars with no esacpe and seething mad.  

Today figured I'd try to get in a bit before the lunch hour crush to avoid the long wait I'd experienced before.  Sign on door said dining room open from 7am yet it was not.  It was 11am.  It was closed.

Their management has to take control of this one.   Facility is quite clean but a woefully under-prepared and unproductive team has created extraordinary waits that had many patrons simply turning away. Taco Bell management will need to get involved with this one.  Further, it appears they've not taken time to study the receipts and timestamps to know how they're going to anticipate the day-to-day business spikes of customers and products being ordered to staff properly and eliminate the horrendous waits. 

If you're heart set on Taco Bell the food is fine.  If you're in a hurry would highly recommend you consider another Taco Bell, else a good amount of your entire lunch break will be spent in line.   And for the love of Pete DO NOT use the drive through!   Once in the drive through you're committed and there is no going back."}
{"text":"$35 worth of food, and not a single mistake.. need I say more??

Employees here are awesome, top notch, friendly, patient, go above and beyond to make a simple trip to Taco Bell, enjoyable. 

Keep up the awesome work and the high fives when I come thru!!"}
{"text":"As a vegan, it's exciting to be able to go to a fast food joint and order vegan.. but. Cause it's a custom order 9.5 out of 10 times, my order is wrong and I can't eat it.. this location nailed it!! 

Ordering at the speaker, never been easier, the guy was quick and got everything right, he was professional and best thing NONE OF MY FOOD WAS WRONG. 

Best Taco Bell experience in a looooong time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"6 guys workinh.. 3 cars ahead of me.. 1 behind me.. 15 min later, you do the math.

This location is seriously lacking. Always a hassle and long wait."}
{"text":"They've gotten our order wrong here about 12 times now, we live nearby so we stop by for dinner when it's just one of those days. Lol. Customer service and speed is usually ok."}
{"text":"$2.00 value meal, cheery service crowd (almost too cheery) and that new green sauce which blows their others away."}
{"text":"Only been here once. Had a small order so there should have not been any problems. Place is very clean, and kept up. Crew was very nice."}
{"text":"Like the previous yelper said! Rating is the service. Usually the food all taste the same! That's why we keep on coming back!!! You will have issues on the service, what do you expect? Most of them are minimum wage kids! They are just starting life! So like any fast food franchise, you get what you paid for! So be patient!"}
{"text":"Yep! It's open,
With the growth of Surprise, there are going to be a whole lot more restaurants, fast food joints, and many other things opening around here. Taco Bell is one of the first! What can I say? I am a Taco Bell believer, really fell in love with them in my bachelor days! Saved me a lot of money! Love there flavored meat, and yes the are beef! Don't care what anyone says! Just like any other fast food joint! Service is the same, you get what you paid for people! Glad they open up!!"}
{"text":"Tortillas are always stale. Pizza is always either raw or burnt. On several occasions i have found that the staff had placed a new time label over another to avoid cooking fresh pizzas. 
The quality of the food at this location just always seems to be sub par. I have lived near this location for ten+  years and its always been the same. So i go to the brown and mesa dr location"}
{"text":"Can I not score this lower?
No extra large cups ever
Wait forever in Drive thru and the only car
Employees need a smoke more than a job where customer service is provided"}
{"text":"FOURTH MEAL!  24 hour drive thru!

And it's right off the 101 so coming back to my place from a night of drinking in old town or phoenix, it's quick and easy to stop here."}
{"text":"You know how the commercial says \"Open Til Midnight Or Later\" and then there's a little asterisk and nearly illegible text at the bottom of the screen in 1pt font that says \"Participating locations only\"

This is not a participating location.  :("}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. Not only did they forget a part of my order, they gave me chicken chalupas when I ordered STEAK.. (the cashier even repeated it back to me) also, my chicken bowl was nothing like it was described and was missing some ingredients it claimed to come with. The cashier appeared quite lost and didn't seem to know how to work the register and swayed back & fourth as a nervous gesture? Awkward. Anyway. Not worth the $20. Should've just went to in n out."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever had in my entire life I asked for cheesy potatoes and they gave me KFC wedge fires and added sour cream and nacho cheese! Chalupas tasted like they were made this morning. No one was wearing gloves or anything I'm definitely report this location to Taco Bell head quarter and to health department!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how long it is taking in the drive thru. It's a good thing I don't have any place to be or I'd definitely be late. I've been sitting in this line for 45 minutes! Absolutely ridiculous. I won't be returning, and I would NOT recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"What is the point of a drive-thru if at a minimum it's 15mins? Ordered two burritos today, by the time I paid and received my food it had been 15mins. This place needs to be shut down, they clearly cannot keep up with customers inside or out. What a nightmare."}
{"text":"I am really confused on how something as simple and straightforward as a single burrito can be messed up but thank you Taco Bell, you have succeeded in doing just that. I ordered a protein burrito fresco style without rice. I get to the window only to be asked if I wanted rice in my bowl to which I confusedly respond \"I didn't order a bowl but if the burrito has rice...then no I don't want it\". I waited 5 more minutes to have a second person come to the window and asked if I had two orders. \"Uh no...(but I would like my single order that I have been waiting on\" only to have him look at a bag in front of him and shove it in my direction. So let's recap...I ordered a protein chicken burrito and 10 minutes later I received a burrito with nothing but tomatoes, lettuce, and beans . Great job guys...the only thing more frustrating than your obvious confusion for how to construct a burrito was knowing that I wasted 10 mins of my life and money only to have to still get something somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a KFC and a Taco Bell combined.  This is the closest taco bell to my area and after the last 4x in a row of getting my order wrong I won't ever go back and have lost faith in Taco Bell at other locations also.  

The drive thru is extremely slow all hours of the day.  The employees are grumpy and no smiles are to be seen. Don't dare tell them your order was wrong because they will let you know that YOU must have ordered it incorrectly. 

KFC has the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen. Mini chicken farmers must be where they purchase their products. A thigh was about the size of a chicken wing at a pizza parlor.  It's often over fried also. 

Taco Bell my order is ALWAYS wrong. I like extra sauce... If I ask for it I will get NO sauce at all... Every time without fail. So I stated asking for green sauce on the side so I could get my extra sauce.. I have to explain to them to just put it in a container. It's not rocket science. I rarely make special requests like this but if I purchase extra sauce and don't get it this to me is being an untrustworthy company.   I Ussually have missing items, never give napkins in the drive thru either.  My last time there I got someone else order... It was a very large order and I just drove off with it. I was so feed up with the BS and mistakes I kept it. I ordered a burrito and got a meal for 4 LOL."}
{"text":"Stopped at this Taco Bell at around 9pm on a Friday on the way to a trip in Parker, Arizona. This was just off the highway so we thought we would grab a few snacks here. After all, it is Taco Bell and we always know what we want here. So we parked, used the facilities, and then got in line to order. 

There were three younger teenagers (maybe 15 at the oldest) that were in front of us ordering. They requested water cups for some free water. The moment they got out of line they went and started to get soda. To my surprise, a manager walked over and politely told them they could have water with those cups, but not soda. One kid got \"huffy\" and the manager asked them to give him the cups or they could leave the restaurant for the night. They gave the cups over and ate in peace. This was actually quite interesting, but I appreciated that (1) the rules were followed for those of us that pay for the fountain drinks and (2) that there was a manager on scene to deal with issues like this. It is always good to see the manager doing something. 

We ordered several smaller items off of the dollar menu and a few cheaper things. Nothing fancy. I actually hate sour cream so I asked the cashier if they could make a few items for me without sour cream. You'd be amazed how many times they say they can do this and then forget. But not here -- everything I ordered had no sour cream. In fact, as a big moment of customer service, they told me they would add a little extra cheese sauce to some of the things I ordered to compensate for no sour cream. Wow! That was nice -- not asked for, but totally amazing in my opinion and it made everything extra yummy. 

One member in our group is a vegetarian and got some of the cheese quesadillas and some bean and rice burros. She was satisfied with everything and said this was one of the better tasting bean burros she had from a Taco Bell recently. 

Of course, the Mountain Dew Baja Blast was delicious. There was an employee that came by and was wiping down the machine area, picking up any messes, and then was walking around and wiping down the tables. Overall, the place looked a lot cleaner than I have seen some Taco Bell's while on the road. I really appreciated that everyone seemed to be doing something. Even the kids that had their free water cups taken away were enjoying themselves. We didn't even have to wait long for food. 

My traveling group really liked this place. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I expected to get a burrito supreme when I ordered one.. instead I got a burrito supreme toquito..."}
{"text":"A very nice establishment. the lobby is clean and they make the items pretty fast. Its obviously under good management. A nice young lady at the cash register was very helpful to us, she had us do a survey 'tell the bell' and gave us free cinnamon twists afterwards. The other ladies in the back also seemed cheery and over all had a great and friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Two or four items were missing from my drive thru order!  I called for over a half hour and the phone was busy... Probably off the hook!  And it is 11pm and I'm not going back!  It's so disappointing when you think you have your entire order, and when you finally get home and sit down in your pajamas to eat your dinner... and half of the order is missing!  Bummer...."}
{"text":"THE WORST LOCATION!!!!! 


The slowest and the most rude. While I waited in line I could hear others having problems with their orders. 

When it was my turn to order the cashier and looked like a manager (Ingrid cam) took her cell out and had a personal call. She even put her finger up to show \"one moment\" ...there is a line and I am a customer!!!! 

Never again. This place is brutal 

Fire them all and start fresh."}
{"text":"Avoid this Taco Bell location like the plague!!!! Last night I went through the drive through and ordered 2 cheesy bean and rice burritos, one cheese quesadilla, and one cinnamon twist. The employee informed me the total was $6 and change. I pull a $20 from my wallet and grabbed the exact change amount to get a clean $14 back. The employee takes my payment and curiously closes the window and moves over to the front cash register for a while. He finally returns with my bag of food and I ask him for my $14 in change. He said I gave him a $5, When I Actually gave him a $20. Why would I have given the employee a $5 when he informed me the bill was $6 and change? Employee asks for receipt, I give it to him. Manager comes and says she checked the drawer and it's right. Manager does not return my receipt. I call back a couple hours later, talk to manager who still has my receipt, manager says the employee removed the cinnamon twists from my order, which brought the total to $5 and change, yet I still received the twists but not my $14 in change. Manager says the will review the video tape and get back to me. Watch out!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible. Apparently fast food in Bridgeville area are idiots. I am always missing part of my order and the part I get isn't what I ordered. I don't understand how hard it is to follow their screens it's all laid out. I never will be back to this one for breakfast or lunch/dinner. Spend the extra miles and go to the mcmurray location."}
{"text":"Everytime I have been here there has been something disgusting wrong with my meal to where I had to throw it away. 

My last experience was one day I was running late to work and knew I wouldn't eat again that day I stopped at Taco Bell and bought two loaded grillers. One of them had blue fibers in them like a rag or some sort of hand towel. I had to throw my meal away.


Another time I was grabbing breakfast and my food was old. It wasn't even warm.

Taco Bell is my favorite chain but I will never go to that location again."}
{"text":"Let me just say, I haven't been to a Taco Bell in over a year. After reading these reviews, I almost didn't come here. But, it's the closest one to where we live, so I decided to just go for it.

My boyfriend and I just left this location and weren't disappointed at all. We ordered just over $50 worth of food - that's a lot of tacos and our order was complete with no issues at all.

The cashier, Tyler, was helpful. Mind you, I hadn't been to a Taco Bell in a while. Although, not much has changed, there was a few new items. He explained a few of them, which was nice. (Not that there's much difference in the items.)

I'd probably come here again for my yearly Taco Bell meal."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru I have ever gone through. This happens every single time, but I'm Taco Bell obsessed so I keep coming back. I'm typing this review while sitting in my car waiting for my nachos. Literally been sitting here for 18 minutes and there's still four cars in front of me."}
{"text":"Empoyees super loud...   music playing is ghetto horrible..  food... well.  Its taco bell..   owner needs to visit in the evening..  pop in and have a seat and view the horseplay.."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service with consistent food. I feel like the quality here is a lot better then other locations that I have been to. 

The drive through is pretty fast but the girl who works there is super nice!"}
{"text":"The service at his Taco Bell is horrible. 30 min waiting in line for no apparent reason! They weren't excessively busy just lazy workers! Avoid this Taco Bell and find a different one. Finally got the food and it was the worst Taco Bell I have ever eaten. My quesorito fell apart and was so full of refried beans. The chalupa was soggy with grease. So disgusting."}
{"text":"Second time after a large void due to bad service.  Still feel like these Managers just do not drive the customer service concept through.  The Employees walk aroubd like we the customer are bothering them. The product Tacos were slapped together cheese n lettuce half on the taco n in the wrapper.  Just not good service all the way around."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru tonight at a smidge before 11pm.  Cars were waiting at the window to be served, yet we were told they close at 11pm? Ummmm, what? Their whole premise and business model is to serve the drunk, hungry, and otherwise clueless their forth meal."}
{"text":"Drive thru at this Taco Bell sucks!!! I have been sitting her for 20 min for only 4 cars. Just to get our orders taken it took 10 min for the first car...."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Taco Bell, if not restaurant I have ever been too. No management, or they don't care. Extremely slow, wrong orders, overcharging, no ice, flat soda, dirty tables, you name it, I have experienced it here, and I've only been 4 times."}
{"text":"Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo on Dobson and Southern. Typical taco bell food and service. Lunch is very busy at this location because it is within walking distance of MCC, Pima Medical Institute, Banner Desert Hospital and a gazillion apartment complexes. 
Parking is easy, but this shopping center is very difficult to get in or out of during rush hour."}
{"text":"Typical TacoBell, except the employees are super nice! The drive through can be slow at times but my order has ways been right. Food always seems fresh and not sitting under a salamander being kept warm all the time."}
{"text":"By far the saddest Taco Bell out of the chain. Take forever getting your order and I never had a perfect order. Always had to go back to get it corrected. Please look at having at least one competent employee working the window."}
{"text":"This taco bell is hit or miss. A lot of lolly gagging goes on in the back. They get my order right mostly but the employee turnover is alarming. Today's experience the register girl was sucking her thumb, a grown woman mind you. On a positive note, one of the few taco bell locations that will still make an enchirito and a tostada. Plenty of parking available but clientele is often hostile so at times I've left at lunchtime in a hurry. Bathrooms are hit or miss. I've been in here dozens of times as I work around the corner. This is not a high volume location."}
{"text":"Wow, really poor lunch spot. No one was manning the front counter, it took about 10 minutes for a taco and burrito. Only a few tables were dirty, but it felt worse that the employee on break in uniform and apron couldn't do anything because they looked short handed. I have seen better Taco Bell locations in my days."}
{"text":"Came around 8 pm, and it took over ten minutes through the drive thru. Long wait for the box too. My order was correct on the screen, but it took a while at the window for four items. I ordered a loaded potato grilled and instead got some beef chalupa of some sort, but I got everything else. My empanada was pretty soft and my spicy potato taco was lukewarm when I got it. Doubt I return, it seemed pretty bad based on that service interaction."}
{"text":"Here's my theory on the enchirito.

Bob, the marketing director at Taco Bell was someplace else that day, a million miles away as he pensively doodled at his lunch, fork in hand.  
He had an ominous task ahead of him...come up with a new product and fast!
After all, It had been some number of years since he and the team jackpotted-out with that seven layer burrito.
He needed something new. 
Something different.

Time slipping away, he continued to mindlessly needle at his lunch...on this day a number two; the enchilada and bean burrito.
And that's when destiny came calling. 

Holy Shit he thought to himself, snapping out of his daydream. I think I have something. 

        \"Wait a second....somebody..SOMEBODY RUN AND GET ME A PAD AND 
         SOME PAPER...I'VE GOT SOMETHING, THIS IS BIG PEOPLE, HURRY!\"
       
Bob indeed had something.
All that poking at his number two had managed to combine the burrito and enchilada into an unrecognizable mass, and that's when the gods, copulating at that particular moment, shot a wad of inspiration directly into Bob's uniquely undersized brain.  

         \"We're going to call this...are.you ready... .THE ENCH-IRITO,\" he exlaimed
          proudly to the marketing department.

There were cheers and wild applause from the team. They knew Bob just hit another jackpot as he had so often done in the past.


Well, you know the rest of the story, another star was born in the Taco Bell line-up.
Way to go Bob. (and whoever ran after the paper and pen) 

This is all just a theory, based on a set of postulates including a spork, beans, cheese, a tortilla, and an entire marketing staff, optimistic they'd hit another home-run without a Spanish speaking Chihuahua.

Tip: If you're sick of everything on the menu, try a bean burrito with green sauce. It's not on the menu but TB will make it for you just the same.  
It looks like snot so don't look at it and get all freaked-out.
Just eat it.
It's tasty, kinda hot."}
{"text":"This store is just terrible! The customer service is awful' you pay for extra toppings and you dont get them! The tortilla is always hard and stale! The meat is cold! I just continue to have a terrible experience then when I complain they tell me to go online And complain and I do that and I never receive a phone call! I don't want free food I just want them to fix this store!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this one many different times as it right down the street from my house and it is on the way home from school. I love taco bell; however every time I go to this location it is like there is something major wrong. 
At first I thought that it was because I went during an off time, I used to work at a Taco Bell in CA and know that food only stays good for so long and during off times you will end up with the end of the containers or you will end up with gross old food.

So I did not write a review because it was just my timing. I waited and went at a busy high traffic time; and still was not happy with the quality of the food.

Every time I order the soft taco supreme they are always like wet and stuck to the wrapper, with the meat soaking through the wrapper. Thought at first this was me because it took me a whole 10 mins to get home; so the last time I actually just drove out of the drive-thru and sat in car and looked tacos they were already like that; I order mine special so that they cant use the premade stuff; yes as employees we would pre-make some of the most popular items to make it easy to give out, like the soft tacos; pinto and cheese.  

The beans on the nachos every time where cold and so gross! I am just wishing that they would pull it together because it is on my way and super convenient when I want something before I hit home."}
{"text":"NOTE- 5 stars for a fast food place, not the Phoenician.

Thought this location deserved an updated review, in light of the current ones posted.  

Been twice to this location in the last week- once eat in with my kids and once drive through.

Both time, our orders were accurate.  Everything was very fresh and seemingly prepared moments earlier- taco shells crunchy, hot things hot, cold things cold.  Lettuce fresh and crisp, Mexican Pizza bubbling with heat.   

The staff on duty this Sunday afternoon were friendly and sharp.  while we ate our lunch, I noticed that on two separate occasions, someone came out to wipe tables and check trash.  No complaints here. 

I have a theory- with the Fry's Marketplace (sharing the same parking lot) recently remodeled, there is a huge draw of traffic to this location.  Perhaps the Taco Bell got their act together so as to not lose easy business.  No matter the  reason, they appear to have pulled it together nicely."}
{"text":"How hard can it be to get 2 proper taco supremes and 2 proper burrito supremes? Got our take out order home and they were plain. No sour cream, no lettuce, no cheese, no tomato. Same exact thing happened at the S. Braddock location and at a location in Atlanta, Georgia. Bad work Taco Bell!!!"}
{"text":"Out with the old and in with the new.  The eye soar that was the old building has been leveled and replaced with a brand new facility.  It's shiny and clean with the style of TB's newest concept.  The menu has all the usual suspects and their \"Happier Hour\" features $1 specials every day from 2:00pm-5:00pm.  Recommendations in case the powers that be are reading:

The ladies room needs a mirror, coat/purse hook and a baby changing station.  It's the little things that make life easier for Customers.  :)"}
{"text":"This is the full-scale taco bell location closest to CMU.

what else....

it's a taco bell! besides from trying to confirm that i was out of my mind when i ordered 10 doritos locos tacos and a locos tacos box, the staff here are friendly and make great taco bell tacos."}
{"text":"Very good Taco Bell and Open late, I ordered chicken burritos and bean burritos which were small but tasty. Candy freeze was very drink good ."}
{"text":"I was hungry on Thanksgiving Eve and came here and got 3 shredded chicken burritos and 2 bean burritos everything was cheap and fast . The food tasted good and service was friendly. It is Taco Bell not fine dining so I recommend this location."}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill!  I used to love going here but this location has seen better days.  When you walk in, to looks like you are walking into the late 80's/early 90's.  The place is visibly dirty even though I was one of the first customers of the day for lunch.  The chairs and tables are starting to rust and the paint is peeling on them.

I placed my order and it never came.  Turns out they forgot to make it.  They did offer me any menu item for free because of this though, that was nice and I picked a churro.

The food was not so great, it looked like it was just through together and it was not very warm either.  I will say one thing though, that curro was amazing!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Taco Bell in a while and boy have I been missing out.  Check out the new sauces; besides Mild, Hot, and Fire, there are Verde and Fire-Roasted Peppers.  The Verde green sauce is a delicious touch to taco bell food, and the Fire-Roasted Peppers sauce was rockin'!  I covered my XXL Chalupa and enjoyed a Grilled Stuft Burrito like always.  Mmm...Mmm...Mmm...

Taco Bell + Delicious sauces = Heavenly food coma, and maybe some gas! 

=)"}
{"text":"I can't believe what these guys just did to me. I asked for chicken taco's with a hard shell - they upcharged me for each taco. I ordered the 12 pack - it came to 24 bucks. Really? You guys ought to be ashamed, you certainly lost my business. I just moved 4 minutes away - fool me once shame on me... never again. You're dead to me steel creek taco bell."}
{"text":"Idk why people keep saying it's really slow, I got my three items in literally less than 3 minutes even though there were two cars ahead of me. The staff is also very friendly. Definitely one of the better locations!"}
{"text":"Zipped thru the drive thru last week for some of those yummy Doritos tacos and one of the $1 watermelon (I think that's what it was) drinks. 

Service was fast. Tacos had lots of shredded cheese which I haven't seen at Taco Bell's in YEARS! 

Tattooed guy was all smiles as he quickly handed me all my artery clogging treats and sauces then I was on my way lickety split. 

Those tacos were so good. I stood in the kitchen and at all three of mine without ever sitting down, LOL!"}
{"text":"(+)
- doritos locos
- chalupa

I love chalupas so we stopped by randomly to grab a quick bite to eat. It was a weekday afternoon and the place was totally dead, only one other customer there. Decided to try the Doritos locos as well and it was good but my sauce totally overpowered any Doritos flavor.

Quick, cheap, tasty meal."}
{"text":"Two stars for this location, ultimately because of the poor customer service. The food was good as usual, but the cashier Sheri C. was abruptly rude straight from get go. My brother and I came through the drive through this Easter Sunday. \"What can I get you\" is how we were greeted, no hi, hello, or friendly context. We asked for two regular double decker tacos with no tomatoes. Her tone was really rude, and instead of just saying OK, she became argumentative about tomatoes only coming on supreme and not regular so no tomatoes come with that. We were going to order drinks but she just ended the order by giving us the total and saying pulling to the front. When we got to the window, she asked if we wanted sauce and we asked for fire, but she gave us mild. When I handed her my card to pay she turned away and came back asking for my ID and said \" there's been a lot of fraud and you don't want that to happen to you do you??\" in a smart tone. She practically dropped the food in my lap instead of handing it to me...and then just walked away. Overall, it was just a weird and awkward experience. As much as I love taco bell, it is not worth coming back to this location to be treated like dirt or an inconvenience in fear that Sheri C is working."}
{"text":"Think they were smoking weed inside lol. waited alongside another gentleman for about 30 mins on food and they put his food in my bag. Not to mention that was his second order because of a mess up. Stood at the counter for a long time while they all stared at me."}
{"text":"Very clean. Including bathroom. Very courteous associates.
Will be back here to eat in the near future."}
{"text":"OMG this is the last straw for this place.  Went to the drive through, the worker dropped my change on the ground, I opened my car door to pick it up, she screamed at me \"THAT'S STEALING!\". WTF!?!?!"}
{"text":"Quick service. The employees actually seem happy. Bathrooms always clean. I prefer this Taco Bell over others because their outside deck is huge and shaded. 

Lower the price of limeade and I might actually get one."}
{"text":"Where to start?! I used to spend my teenage years working the drive thru. So much fun!! So I know what's in the food, I know how it's made... And that right there should be enough for me to know better than to eat there, or let my kids eat there!! 

That said, it's cleaner than other Toxic Bells, the drive thru is always busy and they are fast - which is a good sign, because that means the food turn over rate is high. I try to stay away from the mystery meat. 

It's Taco Bell after all. If I wanted real Mexican, I'd go to Chevys! (lol) anyone who sits and writes out a \"real\" review, get over it. ;)"}
{"text":"Slowwwwwwwwwww. Ive been waiting 15+ min in the drive thru and it's always like this!. If you can go to a different location, i highly recommend. They also talk over you when you're trying to order."}
{"text":"The new LOCO Taco!

So I had to do it, I just had too. Me & my wife have a guilty pleasure, and it is the T-Bell! I don't know if it's from the first T-Bell taco that I had when i was 8 years old in Tampa FL with my Dad..(of course my Dad loved TB the tacos, they where 49 cents at the time), or if it was the years I spent hanging out in the parking lot of the Miracle Mile TB  in my young punk ass years. I love me some T-BELL. 

So I always try the \"new\" item at T-Bell, even though we all know it's the same food in different combinations. Okay, enough rambling, the LOCO. I found it very enjoyable, I mean it's what you thing it's going to be. A Dorito Taco, that's it! I prefer the supreme, but I can also spoon feed myself a tub of sour cream.

I have to make a special point to say that last night could have been the best Nacho Bell Grande I ever had. Me & the wifey always get the Bell Grande fro the ride home. (like McD's french fry's when your a kid). So kudos to the crew at the Forrest Hills TB last night. I don't know how it was so much better, but it was.

JEDI RECOMMENDS:

* Loco Taco
* Volcano Taco
* Mexi-Melt - (though they are falling of the list fast, price goes up, size gets smaller)
* Grilled Stuffed Burritto
* Cheesy Beefy

I know, I know, but I love me some T-BELL!

{"text":"People. This is fast food. It's also REALLY DELICIOUS fast food. 

Anyways, my order always comes out correctly and the food is always good. 

Services is fast and the employees are nice. 

I always go with a #10 or the burrito box."}
{"text":"Stopped by Taco Bell that clearly has Open sign lit up, around 2:55a. Pulled up to the order box and 'Idai' (her name) said they were closed. I asked 'isn't this place open 24hr?' She then replied 'we close at 3' A car right in front of us ordered their meal and she gave them no problem but turned us away. Also, there were NO cars in back of us. Not only did I have to wait behind the other cars till They got their meal, it is even more annoying that we had to reverse through drive thru just to get out. And as we left, we took a snap shot of the Open sign as it was past 3a at this point. I understand an employee would love to go home and shut their doors asap as I have worked in a similar environment but policy is you don't close until Closing time. but that's not good customer service and I would hope it had nothing to do with my race and hope if I come back, I'd be treated better."}
{"text":"Y'all want ten $ an hour but don't even understand the concept that granulated sugar does not go in iced coffee. Common sense is not so common huh?  Here let me put you on game. Sugar WILL NOT MELT in a cold beverage...you use SYRUP! That's what I get for ordering from Taco Bell... heading to Starbucks now.

Tacos bomb though."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Went there tonight and the guy taking our order would NOT shut up and let us order. At the window we literally saw our food and drink sitting there for a long period of time. The guy was shaking and was acting like he was on something. He didn't even give us a receipt and I did not receive the correct change. The freezes didn't even come with the right lids and we did not receive the correct sizes. They didn't even put in the right sauces, which should be the easiest thing to do since they messed up on everything else. They always usually forget one or two things but tonight was just completely not okay. I'm surprised the general managers would even allow such people to be hired."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the service is SOOOO slow.  This has got to be the slowest Taco Bell i've ever been in, and that is saying a lot!  
I am obsessed with the Grillers, particularly the chipotle chicken w/ added nacho cheese. . Mmm... now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I just arrived at this KFC to order some wings and the line was so long we waited 15 minutes to hear that they are out of wings. 

I said that's fine and requested something else, just to hear the girl tell me that they are out of all chicken. I decided to go for Taco Bell just to hear that they are also out of ground beef. 

I asked the girl why she didn't mention it before she asked me for my order and she said because they are getting ready to close. By the way, this was an hour before closing time. 

The drive through is so narrow that you have to wait for all the cars to go in order to get out. All the cars in the drive through left empty handed. 

When we drove around we noticed all the night shift employees sitting in the dining area chit chatting to one another. Might as well close the place down if they dont have the proper ingredients to prepare their food. If they don't have any chicken then what can I really order, their mash?

Avoid if possible!"}
{"text":"this used to be my most favorite location and they've just gotten sloppy. the past 3 times i've been asked for sauce and said yes and didn't receive any and i usually order a chicken chalupa without tomatoes, it's always rung on my recipes but they always give me tomatoes. just now i ordered a cheese quesadilla and i watched them press the set timer (only 17 seconds by the way) and only let it run for 3 seconds and take it out to bag it for me. i'm not in a rush? they weren't busy? i can surely wait 14 extra SECONDS for a crispy quesadilla."}
{"text":"There is always an excessive wait at the drive thru, and they almost always forget at least one item and/or napkins, so always check. I also went in an hour after they opened and the lights were off, and no one came to the front after I called out after five minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"such great fast and friendly service.. always a pleasure to come here and linda is always friendly and happy to help, thank you!"}
{"text":"So this is my regular Taco Bell because it is right by my place.. I have had good and bad experiences here, but the bad outweigh the good.. Tonight is one of many that my order was completely wrong.. Nothing is worse than not eating much all day and deciding to spring for Taco Bell and your food being made wrong.. I ordered a tostada and two spicy chicken tacos with no lettuce.. They all came with a ton of lettuce.. I absolutely hate lettuce and spent a lot of time picking every single piece off..to top it off my chicken tacos didn't even have the sauce that it comes with.. Not like anyone reads yelp reviews for a fast food place but needless to say I'm Disappointed:((((("}
{"text":"I currently deliver for PostMates and was asked to grab an order from this location.  I got to the order box, it was 11:30pm, 30 minutes before they closed.  I started to order and after the second or third item was told that they could not do anything g over $25.  I questioned it and was told that was their limit.  I said to continue with the order as we will not know how much until the end.  Then the shift manager comes on and tells me that she didn't say $25, but that they do not have enough ingredients to make everything and started rattling off what she had left, stating that it would take 30 minutes to cook anything if they could not fulfill the order.  I am sure it takes that long to \"cook\" bagged beans or bagged seasoned beef, and especially bagged shredded cheese and bagged shredded lettuce.  So I mention to her let's finish the order and she can let me know what she is not able to make.  Order completed, nothing was omitted.  At the end of the squawk box conversation, she thanked me for the inconvenience.

So don't waste your time coming in after 11:30 pm because you will get an argument about what you order, or be told they are closing early, which I believe is the final daily objective."}
{"text":"This location was recently renovated, it's much more modern and has a clean appeal. Every time we come it's empty never more then five people in. Which can be a good thing for us or a bad thing for business. 
Employees are all nice and make sure the food comes out in good time. On a side note: having to ask if you need a key to use the restroom and finding out that they have to push a button to unlock the door is a little off putting. I understand sometimes why companies do this but for one it's tacky to have to announce you having to use the rest room and must be annoying for the employees to stop what they are doing to push a button. Even though we laughed, it was a bit uncomfortable for my wife who dresses in boys clothes to indicate which restroom she like to use after being asked would you like to use the boys or girls restroom? ( I know everyone is making restrooms a big issue but she is not trans [we support ] she  is still a girl that just so happens to like to dress in boys clothes). Now on to the food : 

I came in to try the new nacho fries, I was sort of excited to try them built up from all the hype from both online and tv commercials. But sadly the tastes and flavor didn't hold up to the hype. I thought the fries would have more season on them and be more crispier. Even the photos of the fries look more appetizing.  If I were to rate the fries I would rate two stars"}
{"text":"I want to preface by saying that I was that guy that came about 3 minutes before close. Regardless of this I still received the best service I have ever gotten from a Taco Bell by a guy named Brent here. 10/10 will be back. Hopefully not right before close"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Taco Bell many times, but today their customer service was horrible. A guy took my order through the drive thru and while giving my order he asked me to repeat it three times while telling someone from inside the Taco Bell that their order was ready.. then when i got to the window he just put my receipt in the bag and gave me it - which is fine but had i received the receipt right in my hand i could have told him my order was wrong. I ordered two ranch Doritos tacos and he put it was nacho cheese - on top of that he used someone else's name to complete my order so can't even tell you who it was! Good Taco Bell, just triple check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"I don't like to write reviews for fast food but I feel that I must purely based on one person. Last night at about around 11:30 I drove through the Taco Bell in savoy and the woman working the drive through was the nicest and most efficient fast food employee I had ever seen. Kudos to T bell for hiring this lady. She was quick clear and even friendly. So often are we forced to deal with surely food service employees and this lady made my midnight taco run just a great experience. 

It's a Taco Bell man, I'm not really going to review the food."}
{"text":"Cheap fast food that you should not eat everyday - unless you want to get fat and have a heart attack.

Food quality at this location is on par with all other Taco Bell's. It is the service that sets this one apart. Orders are always accurate....and FAST. 

LOST STAR - I almost always use the drive-through here. But a couple of times I have eaten inside, the dining room was not clean. I hate having to clean up after someone else before I eat."}
{"text":"Chain fast food - don't eat it all the time you you will have problems. And, at a Mexican place... those problems don't always come at the right time.

Food is like any other Taco Bell. Service staff at this one is a little better than the rest.

TIP: Oh ya.... CLEAN Bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell and this location is clean, nice, and fast...although I am disappointed that they don't open at 7/8 am for breakfast like the ones by my apartment do. 

The ONLY drawback? They are currently suffering because of the lightrail construction. The whole area is a mess and will be for at least another year and a half or so until the construction is finished."}
{"text":"I go to this Taco Bell for many reasons: close proximity to work, I can have my lunch quick & still have time left on my lunchbreak, I like the vast selections of things to order from the menu, and the customer service here is very good. Every time I have been here, I have been greeted with a smile and with prompt service. Not once have they ever botched my order or made something not to my liking. 

I see the General Manager here each time I come in and he's even waited on me a few of the times! Very friendly and accomodating man he is. The dining room here is always clean and free of trash and dirty tables. The crew takes pride in this restaurant and it shows. 

I return because of all the reasons I first described in my review and I enjoy taking my lunch here."}
{"text":"Great service and food is always fresh. The person working the drive-up is always loud and clear and easy to hear. Always has a smile on their face and is polite. Rarely ever have I gone there and had them make a mistake on the order or leave an item out. This Taco Bell location is always clean on both the inside and out and well maintained. Their outside menu displays the items bold and legible so you can see what they offer and get a good description of it."}
{"text":"This location is quick and always friendly. I've never had a bad experience with the staff or the food. Great location and easy to get in and out of. 

When you're craving something fast on the way home, this is the way to go!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has never given me any problem and I have been her numerous times, only this was my first time checking in there on Yelp. 

Being the drive-up line was at least 8 cars deep, I went inside and ordered my items to go, as I was meeting my husband at his work for lunch and also ordered an item for one of his co-workers. I only had to wait about 5 or so minutes before everything was ready and bagged. Very friendly people work there and they are fast! The only thing that was alarming was the filter cover was off the front of the soda machine and looked like a large eyesore. I couldn't keep from staring at it. I notice weird things like that, and it just creeps me out!

Got the food to my lunch destination and everything was good, although the left the salsa out of one of the taco salads I ordered (found it later inside of my order when we were finished). Everything tasted great and was a nice break from our usual sandwich lunches we have every so often. 

I just hope the next time I step foot in there, they have their soda machine filter cover back on!"}
{"text":"Lunch with co-worker in between job installs. We had a very good experience here, as the staff were really friendly, fast with our orders, and the food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant on the inside, although I did notice the wall just to the right of the soda machine was held up by fluorescent green duct tape. Weird. 

Service was excellent, despite having to wait a few minutes longer than I expected for my order. John was very polite & courteous. 

I will visit this location again in the future, especially since it is close to home."}
{"text":"Exactly What You Expect

First, the food is Taco Bell food, so nothing to go crazy about, the food is exactly what you expect. I have  never been served cold food, and the food is always hot and seemingly fresh.

However, this Taco Bell deserves mention because it is by far the best managed, with the best
 staff, that I have encountered in a fast food restaurant.

The staff working at Taco Bell are friendly, courteous, helpful, and polite. They came around and ask how your meal was, if you need any hot sauce, or if you want your tray removed.

This Taco Bell Restaurant is very clean, the staff is always checking and keeping both the dining room and restrooms clean. I've taken by nephew here a few times in the past, and it is consistently good service."}
{"text":"This location has been improving. The service used to be horrible here, and I hated going here, but now, this is slowly becoming my go to location.  Great job management!  Cleaned up your act!"}
{"text":"Love taco bell chalupas. This particular location consistently smells really bad though."}
{"text":"Two times this past summer, we stopped for breakfast. Here's what happened:
1. Teenager sitting on the curb by the door tells us the manager never showed up and she couldn't get in, so they are closed.
2. Just closed. No humans in sight.
I sent an email to their corporate headquarters. I'm hoping they received, cuz they sure as hell didn't bother to respond to it."}
{"text":"Last name: Ever; First name: Worst...they have dry beans...my cousin had big chunk of beef with his Cantina bowl...the service was so slow, it was like being back on dial up speed than dsl...drive 5 miles to find the other Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Was super excited about trying the new Naked Chicken Taco. I went through the drive thru, I couldn't understand the cashier because he was talking extremely fast as while mumbling. When I got to the window ise greeting was, \"Wassup Brah\". Excuse me, I don't know you as well as it's extremely unprofessional. My Naked Chicken Taco was disgusting, cold, hard, and tasted as if it had been fried in week old grease. My Doritos Locos Cheese Taco was cold and soggy. I'm not even going to stomach the 3rd taco. To top it all off there was a wait in the drive thru. If I'm going to wait, my food should be fresh."}
{"text":"There is never any consistency with each visit.  Some days the order will go smooth and everything will be right, but most times something isn't right with the order. On multiple occasions when I order an extra side of sauce the soufflé cup has a wimpy amount of sauce in it. If I'm paying $0.25 for EXTRA please don't act like it's going to kill you to take care of the customer and fill the cup appropriately up. It's rather annoying to find I don't have that sauce I wanted to eat with, but instead a small amount to just take care of maybe one bite. It would be cool if they focused on improving customer service, because it's not fun feeling anxiety just visiting there."}
{"text":"I mean it's Taco Bell. The food is consistent and the service is eh. But hey, it's Taco Bell hahha. If I'm too lazy to make my own food then I'm not going to complain of my tacos take an extra 3 minutes"}
{"text":"I have asked for a variety if sauces and plenty. I get 3/4 sauce per item. Makes me sad when I have to eat Taco Bell with my own sorry sauce."}
{"text":"Ok. So it's Taco Bell. But I love this Taco Bell. I've probably had an item missing or an item made slightly not to my order twice out of bazillion orders. In general, I think that Taco Bell has made a point to up the amount of ingredients in their tacos, which is noticeable and appreciated. The staff here is always super friendly and just all around hardworking. I'll avoid an establishment if I feel like a nuisance to the staff, but the employees at this place are always smiling and polite. ILU Broadview Taco Bell staff."}
{"text":"Nice people. Always very friendly. Good food, never a complaint. Drive thru is super slow and they always for get sauce. :/"}
{"text":"The food is always excellent, but here is the #1 reason why I keep coming back, to this particular location:

BRIANNA J

She embodies the 4 Ps:  Perky, Polite, Professional & Pretty!

She's the Cashier, and the BEST one I have ever encountered, at ANY Taco Bell® location!

She made me feel like I was her favorite customer and she told me these exact words, \"YOU are why WE are here!\"

This company could not ask for a better representative serving the public, and you can bet that people like her will ALWAYS bring me back.

It is the EMPLOYEES who make a difference, with me!

I hope you are lucky enough to encounter her, when you visit."}
{"text":"We all know that this location is the worst location and has the worst manager and staff people who continue to cheat with baby portions and overcharge the customers.  They still do not serve steak in the Steak Nachos without sour cream, pico de gallo, crumbs from the tortilla chips at the price of $7 plus tax.  They only put about 2 tablespoons of refried beans on top of the crumbly tortilla chips.  Again the manager was so rude she wanted to make it right by giving me a side of beans with sour cream but no steak or pico de gallo.  You are not suppose to put sour cream on beans, I've seen other customers with cheese on top.  The manager is an incomprehensible female illiterate."}
{"text":"Not bad for Taco Bell. Happier Hour has great deals. Aura and Rose are two front end rock stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food's always been good, the service and speed is a bit more hit and miss than I am used to even for Taco Bell.   Also not pleased with the grillers being priced above a buck now.  I liked em at 99 cents!"}
{"text":"Don't come here with entertainment coupons printed from the website - they won't be accepted.  Yet they put coupons on the entertainment.com website again this year.  There are hundreds of locations to choose from, screw this one!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the sweet man at the register when I came back was so friendly and kind. He had such a sweet personality which brought me out of my pissy mood after I got home and saw my order was missing an item. At the drive thru the lady swiped my card and did not give me a receipt which was weird. Then she asked for my food back because one item had cheese(it still was disgusting), which was cool she corrected that before I drove off, but when she returned the food she basically shoved both bags of food back at me like she was upset. Super irritating experience. I will not go back to that location."}
{"text":"This is a great Taco Bell, very clean and accommodating. I don't eat meat and they were very easy about making anything on the menu with beans instead of meat. The food is fresh and very clean which is important in fast food."}
{"text":"Yes, a two it's a fast food joint that's been around as long as I have, just about. It's a typical fast food chain. Food fast and warm by the time you get it home. This one happens to be not so busy for some reason."}
{"text":"At 4:08PM I submitted my mobile order. I walked into the store a minute or two later. There were 3-4 people in line already. I take a seat and listen to every persons order come out wrong. At 4:28PM I asked how to cancel my order because 1/3 of my lunch break was wasted standing in line. At 4:37, a manager told me to call 1-800-TacoBell. I called and they said I'll get my money back in 3 business days. 

They could literally staff this store with special needs chimpanzees and they would be more capable than the sorry excuses for employees and managers that this store has."}
{"text":"This taco bell always takes forever. Pulled in the drive thru with two cars ahead at 2:08 and i didnt get out until 2:26"}
{"text":"This location is inside Village Square (Autozone & Regal cinema share this plaza).

Our cashier Nik was a great listener and held eye contact when taking our order.  The restaurant was clean and had recently within a year been remodeled.  It's laid back southwest theme.  The staff here has always been kind and courteous towards me when I visit.  I have yet to have my order messed up but even if it happened, I would politely ask for it to be remade. I loved the options for the $1 menu but I chose the limited time Nacho Crunch without red strips. The food came out hot. The dining area was squeaky clean thanks to Nik.

I would return here because I love the service we've gotten numerous times. Everybody has a big smile at this location which makes my experience and my day.

Didn't wait an eternity for the food,  unlike the Rainbow & Russell Rd location."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago because we were starving and wanted tacos. The person behind the counter was cheerful (for a change)!  I started with a Cheesy Gordita Crunch no hard shell only flour tortilla, and my boyfriend's Mom ordered a hard shelled taco & we both had Cherry Kick Starters for drinks being that it was Happy hour!

This location is hardly ever clean when we walk in because the teens from the high school tend to come here for the free wifi & a bite to eat. The bathroom is LOCKED if you have to go make sure you ask someone to open it FOR YOU. : | I hate that about this location.   The one on Warm Springs is right by the Sierra Vista High & it's super clean.  Not to mention they don't lock the bathrooms on you.

Well all in all it was a decent improvement from the last time we came in and were treated poorly.  I have to say this is an A-OK rating because it wasn't spectacular service.  The food was HOT & FRESH. I hated the Mountain Dew Cherry Kick start, made me sick to my stomach a third of the way into it, I threw it away after getting nausea.  I will just grab a Fountain drink next time. : )  You live you learn."}
{"text":"3/25/15. Stopped in on our way home for a fast, cheap solution.  $2.36 for two soft tacos.  Guy calling my order by name too. What a sweetheart, nice to feel better than a number.  I love my tacos grilled since I no longer can enjoy the Gordita Crunch my favorite (I can't have the corn shell).

Still doesn't stop me from the occasional fast food."}
{"text":"I like this location for being cleanly.  I used their bathroom here and even easy in here.  Today I was not happy with my ($2.89) queserito being burned.  It tasted awful. My boyfriend had their new chicken chips and he said they were crunchy surface was delicious.  We had their Carmel apple empandas for dessert which put me in a better mood.  I knew I should of Went to the Brazilian place instead, it's in the same Plaza..."}
{"text":"This place was clean compared to some I have been to recently. They didn't mess up my order, and the cashier was nice.  Good place to grab food after work."}
{"text":"The service at this location is always good but honestly I only deal with the drive thru since I have a 30 min lunch but this post is mostly about how amazing the new Sriracha Burrito it was the best thing Ever!! A serious must have!"}
{"text":"Register service was so slow and the clerk was surely and unfriendly.  My last visit here for sure."}
{"text":"For being a Taco Bell, this is by far the best chain I've been to. Super fast drive thru, accurate order every time. Workers actually look clean and engaged, fast and friendly. Have been inside as well and fairly clean."}
{"text":"the absolute worst taco bell ive been in the drive thru line for over 40 minutes ........ will never come here again!!!!"}
{"text":"When you leave reviews about any kind of fast food chain there is really only so much you can say. What makes a difference between the locations you visit would be the obvious.. Customer service! I'm not huge on fast food and if I'm ever checking into something like Taco Bell is because I have some hungry nieces or nephews that day. On this particular night when I visited this Taco Bell location there was a crazy line and that's expected especially on a late night weekend. I have to commend this location for the amount of time they were able to clear the cars out! There is nothing worse than sitting in your car stuck in between other cars hungry with no place to go. Not the case on this visit. Taco Bell is always running some kind of ad or have some deals and tonight was the $5 box. I think this has become pretty common across all fast food chains to offer these \"boxes\" for $5. Order was correct and no complaints! The gentleman who was running the drive thru window was courteous and had a very good customer service skills. I hope he is working on the days that they get those \"secret shoppers\" that like to visit and rate them, fortunately I'm just a YELPER haha."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell! I mean that as in you get what you pay for! It's fast food I mean there isn't nothing spectacular about it but I will say that when nothing else is open and you're hungry this place definitely hits the spot! I never really go inside but the drive thru can get crazy busy and the time to get your food can be insane on the weekends! Or late nights in general! I have no complaints because they've always got my food to me fresh and the employees working have all be pleasant! That's all I ask for when ordering fast food! Even though it may not always be fast the customer service never lacks and that's key! On a side note that new nacho crunch wrap thingy is bomb for $1.49 yaaasss! Can't go wrong ordering that!"}
{"text":"Just left this Taco Bell about 15 minutes ago with the incorrect order. Not only was the service slow but when I called in to let the manager Mark know that my order was incorrect he insisted that I drive all the way back to the store to get the meal replaced. Of course let's be honest how many people actually keep the receipts for fast food? I asked him about coming in the next day and he suggested that I keep the food to do so? Let's be clear here it's about principal and this is why I don't eat out to fast food places. Half ass food orders along with half ass a customer service people..."}
{"text":"The staff at this Taco Bell is always friendly and helpful when I stop in with my girls. They are picky about their order and what they want and these guys always come through."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! It was 4:45pm I literally waited 15 minutes to order food through the drive thru. Just to be told it would be another 20 minutes before my order would be made and all I wanted was a couple of tacos. Later I was told by my coworkers that this was normal everyday business for this location. Wow I guess I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great and food was good. Avoid the bathrooms! !!!!! There was feces smeared on the walls. The bathrooms were not clean in any way whatsoever."}
{"text":"I've been sitting in line for 20+ minutes, cars are ordering at the window and not the drive thru and even after I ordered it's taken an additional 8 minutes to get the 4 mini quesadillas that are $1!!! I'm so upset and annoyed with the service here the last few times I've come to this location .  Save yourself a headache and head over to Main & Country Club - never have problems with them"}
{"text":"So slow! !! Fast food should be fast....I don't know if they are short staffed or what, but expect drive thru to take over 15 minutes! ! Quality is on line with the chain but the waiting will probably prevent me from revisiting any time soon!"}
{"text":"Located in an awful intersection of boulder highway - and in spite of that I receive consistent good service and decent fast food. I haven't received bad service, bad food or an incorrect order yet. At this location I get  exactly what I expect from a Taco Bell restaurant."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great customer service. Bathrooms could use a little more attention, but other than that, great Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I had the worst customer experience with the team and management at this location. The night manager was rude to us caused an issue when there wasn't one. As a result the food we got took over 15 minutes and was soggy, messy, and didn't look right. One bite let me know I shouldn't eat it and we threw away $25 worth of food. I will NEVER, EVER go back here. If you look at the other posts, you'll see I am not the first to have issues with this location and it's team. There is a McDonalds a few blocks away that will treat you way better."}
{"text":"A couple nights ago I went thru the drive-thru and received the best customer service from a girl, I did not catch her name, but she had a very thick southern accent.  I had said light ice in my drink, and when she handed it to me she asked me to check it and if it was not right she would do another one.  I said it was good.  She was so nice I almost stopped to go and compliment her but I was in a hurry.  She was a very nice person, I hope they know what great service she is giving. Thanks."}
{"text":"This is the standard Taco Bell on the corner of serene and Spencer near the walmart shopping center. I normally get the chicken grilled STUFT nacho with extra chicken but when I went in the other day didn't have that anymore. This time I had to resort to a Crunchwrap supreme with extra chicken which was pretty tasty - not going to lie. The service was excellent and Miguel the server asked me how my day was going so I chatted him up for a little bit and got to know him a bit. He's in school he's interested in being an electrician. 

Another total bonus about Taco Bell is Mountain Dew Baja blast warning though It can be very addictive. 

If I had one wish for Taco Bell it would breed to bring the grilled STUFT nacho back since they discontinued it."}
{"text":"I'm never let down by Taco Bell, this time I was actually let up!! Yes I was! What's a fiesta potato bob for $2.49?!! Well, it came in a small container filled with fried potatoes, sour cream, and nacho cheese! I took one bite and blacked out after that! Seriously it was really stinking good! I also got my usual taco supreme which is just a taco topped with sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese! Cinnamon twists for my kids who said they tasted like puffy churros! Last, everyday from 2-5pm they have happy hour so I also enjoyed a regular sized Mountain Dew Baja blast icee! It was perfect, divine, and right on time! I was starving and really needed a quick fix and Taco Bell came through hence, a solid 4****"}
{"text":"This is the only Taco Bell right next to me. I've never had a problem with the taste of my food at all. There is a cashier that's very friendly and nice to chat with. The only thing preventing me from a five start is understanding what your order and order speed. Only once did I have my order take awhile to be served and it was served wrong. Don't be afraid to go here. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is pretty nice inside! The computers went down two weeks ago. The GM was nice and offer us water, which was nice thanks"}
{"text":"When someone orders 3 12-packs of soft tacos, I can't help be feel aggravated that the driver did not have common sense enough to order such a large order ahead of time, or go in and wait.  I could also blame the restaurant for not asking the person to pull ahead so everyone else in the line could be served.  One person behind me drove away because the line was not moving fast enough.  I wanted to, but I was stuck in the drive-thru lane.  Not great speed of service."}
{"text":"We have been waiting in the drive thru for 18 minutes. We are still waiting. There were only 4 cars ahead of us when we arrived. I wish I had kept driving. If you like Taco Bell, go to the one on bell, this one is awful"}
{"text":"This one is right across the street from me. 

When you're in the mood to run for the border this one is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch yesterday. Typical Taco Bell. Nothing special,. Food was okay."}
{"text":"Workers are great in this location. They know me by first name now since I go here every other week. Food is always correct and fresh. Been going here for 2 years and never missed an order."}
{"text":"Apparently they have a new dollar menu with some good food on it. I liked the new beefy Frito burrito a lot! It also looks like they hired some more people in there and everyone is super friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is what it, there is not much special about it. However, it has its purpose.  As it is a nice imitation of Mexican food. Plus you really can't beat the special deals they have going on. And this particular location is inside a KFC so you can get some chicken while you are here if you want. 

The hot sauce they give you here is a joke in my opinion, but I do have a high tolerance for spices. Overall now my first or second choice for tacos but in a pinch it will do."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Taco Bell. Sometimes, I just really crave Taco Bell. Anyway, they were open before their open time, and I went through the drive thru which was super fast! I'm not sure if it's cause I went a little earlier (but there was still a line), but this has got to be one of the quickest drive thru restaurants I've been to. And my food wasn't messy or anything. I will be back to this location soon!"}
{"text":"First off if I could give this location negative stars I most certainly would! I truly hate giving bad reviews, but I have given this location numerous chances over the years. I'm usually annoyed with them on how they continually forget one of my food items or a straw for my drink or when I purchased one of the Playstation food boxes and the code was already used (which they told me to go online to find free codes)...I continually just brush it off...what happened tonight though crossed the line. 
      After a long day at work, my wife called me and asked for me to pick up taco bell for dinner. I ordered a boss wrap, cheesy gordita box and 2 freezes...of course they forgot my straws again, but today I was smart enough to check the bag before driving off. Once I got home, we started eating and half way through our meal. My wife spit out her food. She said there was a worm in her taco and that the tomatoes were moldy. I looked and laughed at first thinking it was a grain of rice. She kept saying no! It's a worm...I'm never eating the again! I took a picture so II could see it more up close. In the picture you could clearly see it was a maggot...we could even see the lines through the little body. I was going to go there and show them, but realized it's not worth our time. The most they'd probably do it give me another infested taco. 
     On a side note about channel 13 squacking about personal reviewers possibly getting in trouble for posting their reviews I think is complete bull! There is a thing called freedom of speech (for now until it's taken away from us), also in situations like this where moldy food and insects are in our food...I think everyone has the right to know what goes on at these places.....the end..."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in drive-thru on multiple occasions, and the employees usually need to be reminded about the changed prices during Happier Hour. Many times half my order is deliciously fresh while the other half seems to have been sitting out for quite some time."}
{"text":"Food was poorly prepared. No older management on duty. Hands down the worst Taco Bell location I have ever had."}
{"text":"I always choose to drive past the ghetto TB at 4402 W Glendale in Glendale to eat at the nicer location at 35th and Glendale Ave in Phoenix. It's right next to QT. This location deserves 5 stars just on customer service alone!!! Someone I met that used to work at both locations agreed with me that things are run a lot differently in Glendale than they are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The average American eats about 30 lbs of fries a year. And now you can add Nacho Fries from Taco Bell into that rotation. For only $1 you really can't go wrong even if this snack is nothing more than regular fries with some seasoning and a side of nacho cheese sauce. Service here was quick but it is fast food after all."}
{"text":"I give this location 1  mainly because of the drive through cashier. Her name is Emma, the past 3 times she has been our cashier and she has NO enthusiasm or a single customer service bone in her body. Her tone of voice over the drive thru intercom sounds like she either has not slept in 3 weeks or is stoned. I would strongly recommend to management to let go of this person or put her where she is not interacting with customers. Especially since she is representing the company so poorly. She is the typical stereotype of a fast food worker. I would refrain hiring such low quality candidates and rethink recruiting efforts."}
{"text":"As good as any Taco Bell, watch drive thru orders! Only one right order out of last 4. They often miss the details. Napkins, sauces. Interior is dated but clean."}
{"text":"There was hair in my food I had proof and they refused to get my money back especially since i wasn't able to eat my meal very bad for service"}
{"text":"Went there this Saturday after the car show (6/9/18) at 10 PM. Just as we walked in, a very heavy set employee girl stopped us at the door and said \"we were just about to close\", basically telling us we couldn't be in there. I asked why and she couldn't offer any kind of explanation other than a dumbfounded look. I walked back outside and looked at the dining room hours, which showed they were open til 11 PM! I asked her again why they were kicking us out, and then she huffed and puffed and said \"I guess you can come in if you want.\" Really, lady? Really? There were about 5-6 other people in there already, waiting on their food, seated at tables. This is why I was really confused.

We left with our money and went elsewhere. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Pulled into the drive-through and had to repeat my order 3 times to a rather rude woman who finally got the order right but the screen wasnt updating from the order prior to mine so I thought I'd just pull around and correct it up at the window.  I wasn't upset or annoyed just wanted my food (I'd been fasting for blood tests). The woman handed me a Pepsi and I corrected her very politely with my original order request of coffee. She then proceeded to very rudely state,  \"I asked you if the order was correct on the  screen\" and bitch to herself under her breath while she completed the difficult task of pouring a cup of coffee. Some words were exchanged and she threw the Pepsi at my window as I drove away.  I walked in,  requested the manager and they all coward behind the counter.  I'm not sure if she was just having a bad day or what but I will never come back to this location.  There is a Taco Bell just down the street and I will go out of my way to give business there instead."}
{"text":"Once again I went to this location with the same results...they totally screwed up my order, I got a grilled chicken stuffed burrito, this thing was literally all tortilla and nothing else folded and burned into what kind of resembled a burrito. Garbage seriously tastes better then anything at this location. I have lost all faith in Taco Bell. SERIOUSLY NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really wanted a quick lunch with some soft shell chicken tacos...proceeding nightmare. 20 minute wait in drive thru, lunch break over. Thank you, yes I was late getting back to work. Truck in front of me...gets my order, order is manhandled by them, and at least 3 other people before I get it handed to me. Gross, food is ultimately squished. They are out of green sauce. I will never go back to this place. It is a joke, the staff sucks. Food generally looks like it was squeezed out of a baby's diaper and effectively probably tastes like it too. Always a wait. Complete joke. This place needs to close for the betterment of society."}
{"text":"Have to make a list for just fast food. This place is always an easy go to for some cheep not so mexican: mexican food. I still have yet to find a mexican pizza in a mexican establishment. Easy, cheep, good and drive through make this Taco Bell on of my weekly spots for a quick bite. I even tried the Dorrito Taco (meh not for me). I usually get the same drive through employee and she is always super nice."}
{"text":"Their taco salad shell is horrible! It tastes rancid, I don't know if they cook it in old oil or if the shells are old to begin with. I had to return mine, we couldn't eat them. They are repeat offenders on this."}
{"text":"How complicated is it to make a bean and rice burrito with red sauce??? I am allergic to dairy and I ordered 2 bean and rice burritos, no cheese, with red sauce and these idiots put the nacho cheese sauce on them any way! I've ordered here before and I'm sure it was a mistake or maybe not a mistake!,  but if taco bell is gonna offer customers food their way then they need to train their employees to be mindful of special ordering and customer food allergies! I know that is what I get for eating at taco bell but damn, it's just beans and rice, how much more simple can one get!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service that's been going down hill since it opened a year ago. Took forever to order, then another 20 min later still no food. That's when we realized THEY WERE SERVING PEOPLE WHO GOT HERE AFTER US!!!! No urgency to correct and nothing done to make it right. Instead they slapped together the food and threw it at us. They were so understaffed that they then LOCKED THE DOORS AND ONLY SERVED THRU THE DRIVE THRU!! At 1pm on a Sunday.... ridiculous and I doubt I'll be back. I recommend going to one of the other 2 fast food restaurants across the street before stopping here...."}
{"text":"Shitty drive thru service!! Asked for a Chicken quesadilla and got a burnt quesadilla with onions in it!! Employees need more training."}
{"text":"If I could leave a 0 rating I would. Service is friendly always, but that's all they ever do well. I don't know that I've ever received all items ordered when I get a meal for my family here. ALWAYS, there is something missing from the order even though it's on the receipt. A little more training on order accuracy could go a long way. Ask for sauce? Forget it!! More than 4 items, you're in jeopardy of paying for more food than you get through the window. Absurd service here."}
{"text":"This location is a hot mess. If you go inside to eat it's always messy. If you go through the drive thru you'll wait 15 minutes easily. The food is typical of Taco Bell. The service is just slow and they never offer an apology for being so slow."}
{"text":"Me & my wife decided to drive 25 mins to this Taco Bell. It was definitely worth the drive at 10pm! We were welcomed by the cashier Brenda who apologized for the wait even though it was only 1 min. She greeted us with her beautiful smile and pleasant tone. She took our order and we are difficult no matter where we go. I know we should stay home lol! She read our order back to us and it was correct and she smiled! Our food came out shortly after and she brought it to the table everything was hot and correct. The overall experience was worth it to be late night! This is definitely a Taco Bell I'll come back to and I will be doing my survey on the receipt! Thanks to this wonderful staff & I almost forgot how clean it was inside!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy review: 

Very clean place to eat. The price is quiet the catch too. And friendly staff. We usually come here just for a quick food and it never disappoint. The food is well okay, but it's ways better than MCdees. There's also seems to be more choices on the drink fountains. They also occasionally offer some kind of deals, free food and stuff. I will definitely keep coming back to this place especially for quick lunch/dinner.

A bit more detailed:

This place is a bit on a awkward position, tucked in on the corner of 51st ave. Upon entering the place it's obvious that the staff keeps the place Clean and dry. In my visits here, I have been greeted nicely and never been rushed not like when going to something like mcdonalds. They also have tons of fountain drink, they have mixed tea and a mango flavored drink! How awesome is that. Now with the food. I always liked their cantina and it has not disappointed me yet. The hard tacos are very good too. The only thing I can't seem to like here is the soft tacos. It's okay but not much. Promotions and deals are frequent check the mail or newspaper.

:) happy yelping!"}
{"text":"Worst service of any fast food EVER... More like SLOW COLD FOOD or NO Food. & it's what's worse- employees tonight were rude, manager on duty spoke no English. Ridiculous. Thought I'd give this location one last try, even though I had another bad experience there this past Sunday when they CLOSED DOORS & drive thru after I had been sitting in drive thru for literally 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I give 1 star because you can't give zero...horrible service, horrible food and how does a place so new already smell so bad inside?

Lots of issues getting simple orders placed and received. When I finally got my food, the girl didn't want to give me my receipt back. She said \"we keep receipts\". Um, no. GIVE ME MY RECEIPT SO I CAN REPORT YOUR POOR SERVICE. 

When I got to my destination, the food was horrible and did not taste like other locations. So trust, I shall never go to or recommend this location ever again."}
{"text":"Came to get my boyfriend and I food tonight & Stephanie said that this location did not serve green sauce. I had told her that the other location gets me the green sauce out of the back that you put in burritos, as I'm aware that you guys do not serve the packets anymore. After she had an attitude about me trying to nicely correct her about which green sauce I was talking about, I had asked for a water which she had in her hand and asked \"you got a water?\" I replied yes and she immediately closed the window without handing it to me which I thought was just her trying to be petty. I waited for about 5 minutes for her to come back to the window with my food and asked for my water. She proceeded to yell to the back of the kitchen \"I can't with her you need to come up to the window and deal with this because I'm not\". She then came back to the window and said \"we don't have water\". I had said yes that I ordered a water previously and she was so caught up in me asking for green sauce that she had to move from the window to go get, that apparently she thought I had said no to the water and then had the audacity to have an attitude and say that they don't serve water? The manager had to come to the front and give me a water because she refused to and made it seem like she acted this way normally. Absolutely insane. Will not be back to this location. Good luck going anywhere but minimum wage Stephanie!"}
{"text":"Check your food before you leave drive thru line. Got all the way home to realize they gave me nacho cheese, but no nachos. This is so annoying!"}
{"text":"I had just started leaving a TERRIBLE review reminding myself that the last time I was here I waited in the Drive-thru for 20 MINUTES!!  People were honking their horns.  It was RIDICULOUS!  But, alas, the 2nd car in front of me FINALLY left the window, the car in front of me got their stuff and pulled off.  When I approached the window, the young gal was very sincere when she looked at me and said, 'I'm so sorry for your wait.  Would you like a free cinnamon twist for the inconvenience?'. I couldn't leave a 1 Star after that.
This seems to be a consistent problem at this location.  WHY???  Can the employee NOT ask the person at the window to pull ahead and someone will bring their order out to them if that particular order is holding things up??
SERIOUSLY, find a solution!!  Staff is always pleasant, food is good and fresh, but after a long day at work, sometimes we just want to pick up something quick, eat it and relax."}
{"text":"It was standard Taco Bell tacos. I was craving tacos so I went there, since I happen to be in Brampton area and I actually had to meet someone in that plaza before noticing Taco Bell. My order was 5 hard tacos with bottle of water and the tacos were bland (just lie any other location) and their hot sauce is very chemical-ish. Over all 3 stars because I already knew what I was getting into before i walked in."}
{"text":"The new \"Chicken Chalupa\" aka chicken shell taco looked really good in the ad, so I got the meal for dinner. Even though the rest of the meal (1 hard taco, fries and drink) tasted as usual, the new Chicken Chalupa was disgusting. It was like biting into a pile of salt. Don't waste your money on this new item unless u like having salt for dinner."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this place and go thru the drive thru I seen to some how end up missing food and or get the incorrect order. I can understand the occasion mishap and or accident we are all humans and make mistakes however I can't overlook the fact that this happens every single time. I've brought up the issue with the manager on duty however I continues to happen. Unfortunately this is the closes location to me."}
{"text":"The bottom line is this: if it's not on the menu here, then it's not really Mexican food.  I eaten in Guadalajara.  The food at Taco Bell tastes exactly the same.  Nachos, tacos, burritos... The flavors here are a culinary journey south of the border.  And the little señoritas who take your order are not bad either."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Too bad the staff is too busy during a slow period talking about \"hoochies\" to clean the lobby..."}
{"text":"If there is a Taco Bell that would benefit from two drive thru windows , this is it. Their drive thru is always backed up.   Food is ok, employees friendly."}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service and got our \"to-go\" order wrong so we had to go back inside. They didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"I think they are trying to kill people because they ALWAYS undercook everything . I mea. How do they undercook fake meat and undercook a bean and cheese burrito? ?"}
{"text":"Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in one. The cashier was quick to get us through the long lunch rush line and got my order without a long wait. Unfortunately, I asked for not beans and they put it on, even though it was listed on my receipt. When I took it back, I feel the grill skimped me a little on my ingredients when they remade it and they definitely don't know how to fold a burrito correctly. Lobby was dirty too."}
{"text":"The kid at the drive thru tonight is either an idiot or an asshole.  This is the second time I ordered the same exact meal and both times, my order was messed up by the same kid. I asked for a grande meal with half hard shell tacos and half bean and cheese burritos and 4 pinto and cheese cups.  I was asked three times if I only wanted bean and cheese burritos.  I explained that I wanted half and half on the grand meal order. The kid said \"okay\". I looked at the order screen and for the bean and cheese burritos, he subtracted onions and red sauce. I've been eating Taco Bell for many years. Every single time I've ordered bean and cheese burritos, the red sauce and onions came on the burrito.  Not sure if this is a training issue or not but I kindly asked the kid to put the onions and sauce back on my bean burritos. When I got home with my order, unsurprisingly, my order had soft shell tacos.  Are you freakin kidding me??? After telling the kid that I wanted hard shell tacos three freakin times.

The other thing I've noticed is how this particular Taco Bell will (possibly intentionally) push in the bottom of the pinto and cheese cups.  When the bottoms are pushed in, they can fill the cup halfway and give the illusion of a full cup of beans. All four of my pinto and cheese cups were pushed in at the bottom.  I'd imagine that these cups come packaged the same way other stackable cup come so it's pretty obvious to me that the bottoms are intentionally pushed in."}
{"text":"Being a sole parent, professional and a football mom. This location being close to our house. We frequent this location OFTEN. A majority of the time they are out of something. One time it was Mt.Dew. Another time it was medium hot sauce. Another time was large cups. Let's not forget the time they omitted items from my bag. I had to make another trip just to get my complete order."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell. Super friendly staff, order is right every time. I always have a great experience here."}
{"text":"I had two crunchy taco supremes and a two pack of cinnaballs - everything was delicious and lightening fast  awesome Taco Bell Experience.

Hospitality was 5 out of 5

Food was 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Honestly I only eat Taco bell when I'm broke, low on cash, $2 on pump 8 kind of broke. I never could eat the food unless I had a really strong drink afterwards, to wash away that strange after taste. Anyhow, the food is okay, I don't understand why they can't use real ground beef...okay ground beef without being laced with oatmeal, or why they can't at least cook the tortilla. The tortilla is actually the most annoying aspect of it all. That and how many sauces would you like = | lady enough to drown out the crunch of poverty please. Anyways back to the tortilla, the gummy texture really annoys me, I did ask them to cook it once and it made that burrito so much better! The tacos are fine. My favorite thing at Taco Bell is definitely the epanadas which have gotten noticeably smaller. I haven't had one with cold caramel in a while so that's a plus. So if you love it here great, its pretty decent at best."}
{"text":"Service was fast and they spoke english. Food was somewhat good but what can you expect from taco bell."}
{"text":"You walk in and the store is dirty, all the tables were dirty,, trash all on the floord....I asked for a rag but there was a uoung girl who offered to clean up....second, you can't help but see a woman with headphones on and a large hickey on her neck and to find out she's the manager??? I walked into the establishment with a customer and the same woman with the large hickey yelling back and forth with each other. Who wouldn't feel uncomfortable in that kind of place? I hope corporate steps in"}
{"text":"Good place for tacos of their take on 'em with great taste, I've been coming to this one all my life and it's usually good service and fast with what you expect from Taco Bell. The 1 thing I have to put on here though is FOR THE LOVE OF GOD would the franchise HQ PLEASE renovate this restaurant!!! It's older than I but holy smokes this building in desperate need of a make over from anyone! There's a lowes next door there's no excuse!!"}
{"text":"I decided to grab a quick lunch, the service was very pleasant and the food was incredibly quick!! It was completed by the time the cashier was handing me my receipt! Good quality food today! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and great service. Many fast food places, it's hard to nail both. The taco bell at sharon amity and central is closest to our house, but they consistently suck on the other hand (how do you run out of soft tacos and mountain dew? they're terrible). we don't even bother with that taco bell anymore. will only be returning to this location!!!"}
{"text":"do not go here!!!!  if i could give a 0 i would! this is the absolute worst slow cold taco bell in the history of taco bells.  unbelievable junk.  whoever runs this place needs fired asap."}
{"text":"Normally don't have very many issues at this one but I knew I should have checked my order before I left since the ladies working the drive thru where to busy laughing and joking then paying attention to the customers. Order soft tacos not lettuce. Get home. All have lettuce. Really.  Gross"}
{"text":"I ended up waiting 30 minutes for two items  only for my order to incorrect. Definitely am not coming back to this one. Extremely disappointed by the lack of professionalism in this establishment, the place appears to be run by children who don't know whats going on."}
{"text":"They were awesome and made tacos with love but now they throw them together without any concern for actually filling them up."}
{"text":"Well, let me tell you what!!!  Tonight the wife and myself went to ol Taco Bell.   The date is: 10-3-13.  Time stamp on receipt is 7:52pm.  ( we went inside because there was 9 cars....yes, 9 cars in the drive thru. )  We walked out with our food and get this.....drumroll.....8:21pm and a \" sorry for the wait \" for  us and the other patrons that had the same idea to come in. One person ordered just (1) five layer burrito and it took almost as long as we were standing there.  I could understand if a basketball team or baseball or large party ordered but, come on. Almost, well, 30 minutes to get fast food????  WTF???!!!   There was a total of 9 employees working well, some, behind the counter. Two in drive thru 1 working register and others trying to work the food station. You would think with that many people you could get everybody in and out in a timely manner!!  NO, not here.  Just like every other fast food joint they ALL CATER TO THE DRIVE THRU.  But, if you have 9 employees why not have half work drive thru and other half work the people that come inside ?? I'm just saying.  In my opinion, I'd be looking at the management.  That is the person running the show!!  If you can't manage a restaurant, then YOU shouldn't be working there!! I'd suggest going down the road about a mile and go to Del Taco. At least they know how to get the job done!!!"}
{"text":"A busy night a Taco Bell!
There seemed to be only 1 employee there and he didn't seem like manager cause when I asked for his name he seemed nervous 
I asked for his name for this specific review , all thought Taco Bell was packed!!!! And he was clearly trying his hardest to speed stuff up it still took a bit of time , but I didn't mind because he had such awesome customer service 
Josh is an amazing employee"}
{"text":"Went to Taco Bell for some late night cravings 
Although they were out of nacho cheese 
Rylie , the guy in the drive thru was very pleasant and entertaining employee , he had amazing service 
I am a gm of a fast casual place , So I know great customer service when I see it !
Good job rylie !"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is always a hot mess! 
No matter how many people are in line it takes at least 20 mins to get my meal!
Everyone is always moving at a slow pace and have no customer service skills what so ever 
Idk who has taken over the last month or so
But it's a reck!
I'm literally watching 7 people wait for
There food as I type this and two employees are sitting and talking to what seems to be just a friend stopping in 
2 employees are leaning on the counter doing nothing and 1 employee in the back doing everything , they have no control over there language and could care less about the customers , there are kids in the lobby and both employees continue to use Foul language in a volume we can all hear 
Who ever is in charge here needs to get there shit together fast!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food I received from this restaurant today is completely unacceptable. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The drive through line is always long at the weirdest times. I would not come here during a lunch hour because I may end up spending the whole hour waiting for my order. When I get up to the drive through window, I paid and sat and watched them make my order. It made me wonder what takes them so long. The servers were nice and friendly. My food was hot. But I really don't like waiting so long for \"fast food\". I love how you can really feed a whole family from their menu for less than $10-$15."}
{"text":"I understand that this is Taco Bell and not some nice sit down restaurant but the service and servers are horrible to say the least. I had a simple order. Paid thru the drive thru and brought my food home. MY mistake was not checking my order before I left as o was missing an item. Drove back and they said here is the lady that didn't get all of her order. They weren't even going to make me a fresh one until I said I would prefer a new one as that one has been sitting there for at least 5 minutes or more. Management needs to get their act together and train their employees to treat customers with a little more respect! There is no meat in this taco what so ever!!!! Sad you can't give them zero stars!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru in the morning. Tortillas were old and was missing an item I paid for. I dont understand how items can be missing with the place being completely empty. Maybe at a busy time, sure, its possible. I shouldn't have to check my order. Chic at the window was nice but wasn't organized. Won't be back to this location either!"}
{"text":"Most definitely have food poisoning from this location. Went yesterday night (Mon. 22nd) and haven't been the same since. I should have known. The food was luke warm and tasted off. I was hungry though and now I pay the price because someone didn't do their job with food quality control. Surprisingly, the drive thru was busy too. Anyone else affected, I feel your pain!"}
{"text":"Drove through this morning (6/11/2018) at 7:02am.. the first thing the lady says through the speaker is, \"we're not open.\" I didn't say a word beforehand, this is literally what i was greeted with. As a worker in the service industry i responded with a kind, \"Oh ok! What time do you open for breakfast?\" I shit you not, the lady told me, \"we open at 7, based off of our clocks we have 9 minutes.\" LOL what?? I obviously said thanks and drove off, keep in mind that i drove through at 7:02am. If someone is going to be so negative in their role and then straight up lie (I have an iphone, it tells me the actual time in OH..) then i'm not going to sit there and state that it's already 7 only to fear that they may give in and ultimately spit or tamper with my food..i know it's not likely but there were only two people there, one person inside and another outside smoking a cigarette so i don't think it's so far fetched to have this thought. Also, i was on my way to work, waiting from 7:02 until 7:10 is not an option for me as i cannot risk the extra 8 minutes to just solely wait to place an order..i love taco bell food, but this service was just a kick in the ass and a spit in the face..ultimately ended up driving across the street to dunkin donuts and will most likely continue to do so as i can trust that they'll be true to what they say."}

{"text":"Stopped in to try the new grilled breakfast burritos. The bacon had some flavor but but overall it was ok. The sausage one lacked flavor and meat. But this location was clean and staff was friendly. Better then most."}
{"text":"I am addicted right now. Everything is always quick and good. 

The girls love the cheese rolls and the chicken burrito and I second that, so we can literally eat for four for like eight bucks, really?? I know it can not be good for us but well worth it on occasion.  

Most importantly, what we always notice is how great the employees are.  Always happy and ready to help you out! That is awesome! 

Has anyone else noticed how small Taco Bells little sauce packets have gotten though? I always have to ask for extras because they just do not have the coverage they use to. Again thank you to the employees for always giving me a large hand full of extra packets! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Great cheap food for when you are too broke to afford anything else, this is pretty tasty and wont kill you're budget.I dont care about calories because I ride a bike, but it is pretty good.I am not a food snob, but I know crappy food, but there is non here.I love the dollar bean burritos, yummy!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is always on point. Last night the drive thru guy took our order in a spooky Halloween voice (it was Oct 31) and gave us all a great experience getting some late night munchies. And it's Taco Bell so the food was obviously heavenly"}
{"text":"Dear Taco Bell,

Please make you drive thru menu font bigger. I could barely make out any menu items."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I have been shorted an order by this Taco Bell.  I have not complained before, but I called the manager after I got home and she was apologetic and offered me a free combo meal.  That didn't help my lunch hour today at all.  The woman working the window thought she was so competent that she could get my order while she was taking another order over the order kiosk.  Well, she screwed my order up.  And, the car in front of me gave everything back to her while I was waiting, so she screwed that one up as well.  She needs to be retrained or fired.  I'm done with this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible like one of the reviewers got it right fire everyone, this place is a joke always missing something in our order"}
{"text":"I went to this Taco Bell on 11/25/16.  Good lord, what is going on here?  There was one other table of people in the restaurant & our meal took 9 minutes to finally come up.  The drive thru was not busy either, I don't get it. Then, part of our order was wrong.
The staff was incredibly polite & fixed the order.  The outside lights were not on either.  I've seen this before at this particular location & thought it seemed strange. Almost every table in here was dirty.  
It seems as though there's some hustle that may be necessary around here..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Taco Bell for many years. Lately the line has been moving so slow I have had time to make a decision to leave, after waiting 10-15 minutes already. It's not that they are busy, rather that the line may move one car in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I don't normally give fast food this high of a rating, but I was very entertained the other night when I pulled up to the drive thru.  The guy who took my order was beyond funny.  I told him he missed his calling down on The Strip.  And the other guy that was working the kitchen that night was just as entertaining.  They got my order correct.  And it was good.  Definitely some of the best service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here after work ordered two tacos and two chicken quesadillas through the drive-through. When I got home. I discovered that my tacos did not have taco shells. Called the store no answer no return call also they closed shortly after I left. Emailed my experience to Taco Bell. They ignored my calls and emails. This place is garbage. Even more so then the food they serve.  The manager needs to be fired.
I have gone here a few times where they did not have food properly in stock. The time before this incident they literally were out of hot sauce.

Drive the extra mile and go to a different Taco Bell or better yet any anywhere else."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in drive-thru and ended up with someone else's order. Had to go inside and it seemed like I was an inconvenience to them. While waiting for my actual order, the girl at the drive-they window was trying to deter customers by telling them they had a long wait time. Bad customer service all around!"}
{"text":"A very good Taco Bell. I've not had issues with my orders and have not been treated in anything less than a congenial manner. They're very prompt with the app orders."}
{"text":"I've used the drive thru, app, and gone in for food. I can count on one hand the number of mistakes I've had, which usually consisted of a miss $1 item or maybe the wrong meat (I always get ground beef, so the wrong meat is to my gain). Rarely have I gone in and not been greeted in a pleasant manner or encountered a lackluster cash register operator. This Taco Bell has been tops for me and I'm going to miss it when I move away in June."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to this location they mess up the orders and you have to wait forever. The management there is obviously not very qualified and cannot run a proper fast food establishment. I hope that once this location gets sold they actually hire better management and crew so that you don't continue to loose all of the loyal customers. The location has such a high turnaround rate that every time I go there are all new faces. On this particular visit I had to repeat my order of 2 grande meals (7 hard tacos 7 soft tacos, and 6 bean burritos) at least 6 times only for them to give me a messed up order I ended up getting 10 being burritos five hard tacos and five soft tacos. This is ridiculous and I do not feel like driving back up there but I will be sure to contact the district manager and the store manager and complain about this ongoing issue. I feel if they could actually keep staff around longer than a day or two, then maybe they could manage to get a order correct and not have to wait in drive-through for 20 minutes.........."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location recently remodeled.  It looks nice...clean and updated.  The staff here, those I've come into contact with, have been really nice.  Friendly at the drive-thru as well as inside the restaurant.  It seems like I've been here quite often recently.  My daughter loves the new Nacho Fries.  They're crispy but never greasy.  Try them!"}
{"text":"Worst taco bell ever. Bad customer service. Waited forty minutes in line at the drive through."}
{"text":"My burritos were not even hot. They tasted like they had been sitting out at room temperature. Slow drive thru line and the girl running the window seemed so unhappy."}
{"text":"Good job tonight guys.    Just picked up my World Series Doritos taco.   Lots of people but staff was quick and polite.     Thank!!!!"}
{"text":"So slow in drive thru.  Only offered compensation when I mentioned something about it.  Check your bags as they are not only slow but lack the ability to count.  Very friendly but I do not come to Taco Bell to make friends."}
{"text":"It's taco bell.  What can I say.  Typical fast food, very little portion size for the money.   Help is young, inexperienced and has no clue what customer service is.   Complete waste of money.    Go home to eat or skip the meal entirely.    Keep your hard earned money"}
{"text":"They are always nice here but they always forget to put the extra taco in the bag when you order a combo. Like wtf."}
{"text":"Every single time we go there late (within operating hours),  the system is magically down for the same amount of time. Almost like they just don't feel like doing their job past midnight..."}
{"text":"Way do you never have change? Also employees seem to have trouble with orders many mistakes"}
{"text":"I went thru the drive thru during the afternoon lunch rush and they were super fast, I only waited for 2 mins :)"}
{"text":"Fast food? Not here! 20 minutes, and food still hadn't hit the counter. I stuck it out simply to see if they'd get their act together. They didn't. To be fair, I asked the cashier what time she had on he computer screen. 20 minutes. I then asked for a manager. Manager was busy changing out the drawer and I never spoke to her. Understaffed? Yup. Under trained? Yup. Phone calls to be made tomorrow? Absolutely!!!!"}
{"text":"Keep it up, Toxic Hell.  I know the main reason I shouldn't go here is because it's NOT good for me... however this is NOT the reason. THIS PLACE IS SO SLOW.  AnytIme you think this time will be different, it WON'T. Do yourself a favor and go to Hyvee across the street instead."}
{"text":"This morning was not the best morning I've ever had, I went and had breakfast at Denny's down the street where my drink tasted old or dirty ? Either way it was yucky . So I went to Taco Bell drive through for a drink and the man asked how I was and I said alright and he was so polite and saw I was not having the best morning and he said my drink was on them , this makes my heart happy and I'm so thankful for this mans actions today ! I didn't catch his name and wish I did so I could mention him."}
{"text":"This taco bell is amazing at always letting you down.... Every time we go to this location our orders are either missing items or not properly prepared."}
{"text":"Great restaurant? No! Awesome place to find a cure for constipation? Abso-friggin-lutely! Get a 5 buck box, wait 2 hours and let the good times flow right out of your rectum like greased lightning. Also, if you like dating big nasties that work at Taco Bell, this place is the spot to be. On the upside they are generally nice and usually get your order right."}
{"text":"This is my Crunchwrap supreme with EXTRA cheese... well, that's what I ordered.
Literally LESS cheese and no sour cream. I'm almost speechless. I guess it's what to be expected from a Taco Bell. I remember why I don't go here now. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"So, I've learned to NEVER expect much from taco bell ESPECIALLY around Champaign County but this place... this place is even worse than the Rantoul taco bell, which is quite amazing. 
Let's just talk about today, shall we?
I saw the commercials for the new Nacho fries and wanted to try them. This taco bell is close to work so I chose to go there.
I purchased the Nacho Fries Box. The fries were literally cold. Not warm or luke warm but an actual chill AND they were all smashed.
The Doritos taco was crushed, the \"gordita\" crunch...the gordita tortilla was soggy and stuck to the wrapper and completely fell apart when I tried to remove it.
The cheese sauce was in a large container and there was literally just enough to cover the bottom of the container. 
Oh! The drive thru employee greeted me \"Ya, what can I get ya?\" 
Pathetic."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this Taco Bell and have to say we are so disappointed.  The service was bad. We are both patient people but 13min+ for carry out?

We were number 208, and after hearing 210 and on we started to look at the counter. A few minuteswent by. 12 minutes of waiting and the young lady up front shouts \"206\". We continued to wait. After 2 more minutes of waiting she yells, \"yalls food is over there\". Well thank you for telling us. Our order consisted of 3 double chalupas no tomatoes, a side of cheese and 2 steak quesoritos. When we went to the bag we looked and saw cinnamon twists (which we did not order).  The young lady explained it was \"for the wait\".  A kind gesture but neither of us like them.  When we got home we realized, none of the chalupas had sour cream like in the picture. I don't have the cheese that I ordered. And oddly, even though we said \"no tomatoes\" we mysterously have 1 piece of a tomatoe in each chalupa. Thank God no one is allergic or anything.  We both know you (Taco Bell) can do better than this."}
{"text":"I do not understand these negative reviews.  I eat here often - it is near my work - and here today with my son, who is a picky eater. He had a special order, which they got right, and very politely so!  The staff are all exceptional!"}
{"text":"The night shift was awful, cold food, a hair, missing food in order too. They need new management."}
{"text":"Seriously. I ordered one thing today around 2 with no line in the drive through. We were spoke to rudely to start. I ordered a bean burrito no cheese. It barely had beans in it so first two bites were only tortilla, middle bites yay (only) beans and the last disgusting bite literally was only onions. The lazy and/or low iq possessing person who made the burrito needs to get fired or given further special needs education."}
{"text":"I frequently ask for complicated stuff, like substitutions and hold this and that. The workers this morning were so nice about it and got my order perfect. The gentleman at the window this morning was particularly pleasant and double checked to make sure he understood me right. Thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"i went here tonight didn't get all my food in my bag and was given the wrong receipt. went back and the male manager was nice gave us what we didn't get and then we went home again. got home My smothered burrito had no sauce on it. one of our quesadillas didn't have chicken or cheese on it. so I called and the male manager laughed when I said I wanted my money back. So we went back up there and the Lady manager said she couldn't give us the RIGHT receipt, and couldn't give us our money back but she could remake all the food and add some things of our choice on. she was very professional and nice. not to mention there were other customers who came in and said they were missing things. Also the floor was dirty and the females at the drive thru were not doing there job correctly either! Also the male manager was rude and saying things about me and my family while looking directly at us. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"I don't come here because I want a gourmet meal.  However, when I want heaping quantities of cheap food - Taco Bell is the place to be!  This particular location is very consistent and the food is not soggy."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell in the area. Orders are always accurate, and usually quick. Food is of good quality, I've been to plenty of Taco Bells that had super gross food... Not so with this location."}
{"text":"Will never return to this taco bell ever again !!! 

I can assure you I'll never return to thisTaco Bell ever again. Today I was made fun of by an employee for my diet restrictions, it was so bad she even used her headset to tell the other employees about my \"weird\" order just to laugh in my face about it! She was too busy making fun of me and my order she messed up I my food and forgot to add guacamole and pico. Instead of remaking it she just unwraps the tortilla adds ingredients and puts it back on the grill basically burning my food. She then begins to blame me as if this was my fault because in her words \"you should of been more clear with your order\" when the receipt says exactly what I ordered. I have never been so disappointed dissatisfied and so turned off from an establishment I can assure you I'll never come back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped there today after work to grab a couple tacos,  asked for no lettuce on my tacos, waited 10min for said tacos and the retards in the back put lettuce on my tacos, what a waste of a good dinner"}
{"text":"I love taco bell, but this location i feel like a mediocre. The staff are great, but food preparation is not as good as the other location. The chalupa is serve with minimal meat and sour cream. The meat is cooked with less seasoning than the usual taco bell."}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins for our order to be eaten there. Drive through went 10x faster. Also awkward atmosphere, and of course lots n lots of blue hairs!! Go to the next one down the road."}
{"text":"The worst food ever. If you even think about going there you might as well wall into wallmart and buy yourself a TV dinner !!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered vegetarian to go and did confirm while leaving if it was veg .. But when I was about to eat saw meat in it . So so disappointed ."}
{"text":"This location for some reason does not honor TV advertisements such as the Cravings deal and such it's a dollar more than once advertised on TV and very slow"}
{"text":"Stopped by the drive-thru today about 4:00pm. She said hello and then stated they had no taco meat for the next 15 minutes. What?  Isn't that like a Chinese restaurant not having rice?  Good job by the manager of the place not keeping the restaurant up and running like it should be."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell/Long John Silvers is awesome! My coworkers and I frequent this location pretty often and we always get good service, our food is made quickly, and the workers here are nice. I'd have to say this is probably the cleanest Taco Bell I've ever been to. If I'm going to eat food that's kinda bad for me, I'd at least like to have a pleasant experience doing so..."}
{"text":"SLOW! I can't even call this fast food, the drive through takes a lot of time and dedication. I already told you guys that you're the slowest location out there so let's change something ok?

Take my $0.89 burrito out of the microwave and give it to me already, good lord. Staff was cranky on my last visit, imagine how cranky the customers are after waiting in line 19 minutes.

Come on guys......"}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE!!! Everytime I go they don't bag my cinnamon twist. Got me three times in a row. So today I kindly ask the kid running the drive through to PLEASE make sure they are in there. Once I get home I realize my daughter got her cheese for nachos but no chips. REALLY? So I go back up there and go inside. I ask to girl up front why is it they always forget to bag these items? She points to a heat lamp rack with nacho chips and cinnamon twist pre-bagged on it and says \" sometimes when they ain't on that rack we be thinking there out\"..........WTF?"}
{"text":"Walked in the restaurant and everyone looked at me like I was from another planet. Were too busy behind the register talking.  Decided to not even order and leave. Should've checked the reviews before wasting my time walking into this fart factory."}
{"text":"This is so ridiculous I'm so mad . Let me start off by telling everyone how I put my food order in and pulled up payed and the girl at the window handed me my bag of food.... I asked her if this was everything inside was good she told me everything was there , I drove home tired from work to sit down and opened the bag of food to see it was the COMPLETE wrong order ..... when I called back they told me they gave me the persons  behind me food...she gave me a refund and comped my original order .... that was nice .... until I get home and opened my bag and I had ordered the \" loaded nachos\" only to get this sad sad piece of shit bag of chips with a side of cold cheese. ..... I even looked at the chips and asked her these don't look loaded and she told me it was at the bottom of the bag this was extra chips they threw in.... well that was a lie . These people who work here are clearly retarded and no wonder they work here . 6-11-18 the 10 pk night crew are retards I don't recommend coming here at this time . Oh and when I tried calling back for the SECOND time they were not answering the phones . What pussys they knew they fucked up a SECOND. Time"}
{"text":"I just came by after the gym to get a quick bite to eat with my friend. We walked in and were greeted by Brittnie. She greeted us with such a joyous tone and she smiled so genuinely. She took our order and she even offered us a water cup after we ordered, which was unexpected for me. That kind of service there stands out to me and would make me want to come back here alone. The food was good and tasted fresh to me. All positive vibes from this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. Went to the drive thru late at night and ask if I can have a moment to decide what to order with my family.  The lady said okay and let out a huge sigh.   When they asked for what kind of sauce I would like I told her A lot of diablo and fire sauce.  Once we got home we only got a couple fire sauce and one diablo sauce.  I took it as a rude gesture and will no longer come to this location."}
{"text":"Good service,Imani Stewart was very, very, pleasant the food was out fast, she would make a good mgr.."}
{"text":"I am so unbelievably disappointed with my experience here tonight, not to mention previous visits to this location. We ordered our food on the Taco Bell app, when we got there, first they handed us someone else's order, luckily we checked and realized it was not our food. Then, after waiting for our online order we come to find out that they are all out of the rolled tacos (which I understand places run out of stuff occasionally, but it was an inconvenience nonetheless). So after choosing what we want to eat instead, the girl charges me for two drinks instead of one, and is reluctant to refund me after I let her know she charged me for an extra drink. Finally, we receive our order and take it home. Once we get home, we notice the cheesy potato burrito (that I have had several times before)is awfully small, so we open it and realize there is NO MEAT! When clearly the online menu states it was \"seasoned beef\" in it. That was a let down. This Taco Bell location makes the entire Taco Bell corporation look bad. If only I could put zero stars..."}
{"text":"The store opens at 7 am and there is no one to take your order and the person that is there doesn't even have those headphones on to serve you or to even let her know that there is some one in the drive through....what type of customer service is that?!?!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this location 1 star because they don't even deserve that. We walked in and we waited at least 15 minutes and the 3 employees which included the manager Leslie didn't even acknowledge us. They kept talking to each other in Spanish about something else and they even saw us but didn't even tell us \"we'll be with you in a second\" or anything like that. They just kept making food like we were not even there. After about 15 minutes the manager came up to take our order but by then we were so mad I just asked if she was the manager and walked out. She didn't even care that we walked out. She didn't try to stop me and ask what was wrong or anything. I have never ever waited at any Taco Bell without even being acknowledged for that long. Terrible service. Don't ever go there. That is the worst manager ever."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else. The drive thru wait time is 20+ minutes every time. Doesn't matter the time of day or the day of the week. Inside isn't much better. They ran out of napkins and just said \"sorry\", and offered no alternative . We used paper towels from the bathroom.  Are they not aware they serve finger food? Little to no training might be the problem, which boils down to bad management. I recommend driving the extra mile to Del Taco."}
{"text":"You better get here at least 30 minutes before they close or else you won't get served. Closed tonight at 10PM, walked up at 9:40PM and the doors were already locked."}
{"text":"Do you like fun size burritos? I certainly don't, which to my dismay is what I found when unwrapping my usual order: cheesy bean and rice burrito and a beefy Fritos burrito (grilled: best way to get your burritos). Normally I go to the Taco Bell on warner which is always solid, go there, but today lady misfortune led me to the baseline location. 

Now let me just say the young man in the drive through did a tremendous job, he provided great service. However whoever was working the kitchen needs to check themselves because they about to wreck themselves. Literally all of the Fritos in my beefy Fritos burrito were on one side. So you had the beefy side or the Frito side, there was no delicious intermingling of ingredients.

All in all it was a truly horrific experience, totally ruined my night and well, I'll never be going back to the baseline Taco Bell ever again."}
{"text":"This taco bell is super convenient and the only taco Bell even close but they still care about quality. it's always packaged nicely. the people are friendly and it truly is fast food. It's clean which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Couldn't seem to get my order right which is fine I get that it can be hard to hear but the guy couldn't even say thank you or have a nice day. This town was built on customer service, what the heck has happened to that?"}
{"text":"They take so long to make your order, I waited about 20 minutes and watch other people wait long as well. Not only that, they take so long just to mess up your order. Oh, and when you go through drive-thru, check your food. My order was wrong and I've called 5 times, still no answer. Is it that hard to answer a phone?!"}
{"text":"Wow the guy at the counter is a boss!!! Really nice and the food was perfect and that's saying alot cause I'm a picky eater and order weird stuff. Restaurant was clean and we'll manged touche taco bell!!!"}
{"text":"Always wait a long time at the drive thru, like... A loonnnnngggg time, but when you get the food, it's hot and it usually tastes good. 
I always get the Mexican pizza and they have never let me down. The other food... Meh."}
{"text":"this taco bell is always on it! my order is always perfect, service is quick, and the staff is super friendly!!! love it, it's definitely my regular"}
{"text":"Yep, still a train wreck. Last two times they've forgotten food items that were ordered. No consistency in the food either. One taco is stuffed the other mostly just a shell. I've given up on this place."}
{"text":"Quick cheap food a great eating place if your vegan or vegetarian! Customer service is great and their open super late up to 4am on most days."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for my food for over 10 minutes. Other people here are claiming they have been waiting for over 20 minutes. Not cool. There are a couple of unhappy customers. A lady just asked to get refunded and the food was out literally in 5 seconds. The service is super slow, at least they are friendly. May be they are understaffed? I don't know. The place is almost empty."}
{"text":"I swear to God the last few times that my fiancé and I went here, he threw up the next morning. Either he's pregnant or something's wrong with the food. 
I thought maybe he just had a weak stomach, until my sister worked there. It's so nasty and unclean in the kitchen, that I will never be going back. Corporate needs to come in and take control of their restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service quality. The person taking orders was giggling as she started \"welcome to Taco Bell\". Then I tried to be clear with my order and asked that it be repeated back to me at the drive through because of past errors in what I received. The server forgot to turn off her microphone and as I drive forward I heard a loud and exasperated \"argh\"!!! Very rude."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some grub after a visit to Lee's. I was disappointed to find out they no longer offer the Enchirito. Kee'erra was friendly and did offer a comparable substitution though. Overall it was right in line with other TB's I've visited. I will return."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite after a trip to the neighboring Target. As far as TB's go, this is one of the cleanest I've seen. The staff was friendly and our order was up in quick fashion. As I typically do, I just went with regular crunchy tacos. The others got Cantina Bowls and Nachos Bell Grande. My tacos were good and everybody was happy with their choices. All in all it was a good experience, however, it was so cold in there, my nipples could have cut glass. It was a nice break from the heat, but OMG! Basically, a four star experience, but the shrinkage forces it to stay down at three."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Not only did I order a SIMPLE meal, I asked for nothing to be changed or edited. The ill-bred staff that this pathetic attempt of a restaurant are not friendly and take their grande ol' time preparing the un-edible, soggy and cold pieces of mystery food. Not one of the three things I ordered were correct. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have a Pizza Hut attached. I got a pizza, came home, it was cold and rubbery. I live less than a fourth of a mile from here. Driving is literally a 1-2 minute drive. No excuse."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. I went in to order as the 2 times I've been to this location, they can't get it right. Well this time they got it right, but it was 1:55 pm and not busy. However, it took them 20 mins to make my small order. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I like Taco Bell..... This one however has messed up my order twice and the food was cold the second time. I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I've stopped here several times, and I must say that the service is always the same SLOW 
Waiting 15+ minutes for 3 tacos and a bean is absolutely ridiculous. Even though it is within walking distance I may choose to use my car to drive to another  location with better service."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from Taco Bell but it's my go to get food place when I'm on the run. This is by far the weirdest one I've ever been to. You run into the counter as so as you walk in the door so if there is already someone ordering, you are almost out the door. During the lunch rush There was one person working the register and the food came out super slow. There is a weird odor and it's full of the strangest clientele. A bunch of jugalos and what appears to be drug impaired homeless people. Definitely not a location I would ever go back into."}
{"text":"we ate lunch here yesterday and everyone left happy and full!!!! it was good!!1"}
{"text":"Gross how can anyone serve food from a pig pen! I would not feed my dogs from this nasty so called restaurant!  With employees acting like it was high school running all over the manager! This place is a health hazard with the back having food everywhere! Amd mike the guy on the register giving food away to his friends making paying customers feel like he was doing us a favor for taking my order!!"}
{"text":"I didnt get your employees name but bought about 10 tacos and asked for a lot of hot and fire sauce she gave me 3 hot sauces and didnt give me a chance to ask for more or if i needed anything else shut the drive thru window. I went through drive thru because i was in a hurry fyi . Yet i honked 3 times to get her attention and nothing. I had to go get off and grab my own stuff. All i remember is she has green gauges and blonde hair. Teach her some better customer service."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be reviewing a fast food place but this Taco Bell hasn't the nicest employees I've ever met! Every time I come here I look forward to seeing Hunter, he is always smiling and that is not very common anymore. So thank you Hunter for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Kudos for having the coolest staff ever.

I don't recall ever reviewing a fast food place, in fact now that I try to edit the category on yelp for this place, I realize they don't even have a selection for fast-food.   So why review it? 

I'm not going to mention the food so much, however it was good, as much as you could expect from a Taco Bell and Long John Silvers mashup - but who doesn't like some planks of white-fish along side a spicy chicken quesadilla?  I mean come on!

What I am reviewing is the STAFF... I've been through the drive-through a couple times and inside once... Until today I always was like.. many they're kinda friendly there.   Today was no different but I figured after 3 or so times I had to say something.

The people that work there, at least on the speakers and at the counter are really frickin happy and they're really nice and fun.  I don't ask for much when I go get fast-food but the \"Happy Guy\" as Julie M (only review before me here) makes the experience there fun.  You don't get that much anymore.

So to that kid and the other girl in the speaker box thingy... Thanks - and keep having fun and enjoying your job - I'm glad somebody does these days :)"}
{"text":"I actually enjoy this Taco Bell, because I've always seen cleanliness, friendliness, and quality meat! The soda machine was broken just one time, but that is not my concern as I dislike any type of soda (and not just the kind here, I dislike soda in general.)

But they are modestly priced and this is the place to eat if you're short on your dough or just want some Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"No aquafina, shit service. Employees were giving me sarcasm and demeaning addressing which was insulting and extremely unprofessional even for a Taco Bell. My \"supreme\" tacos had no sour cream."}
{"text":"Service was so so. Very slow though. The food was not so great. We order nacho fries no tomato and they just took it back and picked off the tomatoes. Order 2 orders of cinnamon twist only got 1 which had like 1% cinnamon on them. The taco supreme had about a cup of sour cream on it which made it impossible to eat."}
{"text":"Store# D212063 fast food??? I think NOT!!! I pulled into the Drive thru tonight at 7:07 pm and did not drive off with my food until 7:36 pm. Almost 30 mins for 1 order!!! 12 mins of that time was from when I ordered my food to when I drove off with my order! I knew that this store always took a long time to get orders out but, 30 mins?!?!? I could have gone to a sit down restaurant and got my food faster! I do not plan to ever return to this store again!!!"}
{"text":"Omg best Taco Bell ever. Awesome service from Hunter !!! Food is made right and line is always quick !!"}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell of All time!!!!! Literally every time I go it's a 20 min wait minimum"}
{"text":"Long line, slow slow slow service, and crappy portions, ice melted in drink - Very disappointed - stuck in drive thru or I would have left! You didn't even make the food worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I'd love to take Taco Bell's food, put it on a plate next to almost any Mexican restaurant in the area and see if people could tell the difference.  I'd guess not.   I've been to this Taco Bell what seems like a hundred times and have always been happy.  Even when they do mess up (very occasionally) they more than make up for it.  That's how you tell a business is well run, how they react to an error.   This Taco Bell gets an A+ for that."}
{"text":"So around 3 am my wife and I came to your location after looking up on yelp and seeing you guys were open until 3:30 am. To my surprise when we pulled up at exactly 2:58 am there was an automatic message saying you guys where closed.  At this point someone needs to get it together and either fix your hours on yelp and stay open to the time your stated you are. This isn't the first time we have dealt with this and I'm tired of it. I will not suggest anyone to go to this Taco Bell ever !! And I will make  sure I contact corporate."}
{"text":"I believe the whole store is staffed with drug users. Seriously. 

Meth users/ homeless people hang out outside. I've seen the employees acting strange on many occasions. I've seen them being picked up after shifts by very crazy looking people.

 Seriously..drug test asap !"}
{"text":"I could be wrong, but I think the last time I went to Taco Bell was in 1992. I have no idea what sort of demon possessed me and made me go here late Sunday night, but what in the heck. (Actually I stumbled across some food reviews on Youtube and those people made Taco Bell sound so good. THOSE PEOPLE WERE LIARS).

Reasons for giving a cranky two stars:
-I had to repeat my order several times in the drive through.
-For this being fast food there was a really long wait for the people in front of me and for myself. 
-My shredded chicken burrito was a hot mess with a pile of guac on one end and barely any chicken. Also, that red sauce on the refried beans is atrocious. 

I mean, sure, Taco Bell is nice and cheap, but apparently if you are not drunk then the food is a regretful experience. I need to seek some spiritual counsel, going to Taco Bell has really made me question what I am doing with my life. I've strayed so far from the path and I am ashamed."}
{"text":"Well this is going to be short. 
 My son wanted some tacos so we went to taco bell.

 What can I say it's a brand-new taco bell. It's always nice to eat in a restaurant that's new. Just what you would expect hot fresh and fast. Hasn't changed much some new items. Still the same taco bell. Quick fix for food"}
{"text":"This store just had a remodel and it's very nice! The last two times I went through the drive thru, I had the same young man help me and he is awesome. Great friendly personality, my order is always correct and he is always smiling. Refreshing when good service in fast food drive thru's seem to be a thing of the past. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. However, the drive thru wait time was extraordinarily long. I don't think they were short handed because the way the guy acted when I finally got to the window seemed like there was no rush, no apologies or anything. If I had to guess, I was the third car in line and I waited about 10 minutes to get to the window. Oh, and they didn't give me napkins. Didn't realize it until after we left."}
{"text":"It was about 12:45pm when I tried to order my food through the drive thru. When I was ready to order I politely asked if I could do two transactions, the employee Marco proceed to argue and tell me he isn't allowed to do that. Meanwhile I have been to Taco Bell and never have I ever had a problem with making two transactions at the drive thru. I don't understand how that could be a problem there was no one behind me inline till after we argued the concept for 5 minutes when by that time I could have already got my food!! That employee handled the situation very unprofessional and was rude to add on to it."}
{"text":"Long wait times at lunch even for a quick drink and taco salad.  Staff seems friendly considering it's location.  Since its newer maybe that's why speeds are not up to par.

23 minute wait to be the 5th car from the window.  Thank God I wasn't in a hurry."}
{"text":"They sucked at service we waited in the line for 30 min at least. There was only a few cars in front of us. I don't recommend this at all. The food was cold by the time we got it so I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is pretty much the clutch restaurant when I can't make a decision. I usually try every new gimmick food they add to the menu every few months. Recently I had the steak bowl. Was pretty good actually! Would recommend! It's a good on-the-go meal but I'd suggest getting a taco or something with it if you're looking to get full."}
{"text":"I would like to say that i do like taco bell the food is good but this morning was the worst experience ever i walked in and was never greeted i stood there for like 15min no cashier cause all she was doing was having a personal conversation with the person in the car at the drive thru window i left and came back and when i came back da second time it was like i was invisble and she wad still i got upset and left and didnt return i am so upset and disappointed all i wanted was a breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell I have ever been to! So good I'm not even ashamed to check in here. The people are SO nice and the food is fresh! FRESH AT TACO BELL. Fresh lettuce, crunchy taco, it's euphoric."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito or AM crunch wrap, both delicious, truly freshly made and not that expensive for breakfast. 
I don't know about the waffle breakfast taco, it doesn't look very good and I won't try it.
A GREAT idea Taco Bell, but I doubt that the workers there are too happy to be up so early in the morning."}
{"text":"The place was clean
The service was nice
The food was ... well it is Taco Bell. 

We had a few things for a quick lunch. I tried the beef enchirito and a beef griller. I loved the griller thing. Kid #1 had a combo burrito and #2 had a nachos with meat and cheese only. 

While the meal was fine the price was just right! That is why they are still around. CHEAP and QUICK."}
{"text":"We have NEVER had a togo order that has been correct from here. EVER

I am talking about 9-10 years worth..."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is good. 

Cheap
Quick
Friendly

Mary the older lady here might be the coolest person ever working in fast food. She is one cool lady."}
{"text":"As it goes this Taco Bell / Pizza Hut is just like any other Taco Bell / Pizza Hut.  Normally I'd only give this place 2 stars but this is our first meal back in civilization after a long day out hiking in the woods - and that gives it \"Manna from Heaven\" status.  One extra star."}
{"text":"Yup. It's a TacoBell just like every other TacoBell. Which, by the way, begs the question... Why are you looking at a review for TacoBell?

As they go this one is pretty new. Nice. Neat. Clean. Fast. And the people are nice. Better than the average TacoBell."}
{"text":"I know you cant expect a lot from a fast food restaurant but this one is so horrible that is deserves an equally horrible review. Our chalupa was soggy and wet, lacking the robust golden crunch that often accompanies this amazing dish. The highlight of taco bells chicken quesadilla is its crack like sauce mixed with moist chicken and rich melted cheese. This experience fulfilled no such desire. It was almost apparent that no chicken was included in our chicken quesadilla and that the sauce factory began their strike at 11:59 this saturday night. I pray that no other soul will ever have their hopes crushed in such the way that mine was tonight. God bless, and goodnight. 
P.S. omw to del taco."}
{"text":"Never going to this Taco Bell again. There was a chunk of thigh meat I hope came from the KFC side. I called and spoke to the manager and they don't know why I was upset. Hmmm let's see I ordered a shredded chicken quesarito that always has shredded white meat chicken. Idk it just really grossed me out."}
{"text":"This place is exceptionally hit or miss (usually more miss than hit, such as burning food and not cleaning the press before making your food so your food tastes burnt) but, tonight, I asked for a steak quesadilla and got a chicken quesadilla and I hate chicken. And the grilled potato wrap came ungrilled and in an extra large tortilla so it was a tortilla wrap with a dash of potatoes and a smidge of sour cream and cheese. I think we're through."}
{"text":"Used to be really, REALLY bad. But has gotten much better. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm writing this only in regards to the bathroom facilities, as the food is what it is.  To note, the toilet lid was covered in urine (which I suppose is inevitable) and the handicap rail and wall had feces smeared on it.  To top it off, both soap dispensers were not functioning.  When I brought this to the attention of the young man at the register, he informed me they were aware of the problem with the soap.  He then asked me if I wanted to drink a packet of Diablo sauce.  I told him using his bathroom was risky enough."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is located across from the Target.

It was not busy so we got a snack. There was no one inside. It tasted pretty good. They had regular fountain drink selections and tea.

Restrooms were fine.

There was a lot of available parking."}
{"text":"They made my order wrong (had made special request to a Mexican pizza) when I went through the drive thru.  When I realized at work that it was wrong, called them back.  Person who answered the phone said to bring receipt back and they would fix.  I was going to be at work 8-9 hours, but when I  went back, they honored my receipt and remade order properly with no problem."}
{"text":"Foods always good :) who doesn't live some  Taco Bell at 130 am lol.. Just make sure to check the bag. They forget small things sometimes. Over all good team over there. Highly recommend the cinnamon deserts"}
{"text":"Out of all the Taco Bell's that I have been to (admittedly, I'm a frequent flyer) this is my favorite location. My food is always hot and the customer service is always good. Unlike other Taco Bell's, they don't put my tacos in the bag upside down or burn my crunch wraps. So, a million thumbs up for them :). Now I'm hungry"}
{"text":"We only come here for the location convenience. The drive thru girl ALWAYS has a shitty attitude and she's rude when you're ordering. I've even mentioned it to the manager before. She's horrendous and she needs to be let go."}
{"text":"Wow. All I can say about this place. Zero organization. I waited in the drive thru for ten minutes without moving before I decided to come inside. At least I found out what the hold up was. The obese owner was ordering all her food and lecturing all the staff. Interrupted me 3 times while I was ordering my food. This was accompanied by the fact that I was the only person in line when I ordered. Three people followed in ordering also being interrupted and then left with there food before I did. This place is absolute garbage. If you think this is the proper way to run a business then more power to your ever failing establishment. I guess Taco Bell corporate doesn't do regular check ups on their franchises. When I left, the person in the drive thru was still there from when I entered. This place is trash. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Bring back Tropicana Fruit Punch."}
{"text":"Seriously guys? Gotta get it together.

Every single time I've come here around 7pm-8pm, there is a line literally all the way out into the next parking lot where that school is!! That is absolutely unacceptable. I don't know why they don't ask customers to pull around front if they are that backed up. It causes traffic problems in the parking lot because the cars leaving taco bell can't get out! 

They have messed up the order a couple times but other than that the food is good.

Customer service has been great though, they always apologize for the wait and rectify any mistakes."}
{"text":"Fantastic Doritos loco fury taco.  Quick service.  Simply the best around.  Thanks Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"I ordered two STEAK Chalupas on three different times and every time there is no steak! How do you mess up a steak chalupa with no steak?!?!? I also ordered two black bean burritos and they had no rice! Screw this place three times back"}
{"text":"Not impressed about how they filled their tacos.  Of all the years, this was the first where it looked like all they did was put a pinch of the ingredients into the taco.  It was a disappointment for the person I brought this to."}
{"text":"At least once every few weeks I must have a chalupa.  They are crunchy and meaty and oh so good with a little lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG CHALUPA! NOM NOM NOM!"}
{"text":"Nice to know I'm not the only one who has problems with this location. I will happily drive to the one on 67th and Peoria to ensure awesome customer service and correct orders. EVERY time I give 59th and Northern another chance I am profoundly disappointed. If you're going to charge people for things like sour cream and to sub a hard taco for a soft taco, then you should probably DO THOSE THINGS! Beyond disappointed with the service here and when I called to speak to the manager she told me I needed to \"call back or come in tomorrow to talk to a manager\". So you're telling me when I asked to speak to the manager and you said you were, you actually lied? Surprise surprise. Will NEVER be returning to this location, in fact it should probably just close."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has really stepped up its game since the renovation, but I was rather displeased with my wait this afternoon. They seemed to be under staffed and the people in the kitchen were very apologetic, but the girl taking the orders had a bad attitude and instead of helping the kitchen staff prepare orders, she went out of her way to appear busy in the dining area and just wandered about the restaurant. On top of my 30 minute wait, I found my order was wrong after I left. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"S L O W service yet consistent 

Many choices but just as I find something I really like, they take it from me that's a corporate decision though

Like their steak bowls"}
{"text":"Let's be real with ourselves. Taco Bell isn't cuisine, it isn't authentic. However, if you're a college student trying to study or if you're coming back from a party, this place is not too bad. The prices are fair, and the food preparation is usually pretty good at this location. The server staff is almost always nice. The only downside is going late-night on a Thursday - Saturday. If you try to do this, you're going to have a bad time. This is when hordes of people come to get food from one of the few late night places near ASU. The lines get long, the staff gets irritable, and the food drops in quality. Any other time that you go, you can't really complain for the prices."}
{"text":"Not authentic, expensive! Crap, poor quality, burrito boyz def hands down authentic mexican food. Save ur $ highly not recommened."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever asked for my money back from Taco Bell. After waiting 10 minutes with not a single car moving in the drive thru, I figured I'd go inside and get my meal in a jiffy. Wrong. I waited about another 30 minutes. Finally gave up and got my money back from the manager who could absolutely care less. No \"sorry\". Just a silent robot handing me some change.

Oh, and I don't think I have EVER gotten a fresh, hot, tasty item from this location. Anyone that has had fresh GOOD taco bell food knows what I am talking about. 

Dont waste your time here. You will wait a good 30-40 minutes for lousy food prepared by a staff who could care less."}
{"text":"Every time I go....HORRIBLE! Stale taco shells, hard uncooked beans..need I go on?

Stay clear of this Taco bell."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell I've encountered, sadly.  Perhaps it was just a bad evening.  The food arrived took forever to come out and it was not well assembled.  I'll give them another try, but they're on a very short leash..."}
{"text":"I'm going to go easy in this review, because I may have just caught them on an off day.  The restaurant was clean and the food was good.  However, thy were severely understaffed when I visited, which was at a peak time when they should have been fully staffed - Sunday at lunchtime.  As a result, I waited nearly half an hour for my food.  The queue behind me of people waiting for food was at least 6 people deep.  Then, when we got our food, we were not comped anything on the meal or given something to ameliorate the situation.  Just a simple \"sorry for your wait.\"  All I can say is \"sorry, that doesn't cut it.\"  I will probably not be back."}
{"text":"This is truly a five-star Taco Bell, I eat at them all over the country, I love Taco Bell food and Mexican restaurants, believe me when I tell you I know Mexican food for American Mexican this is top-of-the-line, although it's not a sit down find food restaurant they do an excellent job and excellent pricing, they are very clean and their service is wonderful, for someone to write a bad review on this place, Must've just hit it on a bad day or they just like writing bad reviews, I go there often never ever had a bad experience in the last 15 years and I do not know one member that works there,"}
{"text":"I stopped in and ordered a T4 meal.  Anyone who has used a Taco Bell combined with a KFC would know there's a T4 meal.  However this one is combined with a Pizza Hut (just personal pan pizzas).  The girl did not know what a T4 meal was so I had to explain that it's Taco Bell combo with the mexican pizza.  She said she didn't know of a T4 meal but ordered me the combo meal anyway, I said she should still know what a T4 meal was.  I went to the fountain and poured myself a Sierra Mist, it tasted like carbonated water with no Sierra Mist syrup in it.  I poured it out and got myself another type of drink.  I got the meal promptly and the the girl who took my non-T4 meal delivered it at the counter (I didn't think the order taker would also delivered the meal at the counter).  She dellivered it with a smile.  I ate the meal, it was not held together well, everything fell apart as I ate, it was a mess.  The next day I got the flu, I had the runs all day.  
  I do not know whether she sabotaged my meal but I am sick as a dog.  After reading the other negative reviews for this Taco Bell, it would not surprise me if she did not sabotage my meal (spitting in it or hairs or who-knows-what).  
  Please do not eat here until this place has had a safety review by the health department, FOR YOUR HEALTH."}
{"text":"I see this KFC/Taco Bell is already rated pretty low, which is no surprise to me after my last experiences there which span over years.  I am finally reviewing it and hopefully this will keep me away forever.
  
First I had promised myself that I would never go back, and yet I did yesterday.  This was after a few months ago when  I added a cake to my order that was suggested by the attendant taking my order at the drive-thru. I broke the cardinal rule of ordering via drive-through which is not to check your order before you drive off.  Yes, I arrived home and the cake was not in my order, a total waste of $5.  It's like just taking a 5 dollar bill and throwing it out the window.  Sure not enough to break the bank, but enough to severely piss you off.  At that time, a year ago, I promised myself I would never go back.  
  
Yet yesterday I had a hunger for some chicken strips, my son suggested this place.  I said any chicken fingers from any place would be fine but he wanted KFC so I gave in.  He spent $25 dollars on two chicken fingers meals!!!  If he had gone to Burger King or Jack in the Box, we maybe would have spend $14 instead of $25.  The problem is, KFC bundles their chicken meals (bone in or bone out) with piece orders with 2 sides AND NO DRINK IS PROVIDED WITH THESE MEALS!  So he orders 2 large drinks along with the meals which were 5 piece chicken finger meals, with cole slaw and home fries as sides that came with the meals.  I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND 25 DOLLARS ON TWO FREAKING CHICKEN FINGER MEALS!  
  
I am now going on a cruscade against this company and I will be writing them about this.  Plus here on YELP, I am reviewing every KFC within a 25 mile radius of where I live and they are getting one star (wish I could give 0 stars)."}
{"text":"The young girl who worked the drive thru her name is Karla, was very nice with me there was nothing but great vibes when I ordered through the drive thru on 1-9-18 at about 10 A.M. Very friendly and positive person she is. I wish I still had the receipt to write a review on Taco Bells official website because she deserved it. Not only that but the service was quick and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is NOT authentic Mexican food. Now that that's out of the way, they do have some tasty options. My go tos are the Nacho cheese Doritos locos taco supreme (if you love Doritos chips you'll love this), Mexi-melt, and the cinnamon twists. I would recommend to always order your tacos \"supreme\" (tomatoes and sour cream added) and to use one of their tasty taco/hot sauces. I consider this place more of a fast food snack place. It's connected to a KFC so it's a good destination if you have people in the car who don't want the same thing."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this location several years ago and it took a while before I was crazy enough to try it again. But seeing as it was the closest location to where I was living and was open late I did. The service can be a little slow at times, but the food has been back to being as you'd expect from Taco Bell (like it or not)."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner the other night because I was too lazy to cook. Ordered nachos no beans. When I got home I discovered it only had beans, being too lazy to go back I called. I figured they would replace the nachos the next time I was there. I spoke with Jody(manager) she was very pleasant. She said the next time I visited she would take care of it. I went back today and Jody went above & beyond to make sure I was taken care of. The team was also very sweet. Thank you Jody for making sure I was a satisfied customer ."}
{"text":"Fredrick R.'s customer service was what made the experience. Some people might think it's just fast food. I disagree, I came to Taco Bell on my lunch break. Sometimes my patients aren't always a very happy situation. So it's nice to break away from the office and see a smiling face for lunch. Fredrick was just that! His kind voice and smiling face makes me want to come back. I normally eat Taco Bell maybe 2-3 times per week. (It's bad that I can admit that, haha) Just due to my work schedule. Plus,Taco Bell is just delicious. lol! I usually frequent the location on lake mead here in summerlin. Their Freeze machine is always broken so I decided to drive to the location on charleston (which is a little further from my office). And I'm very happy that I did, I will drive a little further to have such a great experience. Great job Fredrick! You rock! My order was perfect, the sauce on the side was correct, i got my Baja Blast Freeze, perfect expience. I feel like often times great customer service isn't always appreciated, I hope that Fredrick gets all the recognition he deserves. You never know how much a smiling and kind manner could mean to someone! Have a wonderful day (:"}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague.  If you want to wait 20 minutes just to find your order is incorrect or to receive rude service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Still amazing! This gem is operated almost entirely by females and they are upbeat, happy, courteous and very, very nice. The feel is local and you can tell everyone loves working there (I think it was even the same people working there from our last trip to Henderson in December 2013 so they have low turnover).

Great job, excellent store - well kept and supplies always neatly arranged and full.

NOTICE TO HQ: VISIT THIS STORE AND REPEAT THEIR MODUS OPERANDI."}
{"text":"Just stopped there for a breakfast taco. As my order was taken just a few feet away two guys were standing on the food service counter using power screwdrivers above. This is not good to have people walking and working on the food counter. Plus some plaster and debris was falling. All while the clerk is serving customers.   I wonder what goes on in the back ?  Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever. Waiting for at least 20 minutes now. Watched several people behind me get their orders. Was told they forgot about my order then was told my order was cleared. Got my order and you would have thought it was made by 1st graders."}
{"text":"The worest vist to a taco bell ever, they just put are food on the counter and never called are name, why ask a name for the order if your not going to call it, we where the only people there.

The burritos where not warped right cause they feel apart."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell serves sub par food! the ice water tastes like someone spit in it and the tacos look like someone stepped on them. I did like the doritos taco though and ordered it once, was very dissapointed when I got a regular hard taco instead that was crushed!! Ack!!"}
{"text":"For what it is, this Taco Bell location is repeatedly the best food hands down. Whenever we go there the food is always hot, has the perfect proportion of toppings on everything and everything is fresh, I feel safe eating at this location. Another + is that you can dine in later than most other locations. 3a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Staff is always pleasant and quick with your orders."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a bunch on my way back to work after delivering some product to Sysco. They have always been consistent and the drive-thru service has always been quick and attentive. I don't think they ever messed up my order! This spot and the Westlake location are the two best around in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is the second time in as many visits that my order has been made wrong. Someone needs to tell the employees how to make beefy mini quesadillas and cheesy gordita crunches. They have Baja sauce or spicy ranch or whatever it's called now. I get it...it's Taco Bell. But come on. At least fake like you care about your job."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from New York and had a craving for Taco Bell. Ordered my usual crunch wrap and oh my gosh my taste buds where in heaven. This Taco Bell is better than a few taco places I've tried in the valley. Don't know why the ratings are so low. These people do Taco Bell justice. Get your fix at this spot."}
{"text":"Worst Crunch Wrap Supreme ever!!!  I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager, explained that it did not taste like any other I had ever eaten.  She asked me to come back for them to correct it.  When we got there she proceeds to belittle my nephew in front of other customers.  I guess she thinks calling customers \"Honey\" makes up for her rudeness!  If she is an example of Taco Bell management, they are in serious trouble!  Will not return to this location, ever!"}
{"text":"Went here at 1:05am on the morning of January 6, 2010.

The neon sign said \"DRIVE THRU OPEN,\" but nobody answered at the order speaker.  I drove up to the second window and knocked on it until some dude opened it and looked at me like I was going to sell him a fucking vacuum.  I asked if they were open, which compelled him to just turn his head and yell to the other guy in the back to come take his place.

When the other guy came up to the window I asked him why nobody answered the order speaker when I tried to order.  High as a kite, he looked me straight in the eye and said, \"Ohh, dats cuz I shut off my headset fo awhile.\"

He gave me a large water when I asked for one, which was great, but he didn't put the lid on all the way and I immediately spilled 10 ounces onto my crotch right before the big presentation.

This place needs to by mystery shopped.

Where's the oversight?  Whoever owns this joint is paying good money for the help to shut all the lights, untuck their shirts and smoke weed out back all night.  God forbid a customer of this 24-hour drive thru restaurant should interrupt the party.

Quit smokin' dat chronic by the grease dumpsta an git yo dumb ass back in da kitchen."}
{"text":"They have the SLOWEST drive thru I have ever been to and do NOT have good customer service! Never again! Avoid this location"}
{"text":"F O O D  P O I S O N I N G  A L E R T !!!Went to this taco bell on Fri Feb. 17th 2017 and ordered a few tacos and a naked chicken. All of a sudden on Sat. I had a fever and heart palpitations with severe diarrhea. Called 911 and was taken to the hospital. They said I had a virus and sent me home. For the next 4 days I was violently ill with a 103° fever and diarrhea every 15 minutes and on Thursday I started passing a lot of blood. Was rushed back to the hospital and after some testing they said it was food poisoning. Aside from some rice I made for myself on Sat the 18th the food from this Taco Bell is the only other food I had. Every time I go there late night there is either a ride employee or they get my order completely wrong. Now I have food poisoning to add to the list NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell I'm not looking for restaurant quality but the speed and efficiency of the drive through here is pretty awesome. I was surprised how quickly my order was completed. Every time I come here I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"I don't know when this happened but the staff is polite and friendly, the orders are coming out perfect  so thumbs up  for the That. So far 4  just want to see if they can keep it that way"}
{"text":"Standard Taco Bell with standard long waits. the main problem with this location is the drive through speaker is insanely loud you will probably have to cover your ears while the person taking your order talks."}
{"text":"ok so I understand you get what you pay for and fast food isn't 5 star dining but....


this visit to taco bell was horrible I ordered the box meal and my two tacos had a barely any meat in them I wasn't going to pay for a cheese and lettuce taco so I asked for more meat and she said she had to charge me so I asked for a refund 

on top of that we were in the drive thru a total of 15-20 mins worst taco bell experience ever"}
{"text":"Okay this Taco Bell has always been too slow! Please management open the first window because  your lines are wrapping into McDonald's. This has been annoying for YEARS."}
{"text":"The drive thru is fine. As for walk in FORGET IT . 3 chances and they screwed up big time. First time we forgave and forgot whatever petty thing happened. Second time, order was wrong . Ordered some stuff and a side of NACHO CHEESE. Put a side of steak and charged is for that instead . Had to return this flimsy pile of meat for our money and then had to repurchase the cheese. During this process the other guy is putting stuff in and out of our bag. Like a big black nacho cheese cup and takes it out to replace it with the plastic little one. Practically cheated us during the process. We lost money and poor communication among everyone.  This time girlfriend and I walked in. She orders first got her stuff while I was deciding. Next dude goes. I'm behind him and the order lady walks away as I go up. I stand there for five minutes and everyone in the store has their food and I'm waiting to order mind. Entire kitchen staff staring at me. I sit down with my girlfriend just waiting . Meanwhile some managers were chit chatting to our right in clear view of the issue. Girlfriend goes back up to hordes for me and got attention of a kitchen member. I myself refused to order because I was ignored. I vow not to eat Taco Bell. Taco Bell customer service will here my wrath tomorrow morning. BEWARE OF POOR SERVICE AND INCONSISTENT QUALITY"}
{"text":"I was hungry so we took a chance and went in here. We ordered and got the food to go. My partner told me the fountain machine wasn't working. So I stand  at the counter with the cup waiting. It was quite awkward and frustrating to watch all the employees dancing around in front of me (literally) and looking at me while as I  waited to ask to get a drink. So I went behind the guy ordering and waited in line again to get someone's attention. They realized that both machines weren't working for Dr. Pepper. After 5 minutes, they handed me a large drink and it was a combination of Fanta, Coke and maybe some Dr.Pepper. It was gross and of course the Fritos in my burrito were stale. Never ever again."}
{"text":"The only bad experience I've had here is that they seem to have stale nacho chips at night for their Nacho Supreme. Otherwise, give me a Chicken Chalupa Supreme and a Fiesta Potato Bowl or a Chicken Quesadilla or even a Mexican Pizza and I will shut the hell up!

Their soft taco supremes aren't bad, either; neither are their doritos locos supreme!
=)"}
{"text":"Rehydrated food taste like crap.  I could taste the dried beans in my mouth as I munch into the burrito.  They have a lot of crazy combinations.  I give him credit in one aspect that they've taken Mexican food to outer space.  This said they will probably be the first fast food to open on the planet Mars."}
{"text":"I've always had fast service and hot food. Also, I've come to conclusion that they went through a great & lengthy customer service training. This is the friendliest bunch that I've ever seen :) Thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"my friends wanted to stop here while we were shopping in N Hills. It wasnt my choice but i went with it anyways. I always order a crunchwrap supreme. Our order came out fine but they did mess up our friends order. Staff wasnt rude nor overly friendly."}
{"text":"I come here to eat on my break from work. I only have 30 mins and they 15 mins to make the food. They take forever to make the food and most of the times they will make a mistake. There's not sense of leadership here. No manager to help them or anything."}
{"text":"Always a long line inside and in drive thru. All of the workers are incompetent . The good workers they get always somehow don't work there long (probably for good reason, they're too good for the job). This place is terrible. My food order is never right.  Never coming to this Taco Bell anymore. Tear it down and put in another Starbucks. Save us the trouble!"}
{"text":"Always and I mean always a really long wait for your food even if it is something as simple as a single taco. The staff are all really rude and act like they don't even want to be there. They even have completely forgotten about my order while I stood there a good ten minutes and everyone of the staff members were walking around talking to each other and cutting up. Finally I asked where my order was to then be told that someone had erased it by accident. They didn't even bother to try to get right on my order either they still just stood around talking. If I would have not already paid I would have just walked out."}
{"text":"love the new crunchy burrito.. I think they put doritos or something in there, but it's very good!"}
{"text":"May King Tino rule forever!!! I've always loved taco bell, but this one by far is my favorite! and the reason is because of King Tino, he is so cool, he has multiple times gone out of his way to give me something for free, just for the heck of it! One day my debit card wasn't working and the guy at the counter said don't worry about it its on us."}
{"text":"This particular Taco Bell needs a swift sanitation overhaul.  The food all has a weird taste and the fountain sodas taste like mold .  Yuck :("}
{"text":"This location is pretty good. 

The employees are polite. They do surprisingly well with customizations(add avocado ranch sauce to the taco salad-you're welcome). Occasionally the lines will move super slow but I'm not sure how much of that is related to the employees vs other customers."}
{"text":"Food came out quick and efficient. Very yummy. Keisha was very accommodating and friendly best service I've ever had. Extremely pleased"}
{"text":"I've lived next to this taco bell for years and over the years they've struggled with getting a correct order and attitude problems. I will definitely never go to this specific taco bell and I suggest you save your time and energy and never go to this on taco bell."}
{"text":"I hate to be the guy who does a review on Taco Bell, but I have no choice. I live in the area, and have a weird schedule, so sometimes I resort to them for a meal if I'm in a hurry. I have been here 3 times over the last year, and they have got my order correct 0% of the time. Today was absurd. I go through the drive through and go eat at home. The only thing they got right was the size of the drink. That's. It. Ask for soft taco, got crunchy. Cool ranch taco. Got nacho cheese. Baja blast? Nope. Regular Mountain Dew. Even got the hot sauce wrong. 

I know it's not a huge deal. In the grand scheme of things, I will find a way to move on. But come on. I ordered the quesarito box and got a breakfast crunch wrap. And you want $15 an hour? 

If you want your order to be right, save yourself the hassle and move on"}
{"text":"I have no idea what goes on here but a) I don't think I can muster any more energy I'm trying to figure it out & b) trying to empathetically figure out htf anyone who sucks at their job can reasonably ask for a raise; $15 no way!!

Third time here and it's definitely the charm as I won't be returning!! Order is never correct & customer service is non-existent."}
{"text":"Slow AF! Just sat in the drive thru line for no less than 35 minutes for 6 tacos .  11 cars in line,  and the employees step out front to smoke.  Can't wait for Del Taco to open across the street here shortly."}
{"text":"These morons still can't get an order correct.  I was dumb not to check my food before I left.  It's an on going problem at this location.  I recommend you stay.  I know I will from now on."}
{"text":"Super friendly and fast. What else do we need to say? Head for this border, they'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"This is a good Taco Bell orders are always right, normally speedy on drive thru and friendly people work there."}
{"text":"Came here the other night, my son was starving and it was late... normally I wouldn't even think to yelp review a Taco Bell, but the person working the drive thru window was SO nice, it was memorable and honestly refreshing to get service with a smile. Got home and the food was perfect.  Win-win for a midnight drive thru!"}
{"text":"These guys are so fast I can barely unwrap my straw before I get my food! Food was very hot and tasty."}
{"text":"The fiesta potatoes are NEVER cooked all the way through.

One worker will literally hand us our bag through the window and just shut the door. Half the time we have to check to see if all of our food is in there or if we're waiting for another bag. No communication what-so-ever. No \"here you go!\" or \"thanks, have a good day!\" Just bag, and shut door. Unfortunately she works there a lot so it happens often.."}
{"text":"Just your average fast food place. I don't always get fast food, but every once in a while I get a craving for crunchy tacos. This time I also decided to try their Starburst Strawberry freeze. It's probably full of tons of sugar, but it hits the spot on a hot summer day. The woman at the drive through taking our order was incredibly friendly and personable."}
{"text":"We visited this location last night for a \"quick\" dinner after our kids activities. Not only did it take 20 minutes to get our food, only part of it was ready at that time and we had to wait an additional 5 minutes for the rest. Then I ordered a chicken quesadilla without the jalapeño sauce for my son. It was plain as day on my receipt but they put the jalapeño sauce on it, so then my son was crying because it was spicy. 

We were not the only people that had to wait a long time yet the drive thru continued moving. Clearly that's where their focus was. Not to mention there was a ton of conversation going on throughout where some workers were just standing around. This location needs a TON of training! 

I was also told that I would receive vouchers for something that were never actually Given. 

Never have I had such a frustrating and time
Consuming trip to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I always avoid this Taco Bell location for ONE reason only. They take way too long to give you your food it almost shouldn't be considered fast food.. Drive thru line is always the longest dreadful experience ever, if you ever have to put your car in park while waiting in the drive thru line it's too long of a wait. I can drive to the second closest Taco Bell from me and still get home faster then this one that's one mile from me."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is always empty and unless you search for it on maps-you'd never see it. I rarely see cars in drive thru,  so I tried it and the employees were very weird  food was more or less....questionable. 

Trim/remove some trees and replace the bored ghetto kids that \"work\" there and we might see an improvement. But honestly Location wise it  wouldn't be worth it. So just avoid that one and let the staff repel customers they hope don't come back while they get paid for just being there."}
{"text":"If you have 25+ minutes to spare waiting in line (while the drive thru is built so you can't escape) then it's fine if you want a rude employee to give you half your food. 
But hey, if quesadillas that are cold in the middle is appetizing to you then this is your place. I suggest driving the mile or two to swensons!"}
{"text":"I worked all day with nothing to eat. I passed by this Taco Bell and decided to stop in for a quick bite. 
I ordered a \"Doritos Los Tacos Supreme\". This has to be the best invention at Taco Bell ever! It was delicious. 
The store was clean and the cashier friendly. I didn't visit the bathroom.
I see they have a \"Big Box Deal\" that the cashier says changes each month.  This month it included the Doritos Taco and other goodies. I wasn't able to eat a big meal knowing I was going out to dinner in a couple hours or I would have tried that.
Hey, it is fast food and not \"real\" Mexican food but every now and then it really hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I went here last week for a quick bite late.  The food was not bad at all and my order was accurate, but I had to put up with the typical shenanigans that one may expect for a low-end fast food joint in a sketchy area.  

I went in and there were 3 people already there.  Two people had ordered and one was ordering while I looked at the menu.  After I ordered, it took a little while to get the food, so I made some observations:

There were two off-duty employees that were loitering there, bothering the staff that was there working.  One got some free food and went out to the parking lot.  The other came to the front counter and leaned to the left to call out the names of the kitchen staff and get their attention to chit-chat about nothing in particular.

One guy received his order but check it and found it was completely wrong.  He asked for plain on everything and they gave him the normal toppings that he didn't want.  They had to redo his order from scratch.

The person that was in front of me got the order and left, but complained that it took too long.

The last person was the one that was there the longest.  Someone asked him what he was waiting for and he presented his receipt.  They had NO IDEA that he was still an outstanding order.  This is very pathetic given how few customers there were there.  They had to make his order from scratch.

The restaurant is not filthy, but feels a bit grimy both indoors and outdoors.  I don't feel perfectly safe walking into this place, so I do carry a weapon.  I'd recommend everyone do that when getting food on Sunset Rd.  Heh."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot because I live around the corner. I love taco bells deliciousness and they rarely let me down BUT. There has been a couple times them they have gotten literally 3 out of 3 items wrong, but hey it's Taco Bell it's still good!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE... got home and they didn't give me my chips and cheese nor my cinnamon twist, And this is how my crunch wrap came. Your joking. Thank you tacobell you suck."}
{"text":"I like tacobell a lot. However this location has made me hate. Recently i moved here to tempe and started to give the stores around me chance only to get disappointed. The place is always dirty and takes a long time to get me food. When i get a burrito its always made so sloppy.. but to be honest when it is done correctly it is delicious and hits the spot after a long day of work. Im hoping they will do better managing the new building they are working on now."}
{"text":"Decided to go here since I wanted something quick and easy for dinner. I ordered the crunchwrap combo which came with a taco and a drink. Food was good, but the shell in the crunchwrap wasn't crunchy :(. The employees here are really enthusiastic which was quite a surprise! Friendly and awesome attitude is always a good thing. I'll drop by here again sometime and check out the other menu items."}
{"text":"The worst waiting time I have ever experienced. Slower then anywhere I have eaten I would NOT RECOMMEND coming to this place if you want a drive through meal. I waited 22 minutes with 2 cars in front if me for 2 burritos. So not worth the wait !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. The service is slow. Place was dirty all around. Had to wait 10min just for 1 soft taco. Workers need to speed it up a bit. The way the tables are sitting it there are too many people you have to sit where the sun hits you. They should re arrange the tables for the customers."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SLOW SERVICE!! They were semi crowded and lots of employees but slow.
I went inside because the drive thru line was long. I think the biggest problem with this location is that it is a Long John Silver as well. I overheard another customer getting pissed because they ran out of Tarter Sauce, I would be upset if I heard that as well. No excuses for that! My order was ok but the side of rice I ordered was only about half full."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell somehow managed to mess up literally every aspect of our order. I got three cheese roll ups - they didn't even attempt to melt the cheese. I got three cold tortillas with some cold shredded cheese tossed on them.  I ordered two chicken quesadillas with no sauce - they put sauce on both. I ordered two cheesy Gordita crunches -not only did they forget Baja sauce, but it was the saddest looking one I've ever seen. One splotch of barely melted cheese in the middle. To top it off, I asked for hot sauce. However, they decided to give me a truck load of mild sauce instead. 

The restaurant was not busy, and it took them at least 15 minutes sitting in the drive through to manage all of this. I don't hold Taco Bell to high standards, but this is pretty poor service..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Bell. The staff is great no matter what time of day you decide to stop by. I have had great luck with them always getting my order 100% correct even down the the extra sides."}
{"text":"Visited tonight and had the best service. The cashier was very sweet and service was very speedy. Everyone  seemed to like working there. :)"}
{"text":"Cleanest, generous and courteous Taco Bell this side of Las Vegas. In other words the BEST(on this side,haven't been North) !!although there are 2 in Henderson that can compete with this TB."}
{"text":"5 stars doesn't properly sum up my affection for this beloved establishment. While just a prepubescent teen I discovered the wonderful world of Taco Bell. It was a gringo heaven. All the delights of Mexican food without all the cow stomachs and germs. Wrapped in a beautifully soft flour tortilla that I could use to wipe my posterior if needs be. Once upon a time I did a fairly accurate fiscal analysis in regards to how much money I had spent at T-bell in my lifetime. Figuring that I've eaten there at least once a week for the majority of the years that I've had hair on my schmeckel, and extensive periods where I ate there nearly every day, I projected an approximate number that rings out at a cool $4,700. I don't know if there are any specific accolades for this fantastic achievement, my only suggestion would be that they come up with one. Until then, continue wrapping your mystery meat in those beautiful tortillas and fill them with your molten hot beans. I will continue to deep throat those burritos and spend the subsequent hours on the toilet, but I'll do it with a smile the whole time."}
{"text":"It's a standard taco bell. But, I have to say that the employees here are super friendly. They put up with a lot of noise and multiple orders from us - all with a smile. Our orders were done correctly. The food was standard taco bell fare - nothing to write home about, but it will do. I think this is as good as it gets for a taco bell."}
{"text":"Fast, accurate and (gasp!) SMILING service! This is a \"good\" taco bell. Its fast food, i know, but for what it is, at least the drivethru gets an a+ from me!"}
{"text":"Always get good service here though sometimes its a tad slow. The foods always made the way i like it too. Which is why i come here. Which is also why im the duchess :)"}
{"text":"Taco bell.  Don't get me wrong, I love eating spicy laxatives as much as next dude, but I'd prefer if my colon cleanse came from a cleaner kitchen...  This place always looks dirty.  Somehow it's damp inside.  Just gross.

Drive thru is the way to go here, then you can eat your shame alone while convincing yourself that the kitchen that burrito came from had to be inspected at some point... Right?  That's how that works, right?  Some guy, from some food agency inspects all the kitchens sooner or later...  I think.  I hope...  God what have I been eating...

Anyway...  This place is pretty gross, but it's what it is.  It's not like they're tricking you.  You know what you're eating is garbage, they're just the people shoveling it into you grabby paws."}
{"text":"Fast and FRIENDLY! Friendly is the key word. Hard to find a place that also has friendly staff."}
{"text":"The service was horrible the last time I was there, they messed up the order twice even after repeating it back to me and the shift manager was very rude about fixing it."}
{"text":"Locos taco is amazing."}
{"text":"We are here last night and my friend and I not got sick. Our chips had a weird chemical taste so we threw them out and as we were eating we noticed the meat didn't seem the same as usual so we got freaked out and threw the rest of the food out, but it was too late.. be both got sick to our stomachs, had the runs with an almost unbearable smell!"}
{"text":"Visited this location at 7pm on a Friday night. Asked for fresh chalupa shells as they have been terrible in the past. I was told that they are always made fresh. My mistake was trusting the employee, I got my order and headed home. Within a couple of minutes of driving and unwrapping them they were hard and stale. Called the store and was told if you want to come back we will replace them. With young kids it was not feasible to load everyone in the car just to \"try\" to let them get it right this time. The manager said, well that is all we can do, it you don't want to come back now we can't do anything else for you. Terrible service and even worse customer service to try and make it right. No wonder why this location has so few stars, guess it will be worth it to drive further to go to another location than have this location take the 2-4 minutes to fry fresh shells for the price they charge. Just don't ask for any special accommodations if you go here, you won't get it."}
{"text":"How the hell do you run out of beans at a \"Mexican\" food place? They always have something out or missing here it's a joke don't bother coming here go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Taco Bell aka \"Taco Hell\" brings back amazing memories from my high school days.  There was a Taco Bell located right across the street from BHS (my high school), and if memory serves, the drive-thru was open pretty damn late; maybe even 24 hours?!  At the time, my friends and I made many a \"run for the border,\" and I remember the food being great!

Either I was really drunk back then or Taco Bell has gone down hill or my taste buds have matured quite a bit since then, because after eating Taco Bell for dinner last night, I no longer \"quiero Taco Bell.\"  Or maybe I ordered wrong?

I'm quite nauseous thinking about what I ordered (and ate) last night:
-1 Mexican Pizza (540 calories / 30 grams of fat)
-1 Chicken Soft Taco (180 calories / 6 grams of fat)
-1 Pintos and Cheese (170 calories / 6 grams of fat)

I didn't know there was a \"Drive-Thru Diet® Menu\" until looking at their website just now either... oh well, I'm eating for two right now!

I also didn't realize the slogan changed to \"think outside the bun\" until actually listening to the radio commercials as I drove home with my food in my lap last night.    I will say that the drive-thru was super quick and my order was right and all for under $6.  What a bargain!

I'm sure Taco Bell is still a great option when you're out late, have had a few too many, and/or are eating on a budget.  But I don't recommend it when you're completely sober and it's a normal hour.  Probably not the healthiest option for the baby in my belly either... 

Bottom line: I don't plan on returning for many years to come, although I do have a pretty big high school reunion coming up next year, so I may just have to give it one more shot!"}
{"text":"One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to this Taco Bell and the service was absolutely awful. We ordered two soft tacos,2 nacho supremes, a freeze, and a medium mtn dew. The food was cold, the lids were not placed on the nachos containers, and the soft taco shell was harder than a hard taco. My fiancé called the Taco Bell and spoke to Ms. Dupree and told her the situation. She instructed us to come back with the receipt to get a full refund. Once we got there, we waited for at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged. Ms. Dupree was really rude and argumentive and only gave us $2 dollars out of the $13 dollar order we had. It took us another 15 minutes to drive back to Taco Bell to receive $2 instead of the full refund we were promised! This was the most pointless drive. Do not ever go to this location. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever. Horrible customer service and HORRIBLE management. Ordered a XL burrito with no tomatoes and they put tomatoes on. When asked to have it fixed the scrapped the pick out and put the rest in a smaller burrito. Wen walked back up to ask to have it fixed again the Manager Terry said to another worker loud enough for everybody to here, \"oh my god, she is coming back up here again.\" I asked for a full refund. She gave me four dollars and the meal was $7.99. Said because I didn't return it all (I ate the taco but offered to pay for it). I said a taco didn't cost $4. She said she would charge me for the drink too. I had two sips out of and returned the cup too. Then the general manager Emily was called up front. I explained that she gave me $4 back on a $8 meal. She rang it back up and saw the manager Terry was trying to refund a small burrito. Terry then told the GM, \"oh my mistake\" I received my money back but after the manager Terry completely embarrassed me in front of the whole store with her bad attitude."}
{"text":"Ordered the new Nacho Fries box and got a small bag barely full. Rudely talked to by the \"manager\" claiming this is the portion and it's not even in the container advertised in. Don't go to this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This the slowest fast food place ever. They are quick to take your money but 25mins later still waiting. The only reason we haven't left I'd because we already paid. Never again."}
{"text":"I rarely go to this location because if I am getting Taco Bell, it is after midnight and I am on my way home. Tonight was an exception, since I was staying in but felt like a crunchwrap. They got my order right, the service was friendly, and the food was good. Just need to bring back the green sauce in the packets."}
{"text":"I like taco bell it may not always be the cleanest, but it is still good food."}
{"text":"Meh.

I was having my friend over who I have not seen in awhile for a movie night. I asked her what she wanted to eat and she said Taco Bell so I drove there to get food before she came.

I picked the drive-thru and ordered a Mexican Pizza for my buddy and asked for no meat because she chooses to exclude it from her diet. They asked me 3x if I was sure that I did not want meat in the Mexican Pizza and all 3x I said, \"Yes, no meat in the Mexican Pizza\" 

I finished my order, paid, picked up the food, and went home.

The taco that I had ordered looked like a joke because it was only half filled? Where was the rest of the insides? Lol. My friend bit into her food and immediately spat it back out with a horrified look on her face saying there was meat in there. I apologized profusely and assured her that I did ask them not to put meat in there. Basically, there was no movie night because we had to go out to eat."}
{"text":"Ugh.  About every 3-4 years I somehow end up wanting to see if Taco Bell is still awful, and try it again.  Yup, still awful.  Tried a couple of the newer menu items, which of course taste exactly like all the other menu items.  I don't know why I keep thinking they may have changed."}
{"text":"What is there to say about a Taco bell.....? This one actually filled up the taco shell with more than just lettuce. I ordered 2 Hard Tacos and a Mexican Pizza. I was impressed by the amount of stuffing in the tacos. The pizza had a nice amount of tomatos also. Good job Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place is a combo KFC and Taco Bell.  I've eaten both.  The KFC is often a disaster.  The Taco Bell is...well, the same generic crap Taco Bell is known for, but not any worse than other locations.  If you feel like Taco Bell, then this is an OK place to get it in my experience.  Don't do the KFC here though, awful."}
{"text":"5/5/15 came here because the tv commercial was advertising a free biscuit burrito with any purchase.

1. Waiting 20 mins in the drive thru.

2. Got my order without free biscuit burrito, but because they took so long, I didn't have time to actually turn back.

3. My am crunch wrap was cold and the cheese wasn't melted like it used to.

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Solid place.  They always get my order correct.  Service is ok.  To be expected.  Don't quite understand what some of these other reviewers would expect from a Taco Bell drive thru attendant.  Take their place and serve food to jerks all day and see how you would act."}
{"text":"Waited to order in the store for 10 minutes. No one was at the register.  The drive through clerk and cook saw us. Made eye contact and they never greeted or said a word to us and just went on servicing the drive through customers. Will never go to that location ever again!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here with a lovely young lady at the drive through window and the cook, named Levon or Devon. They were so sweet about letting me change my order last week and patient. Love the people who work here !!"}
{"text":"Staff is always so nice! Obviously, the food is great because it's Taco Bell, but the staff are always so nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"This is of of the worst taco bells I've ever been to. The customer service is awful and they are notorious for messing up your order. And when they do screw it up they don't do anything to compensate you. And good luck trying to get through to them on the phone!! I will drive out of my way to avoid this one. Seriously though-how hard is it to get a simple order right and to be nice to your customer??"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Taco Bell (or any restaurant) I've ever been to. Been in line for just over half an hour with 6 cars in line. Eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Altough I am not a super fan of taco bell food, this restaurant has good service, the cashier smiled and was friendly, the people who put the food together were also happy.  The manage Luci was very kind and even asked how my meal was.  So for service and quickness they get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell never gets the order right, under-portions every item, conveniently forgets items, and over charges in comparison to neighboring Taco Bell's. This isn't a \"one-time\" issue, and other Yelp reviews have noted this as well."}
{"text":"Wish you could give less than 1 star. I've been waiting a half hour for 2 tacos and a drink. Don't come here. 4th time this has happened"}
{"text":"I'm happy that my go to Taco Bell for late night cravings is open again. The remodel looks good :)"}
{"text":"What can I say about Taco Bell?  I really don't like most of the menu items, but if you absolutely positively need fast food that isn't a sandwich, this is the place to go.  This location always seems busy.  They get you through quickly.  Servers have been pleasant and I've gotten my orders OK."}
{"text":"If I had to use one word to describe this location it would be inconsistent.  Sometimes the service is amazing and the food is well prepared.  (OK , it's still a Taco Bell, not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination).  Sometimes the servers are dumber than a box of rocks and the food is poorly prepared (beef burrito without beef for example).  All told, it can be an OK experience if you hit it right."}
{"text":"Your basic Taco Bell menu.  On my visit, service was friendly and timely.  Food was fresh and well prepared for fast food.  OK place to stop."}
{"text":"A new location, with your typical Taco Bell menu.  The biggest challenge is getting in and out - Steelyard drive is divided by the entrance, so you may have to take a long way in and out.  Overall, a good place."}
{"text":"Yes Taco Bell is not gourmet food, but the service at this location is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I hate this Taco Bell!! I waited 15-20 minutes in the drive-thru and after I paid the Manager comes to my car and claims that my card did not work and had to pay again.... so I looked on my mobile banking app and sure enough i had a debit from \"westaco\" for the exact amount! The Manager was irate and finally gave me my food.... I WILL NEVER EVER go to this taco bell... and after several emails have not heard one work from ANYONE! I was so disgusted at the level of service I received and was nervous that the Manager did something to my food because she was so irate with me that I threw it out! 

Please go across the street to Filibertos or just go to Del Taco!!! 

I HATE HATE HATE the service here... and now I just hate Taco Bell altogether!"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the drive through for almost 30min. I just wanted a quick snack before class. Lesson learned"}
{"text":"I am so tired of this Taco Bell! we would usually come here because it's less than a block from our house, but I've had it with them. any morning my boyfriend or I try to get breakfast, no matter what time, they are seemingly always out of waffle tacos. that would be fine IF they told us while we were ordering and not after we order and are already paying for our order at the window! and they can never make more because it \"takes hours to make them\"... really? you expect us to believe your fast food waffles take hours to make? my ass! this story and run out of supplies happens 8/10 times. now let's get to day time taco cravings. why is it so hard to get the order right even after you repeat it back? something we order is always replaced with something we didn't order or is just missing overall. for example, last nights order... how do you confuse carmel apple empanada with taco?! seriously?! granted two of their employees are super nice and get the order right when they work, but everyone else sucks there! if you're unsure of what we said in our order, just ask! I'd rather you get it right by asking instead of guessing and fucking it up. we will be driving to the Taco Bell on jones from now on!"}
{"text":"Just an update, this Taco Bell is still a good location to go to if you are into fast \"Mexican\" food.  They have always made my orders correctly.

I am typically here because of the Dbacks (AZ Diamondbacks) promo which is when they get five runs you can get three free tacos with the purchase of a large drink between 4p & 6p the next day.  $1.00 for supreme tacos; no limit to amount of promos purchased; drive thru & inside.

There is also a very friendly drive thru guy who speaks with a deep voice and gives your total in pennies.

Solid location."}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible. I'm not sure why I thanked the guy that rang us up. He acted like we were inconveniencing him by being there"}
{"text":"Slow as heck. Don't even know why I waste my time coming here. They also close the dining room early."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell EVER. One person at the window when I pulled in to the drive-through and still waited 10+ minuets. No apologies."}
{"text":"Does this look like no sour cream?
No. 
I also added chipotle sauce. +$.30 
Not here. 
This is the second time in two weeks I've had an issue with this location. 
Also.. Aaron C... no respect. If he can't invest in a belt, if I can see his rear end from my car.. I don't wanna go to this location. He's so rude over the mic. Doesn't help me when I have a question and gets attitude. 

I just tried to call this location 5 TIMES. 5 times. No answer. I also contacted corporate."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch yesterday. Drive through is a restricted lane, once you're in, you're stuck till you reach the end. No way to opt out if it's taking entirely too long. Worth mentioning because it takes entirely too long. Seems this is the place where they train slow drive through staffers to excel at being even slower than imaginable. The car in front of me was sympathizing with raised arms. (I was quiet, politely waiting in my car, not even making a scene). DONT come here if you're time limited in any way. Come here if you've got all the patience in the world and you must have standard Taco Bell fair. If thought it would have taken as much time as it did, I would have sought speedy lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is fucking trash. The customer service is garbage and the way they make food is horrible. This store is all around trash. Tear it down and make it a salsaritas."}
{"text":"A review for Taco Bell - \"this guy is nuts\" you might say.  

I'm not going to lie, Taco Bell is a guilty pleasure of mine.  The food is good and cheap.  But, the thing that sets this restaurant apart from any other fast food restaurant is it's service.   A matter of fact, this place has better service then probably 90% of sit-down restaurants out there.  The staff is always friendly and extremely hospitable.  This may sound crazy - but go check it out and you'll be blown away.  

I'm trying to convince my HR department (I work in hotels) that instead of recruiting out of any other avenue - we need to go find where this Taco Bell gets their associates.  Must have great management."}
{"text":"I get that fast go food service isn't five star dining on the las vegas strip BUT this was absolutely ridiculous we waited 20 minutes for our order what was INCORRECT!!!! Order number 91 , 92, and 93 got called before me and some one else next to me had number 89 and was very upset that they lost her receipt or some nonsense they tried to feed us. We'll non the less it was terrible staff was terrible and I will never return! They need to definitely get some help in this location. Owners should be more observant to his bad reviews."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. The woman who took my order was in a fantastic mood and seemed like she was having a great day, a very pleasant, simple thing that brightened my day up after having difficulties at work. Food was standard Taco Bell, delicious and streamlined to taste the same everywhere, but the customer service was impeccable and due to this I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is not so much a review as a call for answers.

WHY are they always out of food?

WHY is there always a 25-30 minute wait of cars before you can even order?

WHY do they always close early?

It's right by my house, and the wife likes Taco Bell as a quick cheap meal, but I guess they dont want my money."}
{"text":"We run thru the drive thru at this location as a matter of convenience.  The food it typical Taco Bell food and no complaints with that.  My complaint is the drive thru service.  The workers are friendly, the service is slow and I can live with that but the order accuracy is terrible.  8 times out of ten the order is wrong.  We check what we can check in the line but when we get home we may have the right number of tacos but not the right meat or something similar.  Tonight we had a similar experience.  The girl at the window checked it, we checked but when we got home it was wrong.There's a problem here with this store."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  40 minutes to get my food in drive threw!  Not the first time this happens, last time it was morning now it's at 7pm,  none in lobby"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Sometimes they're super friendly and get everything right in your order and then there's days where they mess up everything in your order. So make sure you check your bag before you drive away. 

Taco Bell is probably my favorite fast food joint. Just wish this place was better at checking there drive thru orders. Not convenient to drive back to get what's missing so I never do but I feel like I'm just giving away my money at this point. Not cool."}
{"text":"Never truly thought I'd rate Taco Bell ... or any fast food ever! But had a very positive experience tonight. Wish we would have gotten the guys name! Very fast & had the order correct WHILE being polite ! Finally someone that doesn't act like they are dying while working at the drive through window!"}
{"text":"Great place.....   Fun , quick , clean.......     Our cashier was Robelero e and she was super sweet"}
{"text":"This location is soooo slowwwww. I come to this one every once in a while and it's slow every single. Can you guys please find a solution to this problem???"}
{"text":"Breakfast is a huge disappointment. Although it has been offered off and on in other cities over the last 10 years, this latest offering, is the most over-priced CRAP to date.
What is being called a Breakfast Burrito is not even the size of an egg roll and being priced as if it were a Burrito Supreme."}
{"text":"Why do you idiots bother asking if we want sauce and then an even acknowledging it and then not put a damn packet in the bag? You wonder why you're being replaced with machines! Don't come to this damn location!"}
{"text":"How difficult is a Minimum Wage Job? 
Follow the instructions given during Training. Pretty simple.
Obviously Not!
Order & Pay For Taco Supremes, get regular Tacos. F'ing lovely. Idiots!"}
{"text":"I love the old style Taco Bell look of this place!! Reminds me of being a kid for this is how they looked!! I find the service too e fast and I have never had my order messed up here at all"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is pinching pennies too hard! $2.50 is already a high price for the nachos supreme but when it comes half full, I really feel like I'm getting ripped off! I'm also tired of having to beg for sauce! Extra sauce doesn't mean three packs! If I ask for extra or a handful of sauces, I am expecting at least 5 to 8 packs with my food! This Taco Bell needs to stop being so stingy!"}
{"text":"Just waited 20 minutes in line NOT EXAGERATING on a #7 for my husbans. Insane. Also watched many food items drop on the floor. Do not recomend"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! Some lady got stuck in the drive thru because her shift couldn't move from Peking. Called the store and the manager hanged up before saying idk why don't you get out and helped her. Waiting a good 10 mins in the drive-thru. I talked to the GM and her defending the managers actions. She shouldn't be a manager in the first place with hat attitude! If you can't handle a fast food job don't work there! I'm a manager at Mcdonalds no matter how customers get it's always customers first. If you guys have this problems move the car out of the damn drive thru. Think first! Something so easy and yet difficult for manager on the shift. Don't talk crap to the customers if you're not gonna face them. I asked multiple times for the name no name given! She was chubby and white with glasses. Treat your customers with respect. At least a discount or something. Don't be a rude employee. You don't like your job, quit. Simple!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this Taco Bell my Whole 28yrs of Life! Can't say I've ever had any issues. My one complaint is there were times I felt some of their employees in the drive-thru want to be stingy with the HOT SAUCE! Like Bruh.. I gotta have my hot sauce baby! LoL I want to say that was going on after the most recent remodeling but more recently the late night drive thru girls always ask me how many sauces I want! As for my food it always taste good! And service is friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"As most people know Taco Bell isn't the example of fine dining. For a quick bite of Mexican food, however, this does the trick. I'm a big fan of their soft taco supremes. I also like their nachos. This time around my wife and I also tried a fiery Doritos locos taco. It was also supposed to be supreme as well but they forgot the sour cream. Overall, if you want a quick fix Taco Bell is just ok"}
{"text":"Not open until 3am on Friday nights like their website says. I pulled up at 2:48 am. There was still a mustang in the parking lot but all of the lights were off. I can guarantee they didn't turn off just before I got there but regardless, I was still lied to."}
{"text":"I get off work late since I bartend and I'm usually hungry. This Taco Bell is close to my house and they always tell me they are out of everything about an hour before they close. They don't even ask what I want! Drive through is horrible I've pulled up and just heard employees laughing over the intercom. They clearly don't care about their job."}
{"text":"Yep sometimes Taco Bell is what you get when you want a good taco on the run."}
{"text":"This place has hands down, consistently been a positive taco bell experience.

I do not eat here after drinking, so I'm not all munchied up either.
This is a Sunday cheat meal. When I'm feeling worthless, and I believe that whatever you do , do it right.  So I sometimes come here and get about 3 TO 5 HARD TACOS, CHIPOTLE MAYO , fire, and that new hot sauce, slather that shit on, and chow down. Nom nom nom.   

I always get a cup of water, it is a really well made cup, I use it at work for a couple of weeks, for all my imbibing purposes.

The service is always fast and friendly. There is a lady who manages there , she is fantastic."}
{"text":"Four people working tonite including a female manager. 6 people in line, and at least 4 in drive-thru! Drive-thru guy was playing on his phone, and talking to co-workers while holding peoples ready orders. New guy Abraham got upset because we(customers) pointed out the fact that he was unsanitary since he was wiping off counters with his gloved hand, and messing with garbage and didn't change his gloves before going back to help manager prepare orders. Kathy the cashier eas very apologetic to everyone, because she saw we had been waiting 15-20 mins for our orders, and she kept trying to tell them we've been waiting. Instead of manager preparing drive-thru and inside orders in correct order, she focused on drive-thru orders, and she basically has up to 15 mins for each inside orders.
Health dept, and employee trainers definitely need to step in."}
{"text":"First time at this particular location, but you would think since it's a chain they would all be the same...boy was I wrong. I order nacho supreme and a Mexican pizza. The nachos barely had any meat or beans on them and the shell for the Mexican pizza tasted of old oil and stale. So awful!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the chicken on my cheese only quesadilla. Not a happy moment for this vegetarian."}
{"text":"Was asked to hold on a moment. Then asked for my order. Taco supreme. Then I was cut off \"We have no beef!\" So, no way to try a taco supreme here."}
{"text":"Is the lowest choice only one star? So be it. Picture this - drive thu on a slow Tuesday. I ordered a Cantina veggie burrito and four taco supremes. Pulled out and I took a couple bites of the burrito, made a u-turn and headed back to get a refund for a Cantina burrito that was nothing but black beans, a smear of guac and onions. Given the refund. Went all the way home with the four taco supremes. Opened them up and ...no sour cream, or tomatoes. My kids are ticked and I'm cooking! I called and the manager asked me to come back in for a refund. I feel like I've spent entirely too much time at this taco bell for one day. Once I'm refunded, I will never grace Taco Bell with my presence. Chipotle, here I come!

Update - received an apology and full refund."}
{"text":"So Sakara was awesome super friendly kid. Clearly new but the girl who was helping him Jaliyah was super pleasant. Food was Taco Bell but it was correct and fresh and fast and that's all I needed. Good group here and helpful! It's hard for chains to stand out but the staff here is solid!"}
{"text":"It's 11:20 as I right this I am getting my
Food the guy is just such a nice guy at the drive trough. I couldn't believe how nice and polite he was it was a new experience for me!! Don't even get that in resteraunts!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered my food and 15 minutes later I got it. I thought this is fast food. Then I get home to find out I missing half of my order. So I go back to pick up my food and I come home and found out that they totally messed up the other half that I had left here with my family. So then we had to go back for a second time to get it corrected. The employees were having a dance party and clearly did not care about helping any customers and never did they say sorry for the times that we had to go back or offer anything for the inconvenience of them messing up."}
{"text":"The attendant Daniel H. Was superb and very professional. He is definitely a company man!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell, what can I say? It's nice they are quick but more then once they've gotten my order wrong or don't given me any sauce. It's alright but don't expect some grand experience, but it's fast food and it's good enough."}
{"text":"They just don't care.  Sitting in the drive-through for 15min. All the employees are outside. Looks like they are smoking. I'm not buying anything from this place again."}
{"text":"Very clean dining area. Spotless bathroom. Friendly, professional and efficient employees!"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying. I don't really eat Taco Bell but I decided to try their new product. Quesalupa steak   And I was very disappointed!! It was horrible. First of all No cheese and very little steak. And this is the last time I will STEP FOOT AT TACO BELL.  FAKE Mexican food."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO INSIDE-DRIVE THRU ONLY
Corporate watches the drive through time. Inside is always a 15min+ wait. Tonight I waited 20min for one taco!!!! This is the third and final time each time was at least a 15 to 30 minute wait for food."}
{"text":"Ok, I know it was a fast food but they have excellent service and ok fast food.  My hubby love Taco Bell, so we come here once in awhile."}
{"text":"One of the better Taco Bells I've been to. Very clean and organized. Condiments, etc. we're well stocked. Friendly staff who answered our questions about the menu items and were very polite. Food came out quickly and looked and tasted freshly made.

Got the Power Bowl with chicken and really enjoyed it. Rice and chicken were slightly over cooked but other than that great choice. The Power menu is supposed to be the healthier option (under 500 cal) and it still tasted great. The bowl came with rice, chicken, guacamole, salad, sour cream + some kind of dressing and cheese. 

Overall good stop during a busy day."}
{"text":"We affectionately refer to Taco Bell as Taco Hell. Sometimes they get your order right and sometimes they don't. Just make sure you check it before you leave. This one has an outdoor patio which is nice when it is cool here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Sometimes their service is slow, sometimes it's pretty quick. Most of the time they get my order right, but they have gotten it wrong a time or two. 
It's your basic drive through fast food joint. I can't comment on the inside of the building as I always go through the drive through. It's really hit or miss each time you go in. My kids love Taco Bell, so we come here usually once a month for dinner."}
{"text":"This is how my burrito was wrapped. I get it it's fast food and you don't care but come on. I would like to post a pic but it won't let me."}
{"text":"I love this taco bell.  It's in a convenient location.  Open late. And it's one of the places I love to go after Some late evening grocery shopping"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of drunken late night trips to this particular location, but even in a sober mindset, I give this place 4 stars. The workers are friendly (as friendly as a 40+ something year old can be while working in a fast food joint) and one time the nice lady working the drive thru gave me a free fruitista freeze. The food is always good (in terms of Taco Bell standards) and they've never messed up my order EXCEPT on one occasion......

The gentleman working the drive thru failed to put a fork in the bag for my cheesy fiesta potatoes!!!!!!!! Of course I realized this after the fact, when 10 cars were still waiting for their food.... driving through again wasn't too appealing of an option.

Taco Bell almost got 5 stars out of me, but I had to give a 1/2 star deduction for the forkless cheesy fiesta potatoes incident and another 1/2 star deduction for the loud fat ratchets that swarm this place on Friday-Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru to grab a bite to eat for me and the family. The lady who took my order was very friendly, how ever, I had to pull around the the front waited about 10 mins for my food. When the lady came out she said did you want sauce because you didnt say so...I was like I was never asked but yes I would like some. She went back inside came back out with the bag and sauce. Then I got home, part of my order was missing and the part that I got was horrible. The burritos were smashed and the cheese for my Mexican pizza was glued to the top the the package.  I'd rather drive to the location on 59th ave and bell much better service and better quality of food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Taco Bell head hanchos are you listening?! Juanita is the best employee you got. Don't do her like cracker barrell did brads wife. She needs a raise and to be your head of something. Thanks."}
{"text":"We often visit this location because it is near our home and the people who work here are very customer orientated. We were served most recently by Kathy on Friday who went out of her way to make sure we were satisfied with our food and she made my husband got something he had mentioned he wished he had ordered-- free of charge: Rock Star frozen blast. I thought this was very nice of her and we didn't expect it. 
The food is always fresh here, prepared hot and served up quickly. The restaurant is clean and neat. The restrooms are clean and stocked. This location is one of the best in Phoenix. 
They don't appear to have a high turn-over with their employees either which signals that they care about them and have happy people working for them."}
{"text":"We love Taco Bell. This location is great and easy to get in and out. We love ordering through the app."}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast food places, but this is the best tasting Taco Bell we've ever been to. Not sure how/why it would be different/better, but it definitely is. And the order was perfect and everyone was completely competent at their job and friendly as well. Felt like we were in the Twilight Zone. LOL!"}
{"text":"The food that I got at this location last night was the worst food I have ever had at any Taco Bell in my entire lifetime. This is actually the second time I have been to this place and hoped that things have improved since my last visit since it was a very long time ago. After last night, I now know that I will never visit this abysmal excuse of a fast food restaurant ever again. On both of my visits, the contents of my food was \"lacking\". I ordered tacos and burritos and all items barely had any filling or contents. I mean BARELY anything!!!! There were literally less than 10 individual shreds of lettuce in my tacos. When I first opened the packaging I honestly thought there was no lettuce in my tacos. Then I just looked closer and noticed the very very few sprinklings of meat, lettuce and cheese. PLUS, they got my order wrong. I ordered a taco supreme and it was not supreme. Unfortunately, I bought my food in the drive-thru and didn't discover all this until I got home. I was furious!!! To boot, the place inside is filthy, empty and just downright terrible. Don't ever go to this restaurant. The franchisor is obviously instructing his staff to short change their customers by not preparing the food to the franchise's standards (i.e., actually putting food in the taco shells or tortillas). It just sucks because this is the closest Taco Bell to my house. Oh well, I truly hope they go out of business and fail miserably because this franchise owner doesn't deserve success."}
{"text":"The guy who took my order:
(Just looks at me, no acknowledgment or greeting. Doesn't even ask what I want. Just stares)
Me:....ok well can I get a blah blah blah

Anything else 

No. 

Anything else

No. 

FOR HERE OR TO GO

(Why are you raising your voice??)
Here...

$5.71

Hands me my change. Hands are dirty nails long and dirty. Yeah, please don't touch my food."}
{"text":"Stopped to get 2 soft tacos, beef only and a nachos supreme. The tacos were for my kid. Get home and they have beef AND cheese on them. She can't have cheese so the tacos got thrown in the garbage. I'm pissed. Never wasting my time there again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Taco bell since I was a kid. I recently read an article that Taco bell is the healthiest fast food restaurant. I was curious and decided to look up the latest menu. I was surprised to see so many vegetarian options. 

I came to the restaurant to order from the vegetarian selections. I ordered a black bean burrito. It wasn't on posted menu but I saw it online and it was in their register system. I also ordered a cheesy bean and rice burrito off their $1 and substituted the refried bean for black beans. Lastly, I ordered the 2-pack of the Cinnabon treats. 

I was very pleased with the taste. The burritos were filling but I don't feel like I was stuffed. I used the hot sauce and it had a little kick. The Cinnabon balls had what seemed to be icing in the center and cinnamon and sugar on the outside. They were hot and really good.

The cashier was patient with me because I took a while to order since I hadn't been there in so long. I was able to use Samsung Pay successfully. 

Overall, I was very pleased. I like to eat vegetarian when possible and it's really hard to find a lot of stuff when you have to stop for fast food. Taco Bell impressed me and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendliest service I have ever seen at a fast food place! I've very rarely ever had any mistakes in my order, and they fix them promptly with a smile."}
{"text":"My daughter ate there last night 4/19/2018 taco and chalupa  an hour later we are in hospital she got food poisoning from this Taco Bell I called the manager just to give him heads up he was very rude and stated not from there impossible I told him what time and hospital verified it as food poisoning he still blatantly denied it could be from his  restaurant. My daughter works at a hospital she Knew right away what happened. Be Aware people Stay Away from this location"}
{"text":"Date of Visit:  12.13.15, 8:15 a.m. //  Lauralyn was AMAZING!  At the drive-thru, I said I had not ordered breakfast in a very long time from Taco Bell so needed some time to look over the menu.  She affirmed that everything was delicious and that TB had the best breakfast items.  I told her I liked bacon and she made some suggestions.  When I told her I wanted coffee to drink, she stated that the coffee was fresh & hot and very tasty.  Her very positive attitude and positive affirmations about my food choices was outstanding service that, at 53 years old, have never received from a drive-thru nor at many of the upscale restaurants I frequent.  She is a real treasure!  If you are an employer and looking for a person who has a true heart/passion for customer service, try and 'steal' Lauralyn.  In my past professional life, I've worked with hundreds of hospitality (hotel) staff and she is definitely in the Top 10."}
{"text":"My experience was amazing at this Tbell. The place was clean, updated, and well designed. The staff was friendly and the food was even better! 5 stars! I usually go Sunday morning after going out the previous night, and my hungover self was very impressed. You will be seeing me in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and never again.  The first time I got 6 tacos and a few personal pizzas from the pizza hut side of things.  Got all the way home and realized that none of my tacos were in the bag.  You are taco bell, how do you forget the tacos?  I drove back and went inside to make sure I actually got them this time.  There was another patron inside waiting for something that they forgot to give him, and as we were waiting someone walked up to order their food and started the order by saying, \"Now last time I was here you guys forgot this so make sure you give it to me this time ok?\"  
We decided to give them one more chance and the consistency of failure continued.  This time we were smart enough to check the bags before we left and they forgot another item.  Never again.  If you want to pay for food that you won't get,  make sure to stop at this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Closing down for several months to add a kfc to a taco bell that is doing a perfectly fine business and then revising your hours so that you are not open as late doesn't impress me."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who reads Yelp reviews for Taco Bell but everyone here is correct. Avoid the drive-thru. It is slow and you are locked into the drive-thru so you can't leave once you make that fateful decision. This Taco Bell does close early so if you show up at 10:50 be prepared for some drama on the drive-thru speaker. Also on more than one occasion I've been told, \"We're all outta beef.\" So, basically your entire menu? Now, as for walk-in lunchtime, completely different story. They do serious volume and everything keeps moving and they've never screwed an order up. The register girl is super nice and there's usually someone walking around cleaning tables, the drink station and refilling the sauces. If you are 'that' person that stands there and looks at the menu for 7 minutes or highly customizes your order, please for the love of God use the Taco Bell app to put your order in and just click \"IN STORE\" when you park your car. Oh, and the drink station has Mountain Dew's Kickstart which is one of my favorite energy drinks."}
{"text":"Some Taco Bells load up the burrito! 
This one does not! 
If you are hungry go to the one in Painesville because this one will leave you starving! 
I have never seen such small portions!"}
{"text":"Discustinly dirty in the lobby, if the back is anything like the dining room good luck.  I'll stay clear in the future. The older gentleman at the front was super nice, but this dining room is nasty. Can't get past it."}
{"text":"Taco Bell restaurants have a very high variance in quality, which is unusual for a fast food chain. When you go to Wendy's you're fairly confident that the double-stack at a certain Wendy's is going to taste like the double-stack at a different Wendy's. This is certainly not the case with Taco Bell, which is why I think it's worth writing a review when you come across one that varies so far from the average.

I ordered a cheesy gordita crunch, steak quesarito, and a baja blast in the drive-through mid-afternoon on Thursday 10/4/14. 

The steak quesorito tasted severely burned. This was highly disappointing as the steak quesorito had quickly become my favorite menu item in its short existence. I was reluctant to finish it, but I was very hungry.

The baja blast also tasted poor. If I had to guess, their soda machine was broken. Admittedly, I haven't had baja blast in awhile, but I certainly remember enjoying it. No one could enjoy the soda I had that day.

The cheesy gordita crunch was solid, but unspectacular.

I hope this is not the regular level of quality this Taco Bell produces, but I felt compelled to share my extremely poor experience."}
{"text":"Literally the slowest drive thru I've ever experienced. Do NOT make the mistake of entering it."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is very popular in the vegan/vegetarian community.
 (Just ask for no meat or cheese or sour cream) (sub with gauc, rice or beans) Sometimes it's hard asking people that because they think you're crazy and sometimes aren't very friendly with me asking this simple task.

This Taco Bell was a very pleasant experience! Odilia B was so friendly and understanding! She even drew a little smiley face on my bag. 
Thank you for hiring such nice employees like her!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, this is fast food.  This Taco Bill/KFC location is one of the worst I've been to.  I go 4 - 5 times per year since it's close to work.  Usually find the place a little dirty and the service slow - at least it's consistent.  I think they stopped putting any type of sauce in their Bean Burritos and the chicken soft tacos are lacking enough filling - meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, etc to even come close to filling the shell.  

I've started going to the one near 19th/Deer Valley for a slightly better experience."}
{"text":"Ghetto. The KFC portion is limited. Don't expect many of the special menu items to be available at this location."}
{"text":"They've gotten my order wrong several times over the years but less often than some other places I've been to, service is good and friendly.  I really can't complain much about this location, a little slow on the drove thru wait times but again no worse than other places I've been."}
{"text":"This is, consistantly, one of the slowest fast-food restaurants I've ever been to.  Every time I go they take forever.  I love Taco Bell.  This restaurant happens to be a Taco Bell-KFC combo store.  I have to admit that the food seems to up to par most of the time.  However, this is a restaurant that is a part of the FAST-FOOD industry and no part of the process of eating here is FAST."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell consistently has good food, but don't forget to ask for sauces if you're in the drive thru."}
{"text":"This place literally forgets to give me taco bell sauce 6 out of 10 times that I go here. They'll ask me what sauce I want and still not put it in my bag. Come on, it's not that hard."}
{"text":"Always clean, always friendly, always super quick! We love coming here because we always get a really yummy filling meal for a small price. And they have free wifi!"}
{"text":"Looks like all Taco Bell's are not equal. 

This place is so slow, doesn't matter if you order in, drive thru, or even on the app! Heck it doesn't even matter what time of day you go. 

The orders are inconsistent and the food looks like it was just thrown together. Not sure if there's any kind of management but it feels like a bunch of randoms came together to make some tacos. 

I at least gave  them 2 stars because the location is easy to get to, up to date, and the drive thru person apologizes for the wait."}
{"text":"One of the worst Taco Bell's I've been to. Seems like this is a recurring theme with Pittsburgh.

We opted to go to this location since the other one was backed up.

10:30pm on a Saturday and the place literally looks closed. Some of their signs were burnt out and the drive thru screen was not working. 

I had to repeat the order 4 times and the employee had to put me on hold, I didn't even know that was possible in a drive thru. 

Even the outside and along the drive thru was so dark I thought there's no way this place is open. Waiting for Ashton Kutcher to pop out and tell me so was being punk'd.

I knew I had been overcharged but the drive thru guy insisted it adds up. Once I looked at the receipt, it was clear he accidentally charged me extra for a substitutions, something he didn't consider. 

Furthermore they were out of sauce; only options were the diablo and mild. 

The food was lukewarm and poorly made; first 5 and last 5 bites of my burrito was literally just the tortilla nothing else."}
{"text":"This location no matter what time of day is usually slow and slower at night. I don't know if the company is trying to save money and just have a few working. The food is good but we've always had to wait."}
{"text":"9:00 am on a Saturday morning and they dont have any EGGS.  COME ON where is the manager?"}
{"text":"defiantly one of the best locations that i have been to. we get lunch for a crew of about 10 every day we return to this location every time. they have only messed up our order one or two times. out of the 100's of times there.
we ordered about 20 items today and 5 different drinks and they got it all right 
we always go through the drive through they always either recognize the company car or the huge orders. they always remember us. its nothing outstanding food wise. i mean its tacobell its fastfood but as far as tacobell goes they are a 9/10. as long as they continue to kick but we will come back"}
{"text":"This place is str8 bawlin y'all. Have you even mouthed a crunch wrap pressed down by the beautiful gentle hands of Madeline. I've had my share of late night nosh snacks but this flower of a human being comes into my life and touches deep into my loins. Madeline if you are reading this I want to be with you in more than just a drive thru (through?) type of way. This could work on more than just a 9-5 (or graveyard shift) level. Please call me back and let's toast some cinny twists. I'm sorry to open forum my love (lust) for you. Be mine."}
{"text":"I come here maybe 2 or 3 times a month and let me start by saying this place is amazing! Inside it's very clean and the staff is amiable! Not once have they ever messed up my order. The prices are reasonable and the food tastes delicious! I strongly suggest anyone come here if they want non-expensive, good quality food and service!"}
{"text":"I thought if I go inside and order in person it would prevent mistakes. I was wrong they ordered 3 extra things that I never said I wanted that were expensive. I didn't think The total sounded right but wasn't sure until I got home. Unreal!"}
{"text":"No friendliness.  No hello or thank you.   No have a nice day.   This taco bell is still the worst"}
{"text":"Food is inexpensive, service is bad, but then it's Taco Bell. Cashiers talking and ignoring the customer should be expected."}
{"text":"I usually don't review fast food joints unless the service was amazing. 

Lanieshia gave us great customer service. She was a one (wo)man team. She took care of the lines inside the building and took care of the drive-thru orders. I was wow'd by her. 

Really great. Thank you !"}
{"text":"Taco Bell has two ingredients ...   Grease salt.  Everything taste as the same and if I don't throw up...   I ind up spitting dust for days from all  the salt!

I understand why kids like it because they generally like credo and have to learn yo discern crap from non-crap. 

Another chain full of food not fit fior human consumption.    

BLECH!"}
{"text":"So I had to actually post a five star at TB. First time in a LONG time that a whole order for six people was correct all the way down to no sour cream. This is how it should be. Thank you. 8-3-17 at 5:00pm"}
{"text":"I work across the street and while I don't come here super often, anytime I do the service is AMAZING. I have very little expectations for fast food, yet they always blow me away with very cheery, friendly personality. And even when picking up multiple orders for several people at night, never act annoyed by this or mess up orders!"}
{"text":"For a very long time I absolutely hated Taco Bell. I felt the one here in Lakewood on 117th was wayyyy too ghetto and dirty, care free that they shouldn't even have been in business. I doubted that Management or upper at least was involved in bettering their stores. Today beginning of February 2017 I've gotta say I've seen the best service I've ever seen here. Outstanding, the crew looks happy, they're working fast, a customer even just told the cashier this is the best Taco Bell. I've never heard anyone say anything close to that in here. She's even holding this convo with this guy as she's out here working on her dining room. I'm a general manager at a pizza shop and I have to say that's amazing. Definitely changed my opinion. I wrote reviews to let people know when they're going a good job because I love to see it, makes the world better. I just hope they continue this atmosphere in a store that once use to be terrible. Why I always give places second chances."}
{"text":"Literally the nicest, most sincere, excited employees I have seen working at a fast-food establishment. Never had a problem with the food or drinks. The rest of it is an average Taco Bell, but every single time I go, even through the drive-thru for a quick drink, the employees are the nicest people ever."}
{"text":"Ok so I know this is Taco Bell. I'm not in a 5 star restaurant. I'm here right now. There's a guy running the register who's attitude smells like my asshole. There are no clean tables. I'm literally watching a mother(customer) wipe her own table down so her and her kid can sit. Not really happy about this. That diablo sauce fire tho."}
{"text":"Horrible service.they have no idea what they are doing.had to wait 20 mins until I got my food for pick up .!!and I was the only one in the store.the ladies here were rude AF when I asked for something.!lol"}
{"text":"SLOWWW. Tues night 2 cars ahead of me, 15 mins to get to the window. I told them to keep the food and went to Wendy's. That taco bell is garbage."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell in Henderson /Vegas
Prepared my order incorrectly then did not replace or even try to make it right ...When asked to speak with the Manager and/or District Manager was told \"they won't call you back\"  That was true ...they didn't
Eat there at your own risk...there are many other great options around this area...think about choosing one of those before going there"}
{"text":"Ordered online for the first time - WHAT A GREAT SITE.  Awesome.  You can see everything on the menu - add or take items off - it's all there.  

The BEST PART~~~  the Chardon Taco Bell was ready when I picked it up and EVERYTHING - I mean EVERYTHING was exactly right.  

BEST SITE I'VE EVER ORDERED FROM....  You got it going on Taco Bell!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is usually very sloppy in this location and they often mess up orders.

Figured I could be more descriptive.. My family loveees tacos. With a passion. But every time we seem to visit this location we're lucky to get our orders correct. Plain is plain! -_- it's cool to stop by when the Diamondbacks win, but eh, we've moved on :("}
{"text":"Taco bell is always great but this location is only open until 11 pm on weekdays not 1 am like their posted hours would suggest."}
{"text":"Came here because my pregnant wife was craving tacos. After waiting 15 minutes in a drive thru line that was not moving, we decided to go inside. We walked in there a guest waiting, so we waited. No cashier in site. There were 2 cashiers at the drive thru and kept apologizing for the wait. So after a few minutes we said excuse me, does anybody work here!? And she goes oh yes hold on. She calls some girl from the back and continues to tell her she has guest in line. Just as she was coming up, the guy who was making tacos, had gloves on and came around the corner and touched the dirty ass bar with the same gloves he's using to make tacos. That's when we said absolutely not, and left. The cashier continues to say, \"you don't want anything?\" Absolutely not I said and took my business elsewhere. Not only did you have me waiting for over 20 minutes for some damn tacos but you wanna be dirty too?! No thank you. EAT WITH CAUTION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Girl at drive through was extremely pleasant tonight! Lol no prob with my food. N I got a happy face on my order."}
{"text":"Horrible expierence on a late night run after work. I ordered a few items, but the bean burrito is what caught my attention!! It was so small i thought it look some what like a \"roll up\".. I had called them up and the manager spoke to me saying \"nothing was wrong with it\" she in fact made it, and it was up to bean standards! lol, so I went down there to show her how silly the bean burrito she made looked. She displayed the scoop stadards by making me a new one and I tossed it in the trash! Her attitude pissed me off she was rude not letting me explain why I was upset. I am the customer, and don't forget it's the customer that makes your check! I have yet to return I rather go waste my money else where!"}
{"text":"I had ordered some tacos after work and I was baffled on how much meat they put in them! It's ridiculous ...."}
{"text":"It's taco bell.  Not much to write about this place.  Cheep food, sloppily made, but totally what I expected.  This location seems clean to the eye and so far I haven't got sick eating here so I recommend this location if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I sat in line in the drive-through for approximately 30 minutes, just to order and it took another 15 mins to get my order, who ever was working 9/23/17 around 8 pm should be fired it was a complete joke. 45 mins for fast food from the drive thru... Night 2, October 6, 2017 currently waited in line for about 40 minutes haven't even been able to order yet, I actually think I'm gonna start driving down the road to go to the different Taco Bell because this one is so shitty, I am apalled by how slow this dang drive-through is."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. But for taco bell this location has great service, food was fast & delicious. Only thing I didn't like was how small the inside dining section was but if the weather was nice the patio would be worth sitting at."}
{"text":"Taco Bell - for a fast food restaurants it's quick and easy. I've dropped into this location several times to beat down some tacos and burritos, among other things of course. My favorite is the enchurito but Word on the street is this item has been discontinued. But with plenty on items on the menu, I guess I can satisfy my taste buds somehow. You can always buy a burrito and a taco supreme then put them together and make your own jumbo size burrito supreme. Yeah, that's a J Monday special.....haha! 
Location wise - it's very convenient. Pretty quick drive through. Can't say that my order has been messed up yet which is a plus for this food chain. Inside is a bit aged, doesn't have that awesome clean feel to it but it's not dirty either. Overall, when I'm in need for pretend Mexican food that's fast and fast, and I just happen to be in the area this will be my jam."}
{"text":"Food is acceptable. Prostitution going on during the day deters me from frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"Would give less than a star but sometimes its so, so.  Today i tried the triple crunch wrap.  Would have been nice if i had been told it had sour cream on it.  I had to throw it away.  About 3 bites in and i got a mouth full of sour cream and nearly puked.  The commercials dont even mention sour cream.
They need to make sure patrons are informed.  Im so sick now i cant eat anything.
Thanks for making me waste money.
Start doing better."}
{"text":"Well it's Taco Bell so I wasn't really expecting much. I actually went inside since I had some time to kill and it was surprisingly clean on the inside. The employees were all extremely friendly. They must be doing an overhaul on their customer service because the last few times I've been to Taco Bell they have been extremely friendly. Food wasn't anything impressive but it's fast food that I paid $5 for sooo you get what you pay for there. Anyway I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the the employees."}
{"text":"Out of all the fast food joints I feel less awful about eating here vs anywhere else. call me crazy, I know.... 

So this location is new & clean. Service was good & quick. Textbook Taco Bell operating procedures. I've been hearing the adds, seeing the adds & I finally found a Taco Bell in route to my daily adventures so I decided to see if these breakfast menu items were something to brag about. I had the sausage waffle taco & my buddy had the bacon waffle taco. We both ate it due to being hungry but we were both like ehhhhhh I've had better.... The hash brown was good size in comparison to McDonald's but it was saturated in grease. It was an adventure accomplished but shortly lived. I can't see myself craving one more of these little taco breakfasts anytime soon. Guess the pancakewich is still reining supreme."}
{"text":"Currently in the drive thru. Have been here over 10 minutes and have moved only 2 car lengths. This is not fast food."}
{"text":"The Stuft Nacho box was pretty good.  The service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"First time my fiancé and I came it wasn't horrible so we thought we would give them another chance. Well we thought wrong. Waited in the front for a good while before two employees came out of the bathroom at the same time. Then I witnessed a drug deal happen right in front of me with a Hispanic woman and white man who was a cook. Like really?? Then we go to get iced tea and they don't have it out so we ask and they say- \"sorry we just ran out.\" OKAY THEN MAKE MORE ???? What a joke. Then out fish tasted like the oil was burnt or hasn't been changed out in a few days. I'm disgusted and won't be back ever again."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! They are very friendly and help you pick the best foods from the menu haha They keep the lobby very clean. My order was complicated but she was very patient and they got my order correct! Planning to come again very soon!!"}
{"text":"Everyone on this shift was un friendly. Made the order wrong twice. Up on a request to re do the order, supervisor gave bad attitude and order was still not right. I had left my food. Not going back to this location again. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Have waited in the drive through for over 15 minutes multiple times.  Would recommend going to one of the many other taco bells that are close"}
{"text":"Ok first off if I can give it lower stars I would Jason S the manager of the nighttime crew has screwed up my order two times in the last week he has physically handed me my order and taking my order I recommend not going here I've already complained once I advise the community not to go here they will definitely screw up your order especially Jason S I mean come on bro it's Taco Bell I've worked in the food industry for 12 years professional real serving you guys want $15 an hour and can't even read the screen let alone keep the lettuce off my tacos I really hope some upper management gets to me about this because if not I will be going to three on your side and the Better Business Bureau"}
{"text":"SLOW!!!!!! I've been in the drive thru for 28 minutes!!! Trapped!!! By cars so I can't even exit if I want to!!! Never again at this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here the lady is always rude. She be at the drive thru. Lady if you don't love your job I will be glad to take your job and sell them tacos. Heck I would be out there doing a taco Tuesday dance..customer service is bland...step up your game taco bell what happened  to that sense of humor with customers Crack a joke to make them smile. Just because some customers are rude doesn't mean you have to get payback and be rude back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Terribly service. Store stinks and had to wait forever. I was waiting for 7 minutes before anyone even came upfront. Then keep waiting for food. I have even gone through their drive through multiple times and it takes forever!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever.  I'm writing this as I wait in the drive through, I've been here for at least 10min already."}
{"text":"The only reason I go to this one is because it's the closest to my house. 


Every time I go through the drive through there and get food the complete order is never there!! It's annoying. If it happened once or twice, no big deal, because everyone makes mistakes, but come on! I just want to get off work, pick up the kid and go through the drive through and grab food without having to go back up there because heaven forbid anyone up there actually answer the damn phone! 

When you order 2 tacos, 2 burritos, and 2 quesadillas with some chips and cheese you would think it would be fairly straight forward.........

Nope, I get home and the burritos are missing and that is what the kid wanted ? and she can't have chips and cheese for dinner. By the way , the cheese in the container - can you guys at least fill it up and not more towards the empty side ?

Sincerely, 
The frustrated mom that now has to get in the car and drive back up there after digging through the trash for my receipt because your employees fail to do their job correctly time and time again"}
{"text":"My Taco Bell fix before or  after Golf @ Tuscany. Nice  location only negative is it is a little hard to get into, not real hard but wish it was easier."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't love Taco Bell but I do. This is my go to TB. I would give it 5 stars as I have never had a problem here and I go there alot!!! but can't give a taco bell 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good taco bell, an I love my taco bell. I almost always have me a couple of chicken burritos. was clean and fast and food seemed fresh. Good amount of chicken in my burritos as apposed to some locations that fill with rice and add a little chicken."}
{"text":"My experience was very different from the other reviews. After giving the cashier my order, I sat by a window. I calmly watched person after person park their cars, walk into the store and give their orders and receive them right away. I simply ordered nachos. After several minutes of this, I decided to ask for a refund. The manager apologized and said he will have someone make it right now. I asked\" was anyone trying to fill my order before I came up?\" Apparently not!!! So I wasted my entire lunch hour waiting for a dish that was never going to come. I refused the offer to \"make it now\" as I didn't have any time left. I had to leave hungry and pissed."}
{"text":"Worst service! !! 30 minutes for a fast food order ! Without any apologies....never coming back"}
{"text":"Extremely kind service from every employee I've encountered whether inside or using the drive-thru. They recently remodeled the dinning room, giving it a beautiful and much-needed update."}
{"text":"I frequently stop at this Taco Bell, and for the most part get decent food, hot and fresh.
Tonight around 10:30 pm after picking my son up from work we decided to go through the drive thru.  We live not too far and so there was no reason for the food to be cold. 
Honestly I have never been more disappointed and disgusted by the food we ordered. 
The bean burrito was ordered to have NO onions, there was a few onions and pieces of lettuce, the beans were scarce and dry and cold.  You would think that they prepared other food over this burrito.  My chalupa had very little beef and tons of lettuce...  Again COLD. 
We also ordered the cinnamon delights, which I'm just waiting for it to kick in and upset my stomach for the amount of grease that dripped out... These were also cold and over cooked, which explains the dripping grease.  It's making me nauseous. 

Don't eat there after 10:00 pm because it's apparent you will get the bottom of the barrel, as I'm sure they wouldn't want to have to prepare fresh food at the end of the night..  

If I had been able to go back, I'd ask for a refund of the $16 something we spent on  horrible food."}
{"text":"A friend & I went through the drive-thru & ordered the Baja Mountain Dew freeze. Usually they will fill it up all the way, but this employee didn't and when my friend asked about it he got all defensive $ basically said, \"Idk what Taco Bell you went to, but they're wrong we don't fill it up like that\". & well you see here sir, we've been going to this one & they always filled it up to atleast fill the slurpee lid. Why would you give us slurpee lids if you're not going to fill it up? That's why they're shaped that way for a reason or else he should've just given us a flat lid. Geez. & then he opened our straws & put it in our drinks & mine had a hole in it. I don't know where your hands have been. Oh Taco Bell. I'm just gonna go to the one on Warm Springs."}
{"text":"They are so slow they make you wait forever for you good and once you finally get home there is only like 2 sauce packets in my bag for 4 tacos smh. It's sad because this one is the closest by me but yet they can never offer great good with fast service."}
{"text":"I think its the Drive Thru thats the problem.  I go inside, everything is great.  I get my food home from the Drive Thru, no sauce, missing food, burned or 1/2 empty nacho cheese cups and crumb piles for chips.  Wish there were a 2.5 star rating I could give it"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Ate at the long johns part. But forgot a piece of my fish. They did replace it, but not really the point. Room for improvement. Was clean at least. But had to ask for ketchup to be refilled and the little cups to be refilled. Sighs."}
{"text":"Bought one of those big boxes for a chance to win the gold play station. I entered my code and it said it was already used! Wtf? Stop trying to recycle codes! What a rip off!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! They are always behind! It's called fast food for a reason, what is the issue? 15-20 min wait in the drive threw for a darn chicken quesadilla!! Fire all your employees and get people in there who know how to hustle! You guys suck!!"}
{"text":"What Moron decided that you only need a thimble of cheese with your chips?? And if you order any specialty item it will be a waist of your money! Service is slower than molasses in January uphill! Big thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. This is the first location of Taco Bell that hasn't messed up my order yet! It is near ASU so it get busy late at night, but what do u expect."}
{"text":"Shame that I have to give even 1 star.  You come to this place and you can't pull out of the drive thru because of the barrier.  Problem is they take literally a half hour to get you through the line.  They are extremely slow.  They say they're busy, but you watch through the window them playing on their phones, laughing, horsing around, eating food and drinking right while making food.  They're rude and incompetent.  Then you get the food, and it's just cold.  They are not able to multi task, can barely do one task.  Corporate should come in and take over... absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain about fast food restaurants because heck it's fast food.. But when I go to get my food at night and there's lazy staff that's RUDE. Nearly snatched the money out of my hand after I asked for sour cream after I had already paid and then I get home and NO SOUR CREAM. Don't work in the food industry if you have bad customer service..."}
{"text":"This place is actually nice... I love ordering the number 6... and the person who took our order was really nice... I think his name was Miguel R. His really nice and made our experince here really good.. we where even got a deal just doing a survey and we got a cinnamon twirl for dessert!! What else can u ask for... free dessert and it was actually really good.. must try!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Taco Bells I've been too. The foods tastes fresh and hits the spot when craving low priced Taco's and Burritos. The staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Horrible place & service. Yes I get it is a fast food place, but this one NEVER gets my order right. They stopped putting receipts in the bag so you can't call them out on their mistakes. There is always something missing from the drive thru order. My meal came without meat too? And the service is always painfully slow. Drive the extra few miles into Madison for Taco Bell. Forget the sun prairie one."}
{"text":"The person working the register never spoke or made eye contact. She just walked up and stood there staring into the distance. I had to repeat my order 3 times before she got it right. It was not busy. My order came out correct. The person mumbling the order number began walking into the lobby. Only then was I able to hear him. The tea canisters were poorly labelled. I felt I had to solve the clues to determine sweet or unsweetened. 
There is obviously a lack of leadership at this location. Customer service is seriously lacking in the Taco Bell brand. I typically have this experience at most Taco Bells. It's really unfortunate."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is well, Taco Bell.  New store with friendly staff.  Need something fast, crunchy and cheap?    Taco Bell is the place.  This is a nice one."}
{"text":"the woman who took my order/form of payment was very noticable under the unfluence of something. she took my card for payment, and did not come back to the window for about 10 minutes, at which point she told me my total would be $4 and some change but my order was actually $10 and some change, she had forgotten to give me my card back and completely forgot i had been sitting at the windows for the past ten minutes. she seemed extremely distracted and was using the moniter of the computer to hold herself still because she couldn't seem to stand up straight on her own. My order was correct on the drive thru screen and it is correct on my receipt, but i did not receive the correct pizza. The entire drive thru experience took 20-25 minutes. I have been to this location one other time in the past and did not have any issues whatsoever, so i was extremely disappointed with my experience this last time."}
{"text":"Ouch, said it was open until 12. Pretty heart breaking when you leave your house and travel to the only fast food within 2 miles only to find out it was closed at 11:20. I was starving"}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fast. I tend to go in the late hours after 10 pm. I've never had bad food there. Its taco bell but I will say the people are polite and they move the drive through pretty fast."}
{"text":"If you're a taco bell lover, they won't disappoint. I mean-this is not 4 nor even 3 star FOOD comparatively, but it's good taco bell. :)

Try the Dorito Taco-it's incredible!"}
{"text":"Speedy and accurate drive thru. Tight space but you can still get your taco on!"}
{"text":"Hey, it's just a Taco Bell. But, it's the best Taco Bell around. The staff is friendly and consistent.  I'm not proud to admit the frequency in which I enjoy Taco Bell, but it is what it is. 

This has been my Bell for 18 months and I also use the one by work in tempe. Occasionally, I'll get the TB withdrawals when abroad and visit the random location for a quick fix.  This location is reliable for temperature, freshness and consistency.  Orders are always correct and delicious. 

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Closed at 4, not 5. Some one needs to update this because I just drove several miles for nothing."}
{"text":"Don't say open 24/7 when close for a few hours every AM... and when some asks for well done, it doesn't mean let's see how little u can cook it...."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is what it is, rating the food is senseless. You like it or you don't. Since I'm a vegetarian, I appreciate their 7-layer burrito with 7 layers of everything but meat. And their crispy potato taco. For 89 cents, it's a basic taco with some seasoned fried potatoes, some sauce, cheese and lettuce. It's not gourmet, but I love it.

Anyways, forget about the food. The employees in this place must be making a hefty salary because ALL of them are ridiculously sweet. They are quick, but always eager to find out how you're doing. \"don't feel like cooking today?\" she asked me tonight \"wow, I love your tattoo, how long did that take?\" he asked me last time. \"have a good night sweetie\" I hear as I take off. 

Good ol fashion personality. Love it."}
{"text":"I know it's t bell!!! But sometimes you can get really shifty service tonight I went to get food and wow was the service great! Hunter w and the other crew were so awesome:)! Really cool! Did a wonderful job and made ordering food there worth it!! 
Sounds funny but they know how to do there job:)! Made my night better:)! Thanks"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite Mexican places! I know it's a fast food joint, and I have been to other Mexican restaurants which are just as good but I am so surprised how a fast food joint has made it so easily for vegetarians to eat there as well with all there meat options available. A lot of fast food joints will not substitute items as they are on a rush but Taco Bell is amazing! I'm not sure if this is the same for all Taco Bell location but this location in particular is so adaptive to the needs of vegetarians. They have made their supreme fries available with beans which is SOOOO GOOD and their crunch wrap which is also veggie now. They have the cheese quesadillas and you can ask for as many hot sauce packets as you need. The 7-layered burrito is my FAVVVE!! Love it here!"}
{"text":"This is what was inside my chicken quesarito. Barely any rice and a couple chunks of chicken. And it's $4."}
{"text":"Should be 0 stars, mold on flatbread, I told worker and watched him tell food prep person, instead of pulling the bag of flatbread, she gave me a dirty look, made me another one, which I refused. All I wanted them to do was pull that bag of flatbread. I reported it to corporate, and they never followed up with me like they said they would. This staff here is dangerous , health risk if you eat here."}
{"text":"These guys are hands down the NICEST drive-thru people I've ever encountered... and I'm a late night junkie for drive thrus!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the cleanest Taco Bell I have ever been in in my life. I Was treated with courtesy and the food came out very promptly. For a fast food place this one is very good."}
{"text":"I had over cooked rice in my burrito and I received a messed up order as well I didn't want sour cream on my other burritos . But other than that I have no complaints ."}
{"text":"This place really does suck!

It's kind of pointless having 2 sides to cook food on and you're only operating off of one with only one person working the line. Then on top of that because you're running one line with one person everything piles up and it takes forever to get your food when it should only take a few minutes at the most. Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again. I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road. 

To top it off the sanitary in this place is horrible!! Constantly food all over the floor and your feet stick to it. Yet it never really looks like anyone cares to clean. Because of that I'm scared to even go into the bathrooms. 

If there was another Taco Bell around Id never go to this one again."}
{"text":"The employees are nice here, but this is the pokiest Taco Bell I've ever been to. I come to this particular location at least once a week and always order inside. Every single time I have had to wait an excessive amount of time for a pretty small, simplistic order. Seems like maybe they're understaffed and they ignore the interior to focus on the drive through? Either way, it's rather ridiculous."}
{"text":"Loco Dorito Supreme taco's render me powerless! They are my delicious, edible, finger licking good kryptonite. Oddly enough, I don't normally even eat Doritos, lol! 
I haven't gotten anything else on the menu, so my food commentary stops there. 

I use the drive through, which is always fast. No matter how long the line is they are quick & the staff have always been friendly. 

I wish they had Coke products instead of Pepsi, but I should probably be drinking more water anyway, so no real complaints here :)"}
{"text":"Food was fine. But smelled like a bad 711. Smelled like dirty ass. And they allowed pets in the place. Was not a service dog. Service digs don't sniff people's legs."}
{"text":"Again, three stars for food only. I honestly don't know why I keep going here. The wait time is awful. Why does it take 15 minutes to make a taco, especially if I ordered it online ahead of time? Either you're short-staffed or your workers just don't care. When I went in today, there were three people on cash registers. Three! Why not have more people making food if there's obviously a rush of orders? On top of it, one of the boys running the cash register was pacing back and forth like he didn't know what the hell he was supposed to be doing, and I saw him picking his nose and then rolling around whatever he managed to dig out in his fingers. That's disgusting."}
{"text":"A clean Taco Bell location

PROS: 
one of the cleanest TB locations that I've been in
Friendly Staff

CONS:
Okay, this will sound silly... but it's annoying the way you have to enter and exit the location.  You can't go Rt. 48 South when leaving  *smh* and you can't enter when traveling Rt. 48 North without turning into the Oak Park Mall shopping center and then you have to circle the lot so that you don't violate any traffic laws to turn into the designated turn-in.  It's pretty bizarre!"}
{"text":"In terms of Taco Bell's go this is the best one to go to when in south Phoenix. I've been here multiple times and they've never had my order wrong. I'd say in comparison to other Taco Bells this one has above average service with generally friendly and welcoming staff. As well the store is kept clean and presentable. Food is prepared correctly and is on par with other Taco Bells.

I wouldn't write a review about a fast food chain unless I feel they genuinely deserved it.

Note: This review is in comparison to other Taco Bells. In the end you still get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this 3 stars because on my last visit the service was good, I got my food in a timely manner, however I just didn't like the taste of it.

I grew up eating taco bell multiple times per week, so I know what good taco bell is suppose to taste like and this just didn't do it for me, except for the caramel  empanada that I ordered. That tasted like golden perfection.

So if you go to this location please do yourself a favor and get the caramel empanada other than that I can't recommend anything else except for the Baja blast drink."}
{"text":"Quick service, but the order was inaccurate, the filling in my cheesy gordita crunch was inadequate, and the food was cold. Usually I have better service here, but today was not the best."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell you get what you pay for. However I have to leave a review because every time I come here there's the same girl working the drive thru. She's just so nice and does a great job at getting all the orders done. Honestly, sometimes it seems like she's on her own! Idk if she enjoys her job but her personality just shines through! She's just so genuinely kind! I tried to see what her name was but didn't catch it."}
{"text":"Food was ok for fast food, but the bathroom was disgusting! I had to use a paper towel to turn on the faucets and open the door so I wouldn't catch anything. Glad I have a strong stomach!"}
{"text":"Ok place to grab a quick bite to eat when I'm in the area.  They're always fast and accurate.  Lunch hour is the worst because huge lines at the drive thru and inside make it a nightmare.  I won't come during those hours.

Will I return?  Sure."}
{"text":"When I'm on the go and need some quick food, I eat at fast food restaurants.  I recently found this one in Mesa.  It's clean, but not as fast and efficient as most Taco Bells.

I ordered my usual order (7 Layer Burrito, 2 Bean Burritos).  I sat and waited a while to get my order...and it wasn't during the lunch rush.  The food came out and here's where it fell apart, literally.  Whomever was making the food didn't know how to properly roll a Burrito.  Each of the Burritos fell apart as I ate it because it was not rolled \"tight\" and the contents spilled out the bottom and sides.  That's Burrito 101....

Oh well, I may have caught them on a bad day or some new kid might've been training.  It tasted like a normal Taco Bell meal, so at least they got that right.

{"text":"I've been going to this location for 10 years. It's service and freshness are better than any other I've been to, and they keep the place super clean. Even the bathroom is clean! They don't jip you on burrito fillings or sauce/toppings, their tomatoes taste like tomatoes instead of hand sanitizer, and I think I've only had a stale taco twice since they opened. That's impressive on its own!"}
{"text":"Even though I live relatively close to this Taco Bell, I rarely come here.  Had a couple of meals here recently and got my fav's...

7 Layer Burrito, $2.29
2 Bean Burritos, $1.98

The restaurant is kept clean and unless it's the lunch rush, it's always fast.  Nice cheap option when you're hungry and on the run.

{"text":"Time for an update.  This Taco Bell is located right off the 101 and is very convenient when I'm on the go.  Since my last review, they discontinued the Cheesy Beans & Rice Burrito (Boo!), so I've replaced it with just a regular Bean Burrito on my normal order.

The customer service here is good most of the time.  When you employ teenagers, you don't know what you're going to get, so it's always inconsistent...but they do a good job for the most part.  They've always got my order right and served it up fast.  What more could I ask for?

It's an OK spot for quick eats.  The only bad part is the parking...there's only a few spots and when it gets busy at lunch, you have nowhere to park.

{"text":"What happened to Taco Bell?  It use to be one of my favorite Guilty Pleasures....it has fallen so far down my list, I don't even crave it anymore.  Why?

- Because their portions are much smaller.

- Prices increased.

- Quality of the food downhill.

My most recent visit the other day I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito ($1.99) and 2 Bean Burritos ($1.09).  The Bean Burritos were the size of the ones they sold a few years ago for 69 cents....now they're $1.09?  They're freakin' tiny and unsatisfying.  The 7 Layer Burrito has taken a huge hit in quality too.....all of the ingredients tasted bland.....blech.  Also, Taco Bell has the habit of not putting out their Fire Sauce for people to use....only Hot & Mild.....and when you ask for some, they give you 2 packets for each item.  I can easily use up 4 or 5 per item....whatever.

Overall Value - Even though I spent less than $5, it was garbage.  Only reason why I stopped by was because of old memories of good junk food.

Will I return?  Eventually, someday.....but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Taco Bell.....my favorite place to grab a quick bite when I'm short on cash in the wallet.  My Son enjoys a bunch of menu items here, but I'm a simple guy.  90% of the time I get 2 Bean Burritos, sometimes I order a 7 Layer Burrito.  

This location always has fresh ingredients and always has quick, accurate service.  It's nestled between Sun City Summerlin (which is a retirement community) and the original Summerlin, which is a little over 20 yrs old.....so there's rarely a long line or wait here.

Will I return?  I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"I'm in the area frequently, so I eat lunch here often when I'm in need of a quick bite to eat.  Nine times out of ten, it's a good experience as long as I get here before 12 pm.  Once 12 pm hits, it's impossible to find a table/seat since it's the start of the lunch rush.

My fav items to get are 7 Layer Burritos and Bean Burritos.  This location makes larger than average portions too, so you get your money's worth.

The employees here are usually friendly and helpful.  That's one of the reasons I come back so often.

Place was clean.

Food was ok.

It's Taco Bell....not much to say.

Will I return?  Sure."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is located very close to Paradise Valley, which is evident because the Fry's supermarket that shares the same parking lot offers complimentary Valet Parking....LOL.

When I walked up to the counter, there was no cashier present.  I stood and waited for a few minutes...and waited....and waited.  I finally snapped this photo because I was bored.

The food came out fast and accurate.  They were a little sloppy making the Bean Burritos as they had red sauce on the outside of the tortilla....which makes for a sloppy meal.  I would've expected better service from a restaurant so close to PV.

Overall, it wasn't too bad, but it was inconsistent.

{"text":"Time for a review update.  They no longer serve the Cheesy Bean & Rice Burrito, so I had to substitute one of my favorite menu items with a Bean Burrito.  This is in my neighborhood, so when I'm looking for a quick meal, I stop by here.

The employees working here are usually very friendly.  There's a kid that works on the weekends that's always super friendly and tries to upsell me on various new items they have....pretty funny guy.

It can get busy here on Friday nights when Desert Mountain HS plays their home football games, so if you see a ton of cars and people in there on a Friday, you know what's going on.

I still get my usual order....7 Layer Burrito, 2 Bean Burritos.  It's good for a quick fill up.

{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to this Taco Bell.  I dropped in for lunch yesterday and had great service from the cashier Juan.  He was friendly, patient, and made sure the order was correct.  He also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in.  He should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees don't give a **** about their job or customers.

My food came out fast and accurate.  I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.  The only knock on it was that the Bean Burritos were messy.  When they wrapped them, they got red Sauce all over the outside of it...so the Sauce got on my hands.  Oh well, that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush.

{"text":"This is probably the worst Taco Bell I've ever encountered, but it's near my neighborhood and I work late.. so, I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt, hoping they get their act together. 

It's rare that they get my order right. I often have to remind the person in the drive-thru to give me my drink or my change.  And they regularly run out of ingredients or menu items. Last week they were out of beef. BEEF?!? Do you know how much of the Taco Bell menu contains beef? Most of it. 

And sometimes they are 'closed' hours early. The lights are on and employees are still inside, but they aren't open for business. I can only assume the staff is waiting to clock out at 2:00 AM, but they no longer want to do any work. 

Not much you can do. I just shrug and go home hangry."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Keilah (probably spelled it wrong) she was so horrible! Rolling of the eyes, very quick and rude. She didn't even use sentences! Just literally said our total gave us the card back and shut the window! There wasn't a time she said thank you or anything! I asked for no ice in my drink and I saw her put ice in the cup...so when she was handing it over I asked if she could do no ice, rudely she shuts the window dumps out the drink and with her lips plumped up starts filling up my cup...once we got our food I said \"thank you try to have a better night\" and with the most high pitched upbeat voice she said \"thank you!\" It was like she was trying to fight/argue with her customers...she needs to go, with service as bad as that...Taco Bell at this location will be losing there customers...I'm definitely not coming back to this one...she seems like the type that will only be nice to the pretty boy looking guys...zero stars from me..."}
{"text":"I have never seen a sloppier taco made, Just got my 3 tacos, ready to eat lunch...looks like they used half a teaspoon of meat and threw in some lettuce for fun! And I paid for it too - never going to that place again"}
{"text":"Oh please, this is Taco Bell. I often ask myself why did I bother coming here to eat. It then dawns on me that its cheap and delicious. 

Service: Drive thru vs. Dine in. Either way its on you. Its up to you to know if you want additional sauce, soft shell tacos, and other behind the counter goodies. 

Interior: Its your typical franchised dining and marketing props. Lets face it there isn't much here however finding a seat is never an issue here.

Food: My personal favorite is the crunchwrap supreme. However here at this Taco Bell it was more like a soggywrap blunder. There was barely any meat, hardly any cheese, an over load of dry vegetables, and a soggy shell inside. I was pretty disappointed with the prepwork on such easy food. My girlfriend had the Cantina Chicken which she had stated was lacking meat which was rubbery, lacked any advertised taste, and had too much salsa filler. 

Overall this Taco Bell can do better. I hope they improve. I may return once my intestines agree with this choice of food."}
{"text":"Came through the drive thru tonight and was greeted by Jerry. A-1 customer service!!! Need more people like Jerry working at fast food chains!"}
{"text":"Dude are you kidding. They ran out of beef and lettuce and then proceeded to absolutely fuck up our order to the point where neither of us ate. Also it's just plain ridiculous that my nachos were literally, no exaggeration, a pile of crumbs. Literally most regretful waste of 22$ I have ever spent in my life. All of our cold disgusting food ended up in the garbage. What a disappointment, and that is a complement."}
{"text":"This place is awesome don't let the other customers with lower ratings fool you, yes this is not in a rich area. However all the employee's are always sweet and amazing. Especially people like Alyssa who simply tries and make people happy."}
{"text":"Ok foodies' don't judge me to harshly. Had to meet a coworker for a quick meeting. This store it clean, well run and filled with high profile biz folks in a hurry. 

While the chain is improving the their reputation globally as possible this store showcases that a fast food chain can deliver in a pinch. Great job."}
{"text":"Understaffed, slow, and disorganized. There is another Taco Bell down East Washington. You're better off going down the street.

I walked into this Taco Bell to grab some carry out for my wife and me. What should have been a 5 (maybe 10 minute on a busy day) visit turned into a 45 minute wait. The Taco Bell wasn't busy at all, but the employees were bickering behind the counter. 

After a 15 minute wait, I inquired where my food was. It appeared they lost my ticket? 15 minutes later, still no food. They lost my ticket again? After another 15 minutes food was eventually produced in a large bag containing way more than I ordered. I was told to check that everything was in there that I ordered and the rest was a \"bonus.\" The workers also gave me an extra fountain drink.

I appreciate the extra food, but this Taco Bell is poorly operated and understaffed. The workers need to stop fighting and the management shouldn't allow this behavior. It is greatly impacting the quality of service.

If it wasn't for the food quality still being horribly good and delicious, this review would have been a 1 star."}
{"text":"Went here in the morning and there was no line, yet the drive thru lady was very rude. Apparently I do not know how to order because she corrected me and told me the \"right way\" to better convience her. I have also visited this location at night because it's the only thing open. There is always a huge line for the drive thru that is always at least a half hour wait to get your sloppy broken tacos. Spend the extra for chipotle or try another location."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has the nicest employees. I usually go through the drive-thru, and they are very friendly. Yesterday I went inside, and again everyone was friendly. The inside is actually very pretty for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has got to be the slowest fast food place on earth. Already waiting 20 minutes for my order and still 4 orders away from getting mine. The place isn't busy and I've seen at least 10 cars go through already. I went inside to order after seeing a long ass line of cars. On top of that they aren't even past midnight like every other Taco Bell. Food is decent though, nothing different from your regular Taco Bell, if you ever get your food to even taste it that is"}
{"text":"In the realm of seedy, bloated, projectile defecation inducing, processed garbage called fast food; Taco Bell is my go to cure for those \"stoned out of my gourd and I need munchies,\" hours of the night. Unfortunately, like many of the other piss poor fast food restaurants in the neighborhood, this Taco Bell in particular excels in not providing their customers with the complete order. What a way to harsh your mellow. I was really looking forward to that beefy quesadilla...

Definitely check your bag."}
{"text":"Tasty food and the chalupa tacos are a must try! I drop the stars because for both the steak taco and supreme beef flatbread I ordered, I received about a teaspoon of meat in each. Definitely not good enough. If I wanted a veggie option, I wouldn't have gone for the steak!"}
{"text":"The workers were patient, even when all three of the kids we had with us could not make up their minds about what they wanted... lol  

Quick service, but there was a bit of a mix up... My boyfriend got a regular Doritos taco instead of the Cool Ranch one he ordered... They let him keep the incorrect one and then gave him the right one as well... That was pretty cool, in my opinion...  

High sanitation grade, so you know I was loving that! :)"}
{"text":"Happy that I can grab tacos super fast at this drive-thru! 
Tuesday Taco night is mandatory with my kids.... sometimes I just want to grab food and relax at home.
Never had an order incorrect. Remember to ask for sauce though, because they don't just toss it in. (Keeping down excessive cost and waste is good for everyone.)"}
{"text":"I don't bother reviewing fast food chain places unless there is something I really feel like I need to say...and today I do.

I've lived in a neighborhood where this is the closest Taco Bell for over five years...and I have kids. So they want tacos every so often.

And in all the times I've been to this place over the years, for late-night dinners, for offsite lunch during work, whatever, this particular location has impressed me in the long haul.

This Taco Bell has NEVER, not once, gotten my order wrong. I can't say that about any other fast food place ever.

This Taco Bell's employees have always been so polite, friendly, and kind that they may have given me diabetes.

These people do a job that is by comparison, pretty lousy, and they probably get abused by a lot of rude folks in town. But they deserve to know that their efforts are noticed and appreciated.

Hats off to the staff and management here, you are an example to the entire chain."}
{"text":"I been going to this location since last ten years now and my rating is based on my recent experience. Since last few months, new management is in place and that's the reason this place is getting four star. 

I remember my good old days at UNCC where me and my friends used to eat at TB twice a week, sometimes three times a week. That's the only place where we could get enough protein for two bucks lol.  
Even today, we go there once a week just to seat out on patio and talk about our good old days. 

This place is getting little out dated. Ever since Walmart and Best Buy left, all the business around this area is feeling the pain. Even Sam's Club manager told that they will be moving soon. 

Over all, they have good food and great service."}

I was heading to Huntersville and it was lunch time so I decided to grab a quick bite here and got me $5 box lunch with lot of protein.

It didn't took long for me to order with their friendly menu. I paid with my CC and fill up my drink. BAM! my order is ready. Now that's what I call fast food =)"}
{"text":"I know I am reviewing a chain but I had to let people know that skip this spot if you can because they don't make an effort to keep it clean. Even when they have enough employees.  

I stopped my here to pick up couple of items and since I am vegetarian, I always go in even if I am ordering to go that way I can check and make sure they didn't put meat in my order manually before I leave. Anyways, I noticed their soda machine area was pretty messy, tables were dirty and even man's room was not clean, I had to leave with out using it and I end up ordering at another location a mile down the road which is fairly new place and I guess it fits my standards LOL"}
{"text":"So I was doing little shopping during my lunch and I decided to stop by at TB for lunch to go. A man needs his protine even when he is vegetrain. 

I enter this place and WOW.. They seriously put in some money in this place with new furniture, decor and some cute new employees LOL

Anyways.. I get to the counter and I noticed that they have a new menu item called Cantina, so I asked the employee what's in it, surprisingly she knew it. I ordered it, hand over my CC and went to pick up my fav TB sauce and napkins. my order was called in and I made sure there is no meat added in order and I also made sure with the guy who made it. Finally I was on my way out.. I was out in less than ten minutes.

I was happy with order and their ability to get me out in ten minutes. That's what you call fast food :D"}

{"text":"Worst service ever! We waited over 15 minutes for 4 crunchy tacos and a bean burrito. When we got our order it should have been piping hot but it wasn't. We hardly ever go to Taco Bell and we won't be going to this one again. Laziest crew I've seen. Fast food? RIGHT."}
{"text":"I guess I lucked out when I went here, because they got my order correct, were friendly enough, and the food tasted just fine. From all of the one-star reviews, I guess I should have been hesitant to eat here, but things turned out just fine."}
{"text":"The slowest drive through ever. The guy in front of me took off and didn't even wait for his order. When I mentioned it too staff. He just said something about everyone ordering at least a dozen tacos... I'm used to the taco bell at the University they get big orders all the time. No excuse. 

But on the plus side the staff was friendly and well spoken. Aka they didn't look mad to be there or mad at you for being there."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch. It's s Taco Bell so expectations aren't super high, I would say this one is average for fast food, reasonably clean and average service. There are a few please food joints that kill it and a ton of them that are disgusting...this one is average or a tick above."}
{"text":"What's with all the bad attitudes Taco Bell?   Lady who takes orders in the drive thru was so rude and just trys to rush you as fast as she can like you're inconveniencing her or something.  Before you can even say what you want she's saying 'is that it?' 'anything else?'   Then I go to pay at the first window and there's no one there?  I sat there for 5 minutes while a huge line was forming behind me and no one in front of me so I just pulled up to the 2nd window after waiting forever and looking inside for any sign of life, and then little miss attitude comes rushing over telling me I was supposed to pay at the 1st window, where I was just sitting pointlessly for over 5 minutes while she was?  In the potty?  Who knows where?  The poor nice gay boy at the 2nd window did not deserve to be in the middle of her little tizzy.  He was very frightened.  He asked how much fire sauce I wanted and I said a small handful and he gave me 3 for 6 items lol.  After little miss attitude brought my card back, I drove away and noticed the nice gay boy only gave me 3 fire sauces but I don't blame him since attitude magee seemed to rattle him a bit, so I backed up and waved down a new boy at the window and asked very nicely if i could please get more fire sauce and the nice mexican boy gave me such a big handful of fire sauce that was so unnecessary and ridiculous and gave me the most unpleasant look ever.  A year supply though, thanks I guess?!  I know it's taco bell and it's toxic chemical food that I only get a few times a year when I'm feeling lazy, so it's not like I was expecting a great experience to begin with, but golly gosh goodness, not good taco bell."}
{"text":"This place is hysterical. Not only did they screw my order up, but they now apparently limit the amount of sauce they give per taco. I've not experienced this at any other location.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wait staff is mature and quick, They greet you right away, and its always clean inside. Customer service is great. Outa the dozens of times we have been here, our order is always correct Food is always proportioned good.My 2nd favorite in this town. Warm Springs and S.Durango is the best, they put enough meat, so you can taste it, and not all lettuce, like all the others I have been to."}
{"text":"Felicia G was very pleasant and a big smile. Fast food is a stressful and thankless job. Great to see such a positive attitude and a smile. People do notice."}
{"text":"Got the Doritos supreme tacos and a grilled wrap with a cherry limeade. The tacos were soggy and flavorless because of the sour cream. Next time, no sour cream. Grilled thing was so-so. Cherry limeade was tha bomb."}
{"text":"Ordered two tacos and a chalupa meal. Idk what girl was doing or who she was talking to, but was not paying attention at all to what was going on. Hands me my Pepsi, with the lid not on all the way, Pepsi leaking down the side. I got home, instead of my chalupa meal for my husband, I got some kind of burrito that is now dog food. I think it's a joke that people were protesting that fast food workers should get $15/hr. Do you think that person deserves that kind of pay? Bottom of the gene pool working there."}

Melanie is best in the drive thru, shes always really friendly and sweet.. must not be an az native! =)  Ive seen her like triple check my bag before- so shes really thurough. I usually dont go in to eat- havent in years since it was the go to munchie place when i was a teen. So I cant really comment on inside...but the drive thru has never been an issue - that and the food is consistent and good!"}
{"text":"I like this Taco Bell! It was completely renovated about 4-5 years ago after burning down so it's nice inside. Great flavor in the steak cantina bowl, $5, but I almost asked for more rice and lettuce cause they didn't really fill up the bowl. Love the new salsa verde packets!!!! They're by the hot sauce. Will be back of course."}
{"text":"The most horrible Taco Bell I've ever been too. I made my order and waited for her to take my separate order and didn't say anything for 5 mins. I finally drove up and waited for another 5 mins for her to answer the window for me just to repeat my second order in the pouring rain. Then messed up both orders and combined them into 1 full order when I clearly said 2! It takes about 30 minutes to get food here. Even if your the only one in line. Don't eat here. If I could give it 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"These dudes always give me as much fire sauce as I ask for. Every time I go to the drive through they're always very polite too. My friend has a crushed hardshell taco once but that was him not me and I went there 8x that week and they were all good.

Get the hardshell beef taco imho fam."}
{"text":"I came here on a mission to try nearly everything on the new dollar menu last week. I asked for two of everything minus a select few off their dollar cravings menu. For some reason, the cashier just couldn't understand that order. Aside from the multitude of order screw-ups, here's my top choices if you're feeling hungry and can't decide:

8. Spicy tostada - maybe it's because I saved this until the end, but it didn't really do it for me. Flat taco shell sprinkled with some cheese and diced tomatoes. Pass

7. Triple layer nachos - there were more stale tortilla chips without sauce than with. 

6. Cheesy roll-up - exactly as it sounds, but strangely satisfying, especially with their multitude of hot sauces.

5. Shredded chicken mini quesadilla - pretty good, but the beef is better.

4. Cinnamon twists - this really should be in the top 3 because come on, what visit to Taco Bell isn't complete without these babies?

My Top 3 must-gets: 
3. Beefy Fritos burrito - this is the best bang for your buck on the entire menu. A decent sized burrito stuffed with beef, nacho cheese sauce, rice, and corn chips. Except, the corn chips got soggy pretty fast.

2. Nacho fries - isn't this why you came here? The fries are well seasoned and fried. The nacho cheese sauce has a kick and is the proverbial icing on the cake, or I guess cheese on the fry.

1. Beefy mini quesadilla - this was my favorite of the bunch. More beefy flavor than the chicken and has an all-around more satisfying bite."}
{"text":"Walked in cuz the drive thru was long.  The cashier was a young girl and standing next to her behind the counter was a young guy, looks like he worked there but finished his shift. So anyway while looking at the menu I noticed them flirting w each other, leaning on him, giggling and rubbing his arm like she's checking his muscles... you know, doing the young and dumb thing. So I had to interrupt them so I could order. I got the cravings meal and 2 soft taco Supremes,  after quickly taking my order so she could go back to squeezing his twig arms, I paid, got my food, and went home.  Of course they got my order wrong. I got 2 regular soft tacos and not supremes. If she was more attentive to her \"job\" she wouldn't have screwed it up.  The management needs to keep an eye on these kids... like a day- care"}
{"text":"Obviously I am not alone in stating this is the WORST KFC ***POOR MANAGEMENT*** - If they do get your order correct the chicken is usually dried out - Employees are unprofessional and act as if you are an inconvenience to their day.  I have given this place 4 attempts and have always been disappointed.  I will not be going back!  I know they just remodeled however when they removed the debris they forgot the management."}
{"text":"Back again and nothing has changed.  Came in and waited at front counter for almost 10 min while employees stayed in the kitchen area with no focus on waiting front counter customers."}
{"text":"I like this location because it is close to home.  I get lucky and get some nice coupons too!  I have really enjoyed the Starburst Icees that they make.   I think of it as a high end slurpee!  If you catch it right, you can get a med for $1 between 2pm and 5pm.  The reason for the three star is 3 out of every five orders is wrong or incomplete.  You really have to check you bag carefully before you leave.  I believe this may be a training location.  Also the drive thru can be very busy and slow."}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing Taco Bell? I like this particular Taco Bell because it also is a combined Pizza Hut. 
I like to get pizza on the go when I am in a hurry, so this is pretty convenient for me. What I do not like is that they ALWAYS mess up my order here. I can't even count how many times I've had to walk back into the store and ask for them to fix it. 
One time, they asked me to pull in front of the store to wait for my pizza because it was still baking for about five more minutes. If I wanted to wait for my pizza I wouldn't have come to a FAST food joint. If you don't have it ready, tell met that so I don't have to wait and be late getting back to work. Anyway, I ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes before I walked into the store just to find out that they completely forgot about me. I had already paid and everything! 
I do love that they have Mountain Dew Baja Blast at this location."}
{"text":"Sanitation score of 99.5 which is impressive. However, the service is awful. Cashier was rude. No name tag but receipt says Terry D. I just chose to come eat here, not deal with your attitude along with it. 

Their interaction with customers is appalling. You know you have to have respect for those that help pay you. Be thankful for the job you have or leave it."}
{"text":"So on a Friday night at 9:30 pm they decide to close the drive through and the dinning room. No sign on the door. I guess they just went fishing."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service at this location. One of the employees threw his arms up in the air and yelled \"really\" as my  family left because apparently he thought we should have got on the floor to clean up the lettuce and tomatoes that our toddler spilled."}
{"text":"This KFC taco bell has the slowest drive-thru I have ever been through.... it's been like this for years."}
{"text":"Friendly workers, but they must have little to no training.  Obviously this is a drunken weekend pick, but even drunks have some standards for fast food.  When you order, you must specify all the ingredients you want.  So if you order a chicken quesadilla, you must tell them you want the \"tortilla with chicken, cheese and sauce.\"  If not you will get a few piecesl of chicken on a tortilla - if that. They do not know how to properly make the products they are paid to serve. Also, expect half of what you order. Every time I have ordered, I have gotten only half the order, ie: you order a quesadilla and it is all scooped onto one side so it is half plain tortilla half your actual order.  Again, nice people, just bad at their jobs or they hate you so much to spite you with a tablespoon of cheese on a bare tortilla."}
{"text":"Dont waste ur time here, they will get ur order wrong and as much time as it takes for you to get ur food (its a what the fuck moment) its RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"I stopped by this location tonight to pick up dinner for someone and they were surprisingly nice. Normally in the drive through they are sneaking \"meows\" in or other teenage jokes. Although annoying, it is not enough to stop me from going to the convenient location 3 minutes from my house. Tonight was a different story. While eating the bean burrito I picked up, the person stopped chewing and I asked what was wrong, assuming the messed up again and put onion in his no onion bean burrito. When he finally put his fingers up to his lips and pulled out a piece of metal from his mouth I was shocked. He immediately threw the other food away, which was over half of everything I had picked up. I am thankful that he felt the metal before he swallowed it. I didn't even bother going up to complain because the location is run by immature 16 year olds who would have laughed it off and given me a new burrito."}
{"text":"BOOOOOOOOOOOOO (inhale) BOOOOOOOOO"}
{"text":"Quick and never get the order wrong. I've never had to check my bag before I leave. Everyone that works there is nice."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is good itself but I ordered 3 supreme tacos but only given two pks of sauce.  I parked one minute away to eat them.  Two tacos were sticking to the wrapper and the other fell apart from the bottom.  Never had any to stick to the passer at any location.  I'm guessing to much sauce in the taco meat or the food sat too long before handed through the window."}
{"text":"Pretty good Taco Bell overall, but the chalupas are never crispy enough, no one likes a soggy stale chalupa :/ just wish they'd fry them a little longer but yeah otherwise it's a good late night stop for those nights when I get off late and just want some grub. Hope they'll work on this, if I start getting crispy chalupas I may give a better rating and review, fingers crossed"}
{"text":"I like the new $5 meals, make me full and is very tasty. Very good for Mexican American fast food. Though sometimes I think the young folks don't appreciate a job, because one night I ordered a chicken quesadilla that came with bits and pieces of chicken"}
{"text":"I stopped by this specific Taco Bell today since the other nearby location further north on Rancho Drive near Big Dog's Draft House is currently located in a slow-going and stressful construction zone with road work being performed.

The menu has gotten to be so extensive at Taco Bell with all sorts of combinations, options and specials available nearly all the time that it's quite overwhelming to make the right choice.

Thus, I radically simplified the decision making process by picking a currently advertised special - a Chalupa box with included beverage. And yes I must confess: it was naked and quite tasty too!

I find that Mexican food with whatever spin you may want to give it is just the thing for a change-of-pace meal to break the seemingly endless fastfood chain of burgers, chicken and the like.

Taco Bell - the franchise leader in this type of cuisine - consistently provides its customers with a needed pick-me-up of this kind very successfully."}
{"text":"Very horrible nobody doing anything and yelling kiss my ass to employees and bathroom smells like garbage"}
{"text":"Came here last night I would not recommend coming here I waited 20 minutes for my order and I end up getting sick don't come here"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is really just the worst ... From the wait times to the way they constantly screw up your order. And let's hope they actually have the drink you want in stock otherwise you'll have to settle for something else. Please make sure to check your bag before you leave otherwise you'll be missing a thing or two ."}
{"text":"Slow as hell rude workers with attitude dirty bathroom and floor come on guys keep it clean manager are rude last time I'm coming here and they didn't give me the Dbacks special I wait in the drive through for long time manger try to argue with me about my order not being right and employees eating out where the food was kept and yelling bad language across the dining room manger argue with employees saying kiss my ass to manager gm sat there let happen and didn't say sorry to people for letting that happened alan the big boss sit there let happen"}
{"text":"I love this Taco Bell. The staff is always awesome any time of the day.they are fast friendly every single time. I'm surprised with the rating they have. I love it and they handle problem people perfectly. See it first hand. And even when they leave I don't see them talking bad about them I think is amazing how professional they are most people when you leave talk about you I've seen that. 

Great job everyone"}
{"text":"Food was great but the drive threw girl gave me 1 napkin and 3 hot sauce for my meal that had 2 hard tacos and 1 crunch wrap seriously. I couldn't even really enjoy it. I can't be going back waisting my lunch time on getting napkins and hot sauce do you just use 3 sauce smh"}
{"text":"*Naked Chicken Chalupa Review

Overall: Would buy again, just make sure you use a coupon ( I think they have a list of them right infront of the cashier) because the Naked Chicken Chalupa is expensive AF!

Food: 4.5/5 - My experience with the Naked Chicken Chalupa was nothing short of divine. It was a perfect creation that could only be improved by adding beef. The shell (fried chicken) was perfectly breaded (as good as McNugget breading) and seasoned just right. There was cheese, lettuce and tomatoes inside and also some special sauce made for the Chalupa. We had to wait a little bit for our order but that was only because they fried the shell for us right there, and when it came out it was nice and hot. Overall it was majestic, revolutionary and celestial.

Price: 2/5 - The Naked Chicken Chalupa was $5 each. If we're talking about fast food buying power I could have gotten nearly 3 Jr. Chickens for the same price of one NCC. It is advised that you purchase the Combo, which includes a drink, burrito, the NCC, fries supreme, and I think an apple pie for $9.50."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. I've been there a handful of times over the past few months and have left with a complaint every single time. I've had forgotten items, terrible quality food, poor customer service, overcharging for items and rude manager interactions. The incompetence of the staff and management is mind boggling. Tonight was the final straw and I will never return to this location. Taco Bell is my favorite fast food restaurant and it's such a disappointment to have to be so negative about a great chain. 

For Taco Bell fans, it's very worth it to take the extra drive to the West View or the McKnight road location. Do not dine at this location, I guarantee you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I come to this Taco Bell every once in a while and i haven't had a bad experience so far, the food is usually well prepared and the customer service is good or excellent. It's better than some other Taco Bell's I've gone too in my opinion mainly for cleanliness and customer service. Also they usually acknowledge the wait times and you can tell they keep that in mind. Drive-thru is always a great experience, from the runners having a funny conversation with me while I wait for my food to them giving me free drinks to compensate for the wait times."}
{"text":"NEVER. AGAIN. 

10 minutes in the drive through. 17 minutes at the counter inside. 

We had to flag someone down to come take our order? 15 minutes waiting for that order to be filled? The order was WRONG when we got it. Also, they need to check out the soda machine - you shouldn't smell rotten fish when pouring a Baja Blast."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this location was two days ago, and they were missing half my order. Once they corrected the missing items, I get back to my employment and notice they put chicken in my chalupa instead of beef. I returned today, two days later and they recognized me. First thing they asked me was if they messed up my order from last time and replied yes with the explanation. The man who seems like he would be the manager, was making our food and when he brought it to us, he said he made sure everything was correct. One lady who worked the take our window asked the manager if he could refund us our money since they had us pay again for the same meal as last time, but the manager never took initiative and walked away. When I got back to my employer, again, we were missing two items from our bags. I called them explaining to them I was he same person you messed up again and they said sorry and hung up the phone. Best customer service ever. Never going back since they've taken money from me twice!"}
{"text":"Find any other Taco bell if possible. Or DelTaco at 91st. Worst in the valley! I've had several problems with food quality at this location. Ex: They have put my Mexican pizza under the rest of my food smashing it, The soda has been straight syrup. Food tastes old and gross. Never Hot or fresh. Inside is very dirty. Also this store is pitch black at night so you don't even know they are open past 9.

 I've called and complained to management to be told my order would be replaced. I arrived 10 days later to be told I need to come in before 7 days or they wouldn't replace anything. The manager even recalled the incident! 

Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"AVOID! Terrible wait times at night. Staff appears confused regularly. I gave this location multiple chances. Closes before posted times. Avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! Just left the drive thru and waited 30+ minutes for nothing. By the time I pulled up to the window, I wasn't even in the mood for tacos since I was pissed. I asked them what the hold up was...her answer was \"busy day.\" What happened to the phrase fast food? I could have cooked a meal myself in 15 minutes so what was the point of going to a fast food restaurant? She then tried to offer a desert item but the whole meal should have been free. 

Will not return to this location since this was not the first time nor will it be the last time they take 30 minutes I can't get back. Try your luck on Craig or the Ann location."}
{"text":"Really need to update the times this place stays opened!!...2am on Friday & Saturday... Try only til 11pm...
Fail!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in the staff is always. Cheery, polite and attentive to the order. There is a small wait normally, just drink your beverage which they try and get to you pretty quickly.  The new Chalupa box is a great value and tasty."}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest service of any fast food restaurant in town. Not sure why it takes them so long, but it's always a problem here."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is quite possibly my favorite fast food restaurant but I've never had a good experience at this location. My order is wrong 50% of the time and they are less than enthusiastic about fixing it when you bring an error to their attention."}
{"text":"Wow.  Love Taco Bell but have had terrible experiences the last two times we went. Just waited half an hour to get to the window and not even have our food ready.   Completely unacceptable.  Last time I paid for all steak tacos and got beef instead.. I'll drive to Cave Creek and Cactus next time."}
{"text":"This location is always closed.  I get that things happen. I also get that no one wants to cook after hours. This is my second review.  This place is terrible.  Their system is always down. Good luck getting good here."}
{"text":"Firstly the service was very slow for fast food. Secondly when we looked in the bag there was no receipt and the order was completely wrong. Also the food looked like it was wrapped by a child. When we tried to get it fixed they were \"closed\". Who ever the female working at 945 on Tuesday 11/7/17 please make sure you give your customers the correct order and the receipt to go with the order. Take the extra time to provide your customers the experience that would make them want to come back."}
{"text":"So this is my first time eating at Taco Bell where my order was messed up. I ordered a power veggie bowl no beans + onions, jalapeños, lettuce, and tomatoes. When I got home and opened it up, they had everything there except what actually comes with the bowl like guacamole, sour cream, pico de Gallo, cheese, and avocado ranch sauce. Literally wtf? Who works there and forgets how to make a fucking power veggie bowl? With all the key ingredients, this location sucks."}
{"text":"Worst taco bell ever. Lady in the drive through charged me for wrong order, and then couldn't give me a refund because I paid with credit card. Called DM and he told me I could get free food next time , I went and no free food . This place is run by poorly trained staff"}
{"text":"They have  Taco Bell in Canada too?? I was happy to see it.  The food was well decent and as expected."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a large Baja Blast \"SODA\" at about 8:30pm 6/14/16, they gave her the freeze version instead. When she corrected them on the matter, they proceeded to argue with her and said because it was on the order screen that they wouldn't correct the matter!! This is ridiculous NONSENSE!!! She's an RN and just finished a 12 hour shift and didn't notice it had said freeze at the end, she wasn't in the mood to argue with them... but I AM!!! Why does food restaurants want to argue with what a customer wanted!?!? She didn't order or say the word freeze and didn't even ask about a freeze... So why did they enter it or bother to confirm which version she wanted, also why do they insist on saying she WANTED A FREEZE!? Do your job people and don't assume to know what people want, the fact that they want more than minimum wage makes me laugh, most of the fast food workers don't deserve what they're making now, as I'm constantly finding them screwing up my order! Like just the other day, after picking my wife up from work at the hospital, we went to the McDonalds off 7th st. and McDowell. They forgot to give us a 10 piece chicken nugget for my kids, we didn't find out till we got home which was clear in Scottsdale off Miller Rd, after looking at the receipt it turns out we actually paid for it. It's not even an isolated case, it's become common place for these incompetent fast food employees to screw up at least ONE thing every time we try to eat somewhere.
   I'm calling the manager of this TacoBell as soon as I'm done, because poor customer service is unacceptable! Don't let these people walk all over you because of THEIR MISTAKES!!!"}
{"text":"Omgoodness 20 min wait in drive-thru and no apology! And then they got my sons drink wrong. I would have gone in if we hadn't had the baby w/ us."}
{"text":"This is the dumpiest Taco Bell/KFC in the city. The speaker in the drive-thru is so bad that the employee and I had to repeat ourselves three times back and forth to get my order taken. 

Despite the crap-tastic look of the place, the food is on par to other locations. Also, despite the terrible drive-thru speaker, they've never messed up my order. So there's that."}
{"text":"The manager here just helped me out sooo much! She was beyond sweet & super pleasant ! She completely turned my attitude that I had towards her around lol.  So grateful she was able to help me thank you so much ! She's a doll"}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza tonight around 8pm. I was happy when the kid working said he threw in an extra one for free. It was obviously because the pizza was old. Waste of money. My 9 year couldn't even eat it. They were obviously too lazy to make fresh ones."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is good for lots of food at a good value, after a night of drinking, soft food after having a tooth or teeth pulled, and for just an occasional craving. The bean and cheese burrito is about the only thing that is decent. Everything on the menu is just blah! If you are looking for a culinary delight, this place is not it. The customer service is generally not bad and the food is given in a speedy manner."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous to come here because of the reviews but I really wanted a taco so I decided to give it a go on my lunch break! Hands down the best Taco Bell experience I have ever had. I didn't not go inside so I don't know what if it's nice/clean in there but the Drive thru was quick and easy! The Drive-thru employee was super funny and accurate with the order! The food was very fresh and still very hot after my 15 minute travel back to the office! 

I mean, I know it's Taco Bell, but if it's delicious, cheap, and hits the spot, what's wrong with writing a review? ;-)

I got the chicken doubledilla combo which is my fave & I added on a crunchy taco. All of the items were fresh and delicious! Definitely give this location a try for lunch!"}
{"text":"Despite my best efforts, I like Taco Bell. 

Yeah, I've heard the rumors. The \"D\" Grade Meat, the cockroach stories. I'm skeptical of all of them, but moreso because I don't want to believe them.

I acknowledge that TB is not even remotely close to what is classically considered healthy. But what about health of mind and spirit? What can deliver that better than deep fried cheesy goodness of Taco Bell?

Not buying it? It was worth a shot. 

Here's My Point: I actually believe that the \"deciders\" (yeah, I said it) or head chefs that create and select the temporary specialty items for Taco Bell have something going on. The Double Decker Taco? The Cheesy Gordita Crunch? The Supreme Chalupa??? These were all creative and tasty pieces of America's culinary history. In the gross, fast food section."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is one of those dual restraunts where it's a Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut. I got the PH1 combo. That includes a supreme personal pan pizza, breadsticks, and a medium drink. The breadsticks were perfect. And the medium drink was the same size as a large from McDonalds. The pizza. Well. It was soggy for starters. And after A few bites I realized the dough was still raw. Like sticky dough, uncooked. I ended up tossing the entire pizza after that. I was very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Terrible attention to detail. We ordered 3 tacos with no lettuce due to a food allergy (weird I know, but actually true) and two Mexicalis. Not only did they give us lettuce, they also did not give us our Mexicalis. It sucks cause they are one of the only Taco Bell's open late, buuuut this is not the fist time they simply did not pay attention to our orders. And yes, there was a screen they asked us to verify that was correct. I guess they figure if it's a late order you are drunk or high and don't care. Very sad. Will not go back. Do yourself a favor and just get pizza. #thinkINsidethebun"}
{"text":"These are my favorite tacos. I know it's silly, but it's the best taco ever. Crispy ingredients and fresh taste. 

The staff here is fair as well as the service center but the taste is consistent from store to store"}
{"text":"Does not take American Express..what the hell? Door signs all say they do and as every other Taco Bell I have been to for 20 years. Stay Away."}
{"text":"Morning crew is good, they usually have nice service and are quick. Afternoon is the worst. They always mess up my order, they're slow, and they're rude. Don't come here past noon! Only doing two stars since the morning shift is good."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave one stars. And at that, at a CHAIN restaurant! But I had lunch here today @ this location and I haven't left my bathroom!  Pretty sad because this messed it up for me.  Mind you I came during peak lunch hour & still got sick. Go to another location."}
{"text":"Don't come to this location if you actually want quick service. I've been several times, and my minimum wait has been around 10 minutes in the drive thru. Tonight I've been in line for roughly 15, enough time to log into yelp and type in this review."}
{"text":"Sometimes good services sometimes messes up the orders. Food is not great. The mgrs r good the employees who work late at night black lady is rude. All in all ok very par for Taco Bell"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell to death but today was not my lucky day.
I was planning to order on the Breakfast menu but I came just as they flipped the menu.  Breakfast is only served before 11 am and I would have been ok if only they didn't forget my order.
Stood in front of the cashier for 10 min. and proceeded to order:

----Fiesta Potatoes:  It was amazing and so worth $1.29.  I should have ordered more.

----Beefy 5 layer burrito:   Burrito was ok, not the best but satisfying.

----Deal A- Shredded Chicken Burrito with a medium drink and doritos:  My sister Ella(10) said she liked it but was disappointing that I didn't get her breakfast.

----Deal B- Double Decker Taco with a medium drink and dritos:  My other sister Johndra(13) loved it and wondered why she's never had it befor.

Cinnamon Twists and Cinnabon(4)-  where missing.

I only realized they forgot my order on the Twists and Cinnabon once I was at home but other than that, I love Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Ate here while staying at the siena suites, food was ok compared to other taco bells I've ate at in the past. The night before leaving this year I got 2 chalupas with only cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. Needless to say I recieved a salad with a side order of chalupa.. I understand they use this as a filler but when there is enough lettuce to actually make a salad between the two.. you might have used too much. I called and complained and was told to come back for a free meal but I'm from out of town and left before they were open.  

I'd still go here but more than likely wouldn't order a chalupa assuming that's how they make them here, everyone else's food was good except for mine."}
{"text":"The staff here was absolutely incredible.  Was passing through here on a trip, and the way this store was managed made me smile.  Everyone I spoke with was great, the food was prepared correctly, and the store was clean and pristine.  One of the best Taco Bell experiences of all time!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell. I don't know that there's anything really to say that you wouldn't already know. 

This location is set back from McDowell, and has an awkward drive through. The staff is always nice, and I've never had anything messed up with my order. I have never been inside to see about its cleanliness, etc. The location is a really old building,  and it shows. 

My tacos always, always fall apart. Who knows, they may not have been in one piece when I got them, but it makes for a difficult eat. I love the Doritos Nacho supreme tacos too much to admit. I also am a fan of the proprietary Mountain Dew Baja Blast, even though I'm not a MD fan at all. I also love those little caramel empanadas. Yum. 

Fast, cheap and edible. Why not?"}
{"text":"Taco bell is getting ridiculous! I just went there got the new loaded taco burrito and it had such a skimpy amount of meat. Nothing like what they put in the pictures or on tv. Also i ask for mild sauce i had got 3 burritos and she gives me 2 mild sauces! What the hell is wrong with people"}
{"text":"Fast food joint.. come on. Its good. the cashier who happened to be the Manager was very Happy"}
{"text":"I hate Taco Bell , don't like the food , don't like the wait , get for wife here and there , they ALWAYS FORGET UR drink always skimp on sauce yuck yuck yuck !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location has gotten better at accuracy but sooooooo sloooow!! 
I ordered with the app, when I pulled in app said food was being prepared.
It wasn't even started. ?.
I stood for about 10 minutes waiting.
At least at chipotle when you have too wait they offer you a beverage.
Not here.
If you use the app you'll still wait a long time."}
{"text":"Came in at 2:40 in the midst of a trying day for done well needed food. Tyler greeted me and my day got better :) polite and pleasant he didn't bat an eye with my meatless order and was very helpful. Thanks for the bright spot Tyler!!!"}
{"text":"Never wrote a review on fast food places but this one is little special for my family. Manager lady is very kind person and really friendly. I love seen her have my day better."}
{"text":"Terrible costumer service!!!!!! No greeting (even though we tried to say hi) and when we tried to verify our couple of regular items we're GF, the rude employee replied \"nothing here is gluten free\". Well sir, corporate Taco Bell begs to differ. We spoke to the manager who obviously didn't care, and walked out. WON'T be back to this location ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Went tonight and got tacos. About one teaspoon of meat and filled with lettuce and a little cheese. Worst tacos ever. I guess it depends on the worker or maybe now they are just making lettuce and a little cheese tacos. Used to be good there."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever ....

I would give it zero if that was an option.

30 minutes later .... and I still never got my food.

And it's supposedly FAST food?"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Taco Bell?
Usually the employees really blow but everyone here actual knows what they are doing and are polite courteous and get your food to you in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Love the Crunchwrap. We get the California even though it's not showing on the menu. It has Guacamole and so it's not a extra. I had the Grande Scrambler. All quick tasty and priced right."}
{"text":"comfy and   clean and well-kept as fast food restaurants go .it has a nice modern decor.The employees are always very nice and polite and helpful with our special orders as we ordered my wife's wonderful Crunchwrap all special made."}
{"text":"Made a yelp just to write this review. It was that bad. Save yourself and don't go here. The worst fast food place I have ever been to. They make it seem like rocket science and can't get anything right. Asked for shredded chicken, paid extra for it, and got beef. Had to toss the whole thing. And not to mention that I had to wait for someone to answer the drive-thru com and an additional 15 minutes for my food. There was no one else in line!! All I heard was yelling, laughing, jokes being cracked and I waited there. Maybe they need to do a basic skills test before they hire because it's ridiculous. Last time I made a taco it was pretty easy... I'm sure my dog could even do it."}
{"text":"We are huge Taco Bell fans and have grown up eating Taco Bell our entire lives.  While driving on our road trip, we stopped at this location for an early dinner, and we truely dissapointed and sad.  We ordered two Mexican pizzas and some tacos and when we got our food, one pizza was made correctly and the other one barely had any ingredients on it and was not made properly.  We took that pizza back and asked them to remake this, which they did. 
When eating the pizzas, we immediately got a horrible taste in our mouth.  It was very bad and tasted like we were eating chemicals.  We could not believe this and had to throw it all away.  Due to this we did not feel comfortable eating anything else from this restaurant and had to leave.  Such a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"If zero was possible I would give it. Raggedy AF. Sit here and listen to these workers openly talk about the 2 workers that just walked outside that they're going to smoke but they had a break already and should be making orders. Meanwhile she's on her phone and brings chips to the register. Shes eating them between orders and looking at her phone. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I give 5 stars because they have a really nice staff. The cashier was extremely patient and friendly. One of the kitchen girls offered me a free drink and it was a heel of me not to accept it. Food is in great quality and fresh. I like that and be coming in again to this location. Very nice staff and professional service."}
{"text":"1:40 pm 1/12/15, I always have pleasant day with this Taco Bell location. Typical busy hour, quick, grab and Go. Ordered beef cheddar crunch-wrap slider, and mango fiesta. It was hot, crunchy and delicious. I don't really know how people think about Taco Bell, but with Staff like ROBERT, I had better understanding how important to show our friendliness to our guest is matter. This location is the best in Las Vegas area by far. Thank you for the all staff and Robert, keep it up and God job!"}
{"text":"Average Taco Bell. Nothing special compared to most other Taco Bells. I've never had any troubles here and it's a good place to stop for something to eat."}
{"text":"My neighborhood Taco Bell. I've never had a negative experience here, although one time my Mexican pizza shell tasted a bit outdated. Staff has always been nice, and I don't believe my order has ever been wrong. Open late Friday and Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell what can we say.  We have been here a couple times but the last two time we have waited extremely long times in the drive thru. 

If you on a lunch break go to Roberto's. It's just not worth it.  Last wait time was 36 min if there had not been a. At in front or back of us we would have just left."}
{"text":"Taco Bell and there Crunch wraps. The end. 

This location is good and it provides what a fast food service provides. Sure their may be moments where things may be out but it's a restaurant sometimes orders don't come and they may be out of things.
It's not a big deal."}
{"text":"I don't leave 5 stars.  I just don't.  This location has its problems.  Sometimes it's difficult to find a parking spot.  Often, it's difficult to find a seat that is clean.  The back of house staff at times struggles with your order however,  the front of house staff is incredible.  Taco Bell employs quite a few special needs workers to attend to their front of house needs.  They may stand and talk to you during your entire meal and sweep under your feet 50 times while you are eating, but I find the interaction quite enjoyable.  They also tend to gravitate right towards my bother, who is completely, socially awkward himself and avoids everybody when possible.  And every time we eat there my brother talks for hours about the girl at Taco Bell.  It's a nice touch, nice touch."}
{"text":"Despite being in the ghetto, this Taco Bell isn't too bad. The people who work here seem depressed, but at least they were polite and my order was processed quickly and accurately. I just wish the post by the checkout line didn't give way when I leaned against it. It's like it's connected to the rail, but not secured to the floor. The food here was decent but seemed to be lacking in flavor. I ordered a burrito supreme and two soft tacos, (which is what I often get), but they didn't taste as good as they normally do. As I left the building, there were a few shady characters hanging out in the parking lot. I thought they were going to ask for my change (which is a common practice on this side of town), but surprisingly they didn't."}
{"text":"Back when I lived on the east coast, I used to think Taco Bell was absolutely awesome. That all changed when I moved to Arizona. After trying some \"authentic\" Mexican food, Taco Bell just hasn't been the same to me, but I will still go every now and then.

This particular location is located in a good part of town, is clean, and has nice employees. Last time I was here, I tried the Steak and Potato Burrito (or whatever it was called). It was alright. Not the greatest, but not the worst thing I've ever tried.  Definitely better than the junk they have on the dollar menu!"}
{"text":"Came to eat, ordered (2) 5 layer beefy burritos, and (2) bean burritos. The portion was very good, and they filled the tortilla with beans. When I usually order burritos from other taco bells you can never tell whether to buy more because if they give meager portions. Staff was courteous to other customers. Employees took time during slower times to clean up the area. Very well satisfied. I've been to this location almost a dozen times."}
{"text":"This place is the worst Taco Bell west of the Mississippi. I hope whoever owns this franchise get his taco hell privileges revoked. If your freeze machine is down everyday... INVEST IN A NEW ONE!!! What's the point of going to Taco Bell without freezes? Should change name to dell taco."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 hard shell taco supremes got plain hard shell tacos charged for supreme & now they don't awnser to fix my order! Ridiculous"}
{"text":"They got the order wrong- got burritos instead of tacos. Then this guy hassles me in the drive through for free food when I tell him I'm sorry he goes over to another car behind me and starts shouting then this same guy just sits down in front of my car and glares and gestures at me. I point him out to the person at the window and they act like its no big deal and tell me he \"always just  hangs around a lot and hits people up for free food including the employees.\""}
{"text":"They have a pretty good location and convenient for in and out.  Everyone's familiar with Taco Bell's menu, however, something they've had for awhile is \"Happy Hour\". They have many freezees, Taco burrito grillers, and drinks for $1 from 2-5, everyday.  The freezes are a good item for a cool summer refreshment.  

Be mindful of the drive-thru at the location. Once, you're in, you're in. You're not able to leave out of the drive-thru because there's not another lane to the right to drive around. 

Also, the location is right next to a new authentic Mexican restaurant, but Taco Bell will still be left standing."}
{"text":"This place is your average fast food. 50/50 chanve you will het your food right. There employees all seem miserable and like they hate their jobs. A smile and a thank you would goes a long way in the service industry."}
{"text":"I love taco bell but my expectations are never as high as i expect the drive through guy is.  This location is actually suprising. They are fast, friendly and have never messed up my order.  Best Taco Bell in town."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is an anomaly for Taco Bells and fast food restaurants in general. Food quality is always great and the customer service is stellar. Although sometimes their opening line in the drive thru of \"hi there, hello there, how's it going out there\" sometimes drives me crazy I'll take it over an employee who doesn't care."}
{"text":"Lol...  Taco Bell...  Not much you can say about it because all the chains generally taste the same. It all boils down to weather you're a fan of it or not.  For me,  I like taco Bell way better than del taco, so this is my go to.  
 The reason why I decided to write about this place was because the place was so clean and the customer service was awesome! They have a good team working there,  so 5 stars from me :D"}
{"text":"Leaving a one star is giving this place too much credit. Why are there employees sitting down and talking loudly while the whole place is dirty? Literally no clean tables. Order was missing one item, employees were so unprofessional that one of the girls was screaming (or talking loudly if you prefer) to the other one: \"I look at you if I want to, I own you...\" I know it is just a Taco Bell and expectations may be low for this type of fast food restaurants but how hard is it to have a couple of tables clean (instead of us customers cleaning them up) and their employees behave professionally? Overall, avoid this TB location at all costs!"}
{"text":"When I asked for no tomatoe, I was assured no tomatoes on my burrito. But first bite in, it was packed with tomatoes. I don't understand what is so hard about not putting tomatoes."}
{"text":"Went back. Still can't get an order right. 

Also, employees standing outside smoking and taking my order, as a smoker, disgusts me."}
{"text":"The WORST Taco Bell location I've ever been to. Their service, wait times, and quality of food preparation has gone down over the past year. They can't get a simple taco supreme right, and they run out of basic ingredients (e.g. rice) at 10:00 pm...not sure how a place that is supposed to serve Mexican food runs out of key ingredients and doesn't know how to assemble a basic taco. I can't remember the last time I went there and had my order done right the 1st time; there's always the 2nd visit with them."}
{"text":"Family of three went last week.  The gentleman at the register, Keith, was very friendly.  We had a coupon and he was unsure of their procedure as it was his first day on the register.  He did let us know and apologized as he needed to get help.  The Manager, Bree, then proceeded to yell from the back on how to do it.  The directions did not appear to be clear so he went to her and asked for assistance.  She then came to the front and was extremely rude to him.  She talked down to him the entire time and then started entering information into their system without even explaining it to him.  We had three coupons and instead of letting us know that they couldn't be used in the same order in a friendly way, she stated that you can't use them but that's besides the point and I don't have time for this.  It appeared that she entered the information wrong in the system so Keith received help from another co-worker (didn't get her name) and she showed him the actual process.  I was embarrassed and humiliated for the Keith and the other co-worker and how this so-called manager was completely rude and unprofessional!  

Food was fine & order was accurate."}
{"text":"Newly opened location.  Like every other location as far as the food is concerned.  Staff was  friendly unlike the others.  This location was really clean!"}
{"text":"So to start out this review the employees were really rude and didn't really seem like they knew what they were doing, when I got my food it wasn't even in the proper wrappings or the box for the triple crunch wrap supreme deal I understand they run out of boxes but when I got home they didn't even wrap the god damn thing right.....15 dollars a hour my ass not worth that much a hour learn how to wrap things right appreciate it."}
{"text":"I have minimal expectations for this chain and they have been met. I have had to return to the restaurant many times after leaving the drive through to get my order fixed.  That would have to be my biggest complaint. On a positive note, the inside and outside of the building  is normally clean and tidy. They have always gotten my food out fast, which normally would be a plus if I didn't have to go back to get the order fixed. This location has a prime location due to the fact they have no competing venues with in miles of them."}
{"text":"It was about 11:15 at night and we decided to come to eat. As we pulled up we saw most of the employees out side smoking a blunt. It's so unprofessional and I will probably never come back. I don't need someone under the influence making my food."}
{"text":"EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to the drive thru they mess up my order. I live nearby so I've been many times and they not only mess it up but it usually doesn't taste as good as other Taco Bells"}
{"text":"Taco Bell, nothing unusual here. Fast food style Mexican ? food. There's more than 1 toilet in the ladies room and it's clean!"}
{"text":"Gotta give this place 4 stars for opening late. We just finished a wedding. Went to D&B for about an hour. Then we wanted a late night spot to chill. I swear, nothing is open late out here. Found this place and there were actually a lot of people there. 

There were a bunch of high school looking kids. The kids thought we came from Prom. lol.

anywho. Got some food. Taco bell is taco bell. Nothing crazy about quality of food."}
{"text":"I love TBell late at night. Shit, I should have frequent flyer miles at this point. I just sat in the drive thru for 25 minutes. If it wasn't for the old TI on the stereo I would have jumped out. My only hang up is the 10 bags of hot sauce I got. Jesus. Thx. 

Ps AM crunch wraps should be all the time Thx"}
{"text":"I'd like to say the night crew is awesome!!! I would like Taco Bell to recognize a couple of their young ladies that work the 11pm shift. Vicki & Brittney are great employees, super polite and my son gives them extra points for making the burritos really good so good he wants one every night. Again thank you ladies for your superb customer service."}
{"text":"I visit this Taco Bell when I get that craving and recently I had that call. The cashier this particular time was such a sweet wonderful and friendly girl. She took my order and was impeccable in the service that she delivered to me. My issue is when I received my food. I ordered a Mexican pizza, and one of the 5.00 meal boxes, and a few soft tacos. Everything was great except when I unwrapped one of the soft tacos had a fly like insect in the wrapping paper with the taco. 

I have never experienced issues such as this with Taco Bell, but I would of hoped it would of been handled better. I took the taco up to the counter and that fabulous cashier got her manager. The manager I feel when I told him my issue with the insect seemed not to believe me. I am sure this bug will not hurt me, but I did not pay extra for insects and do not care for it on my tacos at all. He remade it for me but at that time it had killed my appetite for anything TacoBell and left me feeling like I was to blame."}
{"text":"Have not visited this location since the remodel had been completed, and I am liking it. This particular Taco Bell used to be horrible but the remodel jazzed the place up some and breathed new life into it. With it getting unholy hot now this restaurant as usual, was iced cold from the air conditioning so bravo for keeping your employees and customers happy.

I ordered breakfast this morning a grilled breakfast burrito with bacon. I also ordered the potato grilled breakfast burrito too. They were both made fresh and tasted so good. The cashier that took my order was very friendly and welcoming. I was so impressed with the redo of the restaurant it makes it look so modern and beautiful. Even the bathroom the ladies got a do over. Well done Taco Bell for creating a whole new experience for your customers"}
{"text":"Needed a snack and stopped here for Mexican pizzas for me and the kiddos. The customer  service at this Taco Bell is exceptionally good. It is nice too see and rare for the Bells visited recently. I was so surprised as well at how clean the store was and the bathrooms. The speed of the service was great too and well beyond par."}
{"text":"Went in today because after the hockey game needed some fuel for yelling and such at the Golden Knights. Ordered and was a little disturbed that I would receive service like what was in the reviews, but it was great. The cashier that took my order was Susan and she even sold me on a drink with free refills for 99 cents . Great up sell the Mt Dew helped my throat from screaming and revived the twins energy. Had great experience and drive thru people seemed to move forward so if you come to this location at night go inside and not through the drive thru. Or bring a glass to have some wine to calm you for the 30-40 minute wait if you brave the drive thru......"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Taco Bell's breakfast, it's a secret passion. I ordered the egg grilled burrito with hash brown and an extra hash brown on the side. It was so delectable and nice and fresh. The staff was at the counter when I came in and believe it or not this restaurant has more foot traffic this morning inside than in the drive thru. In fact there has been no drive thru cars since we were here. 

My twins are with me and wanted regular tacos lucky for them the whole order is available. They were so good I had to have a bite . They even have gotten classy here by asking ones name to call out the order. They even brought our food and other patrons orders to them. Bravo For the highly specialized service"}
{"text":"Visited this Taco Bell since it happened to be the first place that sounded good for a spot of lunch for us. We went in and were greeted with ice cold air conditioning and a cashier who was very sweet. She took my order right away and with a little kick in her step, by this she had a wonderful demeanor about her. The food did take a little longer than I wanted it to but that's just fine. 

We ordered a few soft tacos with no lettuce, which were made to order. The soft tacos were fresh and filled with lots of cheese. I love the loaded potato's here too. They were not on the menu, but the cashier was able to fulfill this part of our order. And we even indulged in dessert with the cinnamon bites. They were fresh and we had to let them set, since we had to eat them first for just a bit."}
{"text":"Great place to put a Taco Bell, once in a while there breakfast is the best. Instead of the fourth meal, it's the first meal of the day. I was impressed how with all the construction going on how clean this store is. The bathrooms were clean too from the night before. 

This location is so great that we have even seen police officers at this location. An individual can eat and not worry about anything happening, or if chaos does come knocking then the boys in blue are their to protect and serve. The food was nice and hot and ordered just the way ordered it. Thank you Taco Bell for making my morning less stressful and more yummy. They even had great attitudes for the morning which makes the day so much happier."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just get a craving for Taco Bell and guess what I was so glad that there was one around to fulfill that need. I placed my order as usual at the front counter and the clerk was very polite and knew his job. He seemed to be fulfilling multiple positions and met his goal too with a smile. He took orders at the front counter and then excused himself to the drive thru to take care of that customer. With the precision that he handled the front counter and the drive thru they should give him a raise or promote him.

Bravo to the cooks since they made my Mexican pizza to order and looked like it should, appetizing. I was so glad to be a customer at this Taco Bell today and will be again when the itch comes around."}
{"text":"I work at the epic thrift across the street. I always eat at this Taco Bell but usually go through the drive through. I had to get food for all my coworkers so I decided to go inside. Unfortunately, I am so bad with name but the blond cashier and the older gentleman who I believe was the manager were the just so pleasant!  They gave me a good laugh and really helped me out. I had to carry a lot of stuff so one of the cooks out everything into one bag for me and the manager opened up the door. These little things really make a difference for me! I will be back and make it a point to come in instead of go through the drive though! Thanks from the epic team :)"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is awful! My boyfriend and I both got sick ordering from there around 6:30 pm last night Monday 10/17 ! Burrito Supreme looked like wet vomit because it only had beans and meat, but sadly we were hungry, The Veggie bowl was skimpily packed, and my bean burrito was barely warm. They obviously don't give a sh** I just spent the night cleaning up his vomit, and I have been sick all day today . Do NOT go here . Try a different Taco Bell. Maybe the one on Nellis but this one is a RISK! #foodpoisoning  #negativestars #healthdepartment"}
{"text":"really disappointed after going here on 9/30. ordered a am crunch wrap meal. half way to Madison, i took a bite of it and it was cold. not that big of a deal but got to the hashbrown was rock hard. like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours. then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager. pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that. then she proceeds to tell me that the person preparing it may have not noticed it. doing some food prep for my job, i called bs on her. 

in the end, would not recommend the taco bell."}
{"text":"Wish I had read these reviews before I walked in. This is slow food, not fast food. The place is clean which is a plus. The tacos came without any tomatos or sour cream ( we explicitly mentioned we wanted those). Oh well!"}
{"text":"I feel badly writing this review, like it's in response to the previous reviewer.  In a way it is, but I was truly sitting at this Taco Bell less than a week ago, thinking, \"I've reviewed Dunkin Donuts and McDonald's on Yelp... maybe it wouldn't be too weird if I reviewed this T Bell.\"

Maybe it's because I'm a regular here, but this is consistently the best Taco Bell in greater Cleveland, and I get to a lot of them.  The worst, by the way, is at Richmond (260th) & Euclid.  I won't go back there.  They're woefully understaffed at lunch.

At the South Euclid T Bell, though, you are always greeted by a live voice at the drive through, asking you how you're doing.  If you reply that you're doing well, they say that they're glad you're doing well.  If you ask them how they're doing, they say they're doing great now that you're there.  It's quaint.  They're very friendly, even if they're forced into it by the owner or manager.

And, in 7 years and probably, oh, no fewer than 100 visits, they've made ONE mistake.  They forgot the cheese that glues the two layers of a cheesy gordita crunch together once.  No kidding, that's it.  And the 100 visit mark is probably my pride talking.  It's probably closer to 200.

They also recently remodeled, so they're now in the \"warm tones\" decor, vs. the old style purple and green motif.  Always clean.

It's a Taco Bell, so I don't doubt that people before me have had 1 and 2 star experiences. But, I make a run for this particular border at least once a month, and sometimes more than once a week, and have since June, 2003.  The people are always way more friendly than what you'd expect out of a T Bell, the food is always hot, fresh (well... relatively speaking), and tasty, and the orders are (by my math) 99% or more accurate.

Viva La Taco Bell del Euclid Sur"}
{"text":"The food was great.  The young man that served us was great also.   I was in there two days ago.   My complaint is with the manager that was on duty that day.  Her name was Maria or Latina.  Anyways there was a very stuck up rude customer that was upset that she was told the senior age was 60 and she was only 55.  This was over a senior drink.   She was being pure evil to the young man at the counter and would not stop.   He was being very polite back.   After about 5 minutes of her just bullying the employee the manager Maria or Tina or Latina whatever her name was came out and listened to the lady.  At first I thought she would calm her down and say I know I am sorry you feel that way I will handle it.  Here's a free drink or something.  But no instead she brought the young man out and insisted that he apologize to this ignorant lady.  The lady was making fun of how he was acting and everything. The manager actually was agreeing with her which was so wrong.  I finally stood up because it was so humiliating for this young man and the manager was handling it horrible.  She was belittling her own employee who did nothing wrong.   The restaurant was full of people.  So my complaint is that manager should be addressed with her treatment of her employee.  No human should of ever been treated that way in front of a customer.  I finally walked up and said something and the stupid mean lady finally left and told the manager she was horrible for embarrassing the employee she walked off of course.  I felt so bad for the employ.   He was bullied by the manager and the employee."}
{"text":"Love Taco bell. Not much more to say. Great food, great service, and management is very nice. Anyone and everyone should go here(and they have some vegiterian options like bean burritos and cheese quesadillas.)"}
{"text":"Had a very cool experience at Taco Bell drive-thru. The food was good, fast service, and friendly drive-thru staff."}
{"text":"All Taco Bells taste great and are the perfect snack but this location also provides great customer service and fast drive thru lines. You can't ask for much more at a fast food chain where the food tastes the same wherever you go. This one has a unique, old style look to it and only has a drive thru or walk up and eat outside option. Nice :-)"}
{"text":"This is a Five Star Taco Bell. 
Good service, friendly employees, clean restaurant and clean bathrooms. 
Most food will be the same at every Taco Bell but the service here makes it better."}
{"text":"Clean building and friendly staff. Food is Taco Bell quality. Not bad, not good. I would go back there if I got the munchies for a Taco Bell chicken burrito again :)"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place during construction.  What a mess.  The drive through is open, but it's really slow.   The food is just not that good.  It just tastes bad.  I ordered a crunchwrap \"supreme\". Somehow I made it through 3/4 of it and suddenly got a bite of the \"cheezzzey\" sauce combined with the \"meat-like\" substance and it reminded me that horrible taste in your mouth right after you get stomach flu.  Now I know it's not of course, but I could not seem to finish it once that thought entered my brain.  All I am saying is it just didn't have a good flavor.  I ended up throwing it away.  Oh well.  It was under $4 so whatever.  2 stars is generous."}
{"text":"Every single time they screw up my order. This is my first one star review and it sucks that I am giving it to The Bell(one of my VERY guilty pleasures) There are only 5 components on a taco supreme (6 if you count the shell) yet they consistently forget one. I have yet to go to this location and have my order 100% correct. There is always something wrong the last time I got someone Else's order entirely which was cool because it was 3 times what I ordered. By the time I got home with some other poor schmucks food I was starving there was no way I was going back. I called to speak to a manager they put me on hold for about 6 minutes, that day 6 min was my limit for waiting on the line. I would imagine listing their failings and my discontent would only fall on the deaf ears of an overworked underpaid manager. Please keep in mind I am only reviewing this store and not The Bell as a whole."}
{"text":"I don't go to Taco Bell often, mainly because I prefer more authentic tacos. This Taco Bell is very close to my house though, so I will rarely go through the drive-through for a quick snack. 

The last time I did so, Taco Bell must have been shorthanded. When it was my turn to order, the employee asked me to wait a moment. And then a few minutes later, she apologized for the wait but asked me to wait again, as she was taking orders for both the drive-through and customers that were inside. 

When it was my turn, MAYBE 5 minutes had passed... It was certainly not a long enough period of time for me to get impatient or upset. Regardless, the employee was very apologetic, and offered me a free beverage to make up for the wait. I wasn't even bothered by the wait, but I was impressed with the customer service. 

I wish more fast food employees offered such service."}
{"text":"Worst wait times ever!!! Doesn't matter what time you go, lunch, dinner whatever! If you wanna waste time and chill in your car in the drive thru for 15-20 mins, this is the right place for you. Staff is always changing. There's always some incompetent youngster in the window, that is horrible at counting cash given... someone needs to revamp the staff here ASAP! Almost every time I come to this location, there's always one or two missing items from my order."}
{"text":"Good food but the wait in the drive thru is always more than 5 minutes - sometimes 10 or 15, no joke."}
{"text":"I would avoid this location. We got the hard tacos and bean burritos. Everyone that ate the hard tocos got really sick  But those who only ate the bean burritos were ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Bell. The service is amazing!!!!! Everyone is so nice and sweet. I actually applied to work at this location because it's so amazing! 
Jeff is the best!"}
{"text":"What a shitty ass Taco Bell lol. I've ordered a power bowl burrito  ahead of time, so that I can go pick it up on my lunch break, and for some reason they can't get simple orders right. If I ordered something to pick up 30 minutes ahead of time, why is my order still wrong?! This is like the 3rd time in a row they've fucked up a basic burrito so this location sucks and I'm done"}
{"text":"Thank you for getting every single item I ordered incorrect. I will not be returning to this location. Employee was rude, clearly doesn't listen, and had to be reminded to give me the drink I ordered. I don't expect a lot when it comes to fast food, but goddamn."}
{"text":"Great location right on my way to work. I'm usually a Del Taco person, but what Taco Bell misses in flavor (IMO), this location makes up for in its people. Even though I'm only in about once a week, if that, the staff know me by name and are very friendly. One cashier in particular is definitely fond of my hair ;^) Between the employees, the convenient location, and the fact that I can order ahead with an app, there will definitely be more Taco Bell in my future."}
{"text":"Must check bag to make sure your order is correct. Tacos are wrapped sloppily when order is large. Beverage machine needs to be checked and cleaned."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is fast, efficient and friendly. Not to mention consistent with their food prep. and quality. Inside is clean and outside doesn't have over flowing trashcans.  All these points seems to wildly vary from TB to TB, I'm giving them 5 stars with is something I general don't do with fast food places."}
{"text":"Okay, I do understand this is a fast food place, but I do believe if you serve people, you still need to be professional and treat people right. Even though I came here several times while I lived in Vegas, I'm not a fan. I've experienced much better at other locations. If it wasn't that this spot was 2 blocks from where I lived, I probably wouldn't have ever come. 

First off, this place never seems cleaned, even when I came first thing when they opened up. Tables and chairs almost always still had sticky stuff on them. Floors at times still looked as though the person that closed up the night before, didn't even bother to sweep up. 

Depending on day and time of day, you may get someone that is nice and takes your order quickly or you may get someone that just seems so irritated that you are wanting to order from them and then take forever to make your food. If you're going to base your opinion on coming here off the staff, don't even bother. Same with the drive-thru. I've had people take my order, but they were also talking with the other workers while taking my order. Not very professional. 

As far as the food is concerned, it was the typical Taco bell quality food. Little to no meat in the burritos or tacos. Sometimes the food didn't even seem warm or fresh. When I ask for extra of something, they always forgot to put it in my burritos. Needless to say, I never went back to ask for it, as it was just a hassle to get what I had. 

Most of the time the napkins were out and I had to ask for some. Same with the hot sauces. They only put out a few at a time, so every person has to go and ask for more. Need to make sure stuff like that is kept stocked."}
{"text":"Location: 
Conveniently located right off the I-17 and W Thunderbird, this is an easy location to get to, but can also be hard to maneuver in and out of during rush hours. 

Food:
Food is your typical Taco Bell food. I normally get my usuals and don't try new stuff, but on occasions I have tried new items and have loved it. One thing about this location that I've noticed is that their portions seem smaller then other spots and if you come after about 3, a lot of their food seem dry. But overall, it's a good place to come to for a quick bite.

Customer service:
The staff here are really nice and helpful. They'll accommodate you with special orders when you want/need them. They repeat your order before you pay to make sure that they have it correct. And food is always made quickly. 

Inside of restaurant:
Most of the times that I've been here, tables have been cleaned and floors have been swept of all food and trash. Drink station is usually filled and cleaned as well. Hot sauces, utensils and napkins are always filled. No complaints for the cleanliness of this place. 

Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"This place is my late night after work craving. The late shift folks rock and the managers are always accommodating. When they're ever out of something, I know I can come back next time and get it comped. They're fun to talk to while waiting for food too!

Update: Steven is always amusing and Caleb helped me out tonight. Holy moly thank you for making it so much fun to order food! You guys do a great job and I always look forward to stopping by! 8/25 PM"}
{"text":"Friendly staff there was a long line and the guy in front of me must've ordered 50 items when I got to the cashier he said he was sorry five times I kept saying buddy it's not your fault he kept saying sorry so I thought I said leave a five-star yelp because you showed like he really cared my receipt says it was daQuan.

{"text":"Service was kind of slow today, but I am going to have a great lunch anyway. Asked the cashier to have the food person change their gloves because I am allergic to tomatoes, of course they had an attitude about it, as usual."}
{"text":"Breakfast is supposed to be a fast experience especially on a week day. It took one curmudgeonly lady to get our order, have an attitude, and then 10 minutes later, not 5, 10 minutes later we get our food. Ridiculous morning service. That is why there was a line around chick-fil-a's building and no one at Taco Bell. Disappointed."}
{"text":"They forgot the steak in my xxl STEAK burrito. HOW? Just.. how? We come here quite a lot and it's a hit and miss, but seriously? How do you forget the steak in a steak burrito.."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese quesadilla and it smelled like  bacon and had lettuce on it from the other order that someone ordered, Which some how went in my food. I complained to the lady and then she gave me another one. when I got the other cheese quesadilla that she made, it had a piece of tomatoes on it."}
{"text":"Very nice employees, they were very good about vegetarian alternatives. The line is always long,  but, they get you through pretty quick."}
{"text":"Ha! Just waited 20 mins for 3 burritos. Employees are always pleasant if not resigned. Poor things. Seriously, come order a taco and see how long it takes. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Came here at 12Am. My self and the TWO cars in front of us were not able to order. No one responded to the 3 of us in the drivethrough so we all left. We also honked. You need to tell your very stupid and immature, terrible staff to pay attention."}
{"text":"Mold on the tortilla                                                                                                                                      Make sure to check your food for rot."}
{"text":"Taco Bell. Cheap, Tasty, and Vegetarian Options. All major pluses.

Unfortunately, this location is really not up to par with most other Taco Bells. Most concerning would be the issue of Order Accuracy. Now, I realize mistake do happen, but they should not be happening ALL THE TIME. This location must quickly revamp it's procedures so that they can fix this. One need only look at reviews, or listen to word of mouth, to know that this location is notorious for giving people the wrong orders, charging them incorrectly, ect..

Also, please take a look at your shift managers, and frankly, your leadership in general. When asked probing questions about allergy and dietary restrictions procedures, some managers fared better than others, although most did not appear to be well-versed on this issue. All seemed inconvenienced. In general, the managers just need to be held to a high standard, and it starts at the top with the General Manager. This means knowing how to respond to allergy concerns, greeting customers within moments of entering the store, and apologizing when things don't go as they should.

To sum it all up, it is more than clear this Taco Bell needs a revamp campaign soon, if they wish to remain competitive."}
{"text":"If I could give this store zero stars I would. When I received my food three out of four items, two of them were cold, and the other had onions when I asked for them to not put it on. When my boyfriend ordered we could hear them talking back and fourth asking what was in a cheesy potato burrito. Might I add there was no apologizing for ANYTHING at all ever. When we came back to tell them the mistakes the chef in the back kept \"saying how are they cold\" over and over. The point is THEY'RE COLD!!! 
And to wrap the whole situation up they put our new food in the bag with the old food still in it!!!!! I have never had a worse experience in my life."}
{"text":"I like coming here on lunch because it's close to my job. Unfortunately the two times I've delt with the female manager because of an incorrect order she was unpleasant and seemed irritated that I was asking for my order to be simply corrected."}
{"text":"The service here sucks. Came in to make a quick switch of the mini quesadilla with beef that I was given when I had asked for only cheese. First thing the employee says is \"I remember this one.\" She was rude and made an issue of it complaining that I should of double checked the screen before proceeding to the window... I did and you must of misheard - b*tch."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Taco Bell! Everyone here is always happy, friendly and clean. I think this will be my only Taco Bell location from now on. Fast, friendly and clean!!"}
{"text":"The food tastes just like every other taco bell. Facility is average clean. Employees above average. They even give you a mint and wetnap if you go through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Awesome Taco Bell.  Easy parking, clean, and great seating area.  Reason I'm writing this review because the food was properly made.  Food came out looking like the pictures for once...."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, but slow service in dining room. Why do they have a high chair but not a changing table in the restrooms? Frustrating. Not just this location; no Taco Bells have baby changing tables in restrooms. In this day and age. Handicap accessible, but poor facilities for families with young children."}
{"text":"Bunch of punk kids talking smack about the older gentleman that works here. 

You know how to tell when your food is going to be good? When a guy like that is working there, that's how! 

I'm sorry your credit card scam didn't work, but this is probably the best Taco Bell location in North Phoenix / Scottsdale bar none."}
{"text":"I never review franchises unless the are bad. This taco bell is terrible. If I want taco bell I go further and more out of the way to get it. Service is terrible, they are always messing up an order and the drive through is always backed up. Several different people have worked here and they continue to be rude, and could care less about their work ethic. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is good sometimes its not I dont know to each is own. Service is slow sometime could do better. Honestly"}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell in the world. I can only assume they're butchering the dog on a per order basis which would also make this the freshest Taco Bell in the world. That's what makes the decision whether to go or not so difficult."}
{"text":"How can there be no reviews for this location? Every time I eat here (1-2 times a week working grave shift), the food is always fresh. The employees are very nice in the drive through, and say more than just the usual \"Hi how are you\". I have not once received bad food or bad service from this location. Tonight, I went through the drive through and the employee was talking to me about funny customers, and to not worry about ordering late, or even right before they close due to the grill taking so long to cool down before they can clean it. How cool is that? Someone that actually takes care of customers. I know they do not get paid a lot working there, but wow they sure act like they love their job. The girl who handed me my food let me know that she made sure to put napkins in the bag, along with a spork. Not only did she make sure it was in there, but she called it by the right name as well. I would give her 5 starts alone just for that awesomeness.

Some Taco Bell locations can be hit or miss due to the quality of their food, but this location is great. Don't pass up this one."}
{"text":"So I stopped in at this location about 8:05 PM as stamped on my receipt. Drive thru was backed up a little so I went inside. Simple order for the family everything totaling  just over $22.00 I really should have left but.. I didn't receive my order until 8:35 PM dead serious. I mentioned something to the manager she told me they were just short handed. And walked away. Absolutely the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. Rude customer service Dirty nasty lobby trash cans full no napkins drink area was nasty floor looked like it has not been moped in days. Do NOT waist your time and go to this location you'll be  extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell drive thru is rediclious at night. Waiting 15 plus minutes to get to the speaker and another 5 minutes to get your food is crazy! You get stuck in the line and can't to anywhere and then I'm missing a taco!!! Not the first the first time I have had this experience but it will be the last time. A manager or store owner needs to fix this. How long does it take to make tacos or burritos with pre-made ingredients in a system where the process is standardized for efficiency? Never fast food restaurant with such poor service."}
{"text":"This is unfortunately the worst Taco bell location I've experienced in my vast experience of taco bells.  Not just one visit, but many visits with long drive through wait times. I'm talking 25 minutes on one visit, 10-15 minutes for many more, and many orders with food made incorrectly.   This place is right by my house so I keep trying them to see if they've improved and it hasn't happened yet...I'll post positively if it does because I love MOST taco bell's!"}
{"text":"The people at this Taco Bell are always so nice and helpful! It's refreshing to be greeted by such positive people. I've never had an issue with the food I've ordered and the dining room is always clean. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive through in all of the fast food land. I am literally writing this as I'm waiting in line. One would think based on the wait times that there is a fine cuisine being prepared with items delivered fresh from Mexico. My damn people, aren't you just stuffing lettuce and cheese in a shell?  Why does this drive through take so long? I hate that there isn't many other options in the area. If you are in a hurry or don't have 20 min to blow in line then avoid this place like the plaque."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell I've ever been to.  Very friendly staff, and they always go the extra mile to make sure you have a good experience."}
{"text":"I have no idea what is going on at this Taco Bell, but it is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to with regard to management. The inside is really cute, I like the decor and layout for what must be the smallest free-standing store that Taco Bell produces. However, behind the counter things are a mess.
I really enjoy using the Taco Bell app. You can customize your order and get exactly what you want. I use it quite a bit and Champaign-urbana. It allows me to make my meals there healthier. I have come to the conclusion that I can flat-out not use the app at the Tuscola location. I have tried 4 times and have yet to have an order where my customized order can be completed. This is not because they are mentally incapable of processing a mobile order. It is because they are out of basic supplies and ingredients that must be stocked in order to properly operate a Taco Bell restaurant. One time, they did not have  chips. CHIPS! There are many nacho items on the menu. As a manager, how can you let your location run out of chips? That would be like McDonald's running out of french fries. 
Another time they didn't have large cups. The person at the window did not know what to do. They could have offered me two small drinks, they could have offered me a refund, they could have offered me something in replacement. They offered nothing - not even an apology. They just stood there dumbfounded,  and did not know what to do.
I don't know how this location is going to make it. I hope that they turn things around."}
{"text":"I freaking love Taco Bell. 

Every time a cheesy gordita crunch is in my presence, I bust out the kleenex and vaseline.

THANK GOD FOR TACO BELL!"}
{"text":"Hottest, tastiest, most bestest Taco Bell I've EVER been to!  Well done guys!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I watched my bag of food drop on the floor, my taco has barely anything in it & it's soggy and cracked. Awesome"}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest fast food I've ever received. I only go to this one because its the closest to my apartment but for real man, slow slow slow. I've been stuck in the drive thru for for about 15 min on multiple occasions. Going inside is even slower, had to wait 30min. Not sure if they are understaffed or training but it's like this every time we go."}
{"text":"I am very dissapointed with the service I received at this Taco Bell, the lady who was at the drive through window 1. took forever to get or order. 2. instead of making conversation, she was flirting with my husband, she asked him what he was doing this weekend & what kind of stuff he does infront of me, she also showed him a tattoo she got which is located in her rib cage & we saw her under garment & her skin as well. I don't think that is appropriate because she didn't just show him her skin but she also touched our food with the hands that revealed her back. I am so mad she as well gave us the wrong order & a Mexican old lady had to correct her who was also working with her & as she rolled her eyes when the Mexican lady corrected her, she forgot our sauces, I will never attend this Taco Bell again in life & if I do I will make sure everyone uses safety procedures in handling food, it's really gross to say that she not only flirted with my husband, but also didn't handle our food correctly so it was thrown away by us. I would love to speak to a manager about my experience because I really hope this never happens to anyone else."}
{"text":"It's fast food, how much can we say. Well turns out a lot. I'm not expecting to get authentic Mexican cuisine but at least give me hot food. Every time I go to Taco Bell the tacos are always cold. And what's with paying almost $20 for 10 tacos? They're cheap tacos can't be that expensive as far as markups concerned. It's a shame because it seems like no one gives a crap. Maybe if they gave the employees more incentive they would be more motivated to serve quality food. I'm not sure what they would have to do but whatever it is heat my darn food up at the very least."}
{"text":"Been here countless times seeing how they are the ONLY taco bell in the area. Still EVERY TIME they forget at least 2 things that I ordered. Just a reminder to completely check your bag before leaving this taco bell. I'm not sure how their memory can be that bad but at least it's consistent..."}
{"text":"My mainstay of food has changed drastically within the last month or two my food intake has relied mainly on take out of my favorites and fast food.  If I do review fast food it is not the food I am reviewing because there is a standard of quality that must be maintained or the standard of the fast food chain will be compromised however that changes within the management of each chain.  

Whew with that said, The quality of every meal I get here is excellent as far as fast food goes.  However the quality of customer service goes above and beyond.  They are super nice in the speaker always polite and the order is also correct as well as the side/sauces!  I am always happy and happy to be happy in the speaker and at the window to the employees because they are so nice!

I will continue to eat here because I have never had a problem and the employees are so extremely NICE whats up?! Thank you..."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell. Automatic 2 stars. 

This location gets an extra star because they make the best bean burritos. They always have the right sauce to bean ratio (never dry- you know what I'm talking about), and they never get my order wrong when I order it without onions. Also, why are the onions even an option? I'm not anti-onion, but I am in this one isolated case, their presence confuses me a lot...

Also, yeah, sometimes drive-throughs are slow. This is not a reason to get mad. You just need to accept what the Universe gives you and wait patiently for your chalupa and crunchwrap supreme, amirite?"}
{"text":"WOW! Not only is this location nice and fast service but the customer service is AMAZING! There is a lady there named Sabrina that is SOOOO delightful! From the moment she greeted me at the drive through she was so darn pleasant, I couldn't help but to keep a smile on my face the entire time I was ordering my food. When I left there it literally made my day because she was so joyful and happy! Definitely left a great impression on business and this location specifically! :)"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is awful. We ordered a chalupa combo and a chicken quesadilla combo. I ordered extra sauce for my quesadilla and heard the drive through rep ask the other employees for a sauce but when I opened the bag no sauce was inside. I took one bite into my taco and surprisingly it was very crunchy...guess why: there was no meat!! Literally it was full of lettuce and cheese like come on isn't meat the main substance of the taco beside the shell?! Im very disappointed in the lack of effort on the very early morning of April 28th and am sad I won't be attending the same location for my next quesadilla combo. If I could give less than one star I would...you're lucky you got one star out of me!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by after work for some dinner (a 2am dinner) and was treated to the BEST service I've ever received in the 20 years I've been dining out.  Jessica was an absolute delight- super sweet and polite.  Really made may day after a long night at work.  Thanks Jessica!!!!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru recently and ordered what I usually order. Everything tasted normal, but I got a pretty severe stomachache later. The only thing I can say is that while I won't quit Taco Bell as a whole, I won't be going as often. I think that sometimes they don't thoroughly cook the potatoes and meat."}
{"text":"Inside the restaurant it's very dirty. Tea containers were empty, all of the tables were dirty, and the drink bar had water spilled all over it."}
{"text":"If you're itching for cheap, down-n-dirty quick eats that taste nothing like authentic Mexican fare, this is your stop!

Taco Bell is the bomb - even back in the 80s! I mean, who can resist those crunchy tacos? So delish. 

It is especially good after a wild night out. I can honestly say that if you eat Taco Bell when you're intoxicated and you go to bed, you'll feel pretty damn good in the AM. It makes me laugh when I find shredded cheese and tomato bits on my coffee table in the morning from my 2:30am feeding frenzy. Silly wabbit!"}
{"text":"After standing at the front counter for more then thirty minutes I begged for my order to be made and I was ignored this is a very poor establishment"}
{"text":"Brand new, this TB opened last week and still has the clean. I think they chose the location well because the place has been packed every time I have driven by. Still sparkly and un-vandalized on the inside and the staff hasn't learned how to ignore customers or to let the sauces get unstocked. We'll see how they do in a year."}
{"text":"New new new Taco Bell on South Tryon a little past the intersection with Steele Creek. It's a stand-alone store with the usual new features inside including soda fountain and \"modern\" menu. Folks seemed nice enough and my 7-layer burrito was wrapped as it should be. The sauce and napkin area was stocked and clean. No complaints, this TB is A-OK."}
{"text":"Taco Bell and I go way back to the days of my youth.  I still like to stop by and order a 7-Burrito every now and again.  Just as I did on Saturday afternoon.  I also like the cheap chickcen burrito they have.  It is another go to for me.  But what do you do when the Taco Bell nearest to you is hit and miss on a regular basis?  I continue going expecting frustration and being pleasently surprised when everything runs smoothly.

More often than not my frustration arises from the people infront of me in the drive-thru.  They take so damn long to order sometimes.  Other times, like on Saturday, the delays seem more of the fault of the people behind the counter.  I saw a bag of food passed back and forth between the window and the truck ahead two or three times.  Apparently they could not get the order right inside.  When I got up to the window I waited though I could clearly see my food sitting there as three employees were discussing another issue.  They knew I was there and even took my money.  I was getting a little irritated and may or may not have cussed a bit when I drove off.  Yet on a previous visit I was very surprised at the service I received.  I was greeted warmly when I pulled up the the order box.  I got my food quickly.  It was fresh and hot.  I was even given a free Vanilla Dr. Pepper slushie thing as I seemed \"to be in a good mood.\"  If I wasn't before I certainly was afterwards.  That was kind of cool.

With any relationship there are bound to be ups and downs.  And so goes mine with Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Writing a review for a fast food restaurant seems odd but the service at this location is really good and I think they deserve a shout out. I live near this location and I stop by when I'm in need of a quick dinner on the run. My order has always been accurate and the service has always been super friendly. The management at this Taco Bell is doing something right because the associates always seem motivated and happy. The Doritos's taco's are super tasty! Good job Taco Bell on Rural Rd!"}
{"text":"I got here quite a few times each week on my way to work, its never super busy.  My order is always right and it some of the best drive thru customer service I have ever had.  Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"yummy !!

Great customer service (especially from the guy that took my order in the drive thru)

And vegetarian options !!!! yay !!!

fast, good, hot food !!! 

will go back"}
{"text":"It's pretty much like any other Taco Bell ... new employee every day and poor management. Make sure you check your bag before you drive away because I guarantee you they forgot something."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've shown up this Taco Bell hours before their posted closing time to find them closed early. It is now 10pm and everything online and on the doors says they close at midnight. Either update your hours or stay open until you say you close. Pretty simple business model, I'd say."}
{"text":"I am done with Taco Bell for Good. They changed the chicken quality to this nasty shredded chicken and the so called premium chicken is the normal chicken that was used before. - I just tossed half my order. It tasted horrible."}
{"text":"\"Yo Quiero Taco Bell!\" 

For a Taco Bell this is one of the better locations. The food is consistent and they've never forgotten anything through the drive through. (Sucks big time when that happens) We've never dined in so I can't say how the inside looks or how clean it is. For me that's usually the first thing I want to know. 

One of the best things they added was the salsa verde. My son is always upset because he wants to use hot sauce like mom and dad, but it was too spicy for him. Now he use about 2 packets per taco. \"Don't forget my green sauce mom.\" Lol

Honestly there's not much more to say about a fast food joint. We usually frequent this establishment on a night we need something easy, fast and close."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell award. I go thru the drivethru and they didn't have half of what I wanted to order. I change my order and then I get to find find they didn't give me most of my order... Plus the food was crazy cold. Clearly not made when we ordered it."}
{"text":"More recently the food seems to be taking a tumble. The last two times I've gotten a quesadilla there it's been barely cooked. The cheese was unmelted and the tortilla not really crisp in any way. Bummer"}
{"text":"I know I know its fast food, but this place isn't or at least the day I went. Took at least 10-15 minutes to get my food I'm not joking. Try something else in the area like PoBoy's right across the street."}
{"text":"By far the worst Taco Bell anywhere. Service is terrible, slow, rude. never again. Since they are on every other corner I won't be going back to this one. I think Chantell R needs training.."}
{"text":"Ok simple order......soft shell taco, instead James E. gives me hard shell.  WTH! And they want a raise? F### that!"}
{"text":"What's there to say about Taco Bell that hasn't already been said about wet socks. It really isn't an issue until about minute three when it's highly advised to locate the nearest restroom to change before any real damage occurs. I'm quite puzzled as to where people are getting this holier than thou judgement on a fast food chain. \"The lady was rude...\" Of course she was, she's probably been dealing with people in Lego filled mini vans who have chosen to haul around Satan's offspring in the back seat screaming out, \"why can't we wear our batman shirts everyday.\" Lets be honest with ourselves here, gracefully accept your #6 taco surprise with a side of pepto bismol and hope it has enough mercy on your soul to allow you to make it home with the same pair of underwear you started with. Three stars for being a reliable day care for the worst people every state has to offer."}
{"text":"I must say that I have lived close to this Taco Bell for two years now and do not have one complaint of the service or food received when visiting this location. The employees at he driver thru are always very polite and accommodating. It is nice to go to a fast food restaurant that is consistent with its customer service. I definitely recommend that this Taco Bell is  up to par!"}
{"text":"The food tastes like any Taco Bell and I've never gotten an incorrect order so I say it's a nice place to visit."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave the drive-thru or risk discovering only 75% of your order filled by the time you get home."}
{"text":"I disagree, this Taco Bell is NOT the best. They FOOL you into THINKING it's the best because they repeat your order back to you in the drive-thru, in the order that  you ordered the items, and then you feel confident that they got it right, then you pull up to the window and they repeat it to you AGAIN, giving you MORE false confidence, and then you check the bag and everything LOOKS right, then you drive all the way home and discover you've got the wrong items, things you didn't order, wrapped to label what you asked for. 
Granted, at the end of the day, it's all the Bell and pretty much the same. So you eat it anyway. But you still harbor resentment for the trickery."}
{"text":"This particular Taco Bell has never forgotten to complete my order, and has always taken \"special requests\" easily.

Not like some of the others..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing a review for a fast food chain location, but alas, here we are. 

Fast food is meant to be systematic, quick, repeatable, and cheap. This location consistently has long wait times, and I have yet to get an order without errors. Always order a soft taco, always get a hard one. Thought this was simple enough, but I guess not. Waited for 25 minutes in the drive thru tonight. Definitely going elsewhere next time I'm in the mood for GI distress."}
{"text":"The store was not clean today, dirty tables..I will admit it was fast service msybe 5 minutes"}
{"text":"Straight ghetto filthy place this person was sitting at a table with no food and dirty cleats an socks on the table! As I was ordering the person preparing the food was picking at it and eating the food while she worked gross!! I know it happens but come on then she proceeded to keep working and for every three she packaged !  I let the \"Shift Leader\" know -nothing changed! Filthy place with low standards go somewhere else yelpers!"}
{"text":"I've come to this location several times and never had any problems. They are always fast and have my order right. Even during their happy hour.

Just took a bite of one of my tacos and got a mouth full of clear, ice cold lettuce. It's one thing for cold lettuce, but frozen lettuce? Really Taco Bell?! I had to take a star back for that one."}
{"text":"So I went here late last night (midnight-ish) to grab a quick meal before I headed home. Usually around this hour, I'm in and out of the drive thru in about 5 minutes.

I waited 20 minutes (20 full minutes!) in the drive thru. Keep in mind, this is a Tuesday night and there were only 3 cars ahead of me. It's not like there was a line of cars around the block. 

When I FINALLY got up to the window, I received no apology, no explanation for the wait, no flustered cashier. What I got was the familiar blank stare of a fast food employee with zero fucks left to give. 

Am I shocked? No. Will I be back because I'm lazy and addicted to their bastardized version of Mexican fare?

Yes."}
{"text":"BEST....BEST....TACOBELL customer service ever!!!!! This is not my regular TACOBELL but I have been here couple times and everytime I must say EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Today though this girl name CAITYLN! Omg!! She made our evenings! She made us laugh just so FRIENDLY!! I just want to say KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!! And you guys should train other Tacobell to do the same!"}
{"text":"This is your standard Taco Bell - they didn't mess up our orders, so I don't have anything negative to say."}
{"text":"Same standard Taco Bell service - you get what you pay for as far as the food goes, but they always get our order right."}
{"text":"So after a long night at the park with the kids and my mom. We were hungry and wanted something for the way home. We stopped by and ate inside. We ordered and the manager who we could hardly hear was taking our order and we spoke up again and she got our order again. After we were waiting and while I stood there and got our order. I forgot to order a Naked Chicken Chips which I did, and as she got to making them, she didn't have no gloves on her hands and she had the nerve to scoop them out one by one and give me my order right in my face. Not pleased at this location."}
{"text":"so maria v. is so rude. i come in the walk through almost on a weekly basis, this particular time i had a short lunch break so i decided i would go through the drive through it was me and a co worker, well my co worker forgot to split the order so we unfortunately,asked for it to be split at the window, that is when we experienced the worst customer service ever, she immediately said \"you should have asked for it to be split at the when you put the order in\" she then slammed the window. after that happened i asked for her manager, when the manager came to the window she allowed apologized for this employees behavior, the strange thing is that the employee with the bad behavior was allowed to tell the manager \"hurry up and get them out of here\" so the manager gave me the food and when i went to open, can you guess, you guessed it food went everywhere bcs the disgruntled employee prepared it. and when i called back although, they said it was replaceable the deed had already been done .. you cannot unsuck my bad experinece!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is a joke. Screwed up drive-thru order, food is disgusting, hard, dry. Wont answer phone. Calling MasterCard to do a chargeback."}
{"text":"Very very rude employee  ... will never ever go to this restaurant again !!
I placed a large order over $50.00 from the Long John Silver's menu, when I got it I was missing an item, when I asked about it, the young man who prepared my order told me I was wrong ...and in a very defensive tone that I did not order two and he had made what I ordered.  I said I wasn't arguing I just want to get my order correct ... he became defensive again & told me I had only ordered one.  I asked for a manager (who told me they were just very very busy) ... I guess that excuses rudeness.  I left very unhappy.
I will be taking my business elsewhere ... the Long John Silver's at 19th Ave & Bell has a better selection & nice professional employees !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Doritos Loco Taco but got Nachos instead, oh well, it tasted great. Bathroom smelled TERRIBLE though. I gagged the whole time and held my breath til my face turned blue. It wasn't a urine smell, it was some strange heavy chemical, and no ordinary chemical. Strange..."}
{"text":"One of the better Taco Bells on the east side. Orders seem to be correct and employees are always courteous and friendly. AND, most importantly, they seem interesting in doing a good job. Helping me live with the guilty pleasure of TB."}
{"text":"They were very busy as they usually are and we had a small problem with our order and Kyle took great care of us and resolved the problem right in the spot. Very professional and great customer service . It does seem as they need more people to work the shifts when it is busy."}
{"text":"Food is the same as every other TB.  Service was really slow with only 3 staff for a busy,sunday afternoon.  After waiting about 8 mins to place the order as soon as I said \"I'll have..\" counter guy started talking to the kitchen guys girlfriend whose on my side of the counter.  Turned back to me and said \"ummm, did u want something\".  So ya.  Go if u really crave a run to the border otherwise walk to burrito boys a block north."}
{"text":"Wow. I am totally impressed. I have to agree Jeremy S on 2/2/12...this is by far the best Taco Bell that I have ever eaten at. I am not yet familiar with Vegas, so when my husband pulled up to this one, I was a little concerned. 

The food was really fresh, and they do NOT skimp in the toppings. So glad we stopped.

We really liked not having to ask for sauces, as they were nicely arranged on the counter."}
{"text":"We went through drive-thru. It's right by our house, and we were in a Taco Bell kind of mood. Marcelle was our cashier. He was super polite and courteous. Lots of toppings on our nachos and burritos. Thanks! Now we know this is a great Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Monday at nearly midnight. Now that is not our usual time to grab some fast food, as we are typically in bed. However, we had just gotten home after an 8 hour flight delay from Denver. Ugh. We were tired and cranky. 

We ordered simple crunchy taco supremes to go. The clerk at the drive through was really animated and friendly. He really made us feel welcome. We received our food quickly. Once we got home, we enjoyed some of the best tacos from Taco Bell that we have had in a long time. They did not skimp on any of the meat or toppings. This experience really made our day."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is excellent. We came in around 9am and discovered that their entire menu is available at 7am. We initially were thinking of breakfast, but we quickly fell back on our favorite 'crunchy taco supreme'. Oh and we tried their Chicken Chips with cheese sauce. Was not sure what to expect with these. They are like flat chicken tenders. Not too bad, but a little dry the longer they sat there during our meal. There was a hint of spiciness to the chicken as well. 

The Tacos were fresh, and packed full. The lobby was clean and well stocked. Definitely coming back to try their $1 breakfast menu items."}
{"text":"This place is trash  girl in the line was rude and rushed through my order, the food was wrapped all sloppy on top of it being cold! Tried to call them to complain about my experience and the phone literally rang for about 6 minutes. I'm currently on my way back there as I type!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience the morning we went. I like their Mini Skillet Bowl, and like to change out the cheese sauce for real cheddar. It's an extra 45 cents, but to me it's worth it. The pico de Gallo was really fresh, and that made it great. I recently discovered the breakfast salsa, and now it's a must for anything on the breakfast menu for me.  

Everything was fresh, the food was nicely presented and the woman who took our order was super friendly. As we left, there were two workers in the lobby sweeping and cleaning tables. Place looked great."}
{"text":"I keep trying this location, well because of location, but I swear I will NEVER eat here again!  Absolutely the worst service, cleanliness, and food is always prepared poorly.  They just don't care."}
{"text":"They need to take some lessons from Chik Fil A right next door on how to keep things moving through a drive thru at peak times. This was one of the longest waits in a drive thru I've ever had. I'm starving!!! Come on!! At least they got my order right."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. The first time they got my order wrong and I had to get out of my car walk all the way back in to have them fix it. Both times the drive-thru was extremely slow. They must be very unorganized inside. Don't expect to get fast food here."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a fast food joint. It's Taco Bell. Pretty much the only thing that one would rate a fast food joint on is the speediness of the food, the cleanliness of the business, the friendliness of the staff but if you come to a fast food joint and expect high quality food then I think that there might be something wrong with you. I stopped in here because I was on my way to an appointment and I was hungry. Just needed something quick. Ordered my food through the drive-through and asked for steak on my Chalupa. On the screen it said beef. When she asked me if everything on the screen was correct I said well, no I asked for steal. The lady seemed to be annoyed that I corrected her which is too bad for her. But I got to the window she almost threw the food out the window to me I guess she was pissed off that I had corrected her. I did a passive aggressive move and sat there in front of the window slowly going through my bag to make sure that everything was correct with my order. Then I tapped on the window and told her that I needed a fork. Yeah, she was annoyed. I sat in the parking lot to eat my food and a few minutes later I see the same lady come out and get into the car. She sat there smoking a cigarette. No offense, but I think smoking is one of the most nastiest habits out there. So it just bothered me a little bit to see that she was the one who has just been handling my food. But, yeah what do you expect? It's a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Would give 0 but can't. Sat in line for 5+ minutes and no one came to take my order. Drove past the drive thru spot and saw them all standing around in the window. How do people have jobs? 

Update:: drove through an hour before they closed- they told me they were short staffed and were closing early. There was no one in line and all they had to do was make one Taco for me. That's complete bullshit."}
{"text":"I would give 0 if possible. Slowest service at any fast food place I have ever been. Ever. So frustrating. 20 minutes in the drive Tru!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Taco Bell many times.  My order is always correct, drive thur is fast and the crunch wraps from this location are the best!! I will drive to this location just for their Crunch Wraps!! Good job Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I ordered via the drive thru, 2 of the Diamondback specials with the drinks a Large Dr.Pepper and a Large Mt.Dew/Lemonade.  And a steak quesadilla, got my order the ONLY thing wrong was one ofvthe drinks, I had ordered the Mt.Dew/Lemonade splash. What they gave me was a mist twist which didn't bother me. Until I got home to drink it and it was so bitter. It was full of carbonation but zero flavor syrup. I will go back again, but will make sure that they get the right drink order,"}
{"text":"I decided to stop at this restaurant on a whim because I was driving by and I was hungry.  This is a dual store, where they a Taco Bell as well as a Long John Silver's restaurant.  

I arrived around mid afternoon and ordered some fish and chicken.  As I waited for my food, I was told the wait would be 10 - 15 minutes for them to cook it fresh.  They did not offer to bring it out to my table so I had to stand at the counter, waiting.  The wait was approximately 20 minutes.

While the fish and chicken were fresh off the fryer and tasty, the fries and hush puppies were cold.  It's sad that the cheapest things on my plate were the least appetizing. 

The staff did not apologize for the wait, nor were they too friendly.  Unfortunately, the manager who was manning the fryers did not bother to make eye contact with me either."}
{"text":"First of all, they got my order wrong. Went back to get the correct order, which I got. When I asked for another sauce the employee or manager told me that she gave a big salsa before. I said well it isn't in there. I said I would even pay for it since it's such an issue. They got my order and giving me a salsa was a big deal. I will definitely go to the other Taco Bell I. Monroe. Definitely not this one!"}
{"text":"I won't ever come back to this Taco Bell. Service sucks and manager (old lady that looks like a man) is really rude, she needs more fast food management training. The store is really filthy and who knows what they use to prepare the food. So PLEASE, I wouldn't come here if I were you. YUCK!"}
{"text":"I live in Anthem Conventry and used to frequent this location. I never had a problem with anything until my most recent experience. While placing my order in the drive thru, with my children in the back seat, the employee taking the order was extremely rude and condescending. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but I had never had anyone in a drive thru talk to me the way she did. My children even noticed it and asked me why she was talking to us that way. When I got to the window, I cancelled my order and told the manager about how badly the interaction in the drive thru was. She defended the girl and shut the window in my face. I will not return to this location and I will encourage everyone I talk to to do the same."}
{"text":"I only come to Taco Bell for inexpensive but decent fast food.   That is exactly what I always get here.  The food is hot and fresh and my lunch came to $5.22.   The employees were very nice and even brought my meal out to my table. 

The dining room and restrooms were clean.  The posted sanitation grade is 97.5.  I feel comfortable eating here."}
{"text":"They met my expectations.  The place appeared pretty clean.  The employees were friendly enough.  My order was correct.  I discovered after I pulled away that I had a cup full of ice and unflavored carbonated water instead of the soft drink I ordered.  My burrito Supreme was good.  This place is okay."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat.  The smothered burrito is the best ever.  I haven't found anything here that hasn't been great.  I would highly recommend this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"four of us wanted seperate checks. we were told we had to go around the drive thru 4 times. mind you, there were no people here at nearly 2 in the morning. \"now hiring friendly energetic people\" but we heard someone yell no in the background at us upon asking a simple question i feel quite disrespected on a city that thrives on hospitality."}
{"text":"The employees at this location are extremely friendly. Only complaint I have is that they have some trouble keeping up with the high volume as far as cleanliness in the dining area. But all in all, we're pleased and continue to return when we're on the go."}
{"text":"It might sound crazy to write a review of Taco Bell. But the GM, James, is a crazy friendly guy who genuinely loves his job and his coworkers. Plus he gave my dog, Schuyler, a biscuit! I almost wanted to ask him out on a date. Maybe next time? (grin)"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, but for some reason they have the most squishy beans in the world. It's like... a muddy paste of beans, nothing like what the beans could have been. The shells were broken on my tacos, so I normally stick with Chalupas at this location. I'm a little ashamed just to admit to you guys that I go here. Vegetarian fast food options are limited. :("}
{"text":"I really like this location.  It is conviently located near Nellis AFB but away from the more seedy area.  I eat here about twice a month and have never had a rude staff member at either the drive thru or inside.  Clean!!  So hard to find on Craig Road.  Yes its fast food but the Cantina bowl is awesome and rocks my socks!"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... 5 stars for taco bell??? Yes!! Of course this is biased, but I've never eaten in the store, however, I've probably went through this drive thru at least 50x (Don't judgeXD) But this place is the best taco bell in Arizona. The food here is like what you see in  the commercials! It always gives you a ton of food! Bang for your buck!!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I give a one-star review, but I'm over this location. I'll start by saying that generally, I like Taco Bell. I'm not knocking them for being anything that they're not. However, I don't think I've ever left here with my order correct. 

The biggest issue is that on several occasions I have ordered vegetarian and gotten meat in my meal. I usually order a Crunch Wrap, so it's not super easy to check my order in the car before I drive away. I always look at the screen when I'm ordering, but it doesn't matter if the person taking the order punched it in correctly - the kitchen staff seems to just put in whatever they feel like. Or, for that matter, leave out whatever they want. I seem to get one of two variations on my order of \"Crunch Wrap sub beans for beef\": 
1) The wrap includes beef, or, this past time, a ton of chicken; or,
2) Beans but no nacho cheese.

Gross as it is, the nacho cheese is half the reason I crave T. Bell. I know I live in the greatest state for cheese, but there's something about that glowing orange sauce that I love. 

The drive thru line is also impossibly slow. 

I don't order a lot of food, so it's not worth the time and effort to go back and get the right thing/a refund. I'm guessing a lot of people feel the same, and that may be part of why they're so terrible."}
{"text":"Taco Bell, when they have their junk together, is actually not that bad. Unfortunately, this was just another letdown in a long string of Madison T-Bell visits. My BF and I stopped by this location in hopes of a quick and cheap lunch because I was under the weather and too tired to make anything. 

The biggest issue is that it took nearly 20 minutes to get through the drive-thru with only one car ahead of us (and no one behind). The person ahead was already in the process of ordering when we pulled up so it should have been pretty quick. For how long we sat before being able to pull up the window we figured they must have ordered for a frat house, but alas, they were handed one small bag. We still ended up sitting for several minutes after we pulled up to the window. 

Next issue was the price. I haven't been to Taco Bell in a couple of years but you used to be able to get a ridiculous amount of food for not a lot of money. Our five items ended up coming in at $18. The combination of how long we waited + how much we paid could have easily translated into a sit-down fast casual meal at many places around town. 

Lastly, my boyfriend ordered his items without lettuce and ended up with piles of it on his gordita. Not a huge deal in the grand scheme, but I go back to waiting twenty minutes with only one order ahead. You'd think with that amount of time and no slam of customers they could double-check the order before handing it out. 

I considered giving one star but they are the first TB in Madison to actually give me my item of choice without meat as requested - that alone is enough to bump up to two. 

I have fond memories of Taco Bell, but the quality of the food has declined since my last visit. The seven-layer burrito had no flavor and was assembled a little too literally - I got each ingredient individually as I ate my way down. Tortilla and sour cream, tortilla and rice, tortilla and guac - it's like they applied each item in horizontal stripes and then rolled it up. I love sour cream but it shouldn't be the highlight of the dish. 

I want to like you, Taco Bell, but I think that's probably my last visit for a long while."}
{"text":"We have been to this Taco Bell at least a dozen times over the past few months and it's the cleanest outlet I have seen. The people behind the counter have always been polite and helpful and the food has always  been hot and tasty. One time the Dr. Pepper tasted like water, but when I mentioned it, the server re-filled the machine, then brought me a super-large cup filled with soda. That was really nice of her. We love this Taco Bell! One suggestion: This store really needs a remodel, as it really feels dated, faded and old... but the quality of food and service, still outweighs that issue."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, how is this Taco Bell rated so low? I have gotten food here before and been perfectly content with the food and service. Staff is always very friendly. I usually don't write reviews for fast-food places but tonight warranted a review.

After a long night at the office, I wanted to treat myself to a Crunchwrap Supreme. It was the only thing I was craving in this world. This location closed at 1am. I BOOKED IT to Taco Bell and arrived at 12:59am. I was THAT person that has to go to a restaurant just before they close when everyone is trying to go home (I was a server before, I know the struggle haha). 

I veer into the drive thru and was pleasantly greeted through the intercom. I ordered my Crunchwrap Supreme, fresca style. The guy that served my food was so friendly and nice, asking how my night was and gave me some extra goodies they had around since it was closing time. There was no annoyance or rushedness that they were closing.

I truly appreciated the great service I had here. It was a nice end to quite a long day and damn was my Crunchwrap delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and service but how about not writing your cell number on my receipt next time Bryan Tassainer..comes off sort of creepy when all I said was \"mild please\" lol yeah I looked up the phone number on google and found it matched cashier's first name on receipt"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is strangely wonderful; after a LONG drive through nothingness, albeit beautiful nothingness, from Northern California, my friend and I were famished. It was late at night, our hotel wasn't letting us check in (rooms were in another person's name who hadn't arrived yet...@$)(&#) so we were on the hunt for good food that wasn't going to break the bank (like the night ahead of us would).

I knew that with some driving, we were bound to find a Taco Bell. It's familiar, consistent, and gets the hunger-job done.

We drove... and drove... until we finally spotted that glorious rasta-mehiko bell dangling in the Vegas dusk. YES. I swerved (er.. well, it was stand-still, jam-packed traffic) but still, I turn-signalled and shoved my way across FIVE lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic to get us to this Taco Bell.

It was so worth it. They had more sauce packets than I've ever seen, and I drowned my three chicken tacos in an ocean of fire sauce.

Funny fact: my sauce packet said \"Let's go get matching tattoos.\" I wonder if that's special copy for sin city, haha.

Too bad I was craving more at 3am (room service?).

I love you, TB! You make Vegas better."}
{"text":"Horrible. Bought 3 burritos. They are the size of my hand. It was like a spoonful of meat. Food wasn't fresh. Not worth coming back. Waste of money"}
{"text":"Scenario:
It's 10PM on a weeknight and you feel like having a Burrito. Where do you go? Taco Bell, that's where! 
This Taco Bell has been around for a very long time, I remember going to this place since I was in grade school. The restaurant itself hasn't changed very much, the interior has stayed the same since (I presume) since it opened. Regardless of the interior; where it counts it behind the counter and what's being created there. On a general scale, yes Taco Bell isn't the greatest, but for fast food it's pretty damn good. They have a decent selection of Texmex cuisine to fulfill your cravings. 
The service has been pretty good (at least in my experience). But let's be honest you're not coming here for 5* service. Other than that my only recommendation would be for this place to renovate; it's long over due."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would I came at 1:40am, 20 minutes before close the manager was outside and said they closed. Not ok"}
{"text":"The drive through usually moves pretty fast, the only issue here is the cups and lids smell like grease so every time you drink it smell like fryer oil from long John silvers."}
{"text":"Found an insect in my Chalupa. Don't eat here unless you're training for fear factor."}
{"text":"Just an amazing experience really good customer service, fast food and an awesome team."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the staff is very inattentive often messing up orders or forgetting simple things like silverware, napkins, etc."}
{"text":"Seriously the most lazy and slow place ever. All the kids here are either  baked out of their minds or on something else because they are all zombies with bloodshot eyes. The manager hangs out back all day and does nothing. They can never get an order right. The drive thru is always backed up because there is only one person on the line while everyone else is hanging out in the manager office. The owners need to get this place in check real quick."}
{"text":"You know how when you were a lil kid, you wanted to go to McDonalds and get a happy meal? Well, I rather have Taco Bell instead. Weird huh? I think that I've always been a big fan because of the cheesy goodness. My favorites are the pintos and cheese, nachos supreme and chicken soft taco. Sometimes I stray and get a Mexican pizza, but other than that I keep it simple. I've never been here for dine in, but the drive thru service is pretty quick. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went today and they messed up the order, was given an unwrapped straw by hand, and not given a receipt. Been here before and sometimes had issues sometimes have not. Not worth returning. Oh and their bean burrito isn't half as good as Filiberto's."}
{"text":"The food is good but they close the dining room way too early. More than once we have come to eat and went across the street to KFC or McDonalds because the dining room is closed. Tonight it was locked up BEFORE 9:00. Ourselves and two other families just left and ate somewhere else. I am just going to stop coming to this Taco Bell at all."}
{"text":"Great food. Quesarito is worth eating here. Never been through the drive through, but the dine in is really clean and the environment is pleasant.

The burrito wrapped in the quesadilla is the best here. They do not skimp. Lots of cheese and the center of the burrito has plenty of nacho cheese sauce. Ate breakfast dollar menus, but not worth it. Mostly tortilla not much bacon or eggs.

Best dollar menu selection is on Taco Bell at Craig Rd."}
{"text":"Cheesy beef Fritos burrito from the dollar menu here is the best. Most Fritos and nacho cheese from this food chain.

Chalupa don't have much ground beef mostly lettuce. If you ask the Smothered burritos are still available. Dine in. Drive through sometimes is a bit slow"}
{"text":"Welp...came here for dinner tonight to try out this oh so famous Chickstar that has been popping up on commercials. It definitely wasn't that great and looks much better on TV. There are three flavors...mango bbq, Chipotle & bacon ranch. They were out of the flavor I wanted mango bbq of course. Went with the Chipotle and there really was not much flavor. Will not be getting the Chickstar again needless to say. Better off getting the Nacho Bellgrande :)"}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bells go, this one is great! I went the other week for lunch (alone) and actually enjoyed myself, thanks to the $5 Cravings box and pleasant conversation I had with one of the employees (I think his name was Mike). I've been several times since and the employees are all so polite, like Chik-fil-A polite. The dining room was clean and they have free wi-fi. Woohoo!

I've always loved Taco Bell but they tend to be skimpy with the meat...not this location. I can actually get filled up on a meal from here where other locations leave me wanting more. Just writing this is making me think about going there on my lunch break tomorrow...LOL!"}
{"text":"very disappointed to find they were not accepting cards at the time-- I understand things break down.. but then proceeded to be spoken to VERY rudely, until finally we drove off because everything seemed to fail to be up and running."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing freaking Taco Bell. But yet, here are my fingers briskly typing my love (or non-dislike) of this venerated establishment.

Now, everyone has their own weakness for crappy fast food. Some people swear by the drunken White Castle run, some secretly call on Colonel Sanders for a quick hunger break, but I willingly run for the border about once a month or so when the mood strikes me. 

My life just wouldn't be the same without the occasional two crunchy tacos and Burrito Supreme with tons of Fire sauce."}
{"text":"Great Taco Bell. They always ask a couple of times if you want sauce, and I've never NEVER had my order messed up here. That can't be said for a lot of other fast food places nowadays.

:)"}
{"text":"I used to love this taco bell, but for some reason, as of late, the chicken and steak I get from here has started tasting strange and being very soft, unlike how it used to be slightly firm and chewy. It's almost as if it's slightly old.

I don't know if Taco Bell made a large area update to their steak or chicken, but since steak used to be my favorite meat for many items and it tastes strange at this taco bell (can't speak for others since I only really go to this one, as it's closest), I've kind of lost my taste of it.

I still like seasoned beef a great deal, though."}
{"text":"I used to go to this taco bell all the time because we lived near it. Unfortunately we don't anymore, so I haven't been in ages.

Our order was rarely wrong at this taco bell. We always check our item bag before leaving and pretty infrequently was it missing anything.

The quality of food seemed to vary wildly. Sometimes I'd get such great foods that it reminded me why Taco Bell is one of my favorite fast food restaurants, and other times I severely regretted not going to Jack in the Box across the street instead when I needed a quick fix.

I don't know why, but Taco Bells are really lacking in 24-hours open around here. I only know of one taco bell in Las Vegas open 24 hours, but it's pretty far. This is only a minor complaint, though.

Finally, there was the mobile app. My partner and I really liked using the mobile app so we wouldn't be rushed at the order window and could also claim additional little discounts through the app. Taco bell coupons are like nonexistent after all, for some reason. Anyways, at some point, the store no longer was available to us on the mobile app. It said \"Mobile ordering unavailable at this location.\" Kinda made us sad."}
{"text":"Taco Bell has always been a favorite fast food restaurant but the service here is what made the visit.  Drive thru, little bit of a line but was offered cini twists for the wait and advised to be careful with food because its fresh and could burn.  This Taco Bell cares about its customers =] I'm a picky eater and got a few special items and had no issues."}
{"text":"I tried. I really really tried to like Mexican fast food, but sadly, I just couldn't. Taco Bell has this weird aftertaste that I just couldn't get over. The meat. It was the meat that had that funny taste. From now on, I'm only getting veggie stuff there. If anything at all."}
{"text":"Very nice! Darnell my cashier, seemed very knowledgeable and was very quick, pleasant and helpful! Had a very cheap and impressive lunch!"}
{"text":"I've never left a Yelp review in my whole life, but woah. This is the food I was given and was refused any kind of refund? I asked if I could come back with the receipt the next day because it was late and they were about to close. (I had this picture and could've just kept the burrito in the fridge I guess). The person I talked to was super snappy and rude and told me they could remake it or else too bad. I didn't really want anything else since my order has been messed up in the past and this just grossed me out :l won't be going back."}
{"text":"We ate here. We had tacos. They are 33% real meat, we knew that. Two people were full for $8 and we took one home. Stomach full, you can continue your day without incident. That is Taco Bell. This is an average everyday Taco Bell. The staff was nice.  Questionable people were sitting outside so we sat inside. This is also a good munchies stop if that is your thing I have used Taco Bell for that in my lifetime. Who needs real meat? Full of hormones anyhow....."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars because I LOVE Taco Bell, however the service was really slow and the drive thru was backed up where they were taking too long to get the orders out. I'll say it's probably management who can't get it's team organized.
They also have people just loitering outside the building which made it uncomfortable. 
My Sierra Mist tasted flat where they haven't changed the filter to give it the sweet taste.

When I went to eat my food it was cold. I only live 5 minutes away.
I noticed that my Gordita Crunch; the flower tortilla was cold and raw. They didn't even attempt to cook it. My tacos were the same issue, cold when I got home.
Definitely the last time I go to that location. 
I'll be going to North Hills next time.
Management needs to improve majorly."}
{"text":"Manager got on the mic to tell me that they closed early and wouldn't be serving me.  Open sign on... closed before posted hours.  Killing me.

I hope management takes note."}
{"text":"15 mins and counting... Drive through. Single car.. Nuff said.. 5 soft tacos. Outrageous."}
{"text":"Always went there for happy hour just to buy the slurpys.  Good customer service.  And got our food fast. Always ate the big box."}
{"text":"They seem to always do something wrong. I ordered a grande meal, a few nachos and a pinto and cheese. The 3 hard tacos where underneath the 4 bean burritos and the soft tacos.  So of course they where completely squished and broken. There was red sauce all over inside my bag. They handed me food from the order behind and had me hand it back in then check the bags to make sure it was my order and not the next car. Total disaster."}
{"text":"Man I dont expect much when I come here. But today the order lady could not have been any less monotone and unhappy. You could almost read PLEASE KILL ME on her face. Wow she sets a new low bar for employee. Morale!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru line of my life. It's been 15 minutes and I still haven't been able to order yet."}
{"text":"they are slow, they always mess up my order and the last time I went I was involved in a gut and run and the managers Alex and Mike were extra rude. Alex had someone pretend he wasnt there, then hung up the phone on me when i did talk to him and said he didnt care and a hit and run wasn't a real crime anyway. I had to call the corporate office twice just to get someone to assist me."}
{"text":"It's pretty difficult to review fast food chain restaurants.  Everyone knows what to expect anyways.  Thus, I think 95% of them would just get a 3 star rating from me.

This location is a bit cleaner than most.  I've never had to do the grab a napkin and do the table wipedown myself.  Sometimes when places get busy the tables go uncleared for a while and you have to wipe them yourself.  This location gets a little busy during lunchtime but they handle it real well.

Additionally there is an employee who works at the register (Chelsea) that is always just super friendly and happy.  She's there most weekdays.

As with most taco bell's the food is prepared really fast.  Sometimes I won't even bother sitting down because I know they'll call my number as soon as I do sit.

edit: I have a new crush.  The original Chelsea isn't there anymore, but there is a new girl also named Chelsea.  She's got pink hair with streaks of blue.  She reminds me of Princess Cadence from My Little Pony.  She's my destiny."}
{"text":"Pretty consistent, if you haven't had it before, you've got to be foreign, like outer space ;)"}
{"text":"Top faves: 7- Layer burrito (vegetarian fave), soft taco, meximelt & bean burrito. 

I've always had a thing for Taco Bell since I was a kid. It's cheap and with recent studies-- it's HEALTHY. I don't care if it's only 30% actual meat, it all comes out the same, right? ;) 

Restaurant is nearby. Dining area is clean, restroom is clean and staff is friendly, most the time. 

Return visits? All the time!"}
{"text":"Second time to get drive thru food here (first one was yesterday). Fast service and friendly staff. Delicious food. Excellent"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is a go to spot of mine right by my house. All the items are always correct and they always hook it up with lots of sauce."}
{"text":"Not a single person in the store at 8:30 in the morning, we are riding bikes and walk in and the girl says \"you can't have bikes in here\".how about \"I'm sorrywe don't allow bikes in here\" someone needs to go back to Taco Bell college and learn how to be nice."}
{"text":"Whenever Im feelin dangerous or Im hammered (or both) I stop at TB.  This one always has nice employees who are quick.  Despite all the carrying on and yelling I hear coming outa here the food always comes out right.  What else can I ask for, right?  Now they need a remedy for the hot lava ass I get the next day..."}
{"text":"This taco bell is still new and they have become much faster and are what you expect from a taco bell. I would recommend ot to anyone. No issues here anymore."}
{"text":"Every time I go, I have to tell them that the drive-thru sign is wrong and get my price adjusted. Today they refused to honor the listed price, which is illegal."}
{"text":"Everytime in go my order is wrong.  I ordered  Fiesta chicken salad and it came without the side salsa.
The 2 crunchy nacho dorieto tacos we're Cool Ranch and for some reason and empty restaurant has no empanadas at 9pm. Call the number listed on the receipt to complain and its a non working number.  I have lived in the area for 4 years now and my orders are always messed up and I hate going to Taco Bell but when the family wants Taco Bell we go and the orders are always messed up! Always! 
The end of the tomatoes are in my salad because nobody bothers to take them off ever. This is the worst most inconsistent Taco Bell I had ever been to and I don't even go during the busy hours.  I don't know if they need to change owners or what but I'm going to stop going. I've wasted so much money at this establishment on crappy food the employees must not care about their jobs."}
{"text":"Where is the dog meat taco? Also, it took 7 hours to get a cinna twist and a 12 pack of hot LeBron juice cinnamon sliders. 

Bunch of Chads and Tyrones working here ruining my love's curtains."}
{"text":"It took some time to take order -they had two staff members at that time. One was serving the drive through, other was just leaving. He did not appear to be caring about the customers. He actually left, went out, remembered something, came back but did not serve us, waited for his colleague to look at us. 

Ambience is great. 
They have fancy tables that appear to be specifically designed for kids!
And the good thoughts hanging all around the dining area do not make you feel that it took lot of time to get the food. 
When they were not able to serve everything together and they saw us get started, the waiter came along to serve the remaining stuff on our table, specifically appreciated."}
{"text":"This morning I ordered 6 \"crunchy\" tacos. But the shells of the tacos were so wet and soft that I would bet my money those tacos were probably leftovers from last night. I've eaten a lot at taco bells in the past, this experience was one of the worst in my life. Poor quality control."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here today.  I showed up at 7am for my bi-weekly breakfast crunchwrap, and they were closed.  Despite the fact their Google page lists them as opening at 7am, like every other Taco Bell in Clark County, they've decided to open at 8am and not tell anyone about it.  I cannot recommend a business that lies to its customers about its opening and closing times."}
{"text":"This evening, i went through the drive thru to order a salad and Mountain dew baja blast smoothie.  My daughter loves these and i've ordered them before in the past couple of months and I've been told on many occasions that the smoothie drinks were not working. As I ordered it tonight, I wasnt too surprised when they said again it wasnt working. This time, however when I got to the window, a very friendly guy (no name tag, but he had black hair, hat and earring) told me that I could order any drink i wanted and that it was on the house and that he was sorry for my inconvenience. 
wow, GREAT customer service. he smiled, and told me to have an awesome evening!  Fast  and friendly service!!! Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Drive thru line is a little slower than I expected but the staff is friendly and got my order right."}
{"text":"What happened, Taco Bell? We used to be friends!

Contrary to what most people have claimed, I've never had any issues at 67th Ave and Happy Valley. The drive thru lane is rarely clogged, they've never made mistakes with my order, and the staff has always been very polite.

And then, it's like everything changed - like a soccer Mom attempting to reinvent herself after being freshly divorced and looking ridiculous as a result.  

I'm not sure entirely what happened. Either they hired one imbecile to run the kitchen who can't get orders correct, or the crew seems to get their kicks from seeing how many consecutive screw-ups it takes before a customer reaches his or her breaking point.

During my last three consecutive orders, my taco supremes (which I pay extra for) were discovered to be nothing more than regular tacos. Three consecutive times! I mean, do I really have to literally unwrap every single item at the window just to ensure that they didn't screw it up?

If they're not out of Baja Blast, then it often ends up being flat. I've learned to taste my drink immediately to identify if this is the case, but when calling it to their attention, they only offer to give me something else rather than actually switch out the container with a new one - which would require too much work on their part. Hell, maybe I should just offer to go back there and do it myself next time.

Once I smartened up to their error-prone ways, I've started discovering their mistakes before actually leaving. Although despite requesting that they fix the errors, the food still ends up being incorrect. Additionally, their cinnamon twists seem to lack actual cinnamon. They also have a 50% chance of tasting like chemicals due to the employees not changing out the cooking oil when it's required.

It's gotten so bad that if I do want Taco Bell, I'll go out of my way to the one on Pinnacle Peak Road just to reduce the likelihood of the constant mistakes that they keep making here.

Avoid!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, Taco Bell is bad news. You know it - and I know it. But we all have that guilty pleasure that, for whatever reason, provides us with comfort after a rough day. For me, grabbing a Baja Blast and a few Taco Bell items drenched in my favorite (outside) sauce has always been at the top of my list. And I think when you're reviewing Taco Bell, you're better off discussing the service as opposed to the actual food itself. We already know the food is incredibly bad for you, so I'll just skip that part.

This was my go-to location for several years. They've never messed up an order (something many TBs are notorious for doing) and they've always been very polite. Plus, it's a standalone Taco Bell, shared with no sister business. There's just something about those hybrid locations that makes me uneasy. Like they're going to accidentally stick a KFC chicken wing inside my burrito supreme or fear of finding mashed potatoes in place of my sour cream. Oh, the horror!

Unfortunately, despite being a Taco Bell-only location, I've watched the quality quickly drop these last couple of years. There are many evenings where the drive-thru is held up, leaving customers completely trapped if someone pulls in behind you. My worst experience once involved waiting 45 minutes (no joke!) in order to get my food. And what's even more disturbing, is that when I finally made it to the window, they didn't even acknowledge that anything was wrong. No offer to discount my food, no explanation, and most importantly, no apology. There have been several instances where I've been trapped for a good 20-25 minutes and all have taken place in the last year or so.  

Odd, that I've had hold-ups at other locations that have been 1/3 of this time and they've either discounted my meal or offered some free cinnamon twists for my troubles. I don't even ask - they just do it.

The staff seems to be in constant rotation. Yes, I realize that it's fast food, but their turnover rate seems higher than usual. I still stop by every once in awhile, but problems remain.

When I drive by now, I can't help but shake my head when I see the 20-car backups in the drive thru lane.

Avoid during evening hours."}
{"text":"In comparison to the surrounding Taco Bells in the immediate area, this one actually appears to be less error-prone than the others.

Unlike the others, they (rarely) run out of my Baja Blast and have yet to commit Taco Bell's most common screwup: charging for \"supreme\" tacos while forgetting to add the additional ingredients and not realizing it until you arrive home.

As for the KFC food? I rarely order it and with good reason. It's bad, but I can't really blame this location for that. KFC has been universally bad for awhile now, with their chicken usually tasting old, cold, and dry. The quality of their sides barely qualifies as actual food, but that's been an ongoing problem for years.

My advice, stick to the Taco Bell-side. While it's not particularly great, it's at least better than what I've experienced at other locations in terms of consistency."}
{"text":"For fast food, quality service, polite staff, clean location  -you are at the right place."}
{"text":"Since the bf likes taco bell we usually go to this one or one of the others by our apartment. The employees are super nice, the food is always yummy, and its fast!

Its your run of the mill Taco Bell, we go here since the drive thru is open late : )"}
{"text":"Well, its your typical Taco Bell! I do love the beefy cheesy burrito things and the crunchy tacos! The service here was so-so and the location is like a hidden gem next to KFC.

All in all this place is just like any other Taco Bell. Good luck and I hope you dont get the runs!"}
{"text":"This is an above average Taco Bell. I don't think I could ever give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but this one was really great. It's one of the newer updated ones, so the inside area was really nice. 

We ordered for a family of four, and although it was a little bit of a wait, everything tasted really fresh and good. If I'm craving Taco Bell anytime I'm near this one, I won't hesitate to visit again for the good food, nice atmosphere and friendly employees!"}
{"text":"Came in today. I ordered the build your own box. It's a pretty good deal, and was ready rather quickly. 

I ordered 2 soft tacos with no lettuce, nachos instead of fries, passed on the dessert, and another order of nachos (their cheese is just so good). 

Anyway, I get my order, and I got two tacos, both with no lettuce but one is a hard shell, and one is soft. Also, my second order of nachos is missing. I bring it to the girl who is working in the back's attention. Instead of saying something like sorry I'll fix it for you, she blames the girl on the counter and tells her that she rang it in wrong (I don't care who made the mistake, just as long as it's fixed). 

The next part bothered me. I was asking about my missing nachos and the woman  who took my order, said I didn't order them, and I only ordered extra cheese. I said no, I ordered an extra nachos and cheese. She continues to argue with me and says no I didn't I only ordered extra cheese. I understand that the customer is not always right, but I know what I ordered and shouldn't have the woman behind the counter argue about it with me."}
{"text":"dont come here if you have more than one order in a drive thru- like for real they will refuse you service. great food but not so great drive thru"}
{"text":"If my review for the T-Bell in Forest Hills is used as a reference, I can certainly say that this location is terrible. It is as if they dropped the tortilla in a puddle (probably a toilet... get it?) prior to assembling what is supposed to be a delicious meal. By the time I got the food home it was so mushy, cold, and overall dissatisfying that I would've fed it to the dog, but the dog sniffed it as he walked by and decided to chew on his rawhide instead. HIS RAWHIDE - what kind of world are we living in when a dog isn't even interested in Taco Bell? A sick, sad world indeed."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I have a soft spot in my heart for Taco Bell. Nevermind that the soft spot is probably a deposit of fatty plaques as a result of my T-Bell addiction... the real point of the story is that I know my Taco Bell locations quite well, and this site is around the best there is. The service is always fast and surprisingly cordial, they give you an abundance of border sauces, and the tortillas aren't all mushy like at the low quality locations. I definitely hit this place whenever I need my fix."}
{"text":"They are consistent. That much is the case. 
We swing through from Happy Hour freezes. 

$1 and get the blue is my recommend. 
Employees are polite from time to time."}
{"text":"Solid 2.5 

This place can stand to improve on basic things like exterior updating and add some wifi. 

Happy Hour sparklers can make my day better (I'm a non-drinker and this is as close as I think a drink gets)."}
{"text":"Ok, this was so comical that I just left the drive thru window speechless. Pulled up, asked for a chalupa, they didn't have sour cream. Asked for mtn dew, they were out. How about Baja blast? Out. Ok, Pepsi? Out.  Ok cherry Pepsi. Pulled up to the window and the person asks me if I'm the one that got the fire thing. What? And then finally, just to top off the whole experience, they were miraculously out of straws. In the middle of the day, they were somehow completely out of straws and beverages. I wasn't even that mad, but actually impressed by the level of incompetence displayed here."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have had. I go here all the time and never had a problem until now. Last night my mother and I stopped to get something to eat. 
After receiving our order as we reached in the bag to grab our food NONE of our food was wrapped the correct way and our food went EVERYWHERE!!! Taco spilled all in the bag all of the filling was in the bag. 
I tried to call the store to have some one help us out with NO answer at all. 
This is always my go to place and to have an experience like this was absolutely ridiculous. Then I ordered nachoes and received nothing but scraps. 80% of my chips were broken. Just horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Rude staff at drive thru.  They still Made the order wrong adding Jalapeño sauce in a kids quesadilla even when asked not to.  Manager was rude and hung when we called to inform them.  
You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Car broke down in their parking lot. Employees were super impatient about it and interrupted me while I was on the phone with the tow company. Went in to explain the situation to them and they insisted I had to move my broken car NOW and not wait 15 minutes to get it towed. Accused me of being rude for not answering them while on the phone with the tow company."}
{"text":"I was given the wrong drink - I clearly asked for Pepsi and was given Mountain Dew. and refused to take the drink. It was promptly replaced. I wasn't asked for hot sauce at all and had to wait for the order-taker to notice I hadn't driven off yet before I could ask for it, though.

Is it so hard to just get an order right?"}
{"text":"These guys are great! Forgot my wallet and the lady paid for my food! Awesome service!"}
{"text":"A lot of homeless people loitering inside and outside sleeping I a booth taking two tables"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The entire building smelled like sewer and no one flushed the toilet in days. The service was slow and the lady that took the order was not friendly and didn't greet or accommodate me in any way. I won't be returning to this location. When you run a business with so many other locations that you can easily go to a different one. You need to do something that makes you stick out and the experience enjoyable. This location did not do that"}
{"text":"Nice, friendly, clean, T bell! They have been 100% on correctedness of my order in the 20 or so times I have been there. Would give six stars if I were more inebriated!"}
{"text":"This place is a absolute joke.  Went into the drive thru, and after 10 minutes of listening to a car at the window yelling at whoever was working  there, she asked me for my order.  I started, then the gal cut me off saying \" We are out of beans and beef\"  WTF ?  How the hell is Taco Bell out of beans? Got out of my car, asked the cars behind me to back up so I could get the fuck outta there.  This is not the first time I have had problems at this location.  Trust me... It will be my last time there.  And to think these idiots want $15.00 an hour?  Are you kidding me?   Piss off Taco Bell on Buffalo... You SUCK !!!"}
{"text":"Takes FOREVER to get a pizza order.  I have pulled up on multiple occasions and told that there would be a 5 minute wait.  It usually takes double the amount of time and about 40% of the time the order isn't right.  They are constantly out of one thing or another."}
{"text":"I usually love this Taco Bell. Last time I went , not only did they forget most of the order, my crunch wrap was inedible. There was almost no filling and it was pretty much just a tortilla with a broken tostado with a little bit of lettuce and a very small amount of some weird chicken meat ( they usually put the ground chicken) I will never even think of stopping here again. I know it's Taco Bell but I would expect to get all the food I ordered."}
{"text":"I ordered pintos & cheese and a 7-layer burrito.  The beans were rock hard, so I tried to talk to the person at the counter.  I only wanted to let him know that there was something wrong with the beans so they could fix it- I figured that they didn't know.  I have been eating them at Taco Bell for years, so I am pretty sure they shouldn't be rock hard.   The first worker told me that there was nothing wrong with the beans, that they were just \"super low quality\".  Things got worse when I spoke to James, the manger.  When I explained the consistency of the beans (dry, rock hard) he told me not to tell him how to do his job.  Wow!  I will never go to this Taco Bell again!"}
{"text":"For a change, the cashier was chipper and friendly.  But when i buy almost $40 of food, i expect.to be able to get it home safely. Amongst my order was a 12 pack of tacos. They put it in the box. The boxes bottom fell out, not due to any moisture or damage. When i picked.it up out of the car, all 12 tacos went into the street, in the melting nasty water on the street. The tacos were not properly wrapped and fell out of there wrappers. 
Crappy product taco bell. Crappy assembly, and wrapping."}
{"text":"Make sure if you go do you get all your food before you drive out of the drive-thru, they  never remember to give you all your food! And the  Manager is too lazy and rude to deal with the problems!"}
{"text":"Horribly slow

Staff repeats themselves and is slower than molasses in the winter. 

Order wrong again...

Taco salad bowl was stale not fresh"}
{"text":"Last night at 11:58 i had the biggest pregnancy craving for taco bell, so we went through the drive through not realizing how long they open till...
The drive through was still open and a young man took our order. 
Everything was fine until we were given our food with a side of attitude. 

The young man handed the food to us and said \"Thank you SO MUCH for visiting us SO LATE\" and shuts the light off in the drive through...
Honestly, if I knew that they were closing in like 2 mins, I would not have ordered. I don't want any chance of people spitting in my food... 

Im still giving this place a 3 star for letting me order and still giving us a decent togo.  But next time, please do not serve people with a side of attitude."}
{"text":"So this place sucks and lacks proper training on dealing with customers. I order a burrito and empanadas. I pull up to the window and the lady tells me my total I hand her my card she swipes and charges me. Then asks me to pull forward and wait because they needed to cook another empanada.. I ask her how long she had told me 6 minutes.... I tell her just refund me the money for that one empanada. Another employee tells me I'll just give you a dollar back. I told her that 1 dollar is the cost of it but that's not the total after taxes. She gave me the biggest eye roll with attitude and said here it's 1.08. I understand this is Taco Bell and that it's not gourmet but what ever happened to quality customer service? You lost business here from me for good. Oh and another thing I noticed...Why is it that the machines are always broken when it comes to happy hour for the breezes? Then after happy hour is over it seems to be working again? Hmmmm....,"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks. Nachos always have close to zero nacho cheese on them, a HUGE slab of gross retried beans right in the center, 3 tomato peices, a tiny dash of sour cream/guac that I replace the beef for. Every. Time. 5 layer burritos are the same way, proportioned awfully. First bite you'll get beef, second you'll get all the gross \"beans\" then the rest is just mostly those gross beans, maybe a little beef and a dash of sour cream. Nacho cheese also a bare minimum. Oh and they ask if you want sauce and you tell them which kind but they don't put it in the bag. Sucks."}
{"text":"The day crew has a very pleasant attitude...however, it should NEVER EVER take 20 minutes at 2p.m. with only 3 cars in line.  I have found this to be on a consistent basis.  And I go there very often hoping it will change!"}
{"text":"The worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I have been here multiple times hoping it would improve every time. Sadly it never does! The first time I ordered a chalupa, the tortilla wasn't even toasted. I decided it might have just been a careless mistake. So the next time I went I order it again..nope, still not toasted. Everything on the menu taste bland. I don't understand why this location has such good ratings because everyone I have talked to agrees that this location is horrible."}
{"text":"I go to this Taco Bell every once in a while because it's close to home. For the most part my orders are always right, but my favorite part of this Taco Bell is Alani. She is so sweet, and so efficient. I never go inside the restaurant but I know the drive through is pretty fast. Today I had a problem with my order, I think it was hunger mixed with poor communication, but Alani fixed it as usual and tried to make me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"your tacos have one teaspoon of beef you cheap skates and your crunchwrap was empty. i wont go there anymore :("}
{"text":"Sitting here 15 minutes to closing time and they are already closed what kinda bullshit is that?"}
{"text":"I don't know why we have to suffer with a terrible Taco Bell so close to us. It seems silly that, when the Taco Bell craving comes on, we should drive past one to go to one better, yet I think I should start doing this now.

Though it's been through several changes in management in the two years we've lived in this area, this Taco Bell is almost always the same: lackluster, unenthusiastic employees and dirty surroundings. The tables are never, ever clean, and there is rarely someone at the front - the cooks have to call for someone to get to the register when someone comes in.

Last time we were there, there were no straws, the tables were dirty despite having been open only 5 minutes, and the drink machine was malfunctioning, spraying soda everywhere. Also, it made my tummy hurt."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell. There food is amazing and makes your mouth water at the smell. Sure they may not be 100 percent Mexican food such as an actual Mexican restaurant, but they make burritos to die for and tacos to eat for days. I've never not be satisfied by there delicious nachos with cheesy nacho cheese and ground beef and beans and juicy tomatoes. Recommend if you want something easy and good to go through the drive through and grab a bite to eat while on the road."}
{"text":"Probably the cleanest TB I've ever visited.  It looked like pretty capable staffing with actual adults running the place.  I was actually a little confused when I didn't have an obvious stoner giving me the lazy stare over the counter.  It's a slightly hard to notice corner location, but still, good location with access from 90."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell. Certainly you haven't come here with Rick Bayless expectations, but it's still a top tier fast food choice. The interior is great and clean, and the staff is generally friendly, but that's about where the good vibes start falling. 

Go between lunch and early dinner hours, and you'll never have an issue.  At least, I haven't. 

After 730pm, however, avoid it. Mistakes aplenty (two tacos had no meat!) from the drivethru, the waits get longer as the night goes on, and if you think you want to stop here around \"fourth meal\" time, prepare to be overwhelmed by how much they've run out of. It's a little disheartening due to the proximity of our drill location, but we still forget the late night issue and get suckered in once a month."}
{"text":"Gotta love the dbacks special... Every time they score 6 runs,  its 3 free tacos with a drink the next day... And thats the only reason I come here.   The meat is tasty and seasoned well,  but I can't help but think I could make better tacos at home.  OK,  so It's probably cheaper and deffently easier to get the Dbacks special,  so I'll be back to Taco Bell the next time the Dbacks score 6 runs.  Average food for a way better than average price,  what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"After all the commercials airing on TV and radio,  Taco Bell finally wore me down and I ordered a couple of their waffle tacos.   I have a soft spot for waffle based food,  being a big fan of Bruxie in OC,  and it was difficult for me not to compare the two experiences.   

First off,  the waffle.   It was more along the eggo waffle lines than somthing you would make for yourself,  made thin enough to fold without breaking.   They filled it with eggs,  cheese and sausage (or bacon), and even though the eggs are probably powered and definitely rubbery,  it auctiually works.   Pour the syrup they give you on the side over it,  and it works even better.  Also of note,  it was pretty small.   It's a good thing I ordered 2, but it makes me question if it's even worth $1.99.  

The Waffle taco is deffently worth a try,  but I'm not sure if it will be somthing I go back for on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying that I looove Taco Bell. We decided to hit the drive thru like any other night. Pulled in at 10:21 pm. Waited about 5 minutes without hearing any voices from the drive thru speaker before pulling around to the window. I couldn't believe my eyes. The restaurant was completely closed down for the night! It clearly showed the drive thru hours on the window Sunday's open till 11 pm. We pulled around to the front to check to see if anything was posted about closing early for Mother's Day... nope, nothing. Had to drive 5 miles to a different location. Very disappointing and inconvenient."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell. I'm a Taco Bell freak. I live very close to this location, and they have never gotten my order correct. I ordered a bean burrito, I got a potato burrito. My taco had absolutely no meat in it. My taco salad had no beans. All of these were never resolved because I go through the drive through and by the time I get home I do not want to travel all the way back. They should take more time to get the orders correct and make sure they are giving out better quality food."}
{"text":"Tina R. (aka Patrice and Manerva) served my same-sex date and me. She was very friendly and openly acknowledged us as a couple. It's a rare treat to receive quality service in the fast-food industry. Thank you for making us feel welcome, Tina!!!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for over 20 minutes, behind about 10 cars, only to reach the window and be told they had changed their closing hours, they're now closed, and unable to serve me or the 10 other customers in front of and behind me. They need to find a way to inform long-waiting customers that they won't be served, so the customers don't waste their time waiting. Pathetic customer service, even for Taco Bell. Sad!"}
{"text":"I walked into a this joint and I wish my wife was this filthy after a couple of cocktails.  I got a good look of this dump too because I walked in to no line.  Sweet right, no line, by passing the suckers in drive thru.  Wrong this staff of mouth breathers looked at me said someone would be right with me, which was a lie.  I stood there for 12 minutes before some Ginger came out and finally noticed I was waiting there. 

Food was good, but the service blows."}
{"text":"This should be the model that all Taco Bell's strive too.  Orders are always accurate.  Service is quick.  And the food tastes how you'd assume Taco Bell would taste like.  The Drive thru guy tonight DeCarlo was extremely professional, quick and friendly.  He also put the appropriate number to mild sauce in the bag.  That guy is management material...."}
{"text":"As not the place itself that bothers me being an excellent location but the employees (horrible!)
First their is this one guy with his gut hanging out his taco bell shirt (always) / everyone else except the girls looks literally like they are on drugs. 
Taco Bell should be an in and out affair, not regretting it since replacing your order."}
{"text":"You will never find a worse Taco Bell in the entire world.... Every single order is ALWAYS messed up, cashier has no idea what she's doing as she cannot even simply type orders in correctly. It is so slow, you'll be waiting for at least 20 mins so if you don't have time to wait for a messed up order, consider choosing another establishment. Would rate this a ZERO but that's not an option. Never go here."}
{"text":"The man we assumed was the manager was too busy joking around with the employees in the kitchen to notice that the dining room floor was littered with trash and table tops were dirty. When I complained that my Sierra Mist tasted like black mold smells, the nice kid at the register was sympathetic and said he'd report it immediately, but thirty minutes later nobody had done anything to the drink dispenser and I winced when two young girls went up to get their cups filled. That manager needs to direct his efforts toward keeping the business clean instead of fooling around with the employees."}
{"text":"late night snack.. thats taco bell for ya"}
{"text":"Imbeciles - \"forgot\" half of my drive-through order, and didn't notice until I got home. No apologies or anything. This place sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in need of fast crunchy tacos, taco bell is the spot. It is what is is! They are trying to amp of the brand with the new Doritos tacos, which are pretty good,  but nothing to rave about. I usually get the standard crunchy tacos and a pintos & cheese cup. I can fell satisfied for under $4. This location is probably the original design of Taco Bell and it's real small inside but has a good size outdoor seating area. I like that some things are not modernized."}
{"text":"Friendliest cashier at any fast food place that I've ever been to. They should hang on to this guy. It's hard to get good customer service at restaurants now a days. My receipt says his name is Cesar C. Not much of a wait. Food here is the same at any other Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this KFC/Taco Bell has no reviews. Nevertheless, this location, in my opinion, is the worst ever. I used to use the drive-thru, but after an incorrect order almost every time, I've found it easier to just go inside. But then, even when ordering inside, orders are still wrong. The food is the same as all the other KFCs and Taco Bells, but the staff is what brings this place down. Tonight they were out of chicken. Out of chicken! Well, out of Extra Crispy. And even what they did have was not enough to fill an 8-piece meal without mixing Original & Extra Crispy. That's fine, okay, I'll take it. But then I observed as the employee preparing my order grabbed a bunch of individual sized containers of cole slaw and dumped them into a larger container for my order. What? Oh well, it's still yummy. It just seems like this spot needs to be organized and trained a little more. Why do I return? Because it is convenient and the closest KFC to home."}
{"text":"They have attitudes and they give you cold food sometimes and then get mad smh ... I just wanted my food fresh that's all smh"}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell in Vegas.   Food is always hot!  We don't eat taco bell that often, but when we want it, we go out of our way to this location!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is so close to us and easily accessible so this where I usually come. The last few months the service has been very slow. I can't remember the last time it didn't take longer than 15 minutes to get my food after ordering. However the employees are usually friendly and apologetic and most offer free drink or dessert for the long wait. Today the staff was less than desirable. The counter girl was cold and appeared to have an attitude. Another customer asked her how much longer the wait would be and without missing a beat she replied \"I don't know, I'm a counter person\" and walked away. The staff preparing the food were laughing and joking about almost dropping someone's food. When my food was finally ready, (about 15 minutes) I asked the guy for me drinks because I had not gotten them. He proceeded to tell the counter girl she was responsible for getting the drinks order she shrugged him off saying she didn't know and again just walked away saying she's busy and has things to do. She's been cleaning the dinning area this whole time. Also heard a very loud employee complain about managers and other employees not doing their jobs and how she just didn't care who was listening. I can deal with the long wait time, I just don't ever stop when I'm in a hurry, because of the usually friendly employees but when the employees are clearly not happy and letting it be known through their attitudes, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I should have walked out the second I walked in. It smells so horrible in here, that it'll make you lose your appetite. Wait in the long ass drive through. Don't come inside."}
{"text":"They're really nice at this pLace but I REALLY don't know what takes so long. If you're in a hurry DO NOT come to this location."}
{"text":"I sent my husband for a taco and burrito supreme.  The burrito was cold as if it was in the refrigerator and the taco shell was very stale.. #disappointed.. too late to drive back on the car to let them know about the order.."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst Taco Bell any customer can visit. This is not a lie when I say they have messed up on more than 8 times out 10 visits. My most recent visit through the drive thru was met with a long wait, when I finally got my food, I parked double to check my order which I normally don't need to do with other locations, however, this one is always wrong. Sure enough a mistake was made, I ordered a Mexican pizza and when I opened the box it was only the shell, meat and Salsa top. Missing ingredients such as Cheese and Tomatoes. How does a pizza not have cheese at least. When I go back in, and tell the unfriendly cashier, I get the drive thru guy ask me what's wrong? I answer no cheese on it, he responds did you order no cheese? I say No, he gives the Mexican pizza to his person who makes the food, she throws on some cheese and tomatoes and he goes back to his Drive thru responsibilities. I specifically asked them to remake so it wouldn't overcook or burn. This request was denied as they re-handed me the one they had already made. Can't say I was disappointed once again, since no one apologized or said sorry. I hope corporate pays them a surprise visit to see how bad this place is. Btw I used a Free Taco coupon on this order since they messed up on my previous order as well. This time I got no recourse, just a dirty look for speaking up when my order was incorrectly made. Please Taco Bell Corporate DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Always clean and pretty friendly. Mostly utilize drive through. Definitely fast and they get order right. One time they forgot sauce which I dunno about you other people but that's worth it to minus a star. Besides that this is one of the good Taco Bell's."}
{"text":"I feel strange about writing a review for Taco Bell, but this location is the best of the best in fast food. The customer service is always top notch. The employees are friendly and joyful every single time. I've never had a bad experience at this location. I'm also completely in awe of their multi-tasking skills because I don't think I could do as much as they do as well as they do. Did I mention that they are happy and friendly while doing it all? This is definitely my preferred location."}
{"text":"Seriously, this Taco Bell rocks. Of course I love the food so no surprise there, but I am SO impressed by how fast this drive thru line moves, every single time! I work nearby so I frequent this location for lunch, and the staff members all greet me by name, hand out coupons, tell me about specials, and are just very friendly in general."}
{"text":"I've never been a big Taco Bell person but I have been to this one a few times because of how close it is to my work. The last 2 times I have been here has been a 5 star experience though so I feel like they deserve some kudos. The girl at the front (I think her name is Kim) is so nice and knows the menu up and down. (I ate alone so people watching was my entertainment) She greets people and gets their orders quickly, never had much of a line, never had to ask for help. When she wasn't at the front she was cleaning up the eating area and I have to say, it was very clean. 
On a food note, my order was correct and came out promptly. Only complaint: $1.79 for a small drink"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Rude, slow, and nasty. It's interesting how the food tastes very different from other Taco Bell in the sense that it's cold and not cooked all the way. Done with this Taco Bell. I'll drive farther for better service and food. This establishment is a joke."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The 5 star review is based on a baseline for the average Taco Bell which frankly isn't the most highly prized food establishment.  I would say only 50% of the time they get my order right and I don't make a habit of eating there but sometimes it's cheap and easy for this vegan.

After getting dragged into work for a 14 hour emergency day on a Saturday I was seriously hungry when I finally left the office shortly after midnight. I have had this experience at this particular Taco Bell once before but had long forgotten about it. A few cars were in the drive-thru for some late night nosh, when I pulled up the speaker boomed:

 \" AND HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? \" \" THAT\"S FANNNNNTASTIC!! \" \" WHAT WILL YOU BE DINING ON THIS EVENING?\"(I am paraphrasing). 

The window/order taker was a riot. I entertained him back an forth, when I ordered a Tostada(no cheese) and a Bean and Rice burrito with no cheese his reaction was \" MMM, That sounds delicious! \" After 14 hours staring at a computer this put a smile on my face. When I got to the window part of the act was over but they guy was super friendly and honestly looked like he was having a good time.

Lot's of people treat fast food workers like they are second class citizens and I haven't figured that one out yet.  If someone can work a late Saturday night fast food job and to put a smile on a customers face while keeping sane then he is a better man then I. 

To top it off, he had my drink, bag of food,and fire sauce ready and waiting. Uber fast and friendly service. This guy(and late night crew) should make the rounds to other establishments. They could teach the places that charge $9.99(rather then .99) for a taco a think or two.

Hit this late night drive-thru for great service and some comic relief."}
{"text":"My kids and I come here very often. Tonight we came here and Katrina R. took our order. From the time she asked what we wanted, until we got our food she had a complete attitude."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars, but, come on...it's Taco Bell.  It was quick, tasty, and cheap.   I really enjoyed my frito pie slider. My son was jealous. He wasn't overjoyed with his burrito, but, realistically, he doesn't appreciate when spices are involved."}
{"text":"Really fresh!  Amazingly well prepared for a fast food joint!  Very clean interior also"}
{"text":"They service, and actual ice, and cold fountain drinks, put the noblestown rd store to shame! Noblestown needs to close if they cannot keep up to the standard of the north side store!"}
{"text":"This location has a huge issue with ordering \"no lettuce\" they must be paid off by the lettuce mafia, as they always want to do more work, to add something you specifically asked to exclude! I find no other reason! This is the only franchise that forces lettuce on you, when you ask no lettuce!  They must be in the lettuce mafia! Or just IGNORANT! How hard is it for you to NOT add a topping? I'm asking you to do less work, yet you ALWAYS SCREW this up at this location only! The north side store understands, and listens to my requests! Why does the noblestown store fuck up my order, EVERYTIME? AND THE IN-STORE HAS NO ICE FOR EAT IN, AND THE POP, SODA IS ALWAYS FLAT? do you plan to correct this in the next two days, before I reach out to corporate, letting them know ALL the shortcomings, and how you're staff ignored by actual order! Never mind, I'm going to corporate, we've had this issue at the noblestown store for close to a year! Your store is awful! And needs shut down! Maybe the health dept feels the same way!"}
{"text":"its a nice stop on the way to pineville and has a captain D's in the same building! so a little bit for everyone."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell was the worst one I've ever been too. I had to repeat my order 4-5 times and I also checked with the drive through person to make sure the order was correct. When I get home half the order was wrong, 2 things were missing. I called and the employees were rude. Needless to say never again."}
{"text":"I hardly ever review fast food places but this location is fast, fresh, clean and super friendly!! My only grip is I was really craving Dr. Pepper! Shucks."}
{"text":"This is just a taco bell, like any other. Employees are hit or miss but all within a mild range. No hit is too big a d no miss is too big. Just meh. Conveniently 24 hours, that is a pro. Lots of hobos in the area, many like to ask you for money while you are in the drive thru, that is a con."}
{"text":"Overall I have to say that Taco Bell is great with both food and service at most of their locations that I have visited. This review however is related to my experience with this location, 6111 E Southern Ave, Mesa, AZ 85206. Stopping at the drive thru around 10:30 am I ordered the breakfast crunch wrap (steak) only to be told that they ran out of eggs! Having worked fast food myself, along with my passenger we both agreed that the employees have not run out of eggs but cleaned up and now are only serving regular menu items. Perhaps they really did run out of eggs that morning, but my experiences from working in fast food is that most places like Taco Bell run a pretty tight operation whereas inventory is the backbone to the operation and seems to be the priority of just about every manager who is on duty."}
{"text":"Even though they mess my order up every time, it's still Taco Bell.  What do you expect?"}
{"text":"Tristan hooked us up with a Fiery Doritos Locos Triple Double Crunchwrap (DORITOS SHELL FOREVER) and it was absolute LIFE after a hike and then several beers at North Mountain Brewing Company. 

We got a crap ton of other things, but I won't list them because I don't want to hear your judgements, Susan."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we last came to this location because they were always screwing up our orders. But being that we were babysitting and not in the mood to cook-fast-food became the obvious choice for lunch. Since we had previous issues with missing items or incorrect orders we decided to go in an order. The only special thing I asked was NO SOUR CREAM on the Fully Loaded Nachos, BUT do you think that would get right. 1st I didn't even get the Nachos, and when I did mention it they came out with a huge glob of Sour Cream just staring me in the face. I like so many others am completely reluctant to complain about food and have it redone or sent back in fear of it being defiled or spit on-Who hasn't watched \"Waiting...\"? So I just scooped off the SC myself and fed the hungry monsters. The food was all there but it is so disgusting with meat substance they call beef and all the DAMN beans on everything. Who the hell eats Nachos with beans-I always thought it was chips and cheese maybe add some onions,tomatoes and cilantro. All the damn beans make the chips all soggy. Why is it that the taco salad shell is so light & crispy-the best one I've eaten-but they don't use it for their tacos,etc.? I will say it was rather inexpensive $20 for 4 people but it was not Mexican food by any means. I'm not even sure what they meat like substance is they use but it is surely not any kind of beef I've ever made. This location is the same as any other-it's just Taco Bell in general that sucks!!!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has the best service. Same old same old tired ass food but the guys working here really aim to please.

Closest Taco Bell West of the Strip."}
{"text":"I know we're talking about a Taco Bell here and who really reviews Taco Bell, anyway? But I need to get this off my chest. 

This is officially the worst Taco Bell on the east side. They never make anything right. And they're only nice when the manager is watching.

I went just last night because I left work late and had a meeting and wanted a quick bean burrito on the way. I ordered 2, and it was fast. Too fast, actually. There was nobody in the drive through line at all yet I could hear the manager inside yelling to speed things up. Sure enough, when I got my burritos they were made fast. Too fast, actually. I think they might have had about 2 tablespoons of beans in them. When you make a bean burrito and it is almost devoid of beans you know you've screwed something up.

Now, two unsatisfactory burritos are not enough to earn my first one star review. It actually took some work on their part. I have had so much bad attitude and bad food from this location that I can honestly say I think it's the worst Taco Bell anywhere near me. Go to the one on Lee Rd or on Euclid. (Yeah, I'll drive to East Cleveland for Taco Bell!)"}
{"text":"Worst tasting grilled stuffed burrito of any Taco Bell. Management has no clue. Last visit they started with  \"It's going to be a 15 minute wait\". We left...this restaurant is a disgrace to Madison."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. It's 6:45 on a Saturday, i waited 10 minutes in line for them to tell me they are closing and only have chicken (KFC is also sold here). I ask how is that possible, and the guy working stopped talking. Extremely rude. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"yep lol very disappointing again... ive been there 3 or 4x because its so close to my house... BUT NEVER AGAIN AFTER TONIGHT they closed at 10 my and 3 OTHER CARS where waiting in the drive thru and LEFT... CORPORATE SOULD CARE AND BE MORE INVOLVED IT EVERYONE OF THERE BUSINESS ESPECIALLY THIS ONE.... One of the other times i went ALL the tables were durty and with flies i wish i was joking and the othe 2x i went the WAY WAY WAY OVERLOADED my steak quesadilla with jalapeno sause to the point it was a saugie nasty cream full mess in the rapper when i ate it 5 mins later... i am not one to complain ive worked in customer servers plenty of times so i give the benifet of the dought but CORPORATE THIS IS RIDICULES U HAVE LOST A CUSTOMER PERIOD"}
{"text":"We come to this Taco Bell all the time. There may have been one time that they forgot an item, but things happen and people make mistakes! The drive thru moves quickly the majority of the time. Their employees are always so polite and usually seem very happy to be at work."}
{"text":"What I notice from this this location is inconsistently. Love Taco Bell and happy they are come as you go company. I tried to place an an order several time today and they manager kept blowing my off and using harsh language toward me. I called yelp and Taco Bell cooperate today cause he treated me wrong, no answer. Why would yelp have an online order for you but you don't accept, he kept telling me to go down there. I have an active cc and like my burritos grilled, he still wouldn't accept and told me to F off. Don't know what his issue was and was a paying customer that loves Taco Bell and felt he kept treating me horribly when I called in. Said he was going to call police on me cause I kept calling and \"most companies record their calls for quality\" made me not affraid. I will follow back to cooperate Taco Bell and yelp tomorrow cause of this uncalled behavior. Guy was being horrible and wanted me to order from drivethru, thought it made it easier on both calling it in. The fifth called he said he we will make for pick up and couldn't guarantee he wouldn't sabotage my food. Worst customer experience ever and horrible person running it or pretending he did.
They say the do take out on this yelp page. Tell the manager who wants to fight me I'm on the left. Plus the people who leave a 5 Star have part of the company"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and their customer service is out of this world!! Such lovely and bubbly people, both times I have ordered at this location the associate has brightened my day and put a smile on my face. It is a pleasure to come here!"}
{"text":"Should've driven to Mexico for tacos it would've been so much faster.Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell but there is an employee here who makes me feel very uncomfortable. He works the drive through and makes comments like \"how are you today beautiful\" and other comments along these lines. My recent and final visit to this location he told me he'd \"see me tomorrow\" which doesn't make anyone feel good especially if they don't come to this location very often and it was very creepy. I know this might not seem like a solid reason for a bad review but I really don't feel comfortable returning to this location and I think others should be aware of his behavior."}
{"text":"Quick fast and friendly, can't go too wrong with Taco Bell.  The exterior and interior is clean and well kept. Drive through lane isn't too backed up most of the time and the guys taking your order are always friendly.  It's right off brookpark rd, can't miss it.  The only trouble is getting out of the parking lot at times, it gets really backed up along brookpark rd!"}
{"text":"The drive thru is convenient for late night cravings! Fast service, polite employees and they gave us plenty of sauces and napkins. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Been to this location three times over the last six months, every time I go there I get sick after. When I go to the lake mead location and order the same thing, I'm fine. I don't know what it is about this location but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Said they didn't have fresco style... I'm struggling with this because I'm pretty sure all Taco Bell's have pico..."}
{"text":"Every single time I've ever ordered here they manage to screw it up. AVOID! If you want good service go to the taco bell at grand & Bell."}
{"text":"I've ate here for the past 12 years. Definitely good service. I always know the people working, they've worked there since the beginning. Best taco bell around!"}
{"text":"Drive thru service was expeditious and got our order out to us in a matter of seconds. The food was hot, fresh, and made right without any leaks in the burritos, which is one of my biggest issues with taco bell. I like this location."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service with accurate orders. Love this place to fix my Mexican food cravings in a quick way!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service at this location every time I come. This pparticular time the boy at the window suggested if I would like no sour cream on the extra two grillers that I got and I didn't even know they came with sour cream but he noticed that I didn't want sour cream on my other item so he kind of reminded me to not get sour cream so I thought that was pretty cool and thanks for that because my husband totally wouldn't have ate it if it had sour cream :)"}
{"text":"I just went there and everyone was beyond nice. My order wasn't right and they fixed it right away and didn't charge me for my extra chalupa. As far as Taco Bell's go, this one is pretty legit."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Marisa, an apparent Manager, needs discipline and accountability. I will begin to promote the breakfast \"Crunch Wraps\" at Taco Bell; I love Taco Bell and have taken years to convince my Mexican wife Taco Bell food has an addictive taste not to be ignored. I understand competent and excellent customer service are hard to experience nowadays. Last week, my wife and I ordered our bacon and sausage wraps thru the drive-thru window to be handed two hash browns instead of my little doughnuts (oh how I crave my little munchkin doughnuts with the jelly inside!). When I told the cashier they forgot my doughnuts, he asked for the two hash browns in the bag (Yuck!). I laughed and said, \"really, that is disgusting.\" Marisa came to the window and said unless I give back the hash browns, I will not receive my doughnuts. I spent the rest the morning in unique fascination to eventually contact corporate Taco Bell, who gave me a letter of apology with a coupon to choose one item on them. Umm, I never received my four doughnuts. \"We love you too,\" Taco Bell, but Marisa should find another occupation."}
{"text":"The service wasn't so good. Very nice cashier, just a little slow. Our food took forever and we didn't even order much. When we did get our food, it was wrong. I ordered no tomatoes, and I found many tomatoes in my food. Also, an employee went into the bathroom and didn't bother washing her hands, which is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell in the area. Very clean and very good managers and service. They're kind and willing to go the extra mile."}
{"text":"Taco Hell. Cheap mass produced horse meat (allegedly), plastic yellow \"cheese\" in a high fructose corn shell, YUMMY.

No seriously, it IS yummy. I indulge in Taco Bell every now and then, when I'm not eating Chipotle - being all snobby and high-sadity (pretty sure \"sadity\" is not a real word but it stays). 

Sometimes you get a pretty decent taco or a good cheesy gordita crunch.

Other times you get a broken shell with barely any mystery meat or the cheese on the cheesy gordita crunch is not even melted. 

I will say the lettuce always seems fresh, hahaha.

If you've never ate Taco Bell before, don't."}
{"text":"Taco pizza Mexican pizza it is so good just ask them to put some extra cheese on it and some shredded lettuce on top. I also like the soft chicken tacos supreme."}
{"text":"Taco Bell used to be my go-to place... but now that my metabolism has come to a screeching halt, the trips to Taco Bell are few and far between.  Luckily the closest TB to my house closed down a couple months ago, so this location is the \"closest\" which means a haul just to get there.

This location does have a pretty decent drive thru.  Sometimes it backs up, but it's usually quick (except the one time I got there and they said they had run out of tortillas which basically reduced the menu to two things).  Luck for them they are merged with a Pizza Hut in this location so I went with pizza instead.

As far as facilities go, this building has been here forever!  I remember when it was the only thing over here and the Wally World behind it did not exist.  They have since remodeled to keep up with the times, but the bones of the building are the same.  If there is anything to be said about character of a building, I guess thats probably one thing this place has going for it."}
{"text":"I'm a definite fan of this Taco Bell, in fact... I secretly drive past one Taco Bell to go to this one.  I don't know if it is the newness of the building or the shopping complex it is in, but I've always had good experiences at this Taco Bell as opposed to the one closer to my house.  Everything is kept really clean and the inside is really modern.

My one complaint is that in their attempt to make the interior \"modern\" the front register ended up with a curved metal railing that makes forming a line a bit confusing.  Not that there is ever a huge line here (which is also a plus), but it makes for a free for all if you happen to arrive at the same time as someone else."}
{"text":"I promise you this is the best Taco Bell in all of Las Vegas -they are efficient- they are consistent - they are competent and they are super super friendly -something you will not find at any/many fast food joints -they get your order out quickly and always correctly even tho they get busy as hell because they're open all night unlike most Taco Bell's
 kudos to this location -you rock!!"}
{"text":"My food is always missing something. If I order extra cheese they forget it. I usually get the nachos and I always have to return it due to no toppings"}
{"text":"It's hard not to give a fast food restaurant anything less than a 4 star, because you know exactly what you are going to get.  This location is open early for breakfast which is nice.  It's a standard Taco Bell with friendly staff.  I have only used the drive through at this location.  Standard Taco Bell, with standard Taco Bell food, that is Taco Bell delicious."}
{"text":"I give it no stars at all by far the worst customer service ever manager kim didn't know what she was doing talking about about customer's to employs I will never go back there again"}
{"text":"Pretty livid. After a long night at work I swing through this drive thru. I tell them my order quite straight and forward, no changes, no nonsense. I ask if they still have fiery tacos as I couldn't find it on the menu. I'm told yes, so I say I'd like one. Once at the window, I was asked about my personal life. What I do for work, if I'm given free products from my work, if I just got off work. Just unprofessional. And surprise surprise, my order was not all there. Neither was my receipt so when we called back it was basically a crap shoot. Please learn to focus on your job and not trying to pick me up in the drive thru window. Because of you, I have no dinner. Thanks. Won't be back."}
{"text":"World's slowest drive thru. Don't stop here if you are in a hurry.  Don't let the short line of cars fool you, you will be waiting and waiting and waiting for your food."}
{"text":"This taco bell substituted the limeade sparkler drink for a regular drink in the combo at no extra charge- something some taco bells won't do even for an upcharge. The service on the last 2 visits to the drive thru has been exceptionally friendly also. Much improved! Surprisingly fast also."}
{"text":"I walked into this Taco Bell and was received without any greeting and had to ask to make an order, a young inexperienced teenager attempts to take my order and getting it wrong 3 times with help from a fellow co-worker. I tried to make payment by using a hundred dollar bill and it took 2 workers and the young man taking my order to ask a manager for change. The manger sends the young men out to tell me if I can pay with a debit card or other small bill. I told them I did not have any small bills and I was told they wouldn't be able to serve me. 
    All I can say is WOW! Never have I been treated so badly at a Taco Bell. Might have to try Del-Taco now. This was the Taco Bell/ Long John Silvers close to 59th Ave and Bell Rd."}
{"text":"I ordered soft tacos to go and paid $0.20 to make them all supreme and when I go to eat them I found out that none of them are supreme. Like come on. You had one job. All you had to do was add some sour cream. Thanks"}
{"text":"These guys close early all the time, especially the weekends... It's 1:45 and I know they close at 2... Guy says \"sorry, already closed\" and shut the back door. What the heck!???"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Bell because it is the closest one to my house. So when I decide to fill my mouth-hole with Doritos Locos Tacos of varying colors/spices I come here.

Often I enjoy getting several Doritos Locos Tacos and turning them into a taco rainbow. I then supplement the tacos with whatever bonkers/delicious scheme Taco Bell has come up with in the past week, such as the Grilled STUFT Nacho, which happens to have a festival of basic carbs that make my blood sugar rocket within seconds, meat/beef (?), AND NACHO CHEESE AND RED TORTILLA STRIPS FOR LYFE.

Oh, also Taco Bell has embarked on putting multiple gut-bomb items in a box, so you can forgo the peasant-like plastic bag they put your ONE TACO in - but seriously, who gets one taco when they go to Taco Bell?

I am not a fan of their burritos, as I can get a magnificent burrito from Chipotle. However, I do have a space in my heart for their hot sauces that give me endearing messages.

Other notable mentions: Nachos Bell Grande, any of the items in which they wrap up another food item with a quesadilla-like shell, and the \"Meal Deals\" that come with tiny bags of Doritos, because yes, I need to eat Doritos with my tacos."}
{"text":"Hang onto your Hazmat kit when visiting this taco bell. Conditions inside the restaurant are unhygienic, filthy, nasty and on the verge of being a hazard to public health. Describing the drive-through service as slow would be an understatement of epic proportions. The staff...incompetent, lazy, rude, dimwitted, and generally zombie-like in their overall deportment.   Quality of food :  tacos - soggy, half-filled with rancid mystery meat and soggy lettuce.  (Attempts to contact the management have been unproductive.)
 This franchise will likely self-destruct due to substandard food and customer service, so best of luck to the future owners and management team)"}
{"text":"This is the worst taco bell i've ever been to. I ordered TWO things and yet they still forgot one of the shit that I ordered."}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bell go, this place is pretty great (you could say it is .....  SUPREME! Ha).   

The place is clean, the staff is friendly and smiley, they speak English I can understand, and the drive thru is always open. What more do you need? Of the 5 or so times that I have been here I don't think they've ever messed up my order at all -- which is pretty great considering it is a Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"They keep using nacho cheese on menu items that are supposed to have shredded cheese. Just because it's wrapped in a tortilla doesn't mean I'm not gonna figure it out. Thanks for turning my late night meal into crap."}
{"text":"Sometimes you get so busy in s day that you forget to stop and eat. I do anyway. This was a quick and cheap option while out running around . I've been here before and all those times nothing really stands out. It is ok service, but just ok. I miss the days where younger teens etc knew how to interact and I'm only 40 lol, it makes it so much better when someone gives a little chit chat or even a hello when you walk in and order. The location is clean and I've never had an issue with the food, but service as I said is mediocre and it's like talking to a zombie when you need to speak to an employee"}
{"text":"Great healthy fast food and really happy with music in dining room and the beautiful service people working here at the border"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them 1 star but I have to for yelp. They never get my order right the staff has no idea what's going on, I'm not sure they are even on planet earth or in some other solar system."}
{"text":"Beans were dry and crusty. Gross. Very small portion of pintos & cheese. And scanty on the cheese. Not up to par."}
{"text":"I wouldn't usually give a Tace Bell four stars, but they had something that I really liked and that was their Verde sauce packets. It's similar to the green sauce I get at one of my favorite Mexican restaurant. I like trying things that don't exist where you live.

The food was as I've had in California. Good and filling. The dining area was clean, the bathroom was clean. 

That's it. It's Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Order nacho bell grande, taco fresco style and tostoda through drive through. Took about 2 minutes, window server was very nice and politd. Food was fresh and hot. Not bad for taco bell."}
{"text":"They only do 2 orders per person, so if your doing a Launch run for work drive by this place"}
{"text":"Charged a .39 cent fee to use my credit/debit card. The sign in the window said debit cards are charged. However I handed them my Visa debit/credit card and they used it as a debit instead credit. I did not give them a PIN number. It should have been impossible for them to use my card as a debit without the pin, so how did they do that? I think someone should investigate."}
{"text":"Can someone please just fire this entire staff? There's one guy literally that gets shit right. Other then him, staff is super rude. They messed up my order so I had to go back, since they hadn't given my full order. This was not today however. And the girl in the drive trough says oh. Come trough? come trough how professional is that?! No apology no trying to compensate. Nothing she just handed it to me. Every time I go there something is wrong or something is missing. I just today bought a cheesy Gordita WITHOUT ANY CHEESE IN IT. Other nights they have the whole place looking like it's closed and multiple nights where they have said that their system is down and the whole crew is out chilling and smoking. I am done with this place! Don't even bother people. Buy a salad instead cuz this staff doesn't make it worth even having a cheat meal. I'm sorry to say this but these are the most incompetent people I have ever dealt with. WORST customer service and they just seem like they hate working there!"}
{"text":"I like this location. The employees are all very nice and my order is always right. I will keep coming back here for my Taco Bell fix."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Taco Bell and have been to most of the locations in my area.  This location is fairly close to my house so I come here more often than others.  The employees are all very nice and my order is always right (I always customize my food because I'm not a lettuce/tomato kind of girl).  I have not been inside, only through the drive thru, but they keep the line moving and it does not take long to pick up lunch.

My biggest complaint is the access.  It is on the northeast corner of the intersection with only one entrance that is north of the light.  The parking lot is fairly small and it is next to impossible to make a left out of there to go south (which I always seem to need to do).  I have to turn right and flip a u-y further down the road.  The lights are horribly timed so there are always cars coming from some direction.  It's a bit of a cluster."}
{"text":"It is hard to count to six?!   Really?  I went to this one because the other 1 closer to me treats their horse meat at the price of  Gold.   This one charged me for 6 tacos, But only gave four.   Do I really me to sit there at the drive-through counting tacos?!   Apparently the answer to that is yes.  At least these tacos contained enough  Horse meat to fill 3  Tacos.  For the love of God, Can you at least hire employees who know how to count to the number 6, and have successfully graduated 1st grade.   Fast food is not fast, When you have to verify your drive-through attendant can count to the number 6.  That is not the case at this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Oh good Lord.  I paid for six tacos, and got only enough meat to fill one taco.  If you like paying nine dollars for six 2 cent taco shells filled with shredded lettuce because you are on a diet, this is your place.  But if you are hungry, check their dumpster instead.  It probably has more horse meat of equal quality."}
{"text":"I think it all depends, obviously, on who makes your food, or at least, in part.  I ordered six regular hard tacos.  If you put the meat, which is not exactly expensive, to them, together, of all six tacos, together, it would make for MAYBE 1.5 properly filled tacos.  So instead of paying $1.19 or whatever it is for a taco, mine cost me about $4 bucks each.  Might consider going back for luck of the draw, but when you're hungry, bitting into a taco to have nearly new meet in them is very disappointing.  As they say, \"where's the beef?\"  I really do feel this particular taco bell owes me a $10 gift certificate, because that was just a very very disappointing experience for this hungry man."}
{"text":"Clean, quick, and accurate order -- what more could one want from a taco bell drive through!"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I first moved near here, we saw a review of this Taco Bell that said \"Best Taco Bell in Arizona\" and we laughed and thought it was so funny and dramatic... But now we get it. It totally is! Hahaha. This is always the best Taco Bell!! The employees are extremely nice all of the time. They have the sweetest people working here. Most importantly the food always seems super fresh at all times of the day! Even at midnight the food is hot and yummy. It never seems like anything sits out all day and gets that creepy plastic-ish look and feel. So I agree with the \"Best Taco Bell in Arizona\" statement hahaha."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars for the customer service. Literally just order $15 dollars worth of food and they for my drink and didn't give me a receipt. I'm currently calling them and no answer it keeps ringing. Way to go Taco Bell. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Ah Taco Bell. Cheap but good lunch.

 They offer a good variety for a descent price. My favs are Nachos Supreme, Beef Chalupe,  Cheesy Beef Buro, Cinnabon Delights."}
{"text":"It's a simple...but dirty, cheap pleasure...a bean burrito at taco bell!  Inexpensive, always the same since I was a kid, always fresh,hot and delicious in its own sick way.  I'm not embarrassed to admit this...but don't hold it against me:)  Whenever I want to do a little sneaky binge look for my car here...don't forget to order the mini churros...not a good date food;0"}
{"text":"cheap ... but better than the one on dysart"}
{"text":"A ok for quick cheapo meal."}
{"text":"I use to go to the drive-thru several times a week for the last couple of months it is very slow getting through even if I only have one car in front of me it seems to take forever I don't know if its new employees or what but I've certainly cut my visits down.  They have to drive thru windows here where you can pay at one pick up your food is another perhaps they need to start implementing the second window"}
{"text":"It seems like I'm not the only one who has had problems with rudeness in the drive thru July 5th 7:30 p.m. tried to order in the drive thru guy kept changing my order and laughing seemed like he was trying to toy with my patience. when I got up to the window everything on my order was wrong when I finally did get my order it was like somebody stepped on the burrito and wrapped it up and put it in my bag didn't even touch any of it will be calling the manager if not district manager tomorrow seems all the employees were having a great laugh in the Drive-Thru kept coming up to the window and laughing and walking away I would suggest not giving this business any patronage at all if this kind of management will let these employees work there they don't deserve your business they certainly ain't getting mine anymore"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong... I love Taco Bell.  

This Taco Bell, not so much.

It's hard to go anywhere when the people that work there obviously don't give a flip about their jobs or doing them well.  Have some pride in what you do even if it's not the end-all-be-all of your existence.  

I will drive quickly past this Taco Bell to get to a better one."}
{"text":"I live not too far from this taco bell, and go pretty often.  So I'm not sure if this is a practice across the board with taco bell or just this one.  They are really nice people, never had a problem with the food or any one.  Well I got the catina bowl the other day, and I've had a few of them.  I ordered a side of guacamole, because it's pretty good.  I took my food home, and it took me a little bit to eat it was busy running after my 2 year old.  But any who, the guacamole sat for a few moments and it turned a really funky green that I'm not use to.  Now I've had guacamole from other restaurants and I've never had it turn colors on me, so I'm not sure if this was chilled before I got it or not, but I know I will not order that again.  That's the first time that's ever happened to me.  Maybe it's just me....."}
{"text":"3 of us went to this Taco Bell last night. My order was taken and then the cashier left to go scrape ice. Maybe 3 minutes later someone asked if we had been taken care of. The person running the drive thru came and took the rest of the orders while the cashier was still scraping ice. Our orders took 20 minutes each. Horrible horrible service."}
{"text":"You can tell when there is a Manager on duty that's for sure!!  I usually get fish (which the last 2 times came cool), and greasy ! Had to send it back.....In the meanwhile the bean burrito which usually has onions (had none) and inside was cool temp also, had to send it back!!  In the meanwhile my husband almost was finished with his meal.  They didn't seem to upset with all the mistakes.........OH Did I mention it was a Friday, probably 10 workers in the back (talking), the place was NOT busy and it was 5:30PM..Prime time for dinner.

NO EXCUSE FOR THE BAD FOOD, AND BAD SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Was here a month ago, usually visit with friends twice every season. Last time came during happy hour~ which means a choice of 3 types of burritos for $1 each called Grillers and $1 drinks including Mountain Dew ice slurpies. I tried a black cherry one, very yummy brainfreeze :p. Had the usual volcano taco (it's called something else now) with a Cool Ranch Doritos taco. Tried my friend's Griller from the other side. It has chicken and just sour creme in there no rice or beans. I munched on the chicken, we both felt that creme de sour was too much a texture destroyer. I don't mind since I have no puffing habits but this location does not tolerate indoor smokers of electronic devices. Taco bell is usually a pleasant trip away from burger and fry joints."}
{"text":"Stopped here 3/29 at 2:00pm for lunch. Me and my friend both got a few tacos, I tried a Doritos cool ranch taco and their XL beef taco. I asked for a cup for water and my friend asked for a small soda. The cashier gave us both free drinks of our choice from the machine. I think that's so nice. 

They had this soda- it was apple juice soda. I liked it, yummy ^.^ and Mexican.

I will check if the Taco Bell in my area has new beverages like that one, I doubt it, but it would be pleasant if they upgraded, hahaha. This is the Nicest Taco Bell location, other places get snippy with coupons so we have an easier time using extra ones at drive thru. 

It was a little cold inside, but it's also because the giant snowstorm was about to start soon. 

Grabbed some to go for my brother. Waiting can take 5 minutes. They are joint with Long John Silver's but it didn't seem appetizing to me."}
{"text":"Legendary drunk food that isn't so great sober, Taco Bell is the epitome of American frenzied consumption. The Steelyard location gets a bad rap, but I've always found it to be just what I need on a cold winter night. As a vegetarian, I'll order traditional menu items with beans instead of meat and if I'm feeling frisky, I'll have them add rice too. These bizarre demands don't seem to bother the employees. Drive thru service is usually fast and orderly. The crunchwraps are always perfectly shaped (I keep a small collapsible ruler in my car door in order to measure) and served piping hot. New items show up on the menu with frightening regularity and I eat all of them, savoring each luscious bite. The cheese stuffed taco shell they are now touting is one of the most unholy, decadent, and scrumptious creations ever devised by modern man. Sure, it all gets cold a little fast, and the spice level is nothing compared to Chipotle, but dollar for dollar, T Bell is the best fast food around, particularly for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This place obviously doesn't know how to take orders because I was just there and they screwed up my order. They have never done that before and they didn't give me salsa. I had clearly said i wanted the number 8 and they only gave me my Cinnabon delights and my drink. They need to learn to take orders and get the stick out of their a**. Wouldn't recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give a zero? If I could I would because they earned it. My wife went there to order the fiesta salad with no beans, or rice and paid extra for lettuce. The employee there didn't greet my wife and leave the mic phone on, in which my wife overheard this employee call her a bitch. The next day, my wife attempted to talk to a manager about this incident but was on hold for so long, she finally hang up. She had to go in person to get a refund. Be advised that this location is private owned and not part of the Taco Bell franchise. I will be contacting the corporate office."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but I frequent Taco Bell.  Always a 30 min or more wait for fast food at this location.  Don't stop here as a quick fix for tacos.  Never quick, always under staffed.  Feel sorry for the associates.  Shame on franchise owner and manager.  Staff your franchise!!!!"}
{"text":"My window guy was A-dorable!!! Great service & nice fare. I really crave Taco Bell sometimes & they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. I will be coming back - not too often but definitely returning!!"}
{"text":"I never have any issues at this Taco Bell.  I've been coming here since they opened and I cant remember a time they messed up an order.  Today we ate inside and they brought our oder out to us.  I usually do the drive thru and they are always nice and converse with me at the window.  Its cheap and fast.  I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh, they never seem to get my order wrong.  This is the only taco bell I trust to make my chili cheese burritos, as well as some of my special orders.

The drive thru staff are always friendly and efficient - last time, they complimented my (blue) hair, which always makes my day.

Comparing to other Taco Bells, it deserves five stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken quesadilla and taco combo.  Consistently the order is of various quality.  Usually I just chalk it up to \"typical fast food\".   This morning it was horrible.  The taco had almost no meat, a few shreds of lettuce and cheese was almost nonexistent.  I guess it's typical fast food.  Of coarse I went through the drive through and didn't find this out till I got home.  And you know what Leo Gets said in the movie Lethal Weapon about going through the drive through!  

*****. Update:  well today, no better!  Plus I saw cashier dude was swinging the bathroom key attached to a ladle and pointing at the menu.  I don't know about you but I really don't want to see anything from the bathroom in an employees hands and not washing hands.  Especially in a food place.  Why do I go here??????  Can I do negative stars????"}
{"text":"I LOVE Taco Bell. I LOVE it! 

I HATE this Taco Bell. I have no understanding of why it takes MINIMUM 5 minutes to order and 5 minutes to get your food, when the 35th Ave and Southern is SO much faster, and the people are nicer. I don't understand why at 6:30 after work it takes MINIMUM 15 minutes for \"fast food\". If I ever want Taco Bell fast, I NEVER come to this one because there is zero hustle. I am swearing off this Taco Bell and will go to the other location forever now."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since I was little. Never had any issues here until recently. Was there the other day to grab dinner. I ordered a chalupa meal, 3 soft tacos, 2 grilled stuffed burritos, nachos and cheese and the new nacho fries supreme and a chili cheese burrito! My receipt has everything listed correctly. I got a regular fries and nacho cheese, not the supreme. Ok, let that slide. Honest mistake. Then got to my chili cheese burrito ... what a joke that ended up being. I had more of the tortilla than anything else. Usually they're bursting and the chili cheese gets all over the place. Best part of it. It was as thin as can be. Anorexic chili cheese burrito. Our food ended up being cold and all the tacos ended up being a basic salad! Hardly any meat on anything. Looks like I'll be going to the Columbia road location. It's farther away as I'm on Lorain in Fairview but I'd drive for quality. Pics of the chili cheese to follow. I put a Gatorade cap next to it to show how thin it was."}
{"text":"I'm afraid to give this place 3 stars....only because people obviously hate this place.  I don't eat here much but it is what it is, fast food.  Which means you have to lower your standard.  If I was buying fried chicken at Claim Jumper I would be paying 3-4 times as much and getting service which cost money too.  I occasionally get a craving for original recipe KFC and this is the most NW KFC in my area.  I cant stand Taco Bell and do not understand with all the great fast food Mexican why anyone would go here for that.  I did try to go here once after 9pm and they stopped selling chicken and only served Taco Bell which sucks but I was not surprised, remember these people make minimum wage.  I have never had bad service here and its nothing special either, the inside is pretty clean and the chicken serves its purpose when I get a craving."}
{"text":"Even for Taco Bell, this location is pretty terrible. They get the order wrong more times than not. I've sat in drive though for five minutes only to be told they're closing early--not at the posted time. Last time I went, I was pretty sure the cashier rang up the wrong thing. I clarified with her, than I asked another employee, then I still got the wrong thing and had to bring them back. I'm done."}
{"text":"If I'm out past midnight there is a good chance I'm gonna want to pull into a taco bell drive thru and this location rarely very very rarely screws up my order or forgets the hot sauce or forgets that spork w the Mexican pizza. It's consistently Taco Bell which is all I expect. I totally want a 7 layer burrito right now..."}
{"text":"Quick and inexpensive lunch option, but not a meal I'd want more than once a week. I typically drink water as opposed to soft drinks from the soda fountain. Let's just say the water did not taste like it went through the filter. Throughout the ordering process, dude behind the counter asked me three times if this will be dine-in or carry out."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak burrito with no re fried bean but got a a burrito with only beans. The service was terrible. Consistently getting orders wrong. Would never go back here again."}
{"text":"My favorite TB in Gastonia, food is always freshly made, and served with  smile. They do not add on at the window just an FYI. Which is cool with me cuz when people do it, it takes longer for everyone else. Also, they limit your drive thru separate orders to two depending on who you get. If I have more than two orders, which happens, I go in, cuz I don't suck at life. 

Most taco bells have the same thing so the menu is basic. This one just taste better than the other two in Gastonia. It could be me. 


When dining in, I hardly ever see the restaurant a mess. It does get trashed by local jerks, but someone is always out to pick it up. Bathrooms are normally clean. The rare times they weren't, I mentioned it, and someone went to clean it up right away. 

My only complaint is the nacho toppings are getting light, but if I dine in & say something they correct it. 

Other than that, this Taco Bell is awesome."}
{"text":"My experience was awful I went in the morning to get there breakfast item's and they they were rude about tvthis to I was ordering and they said they didn't have enough hash brown to supply all those items and then they said they didn't have eggs are you kidding me. So I went to dinner for it and the customer service was awful and the food was bad too I would not recommend this taco bell yo anyone. I wish corporate could fix these issues and make this taco bUnell better. Also I was sitting in drive thru for 30 min that is crazy"}
{"text":"The service at this location was horrible. The employees had an attitude the entire process, from ordering to picking up the food. 
Both times I have been here the soda has had no syrup in it, tasted like pure soda water which is disgusting. 
Sure hope they fix what ever is going on with this location, this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Could not believe the way I was treated at this location on the evening of 4/7/15. I stopped by the drive through at exactly 10:31pm which is 29 minutes before the drive through closes. I pulled up to the speaker and no one said anything after a few minutes I pulled ahead to the window. 
I saw the employees cleaning up early and I flagged one down, he told me they were closed. I simply stated that there sign said they were open till 11:00pm which by now was still 15 minutes to go. He said oh well everything is shut off and sent me on my way. 
I couldn't believe it!! Plus there were 4 other cars behind me in the drive through, I'm sure the owner would be glad to know his staff is just throwing money away."}
{"text":"Damn nice im only giving it a five cuz my total was 6.58. Gave the lady 6.75 she gave me 6.00 dollars back  hahaha haha  everything tastes  better when is free.uuuugggghhhh now it's a one star there's mouse traps outside their doors made me sick after eating there"}
{"text":"I know it's partly my fault for going to a Pizza Hut Taco Bell combo but good god this place is dirty food forks napkins all on the ground order one thing to give me something different and then they can't figure out how to just fix it place is disgusting I'll never be back"}
{"text":"Never thought I would review a Taco Bell, but these employees deserve some recognition. I always feel for anyone for works in fast food. They have to deal with the lowest forms of the general populace and likely get paid minimum wage. I don't eat a lot of fast food, but if I do stop here, the drive through people are always very nice, efficient and have yet to mess up my order. This place is well-run to say the least."}
{"text":"I'm not one of those people that like to give one-star rating to fast food eateries.  Those tragic individuals like to give them low star ratings, but still, keep coming back. Lmao, Admit it! Taco Hell is a guilty pleasure. Sure, they are not the healthiest, but they sure have damn good nacho fries! Plus you can't beat the 99 cent menu! Ohkurrrrrr"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if possible. I was left waiting in the drive-through for over 15 minutes because all of the male workers in the restaurant we're too busy flirting with a couple of teenage girls who came in The dining area, And I know this because the bonehead at the drive-through window actually told me that. I was also missing a couple of items from my order because they chose not to pay attention to what they were doing. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The drive thru staff are always very courteous, and they get my order right every time. They are kinda stingy on the hot sauce, but not as bad as some Taco Bell locations. The  drive thru line usually moves pretty quick too."}
{"text":"An absolute embarrassment to the community!!!

Being in the business management field I can't believe this place can even afford to stay open. I literally watched 2 girls up front lie to an elderly gentleman in efforts to talk him out of eating here. They told him it would be long wait for them to make what he wanted.  This was just after they did the same thing to an entire family that ended up leaving without eating.
The employees here are costing this company 100x what they are being paid. That I can guarantee!!!
The sad thing is that I feel sure upper management sees these reviews but does nothing.  What ever happen to taking pride in what you do?
I think I may go back tomorrow and take  a photo of the slackers to post with this review.
Thanks,
Tom"}
{"text":"Just went thru drive they ordered the fiesta taco salad. All that was on it was beef meat and cheese . No sour cream no guacamole and no salsa. I have been here before and they have screwed up almost every time even when I asked for military discount they act smug,but they could not get a taco salad a fiesta taco salad correct it when they asked me what type of meat I wanted chicken steak or whatever I said ground beef they still didn't get it right because that's all the time at ground beef cheese and meat I think there's lettuce but it's really a horrible salad to bring home to my wife who asked for it she had a good one the other day you guys don't deserve more than one star. Called to get it right they do t answer their phone."}
{"text":"Taco Bell - just because I am coming through late night doesn't mean I don't care about my food quality. Yes, I used quality and Taco Bell food in the same sentence. 

After watching the commercial 300 times for that grilled stuft nacho I had to have one. (I'm not sure why I keep calling this the walking nacho - I had to google the real name). I also got a cheese quesadilla.  The food was just awful. They could've just thrown the food in the bag and got the same result. The quesadilla was burnt and didn't have cheese on half of it and the walking nacho had very little meat and just gobs of nacho cheese pouring out of it. 

I am giving 2 stars because I probably should know better than to expect an amazing commercial like meal at Taco Bell - so maybe my dreams were crushed and because the staff was friendly & fast as they ruined my meal."}
{"text":"Wow, that's the second time this Taco Bell has messed up my order. How hard is it to not get cheese and sour cream on a Chalupa? I even said it twice to make sure she understood. Well, it had cheese and sour cream on it. Took it back and the girl said she didn't hear it. The supervisor took the chalupa and threw it in a trash can 15 feet away and started to talk under her breath. Not even a sorry for messing up my order. Oh, the beef didn't taste right, just wanted to finish what we had and get out. Never again. You guys are BAD!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a horrible Taco Bell, probably the worst in the world, and yet I keep hoping it will be different. I ordered a Cantina power burrito and have no clue if it had steak or beans inside. The \"meat\" was that indistinguishable. Plus the burrito was freezing. Then I had a taco, which was completely cracked. The side of rice was all fused together as a giant rice lump. Best of all, they neglected to give me a fork, probably because I could just pick up the aforementioned rice lump and eat it. And the whole thing took like 15 minutes. Why didn't I drive over the grass and go to McDonald's? I was a fool."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible service. The place wasn't even that busy and I felt like an inconvenience for them. Been here a couple of times and it always seems to be the same, But I work in the area so I always think it's going to be quick and this time it was almost a 15 min wait for 2 bean burritos! Lol! Ya I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"I just went through The drive-through of this location and felt compelled to say that the young lady that was working the drive-through was the sweetest young lady I think I've ever talked to. Plus, the food was actually really good! The combination was very satisfying and thank you for my quick lunch. Keep up the good work Young lady!!!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell the food is all the same like all other taco bells. They are horrible because they aren't open like they are supposed to be! They are supposed to be open until 5am. I dove past it looked closed so I called and her reply is they are supposed to be open til 5 but their computer shut down. So even though the hours on their website on their door say one thing they don't honor that. She also mentioned that most nights they close early because the computer issue is an ongoing issue."}
{"text":"Seriously, do I need to say anything more - clean the ice machine.  I would like to give no stars, but Yelp forces a one star.  Shame on me for stopping at Taco Bell.  Shame on Taco Bell employee who told me they don't come to my work and tell me how to clean.  I am not a mold expert but I would say this is at least 60 days build-up."}
{"text":"Friendly service. They were spot on with the special requests I asked with my order. They made sure to offer sauces and did no ice in my drink per my request. The food came out quick. What more could I ask from Taco Bell"}
{"text":"What in the world! Everything we tried to order was unavailable. Do I need to pinch myself and wake up from this bad dream. I was of the understanding that Taco Bell is one of the largest franchises in the world however from my experience tonight, I'm feeling like this is a small mom-and-pop shop going out of business and selling their final vittles.

My drive-through order went a little something like this: 
Cashier: Welcome to Taco Bell, may I take your order?
Me: Hi, can I get a chicken crunch wrap supreme?
Cashier: Sorry we don't have all the ingredients to make it
Me: Whaat??
Cashier: (repeat previous statement)
Me: ok, can I get 3 Doritos tacos  
Cashier: We're out of Doritos tacos
Me: Are you kidding?
Cashier: No
Me: Wow, ok. Can I get a chicken burrito grilled and mild sauce?
Cashier: We can do the burrito but we're out of mild sauce

(No need for further dialogue. I wanted to curse & leave, but I was too far in, so I quietly sat in disgust until my order was ready)"}
{"text":"Review is purely because of the cheerfulness of the person working the drive-thru! I've never run across a more chipper person in my life and I laughed for a good ten minutes after I left. 

Kat has to be the happiest person on the planet. She said something on the intercom about it's a Merry day after Christmas at the Bell-- pause -- And then \"well that was fun\" haha I swore I thought she was a recording which is why the pause. She sounds like a commercial. A very happy one. Maybe she is practicing to be a comedian or just having fun. She's hysterical. 

I think we should all learn from Kat and make the best out of wherever crap hole you work. The world would be a happier place. Oh and the food? I felt too guilty ordering bean tostadas at Taco Bell on a non-cheat-day and even guiltier thinking my trainer probably saw my check-in... So I had a bite and tossed it. Sigh. 

And darn it, smart phone ate the pic I took of Kat holding up a packet of sugar. Grrr"}
{"text":"Embarrassed to admit I ate something at Taco Bell as I am a health nut. *BUT* the guys at the drive through window cracked me up and the food I chose was really good. It's very unusual for me to go to Taco Bell especially a second time in less than 3 days. 

The 1st time I ordered I was RAVENOUS and I asked if there was anything healthy vegetarian - Chris the manager recommended the Cantina Veggie Bowl - I got the cilantro sauce and guac on the side. It's really good! (Reminds me of the naked vegetarian burrito from Qdoba) Black beans, some rice, lettuce, corn salsa, pico de gallo and cilantro green sauce. Very tasty. The manager cracked up when he saw my Bears jersey and was talking about Chicago because he is from there too. Very nice guy. 

Came back today for the bowl and it again is quite good - I looked online at the nutritional information and if  you don't eat the guac or cilantro sauce you can cut a lot of those calories and fat. The two guys at the window were friendly until one of em started poking fun at the Bears losing to the Packers. Hmph!"}
{"text":"Had to give star terrible slow service used to be better whennkarla was around not sure why no staff"}
{"text":"super amazing location! food is hot and made fresh! the staff is super friendly and efficient! the manager here is doing a good job on there team continue the good work! i have been to other locations but i recommend this location if your looking for a good taco bell!!! btw the nacho fries are so GOOD ! its a must try while there here......"}
{"text":"i decided to go here for lunch yesterday around 3pm ish and the manager named dwayne who took my order at the register was very rude and rushed me through my order! i ordered my food with no salsa but when i got my food it had salsa in it and i let the manager know and he said that i ordered it liked that! i told him no i didnt you rushed me through my order and didnt pay attention! this manager really needs to be re trained! the food here is terrible i wont be back!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food restaurant I've ever been to. Three cars in front of me and it took 20 minutes to finally get my food. I was only told \"sorry about the wait. \""}
{"text":"Oh taco bell. How can I describe the fake Mexican food you produce? No broken tacos, order was correct, but..  The wait was quite long and the employees.. Seemed to dislike life in general. 'Hi what do you want?' shouldn't be your drive thru greeting and the window at drive thru might need a little grease as it felt like I was getting a door slammed in my face whenever the lady in her taco ivory tower would close it. 

Most likely well stop by again bc its close to home. Maybe next time the person in the taco ivory tower will be a bit happier."}
{"text":"You have to love cheap food that fills you up. Yes, sometimes you feel awful after you eat it, but you get what you paid for!  As far as getting your monies worth, this place does a great job!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!!!!  I ordered a chicken chalupa and received a lettuce chalupa. Must be something new. Lol!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good had Taco Bell for the first time yesterday and it was great love there Doritos tacos their great also there regular tacos it's great also got some chips and cheese for my side highly recommend this boi"}
{"text":"3 minutes to close and told they're done. Drove out of my way to come to this location because they were open until 1am only to be told no because our clocks are different. 3/28 at 12:57am. NOT 1am."}
{"text":"I had to review this taco bell not for the food, but for the dude working the drive through. I'm pretty sure his name is Wayne and he is the friendliest, most upbeat drive through guy I have ever seen in my life. He definitely makes going here easier. I wish everyone loved their job as much as he does!"}
{"text":"Tonight we had a problem with our mobile order not going through. It wasn't in the system at Taco Bell but the charge was pending on my account. After trying to figure out what happened it appeared that the order was somehow voided. It was a problem with the app and wasn't the fault of any of the Taco Bell employees but the manager working still apologized and gave us our food at no charge even after we insisted on paying. She is awesome and everyone there was very accommodating and helpful."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited this location last night after a long day of riding on the motorcycle. We were starving after 10 hours. We pulled up through the drive thru about 10:45pm after switching to the car and we encountered one of the best customer service employees named, Riley. He was funny over the intercom, making our ordering experience enjoyable and then even maintained that great, positive, funny sense of humor when we pulled up to purchase and get our order. Anytime we are looking for some quick late at night we will be stopping back to get those delicious grillers and hope to see Riley again!"}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell.  You've been to one, you've probably been to all of them.  I really don't think I can add anything useful here since, well, it's a large chain place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, are these people idiots? I always go here because this is the closest location to me. I ordered a 5 layer burrito and a Chalupa Supreme. I got a plain taco and a 2 layer burrito?? It wasn't even busy, I don't see how my order is always screwed up somehow every time I come. It's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! Manager Tyson is the worst as A manager how can he even manage a business if he gave me a altitude when I try to fix my messed up order ! Worst service from Tyson ! Last time being a Taco Bell member !!!!but what can I expect from a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time we went here I ordered a cheese quesadilla. It was not included in our bag. Also, one burrito was thrown into our bag out of the wrapper and we had no idea until we got home to find an exploded bag full of gunk.
The next day we went back and I ordered a cheese quesadilla, got home and took a bite full of a chicken quesadilla. 
I don't eat meat and was very upset at this experience.
Point is, they do not listen to the orders. Don't count on getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"I admit I have a sick love of the ground beef taco salad at Taco Bell.  There's something addicting.  However, the taco salad I purchased here was horrible.  The shell was not cooked well, giving it a very raw, bitter taste.  The amount of meat, tomatoes  and lettuce given was quite pathetic.  A could count the amount of chopped tomatoes served on my hand. And the lettuce barely covered the button of the shell. 

Service was pretty quick and customer service was pleasant, but the restaurant seemed to be pretty stingy.  

Can't recommend this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This is the newest Taco Bell on the block, but retains all the staff from the ol' Taco Bell that was down the street. I've know been to this Taco Bell a few times as it is kinda close to home, and it's not bad...

The service here has been great on the few occasions I've visited, which I think is pretty cool. I mean, these places don't pay their guys the best which sometimes leads to not the best service. However, it's great here. Everyone was cool taking my orders, the food came out quick, and there were smiles and \"thank you\"'s all the time. 

The food here was awesome by Taco Bell standards. It was pretty good, the food was hot, and it came out quick. Really, nothing to complain about at all."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and I would like to say the sense the management has changed it has been way better.  The food comes out fast and they seem more happier. When I went in before the crew members seemed like zombies no personality. Mistakes happen of course but overall I enjoy coming to the store more then before"}
{"text":"Need option for zero stars. Excruciatingly slow. Twice in a row, I kid you not, got totally wrong order. Wholly mismanaged. Never again."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst Taco Bell I've been to in a major metropolitan city. The service is atrocious it what's worse is the drive-thru"}
{"text":"This is the only Taco Bell within decent distance of University Circle, so naturally, this location gets super overwhelmed at the drive-through. It's also in East Cleveland, but that never stopped anyone before.

I've seen huge lines for the drive-through, but they get through it in 10 minutes. It's a sight to see.

And the food? It's Taco Bell. It's just fine. I've never had bad food or an order mixup come from here, so it deserves my high marks."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell and pretty on par for what you'd expect from fast food except the fast part. As the closest fast food to the house we come here a couple times a month. If you're coming through the drive thru plan on 10 minutes. Even if you're the only one or ordered ahead using the app. It is just a painfully slow store.

I will say I love the Taco Bell app! Makes reviewing the choices so much easier and group ordering is a breeze.

The interior is clean and I think once we got a taco instead of a taco supreme but in the grand scheme of things that's a minor error."}
{"text":"Let me start off my review by stating the obvious - this is Taco Bell. You have probably formed an opinion on this fast food chain long ago. This review is location specific.

I will also mention I don't eat fast food often, probably once a month if that. I hadn't had Taco Bell in years but had a sudden craving one day at work so I drove over.

The location is in a new building, and it probably took me more time to decide what to order than it did for them to prepare it. It is great when fast food is actually fast! I sat down and ate my food, which was typical Taco Bell fare, except too much sour cream and off center fillings. It didn't take me long to eat but in that time someone came around and wiped down the tables. The lady sweeping the floor even gave me a polite \"have a good day!\" as I left. 

As far as I am concerned this is the best Taco Bell can be - fast, clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"Reviews for your big chain restaurants are almost useless but this is more of a personal review. Exceptional service. I'm very picky with what I do and don't like in my dishes and I've never had them put something on my food that I specifically asked to be off. Other than that, it's your basic Taco Bell. I just simply prefer this one due to the fact that I like my service consistent and they accomplish that. Well done."}
{"text":"Skimpy    All wrap and hardly any filling.  Chicken burrito-  see if you can find the chicken."}
{"text":"Food was above average. Went in for breakfast and left quite suprised. Good job Taco bell XD"}
{"text":"Very inconsistent but I guess you get what you pay for with fast food. Had a horrible burrito from here blekkk."}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food, you can't compare it to a \"real\" restaurant.  However, in comparison to other Taco Bell's, this one has been much better than so many others.

They're quick, and the order is always correct.  The food is exactly what I would expect it to be when I decide to come here.  That's all I can ask for.  If I wanted a sit down meal, I'd go elsewhere, but for drive-thru service, I couldn't ask for anything more.

I would say that 99% of the time, the person I speak with is friendly and smiling.  I find it makes me smile back, and that's always a good thing.

The food is good and takes care of those cravings we sometimes get.  I know what I like here, and as long as I get what I want, I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"Typically this location's amazing. The night crew, especially the young man who is amazing at his job (I want to say his name's Kevin), do a great job at making my visits entertaining.

But every once in a while, I get someone who just seems to go through the motions. I just got back from there and I didn't get a total at the drive thru speaker and had to repeat my order when I got to the window. They were still very friendly, however. And I'm sure you guys are trying to save money, but how are you going to give me 5 sauce packets for 4 items? I always use 2 per item. This wasn't the first time, but I guess enough's enough and I just had to say it. 

Update 12/4:

The quality of service keeps dropping. This time around, not only did they not cut my Mexican pizza into 4's, they didn't give me a fork to eat it with. I'd let that slide, but when I opened up both my hard shell tacos, it was the Doritos cool ranch shell instead of a regular shell. I've been coming to this location for the past 4 years because I live close by and this is the most unsatisfied I've been with my order. On the bright side? I got more than enough sauce."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING. I got it. Don't eat here. Either they don't change gloves, don't wash their hands, use old meat, or some other horrible combination of negligence. Absolutely not okay. Would give negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place makes Chipotle look like Ruth Chris.. Major update needed.. Counters look tired and so do the employees. I walked out last week and won't be back..."}
{"text":"I give this location 2 stars, yet I still visit it. I've been here a handful of times, and most of them has been at night.

When my fiance and I order from here at night, the food is always soggy. It's gross. I usually stay away from the Tacos or anything that involves wrapped in paper when I go at night. In the day time, I guess that's when the good managers are there. The food was never really soggy if we visited for lunch. 

I'm sure I'll go back, but like I said. I just won't order anything wrapped in paper unless it was during the day."}
{"text":"Very nice people, great customer service, could use a little improvement here and there in the store. The location is convenient, they were quick and accurate, overall my experience was much better than other Taco Bells"}
{"text":"Food is typically satisfactory compared to any Taco Bell. Only downside, and it is a major one, is the drive thru. I've been to this location 10-15 times over a couple years and I have never gotten through he drive through in less than 20 minutes. Most of the time there were 3 or less cars in the drive thru line."}
{"text":"This is an ok taco bell. It's much better then the one further up on eastern, but it's not good enough to get me to drive past del taco on a regular basis. The staff is friendly, the food is as good as it gets for taco bell and it's a good alternative to the norm. It is after all fast food and the taste reflects as much."}
{"text":"This is the nearest Taco Bell to the house. It's one of our guilty pleasures on nights we don't feel like cooking. That being said, I don't understand the low rating. Hey, it's Taco Bell, I get it. Fast food. But we've never had a problem at this location and the food is always hot and fresh and the employees are nice. They have free WiFi and the dining room is always clean. We'll come back here again and again."}
{"text":"Great employees here that know what they're doing when it comes to Customer Satisfaction. If you want to taste a good breakfast, rather than any other fast food restaurant, I definitely recommend stopping by here at your local fast food restaurant here at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The second time this has happened...we were shorted 2 soft tacos. And one hard. Yes it was a large order but we paid for it and now don't have it! Frustrating."}
{"text":"Black Beans were old and soggy. Completely forgot to give me my cinnamon twists. And gave me tons of hot sauce all of which were NOT the one I asked for. Paid for extra Black beans, instead got extra disappointed..."}
{"text":"Son asked for some tacos other night.  After waiting in the drive thru for 20 minutes(nothing else around) I get to the speaker and they shut off the lights on the board and said the system was down.    NEVER WILL I RETURN TO THIS DUMP. NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE LEFT!!"}
{"text":"This is not a good Taco Bell to go to. I asked three or four questions. The person taking my drive thru order was very rude answering my questions. Whenever I said, I was ready, she would just say \"hold on\". Not sure why she said this because I was the only one in the drive thru. This was on 6/1/17. 12:35am 
After I ordered she said \"hold on\". Then said, \"ok just leave my drive thru I'm not going to serve you.\" I was like why not? \"Just leave\". So I did. Went to the one on country club and main. The other Taco Bell were very polite and nice. They Helped me and even got me what I wanted that the other one (on brown wouldn't even talk to me about.) Very rude drive thru person is at brown."}
{"text":"The guy in the drive thru on 6/1/17 at 12:40am was very helpful. He answered all my questions and helped me build a taco burrito which is what I wanted. Thank you sir!"}
{"text":"The WORST Taco Bell in Toronto Ive ever been to. I am so glad to be the first person to give them a review. In 2010 I ordered 2 soft beef tacos from them. I ate the first taco without any problems but the second taco smelt off. So, I took it bad and they said its the sauce. Anyway, they made me a new one. That same night I got seriously sick and was hospitalized. I learned the meat was not cooked properly. For 2 years I refrained from eating any Taco Bell. Until 2013 I took a risk and tried it again, but a different location. I'm not going to lie it was so amazing. That same week I gave the Malvern Taco Bell a second chance and I found a strand of hair in it. I was so mad. I've heard many bad things about this Taco Bell location. I'm surprised its still open as we speak. I wouldnt advise anyone to eat from them."}
{"text":"Taco Bell, it is what it is man. But they always deliver! and HEALTH... hey man, you DO get lettuce, tomato, cheese.... they havent found those to cause cancer yet!! TACO BELL.. the only thing worth eating after midnight!"}
{"text":"MOST COURTEOUS STAFF EVER!! 
Congratulations to this owner & team, you guys are doing a fantastic job with training on customer service. 

I"}
{"text":"Pretty much like every other well run Taco Bell I have gone to. If you like one, you will likely this one. All your familiar favorites with pretty good service."}
{"text":"Pretty much like every other Taco Bell. Clean restaurant, familiar food, fast service."}
{"text":"Pretty much like most combined Taco Bell/Pizza Hut locations. 

Fast, efficient service with good and accurate food preparation. You either like their unique spin on food or not. Myself, I am a huge fan!"}
{"text":"I never yelp fast food, but I love this Taco bell. Great customer service, quick and never mess up on orders.

I love Taco bell, it my weight loss food. I lost 70 pounds eating Taco bell. I only ate hard tacos 2 fresco style for 3 months and it worked."}
{"text":"Good food. Great prices. Fast service. Clean. Friendly employees. Reliable free wifi."}
{"text":"This location is usually good but today they forgot my chicken soft taco and when I was about to fill out the survey online, it asked me for the 16 digit code but I realized I was never even given my receipt. I'm very disappointed and I go to this Taco Bell a lot. I shouldn't have to double check that my order was made right especially at the drive thru. If you are low on staff, please hire more people or let the workers know to at least pay better attention to orders."}
{"text":"I usually come to this location to bring my coworkers breakfast on my way to work. Not once have they gotten my order wrong. Kudos to the drive thru staff for making sure orders are correct."}
{"text":"Not such a great experience today. I got the Boss Nacho. I paid for extra meat, cheese, and lettuce because let's face it... TB is stingy on the nachos. I guess I should have got extra pico too because I had like 4 tomatoes. I even had to ask for more meat and cheese. Just terrible. Not so \"Boss!\" Rather disappointing because I love me some TB! That is the only reason I have a 2 for this trip."}
{"text":"The more I try Taco Bell food the more I get Taco Bell regret ;p. I can't fault a chain for the actual food unless it tastes totally different from what it's supposed to be like. Food aside, this location was sparkling clean when we went in and we got our orders in a short amount of time. Hot sauce packets are to the side so you can get as many or as little as you want.

This location is also a bit unique in that it also has Pizza Hut food for purchase. I want to see a taco pizza on the menu so I can order a Pizza Hut taco pizza with a Taco Bell Mexican pizza ;). Chain restaurant fusion-ha!"}
{"text":"We ordered a decent amount of food (Chalupa, crunchwrap, 7 layer burrito, loaded taco burrito) and our total was around $10. It took a little longer than expected to get our food but the cook was apologetic and threw in some free cinnamon twists which were crispy light and sweet. I wish they had thrown in a few more hot sauce packets but that was a minor issue. If you're craving dirt cheap food this might be your place.

3.5/5."}
{"text":"Eh, it's Taco Bell, so expect fast food, chain restaurant Mexican that tastes like the price you paid for it. The staff here are friendly and are good at marking your items so that you don't get the \"extra sour cream\" burrito mixed up with your regular one."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is decent. It is always busy when I go through the drive thru. You normally have to wait in a line that has you in the middle of the parking lot of Costco where cars going straight have to drive around you. That is somewhat annoying. They are pretty slow and always push you to get more when ordering even after saying no. Lucky for them the food is amazing, well at least tastes amazing."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell - nothing special. Food is okay, drive through is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell so if your expecting a detailed review on their menu look elsewhere. It's the same shit they are serving at all the other locations. 
Review is on the customer service.
Super nice and friendly staff that goes above and beyond. I come here occasionally but always drive thru. Is it only me that seems to always get their drive thru order wrong?? This is the only place that has always got it right."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love Taco Bell! This particular one, however, is at the bottom of my list. I've been back a few times, but it's always bad. The order is always wrong, usually due to the person taking the order.  This last time I got sooo sick after being the only one in my family to eat the chicken. This was my only meal of the day and about 5 hours later, I was stuck in the bathroom for 4 hours. I have no doubts it was Taco Bell as I hadn't eaten anything else that day... I won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve any stars. Just went to the drive thru they said \"just a second\" waited 15 minutes and no one ever came back. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"I never understood why people would leave a Yelp review on a fast food joint . That is until today , I stopped in as a last minute decision as my usual coffee place was packed ; I order something to snack on and an iced coffee knowing it would be less than great . However , after being greeted by lauralyn , the coffee suddenly tasted great and my morning was in going in good direction. She was friendly and just had this happy aura about her , even telling some kids in the lobby to have a great day at school and a great weekend . People like her make this chains survive through the constant changes in how conveniently you can get your food ."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We stood up front for a good 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we wanted to order food. Then they proceeded to debate on who would work the drive thru before coming to help us. Our food took forever and made us late back to work."}
{"text":"Truth be told Taco Bell is not my first or second or My third choice of fast food joints to eat. I was running 20 minutes late I was really hungry and I couldn't see a Chick-fil-A insight. 
The Taco Bell by my house does not do breakfast either so this was actually perfect timing and their crunch wrap with bacon is really actually tasty and crunchy and the nacho cheese sauce has a spice to it that's really addicting! 
The hashbrowns are my favorite part and I don't usually eat a lot of starches but this morning I did and I don't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this store at 2330 for food on my way home to Milwaukee. Stopping through the Drive thru I was told I had to come inside to order, DESPITE the DT time open till 2am. Once I got inside, there was no recognition that I was ready to order, I was informed they closed in 20 minutes and it took 8 minutes to be able to ask if I could order, the employee instead was worried more about the donation signs on the wall behind the counter. I ordered and there was no sense of urgency about my order, and I still have an hour and 10 minute drive home, and wasted over 12 minutes trying to get food. Never coming back to this store again."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 times this location is on point with our order. But that 1 out of 5 times.... Is enough to dock two stars. The latest visit we were told to order when ready then told to wait a moment after we heard laughing in the background. We were charged 50 cents for extra cheese for nachos and weren't given it. Nor did we receive the mild sauce we asked for."}
{"text":"It's hard to judge fast food because it's just that -- FAST food. There are always gonna be those bad experiences due to whatever it may be ; the car in front of you in drive thru, random employee having an off day, food actually wasn't completely up to par, but more often than not, we get what we pay for, right? I have yet to experience a bad experience at this drive thru. They've always been friendly and food has filled my Taco Bell craving. Love the grillers, love the fiesta potatoes, love the Mexican pizzas (when in the mood)."}
{"text":"I hardly ever eat fast food, like, ever...  but there are some occasions where my weekend is so busy that there's just no time to cook so I'll grab a 12 pack of tacos at the drive through.  This has happened three times now, and somehow I've always gotten the same guy, Tyler, and HE IS AWESOME!  He helps walk me through the options (cool ranch or nacho?  regular or supreme?  add pico de gallo?) and gets my order taken correctly with no confusion.  His voice is so soothing, he should really be on the radio!  I just adore Tyler, I wish I could hear him more often in my life than just when I need tacos!"}
{"text":"Meal deals  $2.99, cravings deal  $4.99, quesorito box  $4.99. Prices are right, food was good and fast."}
{"text":"Meal deals $2.99. $1 menu items are $1, but $5 boxes are $5.99. Food is good and service is fast."}
{"text":"Love this place. As a vegetarian I order a very specific order, and really hate when places accidentally put meat in my order or mess it up. At Taco Bell, that has only happened once, and I have gone there to eat nearly every day since I started school in early August. 

The food is always really good. I know a lot of people get on Taco Bell's food, but I love it and this is probably the Taco Bell I've seen that does it the best, and I've been to my fair share. 

The employees are always really nice and talkative. When you are there late at night/early in the morning, you see that they have to deal with a lot of belligerent, often drunk, people. As a former fast food worker, specifically one who worked late into the night, I respect them for that. They handle and de-fuse situations correctly. 

Speaking of coming there at crazy hours, one of my favorite things about Taco Bell is the absolute craziness that ensues in there. It's like some kind of convention center; it is amazing how many college students can amass in one taco joint at 2 in the morning. It's probably not the greatest thing to work through, but it makes going to a fast food place an event rather than an endeavor to relieve hunger, and that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"my friend and I were starving and needed something inexpensive yet known to be consistent,  so off to taco bell it was.  What a fricking HUGE mistake! This place was so gross.  I will avoid this taco bell in the future.  No need to say any more about this."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and got food poisoning! Never do I eat taco-bell but the one time I did the steak burrito almost killed me."}
{"text":"This is my local Taco Bell and also my favorite, I know it may not be gourmet or actual Mexican food but it's a guilty pleasure that I can't stay away from.  And this location is always clean and has friendly service and seem to prepare my orders just the way I like it compared to others."}
{"text":"I love me some taco bell, but why isnt there a picture of this delicious little place?  Taco bells are all great... most of the time... and this one is a good little stop and go.  Crunch wrap supremes are heaven with strawberry mango frutista freezes to go along with it.  it equals love."}
{"text":"So you're probably wondering why I'm writing a Yelp review for a Taco Bell. Normally I wouldn't. But here's the situation.

This area has a lot of vacant store fronts, and empty strip malls. But I'm passing through the area, and I'm getting hungry. I see this Taco Bell, and figured I know what I will get for my money--so I stop in.

The attendee took my order--and they are very pleasant and efficient. I went to the restroom. It had a bit of normal wear and tear--but it was clean. I picked up my meal, and the tacos were visually full, and well assembled. It tasted fresh. So why am I writing? I am writing because of what I saw at the condiment table. (See my photo.) 

Normally, fast foods places just grab a handful of hot sauce, ketchup, (whatever) and toss the packets into the bin. But someone here took the time to nicely organize the packets of sauces into the bin. I mean, if the management and staff are sweating a small detail like this, it explains why all of the other details of my visit were on target.

I do not know if I just got them on a good day; but if this is how they operate every day, this store is well managed, and the team is well trained.

Maybe no one else would notice this small detail--but I did, and I want management and team members in this store to know that I noticed."}
{"text":"The tacos were pathetic. There was nothing on them hardly. I'm not happy again. I quit going for years because because of something like this. I thought I would try again."}
{"text":"Usually when you go to a fast food place the customer service sucks and the food ain't that great either. 
I went to Taco Bell tonight and the employee Hunter was super friendly and nice... also our food came out great!"}
{"text":"Clean. safe. the food is always well-prepared. 

although everytime we go they have a new cashier. and there ain't no better way to confuse a new taco bell cashier than to have a vegetarian and vegan walk through the door and order stuff on the menu they didn't even know was on the menu. apparently the cheese quesadilla button is really hard to find."}
{"text":"Taco bell located in food court in Markville Mall.

I've been here many times, this location is good.  Staff there is efficient, they take your order quick and complete the transaction quick.  The wait time is averaging about 2-3mins, which is good, because that means they don't premake the tacos and let it sit there.  The are making it as it is ordered.
I usually take out, and they always ask how many hot sauce i want, and its printed on the receipt. Its always in the take out bag, with napkins. 

Some fast food places skimp out on giving napkins, this place has been good, i never had to ask for napkins for my take out.

Front counter always clean!"}
{"text":"I love this location!!!! I've only gone between M-F 8am-12pm but when I come between these hours I know I will be treated like a customer! I love the customer service everytime I come here the workers are very nice and welcoming I honestly have not been to a fast food chain and got an experience like this. I don't have any hassles at all here! It's so good I had to leave a comment thanks for all your hard work."}
{"text":"Where do I start? We visited this Taco Bell at 1:00 pm on Sunday,  May 13. We walked up to the west door and it was locked,  so we walked around to the north side.  That door was locked,  too.  Another customer saw us and opened the door for us.  We walked to the counter to order and my wife asked the young female employee if they knew the doors were locked,  the employee replied they locked the doors because they \"were too busy\".  Really.  That's a violation of fire code and whomever gave the order to lock the doors should be terminated.  Next,  I have never seen a group of people who didn't seem to care less about their customers as this crew. I realize Taco Bell is not a fine dining establishment,  but I still expect to be thanked for my business. The doors remained locked for the rest of the visit. I don't know who owns this franchise,  but I'd have a serious sit down with the staff,  especially the management. This restaurant is getting one star because Yelp won't let me post with no stars."}
{"text":"Den the manager is awesome, I get a free Nacho bell grande and Mexican pizza next visit since they forgot my pizza and my receipt."}
{"text":"Came in to try the new double chalupa. If you look at the menu, the photo shows the thing full of beef.  It had like no beef in it. What a rip off for 3.69. A soft taco for a dollar would be more filling. I'm done with Taco Bell!  It's a scam"}
{"text":"Don't bother - go to Chipotle down the street instead.

Went to the drive thru and ordered 2 chicken tacos. It's Taco Bell, not rocket science, so I drove off without checking the order I was given. Got home with 2 beef tacos that went straight in the trash. Employees seem friendly but trust that you won't get an accurate order here no matter how fast they greet you."}
{"text":"Had a great drive thru experience today. The girl on the comm was exceptionally courteous and polite. Had a decent line when we pulled up. Heard the car in front order a ton of food but he was nearly paid and pulling out by the time I got to the window! Our food came up very quickly thereafter. The food was all great as well. 

Also the mapped location on here appears to be wrong. The Taco Bell is north of Reagan and it shows south of on here."}
{"text":"The past two trips to this Taco Bell location have been equivalent to a joke. The new employees being trained were most certainly not the issue. It was much rather those that have been there for quite some time. The manager and an employee clearly had tension between them, considering that the lady would be bossing around her manager and arguing that he was in her space. If you're looking for dinner and a show, this is the way to go. However, speedy service is surely not their thing. 

One star for the new employees and one star for actually receiving my food without errors."}
{"text":"My family went in for a cheap and quick lunch. It was a good choice I must say. The customer service is friendly and speedy. Our order was complete in a reasonable amount of time as well. I tried the limited Naked Chicken Chalupa and it was absolutely delicious. You should definitely stop in and try one while you can. This is one of the better Taco Bell's around to say the least."}
{"text":"A++++++ for this Taco Bell. I remember the days when this location could NEVER get my order right, never gave me correct change, was slow, rude, ignorant, didn't speak any English, etc etc etc.

TIMES ARE A CHANGIN'. Starting about a year ago, it's like a light went off - BING! - \"wow, maybe we should aspire to not get brutalized by corporate and the FDA every month!!\"

Once upon I time, I ordered in Spanish... it was the only way I was going to place my order in under ten minutes, and my only hope of it being correct. No more!

They hired people who spoke great English (no, that's not me being racist - I'm just saying it's hard as heck to order through a crackl-y mic with a language barrier!). And, most of them are bilingual and still speak Spanish. They just hired newer people who aren't as accented.

They started actually CLEANING inside, so that when you go in, it's spotless rather than 'try not to look at the floor, otherwise you'll be too grossed out to eat your food and GOD, whatever you do, don't look at the food prep stations if you want to have an appetite.'

They hired \"Wayne\" - a way-too-peppy-for-how-late-it-is drive thru kid (young, blondish, and very nice) to remind you to give them all 7s on their telephone survey (and, hey, I do... because they DESERVE IT). He smiles, says thank you, and reminds you to have a good day. God, I wish I had energy like that guy.

They started paying attention to what you order, and ***SHOCK SHOCK SHOCK*** actually giving it to you!

If I order my burrito supreme without red sauce, IT COMES WITHOUT RED SAUCE (once upon a time this would have made me poo my pants since it would have indicated that I had somehow gone through a portal to an alternate universe)!

Plus, if I order one regular burrito supreme, and one without red sauce, one of the little wrappers says \" -RED\" on it. They label it now - this is unheard of!

Can you tell I like burrito supremes =) ??

So, for all of you South Scottsdale-ites who wrote this place off, veered clear, or drove further to a different Taco Bell in hopes of getting barely less lousy service, TURN AROUND! Go back! Give this place another try.

Check out my reviews - I'm highly critical, and once irritated, I hold a grudge. So, seriously, trust me on this... This Taco Bell has changed.


I'd give it ten stars if I could. Wow, what a turnaround. Kudos to whoever obviously whipped the spot back into shape. You have my business back."}
{"text":"The person who was at the window had a bad attitude.  Guess she not a morning person.  This place should move her to the back where she won't have to deal with customers.  Her name is Alejandra. When I got home my order was wrong.   Not Happy!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is losing my love. Apparently you now have to pay to get a water cup. In Arizona of all places. Now i'm not ignorant, I get that they're covering their costs for the cups. But the one thing I could always count on in Arizona was free water, and that the fast food restaurants gave you a cup for free. Now slowly that's going away."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I've been in the drive through for 15 min now, still 2 cars back.  Last time almost as long. Time before that, lobby was closed.  I will not be back. RIDICULOUS"}
{"text":"This place readily is a piece of shit no soap in resturant .... Can anyone sayHealth code"}
{"text":"Waited way over 20 minutes at the drive-thru and turns out the car in front of us didn't even order where you're supposed to. The worst part is they still let them order at the window and we had to wait even longer. The drive-thru had at least 6 other cars behind us. I swear Taco Bell has gotten worse and worse every time I go. If you want something quick, I would suggest you save your time and go eat elsewhere. They also can't seem to ever get orders right either. It's no wonder why there have been a few locations that have closed down permanently. I'll just stick to better service and food over at Del Taco."}
{"text":"We ordered two crunch wraps and very specifically stated \"NO MEAT, please substitute BEANS instead of meat. We do not eat meat.\" Then, we order two loaded potato grillers with no bacon for, obviously, the exact same reason. 

We get our food and everything has meat in it. Of course, I have to bite into a crunch wrap full of meat in order to figure it out. What a nice start to my afternoon."}
{"text":"Maybe I've just been lucky, but this location always has a really nice guy taking our order and it's NEVER been messed up. We always order everything vegetarian with beans instead of meat and this is the ONLY location that's never \"accidentally\" given us meat in our food. 3 other Taco Bell locations near here and one in Henderson all put meat in our food and ruined our appetite for that day. Kudos to this one for always being speedy and getting our order right!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, I mean it's practically it's own food group to me! This location was pretty nice, it was very clean and all the condiments were stocked. The workers were okay, not super friendly but average. I was a little disappointed because I went during happy hour (medium drinks are $1 from 2-5) and I ordered a small drink. The small is $1.79 and if it hadn't been for my boyfriend notice that it was happy hour, I would've paid more for a smaller size. I know it's only a $.79 but the cashier should have mentioned that it was happy hour. Other than that it was a pretty typical Taco Bell visit. Very affordable for my boyfriend and I, our meals in total were under $20 and I was more than content with the amount of food we got. The food was served quickly and was hot, so I went from hangry to happy real quick! Taco Bell will always be a go to for quick food for me."}
{"text":"okay so I love Taco Bell but today was the worst customer service ever...I go through the drive thru and order my steak cantina bowl...then I'm asked if I would like to donate and I politely say that I already have...well then I hear in the back ground \"she's lying\" how rude...thank goodness I had taken a pic of my donation cause I used a silly name...I get to the window and tell the cashier she's very rude for calling me a liar an show her my pic that I donated...she looked at me and said \"we'll that wasn't here\" seriously does it matter which Taco Bell I donated at? I just smiled said thanks I will just talk to the customer service rep since you obviously don't have good customer service skills an drive off...now I'm hungry an pissed bad combo!!!!"}
{"text":"Really?!? How can you go wrong?? This location is pretty modern & clean. All in all it's a Taco Bell what do you expect. There is a lot of construction around this location which is pretty annoying if your eating in. They've never gotten my order wrong so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I will run for the border before I spend $6 for a taco, nacho, and Pepsi beverage. I remember the days, not so long past when Taco Bell was reasonably priced. It seems that fast food chains such as Taco Bell and Panda Express charge the same as the better local owned restaurant. With my Yelp application practically being a third arm, I am enlightened to local taco shops that are a far better value than Taco Bell. 

  If you are a Taco Bell fan, the service is okay with a capital \"O.\" It is walking distance to the Walmart supercenter and Sam's Club. The crazy drivers will be an obstacle. During school season, high school kids will fill the place up.

  I never say never. But until Taco Bell lowers their prices, for the next 6 months I will only be supporting them through only nachos and cheese or soda purchases. And that is if there is no competition."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I ate inside Taco Bell. After work, I gave it a try.
  The taco and burrito was good on my tastebuds. Ditto with a tropical flavored Mountain Dew, that I have only seen at Taco Bell.
  I was happy with the service. The lady who took my order also brought my food to my table. And for waiting a few minutes, she bestowed me with a complimentary caramel apple empanada. I have been to various fast food places, waiting on an order for an indifferent employee to hand me my order without any acknowledgement. So it is friendly customer service that leaves me with a good opinion of this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't respect this beautiful place that we don't even deserve can promptly learn how to cook their own food. Because there fools take care of the worst kind of demographic and still smile and get the orders correct unlike the one off east southern and McClintock. God bless these beautiful individuals!"}
{"text":"Literally forgot my nachos 7 times in a row every single time didn't care at all worst taco bell I've ever been to in my life. Maybe if they actually read their tickets they could once in their life get a single order correct. I downloaded this app just so I could express how irritated and infuriated I am but this disgusting establishment. Go to the taco bell off Apache and rural they are the greatest on this state. Don't waste your time on this trash southern Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Worst of the chain Taco Bell's. Horrible customer service there's an older lady that always works the drive thru and she has the worst attitude. Plus this place has given me food poising more then once. Taco Bell is amazing but this one is awful. Drive a little farther to another location and get bomb tacos"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit (5-18-18 @ 7:31:59) I had to go back, because an item was left out of the bag. I understand these things happen, especially when a lot of items are ordered and its busy, which was the case. 

I was pretty cool about it, and Robert, the On-Shift Manager at the time made it right and took care of Me until I was satisfied. Of course, I also had my receipt on me. So despite having to drive back, I still gave them a 5 star rating, because the correction was sincerely exceeded. Thanks again Robert, that's one reason why you are in your position. 

You understand the value of your Customers and want our satisfaction."}
{"text":"Took my son here for a snack. He ordered the soft taco supreme and a drink and the young man who took our order was nice enough to change our order from single tacos to a meal and saved us $1. It's the little things that count for me. Nice job young man. My son killed his taco supremes so it must be really good. Service was fast and order was correct."}
{"text":"The Doritos Locos Taco was just so so.  Maybe if I was younger and more impressionable(brainwashable), it might be better."}
{"text":"Look, what do you want me to say?  It's freaking Taco Bell.  Their 88% beef tacos and burritos and mexi-melts and Mexican pizzas are all delightfully consumable.  Just don't go expecting a Chipotle experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell I've been to. The service has always been outstanding and the employees are really genuine"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks, they always get my order wrong, even when I make sure they have it right on the screen. Service is rude and slow, and they always unnecessarily charge me extra by putting my order into the computer in a complicated way. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Drive through time was pretty decent. The food was very well put together. I was given more than enough sauce to cover what I had ordered. Overall it was one of the best taco bells I have been too. I would recommend it to anybody trying to get their taco fix. Btw the quessarito is banging!"}
{"text":"I'm stuck between TWO and THREE stars. After all it is Taco Bell. 

You can usually count on them for cheap and fast food. The cheap part is always standard. But, the fast part for this location has struggled for a while. I mainly visit this location for weekday work time lunch breaks (12 or 1 pm.)

Maybe I should give them some slack because most places are slammed around this same time, but I feel they could step it up a bit and decrease the wait time a little.

Although, I do really have zero complaints on the food. After all it is Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Taco Bell. I don't typically ring any bell to let people know i'm eating here.

Normally this location comes in handy after a late night at work and since I live nearby why not slide in and pick up some true authentic meximerican fast food?

But, they manage to get the job done. There are times the drive thru line is horrendous because they are just slow. So, you park your whip and stroll inside only to find out there are just as slow there too. It's battle - and you fight that battle depending on how much you are craving this deliciousness. How badly are you willing to think outside the bun?

When they are on - they're on When they are off - man are they off.

Live mas?"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is almost always clean, service is good, and the food is what one would expect from Taco Bell. I take my boys here once a week after school."}
{"text":"Ah, Taco Bell.  This location is the closest to our house, yet for some reason it's probably the one we get to the least frequently.  They are also one of the nicer locations around, because it was built from the ground up.

Rather than the old-style mission look, it's a rectangular building, with a modern look on the inside.  It's actually a nice place.  The staff has always been friendly, and service is usually quick as well.  They even have some high stools around some tables that make for convenient quick meals, rather than the typical fast-food style seating.  It's nice and appealing.

Sweet Tea Report: What really sets this location apart is their sweet tea.  I don't know what it is, but this Taco Bell may have some of the best sweet tea out of any restaurant in Charlotte.  Definitely any fast food restaurant, but maybe any restaurant at all.  It's that good.  Unfortunately, you have to hit it right because depending on who makes it, the tea can be good or it can be bad.  Best of luck.

I know, all you haters of Taco Bell are crying about the chicken places that have good sweet tea, but trust me on this one.  Taco Bell - or at least this taco bell - has some dang good sweet tea.  Farmer's BBQ has some good Peach Sweeet Tea, but for regular old sweet tea, I'd put this stuff up against just about anyone (if you get a good batch).

And yes, I reviewed Taco Bell for #550.  How lame is that?"}
{"text":"Sure, it's Taco Bell. And KFC. But you know, there are some times where you just need it. And I walked in and had absolutely no idea what to order. It really had been that long since I had ordered anything at either. Luckily, the lovely cashier/counter person was very friendly and so we talked, which didn't help, because I really still had no idea what to order - but it did allow me to see their Nashville Hot Chicken (or whatever it was actually called) plate.

Now \"plate\" is being a bit generous, as it's a molded piece of plastic - but it wasn't really that bad. The chicken was okay, and the sauce on the chicken wasn't too far off of Nashville Hot Chicken - so for fast food, it was close. The bad part was the biscuit and the corn, which was supposed to be sweet corn souffle or something. I could have just done with the chicken and been just fine. Or just hung out with the counter help - they were actually rather pleasant, which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Okay, you might be asking yourself \"who reviews a Taco Bell? or even looks up reviews for Taco Bell?\" Well, I would ask myself that if I were you, but here we are.

This Taco Bell is awesome. They have really nice and friendly people working for them, and my husband and I would eat inside because we liked the service. We lived a block away, and came every so often over 3.5 years and it was always the same. We appreciate that kind of good service, and it's not one you would expect to get from a fast-food chain."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to his location through the 
drive-thru and the man who took our order was very rude and unprofessional. My mom was not sure what she wanted and he got an attitude and sounded very irritable. To make matters worse we ask for the manager and when he came to the window he never stated his name or introduced himself . He just came to the window and waited for me to tell him what was wrong. He kept saying yep... yep... and then he walked away. He never said I'm sorry he was unprofessional, or I'll talk with him, or is there anything I can do to rectify the situation. He just walked away! Customer service these days is just awful  and we definitely complained to corporate."}
{"text":"Was starving at 12:00a.m. Went here for 2 tacos thats it!!!! And they were soaked!!!!!! With water, like they had been just sitting there! It was terrible! Couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I just stopped by at 1:10am and saw the guy in the window, but he didn't take my order.

The hours claim they are opened until 2am

It seems like the employees are selective or like they prefer to act like they aren't working when customers arrive.

Hope the company knows they are losing customers. 

Horrible service!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by at 1:28 and they were no longer serving.

The website says open until 2am

Misrepresentation !!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible churros. I was told to leave and return with more formal attire (I was wearing an H&M jacket). Great food coupled with Cha Time bubble tea."}
{"text":"Mmmm. I love a good taco on a bell :) this place is so good that once they hand me my food in the drive thru I usually (or 2 times a week) eat it all before I even pull out of the line."}
{"text":"Now that I'm a vegan, there aren't quite as many eating choices for me when I'm on the go.  Fortunately,  Taco Bell has added vegan (no meat, no dairy) options. They call it Fresco style and I've had really tasty tacos and burritos with zero animal products.  I am happy to have this eating option if I'm on the road or just feel like a taco or a burrito."}
{"text":"RUDE A** WORKERS! Went here today w/ my sister n bf, we decided to go in to order & received nothing but rude ass customer service. One worker questioned my sister n the way she was dressed. N to mention it was a 100 degrees outside n she was dressed in shorts n a tank top. Not no booty shorts w/ her ass cheeks hanging out, REGULAR SHORTS. Whether that person was a boy or girl he/she said \"r u trying to look for a husband is that why you coming up in here dressed like that\" WAY TO GREET A F'n customer huh?! Plus the cashier was scrolling on her phone in front of her customers. N the cashier also commented on the amount of food we order \"wow that's a lot\". Never coming back to a place that don't know how to give good customer service."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is our go-to food choice when nothing else will do. Yelp gave me the Duke crown for all the times I've checked in here but I'm at this location so much I know the price of various menu combos tax and all ahead of time. 

Service: Friendly, even when slammed. And they get slammed a lot. I've been stuck in line for 20 minutes in the drive thru more than once because they get busy. While some Yelp people turn up their nose at fast food, the truth is this is what a lot of people eat on the go. It isn't health fare, it's got issues, but when everyone's sick or in a hurry Taco Bell works. 
4 stars because my wallet says I spend a lot of $ here, they've earned the stars."}
{"text":"I have always had good service here.  Food is delivered quick.  I always get bean burritos or Doritos tacos.  They replace beef with shredded chicken no problem.  It's not a fancy Mexican restaurant, but their food is very consistent in taste and quality."}
{"text":"I'm not a Taco Bell fan, in general. But this is one of the best fast food locations of any chain or otherwise that I have EVER been to. The staff here are helpful, friendly, and lively! They are kind and courteous and they get my order right every time, quickly to boot. They take what could be a hum-drum job and they fill it with fun and I always drive away thinking about how glad I am that I gave them my business."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru on planet earth. I could go to giant eagle and buy all the fixings for tacos and then go home and make it in the time it takes to get out with a sack of their tacos. 25 minute wait just to get to the ordering screen. 10 minute wait to get my food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location 0 stars. It is the worst. There's a 98% chance they'll get your order wrong. NOTHING I ordered today was correct. Avoid this location at all costs!!"}
{"text":"I know my boyfriend hates that I love Taco Bell so much (being the evil fast food chain conglomerate that it is), but it's food I grew up with... and I still love it. 

Been going to this location for as long as I remember... sometimes they mess up my order, most times they don't. I imagine turnover is pretty fast here, so it's unfair to judge them on just 1 or 2 visits. For the most part, this Taco Bell has been great. Clean facilities. 

This location also does the 3 free tacos (with the purchase of a large drink) when the Diamondbacks score 6 or more runs. :D"}
{"text":"Well, it's a random late night craving for drive through food. There was 2 cars in front of me, but it moved along quite quickly. I haven't been to Taco Bell for a long time and was not sure what my memory of what to expect taste wise could recall. The lady who took my order was really friendly and very polite. Ordered 4 supreme gorditas, a supreme burrito, and a supreme Chalupa. Came out to almost $19.00 lol. Well, everything fit in one small bag curiously so I had to check my order because I actually was not sure how big these things were supposed to be anyways. All was in there though. Came home, ate it, and was instantly reminded of why I haven't been back in so long. The food just lacks flavor. Added the mild sauce- now it's mildly flavorless. If it was not the fact that I knew I was chewing, I couldn't tell you what I was eating. It really just tasted like nothing. No defining ingredient at all. *sighs* Well, I was surprised of the friendly service in the drive through, but the food was forgettable. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I don't know why I came to eat here. It hasn't gotten any better than the last time I came ten years ago. Taco hell.."}
{"text":"Typically crappy Taco Bell food that's best when drunk or stoned. However what makes this location one of the best in the area is the employees. All of them I've interacted with were cheerful, friendly, and not suicidal unlike most other Taco Bells I've been to. And when the drive-thru attendant is cheery and polite, it makes it easier to choke down Taco Bell's food."}
{"text":"Waited so long in the drive thru 33 mins and counting, I would've left if their weren't more cars behind me. DO NOT COME HERE I never leave reviews but I can hear the employees having a conversation through the speaker, new location and such terrible service I want to drive off but im stuck"}
{"text":"Yep! Taco Bell is my go to fast food restaurant. I just can't resist a chalupa supreme and oh how I prefer them so much more than Del Taco. Usually your to go orders are correct and they never skimp on sauce and napkins. I love that. Hate how other fast food restaurants don't supply those things unless you ask or are stingy with their napkins. 

This location is pretty good. Today they forgot one of our tacos and that was disappointing. Yes, it was only a $1 taco but who doesn't want their order to be correct? Plus the drive thru attendant wasn't very friendly and was a bit weird. He asked to see our ID with the credit card, totally understandable, but then meticulously checked the ID to a point where it felt like he thought we were thieves. Usually a quick check of name on the ID and a photo comparison does the trick but nope he did more than that. Just strange. Didn't help that he didn't use this meticulousness to check our order for correctness. Yeah, I'll probably be back because I love me some Taco Bell but I'll probably double check my order next time around."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. Went there again today, and the same damn thing happened. My food tasting like chemical cleaner. This time I contacted corporate. This location should be shut down."}
{"text":"I know this contradicts other reviews, but this is the only Taco Bell in the valley that seems to get our order right. AND one of the girls that works there is extremely nice!! However, it could use a facelift as it is pretty old.."}
{"text":"I'm not stranger to Taco Bell, and I've eaten at locations all over the U.S. over the years. This one, in particular, consistently fails to get my order correct so I usually go inside as opposed to dealing with the mistakes of the unhappy and often rude, oblivious staff from the driver's seat of my vehicle. Even this proved to be a failed experiment as they screwed it up right in front of me the next time I stopped in. The last time I stopped by to grab a quick lunch to go I found myself standing at the register for over 5 minutes...I was literally ignored by the person working the drive-thru and the employees working the line, both could clearly see me and didn't bother to alert a cashier or a manager. that there was a customer waiting. After a few more minutes expecting someone to simply do their job, I gave up, left, and ate elsewhere. I even wasted another 5 minutes submitting a complaint in the customer feedback section of the company's corporate website, to which I got no response or apology. Pretty much done with Taco Bell as a result of this...if I need cheap tacos, there are far better choices anyway."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have come for breakfast and no one is here to take your order. They are supposed to open at 7 am. It is 7:15 am and not a single person. Kind of annoying really."}
{"text":"This is a nice Taco Bell. The lobby is clean. The drive thru is speedy. The staff is nice. The food is what you expect and they give you what you order, so great accuracy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here and had a nice lunch. The lobby was clean and the employees took our order right away. Our food came out at a reasonable time and our order was accurate. I love Taco Bell because I can eat so much food for so little dinero. I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"This is a Taco Bell, so you know what you are going to get... But I have had trouble on multiple occasions with them getting my order correct thru the drive thru. I would suggest checking your order before driving away. 
The great thing about this location is that if something is wrong with your order, they will make it right and then allow you to keep what they mistakenly gave you.
Inside, staff keeps the dining area clean. The bathrooms are decent. However the staff is not super friendly."}
{"text":"This location is a KFC/Taco Bell combined. It's close to my work so I stop here when I need a quick lunch. The staff are usually friendly but it's easier to go thru the drive thru than step inside. For some reason they are always super slow. They aren't very good anout altering their menu items so beware. Remember to ask for condiments!"}
{"text":"This is a newer Taco Bell. It is decorated in a contemporary style. I had 2 sets of customers ahead of me. The cashier took care of the quickly so the wait wasn't long. I ordered the special or \"Box\". It was a quesadilla box. It came with a Dorito Taco, a regular taco, and a drink. It was just a little over $6. It is a bargain. Both tacos had freshly crunchy shells with a nice portion of meat to cheese and lettuce. The quesadilla was very warm and very tasty. The restaurant was very clean-including the bathroom. It was a great place to grab a quick bite before shopping in the plaza."}
{"text":"Let's be real . . . The food at Taco Bell is not real food. But sometimes you eat here because it's cheap or you are feeling the need for some comfort food. They just remodeled this location so it is cleaner, brighter, and modern. It makes it a little easier to eat here knowing it's fresh and clean. My husband loves the food here. I eat here with him to deposit in his love bucket. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"I think this place should receive Taco Bell of the year award. Talk about an amazing staff! Inside or in the drive thru you're greeted with the most positive, delightful energy! These girls here are incredible! The food is always good, never sloppy. After eating a taco here once I could never return to the del taco around the corner. Instead of tacos that have been vomited up and sat on, these are made with love! (As much love that can be given to fast food) I really hope these ladies get recognized by their manager or company for amazing customer service and awesome attention to detail. It shows! Thank you ladies"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is amazing an Dena deserves some special recognition. The food is very good. Clean restaurant. She is very professional and if you look up the meaning of amazing, you will Dena's picture. Dena for president. Viva la Tack Bell. Gracias."}
{"text":"Yes it's true! It's the slowest Taco Bell in the history of slow Taco Bells. Yes they forget things. Yes the food is skimpy, it's all true! 

But you did it today. The biggest day of the quarter for your company. The release of the new Nacho Fries and you're closed!?!? What the hell? This location needs a lobotomy and I need a new Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, hands down one of my favorite places to eat. This location has a very nice and clean inside dinning area. Unfortunately I know this because I've had to go inside to get my correct order of on more than occasion. Not sure who is running the drive-thru but he needs to cheer the hell up. Hey I get it, you hate your job, you're busy. I get it. However be a human being and deal with it. This location is slow at times but order accuracy is brutal. I got home one night and I got some other persons order, not one thing I ordered was right. I don't know if they a short staffed or new employees but it's a gamble every time. 

1/9/18 Update: things have improved, the bigger guy with his ass hanging out of his pants hasn't been working much. Food has been quick and accurate the last few visits"}

{"text":"Good fresh food, clean store, and got my food fast. The people were nice too. Id just say maybe to the crew to be more inviting and friendly. Everything else was great though."}
{"text":"Just a heads up, this Taco Bell has great customer service; but the food quality and quantity made me rate it 3 stars. I feel if you pay for extra cheese you should at least be able to see it in the food. The (special meat) LOL should be served HOT, not Luke cold. And yes I said it right Luke cold. Over all I may stop to say \"Hi\" but I won't eat."}
{"text":"managed not to mess up order like north hills location does 85% of time... thumbs up"}
{"text":"Went there the other day at 7:45am for breakfast and they said they wouldn't be able to serve me for 10 minutes. I assume somebody got there late. ...thought they were open for breakfast earlier than 8?"}
{"text":"Awful wait time idiot employees. How hard is it to take a simple food order and fill it. Not sure why it's a 20 minute wait time at the drive thru"}
{"text":"These fuckers!!!! I specially asked for De Ablo and mild sauce and we didn't get any fucking sauce! Screw this location. Don't fucking ask me if we want sauces and not give us any you fucking hobbits."}
{"text":"Extremely slow drive thru. Food cold when up to the window. Even though it's cheap I won't be back."}
{"text":"If there was a direct line I would be complaining directly to the cashier working right now Stephen B because he and whomever else is working right now had time to make jokes with me but unable to get me my correct order even when being the only car in the drive thru. Having to triple check my bag is the new thing apparently... came to try the new nacho cheese fries and didn't get any nacho cheese dip. No cinnamon twists either. Offered me tap water when he said there was no more Baja blast though... sweet."}
{"text":"Literally empty in the dining room yet there are four cars parked in premium parking spaces against the building closest to the entrance.

Why do I keep coming to this Taco Bell? It's convenient but that's the only good thing about it. I keep thinking the next time I go, it will be better, but that's never the case. I wish they cooked the chalupa shells longer so they were crispy instead of soggy and limp.

One time I waited in the drive through for 22 minuets. By the time we got to the window to pay I had already gotten out of the car to walk to Jamba Juice and come back while the driver waited in the line of cars.

I called the store on one occasion, after arriving home with my food, to tell them that the Baja Blast I received was just soda water and they had not realized it. Lame.

Please get better. PLEASE"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is also a KFC. It is overrun with teenagers, both customers and employees. We went through the drive through and the person filling our order saw there was a quesadilla in our bag that we did not order, she asked a coworker which order it was for and decided that it was a freebie for us, which would have been great except that we did not get the cookies that we ordered nor the drink that we ordered. In fact, we probably got some poor bloke's quesadilla and now there are two semi-sad customers. I should not be surprised by this because it appears that the employees cannot read or write, just look at this sign. They use quotation marks for emphasis, the capitalization is erratic, they use the wrong \"their\", and the punctuation is abysmal. Please, get better."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell west of the Mississippi... watched an entire ALF episode while waiting in the drive thru"}
{"text":"When fast food is not fast it bites but being in a drive through you can't get out of because of the curbing, this is torture. My clostrafobia is taking over and I'm having a full on panic attack. This is wrong and I hope I don't fully unload when I do finally get to the end of this hostage drive through. Somebody's needs to fix this."}
{"text":"This location is usually pretty good when it comes to service and food quality. 

When I ask for a taco without lettuce I mean NO LETTUCE. This includes the lettuce that gets cross contaminated with the cheese!

The music in the dining room was blaring! I asked them to turn it down and they ignored the request. All of the customers are commenting how they can't even talk to each other! 

I'll be visiting another location next time."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is a great location. Love that it's open late and everyone is friendly. Be sure to check it out if you're in the Dobson Ranch area. Not usually as busy as the surrounding locations and the drive-through has a wide allowance for most any vehicle. Recommended."}
{"text":"I've cooked a turkey faster than this place can make a taco!  27 min for 6 items. It's a miracle this place can muster 2 stars."}
{"text":"Guys! We've finally found it - the slowest drive-thru in Wisconsin!

I've had many a frustrating fast food experience (Culver's after a high school sports game, the In-N-Out Burger next to LAX) but the McKee Taco Bell on a random Wednesday night is incredible. It never takes less than 12 minutes. I always think the last time was just a fluke, and I'm always wrong. Fresh, local food IS big in Madison, but do they really need to wait until I've ordered to go hand-pick the Chalupas? This time they apologized for the wait and gave me some cinnamon twists, so apparently they aren't entirely ignorant of the situation.

One star for missing the fast part of \"fast food\", which is really the most important part. And I guess another one for the small gesture of recognition? I would have appreciated that *before* I gnawed my hand off."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the Taco Bell at 1909 W. Deer Valley for years. Last Thursday night my Dad went through the drive through, we got our usual, they messed up the order and did not give him a mexican pizza and got mine and my Mom's order right. While eating the taco salad, I looked down to find a bug about the size of an ant crawling out of my salad. I promptly stopped eating my salad and told my Mom I was going to call Taco Bell to see if I could get my money back. All the manager said was \"that he could give me another salad (why would I want another salad) and a free drink.\" I said no thank you. I think you should check the rest of your food for bugs.
My advice for people when they go to this place, check your food before you start eating it."}
{"text":"As far as Taco Bells go, this is pretty standard. I recommend sticking to the 'Mexican' entrees, and not going too far into dessert or loco anything. 

With that said, my standard order includes a bean burrito, a nacho cheese chicken chalupa, and - if I'm still hungry - a regular taco supreme. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Got fast service. Hot delicious food and had an overly courteous staff. The store manager was extremely happy and friendly as well. All in all they surpassed my expectations for a Taco Bell restaurant."}
{"text":"After a night of excessive drinking, I can think of no better place to satisfy the dehydrated palate the way a Spicy Double Chalupa does. The only downside would be the casual negative impacts the Doritos Fiery Loco Taco might have on the digestive system. Nothing a good ol Mountain Dew Baha Blast can't fix though!"}
{"text":"Ok...it's Taco Bell...you know what to expect, but this location had great service, a wonderful drink selection (Manzanita Sol!), fresh food...left happy."}
{"text":"Nasty place. Didn't cook food right. Not happy. Make sure your food is cooked. Tried to explain but they weren't hearing it."}
{"text":"Waited 15+ minutes for two burritos at 5pm on a Sunday. There was NO LINE so why the food took so long is beyond me. They are crazy slow. Like blow your mind slow."}
{"text":"This is the nicest, most courteous, most efficient Taco Bell I have ever encountered. The food even tastes better, as if the fryer is adjusted a little more precisely and the line made a tad more effort to put things together just right.

If I give it five stars, unwary readers will expect that the menu has somehow changed to be authentic, and of course, Taco Bell food does not aspire to authenticity in any way. Taco Bell aspires to ranch dip with taquitos, The difference is that when it's done badly, it's depressing; and when it's done well, it has a certain cheerful vulgarity that's easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Wait in drive thru was very long. When I received my burrito the rice was Barely cooked so I ended up throwing the whole burrito away. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a drive-thru joint that doesn't put items I've ordered and paid for in the bag as consistently as this Taco Bell. Looks like I'll be driving an extra 2 miles out of my way to go to the Taco Bell on 3rd St and McDowell from now on. It's worth it to not come home and find I'm missing food I paid for. It happens often enough for the extra 2 mile drive  out of my way to be worth it. Only reason I gave 2 stars is that the staff is always nice while they're screwing up my meals.

Update: 5/13/18:
This place is supposed to open at 7am. It's almost 7:30am and not only is it closed, there's not even an employee"}
{"text":"Every time I got to any Taco Bell the customer service is always great but today despite my many attempts to eat healthy I decided to go to this one on my way to work. The man working the drive thru was amazing he had his own welcoming script as soon as you pull up that was by far the most entertaining thing I have ever heard at a fast food restaurant. He was very friendly and made the hole experience great. I was in and out within five minutes even though there was a line they were fast and kind. Best experience thus far.  Needless to say I am very pleased."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Taco Bell location! There's a man who works the late night shift who is so personable and friendly, and they have the best Dr Pepper I've ever had."}
{"text":"I got home, and my Chalupa's were completely cold! Like, literally cold! I had to heat them up myself. I also asked for double meat in my burrito supreme and my chicken taco, and did not receive either. I go here all the time, and I always have issues. So this time I decided to complain."}
{"text":"I've been going to this taco bell/KFC for more than 7 years, great food and customer service! it closes at 11pm every day"}
{"text":"Went there for a late night bite. The service was quick. However, we ordered a taco and added sour cream. We were charged for the sour cream but it wasn't actually on the taco. That was a little annoying since it was on the receipt and they repeated it back to us correctly. But then it wasn't correct. Usually, they're accurate and quick but today they were just quick."}
{"text":"Employee at drive through was very rude and didn't acknowledge us. If you don't like your job quit."}
{"text":"I love taco bell with all my heart and this location is no exception. I am always thrilled with the service and the food. When things take awhile they always apologize, and once they even threw in a bag of cinnamon twists as an apology. I strongly recommend coming"}
{"text":"This review is 5 stars for one reason and one reason only.  There is an African American woman who works the drive thru and every time I swing through there when I have my moment of fat kid weakness she is ALWAYS smiling, super friendly, super fast, and all the things you would hope for.  If I knew her name I would have put it in but I do not.  If you don't think this is worthy of a 5 star review.... think about all the HORRIBLE drive thru people you've dealt with........ exactly."}
{"text":"This will be the only visit I'll ever make to this restaurant.  If it weren't for my kids' request to eat here they would not have received my business.  We arrived just after 12 to grab lunch and the line was probably 20 people deep.  But it is far food so it should move quick,  right? WRONG!! I waited for our turn,  ordered,  and sat down fully expecting that it would take too long (and it did). While we were waiting in line the girl working the register locked the entrance door to avoid any additional customers coming in.  Some guests would unlock it (either to leave,  let others in,  or prevent a fire hazard) which really perturbed the staff.  Finally our food arrived and by that time (close to 1:00), they had locked all the doors,  printed up signs stating that the lobby was closed,  and blocked them with chairs.  Awful experience,  NEVER again will they get my business.  The things we do for our kids!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to I have gone time and time and time again hoping for different results because I live right across the street I am now forced to drive to the Taco Bell off of Val Vista because their quality is consistent and their portions are nice this Taco Bell constantly skimps on ingredients and gives smaller portions. I have gone every shift and have received the same tight portions each time.  As far as the quality i honestly believe they use differet ingredients. The food even taste worse. The beans taste different."}
{"text":"After a year without Taco Bell in my life I was sad when I realized they removed the enchirito from the menu. The awesome staff and manager took the time to make it for me anyways :) very satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Went to this Taco Bell around 10:50pm and there was two teenagers running the drive thru. The girl did not seem like she was an employee as she was wearing regular clothes and her hair was down and she kept flirting with the male employee. This is a health code violation. I will be reporting this to the health district and to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"They used to be so nice here.
What happened?

Nina on several occasions has had a lot of attitude on the speaker.  
She used to be friendly.  Now she seems like she hates her job and I think is rubbing off on new associates she's training."}
{"text":"I got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich. The price was good and the staff were nice. The place is good to sit and enjoy the meal.

UPDATE (8/3/14): it seems that drive-thro staff are a little different. Since I like the food, I wanted to try something new and asked for it by the number when driving through. I ordered something and the cashier was saying some details about which or what thing I want as the options. But I wasn't familiar and asked her to repeat (and she was talking very fast) and she refused, thinking that I (We) are some kids playing with the mic. 

I asked for the third time, and she said this is not funny (!) and I told her nobody is trying to be funny. So, she called the manager, and he just asked is what we wanted, ignoring what had happened and the food options. The cashier was disrespectful, and the manager was having her back being rude to us.... It was a really bad experience. They didn't put any sauce for us in the bag and no receipt as well. At the window, when she saw us, she said \"I thought you are fooling around\". I am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this. I had a really bad experience with this TACO BELL... maybe if we were Americans, it could not happen... disappointing as we live in 2014...."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service in the very early morning. Thank you for your hospitality and ensuring we were satisfied. This was a lovely treat to dine-in."}
{"text":"You would think with the screens to re-ensure your order is correct it would help. They get my order completely wrong almost every single time."}
{"text":"cheap for a midnight snack"}
{"text":"I know this might be really strange to give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but the staff here were so unbelievably friendly!  I couldn't believe it.  They were very kind and quick with my order.  What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Loved the chalupa but the crunchwrap was just that barely no filling, mostly wrap. Fast and convenient but next time I'll stick with the chalupa only."}
{"text":"Why is everybody complaining? This is hilarious! 
This is Taco hell... 
This is garbage food, how can you be surprised when you eat a bag of ?!
This is not Mexican food at all! This is disgusting!   I suggest you take a few extra dollars and actually try real, fresh authentic Mexican food and you'll be ashamed that you ever walked into a Taco hell let alone stopped to review how nasty your garbage food was !!!"}
{"text":"It's fast food and you know what you get. Having said that, this place has energetic friendly people that are engaging and helpful. Had a crew person cleaning tables ask several times to refill drinks, take trash, how things were. Not expected and appreciated. Good work crew and kudos to managers."}
{"text":"Working odd hours it is hard to find places that are open and offer great, fast service. Using Yelp I was able to find this location and it happened to be 24 hrs!! I pulled in the drive thru. The gentleman that assisted me was very polite. Right off the bat he advised me they could only do cash transactions at the moment which was fine by me. I ordered my food and pulled up. I was handed my drink promptly and had a small conversation while waiting for my food. Great way to distract consumers while waiting for freshly made food! I got my food along with enough napkins and sauce to fix up my meal. I enjoyed my experience throughout the entire process and I normally don't have any care one way or the other when it comes to fast food restaurants. Definitely worth the extra drive time!! Way to go night crew!!"}
{"text":"Love it here clean fast an the manager is very nice been wth the company 28 years I will be back an the nacho cheese fries are amazing"}
{"text":"I went in the middle of the day, maybe three weekends ago.  We all got the $5 meal deal, crunchy version.  I'm not usually a taco person, but I was not disappointed.  Well, the food could have been slightly hotter, because by the time I got to the last taco it had cooled off, but no biggie.
The thing I remember the most is the five flavors (including diet, but not including Code Red) of Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew lovers, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"We rolled into this Taco Bell after 9pm for a little drive-thru after a long afternoon horseback riding. The employee was patient with us after we asked for a few minutes to decide on what we wanted. When we made our way to the window our order came soon after. And the taste of our food was just the same as it is back home.

All in all it was a successful quick dinner run with familiar food. They didn't include any utensils in the bags however, which was sad, I love the sporks."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell/KFC is for some reason always incredibly slow. It's like everybody is constantly always working their first day and doesn't know how to do anything. If you're looking for \"fast\" fast food then do not waste your time here."}
{"text":"Last night my family and I ate here for dinner around 8pm. The food gave each and everyone of us food poisoning. Vomiting, diarrhea etc 
I will never eat at this location again, or any Taco Bell for that matter. 
I'll be in touch with management soon..."}
{"text":"To the Blonde in the drive-thru, you totally made my day. I can't thank you enough for stalling the cops order behind me, because you even saw me cut him off to get in line. My kid was hungry, oops! 

I'm not a fan, but my kid loves the cheese roll ups. I just made a quick stop because it's right by the gym & she was hungry from playing at the kids center for 2 hrs. I typically DO NOT fork out any money for fast food like this, but I needed to get some change & feed my kid. Killed 2 birds with 1 stone. Yay me!

Anyway, if I ever do come, it's only when it's extremely hot and I need to get a freeze slushy drink during happy hour 2-5, just so I can take it home & mix it with some liquor to forget the fact I was just at Taco Bell. 

All in all, the girl at the window was really the main reason I did this review. She was just so helpful!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here it takes FOREVER to get my food! Last time I checked Taco Bell was a fast food restaurant. When I go in I never see anyone working diligently to get orders done, they all move like turtles. It took me 15 minutes to get my food last week! I was very annoyed and was seconds away for asking for my money back and walking out."}
{"text":"So it's a Taco Bell, not a whole lot to say about TB. This one is fairly clean and the food is your standard TB grub. The drive thru is hit or miss though, are you feeling lucky? Because somedays you are in and out, while other days it can take ten or minutes to get through!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience ever! waited 20 minutes in the drive thru to get home and notice my order was incomplete. I was charged for items that were missing. Because this has happened before, I decided to call the restaurant, and this is why I am most frustrated. The man on the phone offered me the options of coming back to the restaurant to get my food (sit in the drive thru for 20 more minutes, no thanks) or picking it up tomorrow. I asked him if he had a manager. without putting the phone on hold he says \"there is someone on the phone FREAKING OUT about an order\" Freaking out I was not, just stated my order was incomplete. I explained to the manager that my food was missing from my bag to which he asked if I left my diaper bag? yes, yes I left my diaper bag...in the drive thru...with my burrito. WTH? The next 5 minutes consisted of the manager saying nothing but \"uhhhhhhhhh\". Kudos to pizza hut for no longer allowing this location to serve their products. My suggestion, corporate should send a maintenance crew to check out the slow gas leak that is killing their employees brain cells. UHHHHHHHH"}
{"text":"If you go here and they actually get your order right, go play the lottery because you're beating the odds."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more dirty locations I have seen. Dirt, grease, grime and trash everywhere you look that requires ANY effort to clean at all. Food under tables, behind booths and on tables. Drink and condiment area were disgusting! Employees are apathetic, look annoyed when you enter and interrupt their texting and just stand there and say nothing. No greeting, no may I help you, welcome to Taco Bell, nothing!"}
{"text":"My past experiences have been pretty much like everyone else's. However, I see a lot of new faces and I believe a renewed effort towards customer service. Keep it up guys, your on the right track!"}
{"text":"3-4 minutes before someone acknowledged I was waiting to order. Ordered at 10:46 got food at 10:54. Fast food? Not here."}
{"text":"OK, I have had my eye critically on this location for some time now. Verdict: MUCH IMPROVED over former staff. Managers on duty are always actually on-duty and working. Cleanliness has gone way up since my last review. Staff is always friendly and customer service is quite a bit above average in my experiences with other locations. They are definitely on the right track. This location could certainly use a renovation, but overall I have been well pleased as of late."}
{"text":"This review is about the great customer service we just received from the female manager (didn't catch her name). My hubby and I had to come back for an order hiccup. We were hangry at this point so we honestly were not the friendliest looking couple. However, she handled our concern in such a friendly and professional way. Smiled the whole time!"}
{"text":"Ugh, nothing quite like hitting the drive thru after a long work day, only to get home and realized they messed up the order. Bummed.

I ordered a mexican pizza, a loaded potato griller, and a drink with no ice. When the drink with ice was handed to me, I politely handed it back and repeated my request. I shouldve known right then my order in the bag was wrong. The mexican pizza had no chopped tomatoes on top, and was soggy. The potato griller, was basically just taco meat and sour cream wrapped in a tortilla...barf. Taco meat doesnt even belong on the potato griller.

Sooo disappointing. So in the trash the whole dinner went. Get it together taco bell."}
{"text":"One of the best Taco Bell's I have been to.  Ultra friendly Carl and staff made my visit a pleasure.  Food came out fast and hot.  Tortillas were soft and tostada shell was crispy!  

Don't know what else you could want out of a Taco Bell.  Clean too!"}
{"text":"Cashier was very friendly & patient with us as we asked a lot of questions about items & were a bit indecisive. Ordered items to go &  our order was correct. I recommend the chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Jill is amazing!!!! Very personable and friendly and that makes a difference in today world where everyone just wants to rush you out. Food is fresh and came out fast. I drive quite a ways just to come here because most Taco Bells are not that great."}
{"text":"I would give no stars. These dumbasses closed the shop early on Saturday. I go through the drive thru and nobody took my order. I pull up and the two workers quickly ran to the back to hide. I hope this place shuts down."}
{"text":"This is for the guys that served me tonight. I had a pretty easy order. Just a cheesy gordita crunch. It was late. Like most places open late, they could've just slapped it together like normal and called it good. Instead they thanked me for the easy order and still took the time and made the best damn cheesy gordita crunch I've ever had. I hope this gets to you two guys. Thanks. It was Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Authentic Mexican food, is what I was looking for & this gem delivered a silver plated of blow your mind tastiest."}
{"text":"I was alone with my 2 year old daughter, and the man at the register made some really disgusting comments. The cashier's name on my receipt is Ricardo H. 
When ordering a taco, he asked if I wanted a hard or soft taco, and when I said hard, he made multiple comments about how I \"like them hard\" every time he talked about a taco. For my drink I said I wanted a large and the same comments were made about how I \"like it big,\" it was when he put in my order, read my order back to me, and when he handed me my order. 
He also asked about my child and whether I had another- I told him that my husband and I did (taking the opportunity to mention my husband) and he asked if I planned on \"making another one\" with my husband. Not asking about a Child, asking about what I needed to do to get one. It was utterly disgusting. Ladies, please beware of the employees at this location."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is going down hill. Very slow in getting your order. The manager doesn't speak to his employees with respect. It's a bummer because it's the only one close to me."}
{"text":"The worst Taco Bell on this planet. The boy taking the order seemed to be high, and couldn't even remember what I said while ordering my food. Then it took 20 minutes for two cars ahead of us to get their food. Finally I got my food, and the entire order was wrong, plus the idiot who took my card walked away while it was processing the information and didn't allow us to leave until he came back. Total shit"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that this location is open again. I don't know what happened they seemed very closed but they are open again. I will review their food another time."}
{"text":"We come here a lot for late night grub. Food is always hot and fresh and the service was killer.

Unfortunately, the food this time was no good. Food was super cold. And after eating the food my wife got sick 30 min later. I had really bad heartburn. Then got sick 2 times in the morning.

I thot it would be a great gesture to call the resturant, and let them know that there food was cold and made us sick. Then GM Fred was very unapologetic. HE asked me \"what do u want me to do.\" I can remake the food again, for u or u can fill out paperwork and I will turn it over to our risk management team. Which means what? BASICALLY. I only complain of something is really bad. Both of us are in the sevice industry(wife) and we know that complaints are supposed to handled differently.

This joker was not sorry about what happend. Maybe this happens a lot or maybe he gets a lot of prank calls idk, the thing that bothers me a lot is that he didn't say I'm sorry or try to reimbursement at all. 

The question is do we go back? Food is good and Jamie they drive thru girl is amazing and always friendly. I might given it another try but Fred man u need some help on how to deal with people. If someone says their sick try to apologize first. Then maybe try to check ur health temps or train staff better
 Instead just fill out paperwork. Lame"}
{"text":"This location used to be a reliable quick stop for lunch. Not so much anymore. Today was the second time I've ordered a burrito that was not only wrong but literally had no meat in it. They just shoved beans and rice in it and drenched it in that baha(?) sauce. I'm guessing whoever made it was hoping I wouldn't notice? They were wrong. This time I ordered a crunchy beefy burrito that literally had no crunch or beef. Who thought it was a good idea to send out a beefy burrito with no freaking beef? At least the cinnamon twists are good."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, and you do not spend a lot of money.  Their quesarito is not as good as Chipotle's, but it is a lot cheaper.  But, I still enjoy it overall."}
{"text":"Asked if they could add ketchup to my breakfast burrito and the manager said they couldn't.. I guess that's too big of a task to handle when I'm the only customer there lol"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a little Taco Bell?  And this location doesn't screw up your order or give you the wrong change back.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"We were craving for Mexican so decided to give it a try. It was OK. Ambiance n food. Liked tacos better. Service is prompt. For Mexican my priority will always b Chipotle."}
{"text":"The food is regular Taco Bell food but the service is phenomenal!!  A friend of mine had a friend visiting from the other side of the world and he wanted to try all the \"American fast food chains\" on his trip. We came across this Taco Bell and we said hey why not. Now how do you give someone the experience of a fast food place?  Especially that of Taco Bell?  The cashier was soo friendly and honestly a genius in her own right!  She suggested we just buy one of everything off the $1 menu and let him try each one. It was a hit. He had such a wide array of food to choose from and a little of everything. We have been using her technique since then to give him the fullest experience we can without breaking the bank. He has loved it!  No matter what that is great customer service!!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING SERVICE!

Extremely clean location with a very friendly and fast staff. Our tacos were perfect and they also had a great music selection. Super convenient location with easy access from Buffalo Drive. Next door to a Chevron was also a plus since I got to refuel as well. Good location overall."}
{"text":"Well I wait For 5 Minutes and Staff was invisible and wasn't Great service Would Not recommend Management Don't seem interested in the Customer need"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place on the planet.  It stinks like rancid grease and the service takes years!  I live down the street and I will usually drive miles out of my way to go to a different Taco Bell.  The service has been horrible here for years."}
{"text":"Why! Why! Why! This is the third time I've ordered supreme tacos with NO sour cream and guess what...PLENTY OF SOUR CREAM on them. I'm too nice for giving them chances. 3 strikes, YOU'RE OUT!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, decent amount of seating, good food. I mean, it's a Taco Bell, it's cheap and fake Mexican food. But of all the Taco Bells I've ever been too, this one is one of the best, I guess."}
{"text":"Worker in drive-through taking my order didn't seem like they were paying attention. When I got to the window, I saw she was messing around on her cell phone. She messed up three different items, so I finally asked her if she was dealing with something more important, to which she replied she was fighting with her girl-friend. Everyone has problems, but general rule,.. employees should not be allowed to use their cell phones while they're on shift!!!! Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I like taco bell I really like what they did with the in inside I'm so glad they opened the dining room finally"}
{"text":"Oh heck no. Never go here. Not even for cheap food. Tacos are all soggy , the Mexican pizzas were soggy and they charged us for extra meat and cheese and they did not give it. Yuck yuck yuck. Yall should be ashamed. Even the Cinnabon bites were cremeless ."}
{"text":"The food sucks but I buy it because I go for the Strawberry fruitista which are SOOOO good.  But this month they blew in 3 times.  Machine broken, out of stawberries, machine frozen up. Guess I have to call before I go to make sure I can get a fruitista."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is amazing. The smothered burrito is the best thing they've ever had and it's only $3 for a beef one! I always get extra chipotle sauce in mine and just one fills me up. 
Their other stuff is great too and the menu is always rotating. This location normally even asks if I want sauce in the drive thru. That's great because a lot of places don't which isn't fun. 
Another awesome thing you'll find at Taco Bell is Mt Dew Baja Blast. It's probably the best Mt Dew out there. The mt dew AM is good too (it's OJ and Mt Dew).
I eat here at least once a week because the food is awesome and cheap."}
{"text":"Terrible service.... Took them 15 minutes to get me 6 regular tacos. Seriously? What happened to FAST food."}
{"text":"This place has a reputation for 45-60 minute waits, but I went mid-afternoon, thinking it couldn't be that bad.  The drive-thru was stacked, and if you enter, you cannot exit until you cycle through the line.  I went in, and was immediately asked for my order.  The boy did not know how to ring regular menu items up (I ordered nothing special).  Then I realized that nearly everyone in the dining room, seated at the tables, was not eating, but waiting on their orders, and it was packed!  I then stood to watch the show that they call their 'line.'  I waited for 20 minutes for three Mexi-melts, and they managed to fill six orders ahead of me in that time.  Two of those six came back because the orders had missing items.  I knew the last one before me was going to be wrong, because the 'cook' burned one of two quesadillas, and threw it in the trash, and sent the order out without a word about the missing quesadilla that he threw out.  The woman came back to tell him she only received one of the two that she ordered.  I watched an old man feign sweeping in the back, so as to avoid having to do anything in the front.  He reminded me of a demented Ronald Reagan with Alzheimer's skimming leaves from a pool.  There was a girl that was stocking the line with wrappers, tortillas, etc., and with every five pound box she heaved up, you would have thought she was heaving sacks at the feed mill.  These two definitely knew how to keep expectations low so that they wouldn't have to jump in to expedite any orders.  Two of the boys on the line had to ask the third boy that burned the quesadilla how to prepare nearly every item.  They seriously have staffing problems that ruin this place.  It is a mystery as to why it always so busy.
After finally receiving my orders, the Mexi-melts were made with about triple the portions they should have received.  They were oozing messes and did not taste right, because the proportions were incorrect.  But part of the puzzle did fall into place:  if they are using 3x as many ingredients as called for, it's not wonder they run out of food so fast, and then take so long to recover their inventory in order to fill the new orders."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 starts because the food was yummy and service was awesome. I like how they where on top of everything except the fountain drink station there was soda all over it I could not put my drink down to put a lid on it. I did notice they did a good job making everything else was clean even the bathrooms."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell! It's as bad/good as every other Taco Bell. How the F can high-end steak houses get 3 stars because people complain that, \"it's too expensive\", yet the same person gives taco F-ing bell 4 stars?! High end steak houses are supposed to be expensive! The worst steak you'll ever get at Peter Luger's will still take a giant dump on your best Taco Bell meal. F!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to.  Consistently under staffed to the point of the person behind the counter telling customers it's going to be a 30 minute wait for 2 tacos.  Give me a break.  They should be shit down to save the reputation of taco bells everywhere."}
{"text":"cant get a simple order right and they act as if your in the wrong when you ask them to fix it"}
{"text":"Pulled through order was $10.01. gave the goon $11 & didn't give me change. When I told another employee, hoping to get my change back she smiled and asked me if I wanted it?? Duhh goon"}
{"text":"I always come to this Taco Bell and have had great service in the past. My order looked right on the screen. The girl on the intercom seemed nice. But it wasn't until I received my food is where I really felt like it was a waste of time and money. I really should have gone to jack in the box across the street. Like I get that it's fast food but common.
I ordered two cheesy bean and rice burritos and it seems like they didn't get the rice part cause it was all beans. And I love your guys rice. Next time I'll be sure to ask for only cheese and rice. The nachos bell grande were horrible. The cheesy potatoes weren't the same, it didn't taste like they usually do. Like they were sitting out all day and they just topped it with cheese and sour cream. And what made me upset was after eating all of that with my brother I opened my Doritos locos taco supreme to find out it wasn't even supreme?!?!?! It's gonna be a long time before I come back to this Taco Bell. If that's the case I'll go to another one 15 minutes away. And finally your diablo sauce taste like ramen. It was just all bad. Service seemed fine until I opened up my food.
Giving 2 stars today, service was nice but the food just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"35 minutes for a drive through order. are you kidding me?! should have gone to filly b's. ?

seriously, get your shit together. your late night crew is garbage. ???

are you fucking kidding me?! not taking orders ten minutes before you close?! fuck this place. ?????"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent food. However it takes forever for them to make your food and the restaurant itself looks a bit trashy."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't rant on yelp about a fast food joint but this is by far a joke. I ordered the triple double crunch wrap box. I get it every time I go to Taco Bell. It is usually loaded up with ingredients. This time there was nothing in it.. literally. There was mainly lettuce and tomato, virtually no meat, cheese sauce or sour cream. And I didn't even come last minute. I came at 11pm and google says they are open till 2am.. idk if they are doing horrible on food cost and decided to skimp as much as possible or what. Every time I have came to this location they have either messed up the order or the food is cold. Don't recommend coming to this location. I work in the food and beverage industry as well so normally I wouldn't go about it this way but this is absolutely a waste of money."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Cold food both times. Usually just get desserts like Cinnabon Delights.  They were not warm and soft like they usually are when purchased at other locations. These were so cold they were starting to get hard. Same with the Carmel Apple empanadas--cold. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"They are supper fast and really friendly here. Its fast food, but its hard to get good service."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is super close to my house and job so I usually come here. Never again. I waited 15 minutes in the drive thru after ordering from the mobile app. I had to ask if I should pull forward after I let them know that I ordered thru the app, the employee never said anything more than ok. When I finally got my food and got home I found that part of my order, that I paid for, was missing. Tried calling the store several times, no one ever answered. Guess I'm out that money for items I never received. Avoid this location of possible. I'll be going to the one on Union Hills and 91st from now on."}
{"text":"I will say that this location  has seemed to have improved over the past months. It is still sort of hit or miss. The remodel has left the drive through very small and awkward for a normal sized car much less a truck or suv. But the food quality is great for being taco bell. The correctness of orders is fantastic which is a big issue with any taco bell."}
{"text":"Pretty sad that When Taco Bell give you crappy service condisering the very low expectations most people have to begin with. 
Ordered an 12pk. Soft tacos for a 3 yr old and a 5 yr old. They were so sloppily made that they were ineatable. Half the fillings were outside the tacos, most of the tortillas were broken or ripped or folded over. It honastly looked like someone took the tacos and locked them around store before putting them in the box. I did not get the nacho cheese cup with the chicken nugget things. My power bowl was 85.% beans, and I didn't get the cinnamon twists I ordered, they were never rung up. Basically the vast majority of my order was poorly made and or incorrect. Also I got to hear a conversation between an employee and Desirae at the drive through about how one of the pop machines was not out of syrup, the carbonation was just blocked, \"probubly just with some mold\"  great conversion to have with a customer in  earshot. I don't think I will be returning to this store, not for moldy. Pop and beat beat up food."}
{"text":"Had an extremely poor customer service experience  with Malia. First she forgot my drink I asked her for it and she ignored me. Then I had to drive back through because she forgot my chips. She didn't order a large drink like I asked and then argued and said I didn't order it correctly.
She needs to be retrained & an attitude adjustment"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, but this location needs an upgrade!

Please take note that this review is based on my experience when I lived in Vegas a year ago. As far as food is concerned, it is your normal Taco Bell food. I usually get the bean and cheese burrito, Beefy 5 layer, or the cheese quesadilla. Nothing special about them, but they are a quick meal when I don't have the time to have a sit-down meal. 

My problem with this location is the staff. No one seems to know what to do here and the lady that always took orders would be taking my order and then start talking to someone else in the middle of taking my order!! She did this every single time I came into this location. Took her two or three times longer to take order just cause she'd stop and make conversation with someone else. 

Then you have the person at the drive-thru window that would also be talking to someone else while taking your order as well. Many times I'd be confused as to who they were talking to! Not only was that a problem, but it took them forever to make your food. Drive-thru always was packed with people and the line moved very slowly. 

Needless to say, I still came back time after time just cause I like Taco Bell and this location was close to me."}
{"text":"I come here often as I just live within walking distance from this location. 

Food and prices are typical for Taco Bell. I just usually get my usual which is the beefy 5-layers and the cheese quesadilla. Both are always made the same, which is what I like. I like going to a place and getting what I'm used to. Some locations I've been to are really skimpy on the meat or cheese. The food here is consistent. 

Staff are always super nice and accommodating with any special requests that I may have. They are super quick at getting orders out to their customers as well. 

Every time I've been in here, their place is clean and organized as well as well stocked with all the condiments and drinks. Tables are cleaned off and floor swept. A great place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is the only taco bell I've ever been to where the food is ALWAYS hot. They seem to be understaffed a lot, but everyone is still friendly & pleasant. I waited a long time in the drive through & they apologized & gave me a free taco for making me wait so long. Usually when places are short staffed they cook tons of food in advance to catch up so you get cold old food. Here, they may not be fast, but the food is fresh & I'd rather wait an extra 5-10 minutes for food that isn't rock hard."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would, was the first customer in line at 9:25am and ordered my food like normal. Say in the drive through for 15 minutes after opening waiting for my food. I had to get out of the car to tap on the window for them to open it. They are lucky they took payment before my wait time I would have taken off. If your going to open at 9:30 and not earlier, I would suggest having meals prepared and ready for customer to show up, not just turn the lights on at 9:29"}
{"text":"Horrible...if you want to eat lunch then constantly go to the bathroom eat here I've been to a lot of Taco Bells this one gave me the runs within 20 minutes of having it I know it's fast food but WTF man something is very wrong if I can eat at other Taco Bell locations and not have this problem please fix this only positive here is they renovated this location so it looks nicer inside than others"}
{"text":"There's not much that I can add for this Taco Bell. It's your standard fare for fast food. It's a bit slow as they are making food as it's getting ordered. That is a good thing, I guess. Well worth the wait to get hot food. I am a bit surprised at their extended menu. And their choices for breakfast items. I may have to check them out during breakfast (before 11am). I'm curious about their breakfast tacos. I like their $5 meal deal. LOTS of food for one person. We usually get that deal and 1 other item and share the works."}
{"text":"On 11,10,2016 We walked into the most dirty, unclean restaurant  ever .The bathroom was filthy , and the restaurant tables were very dirty.Makes you wonder what the kitchen is like.   O,rating on this dirty Taco"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell. What can I say that may be anything new for you. At least they are consistently ok. We hit the drive-thru this time and so we never went inside for a peek. This is a newer location and the building is pretty new and nice. The drive-thru had one car ahead of us so we received our food in a fair amount of time (not as fast as I've experienced before). Sometimes when you get your food a little too quickly, it makes you think that they did not make your food to order and that it may not be that fresh and tasty. So, I wasn't too shaken by a little delay at the window.  They get a 3 because of the prepared food. For example, the meat with the texture of mush, not a lot of fresh veggies in the items and the saltiness of the chips in my nachos."}
{"text":"It's taco Bell.
It is clean at least.
Drive thru is fast.
There is happy hour for the freezes and the breakfast burritos are cheap"}
{"text":"Service is always slow and usually not very nice...the food, well it's Taco bell so it's good.."}
{"text":"We went to this Taco Bell after the game and were VERY pleased with our experience. The guy working the drive thru window was sooo patient with our ridiculous drunk orders. He was so nice to us. We will always remember this Taco Bell and we hope to see the nice guy at the window every time.

Oh, and the food was fine."}
{"text":"I asked for specifically, ten mild sauces because I get my tacos without meat. Sadly after I stressed this, they did not give me the amount I asked for. Tiss tiss Taco Bell employee."}
{"text":"The line for the drive thru is always long at night, but it moves fairly quickly. I asked for a specific amount of mild sauce and the lady came through. Well done."}
{"text":"The food is typical Taco Bell which I like.  The main issue I have had here is the service.  The people who work there are nice but they have messed my order up at more than half the times I have been there.  They fix the mistakes with a smile but having to go back in gets annoying."}
{"text":"I ordered a taco supreme from the Taco Bell on Lee rd and this is what I got, no sour cream no tomatoes hardly any meat . The burrito was tortilla, a little lettuce, cheese  and a teaspoon of meat.  Great customer service and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Taste was good like always. Staff was amazingly polite but for some reason there was like barely any meet in my double xl challupa box... All that is going thru my mind is that I just spent over 6 bucks and I'm still hungry... I will stick with del taco down the street to get my satisfaction when craving tacos... Plus the taco shells fell apart way too easily... It felt cheap... two stars ... And both are for the staff because it's not their fault..."}
{"text":"I have never been more disgusted and irritated with a fat food restaurant. Every single time I have ever ordered food in the drive thru at this location, food has been missed. I've come home to discover missed food multiple times. When I think about it, I check it in the line and sure enough- something missed every time. I've never seen a worst run fast food in my life."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would - just tried to go through the drive through at this location and the sign was dark. The worker asked if she could help us and my fiancé asked for a minute since he couldn't see the sign. The worker replied \"have you been here before?\" We said yes. She said \"well I think you can handle it then.\" Needless to say we pulled out of the drive through without spending a dime at this establishment."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. It is THAT bad. Went through the drive through and got home about 5 minutes later to almost frozen food. Went back for a refund and it took me almost 20 minutes just to get help - meanwhile the cashier is too busy fighting with the other employees to even care about the line of people waiting. As I'm waiting, I see one employee reaching into the chicken warmer with NO GLOVES, his hand grazing one of the pieces. Gag. Finally, the cashier came up, didn't even say a word, and when I let her know about my situation, she walked away and the manager came up. Young guy, quite an attitude.. throwing the food around and making a mess. He didn't give me a hard time about the refund though. I left with my money and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"It takes so long to get your food. My mother and I got food poisoning from this location"}
{"text":"Always out of stuff like cheese and tomatoes.  Staff is S L O W to serve.  Orders wrong more than once.  Eat at your own peril!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, typical Taco Bell.  Employees are nice and friendly at this location."}
{"text":"Looks like the other reviews speak for themselves.  23 minutes to get a simple order.  Manager told kid she was on break when she knew he had no idea what he was doing.  21 minutes to make 3 tacos and a burrito?  This is the third time I have received very poor service and food at this location.  Always seems to be in the evening too.  Wonder when the General Manager and District Manager will open their eyes and get this location clean up.  Very poor service.  If you don't care about this location then shut it down.  Stop giving your customers poor service and food."}
{"text":"Seriously?

It's fast food, it's simple food and it's still as inconsistently screwed up as possible every time I've tried this location. 

Hard shells were beyond stale, I'm not sure how you even manage this when you guys would be going through so many, leaving them out ? 

Ordered chicken... My whole order was chicken..as confirmed on the order screen when I ordered and as it states on my receipt. Did I receive one product with chicken? No.

I don't do fast food often, but I do like to indulge here and there, sadly the taste was so bad I literally can't imagine ever going back, not just this location but any toco bell ever. You killed my taste buds.

Hire managers that actually manage."}
{"text":"It's just Taco Bell nothing to get happy about...it's cheap an fast...the only thing I hope for every time I come is that they get my order right. 

It really truly is a hot or miss at this location...I guess it depends on who works late here. For example: Sometimes I'll get the person who doesn't sound like they want to work there but they always get my order right...and other days I'll get the person with an amazing personality but can never seem to get a #6 right to save their life. So yes hit or miss

Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm gonna quit going there...whenever I'm in the mood for something quick fast and in a hurry Taco Bell is always my go to spot...but it's only because I love the Fire taco sauce...

The sauce packages really make me happy"}
{"text":"Yeah, that's right, a 5 star rating for Taco Bell, why, and based on what you ask?

First off, my rating is in comparison to other fast food joints with similar offerings.  Second, I am comparing other Taco Bells that I have been to.  Last thing that affected my rating is it's quality and consistency.

Routinely, I stop at this Taco Bell each time I hit Mentor for the mall or Pier 1.  Now that probably equates to 12 or so times where each time I received my food as ordered, not messy, hot, and delicious.  I also like the layout and speed of service.  I live in Richmond Heights and the TB on Euclid is inconsistent on just about every order.  I stopped going there for lunch because of this. 

Could you imagine life without a Taco Bell??  I couldn't, so lets cherish the good ones while they exist.  My usual order consists of a bean burrito, chili cheese burrito, and a beef meximelt."}
{"text":"Review for Taco Bell and this location only!!

So this is the closest TB I have to my work and I am very happy that it is there but just wish the people working there gave 2 sh!ts about your food.  Don't get me wrong, I still go there once every couple weeks and I would be quite bummed out if this one closed, but just wish the quality would improve.  They never have napkins, all the sauces, and the tables aren't wiped down enough.  I believe they recently hired a new manager so lets hope he gets these kids into top form.  It still takes care of the craving though so I can't knock it for that."}
{"text":"Generally, I love Taco Bell. I remember growing up and eating Taco Bell at least once a week. However, over the years I find myself going less and less and this particular Taco Bell is it good example of why that is. 

Upon my arrival to the drive-thru I find myself with a 6 minute wait time at the drive through and that was while I was at the speaker to place my order. Notcwaitingvin line which ould be understandable.

While giving my order I found that they had a hard time getting my order correct. When I finally got up to the window I asked them again to read off my order. And the lady did and it was correct when she red it off.

However, by the time I reached my house opened up my bags looked underneath my large order in the two bags,  I found I was missing some items.

So, knowing my food would end up being soggy, with my hard shell tacos becoming soft shell tacos, I made my way back to the Taco Bell while I left my very hungry family to eat at home.

Upon arriving back at Taco Bell I walked in this time. I noticed something I didn't notice prior.  the woman who had taken my order connected to your cell phone. This would explain why I had such difficulty in placing my order and getting it correctly it also would explain why I didn't get everything I ordered. Because they were busy listening to whatever was playing out of their ear peace.

Now I don't blame her, management apparently was allowing this. 

Anyway - when I walked up to them they new they forgot it and got me the items they forgot.

I miss the good old days."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell/KFC is the worst! They never seem to get the order right and they always let you drive away from the drive thru without even asking if you want any sauce. It's maddening."}
{"text":"Ordered using the app. When I arrived, things started off by being told that they don't sell black bean burritos after 11pm. They refused to give me a refund because I paid on the app. So I got something I didn't want instead. I told the girl at the drive thru, Diablo sauce. Shockingly I didn't get any sauce. I also didn't receive one of the burritos that I ordered. Food was pretty good. Should be noted there were about 4 cars in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Ok, I had to calm down before I write this. There's a reason why I don't come here. I wish they could have gotten my order right. I ordered they repeated back to me. I checked my bag and low in behold, my order is wrong. 

My order was not properly sealed so I had sour cream and tomatoes in my bag. Most of my food was in the bag instead of together in my tacos. I guess the manager was taken my order. $26 I paid, that's it no more. I'll visit Del tacos or another place. 

The positive was the store was clean. Staff was somewhat friendly. They did greet me upon me walking in. It's going to be a while until I go back."}
{"text":"I have tried using this taco bell several times to pick up food for my office. Every time, something ends up missing from the order and the drive-thru staff is never friendly. Very poor customer service all around. Will only use the 24th St and Indian School location going forward."}
{"text":"no judgement when I cram 20 mild sauces into my purse like an Tbell addict."}
{"text":"Seriously, if all your employees were like Kyle-Vincent I would come here every day. Polite, helpful and customer oriented and a killer smile. Oh yeah, the food is good and the place was clean too. But really awesome service thanks for being you. I hope your manager reads these reviews."}
{"text":"I've been to this taco Bell twice through the drive thru and both times I sat waiting for 10 mins before I even got to the area where you place your order as they take forever! Once you place your order it takes another 10 mins to get your food!  Thought the first time it happened was just a fluke,  but seems like the staff is high on something because of their demeanor. .. Very slow and \"heavy eyed\" never going to this location again."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for fast food, but this place was clean and the staff was pleasant.  The food, well it was Taco Bell would you expect anything different, it was good"}
{"text":"Ciarra (not sure if i spelled it right) is amazing.   Im not sure how she manages to seem so genuinely friendly. I worked fast food for 10 years so i know what its like to be behind the counter (its HARD work) she seems young, so i really hope the fast food life and mean customers dont get bring her down and kill that bubbly spirit! Anyway, food always tastes fresh and the service is amazing. Btw the mini breakfast bowls are yummy! Tiny but yummy! Also i love their coffee lol"}
{"text":"It has been 6 months or so since I've been to a Taco Bell.  Now I remember why.  This one was particularly bad.  I got a 1/2-lb. beef combo burrito, nacho cheese gordita, and a large soda.  
The name \"beef\" combo burrito is a misnomer; this thing had 1/4-lb. of sour cream in it, and the rest was refried beans.  There couldn't have been more than 5 little granules of ground beef in this crappy thing.

My order was $7.07 for two items and a soda.  I used to go to Taco Bell in California and get the same order for about $5.00.  I don't know what is going on at this place, but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The service is very slow. It took almost 10 minutes to order when you walk into the restaurant and 15+ minutes from the drive thru. They seem to always  be under staffed and running a skeleton crew in the afternoon and evenings."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Taco Bell in America!! Cold burrito, hard chalupas, old petrified potatoes. I get desperate at 10:30 pm and go back but not anymore!! I love the location but hate everything else about it. That goes for the unprofessional employees too."}
{"text":"Always go here when I need to get my Taco Bell craving satisfied.  They always deliver, and Taco Bell is always a much needed change from the normal fast food that is burgers and fries.  They are a bit slow when it comes to getting your food, but I guess you cannot complain because you know that everything you order is being prepared right on the spot.  

Yo quiero Taco Bell.."}
{"text":"Through the duration of my entire meal I had to listen to loud obnoxious kids hanging out at the front counter. Management on staff?

Food was good. Experience not so much."}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest Taco Bell I have ever been to. I love Taco Bell and come here like twice a week. All the employees are very friendly. My only complaint is that their Mountain Dew Baja blast freeze machine never works and that is my favorite drink. Also, there is an employee (named Jose) that always tells people to have a blessed day. It's ok for him to be religious but he doesn't have to implement it onto other people. Overall this Taco Bell is great."}
{"text":"Walk in Mexican music playing loudly. The place is a mess. Nothing cleaned. Nothing stocked. Crap all over floors."}
{"text":"i  visited this taco   bell on may 25  2018.   the   drive thru  ordering         macine    was    horrible,   i   am  hearing  impaired and was not able to hear the taco bell worker at all.   i  drove around to the window, and after an interminable wait  told the   person on the drive thru window  i  could  not hear        the person when i  tried to order,so i  wanted to order at the window  and was told  very  rudely\" you can't order   at this window'  when i asked why,the  person stated 'because we are not allowed to  take orders   here'!    most other   fast food    will     kindly take   your order   when you  mention hearing impaired.  this place was  rude .     i  just drove off.  i won't be  back there."}

i also like their frozen lemonade-based refreshing drinks..."}
{"text":"Great experience today. This T Bell used to be dingy and I haven't been here in years. It was really nice today. The speakerphone was clear and the service given with a happy attitude. The food was fresh and crunchy. Mmmm, love those nacho cheese Doritos tacos.  I will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION. VISIT ANY OTHER LOCATION. 

I've been to this location 10+ times, but NO MORE. The WORST cashier you can have at any business, \"NOEMI M.\" 

I'll be the nice one here and simply say she's extremely rude. When you interact with this cashier, you will want to up and leave and take your hard earned money else where. 

Speculation, but here demeanor was \"I don't want to be here, I'm too good for this job.\" 

This location manager should consider giving a HUGE pep talk. 0% customer service skills."}
{"text":"I work down the street and run here for food when I don't bring food, I've gone thru the drive thru several times and never had a problem with waiting. My order is always correct, they've even ran after my car when I forgot my soda, the staff is always friendly. You guys make it an easy decision for a quick meal. 2 thumbs up ! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Missing food- hard tacos with absolutely no filling- drink with just carbonation no flavor. Just overall bad service."}
{"text":"When will yelp allow \"zero\" stars? I'm pretty sure that explains its self. Never again is what ill do."}
{"text":"With fast food, I only review it based on the service. 

Everyone knows Taco Bell is delicious and you're lying if you say you don't think that.

Glad we cleared that up. 

This Taco Bell is par for the course in regards to food. However, they shine in regards to customer service. Below is a dialogue of typical fast food businesses in a drive-thru setting:

Me: [pulls up to order] Hi!
Fast Food Restaurant: Hi, what would you like?

And now this Taco Bell:

Me: [pulls up to order} Hi!
Taco Bell: Hi! How is your day going?

This three extra seconds they spend is so freakin' polite, I can't even. If you're craving a Mexican pizza, go to this location where they charm the heck outta ya."}
{"text":"First of all... the 5 star review is for this location and staff only. 

All you people that were dissatisfied with the way your food tasted were going into the food experience at TacoBell with way too high of expectations to begin with. It's fast food, hello! It's not gonna be awesome. I mean you are paying less than a buck for some of the stuff on the menu. I doubt anyone goes here unless they are broke, in a hurry or drunk. 

I have to give this location props tho, they are super nice and friendly. Always a \"Hello, welcome, how is your day going?\" when I pull up to the drive through. Big smiles when I get to the window. Then the topper, \"Have a great day, come back and see us soon!\" I mean seriously, they are great! I am usually there once a week, usually after a long day and they always seem to perk me up. 

After the less than two words spoken and sour faces I get at Wendy's this place is awesome. Seriously, go compare the two places and tell me I am not spot on. 

Happy Belling! :-)"}
{"text":"I went throught the drive up window. The women who took the order was very rude and when we got to the window i paid and she handed me my 2 large sodas. She gave the first one to me fine. And the second one she let go and it fell and spilled all in my car. Not to mention we had to ask her for hot sauce. Every time I go there, she acts like she is in such a rush and is so rude. There were no cars at all in the drive up. So what's what rush? I will never go through the drive up again. And who knows i probably wont come to this location anymore. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I went to this Taco Bell today and it took 15 minutes to order the food at the drive thru and honestly im not sure whether to blame the employee or the headsets Taco Bell provides for their drive thru. I told the lady 3 times I wanted a brisk half and half as my drink and I still got the wrong drink. This was around 1:30. She even forgot to give me my drinks until I reminded her. It was just terrible service over all. And the chips for the nachos were stale."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell on planet earth! Sat in drive-thru line for 40mins! And they have one of those stupid barriers so you can't even get out of the line. Literally trapped and stuck waiting. Every time, never fails. Go to another Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Well I passed a Fausto's and Roberto's to get here due to a certain loved one preferring the burrito supreme here. 

A. Clean and bright well kept and calm!

B. Service is darn good. 

C. Food comes out quickly. Not sure what that means?  

D. Clientele seems not too rowdy. 

E. Uneventful this is a Taco Bell. Even the hot sauce us not too hot or fiery!  

Not bad."}
{"text":"Update! I went again today and made another large order, and they didn't mess up a single thing. Good job to the new crew there. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Horrible food, got the Pizza Hut Pepperoni and you can tell it's been siting in the oven all day! I just took 4$ and threw it away oh well I won't be back"}
{"text":"I had to write a review about this because it's hilarious to me that some wrote a review and gave the service a good note but the food a bad one.  Ha Ha!  It's Taco Bell.  It should only be consumed when you're drunk, hungover, or just want to punish yourself!  Don't get me wrong, I love it, but's horrible for you.  I feel like if you go to Taco Bell you know this.  Just me?"}
{"text":"I am almost embarrassed to write a review about Taco Bell but this Taco Bell is always SOOO slow!  I went today and the did not have chicken.  I went a few months ago and the actual store was closed and drive thru was only open because they did not have enough staff.

I had to laugh because today, when we went through the drive thru, the guy told us we could start our order, so we did.  After the first item, he said \"hold on, I was doing something.\"  Well, yeah...that is kind of the nature of the job, right?  I usually give people the benefit of the doubt but it was pretty bad.

I do have to say that the food generally looks neater than other TBs, if you do get the correct food or the food at all."}
{"text":"I expected the usual fast food service,  but I was impressed. First off they were very polite, our order took awhile for it being fast food but I was pleased to see it was well done, the beef chalupas are my favorite. The cashier even brought our food to our table and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Its taco bell. 
That's all to be said about the food. 
However, this particular taco bell has THE friendliest staff of any fast food place I've been to. 
They are always upbeat, at first it's off putting because you are so accustomed to the person handing you your greasy food through the window being lackluster at best. Eventually you realize that they really are just this nice. I have never had someone roll their eyes or impatiently take my order. No, they are always happy to serve you. I've even had one fine gentlemen become concerned for my well being when I ordered a volcano burrito but no beverage. He wanted me to know it was very spicy. He continued to worry until I let him know I had a water bottle with me. 
Really. 
Nicest. People. Ever."}
{"text":"Beware of this location. Worst service ever. The few times I've had amnesia about how bad it was and have come back I'm reminded ten-fold just how terrible this location is. The last time we waited 25 minutes in the drive through. When we got to the cashier they were clueless - no apology, no nothing. The workers inside looked like they were moving in super slow motion and our food was incorrect as usual but the thought of going inside and trying to resolve my order was worse than the initial experience itself."}
{"text":"At 3 a.m. for some reason buying more food than I can eat for under $4 is a good thing.  In the realm of late night eating Taco Bell earns it's three stars for taking credit cards, having armed guards, and coining the euphemism that is \"fourthmeal.\""}
{"text":"Typically experience good customer service, but not today. Went there about 30 minutes ago and the lady running the window had zero customer service skills. No how are you, thank you, or goodbye. Literally asked about hot sauce and then less than a minute later forgets to include it. I'll stay away next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch on a Sunday.  Parking lot didn't have many cars.  Now I know why.  This place needs a good cleaning (inside and out).  Parking lot had trash everywhere.  I had to wipe the table off with a napkin before I could sit down.  Staff didn't seem too interested in working if you know what I mean.  Management must have taken the day off.  I won't be back ... Ever."}
{"text":"I had to give this location a few more try\"s before updating my review- but it looks like the management really pulled it around. This location has really good drive thru times, excellent customer service and they always give me exxxxtra fire sauce when I ask for it! Yumm! 

I appreciate all of the hard work you guys do- It's like this location is always jam packed-  maybe it's my timing... definitely up to taco bell standards! My go to location :D"}
{"text":"This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I asked for sauce at the drive thru and she threw one sauce in my bag. Which was super rude. Then I got home and we were missing one of the burritos which we paid for. We called and the same girl who was working the drive thru answered. Her name is Dori and she claimed to be the manager and refused to tell us who is above her and was incredibly unprofessional and rude over the phone. She in no way compensated for our troubles. To top it all of I found a piece of plastic in my burrito. Never going here again. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Customer service here sucks!  Every time I go to this location I am very disappointed. I go thru the drive thru and order and the person doesn't get my order right the first time or second time. Finally after repeating my order correctly I go to pay and they managed to still leave out one of the items I ordered."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and polite, whether it's 11 am or pm. Seems like there's something new to try, and they get your order out quick. Wish their dine in hours were a bit later for people without cars. They're also great with customizing orders."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks. They get our order wrong 95% of the time, and most of the employees have a really bad attitude. Which must be infuriating for the manager, because he's really nice."}
{"text":"So after that big fiasco of the strangest Taco Bell experience ever - corporate did issue a refund to my card. So that's definitely a plus. I will give this place another try and hopefully raise the star count then. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"worst. thing. ever. they are so cheap. 

we used a coupon, 5 tacos for 5$. i personally do not enjoy lettuce so i did not get any. but man, oh man, when that taco came out. it was 1/5 filled with meat & cheese. it looked so unappetizing. & the fact that i paid even 1$ for this was so horrible. we complained that this is nothing like the pictures & they denied and said there is a standard & how the fact that i did not get lettuce is the reason why it's only 1/5 full. so we complained some more & they said they would redo it for us. they re did it & it looked exactly the same. i honestly gave it a 1/5 stars because it tasted fine. but they were so cheap. i'm never going back."}
{"text":"The Six-Shrimp Taco meal came with a total of 10 shrimp. 

Every order before me (5) and every order after mine (3) was wrong, except for one. 

They fixed the mistakes on multiple of the wrong orders, but this is not a \"good\" Taco bell, though it was clean."}
{"text":"MMMM   the only memorable thing that happens is the change falling on the ground at the drive thru, for some reason this is a repeated problem.  (Stick with the credit card)"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDERS BEFORE DRIVING OFF. How hard is it to make an order right? I asked for NO MEAT on 2 Mexican pizza substitute it with beans. What did I get? Fucken meat no beans! My order said NO FUCKEN MEAT! And fast food restaurants want $15 an hour? How about you first start making customers orders right! The one on south jones and 215 is better then this place."}
{"text":"I've been to like 50 million Taco bell locations in my lifetime, OK maybe just 100, but this location is awsome sauce! They always has super fast service and super friendly employees."}
{"text":"That's shocking! For a place where the majority of your product has  beef, you've run out? And instead of offering chicken at the same price, or discounted I have to leave or pay more for your mistake. U! I can get a better product at another establishment. Even crappy McDonald's has comped a different choice, and I rarely go there. This used to be a place I'd go to after work. Not anymore! I can't give you 0 s, so I hope like a real star you burn for a long time and then fizzle out and die!

I approve this message!"}
{"text":"They used to be a pretty good TB, but lately the night crew has been super slow and rude. I've actually driven out of the drive through and to another fast food place two times THIS WEEK because it was taking an eternity to get my food. I don't typically have time to wait 25-30 minutes on my lunch break. In the same time it takes me to get my food from here, I can also go 5 minutes down the road, walk inside a Qdoba, order my meal on the burrito assembly line, and drive back. The only saving grace for the place right now is the one teenage guy that works here from time to time. Don't know his name, but he's nice, remembers me each time I visit, and seems to work fast. The one plus is that they've only messed up my order one time in the 40+ times I've been here, but I'm not sure if I'll keep coming back on my lunch breaks if they keep working so slowly."}
{"text":"Some kind of NASTY smell comes from this place. you can smell it out in the parking lot and all over the shopping center its in.

service is slow and all the little high school kids that work there are rude and have no regard for health or sanitation.... how about we try to put gloves on once in a while... that would be lovely."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but as of today I bought a iced coffee and the cream was curdled. I had to throw it out. Otherwise I'd get sick."}
{"text":"THIS IS FOR THE BREAKFAST MENU ONLY!  THIS REVIEW DOES NOT REFLECT THE LUNCH/DINNER MENU!

I had heard that Taco Bell started serving breakfast and decided to give it a try on Saturday at this location.  BLEH!  OMG!  You have got to be kidding me!  It was crap in a wrap! 

I got the b-fast tortilla with only eggs and cheese (I don't eat meat) with a hash brown and OJ.  The breakfast sandwich was full of sodium with no taste whatsoever.  The hash browns?  THE WORST EV-AH!  It was flat, overcooked, and maybe, mayyyyybe a few potato flakes were added before going into the deep fryer.  I am not kidding, it was grey.  I'm getting sick just typing this.  The OJ was a bit odd in only that the pic on the menu board made it appear that it would be in a cup like a fountain drink, but instead they gave me a bottle of Tropicana.  Uhm, okay...I guess.

Skip the new b-fast menu.  Stick with lunch and dinner.  They are good at that."}
{"text":"Wow this place is bad! There is always attitude towards customers. No wonder this location has such a horrible star rating. It might be convenient but the experience always sucks."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell. You can't expect that much from them. I ordered soft tacos and got my order. Which I'm pleased.

But the staff is so rude! After the employee handed me my food I said thank you have a nice day with a friendly smile and he rolled his eyes. Wtf lol. They all look like they hate their lives."}
{"text":"Just came from there and order a meal they gave me a totally different meal and I had to remind them to give me my drink.  Called the manger all she said is whenever I need to come back they'll remake it for me.  Ummmm immnot even from around this area.  No name no nothing


Went back today and the manger (didn't get his name) was very apologetic and offered me my money back or to refix the food.   He even offered me a drink.  I just took the taco and left"}
{"text":"Update your website hours!!! Closed at 3 am, website hours listed as 3:30 on Saturday!!!"}
{"text":"3 stars cause I love taco beezy. 
But man. 
I got the double chalupa on a whim, disregarding what everyone else has said about it online. 
And half of my chalupa seemed to be missing? Lol check it. 
But I love Taco Bell. So, I'll obviously be back"}
{"text":"This is the best run Taco Bell in Gilbert.  It's clear there is actual leadership.  We'll done to the staff."}
{"text":"Do not stop here if you are wanting fast food. Nothing about this place is fast! I thought it may have been a bad day the first time I was stuck in the drive thru line for nearly half and hour, but here I am stuck yet again! There was only three cars ahead of me and yet I've been in line for nearly 30 minutes and have yet to make it to the front of the line."}
{"text":"Depending on the day this Taco Bell can be very quick or slow. Now I know that when an employee calls in it can have an impact of service.
Either way you know when you go to a fast food restaurant your service is always up in the air as far as quality. 
However this Taco Bell has been quick the majority of my past visits. I have never had to go back for a missing item or dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"I ordered a quesarito with David asshat as cashier. Requested tomato to be added and payed 35 cents extra to do so. Received said quesarito without tomato. Good going messing up the order...."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is one of the worst I have ever come across. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes the same as any taco bell, but they have HORRIBLE service. For the second time I have waited over 20 minutes stuck in a drive-thru for food. When I went in to check on my food (they never brought it out) I saw employees sitting on the counter! After all that wait they have people not even working. Lucky Taco Bell's are a dime a dozen and I can just drive to another one."}
{"text":"First of all I love Taco Bell!! This Taco Bell I've been to quite a few times and they're always busy but fast. My order is always correct and I always modify something in my order. They're friendly, fast and right!! I will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"First off I have to start by saying, I LOVE TACO BELL.  I have grown up eating it and go there often.  

I went to this particular Taco Bell the other day after shopping at Kohl's.  This was my third time to this location, and once again I was not impressed.  This is the third time in a row that they have messed up my order.  This was the worst.

I am vegetarian, so I typically order my Mexican pizza with rice instead of beef.  I do not have problems at any other location, so I figured I would order it on this visit.  

Was charged an extra .60 for the \"rice\", got my stuff, and headed home.  I was starving by this point due to working all day.  I ate my pintos and beans, and proceeded to dig in to my pizza.  I ate one of the little triangles, and realized that something didn't taste right.  I looked closer only to discover there was rice ON TOP OF the beef!! I almost threw up my dinner on the spot!

Fuming, I immediately grabbed my receipt and called the store.  I asked the lady on the phone (who doesn't speak English) for the manager.  After trying to explain three times who I was asking for, she put me on hold.  

Around five minutes later, a lady got on the phone.  She didn't speak English either, and had nothing to say after I explained my situation.  I told her she needs to talk with her employees about paying attention to order's because some of us don't eat meat.  I also got into the disgusting details about what happens when we do eat it.

Needless to say, nothing was done, and I'm sure my complaint fell on deaf ears, but I at lest got to voice my concerns.  I will not be returning to this location no matter how hungry I am."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is what it is. And this location is pretty decent. The service is prompt, they do a good job with the food. I find that Taco Bell is one of those fast food chains where they're incredibly consistent with their food. From one location to the next, you order the same meal, it comes out looking exactly the same.

I have had a few instances of being slightly overcharged at the drive thru window but they've always rectified it (extra cheese instead of my dollar back? yes please). I will say that the drive thru window is slower than going in to get your food, and you do spend an inordinate amount of time waiting (or at least it feels that way) but it always ends up good.

The drive thru itself is oddly located in this plaza.. you have to circle the restaurant just to get to the ordering speaker and window. Other than that, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"The people at this Taco Bell are very nice they helped us through our order smoothly. One of the cooks over made so we got a free slushy! Our order was correct and one of my best visits to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Terrible!
I went during lunch hour so it was really busy in the drive thru. 
The line reaches out into traffic which is very dangerous. 
You are trapped in line since it's such a close drive thru. 
Today there were two landscapers working along side of the drive thru, they were using chain saws to trim bushes. 
Very dangerous! I could have reached out to touch them. 
I was waiting for a limb to fall on my new car. 
They couldn't hear you give your order because of the noise. Why are they doing that during rush hour ?
I ordered the new $5 box and when I got back to work I was missing two soft tacos .
Horrible experience. 
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Drive through is so slow its ridiculous.  Won't come again.  But at least they gave me money off for the wait."}
{"text":"Great service very friendly staff. Ordering soft tacos, once a week and the fresh made, no complaint . Plenty of parking place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Taco Bell for a little over a yr now. This is the only one I will go too because they know how to make food!!! I know it's just Taco Bell but they don't skimp on anything! It's made they way it was when I was younger. Been to a few others and they suck! Their morning shift and afternoon shift people are AMAZING! Great drive thru service and inside service!!!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell & this particular store has been good to me.

I have always ordered 1 thing & 1 thing only. The T9: Crunch Wrap Supreme with a soft taco, no tomatoes. Always amazing!"}
{"text":"Really gone downhill. Sat stuck in line for 15 min. Horribly slow . Not fast food anymore I guess"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've had Taco Bell so I bundled myself up and drove over.
We've all been new to the job at some point, but this poor older lady could barely walk, and had no idea where the keys were to ring it up.
 Luckily I had a sweatshirt brief around my waist, mostly because I need to lose weight, as the a/C was set at 12 degrees. Multiple people mentioned it while I was there.
 A Spicy Tostado is $.99, less a regular one so I tried it. It has a Chipotle Sauce. The sauce is gross. It tasted like it had gone bad.
 Luckily I had gotten Nachos Supreme, too. They were cold, covered in meat with barely any cheese or sour cream. Liberally sprinkled with tomatoes.
 In the twenty minutes it took me to eat three people tried to bus  my tray. I was using it. I finally gave and took everything off of it so they could have it.
 I'll go back to Roberto's, thanks. This was just gross."}
{"text":"There was a homeless guy snoring, laid out in the only large booth here. They took turns trying to rouse him as he yelled curse words at them. The final time he did get up and had cookie pieces stuck all over his face. I won't count any of that in this review, though.
 I ordered Nacho Bell Grande nachos and Mexican Pizza, for here. The pizza didn't have any visible sauce on it, and o knew it wasn't hiding under the cheese because there wasn't much of that either. There were a lot of anemic  tomatoes that looked and tasted like Bunnicula the Rabbit and attacked the garden. 
 The nachos were freezing cold, which didn't matter because the A/C would have gotten it anyway. 
 After the homeless guy was roused they cleaned every vacant table like they were afraid he may have left the herpes virus jumping like said Bunnicula from flat surface to flat surface.
 It is very clean in here and even in the face of being mistreated during the removal of Sleepy they maintained a pleasant professional manner.
 Next time I feel like sub par fast food I'll return, in  a year or two when it sounds good again."}
{"text":"Everyone that knows me knows I looooooove Taco Bell. So this review is for service, not food. It seems that more so than any other Taco Bell in town, THIS one messes up our orders almost every time. Today, my husband caught a mistake before he left the drive-thru window, went inside to have them fix and, and when he got home it was STILL wrong!! The staff here really needs to work on better attention to detail. I don't think it should be the customer's responsibility to unwrap and check each item before driving away."}
{"text":"Great food. I have been to many Taco Bell's. This one by far has the best service I have had at any fast food restaurant. I ate inside the restaurant which was very clean. The employees that I saw were very pleasant and smiling."}
{"text":"WARNING:  This is not so much a review but a \"Customer Service Announcement\" rather.
DO NOT ORDER THE TACO SALAD UNTIL TACO BELL ADMITS THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE OIL THEY USE!!  Their manager at this location admitted to us, my friend and I, that other customers have complained over the past month, implying that the top heads have been informed and so far NOTHING has changed as of October 2017!

To make a long drive thru story short, My friend ordered the Taco Salad and the shell was not only \"off\" but completely inedible.  He asked me to try it and I regretfully and reluctantly did so.  It tasted stale and burnt at first then the worst taste I've had in a long time came to me that can only be described as maybe burnt soap??  Whatever it was, it was absolutely disgusting and we went back to this establishment where the manager came right up to us and knew exactly what the issue was.  The taco salad.  She implied, \"Yeah, this isn't the first time.  Customers have been complaining constantly because they changed the oil they cook the shell in.\"  She understood, and gave my friend any other combo on the menu for our trouble but this review will stay here unless things change.  I love Taco Bell but I will not be ordering their Taco Salad until I'm GUARANTEED there is a change.  I'm just glad that Taco Bell has so many choices and hope they do not start changing more ingredients for their menu on my favorite items.  

SERIOUSLY THOUGH, EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE IF THIS IS TRUE OF THE TACO SALAD: If they did change the oil for good or if this was just a \"bad batch\" of Taco Shells then I hope that someone in management at headquarters listens and investigates before someone might get seriously ill over this change!"}
{"text":"How are you still in business?!?  Manager walks around be in open toe shoes cleaning up trays. But not the dining area. Not one table is clean as he sits on the table people watching after dropping off 5 trays. And all the staff is moving at a snails pace. There were only 5 people in line. Took 40+ minutes to PLACE our orders"}
{"text":"Have never had a problem here. Staff is very friendly and always willing to correct any issue."}
{"text":"Go to any other taco bell in the area!!! There's one on 59th and bell i believe. They literally have shorted me out of items I've paid for every time i go through the drive thru. Not even worth the convenience. Employees are always rude too. I know its taco bell but come on..."}
{"text":"Very fast efficient and clean. Food was very good I would come back to this Taco Bell in the future"}
{"text":"My order was not made how I requested, with creamy jalapeno sauce on side of my quesadilla, not in it as they always put too much.  Sauce was in and I didn't get sauce on the side.  Place for 11am was dirty, trash around. Yet many employees not looking that busy.  Again, at 11am it had several high school students in it.  There's nothing wrong with that in general, but maybe the truency officers should be hanging out here since it is located right across from HS."}
{"text":"Great place definitely love the nachos and great people.and close to home.best place for late night snack.and love the Baja blast.wish they would bring back the chili cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Super irritating when you come here they don't use gloves and when they do they touch the register the money and the screens is super unsanitary"}
{"text":"I had to try the new breakfast items just to say I did. I ordered an Am Crunchwrap with sausage and a bacon breakfast burrito. My husband ordered the Am Crunchwrap with steak and a burrito with steak. 

As for taste stick with the steak! It really makes the meal. I enjoyed my Crunchwrap with sausage, but it was nothing that great. But with the steak yes, please! The Crunchwrap is great if you are on the go or need to eat while driving. It has a layer of hash browns, a sausage patty, bacon or steak, eggs, and cheese. It's all held together in a flour tortilla that is then pressed so it all melts and melds the goodies together! 
The burrito with bacon was meh. It contained chopped bacon, scrambled eggs, and cheese. But again with the steak it totally transformed the burrito. And where are the beans? I think a Mexican breakfast burrito calls for beans! Just my suggestion :) 

Overall I learned on my visit is order the steak! Amazingly good flavor! Makes the bland burrito totally better."}
{"text":"I am working in the area.  I needed to eat and had limited time for lunch. I pulled in to get some food and a Diet Pepsi.  There was one car ahead of me. I sat there for 15 minutes thinking the car ahead of me had ordered a lot of food. No.  It was just a little bag and box. I heard the girl at the window say they were shorted staffed. I finally get to the window and pay.  I am then told they have just started my order. I said it does not take over 20 minutes to buy a taco at a drive thru.  They told me they are short staffed, only 3 people working today.  It is 5/29 (Memorial Day) between 12-1 pm.  3 people working...sounds like an internal issue.  Nonetheless, I finally just say give me my money back. Interestingly, the manager, Missy, can't seem to work the register. I did pay with a card and said cash was fine, but she was struggling.  I literally had to drive off without my money, so I would not be late for my 1 pm class. I spent an entire lunch break in the drive thru at this Taco Bell, and I actually ended up paying them for nothing!! I am sitting here, having finished one class and about to start another, with no food and very hungry.  I will file a dispute charge for a refund, but listen to the reviews. This place is awful. I never would have thought to check yelp before I could just grab a taco and diet pepsi from a local taco bell. Moral of this story....no taco bell!"}
{"text":"On a previous visit, my quesadilla was over cooked. So this time I specifically asked them to take it off the grill early. The young man at the window impressed me by asking how my quesadilla looked. When I hesitated, he took it back immediately. When he handed me the food, I said \"I'm sorry I'm so picky\" he said, \"it's ok, I only wanna make you happy\" Wow! What great customer service! The food here is always pretty good (even for picky eaters like me)"}
{"text":"I try to avoid writing reviews for businesses and food joints that aren't local, but I feel as if this Taco Bell location deserves its praises. 

First of all, I'm a fan of Taco Bell over other fast food because I'm a vegetarian. Taco Bell has a TON of options for vegetarians. My favorite is the potato taco. This location is particularly accommodating to my veggie needs. I can get extra vegetables at no extra cost, beans instead of beef, rice added, potatoes instead of something and no bacon or other meats on foods I may want. They will do anything for me, and that makes me really happy.

Another point to make is that this location has THE BEST staff. Everyone is always so nice to me and my boyfriend, they make conversation and fix any mistakes made very promptly. In fact, there are rarely mistakes at all. This also makes me happy, because fast-food workers tend to be overworked and underappreciated, and this leads to grumpiness! 

The store is typically clean, and it is also one of the only places open late in Forest Hills. It is in a convenient location to where I live, and that makes it all so appealing for those late nights coming home. 

I'm not a big fan of fast food, but I would definitely like to stress that this particular store is simply astounding. The employees certainly deserve the praise, and I hope to continue to see the store improve and offer yummy options for when I'm on a super-duper budget."}
{"text":"I work close by so unfortunately I come here often and right now it's a Wednesday night at 7:30 PM and I've been sitting in line for eight minutes now. I haven't even made it past the menu board. You can't make this stuff up. I should just go in and order. Apparently they don't don't understand staffing. They should go to Monona and see how to run a Taco Bell.  I timed it. Over 20 minutes to get my order. It was incorrect."}

Employees are entering the PS4 codes that are printed on the $5 boxes.
SUCH BS!
WTF! I made the manager give me 4 different boxes and ALL the codes \"were already used\".
I'm calling corporate today to complain.  Not because the 40 year old AA guy was eating food on the prep line, NO....but because this location has employees that are unethical.
The WHOLE PS4 marketing campaign is destroyed.
This makes me not want to give them anymore of my money."}

{"text":"Still best Taco Bell! Just got lunch there at 11:30 (normally busy time) waited a little longer then normal but nothing that was out of the normal for lunch and when we got to the window they gave us our order for free because of the wait! What a pleasant surprise! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I feel weird rating my Taco Bell experience but after going to a certain Madison location this was serious the best way I could have ended my day. I live in Madison and work in Waunakee and sometimes my long busy does not allow me time to eat even though I work in a restaurant. Pulled up 5 minutes before they close thinking that they were open later and find out I was going to be \"one of those guys\". I asked about their closing time and was informed of it and I apologized but he said they would make anything I wanted. Drove up and the guy at the window was super friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job very much. We shared some words about me never visiting this location and how I manage the restaurant down the street, we related, I received my perfect hot order and I was on my way. Thanks, I will visit this location now on my way home instead of the Madison mineral point location.
Cheers!"}

Sounded like they were laughing as well. Not happy at all. Won't go to this location again. This has happened to me before. Missing items in bag from location as well. Thanks a lot"}

Get there at 1:30am on a Tuesday late night after I close my restaurant and cars driving through and out telling me while I pull in their closed and those drivers were pissed. Change your yelps hours or figure this location out. The reviews are so bad for this one. I give a one star because I like the brand but seriously I hope someone that cares reads these reviews and fixes the issues. The hard choices need to be made fur the good of the business....so make them"}
{"text":"I ordered one taco, just wanted a quick bite to eat. The taco is what I expected it to be. The service here really wasn't the best I have had. I was kind of disappointed. I went through the drive-thru, they have two windows, one to pay and one to pickup. I went to the first window to pay. I saw the worker inside the window, but it took her awhile just to even realize I was there. I've been to other company's drive-thru and they open the window right away and say hello. If they are too busy to take your money, they say something. Here, she opened the window after awhile and just said the total. No hello or anything else."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's Taco Bell and the food is exactly what you expect here. The service has always been good when I have been there. Unlike other fast food places on this stretch of South Blvd., my order has never gotten \"lost\" and my order is ready in a timely manner. The service is good and the cleanliness is above average for Taco Bells."}
{"text":"Almost 10 minutes waiting in the drive-thru to get to the box to place my order, another 7 minutes to actually place my order, another 4-5 to get to the window & then get to the window to find that I couldn't use my chosen method of payment..About 20 minutes of my life wasted & no dinner to show for it. I don't know what's happened to this location but it's really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Less than 0 stars.. My 1 star is for the off the clock gentleman who offered to get me warm water for my daughter, unaware that the manager already told me no.. I went to Taco Bell on the way to Az.. My daughter had a knarly kanker sore inside her lip.. Those are no joke, especially when your 9 and wanting tacos.. I asked the REGIONAL MANAGER for warm water so I could put salt in it, we could swish, and be on our way.. She said no.. Its against the policy.. So frustrating and I'm only posting because this made me so frustrated.. Policy over common decency.. I just hate the idea of this becoming the norm.."}
{"text":"I came here 3 separate occasions and each time waited 20min when there were only a couple cars in front. The food was okay got the NBG wrong but they fixed it and they were nice. I never bother to come here because they are SLOW! I always go to the Taco Bell on Skypointe they are fast and food is hot and perfect!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The food was fantastic. Whoever the man serving the drive thru after midnight deserves a raise."}
{"text":"I stop at this Taco Bell on my way home from work in Scottsdale.  Their service is always Great Food always hot and fresh.  The Employees are Great."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is on its toes and for what it is, the food is fresh, service is great and the establishment is always clean. I'm very impressed with the speed of their drive through."}
{"text":"So I don't know if the employee taking the order was just not paying attention, didn't care or if it was the person making the order but I am beyond irate that my order was messed up and then they wouldn't even answer their phone. 

I had my boyfriend go to Taco Bell tonight to get me dinner. Now I am on a low carb diet so my order was a specialty order 

3 sides of beef 
1 side of onions 
1 side of sour cream 
2 sides of cheese 
1 side of lettuce 

A couple hours later after I hit the gym come home and shower I go to eat my food I was so looking forward to and my damn order has no onion, it's nothing but beans, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. 

Umm wtf where is the meat and why is there beans instead of beef?!?!? 

I guess my mistake was having him go to this location instead of our normal one on ft Apache. I also wish I could give it no stars!!!

Thank you for effing up my order and ruining my night!!!"}
{"text":"This location has really gone downhill in the past 6 months. Always long waits inside and at drive thru. When I go inside, employees are always in a frenzy and stressed. Management you need more employees or better trained employees, I am not sure what the problem is."}
{"text":"It seems a little weird to review a Taco Bell. I mean you've been to one you've been to them all, right? But I just had some of the best customer service The lady at the drive-through was super nice, and they were quick with my order even though I changed it at the window. I told my husband the same thing when I got home, and he said they're always super friendly when he goes as well.

It can't be easy to work a fast food job with a positive attitude and a genuine smile on your face, so kudos to the staff at this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Normally, I go to the Taco Bell @ 99th & McDowell, but I was out running errands and stopped here.  The girl at the drive thru was rude and rushed, even though there was no one in front of me.  I got up to the window, and she huffed when I asked for a drink holder.  The cardboard food containers weren't closed properly and kept popping open on the way home.  One time, it knocked a taco out of the bag, which also wasn't wrapped correctly, (just scrunched around the taco and open at the top), so now I get to clean sour cream, lettuce and cheese out of my console.  Next time, I'll just go to the 99th & McDowell location."}
{"text":"We get food here about once a month.  This location has always gotten our orders correct, they package their food correctly, and have friendly staff.  I usually get a taco salad, and it has been fresh every time with the hot stuff hot and the cold stuff cold.  (BTW - if it isn't out of your way, visit this location, NOT the one @ 107th & Indian School.)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. We ordered a chicken chalupa and crunch wrap supreme, but we really stopped by out of curiosity to try the new nacho fries. 

17 minutes to get our food, and it was not very busy. Chalupa and wrap were ok; the fries were beyond awful. It appears like they cooked enough fries for the entire second shift in the early afternoon - they literally had stacks upon stacks of precooked and bagged fries piled up on a piece of equipment behind the counter. The fries were room temperature at best, and it's chilly in here!  Needless to say, I won't try them again."}
{"text":"Taco Bells all serve the same food in the US. However the employees, location, and cleanliness all vary. This is one of the cleanest TBs I've been in! One HUGE difference is Carl, a 3-year employee, who knows what customer service is.  Even with the transient type person was greeted and handled professionally. He offered him a water cup when he said he had no money. Carl picked up everyone's trash, greeted everyone that came in and left.  That's an employee that's hard to find in any fast food business and in most customer service businesses. Not too sure of the location as we are from out of town. Clean outside and in, Carl is the best!"}
{"text":"Requela R. Our cashier is the best fast-food worker I've ever encountered. She was constantly working the whole time we were eating. She was wiping tables, counters, stocking sauces, napkins, etc. You can tell she takes great pride in her work.  Just look at the pics of her stocking job."}
{"text":"The drink area is almost always a disgrace. The friendly regular staff and good food is why I keep coming back. Clean the place up!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love Taco Bell anyhow.  But I went to pick up take out for my hubby and wow...the drive thru attendant was SO friendly!

Just wanted to say thanks for the excellent customer service.  We frequently grab food from this particular Taco Bell and I appreciate the hearty \"thanks for your business!\"

I wish I could remember his name, but next time.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"4 stars for a Taco Bell?  Yes and here is why -

The line at the drive-thru during lunch hour Monday - Friday moves pretty darn fast!  No matter how long that line is they get you in and out. Scott, the gentleman that is at the first window is always pleasant and friendly. He's always got something nice to say and does it with a smile.  When you arrive at the second window to pick up your food again you are greated with a smile.  Most of the time I am asked how may day is going which is sure more than I can say for most fast food drive thru places.  The staff here really does care about their customers.  And if you go inside it's the same way.  They are busy but fast.  It seems the manager has a cohesive team here that works well together.  That is a rare thing in fast food.  I have never had a bad meal here and everything is fresh and hot. This is probably the best Taco Bell I have ever been to and I will continue to give this one my business.  It's close to my office and a great, cheap option for lunch.  Thanks Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has been going downhill for a long time. 
For starters, there is a lady that works the morning (I will not be posting their names though I remember them) that is never in a good mood in the morning that works the drive thru. And almost all the time when I go around to the window, she is hanging her head out the window watching, which I personally find obnoxious and creepy. 
Next, the service is getting terrible. Almost all the time they mess up on my order. And the kicker is when they dont hand me my receipt, they always say its in the bag, but its not there, so I have no proof its wrong. 
And last, when i was there very recently (08/15/2017), one of the girls working back there was filling up her own personal container with one of the drink dispensers back there and was also using her own hands to put ice in it. Now that may seem small and silly to others, but to me its very unprofessional, mainly since they are working, and she should use a cup provided there to drink her drink. 

Now there are way more things that have gone wrong here, but ill leave it at that."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has the absolute WORST customer service EVER! 
The workers have a bad attitude 9/10 times I come during dinner time. Most will not let me finish ordering whenever I have a request about an item (such as not having a certain topping). 
I even got a sauce packet once that had \"f*ck me\" written on the back of it. 

If the manager of this store sees this post, or if corporate sees this, please really evaluate the employees at this location, cause they really need to work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Worst experiences in the past week ever. I waited in the drive thru over 20 minutes for a Boss Nacho and then today walked in and kept being told 1 more minute. After over 5 minutes of waiting and having workers laugh about it I LEFT. Also it should be noted one cat went through the drive thru."}
{"text":"There was nothing fast about this fast food establishment. It was so slow. I only ordered two things and I sat and waited, after I paid, for about 6 minutes. The first item, a soft taco supreme, was not a supreme. I checked my receipt and it was ordered correctly as a supreme, just not made correctly. My niece was so disappointed that she didn't get her sour cream and tomatoes. The next item, a cheesy gordita crunch was just a mess. Only half the shell was even filled with anything, it looked like they stuffed it on its side. And it was just lettuce with a few shreds of cheese. My sister used a spoon to try to spread the filling out and we couldn't even see any meat until we emptied the whole shell, there was maybe 1/2 tsp of meat in there. What a waste."}
{"text":"This is just food. It's not fast food. Even with a completely empty line, both times I went, I ended up waiting much longer than I should have for chips. They're just chips."}
{"text":"I come through here more often than I should because I'm honestly too lazy to get out of the car to get some chips. They've recently put a new person on the drive-thru, named Keith, and he is the most obnoxiously annoying human ever. He thinks he's being cute using a \"welcome to the carnival\" voice exclaiming how happy is he to be able to assist me and it's really just annoying. Can he just take my order like a normal human being and not try to sound like a pre-programmed recording? I guess I should be thanking Keith because he's made me not want to return there. Next time I'll just pass on my craving for chips."}
{"text":"Usually don't review fast food but just had to after a not so great Taco Bell experience. Usually I love Taco Bell and rarely have any problems. This one however, was a problem. My food was kind of cold. Very unusual from Taco Bell (for me at least) because usually its piping hot. I got the new Mini Quesadilla and the cheese was not fully melted and both my chicken burritos were warm at best.
They get a sympathy star added because the girl working the drive thru was very friendly."}
{"text":"I asked for 3 shredded chicken mini quesadillas and two of them were burnt. When I asked for two different ones and they gave me two more burnt quesadillas. In addition, while I was waiting for the equally  burnt quesadillas, one of the employees (female with dirty blonde hair) came out to ask \"Who was it??\" With an attitude as if I was asking them to do something other than their jobs, she proceeded to laugh about it. I don't know how many customers you have that like burnt food, but I think you should not assume people want their food to lay on the stove for 10 minutes. And let me make it clear that I was kind, I asked nicely if I could speak to someone who wasnt busy cause I didnt want to interrupt anyone. Go elsewhere if you want good service and properly cooked food. Money down the drain. But hey, I got a good amount of cheese on my tacos."}
{"text":"Diego, the Drive-Thru Attendant, was very kind, pleasant, and professional. You have a great employee and his upbeat personality exemplifies good customer service. We will be recurring customers because of him."}
{"text":"Yay!   I love to eat a variety of burritos and this Taco Bell makes them just the way I would make it if I were making 6 burritos, but they make it all in one with some magical process I can't fathom!

You see, you order a Burrito Supreme.  When you begin to eat it you will be surprised to discover that it is only a Sour Cream Burrito.  How cool is that!  A sour cream burrito!

But then you have another bite and Wow!  The very same Sour Cream Burrito has somehow transformed into a Lettuce Burrito!  How refreshing is that!  A Lettuce Burrito to chase a Sour Cream Burrito!  Perfect cool summer fare!

But then you have another bite of this magical Burrito Supreme and Zowie!  You are now eating an Onion and Diced Tomato Burrito!  Again, how brilliant and refreshing is that!

But that is not it my friends, the odyssey is far from over!  With the very next bite the Onion & Diced Tomato Burrito has vanished and you are eating a Cheese Burrito!  

Not only that but there are 2 bites of this incredible Cheese Burrito!  The 1st bite is cold shredded cheese and the very next is melted cheese!  Did you follow that!  Cold shredded cheese immediately followed by melted cheese!  Obviously this Taco Bell has developed and utilized some kind of device capable of altering the thermodynamic properties of matter itself!  For use on burritos!  Truly amazing!

I know, nothing else could possibly top what has already transpired with my Burrito Supreme but with the very next bite my burrito had again transformed into yet another burrito!  This time I found myself enjoying a Beef Type Meat Product Burrito!  

As if all of this had not already been enough, my final 2 bites of this magical burrito were a Bean Burrito!  I kid you not!

I was so awestruck and speechless at the heretofore unheard of Magical Burrito Supreme that I was not able to carry myself back into the Taco Bell to congratulate these remarkable Magical Burrito makers!  Perhaps one day I will again venture to this Taco Bell.  I had no idea that the mythical border in Taco Bell's subtle advertising campaign was that of the supernatural itself!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Drive thru clerk was very nice and helpful.we got our order right away. We will comeback again for sure."}
{"text":"Not one of the better taco bells around.  It looks so beautiful, but they just fall a little short on food quality and service.  I've been here a few times and both times they put way too much sour cream in my burritos (burritos shouldn't be 1/3 sour cream... ewww), and were a little slow on the assembly times.  The staff just don't really seem to care about their jobs.  The first time I went their they guy making my food had his pants down to his knees, and although his shirt was long, it still didn't get down that far... not the guy I'd want making my food.  The other time, the staff were just smoking right outside the front door, which of course was blowing into the restaurant (you guys here about the smoke-free illinois act?).     

All-in-all, not so great."}
{"text":"I've been here way too many times now, and felt it was time to review.  

The service here is generally just okay.  They often forget to give me my drink or Doritos, but fix it without any hassle when asked.  The food itself I've never had an issue with; always pretty good.  Location is pretty convenient, even more so now that the 22 Illini bus stops right out front. 

Up until about a week ago, they had a bunch of \"out of order tables\" (broken tables), but recently they installed new menus, removed broken tables, and removed the railing for the wait line, so it's looking a little better, but the restaurant still isn't in that great of condition.

All-in-all, for being cheap and reliably good food, i'll give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This location has friendly service , and great food. To top it off , they have wifi. So stop writing hateful reviews everyone , gosh. Makes me so tired. Just enjoy the food and stop being jerks."}
{"text":"I love this place , very close to the library and art museum I frequent. Clean interior and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with my order, I didn't like the cashier who instead of asking my name for the order takes a long look at my card before handing it back."}
{"text":"I have to stress that I used to eat here often , but I travel back and forth from Tempe and Glendale so I just eat along my route. I went here last sunday , and got very bad service. I ordered the meal deal number 4 , the 5 layer burrito with doritos and a medium soda. The 5 layer barely had any meat , any beans , or anything for that matter. To cut costs I'm guessing, they put a smaller tortilla inside a larger one to make the thing seem fuller than it was. I went up and got my money back. I am surprised at this because I usually have excellent service here. But then again the management and employees have changed , my favorite people aren't there anymore. Used to be a good one."}
{"text":"I like to come in here and write songs while I eat. I like how the management won't hound me to leave even when I'm on for an hour at least."}
{"text":"It's a rare day when I review a fast food chain.  I don't really eat fast food much (except maybe Subway).

That being said, this is the absolute friendliest and cleanest Taco Bell I have ever visited.  Usually, Taco Bell is just a cheap place with clumpy refried beans and workers who are barely muddling through the day.  Not this location!  As unbelievable as it is, I don't get the impression that everyone here hates their job.  Furthermore, the food is just a little bit fresher than your standard Taco Bell fare."}
{"text":"This is the only Taco Bell in the malvern area that I'm aware of. It's not the best location but it's still something if you're really craving tacos. They recently did renovations, it looks nice and clean. I find that the staff at this location have HORRIBLE customer service skills. I've only been here a couple times and every time I do the staff just show me more why I shouldn't. The food though is quality of any Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  Got there at 7:30 but the dinning area didn't open till 8am so had to go though drive though."}
{"text":"It's says that they close at 1am on the app.  I got there at 12:15 and told me to go to another location."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell I have ever been to. The employees are extremely pleasant, kind and customer driven. They often strike up a conversation with you.

While no fast food  resturant is perfect, this is among the best. I go at least once a week from Blakeney (a healthy drive but it's the closest location)."}
{"text":"The bacon quesarito is phenomenal! This location is slower than most Bells but also cleaner than most!"}
{"text":"This taco Bell is just so unlike all the other taco bells. Should have looked at the other reviews first but no exaggeration with the wait. Even when placing the order it had to be repeated and corrected five times. The workers were all just walking in and out of kitchen to the eating area just chilling and talking to friends. One person on beat break just started eating tacos with his gloves still on walking around. The bathroom ran out of soap. All the tables still had messes on them.

But I must say, the redeeming quality was that the food was immaculately made. My chalupa looked like that in the advertisement. The quesadilla was super cheasy. The food was surprisingly crafted! So that may be why it took forever..   wish I remembered to take a picture."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Taco Bell establishment for almost 10 years. To this day, and dozens of times eating here, I have never had a order been done right. Not once. Today I ordered a potato soft taco, and was so excited because there was no cheese on it and I thought they finally got something right, but low and behold, they ripped up two potato wedges from the KFC menu, and stuck them in the taco and tried to hide it by putting a bunch of lettuce on top of it. It was one of the most vile looking things I have ever seen. To top that off, I asked for a crunch wrap supreme without sour cream, and that must have been too much to ask for because there was sour cream in my crunch wrap. I would give this Taco Bell a negative star, hands down the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. Even the tacos bells in New Jersey can get their food right. The only humane thing to do in this situation would be to condemn the building so the ghosts of awful burritos past can finally rest. Shame."}
{"text":"As I have just left this location. I asked for HOT sauce and they served me a huge handle full of fire..... and ordered a bottled water and received a Pepsi."}
{"text":"I live close to this Taco Bell location, and have been here several times in the past year.  Every time I go the staff is super polite, and the order is always correct.  My husband and I have been impressed by them, because for a fast food joint, everything is normally subpar in that regard.  I go through the drive thru and don't eat in the dining room, so I can only speak on the drive thru aspect."}
{"text":"Thank you, Taco Bell.  For letting me waste my money.  My \"chicken quesadilla\" came with 3 small pieces of chicken, a squirt of sauce, and a pinch of cheese.  Also loved being greeted with a sigh and treated like I was a burden to be giving business at this location.  Lovely experience."}
{"text":"Man, I'm not sure why came back here. It continues to be run poorly and the quality has suffered. Another disappointed customer."}
{"text":"Just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date. I've gone hear at least 30 times before and this is the first time that I can honestly say it sucked. They weren't really busy, since I went at 10:30 am. I hope this isn't a new trend."}
{"text":"This is my breakfast place I go to 2 to 3 times a week. 

The staff are always friendly and courteous. Luisa is the morning manager when I go and is always nice and pleasant to talk to when ordering.

Food: I try to be nice and stick with the lower calorie foods on the menu. It's pretty simple and straight forward for the soft tacos I order. Sometimes they skimp on the lettuce and it doesn't look as they normally do. 

The friendly staff is the main reason I keep returning to this location."}
{"text":"The Store was clean . I was promptly greeted by Kayla. She was kind and pleasant made me feel welcomed . Great customer service . Thank you Kayla"}
{"text":"If you don't mind wasting your whole lunch break in the drive through line this is the location for you. I literally just spent 35min in the drive through at 11:30 am and there was only 5cars ahead of me. I would rate a zero if it was an option. Once I got to the window they didn't even apologize for the long wait. So much for \"fast food\""}
{"text":"Grew up eating these tacos so,.. All I can say it that it brings back good times. Still taste the same and it's very much fast food nothing fancy"}
{"text":"After visiting Hollywood Cone, I meandered through the connecting parking lot to figure out what stores were around. I had also thought about getting a bite to eat.

I noticed that this Taco Bell had a long lineup. I decided give it a try.

I ordered the soft taco combo, which gives you two beef tacos. I upgraded to nachos supreme, and indicated that I didn't want any sour cream on it as well as in my tacos. Done! I also got a Diet Pepsi.

This Taco Bell has been around for a while. Pulling up to the drive-thru made me think that this place has been there for decades, with a feel of being back in the early 1990's or something.

The car in front of me was clearing out a ton of garbage and stuffing everything in one of the conveniently placed garbage bins. As for me, I only had an empty Starbucks cup to dispose of.

The staff that I dealt with were friendly, competent, and wonderful. I got my order and went back to the hotel to eat it.

My food hit the spot. I love nachos supreme. Yummy!

{"text":"Very disappointed with coming here and there's no breakfast being served (it was before 10:00am) so, we ordered a chicken power bowl & it was ok I guess but I'm not too sure about the chicken and if it was real or not? Lesson learned to just make breakfast at home with egg whites and turkey bacon"}
{"text":"horrible service, in the drive thru the girl spills soda on me and instead of saying she is SORRY she says WELL HOW WAS I TO KNOW THERE WAS SODA ON THE LID? 
then she just walks off, doesn't offer me a napkin or say anything else, just left it for someone else to address... 
NEVER AGAIN!"}

{"text":"I pass 3 Taco Bell's to come to this location. Their crunch wraps are loaded and always fresh."}
{"text":"This location smells so bad. I lost my appetite and my food sucked anyways unfortunately."}
{"text":"Why will they never give me more than 3 packets of sauce it drives me nuts. I work near this Taco Bell I eat here often even when I ask for 10 I get 3.  Lame!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Order 213602. Just was weird my gf ask if you have the volcano taco and the guy said I never heard of it got me mad that he had never heard of it. And I told my girlfriend they stop doing that. And the guy keep on saying that he never heard of it. I told him there use to be a while ago volcano sauce/taco I guess he didn't know what he was saying."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell their food is always fresh and they are very fast and always get my order correct! Friendly staff and a convenient location."}
{"text":"Someone @ corporate please please please pull the life support plug on this chain. 

When you walk in you feel like you've stepped into the 1990's. The place looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned since last Apollo mission. Never-mind the facility, the staff aren't better. I felt like I was talking to an angry dolphin through a glass wall at Sea-World. They nod and make noises as if they understand you but when it comes time to make your order and then give it to you it seems to be too daunting of a task. A pack of four year-olds has more chance to prove String Theory than this place does in getting your order right. 

That being said, this place is Taco Bell and it serves Taco Bell. So they get that... I also had a beggar who was loitering in the lobby who tried to take my food from me and force his way into my car as I tried to leave as an added bonus. This is not the fault of the establishment but they should probably take the hint that a homeless man in their lobby trying steal from paying customers is maybe, just maybe, bad for business."}
{"text":"Finally writing a review after multiple bad drive through experiences here. Hoping someone cares about reviews enough to make things better, I used to love TB as a quick meal option. I ask for extra lettuce and sour cream every time. This time I was charged extra for each, no problem whatsoever... until I open my order. Two shreds of lettuce is what I get for \"extra\" and I almost never get sour cream even on supreme orders that come with it. The nacho chips somehow taste stale and burnt at the same time. Asked for hot sauce, got mild. Etc... it's so frustrating because I realize after I have left the area and can do nothing about it. The Pepsi was the only thing on point, but it was perfectly refreshing so thanks for that part :)"}
{"text":"Always great service as always super polite in drive thru. There's always a line but they get through it quickly with a smile."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell. Service tends to be rude. They are close early almost every time I go. Generally out of things and unapologetic about it. I love Taco Bell, but this store has me spending money at Del Taco more and more. Such a shame the management is so awful here."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as every other taco bell I've been to. It's kind of weird that they only have one hot sauce though... usually they have fire, mild, and several salsas which this one doesn't. Maybe they only do all the other sauces in the US.

But it's a 2 minute walk from where I'm currently working so I'm obligated to frequent taco bell while it's convenient."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat the service is fast the drive thru gal is so nice the food is always great I'm getting hungry just thinking about the good.iys clean well maintained one of the best taco bells"}
{"text":"Back a year later and still would rate less than one star! 
No meat in my crunch wrap. I bet they were closing and out of meat and didn't want to cook anymore. I can't stand this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm near Steely Dan (as we call Steelyard Dr) I gots to ring the Bell. I love the Dorito tacos. One of the best things the Bell has come up with. Also the crunchy beefy burrito with all that cheese. MMM MMM MMM! I love going to this Bell because the service is prompt, the food is fresh, and it's truly one of the cleanest establishment I've ever eaten at, and trust me, I know clean because I was in the joint and had to be the one cleaning the cafeteria and I also worked as a janitor in the Woods of Ingle so when Nyron says clean, you can take it to the bank. I also love that the soda is mixed right. That's a big pet peeve of mine, if they don't have the mix right, like too syrupy, or too watery. Well, trust me, you won't get Aunt Jemima or Perrier when you order a Pepsi at this Bell. But one of the main reasons I love this Bell is that it is next to a big ass parking lot where I can dock my land yacht, my 1971 Hulk green Eldorado. It got gold rims, chain steering wheel with zebra stripe, and cheetah interior. This car is a magnet for Swedish chics cause all they got back home is ABBA and dudes with bowl-cuts who drive SAABS and Vohoes and are sensitive and into emo shit like Chris Gains and Robert Morrisey Cure. I got a badass stereo and I bump old school baby baaaaby. Aiiiight? Peace!"}
{"text":"I've written some negative reviews of CLT area fast food recently so wanted to show I can give credit where credit is due.  I've gotten drive thru at this TB location a dozen times and never had any problems or messed up orders.  We Yelpers should always keep in mind that the restaurant biz is hard often thankless work- especially fast food- so it's nice to say that most times I've gone here the employees have been friendly and upbeat.  Can't give you five stars since this Taco Bell afterall but 4 stars for the good work.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell used to be awesome. We live closer to another location, but have chosen to drive a bit further to this location because they always used to get our food right and have great customer service. Unfortunately, the last 4 visits have been bad. At least two items missing, food made wrong etc. As an avid Taco Bell eater, I know you have to check the bag before you drive away. But sometimes the bag is so full you think you counted correctly. It's really frustrating when you get home and are missing food you paid for. We usually don't go back and just take the loss. But it's getting ridiculous. Tonight, I ordered a chicken soft taco. They basically forgot the chicken. See the pic. What kind of business allows this? It's not hard to make tacos, y'all. I've worked fast food as a teenager and it's not rocket science. Anyway, based on the other bad reviews, I'm clearly not the only unhappy customer. Hopefully management checks these yelp reviews so they can fix whatever issue is causing this."}

I also like the new Beefy Crunch Burrito (if eaten right away & it still \"crunches\"). :)"}
{"text":"Never fails my order is always messed up! I'm eating a breakfast burrito with I tiny speck of egg in it. Basically a rolled up tortilla!! Then they always say bring it back???? No thanks not worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to drive thur and guy was nice and I order one thing without tomatoes and he asked me if I wanted no tomatoes on the rest of my lunch and that was what I wanted. Thanks"}
{"text":"Mexican pizza was extremely gross. Made me sick. Tasted like it was old and reheated 10 or 15 times before I got it. Lady at front gave a a dirty look when I asked for something else. Just keep on driving."}
{"text":"Uhhh...no. Nope. Uh-uh. 
My son and I rarely even go to fast food places, and this Taco Bell is a terrific example of why.
Take a look at the generous portion of meat and cheese on one of the boy's tacos. Can you see it? Grab a magnifying glass.
Pepsi? We tried, but the auto-dispense issues one part syrup to (I'm guessing) a hundred parts soda water. Told the server...and she acknowledged the problem, walked away and took zero action to fix it.
Floor...dirty. Staff enthusiasm...non-existant.
Wow..."}
{"text":"Very nice customer service. Fast and don't have to wait very long. Although when I order chips and guacamole, sometimes I'll get a big black sauce container and sometimes I'll get a little filbertos sauce cup. Like serious? I love my chips and guac.  even when ordered on the Long johns silver side we didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"This place it's the worst, I waited for 30 minutes in the drive thru just to get my order wrong, it's not the first time that happens, don't eat here, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Literally just waited 25 minutes in the drive-through pull up to the window and didn't get a sorry for the wait I upgraded your drink for you lol"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever!!! Very rude food was cold!! Now sauce was given or napkins! I will never return"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is one of the few fast food restaurants I still go to. They haven't disappointed me...yet. The food was good & my experience too but this location specifically is totally 90s decor. I thought I was in a McDonalds when Ronald was still around lol"}
{"text":"I live down the street, so obviously I would come here a lot. Sadly, every time I come here I have to wait upwards to 30 minutes in the drive thru. But if that wasn't bad enough, the only thing this location is consistent with is getting my order wrong and making me wait a lifetime for an incomplete or incorrect order.  I never rate or review, but tonight was the final straw. I ordered 2 xxl grilled stuffed burritos and a steak quesadilla with their new fries. Easy enough right? No, they still left out one of my burritos. I will not be coming back ever again. Please folks, don't waste your time, but if you have time to waste, please check your order before driving off because I guarantee you they will have it wrong."}
{"text":"first trip through was so fast, with a line of four cars in front of me. as soon as I pulled away I realized I had forgotten to add my friends order so I got right back in line, which was double in size. I couldn't believe that I was through that line within the time I could eat my bean burrito! 

The girl working the window, Monica I believe, was very pleasant and served me with a smile. I wish there were more Taco Bells in Chicago, especially ones with service like I received here!"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell had good food but really poor service. Our cashier seemed indifferent started calling to another co-worker before we left the counter, which was annoying and rude. We thought we heard our order called but weren't sure because it was called and whoever called it just walked away as soon as it was on the counter. So naturally I go out to see if it was ours and our cashier is nowhere to be seen. I stand there for awhile and wait until I finally get someone to help. I grab my food, sit down, and realize we didn't get drinks. So I walk back up to the counter and repeat my waiting process. Even though this Taco Bell is in a convenient location, I will be finding a new one. Just an overall annoying experience."}
{"text":"The girl taking the orders was rude. She rushed our order. We ordered one item and she told us our total and informed us the order was complete. She totally disregarded us after that. The young man at the first window was however very polite and added to our order with no rudeness. This Taco Bell would be great if they just fired the lady who lacks any knowledge of customer service."}
{"text":"Had some trouble with the order radio so we went in to order. We got food to feed a family of 5 so, with  no one else in line or in the store, we went through it with the cashier, took our time and paid. The floor in front and back was in need of a sweep an mop. There were a couple trainees on the food line so it took some time. No biggie. Left and Had to come back because we were missing 5 items. Polite trainees but really unpleasant manager. Finally left with a refund for one drink and the missing tacos and burrito. Corporate needs to drop in on this bunch more frequently, especially the evening crew. Clean it up a bit and get a manager who is comfortable leading a team."}
{"text":"It may seem strange to give a fast food place 4 stars, but compared to virtually every other fast food place in the area, this Taco Bell deserves it.

I've always found this location to be clean with a well-trained staff. They usually do a pretty good job of getting orders right, although I wouldn't say it's 100%. The few times they've forgotten something, they'll usually toss in a free bag of cinnamon twists for the trouble. 

Unless there's a lunch or dinner rush, they're quite efficient with food preparation time. About 25% of the times I've been here, my order was ready before I finished filling my drink.

At peak times, the drive thru can get backed up, and you may want to avoid it around 1:30pm during school weekdays, as students from Foothill descend on this place after school.

When I'm looking for cheap fast food (that is actually fast), this Taco Bell is on my short list."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is always clean, and my food arrives quickly. Most of the times I've been here, it has been rather empty. The drive thru can get a bit busy at night, however. The last couple of times I went here, I found it to be unusually cold inside, which may not be a bad thing in a Vegas summer.

Overall, a clean and efficient Taco Bell with a courteous and capable staff."}
{"text":"I know I'm not paying for 5 star service at a Taco Bell, but sheesh! 

When we arrived, there were 2 other people in the entire place.  We stood near the registers ready to order but there was nobody there to help. After a minute or two, a man came to take our order.  He definitely loved his job... not.  After Mr. Ray of Sunshine took our order he forgot to give us our drink cups and walked away.

I volunteered to wait at the register to get the drink cups while the rest of the party I was with sat down.  The girl working the drive through window kept looking over and ignoring me as I stood there trying to get her attention.  She kept huffing and puffing and stomping around.  Finally after looking at me six times (yes I counted) she says \"Ugh, did somebody help you?\" I mentioned that we did not receive our drink cups.  So she stomped over and goes \"here\" and slams our drink cups on the counter.  Wow, sorry for making you take an extra 4 steps to help a customer when there is no one even in the drive through line!  

After the drink cup fiasco, it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  Once again I know I'm not paying for 5 star service, but I could probably make the tacos I ordered faster in my own kitchen.  Especially when there are only 5 people in the whole restaurant. 

We finally got our food and started eating. Then an employee still in uniform starts noisily talking on his cell phone behind the counter about how \"I'm getting off work in about 10 minutes, blah blah blah, let's make our entire nights plans while being extremely rude to the customers\".  Can't this conversation wait until you are off work?! This was highly unprofessional... and annoying.

Aside from the aggravating customer service, the restaurant was clean and my tacos turned out decent. 

All in all, I would suggest using the drive though, at least then you have minimum contact with the extremely rude employees.  Or better yet, go to a different Taco Bell with pleasant employees."}
{"text":"This location is extremely busy at lunchtime, so if you go then, be prepared to wait awhile.  The employees are all very friendly and do a nice job of quickly getting through orders.  

The food has always been good and the store has always been relatively clean.  Everything is usually stocked and ready for the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this location to anyone.  The service is just disgraceful.  I have never been treated so badly in my whole life.  I don't even care what the food tastes like or that it is a fast food chain, no one should ever be treated that way.  My food was gross, poorly cooked and soggy.  Just do not ever go to this location, you will be sorry."}
{"text":"Whether you want to indulge in their soft/crunchy tacos, their sweet cinnamon twists, nachos or their freezes..  They have something here for everyone here.  Yeah its just a taco bell but when I get my food I'm in heaven. Taste like they make my food with love! The employees are also what make this location better than the rest..  I work in the Plaza and in the past they have remembered mine and my coworkers orders, now that's customer service!! And Gary that works there now is a really delightful person.  I'm grateful this location has good food and respectful employees!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Food quality is less than satisfactory. Store isn't very clean and bathroom was really bad. The floor is super sticky and doesn't appear to have been mopped recently. Staff was friendly enough but clearly do not listen. They got the order incorrect though promptly made it right. Watched the only other customer in the store stand at the counter for more than 5 minutes before even being acknowledged. There must be 5 employees in the back... Definitely wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Tried the roll up tacos. Well if you are looking for good and tasty,  don't bother. But if you are looking for something greasy and crunchy to soak up the alcohol you just drank, then stop here for some taquitos (rolled up tacos for gringos). Your stomach not thank you later. Neither will your toilet. And be prepared to wait in the drive through a while, so don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very nice people at this Taco Bell, Shane was the one who helped us and his service was really awesome. He is a very kind and thoughtful person.  Don't think I ever had a greater experience at any other Taco Bell. I would go out of my way to go to this location again."}
{"text":"I really like this Taco Bell and the customer service. They are friendly and nice. I wish I New the name of the young girl at the drive though. She was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great when compared to other taco bell locations.  Clean and fast. I mean what do you expect? This ain't no steak house. It's taco bell!"}
{"text":"Rudest bitches I've ever dealt with. Wouldn't give my nigga extra fire sauce. Fuck off"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell location (6275 McKee Road, Fitchburg, WI) is very clean and the people are super friendly.  The food is hot, fresh, nicely prepared, and tasty.  Bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Always gets my order right and is always fast about ans verg good customer service thanks guys"}
{"text":"Thank you I was treated good very good customer service but only one thing just clean the bathroom itis  disgusting when I walked in there  keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This location is one of the newer remodeled ones, very clean interior, comfy seats. 
I had my regular #10 with crunchy taco and a side of Nachos. Excellent! 
This location had a retirement aged man working the counter, he was very friendly to every customer and made small talk at the tables like we were at an actual restaurant. Very uncommon in upstate NY where I lived most of my life. 
Only thing I would change is the Soda machine, it's not their fault but Pepsi should have the multi dispenser like coca cola does...I love that machine. 
All in all good location, good food, and phenomenal service."}
{"text":"Quality Taco Bell. Food is always served hot, the drive thru employees are friendly and quick. I don't wait much longer than 5 minutes in line at the drive thru. Inside, they keep it clean. Haven't received a flat drink either. Overall it's a well managed Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Very rude staff no customer service skills what so ever I believe it was the manager when I was waiting in line totally bypassed me and went around out the door to check her sauce food is always cold through drive thru"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 1 AM. Music was being played loudly from someone's phone at the window and there was so much noise in the background the cashier missed half our order and the other half she got wrong. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"I know this is just Taco Bell but I come here all of the time and it's always a hit or a miss with customer service, the \"younger\" workers are always so pleasant and nice, whereas the \"older\" workers are so miserable and mean. A few months ago I went through drive through and I began ordering and one of the older ladies working was so rude to me ( I don't remember the whole conversations) I asked if I could speak to someone else. The other girl who helped me was extremely nice and friendly, she also apologized for her coworker and said she is just having a bad day. I brushed this encounter off because I understand we all have bad days, but this morning I went though drive through again and a different worker was extremely rude to me as well, so unfriendly . I know working at Taco Bell making probably minim wage in your late 30 s is probably not very ideal but it is no excuse to be rude to other people. You are there to work, you should be kind and friendly to people. Not have an I don't want to be here attitude . Super unpleasant experiences . But two stars because of all of the friendly staff I have encountered ."}
{"text":"Looked that fucker in the eye said no beans mother fucker  and guess what I still got beans in that burrito and they have changed this place around and skimp on the meat to make up the cost I got the number 11 supreme and they put a shit load of tomatoes hoping I wouldn't notice they had no fucking meat    I've been coming here since 1997   Never felt more ripped off fuck You Taco Bell I'll go to the del Taco for now on"}
{"text":"I got the big box. My food was hot and the order was correct to how I ordered it. The taste was 3/5, an average experience at Taco Bell. The people working were nice and made the experience good! Drive thru was fast and there were a decent number of people there which is why I would consider it a 4/5 because the workers obviously were doing a good job. 

I haven't been inside so I can't rate the inside in anyway. Would go back again though for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"This was great, very nice customer service.  They greeted everyone that comes in.  Marisa T. the cashier is great, smiling the whole time while taking my order.  I think every Taco Bell should like this store.  Polite and smiley faces."}
{"text":"I mean they make the food just fine, it's just the small things that dock them 2 stars. Waiting twenty minutes for three chalupas isn't acceptable. And going to the sauce box to find one mild sauce isn't too. 

The place isn't hard to find, its on the corner of windmill and vista palms, inside the vons plaza. You'll usually find teens just killing time there. Overall though the place is pretty clean. If they manage to keep the sauce box full on my next visit I'll bump it up a star."}
{"text":"They have really fast service and the food is always warm always friendly  I like the fact the manger personally takes the food to you and treats you awesome .  He also gave me a whole bunch of coupons"}
{"text":"The late night crew is amazing. Obviously it's the spot to go after a night of drinks and just want some food. The only problem is most of the time my order isn't exactly right. But they're at least nice when you roll through."}
{"text":"I love this Taco Bell. One time me and my sister went through the drive through and I dared her to say \" quesa-dill-a and the sweet boy at the window said Quesa-dill-a\" back. It was great. Now every time we see him we call him the \"quest-dill-a\" boy. He's great. Thx Taco Bell"}
{"text":"The Cosmic Trickster mucked with my life again. He made me come to a Taco Bell. 

I think he did it to remind me of why Mexican cuisine isn't something that can be nor should be successfully mass marketed. A truly tasty frozen burrito is an impossibility. 

This Taco Bell used to shovel out acceptably good grub. Everything was fresh, crispy when appropriate.

Today everything they make tastes as if it had been left in the rain for 2 hours. Don't do takeout, or else your food will lose whatever heat it contains in 5 minutes. Even the cardboard carryout containers will become as sodden as a rolled up newspaper that missed the porch and landed in a puddle. 

My mother who is about as Hispanic as Pat Buchanan makes Mexican food that is ten times as edible as anything you'll buy at a Taco Bell. 

Avoid it if possible. I was not so fortunate. The Cosmic Trickster was feeling ornery. My destiny is not my own."}
{"text":"Después de las cervezas, unos tacos para dormir. Nada del otro mundo. Lugar limpio, trato amable. Barato."}
{"text":"this Taco Bell absolutely sucks.... I don't know if management here is really crappy... Or they can't hire competent people... About a month ago we went to this Taco Bell and ordered about 10 maybe 12 things off the menu... I normally don't check my order because I expect there to be exactly how many things I ordered... We got home and opened up the bag and found out that they didn't include 4 
things of what we ordered...immediately I contacted the store... And they ask for me to come back and get all of the order... So we hopped in the car and went down there... We waited pretty decent amount of time I'd say 15 min..... The manager did fix the order... But this is not the first time this has happened... About six months before this incident... Me and my wife went down there again and ordered about eight items off the menu... Thank God we checked because as we're pulling out we noticed that two of the items were missing.... We went inside and told them and they demanded to see what was inside the bag... I gladly showed them and one of the employees had come out to my car to search our vehicle to make sure that we were hiding something... That's what really pissed me off... But I figured eh maybe they got new employees again and I went back... As I said they messed up on our order... The one in Painesville has never messed up our order yet so I'm constantly going there instead... I will be going to this particular location anytime soon... And I think you can understand why constantly forgetting people's orders is a bad sign that obviously you're not paying attention what you need to do... They have computer screens that shows them what is on the order and how much of those orders they need to fill... They need to seriously retrain these people or find competent people back and do the job correctly..."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is somewhat under the impression that there going to get over on me, not true. I told the person at the other end of the speaker to give me as much lettuce on my tacos as you can without charging  extra. Well I don't think they really thought about what I said because I am not satisfied with the 5 tacos I got. Now think about this taco supremes are 1.99, and there not really supreme their the way a taco should be anyway lettuce, cheese, tomato, shell, meat, supreme would be with pico de gallo. News flash 5 tacos for 10 bucks they better be bristling with lettuce...like the picture on the menu shows. That will be my primary defense when I go back and feel free to use that legal tactic on any restaurant any time you want to. The tacos are good but they can be better if they only wern't so stingy with the lettuce. Such a small price to pay for stardom."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday 8/23 around 6:20pm.  One other family was in the lobby so it wasn't busy.  Waited at the counter for about five minutes before being acknowledged.  We could hear the employees talking and laughing in the back.  The reason an employee finally came up was due to another customer at the receiving end of the counter, that complained about waiting for his order. Which they admitted to him was accidentally deleted.  We finally got our order in.  Went to get drinks and the floor mat and surrounding area were sticky.   After getting our food and eating, more customers came in and dealt with the sticky floor problem.  During our visit, two employees walked over it without a care in the world.  We saw one lady's flip
 flop come off of her foot because it was stuck on the floor.  Saw another customer complain about not getting their order in a timely manner.  Same problem as the earlier guy, deleted order!  Our food was fine, but the customer service and dining area were terrible.  I've been there many times in the past and I have never seen it this poorly maintained.  We will not be visiting this one again for quite some time.  Hopefully, they will get a manager and employees that have some pride in their job and in maintaining their establishment."}
{"text":"Taco's! I mean really it is a Taco Bell. Apparently they got an \"A\" from the health department on 6/27/2013...."}
{"text":"I love going to the Taco Bell but tonight was different I went through the drive through ordered my food and the guy never gave me the total amount so I drove up to the window then he asked for my money before I even knew how much to pay. Then when I got my 3 crunchy taco Supremes and paid for my food I never got my change I had to ask for it. I don't know who the guy was but he wasn't very focused on his work I never got a receipt with my food. And then when I opened  my 3 taco Supremes all they had was meat sour cream and cheese no lettuce or tomatoes pretty dissatisfying when you get less than you expected."}
{"text":"There's nothing terribly exciting about the establishment or it's food. However, my order has always been correct and the employees are friendly"}
{"text":"Taco Bell you really are nothing exciting, and your food is kind of gross, but there are a few items I like. And your two blocks away from the library which is nice and is great when I am too impatient to wait until I get home to eat.

Oh and thanks for keeping this location clean &sanitary. It's nice when people care for the appearance of their restaurant."}
{"text":"After placing an order through the app, which I've done numerous times, I went through the drive-thru and was told that they could not find any evidence of my order being placed in their system. Even though I had confirmation in the app and an email showing that I had placed an order I was asked to drive around and place it again. I expressed concern about being charged again but my question was not really acknowledged. So I place my order through the app once more and was told that they had no order in their system, even though I showed them my online confirmation and email. I pulled around and parked in the lot and went inside and ask to speak to the manager. I showed them once again confirmation of both orders and her response was there's nothing in our system. After a lengthy discussion and numerous back and forth between the app and my email showing that I placed an order and had been charged TWICE I was finally given the food without having to pay a third time. When I ask for a refund on the second charge I was told there was nothing they could do about it in the store since it was placed through the app. Even though it was their instructions for me to place the order a second time. This Taco Bell is only a block and a half from my house and I go there all the time and normally have no issues but was totally surprised by their inability to handle this obvious technical problem with their system and no protocol for dealing with such a problem even when I had verification on my phone. Oh by the way during the discussion another employee volunteered that they had been having trouble with their system receiving orders through the app. If you're having a problem with your system previous to my encounter why would you NOT have a procedure in place when it happens again? And why would you have a customer place an order through the app a second time so they can charge the second time and you not be able to cancel the second charge for them? The amount of the order wasn't a lot of money, only $9.44 but it's kind of the principle of the thing. And the fact that I now have to contact my bank to dispute the second charge on my card. VERY DISAPPOINTED TACO BELL!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a taco salad, as I was eating it, I almost cracked my tooth on a small rock or pebble. When I called to tell them, they said it was impossible and I must be mistaken. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great late night grub!! They got our order correct which was nice. I seem to always get screwed in the drive through. The only disappointing thing was the side of sour cream.. The side was under half full very disappointing... danm it guys!! Fill it up... it's not like the sour cream budget comes out of your pay!!!"}
{"text":"Comoletely disappointed with their lack of selection. From tacos to burritos they didnt have anything I wanted. Then kept yelling at me that they aren't a taco bell. Apparently this taco bell closed a few months back, and this place took a over. I may have been a little out of line, but no reason for the attitdue."}
{"text":"This store is taco bell and long john silver's.  We ordered from both menus and enjoyed both.  It was a fun treat for us since we do not live anywhere near a long johns. The food was very good the employees friendly and the restrauant clean! What more can one ask for"}
{"text":"This location is the worst. The employees never quite seem to know what they're doing and it always smells like sewer inside. I recommend finding another location nearby."}
{"text":"The Taco Bell on State St recently took the unusual step of closing for a month for renovations to incorporate a KFC into the same location. The new Taco Bell/KFC (or, as I've semi-affectionately dubbed it, \"Taco Cock\") is a very different beast from the familiar old Taco Bell; they completely gutted the place and put in all new furniture and decor in a completely new arrangement, and repainted the white walls a sort of dark red. The chairs features a bell-shaped cut-out, and the walls are plastered with pictures of the Colonel. 

This isn't two separate restaurants sharing seating space, either; there's just one counter to order at, and you can get any combination of burritos, tacos and fried chicken you want. My fiance and I usually order the half-pound beef & potato burrito at Taco Bell (cheap, filling, and about as close to healthy as you can get at a place like this), and on our most recent trip we supplemented it with an order of popcorn chicken with one of each dipping sauce (honey mustard, honey bbq, sweet & sour, and ranch -- all good, but we liked the honey mustard and ranch the best). The burritos were still the same as ever, and the chicken was surprisingly tasty -- so much so, in fact, that we went back for a second order.

Added bonus, \"Taco Cock\" is open 'til 3am, so if it's late at night and you don't have enough cash for Qdoba, or you want a burrito but your SO has his/her heart set on artery-clogging chicken, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and nice! The dinning room was clean and they had plenty of seating available for our group of seven. Bonus points for having vegan options! Give them a try if you are looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Stopped by cause the college age kids wanted a quick breakfast burrito.  The place looks relatively new and was clean.  The staff was friendly.  Having not been to a TB for years so was not sure what to expect.  They have a breakfast burrito for $1 that the kids like because it taste OK and is cheap. I decided to join in and found it to be OK but the tortilla was a little over cooked for my tasted.  Not sure how they heat it up but it was very brown on most of the shell, similar to being heated in a pan but for way to long."}
{"text":"I ordered two hard taco supremes with no lettuce and one soft taco supreme with no lettuce.

When I opened my tacos all three were not supreme and all three had shreds of lettuce still in the meat. (They obviously picked off the lettuce instead of making fresh)

So I paid for three supreme tacos with no lettuce (how hard is that)
And received three tacos that were picked through.

P.S. there was only one other customer in front of me. They were not busy!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit my family in Arizona, I make it a point to stop in here as the employees are friendly, the food comes fast and the dining room & restroom are always clean. My compliments especially for Courtney for a great customer service experience."}

{"text":"Hands down the worst Taco bell. This is unfortunately the only one on my way home. It is the slowest drive through I've ever been through. Went there tonight, got home and all the food was cold. I asked to sub beans for meat, extra cheese and no tomatoes. My food still had beef, hardly any cheese and covered in tomatoes. It's not this hard, guys"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's friggin Taco Bell. Garbage food that is great only when nothing else is open and you are at risk of withering away to death. If you are though, going to go to Taco Bell, go to this one. The older guy that runs through the drive through is awesome. He will either repeat the order back to you so incorrectly you'd wonder if you really did say 856 tacos and a side of grilled stuft burrito. Sometimes you pull up and he hands you a soda you didn't order, and says it's because you are the 1,000,000th customer. The guy is just out there, but you know what? he breaks the fast food mold and actually gives personality to a terrible establishment."}
{"text":"They don't value the customer.  I went around 6:20 PM this evening (a Tuesday).  No line at the counter, but there was one guy working both the counter and the drive-thru.  After waiting for him to finish with a drive-thru order, he acknowledged me and said he'd get to me.  I waited as he served 2 more drive-thru customers and decided this isn't worth the hassle so I left."}
{"text":"Lunch hour? Well not quite!  I expect my fast food to be fast.  I sat in the drive-thru for 15 minutes!  I assume it was due in part to the indecisive customers at the ordering window.

Once I got to the order speaker my order was efficiently taken"}
{"text":"Tracey is the best employee ever and showed a sense of commitment to her job and was extremely nice. Tracey, thank you for making my first Taco Bell experience very nice. What a wonderful employee."}
{"text":"This is one if the best Taco Bells. They have great customer service! Food has always been fresh. Today my order was messed up when I went through the drive thru and I didn't realize it until I was on the 15 and Sahara where I came to meet my lady for her break. I called I explained the situation to her manager and she immediately offered to fix the order. When I explained that I was on the other side of town she called the Taco Bell nearest me and asked them to place fix the order for me, in addition to she took my info and asked me to come back to her location and she would take additional care. By far the best customer service I have received from a fast food location!"}

You ask me what kind of sauce I wanted and I said mild medium and hot. Instead you just decided to go grab a handful of mild and a couple of hots, put it in the bag and onto the next one."}
{"text":"Came here tonight since I was craving the caramel empanada, starburst strawberry freeze, and chalupas.  Went through the drive tru and it was busy. Maybe because it was 930pm and it was St. Patrick's day, but I digress.  

The wait did take some time but it was understandable as there were only two people working the drive tru. They more than made up for it by throwing in two extra cool ranch Doritos tacos for waiting awhile.  I hope that they do hire more people and continue to keep up the wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Every thing was super tasty; my meal was perfect! The boy at the register, Gabriel, who helped me did a phenomenal job taking my order and making sure everything was perfect. 10/10 would come back! This store is in a super convenient location and the staff is super friendly and nice"}
{"text":"Love Taco Bell in general. However, Although food is good my order is ALWAYS wrong, always short on something when going through drive thru. I understand it's a fast food place but mistakes are highly consistent here. To ensure your orders are placed correctly and received accurately walk into the store and order from there. Customer service is always on point here though they never fight you on anything if an item was made wrong or forgotten. The correct it immediately and sincerely apologize."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell food. However, I hate this location, because although they make your food very quickly, it lacks quality. Also out of all the times I've been here, I've received my burritos undercooked and still cold about half the time. They do a great job of fixing their mistakes, but if they would take a few extra seconds, this mistake wouldn't happen as often."}
{"text":"This was my best experience At Taco Bell. It was worth the extra drive. The food ordered was served promptly and it was very good. I will be back."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a Taco Bell, so how bad can it be.  It's in a convenient location, especially for all of those Menards runs I get caught up in.  

I don't dine in much, but when I do it's just okay inside.  Not the cleanest Taco Bell I've been in, but like I said, it does the job.  The service is just okay too. I haven't had many botched orders here.

Compared to other Taco Bells in the Madison area, this one is truly a \"meh, I've experienced better\" rating.  I wouldn't NOT go here, but compared to others it lacks the cleanliness and level of customer service I'd rather have."}
{"text":"It's a good location on the west side, but it can also be tricky getting in and out of the parking lot.  Plan accordingly.  

They provide quick and friendly service.  The food was fresh and what you'd expect from any Taco Bell.

During busy times, the dining area can get a little unkept."}
{"text":"Two parts to this review.  

First, the store overall.  Very nice - the folks are quite pleasant and helpful.  Inside, it's well-kept and clean.  It's very convenient for me and an easy stop.  Very reliable for the standard Taco Bell fare when I have that hankerin'.

Next - their new \"breakfast\".  I had a waffle taco.  I *love* breakfast, so I was excited to try this.  Blech.  While it wasn't horrible, it is no threat to McDonalds.  The eggs were few and crumbly.  The sausage was okay.  The waffle was too maple-flavored and overpowered the rest of the ingredients (no need for the syrup).  Overall, a disappointment.  It would be alright in a pinch, but I'd cross a busy street if there were a McDonalds (or Burger King... or Hardees...etc.) as an alternative."}
{"text":"I love this location, when I had order my food, I thought I had it right but the manger had explained my order which I completely understood. I was going to leave with the food I had got from the start but the manger still made my food the way I wanted even though they don't it. Thank you for that. The night seems fun and the manger is definitely a team player."}
{"text":"I eat here embarassingly often. I'm talking 5-10x a year or more ! .. I'd like to say I'm drunk everytime I eat here, but like Veronica I eat here sober as well! I haven't gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell and they haven't screwed up my order very many times either. I always do the drive through, but so far so good ! The Beefy Cheesy Burrito for .99 with the rice and sour cream they are serving right now is my kryptonite. Damn you Taco Bell and your cheap crave-worthy eats."}
{"text":"I would give it a 0, but you have to select at least 1 star! The Manager and lady behind the counter was rude! The lady behind the counter didn't know what she was doing for her job! They had bad customer service and didn't refund me for the negative experience, drive to another Taco Bell, for this place is run my garbage employees!"}
{"text":"I came to this Taco Bell at 6:53 pm was in a hurry to get home so decided fast food was the way to go. I pulled up through the drive-thru and ordered 2 combos, and 2 churros. Pulled up to the window and paid. Pulled up to the second window recieved my 2 drinks then got asked to pull up and park and my order would be right out. Which wasn't a problem I parked and waited. 5 min went by then 10 and then 15. After waiting for almost 20 min I got out of my car and walked into the Taco Bell, my order still had not been brought out. I was upset but simply wanted my money back and to drive across the street to the jack in the box. I hand the woman my receipt and ask for my money back. A manager comes over and asked what the problem was I explained the situation he asked another employee why my order had been placed on park and told no one about it she simply said \"oh my bad\" he then gives me my $16 back no apology and offers a free churro. I Refused the free churro and walked out. Not upset that I was outside waiting for my order for 20 min. Just disappointed in the lack of customer service NEVER will I be coming back to this Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Not sure what is with this place but it really isn't fast food. The only time i remember the place not being as slow as molasses was a late night visit 10+ years ago and that time i probably just didnt notice because i had a few drinks. Maybe they are slaughtering the dogs and cats inside instead of off site like other TBs."}
{"text":"I looove taco bell so much!! My favorite is the Mexican pizza!


Edit: Funny how some reviews get deleted if it wasn't based on an actual dining experience but this hasn't gotten flagged."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell for sure!  The staff is usually friendly, I am usually surprised by this fast food staff.  They seem to be happy at this location and it shows in the service and food.  I never had missing items, extra sauce, and napkins, etc.  Food is hot and staff is friendly.  
I applaud the manager at this location, he/she run a great group of customer friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very clean. Quality food. Good service. Good atmosphere. Staff was very fast and professional. After being on a plane for hours. And all that entails. This place appeared out of the darkness and saved the day. I have to recommend it. And Taco Bell is usually quality. But it was actually pleasant."}
{"text":"Drive thru is appalling there is a senior age man that looks filthy nails hands and clothes are dirty. He then proceeds to touch his face and nose waiting to bag your food and then the cherry on top... He licked his fingers to grab napkins to put in my bag. I have officially sworn off fast food after witnessing what I did today."}
{"text":"They were great when they first opened, and have gone downhill recently. Tonight, Sunday 10/9/2016 at 8pm, I went through the drive through and ordered a Gordita Crunch big box and upgraded the taco to a supreme, and ordered a second taco supreme to go with it. I asked that they make sure that the supremes and burrito had sour cream as the last two time they didn't put ANY in. I was charged accordingly for the extra taco, and my drink was a sweet tea. The guy at the window handed me the box, and then handed me the tea. The top wasn't on tight and as he put it to my window it fell into my lap and tea and ice went everywhere. In my lap, the door, the seat, the floor, the dash board....every where. I pulled into a parking space and got the ice out but the tea was soaked in everywhere including my pants. They gave me another tea. When I got home I sat in my recliner and opened the box. Right off they had forgotten the extra taco supreme I'd paid for. When I unwrapped the gordita crunchwrap the tomatoes, lettuce and cheese immediately dumped into my lap. I didn't bother to go back and get the other taco for fear something else would happen. Until they drug test these idiots I'm NOT going back.!!"}
{"text":"For a store that is open 24 hours per day, seven days per week all year long, I would expect to get some less than excited service at least once in a while. It never happens. They deal with drunks every night and I have never felt like my service was anything less than great.  I've probably been there 40 times in the past five years"}
{"text":"#DTCCR SUCKS. I'm only giving it 2 stars, because my GF prefers TB to DT, otherwise it would be ONE STAR.

My personal disdain for this particular one comes from the horrible drive-thru correct completion ratio (#DTCCR). They have gotten our order correct MAYBE 5% of the time, with a statistically significant number of visits. REALLY.

Tonights order 4 items= 2 Taco Salads-minus rice. One Pintos Cheese w/ green not red sauce. Steak Enchirito. 2 Drinks.

Salads came thru window fast, and intact (no rice - yay!). 2 drinks followed, with one straw (boo). Second bag was pulled before coming thru window because it contained a large number of items (car behind us?). Second bag came thru - pintos, check. Enchirito, check.

Got home - pintos with green? Nope. Red. Enchirito steak? Negative Ghost Rider. 

6 items+2 straws = 8 things to hand us. 2 of them wrong, and no straw. 5 outta 8 just isn't a good percentage. Bonus points for window girl for realizing she had wrong bag and grabbing 2nd bag \"on the fly\". Negative points for substituting incorrect items for other incorrect items. 

It's just not worth it to call these places back and complain, or drive back, and they know it. I can't stress enough - when at this drive-thru DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ORDER for CORRECT ITEMS - not just number of items."}
{"text":"Drive thru takes longer than forever, and Jesus himself would bow down in the event of a miracle that the order comes up correctly and you don't have to get back in the only line longer than Time Warner Cable's customer service phone line."}
{"text":"Under staffed during lunch hour.  3 bean burritos shouldn't take 25 minutes to make.  Cashier had pissed off look the entire visit.  I'll make sure to avoid this location at any cost"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is usually pretty good about getting the order right. My treason for 4 stars instead of 5 is... I had about 5 items and they only gave 1 packet of hot sauce. I just don't get that. The food is hot, all items were made correctly, with other locations, that can go either way sometimes."}
{"text":"Ssssslooooow but always delicious! :-P When they re-open the dining room I'll have to check it out and update"}
{"text":"After looking at previous reviews I think everyone nailed it. This is probably the worst Taco Bell I've been too. Service extremely slow for three tacos. 15 minutes and I'm still waiting. Very disappointed in the customer service. If you have a manager on duty and they can't run the place any better than this maybe you need to change management. Just saying.  I probably won't revisit this location again."}
{"text":"This is the slowest and nastiest Taco Bell I have ever been too! The employees are not friendly. I would recommend going to another one if available!"}
{"text":"They forgot one of my tacos in the chalupa meal :/ oh well. But those new steak flat breads are my new favorite thing!"}
{"text":"Well I hate to write this but I have to. Went to the drive through and ordered several tacos and a 1 piece fish and 2 planks dinner. We were told to pull to the lot and they would bring out our food...15 minutes later we get the food and the man says it was just made nice and hot, I thanked him and drove home. We sat down to eat and my chicken was Raw, and yes I bit into it, Yuk!!! The other piece was cooked but I was so taken back completely lost my appetite! Now mind you I waited 15 minutes for this raw chicken! I drove back and asked to speak with the mgr. she was so nonchalant,  I brought it with me clearly pink inside not a big deal I guess. I said would you please take this and show it to the cook you really don't want to serve raw poultry. She said ok. I mean come on act concerned a little at least? She wrote my name in a book for a free meal (fish only)! but what concerns me was her attitude. I used to own a restaurant and that is the last thing you want to have happen to a customer! I didn't drive all the way back for free fish! I thought I would get a thank you for bringing this to our attention and we will make an effort that it doesn't happen again or something? Oh my what's wrong with people...is that my stomach gurgling???"}
{"text":"Well; my 3 children, my wife, and me all have food poisoning. It was definitely Taco Bell, because we normally don't eat the same food since I am always busy and what not. This is the one thing in over a week that we had as a family. It's not the first time that their quality has concerned me. Other times it was dried out beans (that seemed like they sat for a while) but this time we got sick. This means NO MORE TACO BELL FOR MY FAMILY! I guess as far as health is concerned it was for the best in the long run, but they really don't take food safety seriously (obviously). Which is sad.

This used to be a good location a year or so back when it was new, but it seems as though their care for food has gone downhill. I get that the workers aren't paid well, and it's hard to care when that's the case...but when working with food you gotta think that you may get a 2 year old very sick (which they did)."}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating staff, convenient location, and fast service. Food was made to order."}
{"text":"Great location, fast service and the employee I dealt with was friendly and quick. Food was made to order and tasted like it was supposed to."}
{"text":"Your standard Taco Bell location. They are open late and the closest location. They never fail to deliver exactly what you expect off the menu. You can count on them to satisfy your craving. Its gets very annoying when you get sub-par, fail-quality fast food when you already know youre ordering crap.

Gotta love their Dorito Tacos and Chalupas. Delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and WiFi... Unfortunately, WiFi didn't work, and management doesn't care. 

Spent $7, which is okay for a fast-food lunch. The cashier was friendly, and the chicken power bowl was decent enough, albeit a little bland. 

The reason for the one star is the tall, older man who works here. I finished my meal, searched for WiFi, and the system showed that the router should be reset. I very quietly packed up my bag, since I hadn't seen one employee in the dining room or at the counter since I'd arrived. As I approached the exit, I saw the man... I asked him if he was the manager, and he said I can help you. 

I asked about the WiFi, and he shrugged. I nicely said, \"You do have public WiFi, right?\" He shrugged again. I said, \"Well, the error I'm receiving is that the router needs to be reset.\" I'm used to this, since I travel A LOT, and many places do just that: reset the router. 

He shrugged again, \"Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.\"

I pressed on, still nicely, even though I was getting frustrated, \"But, Sir, now I have to go somewhere else, and spend more money, after I just spent $7, just so I can use the WiFi for a few minutes to finish a contract.\"

He shrugged and walked off. 

Sigh!!! I really don't know what's become of the restaurant Industry. You SHOULD care about the customer, no matter how silly their issue. And even if you don't, you could at least ACT like you care. A simple \"sorry\" goes a long way."}
{"text":"It has now been almost 11 minutes and two cars in front of me and I have plenty of time to write this review on how slow the drive-through is. Trying to come here for a quick bite during lunch now I'm gonna be late going back to work."}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive thru ever! I've been waiting 15 minutes and I haven't even ordered yet. I don't think I'll get my food for another 25 minutes! The guy at the drive thru joked with me saying they were out of the item I wanted. With a place that jokes around AND is slow I'm not sure I'll ever be back. Are there actually any FAST food restaurants in Charlotte besides Chic Fil A?"}
{"text":"Stopped here because I finally had to try the Doritos Locos Tacos.  It's been hyped up for so long I just haven't got around to trying it, and today was the day.  I ordered two regular, the guy at the drive through was super nice, seemed like the manager or something, dress shirt and tie and all.  I wasn't expecting restaurant quality food, knowing it is a fast food chain, but the Doritos Locos Tacos weren't that good.  I don't know if the shells were stale, but the Doritos flavor just wasn't there.  I guess I expected them to be exactly like Doritos but they're not.  Not as cheesy and they're thinner.  Maybe it was just stale taco shells, but I'll probably give them another try, maybe at a different location.  Or maybe just make a taco salad of my own with Doritos. YUM!"}
{"text":"Been through the drive thru with my dogs a few times now. Grabbed a Double Decker Taco (no lettuce) and a Mountain Dew for a quick Christmas Eve lunch. The guy at the window was very festive with his Santa hat and wished me a Merry Christmas. Next time I want another taco, burrito, quesadilla, or nachos, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru for a late night snack. I got a Cheesy Potato Burrito. It was piping hot and still warm by the time I got home. It was tasty. Nice job, Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a quick bite after a long day of travel. It was about 8:45pm and there didn't appear to be any other customers there. Don't think I had eaten at this location before tonight. I usually go to the one on McDowell. I got the cheesy potato burrito and ordered a few items from the dollar menu that my boyfriend wanted to try. Only took about a minute to get the food and I was on my way. When I got home, the burrito was still warm and tasted good. Lots of beef in there. It didn't look very big, but it was filling. My b/f said the mini shredded chicken quesadilla was good. Taco Bell isn't the greatest quality pseudo-Mexican food around, but where else can 2 people get dinner for 6 bucks?"}
{"text":"Decided to try this Taco Bell for the first time. When we walked in, I smelled a very strong iron smell, like blood or loose change. We should have turned and walked out then. My boyfriend wanted to try the crispy chicken quesadilla but the cashier said they didn't have that \"no more.\" He decided on the chicken \"doubledilla\" instead. I got a bean burrito (no sauce or onion) and cheesy fiesta potatoes. My burrito was fine but the fiesta potatoes were crunchy and tasted kind of old, like they had been sitting out awhile. 1 slice of my boyfriend's \"doubledilla\" was just plain tortilla! No meat or cheese in it. And the rest of it was a thin layer of cheese and very little meat. My standards for Taco Bell are relatively low, but somehow they still managed to disappoint."}
{"text":"Ordered a Double Decker Taco (no lettuce), Nachos Bell Grande (no tomato), and a drink. When our food came out, I saw that there was lettuce on my taco. Brought it back up to the counter. They said they'd make me a new one. When they set it down on the tray, I saw that it was a regular taco without lettuce. It was supposed to be a Double Decker. They said they'd remake it. Brought out a new one to our table along with cinnamon twists for the trouble. Unwrapped the taco to find that it had some kind of white sauce on it... No! It's supposed to be a Double Decker Taco with meat & cheese only! OMG. I was just laughing because we had 3 failed tacos sitting on the table. Unbelievable. Finally I got the right thing, but it took a little while because their drive thru got busy. Only then did I start to question whether my Nachos Bell Grande was actually the smaller Nachos Supreme, but at that point I didn't care. And for the umpteenth time I asked myself, \"And these people want $15 an hour??\""}
{"text":"I was thinking about XXL Nachos and went to Taco Bell. I got there only to find the XXL Nachos have gone away! Boo. Next best thing, Nachos Bell Grande (no tomatoes) to share with my friend and a Cheesy Potato Burrito. While waiting for our food, I tried a couple of beverages. Mtn Dew Sangrita... didn't care for it. And Brisk Lemonade Tea... also not great. So I ended up with Pepsi. But even that didn't taste right. It wasn't sweet as Pepsi should be... Not sure what's up with their fountain drinks.
When the food came out, we found that my friend was shorted a soft taco. He went back up to get it and they ended up giving him an extra one. My burrito and nachos tasted as they should. Nothing amazing, they simply met my expectations. Wish they still had the XXL Nachos though..."}
{"text":"Just an update..  This Taco Bell is still the best..  I mean, as far as Taco Bell goes..  Tortillas were very soft and fresh, almost like they were bought locally..  The staff was very friendly.  My order was done quickly, and everything tasted as good as taco bell can make it.."}
{"text":"With 580 calories (per tacobell.com) and at ~5 USD for a steak Cantina bowl, this bowl consisted of a bit of romaine lettuce sitting on top of rice, bean, corn and very sad looking brown pieces of steak dressed in an avocado tomatillo dressing. You are MUCH better off going a little farther down the road to Chipotle and get a steak bowl there, with ~650 calories and a dollar more, you'd get much fresher ingredients and deliciousness. I wouldn't recommend Taco Bell's Cantina bowl to anyone who has any bud tastes at all."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas, me and my husband were eating at this Taco Bell at least once a week. The employees recognized us and had memorized our usual orders down to my request that my burrito be grilled. Yup, we have a problem. But I can't help it - I love Taco Bell. Out of all the fast food chains, Taco Bell is probably the most vegetarian friendly IMO. I'm loving the new cheesy rice and bean burrito for $1 and the spicy potato soft taco, also for $1. Where else can two people eat for $7? Taco Bell love aside, this location is always clean and the employees are super friendly. I will maintain that this particular Taco Bell is the best in town (until proven otherwise). My Taco Bell is better than yous :P jk

{"text":"Most enthusiastic Taco Bell people ever.   Usually when you go through the drive through its \"what can I get you and here's your total\".  But not here.  Energetic and always with a smile."}
{"text":"Dear manager of this Taco Bell...you suck. Stop subjecting your employees to the ridicule and rudeness from customers wanting more than one hot sauce packet. Yes, I was told when I wanted more sauce packets, that I could only get one by order of management. I doubt you're saving that much money on giving me one more. I'd like to see you come out and tell your customers and disappointing them. Also, I walked in and dumped the whole bin of sauce packets into my bag...and didn't even want that many. Your employees are always very nice,  but you get one star because you're a terrible manager."}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 stars I definitely would!!!!!! Do not got to this location after 12am. I can promise you from 12am-2am closing time they're in there partying blasting music and not making fresh meals . I've went here 3 times late because I work a late shift , I don't get off work until 11:30pm and just wanted some good tacos but i definitely got the opposite . Food was cold and  nasty !!! I went back the next morning and complained and they didn't do anything not even an apology. I also went back late at night and complained and the lady at the drive thru said \" I didn't work the other night\" they don't care about there customers at all ..!!!!"}
{"text":"American Taco Bells are light years ahead of Canadian ones in terms of quality, variety, and value. For under $9 including tax, got two cheesy potato burritos, 3-layer nachos, beefy fritos burrito, and an apple empanada. Everything was freshly made (although I've had even fresher, like piping hot \"they just killed the cow\" fresher). The cashier was friendly with a big smile but she seemed to be beefing (yeah, I went there) with a customer and sarcastically said \"thank you\" at her. Lots of parking at this location as it's part of a bigger plaza."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this Taco Bell. They take forever and you can't pull out of their drive thru. We were once trapped in the drive thru for an hour and a half despite only having three cars ahead of us ordering at the speaker. It used to be the closest to my house so when we wanted Taco Bell but weren't feeling like being seen, we'd literally sit and watch the Office while waiting in the drive thru. Sometimes the workers at the window will give you free things if you're waiting too long. We've acquired two tacos, cinnamon twists, and about five drinks in our multiple times of going here throughout the past two-ish years and waiting too long. The positive experiences are the occasional funny workers and the nice staff members that compensate with free items. The negative experiences are being trapped in the drive thru without any way out when we've changed our mind since it's taking too long."}
{"text":"This review is all about the customer service I received today at Taco Bell! Meya J I believe is the women's name who helped me today, she was absolutely amazing! She made my boyfriend and I laugh the whole time we were ordering & she was so personable! I have never received such good customer service ordering fast food, or in the food industry ever. She made me want to come back to Taco Bell just because of her & I haven't even eaten my food yet!"}
{"text":"I quit going to this location because I have received such bad service in the past. Tonight I decided to give this location another chance and Im glad I did. The service was so great and friendly compared to most fast food restaurants. The food was like any normal taco bell but they really have seemed to step up there game."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell was out of beans and chicken (for the meat eaters out there). The inside was closed, so I drove through the drive thru and had to wait behind other customers which was very inconsiderate. Had the inside been opened, I am still uncertain that I would have gone inside to order/eat due to obvious reasons. The fact that a Taco Bell was out of beans and meat (once again for the meat eaters out there), showed proof that this Taco Bell was filled with bad vibes. Had my friend been there with me I'd have asked her if she could do a tarot card reading just to prove my point. Never go to this Taco Bell without the proper counter curses."}
{"text":"Awful service, the food sucks and they always forget to give you silverware and napkins which defeats the whole purpose of the drive thru cause you still have to go in."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Taco Bell I've ever been to. I just got a burrito bowl that was 95%lettuce. Every time I've come here, my order has been wrong and I'm not exaggeratingI work very close to here and I love Taco Bell, but I will NEVER order another thing from this place ever again."}
{"text":"They take forever and almost ALWAYS get my order wrong. I've been in the line for 20 minutes- HAVEN'T EVEN PAID YET..."}
{"text":"Food always ready and fast. For that ever reson.They forgot my order hand had to re order my Brina out the windo
 Had to.wait  for them to fix there mistake very rude."}
{"text":"The food was cooked fast and the cashier was friendly . It's fast food people not a 5 star restaurant. Stop having such high expectations lol"}
{"text":"Okay, normally I would never write a review of a fast food place...I just don't think it is fair.  However, I will make an exception for this Taco Bell for one reason only.  The woman that works the drive through is the friendliest and nicest fast food employee that I have ever come across.  Maybe she's just new, but for the last few weeks when I am coming home late, I have made a stop there, and she's always smiling.

People that work jobs like this normally don't have the brightest dispositions, and who can blame them?  I guarantee that their customer base doesn't treat them well.  Service industry workers deserve much more respect than we give them, so here is your 5 star review Taco Bell on West 150th.  Keep up the good work.

...I feel like there should be a Bud Light Real Men of Genius soundtrack going on behind this review right now..."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, waited 40 minutes for my meal.   Soda tasted nasty.   Need to fire the manager, the only one working hard was the cashier.   Can't deal with this bad of service don't come here."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has been consistently good. I've been taking my kids for chili-cheese burritos and chicken quesadillas for a couple years. So they're hooked on Taco Bell now.

I'm kind of hooked on the chicken quesarito. I'll eat any quesarito, but the chicken has just the right amount of spice. If I eat two of them, I'm full and content...until my next visit.

Looking forward to the upscale Cantina location near my work downtown!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Taco Bell with my son and my nephew. There was no line, so we were able to order immediately. I ordered two chicken quesaritos and a Mountain Dew. My son and nephew ordered plain tacos and nachos. The food was hot and ready in under five minutes. My quesaritos were hot and delicious, as hoped. The Mountain Dew was mixed correctly and we had an enjoyable meal.  The restaurant was clean. What more can you ask for?

We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Taco Bell countless times since it moved from Pearl and Ridge years ago. Most of the food I've had has been made well and my orders were correct. My current favorite menu item is the chicken quesarito. It's spicy, cheesy, and delicious. It has rice, chicken, and cheese sauce. I love them and I could eat them every day with a Mountain Dew. 

My previous favorite menu item is the chilito, aka, chili-cheese-burrito. Workers act like they don't know what a chilito is.

Service can be slow late at night.

I'm getting too old to eat this stuff!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Taco Bell for lunch and upon viewing the menu, I noticed some new Carnitas or Cantina Tacos as they call them.  They looked great based on the picture.  However, when I tasted them, they were really bad.  

First, they used two new soft shells to wrap them in.  I don't know where they got these new shells that are only used for the Carnitas, but they don't work.  There were two shells wrapped around them and I soon found out why.  The Carnitas fall apart quickly, so they wrap an additional shell around them in a futile effort to keep the contraption in one piece...it doesn't work.

Second, they are tiny.  For $1.49, I would expect something bigger than a $0.79 taco.  Wouldn't you?.  The Carnitas are the smallest thing I've ever eaten, besides a cinnamon twist.  You can order three Carnitas plus a drink for $4.99, which I did.  I tried the chicken, the pork and the steak.  

I held one of my wimpy Carnitas up in the air and glanced at the picture immediately to my right.  It was a picture of what a Carnita is supposed to look like - one layer of soft, durable shell (I received two), lots of meat (I received almost none), and onions (I did not detect any).

Third, the texture and flavor of these new Carnita shells is extremely disappointing.  I almost couldn't finish eating them!  They were that bad and I'm not a picky eater, usually.  The shells were disgustingly moist for some reason and they came apart easily with the smallest bit of meat inside.  If you add in the fact that there were two shells, the bad flavor and texture was a double-whammy.

Fourth, flavor.  What flavor?   Flavor is the furthest thing from these soft taco shells.  If flavor was the north pole, the new Carnita soft shells are Saturn's rings!

Upon dumping the contents of my tray in the trash, I politely warned the patrons in line to skip the Carnitas.  Do not eat these!

This restaurant was my standard lunch hole during my college years and I have never been disappointed until now."}
{"text":"I stopped by Taco Bell to get some fast grub to satiate my hunger while fixing some computers nearby. I ordered a chicken Quesarito and a beef Quesarito. They were served quickly, in a friendly manner, and the beef Quesarito was delicious. I noticed on the chicken Quesarito that there was a salty, orange colored crust on some of the meat. I didn't think anything of it. I finished up my computer work and a couple hours later, I had the worst stomach ache. I wonder if it came from the mysterious salty orange stuff in my chicken Quesarito. The world will never know, but certainly, the bad stomach ache came from this meal. This substandard meal didn't destroy my iron stomach, but it did destroy my toilet!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is one fast food joint where I'll eat anything on the menu and think it's good.  I love this place.  You know, I didn't eat here until I was 11 years old.  Thanks, mom!

Taco Bell has recently abandoned two of the shops in my neighborhood simply to rebuild down the street.  Weird, but okay by me.  Now there are two abandoned, classic Taco Bell buildings that no one wants.  Reminds me of a redheaded stepchild.  Burger King and McDonald's demolished their aging stores and rebuilt on-site...not sure why Taco Bell didn't do the same.

Taco Bell is offering shrimp on its tacos now.  I'm not sure that's a great idea.  I mean, beef doesn't have to be cooked all the way, so that's why people haven't died eating at Taco Bell yet.  But I don't trust the carefree employees to cook shrimp for me.  That's one menu item I'll pass on.  Taco Bell + shrimp = lawsuit waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Should have realized it was gonna be a bad experience by the amount of STAR this place has...I just tried calling & they purposely hung up on me! 

I was the only customer so WTF! Why is it that when I get home is when I find out they forgot my nacho cheese & chips . It seems so minor but that's all I was looking forward to & I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they got my order correct but then again they seemed so rushed to hand me my bag that I should have known. You guys suck. It's nice to know that you gladly charge me for what's not in my bag! I wish I could post this with no stars."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is disgusting the food was cold the customer service is poor the workers there don't care there's always something disgusting inside the food like they intentionally spit my food one of the employees before asked me how my food taste I got so mad and I left Taco Bell I try to ask for my refund they would not refund it they called the police on me I told them I'm trying to get my refund I told the police officer he said he spit my food that's why I got mad I told him I asked the employee give me my money back the food was not eaten because of what he said to me everybody don't trust this Taco Bell at 16th St. and Bethany Taco Bell it's the worst they don't use gloves they pick their nose when they're making food it is really disgusting if you don't believe me just check it out thank you the health department needs to be inspecting them just because the place looks pretty doesn't mean people are clean they pick their nose they don't use gloves making food it's absolutely horrible disgusting food the worst Taco Bell in the world the employees do not care about anybody they dog everybody's food. And still peoples money I never got my refund for that food"}
{"text":"I ignored the reviews and I regret it this Taco Bell is so damn bad that it doesn't even taste like Taco Bell!!! It was more like old cold jack in the box tacos! Maybe even worse!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this specific Taco Bell many times before. The service is excellent, the staff are friendly, and they have never messed up an order! You can really tell that the employees here are not mad or rude like you often see at fast food joints, and are simply pleased to serve their customers

As far as their drive thrus are concerned, I have used their drive thru before and I haven't had the lengthy wait times many have complained about, but I guess I could have just gotten lucky!

Overall, if you live in the CU area, this is definitely one of the better Taco Bells to visit!"}
{"text":"This really isn't about the food.. Taco Bell is what it is but dude man working the window tonight at 8:30 was so nice and positive that it redeemed my faith in humanity. He is the real MVP, and if he's not management yet he should be. My receipt says his name is Tyrann. He also helped me make sure there wasn't meat in anything I ordered- I rarely go to Taco Bell because I'm vegetarian and I thought it was cool that he helped me out instead of being annoyed by my dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I realize that this is a chain restaurant but out of all the locations I've gone to, Streetsboro offers the best customer service by far! They always get my order right, it is always clean  & the food kills any late midnight cravings one might have. Always a pleasant experience :)"}
{"text":"Employees are not only rude to the staff, but to their coworkers! I don't know a lot of Spanish, but even I could tell they were badmouthing a trainee. Unacceptable. Needs a complete employee wipe!"}
{"text":"There is nothing in this world greater than Taco Bell. I get food from here at least once a week. The only thing I hate about it is that it is so far from my house. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm yelping a fast food place lol I was bored I guess. One of my guilty pleasures is a weekly taco bell smashing. And typically it's just taco bell, cold, slapped together, cheap. I have been to this taco bell a few times, every time I'm blown away by the quality. It is always hot, loaded with meat. Yes it's still taco bell lol but probably the best one I know of."}
{"text":"Cheyenne at this location was absolutely amazing!! She was so sweet and fun and you can tell she actually really cares about the concerns and happiness of the customer. I was having a really bad day and was crying when I pulled up to the window and the moment she saw me and started talking to me with such a positive attitude it completely changed my mood!! Amazing customer service and someone should really consider giving that girl a raise."}
{"text":"I was stuck in the drive thru line for exactly 28 minutes to get my toddler a $1 mini quesadilla... 28 mins trapped between the car in front of me & behind me, all of us talking through our car windows to provide patience and support to each other. When I finally get to the window, my toddler now asleep, I mentioned the wait time and all the employee said to me in return was \"We are short staffed, there's nothing I can do about it!\" umm, how about comp my mini quesadilla? Or even just a coupon? Nope, nothing. I paid for my order and also paid for the poor dude's nacho fries behind me because we'd be through a lot together at this point. 

Worst part is, my kid didn't even eat the nasty quesadilla when we got home."}
{"text":"I was visiting Home Depot and went to Taco Bell as they are next to each other.  I waled to the counter to order and saw 5-6 employees taking care of drive through customers.  

There was a Taco Bell management meeting in the lobby with 5-6 other people having a planning meeting.  Unfortunately, there was no one to take my order.  I would give the rating a 1-star except for an employee from the back contacted the person who was supposed to be working the counter.  The person that came to take my order was obviously a trainee and did not know how to enter my order.  That explains why he was hiding in the back.

It was not a good experience.  I live near this Taco Bell location and will not be back anytime soon.  It was really a case of poor store management to leave a shy trainee in charge of taking customer orders."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, but this is easily the worst one I've ever been to. It took 20 minutes for me to get my food through the Drive-Thru. I would give it no stars, but I can't. Awful! Clearly needs new workers/management."}
{"text":"Used to like this location but after tonight will not be back. I refuse to give money to businesses with poor customer service. The manager is rude and unconcerned with fixing their mistakes. Please fire this unprofessional sorry excuse of a manager."}
{"text":"This place almost kicked me out because I was trying to take a picture of my friend inside the restaurant. Then, they got my order wrong. The food is also garbage. I mean, c'mon now. I'd rather go to any of the 'Bertos in the area, but I'm broke sometimes."}
{"text":"Just had the free biscuit taco that they were giving out today. What I got, far exceeded my expectations. I was expecting an \"egg\" patty with some nacho cheese inside a stale \"biscuit\". What I got was eggs that resembled real eggs in both taste and texture and cheese that also resembled real cheese in both taste and texture! What a surprise! The biscuit was soft and pillowy. Who'd a thunk.....edible biscuit taco?"}
{"text":"The soda dispenser was not working. The fish was flat, like it had been in the warmer far too long. My friend said the burrito had no spice. We were very disappointed. And there was no iced tea."}
{"text":"Just spent $25 and all our taco shells were rancid! They made my taco salad twice and each time the taco bowl was rancid. I told them the shells must stay on the shelves for a while.  The manager says\" oh no, we make the bowls fresh every morning\". BS! They are delivered pre made, I know that for a fact. The nacho chips, taco shells all tasted old, stale and rancid, the best way I can describe it is if you eat a bad sunflower seed. I hate wasting $$ on gross food!!"}
{"text":"This location's night crew is amazing, as a vegan it is always nerve racking when you get off of work late and the only places open are fast food joints who dont exactly specialize in plant based cuisine.  

I have actually not been to a Taco Bell since I made this dramatic lifestyle change for two reasons, out of fear that the staff would not be knowledgeable about my dietary restrictions or that i would be a massive inconvenience.

Now, I have been to this location twice and drove thru, the staff was knowledgeable about what ingredients I can not eat and found creative ways to add value to my meal since i wasn't getting cheese, meat or sour cream.

Take care of these employees they are the reason I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I realize this is fast food, but it's a international chain & should have some customer service. I went inside for the 1st time (usually use the drive thru) & what a disappointment!!! There was nobody in line, yet I waited for almost 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me the whole time listening to them gossip (including manager!!!) Then after ordering, it took another 17 mins for my food to arrive... What's happened to FAST FOOD?!? Between the rude employees & long wait times I will NEVER return!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Hell Ever.  All I have to say. Avoid at all cost.  0 stars!"}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell, so don't expect more than that. I have eaten at this location more than any other over a span of several years. The people have been consistently friendly and helpful, both in the restaurant and at the drive-through. I don't recall ever having my order messed up, and the place is pretty clean. Again, it is a Taco Bell, so I assume your expectations are reasonable."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Taco Bell.  Only problem is they forgot an item from my order which I paid for.  What am I gonna do, drive back down there and say where my slider?"}
{"text":"This location is a major disappointment. Today they forgot my order of cheesy fiesta potatoes, didn't provide napkins, and sloppily prepared the rest of my order. The staff employee at this location was also very rude when the mistake was brought to her attention. No apology whatsoever. The location on Val Vista and Baseline is worth the few extra minutes of travel time because they take orders accurately, are friendly, and their food tastes better."}
{"text":"Was pretty hungry Saturday and decided to visit this location for some yummy tacos. The outside of the building looks so old! It reminded me of visiting Taco Bell in the 90's. What a blast from the past! We went through the drive thru. The parking lot is very small so drive cautiously pulling in and out. They were fairly busy with many cars in drive thru and on the front line counter also. Someone on the front line had ordered quite a few boxes of the family meals and we were watching the crew work hard filling the orders. The employee apologized for the wait and was very friendly. The food was like most other Taco Bells. It filled our stomachs. 

Pros
*Friendly Employees
*Neat Old School Location

Cons
*Small/Tight Parking Lot
*Gets very busy"}
{"text":"The \"manager\" Claudia is rude, we ordered a box of tacos some were supposed to be Doritos tacos and they weren't. We called and talked to an employee who told us to bring in the receipt, we asked do we bring the food back that was made wrong (cameron?) He said no just the receipt. We get there and the manager flips out because we don't have the food they made wrong. She starts yelling at the employee and saying I don't give out free food, we weren't asking for free food moron! She then walks around shaking her head and made the while experience a horrible one. Never will I ever go back to taco bell that was so unprofessional and uncalled for. She needs to be demoted or take classes on customer service. I definitely will be contacting the corporate office about this experience and all the rude things she said. Forgot until tonight why I don't go to taco bell. Claudia is NOT manager material!!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gotten pizza here I've had to either wait 10 min or it was past the time it should be served by. At least when i waited i knew the pizza was hot out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Please update your drive thru speakers so the inbreds inside Can comprende my order. 3 crunchy tacos with sour Cream shouldn't be that hard.... And you charged me for sour Cream idiots"}
{"text":"Usually a quick fix for fish

Was sad the night we tried \"Thick Cut Cod\"

{"text":"Worst fucking Taco Bell ever!!! They tried to steal from me! The dudes name running the register was HUNTER OR STEFANO! Bitch doesn't know how the fucking count and tried to steal 10 dollars from me. My order was 10.68!!! I gave the fat ass 20.75 change so I didn't have to have that much change. He didn't give me shit back and put on the receipt I gave him 10.75!!! I'm beyond livid I had to get out my car and get my 10 bucks back by asking for the manager! I do not recommend this location they hire kids who don't know what the hell they are doing!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time as a kid, when it was new. It's gone very downhill and as mentioned, the wait time for 'fast' food is ridiculous. It's a miracle if you get the correct order... and another miracle if it isn't slopped together. I had to go in to the store, lugging in my toddler, to make my drive thru order correct, and was just stared at by the employees like it was no big deal. It took forever for one of them to acknowledge my existence and when they did they just said 'she has a bag...' and then what I'm assuming was the head of the operation that day just goes about her business then finally says it will be a second. She never came to talk to me, however. One of the young kids finally came to see what was up. Also... the burrito supreme we got had a dab of beans and a few nibbles of beef... and it was pathetically wrapped up. The taco was falling apart from the soggy meat seeping through the bottom of the shell. Such a disappointing location."}
{"text":"I hate this location. Only here does it take more than ten minutes to get the one item I ordered. The staff are friendly, but they move at a glacial pace. If this wasn't right by my house I would never come here. I still avoid it most of the time."}
{"text":"We have been here times. In the last 2 months. The drive thru staff don't speak at all and throw your food at you. And in those 3 visits  they have gotten them all wrong. One night they put sote cream on our bean burrito. Call and the genral manger told us he would refund us. My wife has gone to get it and they give her the rin around. They need to train there staff better and stop lieing to there customers. I will never go nack and advise my friends and family to not to go there. Beware of there drive thru."}
{"text":"They need to hire people that actually knows how to speak English and take them fucking orders right. Also hire people that actually has experienced in the kitchen. When I was ordering my food I lean over to see who was making my food. That guy likes like he was on crystal meth like wtf!"}
{"text":"This is for Darius! We stopped in this afternoon and my order had beef not black beans. He saw me walking up to the counter and knew right away something wasn't right, he was SO NICE! He fixed my order quickly and was so polite about it. Thank you for the great customer service"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the alcohol infused freezes plus a mid daddy snack. The food is your standard Taco Bell fare.

The real MVP here is the booze which is added in to your lovely Baja blast freeze or any of the other freezes you may desire. You have the option of adding vodka, tequila, or whiskey in your drink. Many of my friends often for whisky but we're not as satisfied with the taste of their freeze. 

Be sure to opt for the vodka in my opinion, because it blends in nicely with whatever freeze you may desire. 

A double shot is also an upgrade option."}
{"text":"I literally been in the drive thru for 30 minutes this is ridiculous your food isn't fresh I don't understand the point will never return to these tards"}
{"text":"Note to self:  the chicken in the chicken taco looks suspect.  Against my better judgment I tried a couple of bites of my chicken taco.  The chicken was so white it scared me, lol.  It wasn't awful but it was terribly bland and almost appeared undercooked. 

On the bright side, this place is clean, service is quick, and the doritos locos taco is pretty good."}
{"text":"All I asked is for her to throw away the cup when I emptied the coffee into my own cup. She got bent outta shape but then said I'll do it this ONE time... I drove away, I'll recycle it at home... won't be back to that Taco Bell"}
{"text":"This is by far the most uncleaned Taco Bell ever!! Food on tables, chairs, floor, uncleaned soda counter, bugs crawling near the drink machines. I asked one of the girls in the back if she could bus a table and she looked at me and said \"oh no, I am line chef\". Instead of offering to ask another employee to help with the messiness in their restaurant. (They were not busy at 5:45-6:30) I ordered food for \"Dine In\" the Hispanic shift leader could not read the English printed on my receipt. She said \"Oh sorry\" but didn't do anything about it. The employee who took my food out of the bag, tried to give me a dirty tray, I had to ask for a clean one? I also asked if they wiped down the trays before they stacked them, because they missed mine and the customer behind me's trays. The bucket of water with cleaner for the tables has not been changed in maybe 2 weeks? It's dirty and brown almost foamy on top? While in the restaurant the employees in the kitchen were \"goofing off\", \"Running from one side of the food station to the other\" and several food handling rules were broken. Also the smell of ripe sewage was disgusting. They may be on septic but there is a good way to handle it, not waiting so long to pump is one. The employees are parking in front of the restaurant, which is a big no."}
{"text":"This is a very slow Taco Bell. It took forever for someone to come to the counter then another 10-15 min for our order?! My burritos were small and skimpy"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there is a review.  Is there anyone who doesn't already know what Taco Bell offers?  Still...  For a cheap meal almost any time of day, it's hard to go wrong.  My favorite is a steak burrito supreme (add chipolte sauce)."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Taco bell for many years and have always loved the food. However, this evening my opinion has changed. I ordered two of my favorite items, the Taco Salad and Burrito Supreme. I was shocked how they both have apparently changed for the worse. The taco salad is so much smaller and is even in a smaller box. The taco salad is so small now, I can hold the whole salad in the palm of my hand and I couldn't do that before. I noticed even the tray the salad rests on is now very similar or the same one used for the taco pizza tray. I am not happy that taco bell has shrunk the salad. Also, the burrito supreme is much smaller and now i can easily finish both they are so small. I ordered the beef versions of both and if this is what is happening at taco bell then I will go somewhere else. Not happy. I can say as I was ordering I noticed the service was very good and fast. I ordered take out and ate at home. This particular Taco bell is very clean and nice looking. Because of the  change is portion size I have to give a two star rating.
If taco bell changes sizes of portions they need to tell us because we expected different."}
{"text":"I've been here twice over the past year, and each time the restaurant is clean and the staff is prompt and friendly. Taco Bell well is Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is terrible!! I gave them a pass the last time I was there because it was busy and whatever. But I ordered a cheesy gordita crunch, along with some other things, only to realize once I got home that they FORGOT my cheesy gordita crunch!! They had my soft tacos but forgot my main entree?! Who does that??? The next time I went there they tell me they have neither beef nor steak?! The only reason I came here was for a steak double-fills, seriously considering never coming here again despite the fact it is almost literally across the street from my house. They never have what I want, and almost never give me what I actually order. Seriously, either change your management or learn how order/prep properly, it's not that difficult"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Taco Bell I have ever been to. It is wonderfully managed and the owner is so friendly and will remember your face and your favorite hot sauce."}
{"text":"Hell no my company is all writing corporate today about this locale. False ads items come in smaller container many in different container you'll get fries in xsmall envelopes!!"}
{"text":"Place is trash 9/10 times I come here the freeze machine is down at all times of the day. 2 hot sauce packs for 3 burritos, an when I got my food it look like a 4 year old pulled it out of an easy bake oven!"}
{"text":"I decided to write this review after going to numerous Taco Bell's and finding nothing but irritation except for this location.  

I ordered crispy taco's and they were hot and fresh. The correct amount of beef to lettuce/cheese ratio.  (Not the typical vegetarian taco that you didn't ask for that is nothing but lettuce and a few shreds of cheese.) 

The drive thru attendant was very friendly and had a fantastic attitude.  Supplied me with sufficient napkins, asked what kind and how many hot sauce I'd like and gave me a receipt. (When you don't get a receipt, then you know they feel they were not up to par.  They don't want you to call and report how crappy they are.)  LOL!"}
{"text":"A picture is worth a thousand words. Enough said. Well, I thought I said enough, but apparently not for Yelp. They required more verbiage so I will say that this tostada was pathetic!! Great if you are on a diet! Did they start giving employees profit sharing checks so they are cutting corners (or should I say leaving them bare) for more profit??"}
{"text":"I only go to this location because it's closer to me. However, this restaurant is always filthy and the service is incredibly slow. I even tried going through the drive thru and it took over 20 minutes with 3 or 4 cars in front of me."}
{"text":"This location SUCKS E.V.E.R.Y. TIME!!! They are very consistent for sure!! Service is SUPER S.L.O.W. EVERY TIME!! I asked for no lettuce on my kid's tacos and they didn't put lettuce on mine either! I stood in line behind a $40 order while my food was getting cold to ask for some lettuce. The guy disappears and in a bit returns with a tiny little one ounce condiment cup with a few sheds of lettuce and it contained the core of the lettuce which was inedible!! 

I went back up to the counter to ask for a bag to take my tacos home so I could add lettuce at home and the dude was back with the cooks just chatting away!! Either he didn't see me for a few minutes or he saw me and didn't give a damn that I was waiting. Either way was unacceptable!! 

The owner of this store needs to monitor this location because his employees are not doing an adequate job!! We usually drive a few miles out of our way to a different location, but occasionally we give this place a try thinking it can't suck forever. DONE giving them any more chances!!"}
{"text":"Great location. They make the food fast and the way it's supposed to be made. Good customer service! It's quick and efficient (what more do you need in a fast food?)"}
{"text":"Tonight I was waiting my turn in the drive thru line and the lady in front of me was so loud that I could hear her over my radio being rude and condescending to the young man working the drive thru. He was very polite to her and didn't seem to let her attitude bother him. I go here about 3x a week and although, they can be inconsistent with the food preparation, I admire the positive attitude displayed by the staff."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. Let's be honest about what this is. Mexican inspired fast food you get as a teenager or a drunk young adult. 

I got two boxes of tacos for the teenagers at my house. Got home and the box that was supposed to be supreme tacos wasn't. I drove back because the $4.80 I spent for tomatoes and sour cream was worth the five minute drive. 

The four star rating is definitely not for the food. That is a three star review any day at this chain (maybe). The four comes from the treatment the shift manager gave me. It would have been easy to be annoyed. Instead she was apologetic, told me to keep the tacos I brought back and rapidly made my replacement order. This is not the kind of service one would expect at any fast food chain. 

That shift manager has customer service and interaction mastered."}
{"text":"Nice clean new Taco Bell.  Service has been very good on multiple visits.  Everyone nice and courteous.  Food good as well.  It's a good stop."}
{"text":"I usually go to this location and no problems. I love the dollar menu because duh it's a dollar buuut when I went to get the fries nachos.. a few tomato's were green and I ate some already so idk if I ate the ones were greens . Super disgusting never going to this location ever again.. smh"}
{"text":"I'm a Taco Bell addict.  If I'm on the road and hungry, I'll run for the border.  Needless to say, there are some awful Taco Bells out there.  This is a really nice one. (The one on Indian Bend is good too, but this one is usually less busy.)  Today, Ashley S. gave me service that was review worthy.  She anticipated my needs with my 4 year old and 2 year old, and then made the suggestion to make several of my a la carte items into a combo to save a little bit of money.  Awesome!  That's the kind of service that creates loyalty.  My prior experience here required manager attention, and Ashley -- today's cashier -- just made up for all prior issues.  Food was great (if you like Taco Bell), the brewed iced tea was fresh (my main complaint about the FLW/Shea location), the bathroom was clean (I'm talking two kids with dad in the bathroom \"don't-touch-anything-mode\" memorably clean), and the restaurant was spotless (if you have been to Taco Bell before elsewhere, you probably think I'm lying, I'm not!)."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way to Asheville hoping to grab a quick bite for the road.  Placed my order at 1:12pm and was stuck in the drive thru until 1:38pm.  If not for the cement blocking my escape, I would have left earlier! 

No apology.  No \"Sorry for the wait\". Nothin'!"}
{"text":"Great food & customer service last night! It was around 2:30 & they were alive & smiling! Enjoy coming here out of all the Taco Bell's!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy. Opens till late. nuf said. try all the stuff on the menu. esp. the mexican pizza. you will be amazed."}
{"text":"The neighborhood is a little scary at night. We had someone came up to our car asking for the taco in our hands late at night. so lock your doors! Otherwise, friendly staff. They know that if you are ordering spicy food, they will give you fire or hot sauce. Very smart!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell-- What can one say about it? The service is kind of slow here. I have been in faster drive thrus. Ha!"}
{"text":"So it comes to this! I am writing a review on a fast food joint. Why would I do that? Imma tell you! DORITO SHELLS!!!!! That's why!

Once up on a time, I was a pretty big fan of the Bell. Pretty good grub for a pittance. But as the years went by the beef filling got thinner and thinner and the lettuce started taking up it's place. I was there for a beef taco, not a lettuce taco with beef flavoring.  

But NOW they've gone and done it. Take the traditional shell and turn it into a Dorito chip. STFU!!!!!!! I would like to kiss, square on the lips, whoever came up with this idea (yep, even a guy, don't mind smooching a man for an idea this good!).  Seriously, I would cover the medical bills if this person broke their arm patting themselves on the back.

As a bonus for this visit, there was a fellow named George who was doing pretty much the entire front side of the business. At one time he was ringing my order up on one register while finishing payment for another customer on another! It was like watching a yo-yo-er yo-yo-ing with both hands. Kudos' to George, you deserve a raise.

\"Why then, Vic, are you only giving 4 out of 5 star's, when you obviously enjoyed your visit\", you may ask.(and you may)

Three words: Not Enough Beef!"}
{"text":"To say that this was the slowest fast food I have ever encountered would not be an understatement... I stopped off here for a quick bite because we needed to head out of town and usually when we go here; it's fast and delicious with a friendly staff... This visit was neither... lol

I got there on the end of some customer service dispute... Apparently, this means instead of the customary easy going vibe I'm used to, I walked right into the snarkiest place of the day... The patron and employee were still attempting to \"kill each other with kindness,\" but not genuine kindness... The kind that says, keep talking and I'm coming across that counter with a broken taco shell at your carotid... I think the cashier was a little disoriented by what had gone down before I got there because I repeated my order at least three times and she still got it wrong... I ordered a Nachos Bell Grande with no sour cream, a Beefy Nacho griller and the Doritos box... The Doritos box was for the boyfriend and his food was fine... I got a Nachos Supreme and the griller thing... The griller had to have been made quite some time ago because none of the corn chips were still crispy, so I didn't even finish it... And the Nachos Supreme is a smaller version of the food I wanted... I was hungry as hell, but all out of food... And there is something really wrong with their drink machine in the dining room... I got a Pepsi and a fruit punch... That fruit punch tasted like someone drained it through a real life sweaty sweatsock...  I couldn't even drink half of it...

Anyway, I gave them three stars because I couldn't go two and a half... But I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say this was just a one time thing... I don't know what was going on in there the other day, but I hope it's over in case I go back..."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong the first time. Seemed like a simple mistake. Contacted, they told me no big deal just bring my receipt next time I come in and my meal would be free. 

When I came back in a few days later, I had the cook argue with me and tell me that she made it right. They still made it, but I usually avoid complaining about an order anywhere I go no matter how bad it was. Unfortunately I didn't eat them last time so I called this time. Not particularly happy about the confrontation."}
{"text":"Hello to all, 
Yesterday my friend and I went to this specific Taco Bell after a very tiring evening at the mall and were absolutely exhausted and nearly starving. We went inside and there was six people in there, who may I add already ordered. We then ordered our food, which consisted of two freezes, a bean burrito, a quesadilla, and a nacho fry. The only good thing was that we got our freezes right away, but the blue raspberry freeze machine was down! The blue raspberry freezes are my favorite too! Anyways, we then sat down waiting for our order, which we ordered to go. It was 9 o'clock when we arrived and ordered around 9:05 p.m. We did not receive our very small order, now consisting of just the three small food items until around 9:30 p.m! That is a very long wait and is not acceptable! 
This Taco Bell should not be considered fast food, but slow food! As someone who is deeply devoted to the Taco Bell industry, I was highly disappointed by the outcome of this visit. As a teenage girl, I have curfew and considering I was 25 minutes away from home and still had to take my friend home, my parents were not happy about my 10:30 p.m arrival. Taco Bell in Strongsville, get your act together please."}
{"text":"Literally just bought two burritos there and all I got was potato in a tortilla, really? No beef no cheese, to the person making it, did that look like something you would eat when you were rolling it up? That's what I get for going to Taco Bell drive through when I was in a hurry. I can't believe we have to pay 10 soon to be 10.50 an hour for minimum wage employees who can't even work fast food correctly."}
{"text":"This store stole money from me! Said they were open on Xmas Eve and took my online pick-up order but weren't open!!! What the f"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell. Fast food, Americanized Mexican food. It's cheap and quick. We seem to stop here after a late night at the bar and suddenly realize we're hungry and have nothing in the frig. Taco's, Mexican Pizza, Nachos, or chicken Chalupas are usually what I get; my husband seems to like their burritos. Don't expect anything hot or spicy even with the sauce packets."}
{"text":"The employees here are all very nice and the food as a whole is what I would expect from a Taco Bell. 

But the burrito I had here about two months ago had such a strong patchouli taste that I have not gone back. It seriously tasted as if it had been seasoned with patchouli."}
{"text":"Taco Bell had not failed us here at this location. The employees are on the line busting their tail for us. Customer service here is one of the best ones in town. Food is really good, this TACO BELL folks, gotta love it."}
{"text":"Uh ok? I'm sorry but if you're supposed to be open, you have to be open? You can't close at 10:30 when you're open until 1. I didn't drive this far only to be told you're closing early. I don't really care if you're short staffed. So... that's cool"}
{"text":"Just like any fast food in a trashy \"gettho\" area the service here is off and the food is what to be found at a Taco Bell. The dining room is a bit dirty and you can tell the people who work here don't want to be here."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell in the world and I've been to many.  The kids working here have no drive and no people skills! Slow and shitty service, with no remorse.  Good job Mentor Public Schools on teaching these kids for the future, our world looks promising..."}
{"text":"Should be renamed as a Slow food restaurant.  This place has the slowest workers of all time!  I could see if the food was free, were still paying customers.  How about hiring people who can walk and chew gum at the same time, a bunch of Bozos!

It's not like it's real Mexican food,  I waited 10 minutes to order and the another 18 till I received my order we spent $23 we should went to a real restaurant.

Run to the boarder, run to Del Taco across the street, run any where , just make sure you run away from this Taco Bell!


Next day I had to run to the toilet!  Stay Clear of this place!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Stopped in for a wee bite after hiking. Yummy 5 layer vegan burrito."}
{"text":"I've been in here half a dozen times, and by far my favorite Taco Bell to date. They are always serving fresh food when I come in here, so they either do it regularly, or I'm just special, but realistically they do it for everyone. I could say more, but I think their food says it best."}
{"text":"Drive thru was pretty cool, real quick and the dude at the window hooked it up with Extras. Nice staff, I come here often to pick up cravings for my pregnant wife, I'm just happy it's cool people I deal with when I drive by."}
{"text":"Going through a drive-thru has a level of speed that is expected.  It's not just this Taco Bell location that is struggling to get orders out, but I was here so they get the review.  

I was behind one car that was giving an order.  I don't know if it was the car's driver or the drive thru that was having the delay but it was eating into my time.  Once that car moved up, I gave my order quickly but then again I sat behind this car waiting for an extended period of time for their food to be handed to them.  

The reason for the three stars, was the young man at the window.  He was pleasant and smiling.  Food was a bit quicker to come out to me than the car ahead of me.  Taste and quality was what I had expected from my order."}
{"text":"I've been in Henderson for approximately four months and have had some sketchy experiences at fast food joints. Fortunately, this Taco Bell has always been good to me and my better half.

There's a girl by the name of Britney that works the drive-through window and four out of five times when we've rolled through the drive-through, she has taken care of us. Last night at approximately 11:45 PM she greeted us and was very sweet and kind, always smiling and happy.

The food has always been great and the service is over-the-top cool. Thank you Britney for making our fast food dining experience so pleasurable!"}
{"text":"I hate having to give this place 1 star.  Never once have they got the order correct.  Been charged duplicate times on my credit card several times and had to dispute the charge with my credit card company.  Food quality sucks, and they are often out of items.  On last visit our sierra mist drinks were all soda water, tried to call the number on the receipt to let them know to change it out, and it is a NON WORKING NUMBER.  This has been going on for over 10 years.  I have no idea how corporate has not come in and closed this place down, or done anything about it... I now drive down the road to Happy Valley for Taco Bell and get the expected service and order is always right.  It's a shame because I drive right by this location to get to that one.  I try this place again about once a year figuring the probably finally were forced to clean up their act, and nope same thing.  Crazy."}
{"text":"Went here for dine in today. The cashier had punched out and I could tell she was in a hurry to leave. She saw us come in, but everyone else was busy, so she stayed and helped us anyways. That's my idea of good service! I think this place has come quite a way since they first opened, and I'm pleased with the improvements."}
{"text":"Not much to say here except that it's in a bad location and there's always some sort of dramatic commotion going on With the homeless people. Not that there is anything wrong with homeless people it just always seems to be some sort of fight going on. Food is meh I really wasn't raised liking Taco Bell I prefer authentic Mexican food. But because of my fellow white co workers they love this place so I tag along lol."}
{"text":"Such a great Taco Bell. The pizza but side however is terrible. They never have pizza or breadsticks ready. Gave me free cinnamon twist for waiting once for my pizza though so I'm not complaining"}
{"text":"Just watched a manager yell when his employee tried to buy food after the shift. He yelled do you have another card that one declined. Completely unacceptable move by anyone to announce that loudly especially to an employee. Shouldn't they get Atleast one free taco?! So sad"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is unfortunately our weakness around here. My husband and I get it often late at night after work and we've been to many different locations. I am that annoying customer that wants everything modified and almost every single time Taco Bell gets something wrong.....well, not at this location! They get it 100% right every single time!!! They actually know what they're doing. The reason they don't get 4 stars? Because no matter how incredible they are or how much I crave their food at times, it's still crap food! Ha."}
{"text":"The food tasted different, the Pepsi tasted like it had dirt in it and without carbonation, the tables were all dirty. I ordered a double chicken protein bowl and it had what looked like have a spoon size amount of chicken. Not impressed, my husband and I will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"When in Parma, you gotta stop here. Best Taco Bell for miles!  Taco, burritos, nachos!  This place had it all. Actually, it's pretty clean and good for a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"You can definitely tell management has been  making efforts to improve this franchise. The staff are mostly friendly and prompt. The tacos are filled to the edge with ingredients, and the line moves pretty quickly now. Sometimes they leave an item out of my order or give me unsweet tea instead of sweet, which is the worst, but most of the time everything is great."}
{"text":"The worst Taco Bell ever. That's saying something. Half the menu was unavailable, but they took my order and charged my card anyway. Then left half the order out of the bag. Took 30 minutes after that to get the remaining items."}
{"text":"This was the worse experience I've had at a place like this. I walked in and was told it would be a min to order. The lady went to the drive thur window taking orders. I waited 20 mins the line to order in the lobby grew, still nothing from anyone. Finally I and half the line left. This was crazy and ignored the whole time. This was Monday 10/16"}
{"text":"The girl that helped me today in the drive thru must be new. Worst experience I've had at this T Bell. Took way too long to order (she didn't know what I was ordering). Took about 10-15 minutes to get the food, then since I was now pressed for time, when I open my bag once I got to work, it is the entirely wrong order. I ordered and paid for a bacon am crunch wrap and bacon eg and cheese biscuit taco with a coffee and got 2 sausage am crunch wraps. Not even close!!  It's a shame because they used to be a good T Bell...."}
{"text":"Got a Mexican pizza asked for no sauce because i cant handle anything with spice (my mouth swells its not fun) with extra cheese so what do they do they put nasty spicy queso cheese under the shredded cheese, so i can't tell and take two big bites out of it and now have a swollen mouth and appetite ruined! way to ruin lunch and make my mouth burn! Who does that!"}
{"text":"I screwed up my order after a rough day 
Frank was very polite when fixing my mistake
Food was very good and the place was clean 
Kids were very happy with their quesadillas and Dorito loco tacos 
This place has a lot of very nice people that work here and is always nice to come into"}
{"text":"Been here many times and they have always gotten my order right. They are slow compared to other taco bells but food is decent."}
{"text":"Clean inside. Quick drive thru. Always get my order right. What more can you ask for from a tbell?"}
{"text":"I gotta give this location credit. They handle the lunch rush like champs! I've been through the drive thru and inside during the week and either way, they always have my order down. I'd come to expect forgotten items, wrong orders, etc. from fast food drive thrus while they're busy, but not this one! Always delivers. As for the food? Cmon. You're here for a cheap taco burrito hybrid item. It's sufficient."}
{"text":"Does there exist a more friendly and energetic Taco Bell? I think not. I dare you to find one. This place has to top the rest. I travel the country for work and have eaten at many taco bells. This location would rival in-n-out burger. Wether you go through the drive through or eat inside you're bound to leave a little happier. And the food quality is great too. Good work ladies! Keep it up. And note to Managment: do whatever you can to keep them on the payroll."}
{"text":"The first time we went here was okay, just a regular taco bell. But, a few weeks ago my husband went and picked up food and ordered my food with no onions or red sauce. Once home, I found out all of it had onions and red sauce even though the receipt was correct. And then tonight, my husband went a grabbed food again, got all the way home and we realized that my tacos were missing. Messing up my dinner once sucks, messing it up the past two times we've gotten food there and I am done."}
{"text":"I have been here 20 or so times in the last few years, and I'm upset every time we leave there. The drive thru lines are insane, and I'd say it takes 15 or so minutes from the time you pull up until the time you pull away. There is almost always something wrong with my order, or the food is half what it should be. If you order supreme anything, you have got to check it before you pull away. They always forget that you paid extra to add sour cream and tomatoes, and usually leave it off. 

It's so discouraging that these kids make $10 an hour and have absolutely no care or regard for their job or customer service. I wish someone else would buy this franchise location and make it better."}
{"text":"The ladies working the drive through did not know what was going on. The woman who took our orders tried to combine order and then double charge the second order. She then charged for \"extra\"  items that were included in our meals, like sour cream in a potato griller. I think they were over charging more  for late night drivers  and ripping off late night customers."}
{"text":"Not only is it outdated but they got my order wrong AND the only other person in the buildings order wrong. Can't even blame it on being busy they just didn't pay attention. The second star is because they were nice about fixing the order and didn't charge us to fix it. (We ordered a five layer but didn't get charged for it or receive it.) one of the younger guys working had a bad attitude and slammed things around as he cleaned. The only good thing about this place was the manager was kind enough to fix our order."}
{"text":"My fellow Mexican brothers and sisters are going to lynch me, decapitate me and hang my head on a corner of a grain storage building in Guanajuato (look it up), but I actually really like Taco Bell. I remember a long time ago, when Taco Bell \"threatened\" to open stores in Mexico all the Mexican-American were up in arms about it. But most of us Mexicans were like, \"hell yeah!\" best munchies ever!

Anyway, this Taco Bell is very clean and the staff is uncharacteristically friendly. I really liked the way the cashier treated me when placing my order and offering items that complemented my order. At the end, he offered me his name and to let him know if I needed anything... Thiking back now, he might have been hitting on me. Less than 5 minutes later, another guy called my order number and not only did he wait there until I picked up my order, he thanked me for visiting and told me to come back to visit them soon. He did this to the other three customers behind me as well. That is the type of service you don't get in fast food anymore. That's why this Taco Bell gets 3 stars instead of the default 2 I give to fast food places just for opening their doors.

 No point in discussing the food, it's mass processed and it tastes the same no matter which taco bell you go to."}
{"text":"Hahahahhahhahah.  
What a joke. First we ask the counter girl what's in this new thing they had and she didn't know so she asked a fellow employee/cook and he didn't know either. Anyway we ordered and had to wait @ 15 minuets for my change. I handed here a $20 bill and they act like it was a $100 bill. Also I recommend not to use the rest rooms. Filthy filthy filthy. Looked one a jailhouse bathroom.  When I spoke with the manager I asked her if she gave a sh** and I don't believe so."}
{"text":"Although the service was friendly and fast, I got a lot more than  expected with my order when I woke up with a raging  case of food poisoning within hours of eating. I know the old adage, you get what you pay for but I'm honestly surprised it's possible to even get food poisoning from taco bell since 90% of their food is \"just add water\" fake crap. 

Either way, lesson learned. The cheapest of cheap isn't worth the bowel shattering explosions I'm currently enduring."}
{"text":"Jovanas customer service skills are the best! Always a blast when she's in the store. It's not often you get kind people at the drive thru."}
{"text":"I just want to say excellent customer service from Beebee what a sweet soul. Thank you"}
{"text":"Line went super fast. Did not mess up my order at all. Food was good and din't make me feel sick afterwards which is always a plus. Easy to find and right by a light so it is easy to get out of. The drive through window is a little small though but it is right next to my window in my car so I didn't have to reach at all to get my order. Will be coming back here a lot."}
{"text":"Fast service. Don't tell you how much your food is through the drive through until you go up to pay which is a little annoying but won't stop me from coming here again. Food is always good and they have yet to mess my order up yet which is always good."}
{"text":"Fast service and before you go up to the window to pay and get your food they ask if your order is correct on the screen which I like a lot that they do that. I am giving this place a 4 out of 5 stars only because they messed up a part of my order. Besides that I really like this Taco Bell out of a lot that I have been to."}
{"text":"I have nothing too bad to say about this Taco Bell really. I've never had any issues with getting the wrong items, the employees are always nice, repeat my order back to make sure it is right and always ask if I want any sauce. It can get very busy though since it is right next to the ASU campus so beware of that."}
{"text":"Super fast through the drive though. Although one employee who was taking my order through the drive though did yell at me cause I said something wrong which I thought was bad customer service but besides that i'll be coming back here again, and they didn't mess my order up at all which I loved."}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell here could be - literally these guys speak no English in its correct form"}
{"text":"24 hours always a hit and super polite customer service!  Fast food. Tacos. Tasty. Cheap."}
{"text":"I eat here often and what can I say....it's Taco Bell. But I can say that every time I've been here the service has been great and the restaurant is clean!  To me that separates this place from other Taco Bells."}
{"text":"I was told at the drive thru they were closed. My iphone indicated it was 1:57am. The posted hours indicated they closed at 2am. Just lazy employees."}
{"text":"No answer to our phone calls! We waited over 5 min at drive thru.....they guy comes to the window and uses an excuse that someone else's order got messed up so that was the reason for the wait.  Then we get home and a part of our order is missing!!! So we call and no answer! Horrible service and horrible inconvenience! BTW.....cool ranch tacos no taste and shell was all cracked! Not worth the $1.69! Pathetic!"}
{"text":"Just spend ten bucks on 4 Doritos tacos with no lettuce for my daughter and her friend.
Basically got the taco shell and a few crumbs of meat. 
What a rip off!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Taco Bell, and things have gotten smaller since then. Tonight we got a couple of Crunchwrap Supremes and Chicken Quesadillas. The items have noticeably shrunk, on top of being poorly made at this location. But the food was still delicious as always and the service was fast."}
{"text":"I grew up on Taco Bell, I absolutely love Taco Bell. That said, I have never reviewed a Taco Bell on yelp before. But this Taco Bell is just exceptional and warrants a five star review. Not only does this Taco Bell deliver the best tacos and burritos I've ever had at a Taco Bell, it is also beautifully decorated inside, always perfectly clean, and most important of all - the people that work at this Taco Bell are just so, so nice. Customer service at this location is excellent - whether I walk in, or go through the drive-through, the people working take the time to ask me how my day is, they always have a smile on their face and are pleasant - I really appreciate this :-) so I just wanted to say, keep up the great work - thank you for all of the delicious meals, I always look forward to going to this Taco Bell, and will drive out of my way to get there even when there are other Taco Bell's closer."}
{"text":"Slooooooooowwwwww service and they didn't put hardly any filling in any of the items we ordered. We will avoid this particular Taco Bell. Not sure if they are extra slow because they are combined with a Long John Silvers. Still no excuse to wait 15 minutes for our \"fast\" food order."}
{"text":"Clean.  Updated.  Also has a KFC inside.  Better than other locations.  I was use to the A&W + KFC locations but this one is very tempting to frequent often due to this combo."}
{"text":"I would give them a better rating if they could just get my order right! It's always a 50% chance that they won't get it right. I specialize every thing I order so I expect this every once in a while, but it truly is every other time. 
I hit the drive thru once a week for the last 3 yrs and almost always order the same things.
I always add extra cheese to my items and half the time it is not added. At $.30 per item- it irritates me. Lately I just order a side of shredded cheese so I can just take a quick look and know it's in the bag, but they charge $.50 for it on-the-side. 

They also can't seem to decide if they will or won't charge for guacamole instead of sour cream. I always order no sour cream. If I add extra guacamole, some cashiers hit the sub button, some charge for it. I never say anything, but I think it is funny that some employees do it and others don't.

On the positive- I have tried to pay at the window 4 times and been told the car before me paid for my order- so then I pay for the car behind me. Sometimes that \"pay it forward\" just makes my day!!

Anytime I have to wait long in the drive thru, they take 10% off my total.
I always ask specifically for a spork and the drive thru people will walk out to they lobby to get one if they don't have it at the window.
The employees are SUPER NICE!! Always friendly. But- I am super nice back. I worked in fast food back in the day and being courteous is greatly appreciated. :)"}
{"text":"I know its a chain, I also know its not authenic Mexican food, but every now and again I get a Taco Bell craving I just have to satisfy!
Plus if you make some wise menu choices, you can eat good without ingesting a whole lot of fat grams. For example, I get 2 steak soft tacos fresco style which is pico de gallo instead of cheese and sour cream. The pico is very good and you can taste the fresh cilantro. This drops the fats grams to only 4 each. Add a side of rice (only 3 fat grams)  cover in fire sauce and add an unsweet tea or diet coke and you eatin' good for only 11 grams of fat! Pretty good from a fast food joint, huh? I also get a side of guacamole that really good, but I don't count it as it has it has all the good kinds of fats that are good for you! A win win situation.
I aslo thinks its pretty damn tasty! Thats right, I said it, I LIKE TACO BELL!!
Plus most locations I have been in are clean and the counter service is friendly.
I don't eat here once a week or even once a month, but when the craving does hit, I'm  thinking outside the box and making a run for the border!"}
{"text":"Oh my God the woman 18 year old whatever working the drive-through with the 4\" long nails oh my God you need to get a new job there are snails that work faster than you"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the nicest staff at any fast food place I have ever seen.  They are soooo nice and cheery.  Seriously, I want to call corporate and tell them to give these people raises or something.  My order is always right, extra sauce is always in bag, and when I order whoever is on the other end is super chipper.  Not fake, genuinely happy.  It's just refreshing.  Nachos bell grande, extra cheese, no tomato pls.  thank you."}
{"text":"I'm from Minnesota and was staying in Estrella while my husband was working here. I stopped in while on a walk one day and couldn't get over how friendly and helpful the staff was! Food was great too! The second time I came a young man named Jacob served me, he has got to be the nicest young man I've ever met! Everyone in the place was commenting how great he was! If only there were more Jacobs in this world!! Great Job with your staffing Taco Bell! Jacob deserves a huge raise!!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST ran Taco Bell I have ever been to. Consistently you will see the workers out smoking that should be handling the drive thru and they will just make you sit. Well today takes the cake - I pulled in behind a line of cars to sit for over 25 minutes and never move. All while I watched the \"manager\" walk out to talk to some girls and he even looked over and saw the line. I finally went in to see if I would have better luck only to hear the manager and employees yelling at each other. One employee was saying he gave his two weeks and the other was talking about locking the doors so they don't help anyone. Then the manager was yelling at them for something. Absolutely awful. After 30 minutes wasted and no order taken I left. 

To the owner- run your numbers. You are losing business because it is so poorly ran. This is a reflection of you and your lack of leadership!"}
{"text":"Got screwed tonight in the drive through. We ordered chips and cheese and when we got home the cheese wasn't even half full, only covered the sides of the cup. We called to talk to someone about it to let them know and the guy Richard there didn't seem to care at all and proceeded to interupt us talking to tell us to hold on... Very rude service. He's the only one there that has ever been rude to us."}
{"text":"Once again my order was wrong. You know this is my own fault. I should have known better. Wont happen again."}
{"text":"5 STARS for the super-friendly-very-enthusiastic girls that work this Taco Bell's drive-thru! They must be cheerleaders?! OMG! This is not normal! Food is also good at this Taco Bell!"}

{"text":"Workers and service is very good but they always have a problem with their computer drive thru was closed at 6:30 pm because computer was down again . But workers our great fix your computer. I left went else where"}
{"text":"I suspect that the person who took my order, which was vegan, intentionally gave me a beef and cheese burrito instead. Her name was Arbiata. Or something similar. The manager was also unapologetic and  uninterested. She rudely said she couldn't even refund me unless I drove all the way back. Totally disgusted."}
{"text":"Best Taco Bell I have ever been to. Hands down. Overall great experience!!! The best crunch wrap supreme...."}
{"text":"I ordered 7 items and only received 5. FAIL! Now one of my kids has to go hungry tonight. Thanks Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I know it's kind of funny to write a review on a Taco Bell because fast food is generally the same, but this location in particular stood out to me enough for me to still want to write a review a few days after my experience. 

I was in a rush and starting to feel hangry so I pulled into the quickest place I knew I could get something really fast from. Right away I was pleasantly surprised by the girl in the drive thrus demeanor. Very bubbly and patient. Didn't rush me through my order and even asked how my day was going. Nice. 

The rest of the drive thru staff was friendly as well. It was the first time I ever felt like I was getting the best service possible, at a fast food restaurant. Seriously. And I liked that my food came out looking nice as well. Normally my tacos and mexican pizzas are put together sloppy, but this place made my pizza look like something I'd buy at a sit down restaurant , making it so much easier to eat in my car!  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the service.  I have always received great service from this location and have nothing to complain about. However, Taco Bell's quality of food is another story. If you have the extra couple bucks, get a real taco or burrito from Chipotle or Los Taquitos nearby. However, if you like cheap and tasteless food then this place is perfect for you. I only gave them a better rating because they have fast and quick service. The food quality is out of their control but I wouldn't give a business five stars solely on service."}
{"text":"You should probably teach Monica how to treat customers. She gave me 2 hot sauce. Asked for more she gave me 1 more i asked her if I can get a little more. She grins grabs a handful of probably 20 of them and tries to give them to me."}
{"text":"you do not even deserve 1 star.... very very disappointed taco shells were stale I asked for extra cheese didn't happen but I was charged for it...nachos were awful cold on stale chips this happens a lot...I am so done with coming here again.....is there an actual manager here besides some one who does not speak inglish???? very unhappy......"}
{"text":"Probably the slowest Taco Bell I've ever been to, and I am the Taco Bell queen. My friend ordered a taco to go over fifteen minutes ago and we're still here waiting. Also it's very weird that the bathrooms don't have mirrors. Lady at the front desk was friendly."}
{"text":"After waiting in line in the drive through for over 20 minutes, I was told that they had ran out of chicken, beef, beans, and rice. This was the night of the 4th of July so you would think they would have expected to be busy. After waiting for so long, I thought they should have at least had someone come out and tell the cars waiting in the drive through, that they had run out of everything besides steak and desserts so that everyone did not waste their time waiting in a very long and slow line. I'm very disappointed by this taco bell."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst taco bell experience I have ever had. First, there were maybe 4 cars ahead of us in the drive thru line and it took us over 20 minutes just to reach the intercom. Then, when it was our turn we were told \"I'll be with you in a minute\" instead of a typical hospitable response like \"Sorry for the wait, I'll be right with you\". We left the line and went to another location that took 4 minutes to take our order& serve it to us through the drive thru. My husband is a veteran& a very loyal taco bell patron and we have never had an experience like this before. I have been in the restaurant business for 10 years and the treatment we received from the 9251 w union hills location was unacceptable. If I were in corporate shoes I would look into the operating procedures of this location because my husband informed me that he has had an extended wait time in the drive thru for this location before. In this neighborhood, many of the patrons are retired veterans and they deserve better customer service. I understand the expectations for a restaurant can become stressful, but it does not excuse employees expressing that stress on the patrons that have chosen taco bell over the hundreds of other choices."}
{"text":"Gotta tell you for fast food this Taco Bell is pretty good. The staff is really friendly and Cheryl is the best. We have had Cheryl serve us through the drive-thru before amd its really nice to see a happy smiling worker at the drive thru. We bought $40 worth of food for the family and Some had no onions,  some had extra cheese and sauce and it was all correct!  Well well well this is the first TB that knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"Lady that helped me was nice 
Food was like at any other tacobell
Fountain was clean, floor ehhh lets just leave it at 5 star since I didn't stare too hard lol
Seems well kept and where I sat table was wiped down and clean 
They can use a smile but God knows what they went thru today :$
So thanks!"}
{"text":"The night crew is always nice and friendly 
Wish all other Taco Bell are like this.
Ty the manager always smile and make you feel welcome.
Thank you for the good service :)"}
{"text":"The KFC side of this place has a limited menu of sorts.  You can't get a bucket of chicken, just the sandwiches, boneless wings, chicken fries, etc.  The Taco Bell side however has the full menu.  Last night I tried their new snack sized crunch wrap.  In the combo you get two of the little guys which I found much better than the regular size.  Not the quickest of places but the staff are good and I've never had an error with my order."}
{"text":"Coming to a US Taco Bell is always an interesting experience.

First-off, there's no fries in US TB's. I learned that years ago when a group I was with apparently offended an employee by asking for fries supreme. It was like we were attacking a sacred family recipe by wanting ground beef and cheese on fries instead of nachos.

Second, the combos come with a taco, not with a side like you would get in Canada. If you want nachos supreme you have to make a special request.

Third, it's so much cheaper here. This is pretty standard across all fast food in the States. $5 for a Gordita combo here. Over $6 in Canada.

For this restaurant in particular, the service was good and the food came up quite fast. They have a choice of three different Doritos tacos. Hopefully they bring that choice to Canada soon.

Good call by the person who left the tip to swap a Doritos taco into a gordita. Delicious."}
{"text":"The customer service I received here was absolutely great! Everyone who helped me with my order was extremely friendly and delightful"}
{"text":"I live here and frequent this TB with my kids and for a quick notable and then. I have always received excellent and fast customer service. Over my 10 years here, there have only been a few slip ups, but those are to be expected. In general, one of the best locations in the Cleveland/Akron area. And I know...I've been to a lot of them!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I confess. I like Taco Bell. Usually not a Yelp check-in worthy event though. Definitely not review worthy. Except tonight. 

The workers on this visit were simply awesome. How often can you say that about a fast food restaurant? I eat at this Taco Bell fairly often, usually just running in for the quick and cheap $2.99 meal deal (a best buy, hard to find on the menu board), motivated by a dining room that is really nice compared to most Taco Bells.

On this night I was accompanied by extended family. Two unexpected things happened. First, I was offered an unexpected discount. Nice! Second, we were given some free cinnamon twists, prompted I think by the cute kids we had in tow. Even nicer! 

A great family outing at Taco Bell! Who knew? I was only expecting quick and cheap, but received much more."}
{"text":"The dining room is open!!! After what seemed like months of remodeling, the dining room is now open for business again. 

Don't expect a radical change. It's the same size. Some new flooring. Some new furniture. Some extra wall sockets. But a significant improvement given how tired this Taco Bell location had become. The change in the exterior is also a noticeable upgrade. And I suspect the added square footage behind the counter is a boost for employee morale. Also improved restrooms.

Just think, this Taco Bell was narrowly saved, thanks to some legal wrangling, from being converted into a Fry's Grocery Gas Station! Phew!!! Now it's all new and shiny! Well, mostly new and shiny.

A well below average Taco Bell before the remodel, this location is now quite nice. Still, the Taco Bell at nearby Tatum & Bell remains nicer. Perhaps if they offered valet parking like the neighboring Fry's Marketplace..."}
{"text":"This place is always slow. We almost always leave while waiting in line to get our food."}
{"text":"Like others have said, the drive thru attendant at night is awesome.  She sounds very cheerful and is very nice.  If you're looking for a late night place to eat, I would definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Don't waist your money. You are going to throw all your food away cause their will be hair in your food. Guaranteed"}
{"text":"Waited in a long line to place my healthy order. Got on the interstate north, realized I had the completely wrong order. I called so they would have it ready for me... They did not. When I got back, I had to repeat my order and wait again for it to be made. Why they didn't fix the order and have it ready to hand to me, I have no idea."}
{"text":"I work at a food establishment so I know how an employee should speak to a customer over the phone. I just called this location to ask a quick question and a young lady answered the phone. I quickly asked if Taco Bell still handed out coupons for Salt River Tubing, which I remember them doing a few years ago but I hadn't been to the Salt River since then. She was extremely rude and said 'I have no idea what you're talking about.' She had an annoyed tone of voice like I was disrupting her day for a 30 second phone call. I said, 'Okay, they must not do it anymore, thank you anyway!' And she didn't respond then hung up! Unbelievable. At least tell me to have a good day too. Sorry you hate your job so much that you have to spread your misery to your customers. Wonderful employee, Taco Bell. I'll make sure to never bring my business to this location."}
{"text":"Went to get food here at around 2:00 PM today. Got in the drive-thru line. Two cars were ahead of me and I waited for about 15 minutes. I backed out, parked and went inside. There were about 10 people waiting for their food with three people standing in line to order. I asked some people how long they had been waiting and someone sitting at a table said they were waiting for 30+ minutes. I left, but not before warning people coming in how long the wait was. I've worked in the service industry before and I understand food can take a while, but this is also \"fast\" food and when the employees are not upfront with you about expected wait time when you walk in, that's how you lose customer trust and business."}
{"text":"The reviews of people having to wait a while for food at this Taco Bell has become my reality as well. Waited over 20 minutes for food. Food came out exactly as expected, but bring a book or a puzzle to occupy your time while you wait."}
{"text":"One of the only fast food places in around the area that doesn't constantly mess up your order. The ladies in the drive thru window are mostly always pleasant. Love that I'm the morning you can grab breakfast anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite in between commitments... sat in the drive thru for almost half an hour! I wanted to say screw it, but their drive thru is so tight that once you're in, you're in! Frustrated!"}
{"text":"My fav fast food for tacos!!  This location is pretty fast and accurate.. The traditional crunchy tacos & double decker tacos are the best!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I think they only got my order wrong once or twice. Sometimes they overcook the grillers. I have never tried any of the special gourmet bowls they make at this location though."}
{"text":"We're vegan so eating out is always a struggle but we are traveling so we decided to stop here to get some bean burritos. The cashier was very nice but it took forever for us to get our food and then the woman who gave it to us who I am almost positive was in some position of authority, rolled her eyes at when I informed her that one of our burritos was supposed to be with red sauce instead of sour cream. I work in food service so I get how annoying it is when you're busy to have to remake things but please don't roll your eyes at me and walk away without saying anything, it's just rude. Definitely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Zero stars. This time it only took us 20 minutes to get our food at the drive-thru instead of 30 minutes!!! If they don't speed things up, I see them going out of business. That's how Burger King on Monona Drive was before they closed."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is my fast food guilty pleasure.  I crave that shit, A LOT!  This is the closest Taco Bell to work, so I find myself here once or twice a month.  Typical Taco Bell.  I enjoy their crunchy tacos, regular nachos, beefy Fritos burrito, as well as some of their new (aka, same ingredients, just repackaged into something else) stuff like the Quesalupa.  

What sets this one apart from other Taco Bells though is the hookup of hot sauces!  I hate when you ask for A LOT of sauce, and they throw maybe 1 sauce per item and occasionally one or two more in the bag.  At this Taco Bell, when you ask for A LOT of sauce, they don't fuck around!  They grab a huge fucking handful of sauces and throw them in the bag.  I ordered 4 items the other day, and was provided with about 20 sauces!  Score!  I think I might slang them on the black market!  If you want the goods, give me a call at 1-623-HOT-SAUC!  Call now and you can get BOGO!  Hurry up, the lines are lighting up as we speak. We are down to 860 hot sauces left...get them while you can.  Operators are available now!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell....where you have about 5 core ingredients, that can be transformed into about 30 different menu items!  You know what though, I crave it more than you would think!  I'm a huge fan of their regular crunchy tacos, double decker tacos,  as well as their plain nachos.  Something about that molten lava cheese sauce and their salty and slightly sweet tortilla chips.  I always have to get an order, sometimes two, whenever I get food here.  Prices are pretty low (they have gone up quite a bit from years past though.  I still remember $.59 cent tacos...they are now like $1.29), and you can still get a decent and filling meal for between $5.00-$7.00.  Service at this location is always friendly and there is never a long wait in the drive thru.  It's the closest one to my house and one of the more consistent Taco Bells I have been to.  I will continue to make a \"run for the border\" whenever a fast food taco craving hits."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude. My husband and I tried to order through the drive-thru. The employee said \"is that it?\" after each item and was increasingly obnoxious. When we didn't pull up to the window as fast as he wanted us to, he leaned out of the window, shook his arms at us and shut the window (we were driving a normal speed through the drive-thru).  When we got to the window, he screwed up the order and shut the window on us. So my husband went inside to speak to a manager, and the kid at the drive-thru literally ran away and hid. The person who claimed to be the \"manager\" was also a teenager who could not have cared less. So after waiting over a half an hour in the drive-thru, we left with no dinner and no desire to return to this location."}
{"text":"They just opened so I decided to stop by. I mean being new things shouldn't be to bad, right. Boy was I wrong, the place was dirty and in disarray. Trash was everywhere, people were everywhere, the cashier had no idea what he was doing (well 50/50) etc. However the food came out pretty fast and was pretty fresh. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and saying it's because everyone is new. Train the staff better, keep the dinning room and parking lot clean and things should get batter. Oh, almost forgot almost every single drink I tried had a after taste and maybe it's me but all the furniture in the store seemed very low, almost like for little people. LoL"}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has always been great until today when they rushed so fast that they didnt even bother to make the food right. How do you mess up something as easy as a regular taco. By the time I got home and down to the last taco in my potato rito box, I noticed my taco was kinda small and all it was was a shell with a little bit of meat on it. So I tried to call them but no one ever answers the phone and they dont have an answering machine. Im leaving this review cause im not satisfied and im not about to waste my gas to go back there just to replace a taco that would cost approx the same amount in gas just to make the round trip. Some advice, check your food before leaving the window and dont bother if it waste their average drive thru time cause getting the meals right is what's more inportant."}

Glenn Bell Jr. died this past weekend at the tender age of 86...a long life of slingin' taco's to be sure:)

I hadn't been to Taco Bell in almost 4 years, until today...I was moved to drop by Taco Bell in a sort of tribute to Glenn...one of the more prominent \"voices\" during my formative years:)

This Taco Bell in particular...store # 22354 is one of the more important spiritual touch points for paying tribute to Glenn...Scottsdale was the home of the first Taco Bell franchise (and the fact that Westaco, Inc's. HQ is in the same lot with this store makes them the defacto, if not actual, heir to the legacy of Glenn Bell:)

I had my first Taco Bell taco in Corvallis, Oregon in 1970 when I hit college with a mighty crash:)

It was the second time I had ever had \"Mexican\" food..the first time was a week prior at a place called Taco Time in Eugene, Oregon.

I was thrilled to find out about pizza, Italian food, pizza, Mexican, pizza, chinese take out, pizza...you get the drift...I was a country boy in the (for me) big city and I was going to find out all about life's pleasures...starting with taco's:)

I was hooked on Taco Bell for a long time (a time that, coincidentally, was the time when I had very little money yet still needed to eat occasionally:)

Taco Bell and the others filled the role of reasonably tasty maintenance eating for a long, long time...it was a truism in 1975 that no one...no one... could eat $5.00 worth of Taco Bell at a sitting, all by themselves:)

Could.Not.Be. Done!

It may still be \"truish\" with the \"cheapo\" menu:)

But it has never really been very good:(

That was something I actually didn't discover until a trip to LA with a girlfriend (the same trip that I discovered In-n-Out:)...real Mexican food is very different than the goop that Glenn had sold me over the years...and very much better:)

But that didn't stop me from eating at Taco Bell...beggars can't be chooser's...and I was a beggar for a few years.

Today was a nostalgia stop for me (as was my last visit to a Taco Bell a few years ago), as well as a tribute to Glenn:)

I was more interested in watching my \"beefy burrito\" being made this time...the ladies in the kitchen pulled various levers in response to the computerized instructions for my order on the monitors overhead...the different shades of unidentifiable goop that cascaded onto the flour tortillas...the quick hand movements of their ritual wrapping of the burrito (I once dated a girl that worked at Taco Bell...she knew how to wrap a burrito...but that's another story:)

It still isn't very good food...but everyone at this location is sweet and pleasant, my order was correct, I was in severe need of a retox after a 6 miler this morning and I did manage to eat about 2/3 of the burrito...even with mulitple \"bags\" of hot sauce it was not very good:(

But that's not the fault of the sweet ladies behind the counter, nor of Westaco, nor of Glenn Bell...I think when Pepsi or YUM or whoever got their hands on Taco Bell...well...I'm not writing this to get on a rant about corporate agendas vs. quality:)

I wanted to give them an extra star...just for being who they are and where they are, but I hear the spirit of Glenn Bell telling me \"don't do it, Donald...make them earn it\" :-)

That's all I need, another voice in my head...Thanks Glenn:)"}
{"text":"A Taco Bell is a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell. Or is it?  This location is a favorite. It's close by. They are consistent. They are quick. I love me anything volcano. I wish they had the pizza hut with it."}
{"text":"I'm only here for lunch, but it always seems like the cashier on during the lunch rush is new/not the usual person so ordering is slow and pretty much every time something is at least slightly wrong. Nice staff, decently clean, apologetic about having to remake food."}
{"text":"I've had night and day experiences at this location - seriously, during lunch and then late night.  During the day, their staff is super friendly (dare I say too much friendly sometimes?) and their service is fast. I might almost give them 4 stars. But this past weekend, I got sucked in by marketing for their Smothered Burrito and drove through around midnight. They had no non-sweet-tea (I go half-and-half usually, sorry I am not from the South!) and in spite of ordering a beef burrito, having the manager who was running the drivethru then ask me beef, chicken or steak (beef!) and my receipt saying beef... I ended up with Chicken. Guess I should stick to the day shift for my nacho cheese addition!"}
{"text":"Service at this Taco Bell is really SLOW!!!!!.   I ordered 4 taco's and 1 combo number 1.    It took 20 minutes from time of order (inside) to get food.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!"}
{"text":"Ok I did give them a fussy order but I didn't think it was so difficult they wouldn't get it right after multiple repetitions. But they were friendly and corrected the errors.  The building looks great, as if freshly painted, which was nice to see."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is a guilty pleasure of mine, I admit.  Typically, I leave missing at least one item I have ordered (even if I only order two items); however, this location off of Dobson/Southern in Mesa has never let me down. 

The service is usually fairly quick and the employees I've encountered have all been very nice, speak English and are always ready to give me any sauce I need.

Keep it up, Taco Bell.  My stomach and wallet thank you repeatedly."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed on the lack of customer service here. The lady (who I believe is the manager) was beyond rude and disrespectful. My friend went up to order and waited for her to come and take it and she said, I quote \"what do you want now\" in a very sarcastic and rude attitude. I needed a drink so I went up there and she said to me, I quote \"is there something else you want now?\". As I walk away, the lady behind me started to order and the so on so \"manager\" legit yells \"DO WE HAVE THE NACHO CHEESE\". When I say she yelled it I mean it echoed throughout the restaurant. I used to come to this Taco Bell a lot but after tonight, no more!"}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell for years and is one of the o my fast foods I eat.  This location I was excited about but every order in the last 8 visits they got wrong.  Wrong ingredients, wrong orders, sour cream on everything.  It seems like they don't know the menu and just throw whatever together and it should be good. I will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"It's taco bell. The food is okay! They are open till 1:00 am and they can replace meat with beans which is good for vegetarians!

They have both Pepsi and Dr peppers in case you care for any of that."}
{"text":"All things considered, this location gave us some really ridiculously greasy tacos, but did make it right on our next visit. The whole order that we complained about was just disappointingly bad--slippery softshells and soggy hardshells--and something has to be done. See my previous revisions for more details.
The staff is friendly, and I would say mostly (key word: \"mostly\") proficient at their job. The manager saw to it that we were taken care of and on our two visits where our food was not patently awful, it was actually good. So if I'm in the neighborhood, and want a taco, I'll probably stop in.
Actually, I'll go through the drive-through, because the place still smelled like there was a sewer problem after a week, with no sign posted to apologize or indication they were working on it. So it's not a place I'd ever actually linger whilst eating."}
{"text":"We decided we needed to try the nacho fries. They're not bad, a little skimpy, but decent flavor. The rest of our food was just gross, there's not really another word to describe it. The kids couldn't even stomach the tacos. My Mexican Pizza looked super weird and was inedible. Hubby got a steak burrito with 3 pieces of meat. Three. All in all, we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Slowest drive through ever. Seriously taking a minimum of 5-7 minutes per car.

Not sure what is going on but this is causing several cars to pull out and head to Wendy's."}
{"text":"I've never been more disgusted by the state of a taco bell. I've gotten sick there twice and I'm never going back to this one. When I walked in it smelled like something burning. Half of the restaurant was closed off by trash cans. You could see how unclean the kitchen was. And the employees were so rude. They were careless with how they prepared my food. Flicking it together and letting food scraps drop on the floor. Now I like taco bell a lot. I would eat there all the time if I this taco bell wasn't so terrible."}
{"text":"Closest TB to my house, go here about 1-2 times a month. Food is better than average for a Taco Bell. Never had a problem. Quality and portions tend to be better during the day."}
{"text":"I think there are a bunch of retards working there. Every single time I go there every time! They always forget something of mine and I go without one item that I ordered and paid for. I was dining in the other day and after 30 mins went to the register to ask where my food was and they told me THEY forgot!!???!??? How do you forget to make an order when I have an order number on my receipt?!?? So fine I sit back down and wait another 10 mins go back and they forgot again!!!!! I was furious!! I demanded a refund immediately and told them they are absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Johnny was awesome! Even during a busy time, he got our food out fast and was very friendly! He has wonderful costumer service!"}
{"text":"Had the new Doritos taco supreme. Mmmm it was good a bit much on the sour cream but good. The place seems clean, I even saw 2 groups of people dining in. The people that make the food were average young people i didnt see anything dirty, but its not like i stuck my head in stared as they prepared my food...

I must have a strong stomach since its been 3 hrs and I'm ok.. 
Maybe people are just over critical? Or it just seems like the type of people to always have a grudge against fastfoods somehow ends up rating it... Pretty much disgusted before even walking in... Its taco bell what did u expect? If you are the type of person that gets sick from eating at here in the first place no matter where u go, or have a bad attitude to begin with please dont drag the rest down with you. Anyways hopes this helps.

- just cuz im lactose tolerant... Should i rate the milk bad?"}
{"text":"Um wow.... I was not expecting this many negative reviews.... we come here at least twice a week and we have never had any problems. The workers are all pretty friendly, and the food is almost always accurate. (I mean come on every once in a while they are going to mess an order up.... they have a billion people coming in and ordering food every day.) Just take it for what it is.... a taco bell. Don't expect authentic homemade food, just expect Americanized Mexican fast food served hot and fresh and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I have been coming here very frequently since January 2013. Yeah, there are occasionally some stupid people who come in, but for the most part this is a nice place... when they are really busy, they might not have everything perfectly spotless, but what place does when they have 30 people standing in line and another 10 sitting at the tables eating their food? They have changed managers and a lot of the staff had left and they got new people working there, and they are always friendly. As for the food..... it's your average taco bell, if you like it then you do if you don't then don't bash this particular taco bell because you don't like any of them."}
{"text":"Although this seems like a much older Taco Bell in to need of remodeling the food never seems to suffer and the staff are generally friendly. They have diet Mountain Dew on tap which not all Taco Bell seem to have. This location is easy to get in and out of even during rush hour traffic times."}
{"text":"This is the worst most ghetto taco bell I have ever been unfortunate enough to live near. Terrible service almost every time. The employees are straight out of the pinta and take no pride in their work. Which is why they are working at taco bell to begin with. After getting cold stale tacos again I had enough, I actually drove back wanting something done replace refund something. That's how fkn bad their food is all the time. It is fast food this is how incompetent these people are. I go back and as the cashier (who was actually pretty good) is helping me I have three drop outs standing there laughing like its funny I had to waste my time coming back and by the way it is this idiots fault. The cashier agreed something is wrong with the shells and all I see is three snickering failures laughing. I got some  scrawny little twerp employee who trying to stare at me just begging to be bitch slapped.Hey stupid you havent accomplished shit you dont make shit and you dont own shit fkn little bitch teenager. Seriously If you are in Vegas with your family AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.It is in a dangerous area and it is not exceptional in any way, it is below average in every sense of the word. From the bums begging for change outside to the homeless people that will walk up to your car at night while you are in the drive thru to the non working A/ C unit in the dead of summer this place is all around fkn terrible. The substandard employees only make things worse. Fk this taco bell I will never ever go back to this pos location and I am an honest person telling you the straight up god dam truth fk this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic stack box, first bite of the tri-folded stack had my mouth watering with anticipation for the next bite. I went with the wide side first, the flakey yet chewy tortilla had the perfect amount of crunch when paired with the USDA angus beef and gourmet cheddar cheese stuffed inside this perfectly handcrafted quesadilla they call a stacker."}
{"text":"Drive thru is really all I use on the way to work, so I can't comment on the dining area. However the drive thru is always speedy and gets my order correct every time. Almost every person has a really great and friendly attitude at the window. Some of them have even recognized me and asked how I've been. This to me, is good service especially given the number of people they see each day. Love the country a.m. crunch wrap and steak scrambler to start the day."}
{"text":"******ZERO STARS******

Lunch hour is always not the most preferred time to come but oh well I decide to stop anyway. My problem is they forget part of my order.  You may say human error and yes that is completely understandable however, this is the second time this week that this has occurred with little to know concern. I continue to hear how there are so many new hires and they are young and that Is why they continue to forget to put items in the bag. Then they try and give me the item that was missed and now it's just been sitting there. Then the manager says okay we will remake everything. My daughter said mom let's just eat somewhere else because what if they spit in our food. Never really crossed my mind that an employee would do that. So they remake all the food and add an empanada for the inconvenience. So u decide let's check the order and the hard tacos has sour cream, tomatoes and I specifically asked for meat and cheese only. Needless to say if I ever want taco bell again I will drive 20 minutes out to get to a different location because this is just unacceptable on all accounts."}
{"text":"Taco bells are basically all of the same but avoid around the time high school / middle school let's out because it's full of very irritating teens- not even eating ! I'm addition to playing catch in the parking lot- ball missed my car but the teens thought it was okay to hang out sitting on mine & other peoples trunks!"}
{"text":"cashier shorted me 5 dollars I caught it when I got home called they pulled the drawer and found my 5 I didn't live down the street from this location so I said I would pick it up in a day or so. I came today which is maybe 2 days later. the manager said he would leave a note. when I arrived I spoke with the Manger on duty which didn't know so he called the guy I spoke with who com firmed my story when he came back he said oh I'll give it to you but you were supposed  to get it that day. So I'm guessing that they put a time frame on when you can pick up your money that there no counting ass cashiers fuck up on if I didn't come back I know they would have pocketed it no good POS."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Taco Bell in the Parma/Cleveland area. They always get my order right and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Taco Bell, Taco Hell... Call it what you want but being able to get cheap, vegan-friendly eats at a drive-thru is a simple yet rare pleasure.  Taco Bell is extremely veg-friendly and this location always delivers solid and fresh (ish) food.  Just be sure to double-check your order; they do tend to mess up from time to time."}
{"text":"The price of what I ordered was different on their menu and when I said something she said she would give it to me at that price and I thought she did until I saw the receipt and she didn't! Not ok to overcharge me!

I forgot that I had problems before.. I went and ordered a Fritos burrito- rang up $1.19- but is clearly on the menu under the $1 cravings menu- I said it was the wrong price and all I got was 'uhhhhhh'... Double check the prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I drive by this Taco Bell it has a huge drive thru line. So now Taco Bell has happy hour between 2-5pm but... The catch is supposedly u have to tell them it's happy hour cuz they can't and don't care what time it is. I told the guy I was charged full price for my drink which was supposed to be $1 and he told me I have to tell them it's happy hour. I said I thought they did it automatically like sonic does but they don't I guess... I asked him for a extra drink to compensate, the guy ROLLS his EYES at ME!!! He was very rude! Not to meantion they also got my burrito wrong! Ugh!!"}
{"text":"A tragic attempt at dinner....  I ordered the new steak quesalupa and it had an eighth of an inch of steak while the remaining 3 inches of the \"taco\" was lettuce.  Seriously that's what 5 bucks gets you???  I would have been \"ok\" with a third of the taco being steak, but that little?!  Come on Taco Bell, you can do better!!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell will probably always rate a 3 star in my book.  It's A-Ok.  

This location gets a star lower because I almost had to get a refill on my large pop by the time I left the drive through.  I waited 10 minutes...in the drive through...for tacos.  Life just moves slower in Steelyard, I guess."}
{"text":"This taco not only got a Baja blast the drink wrong and gave us a frozen one, but also proceeded to not give us a cinnamon twist and no receipt. They closed the window on us when they gave us our drink and turned their backs on us not asking if we had gotten everything that we need.. I highly recommend the taco shop in the same plaza (mi casita) which has top notch service and great food."}
{"text":"Compared to CT, this Taco Bell was super fresh. The tomatoes were really cold but at least it all felt very fresh. Well done Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Arrived to get a quick breakfast during work break (working since 2am)...arrived at 7:05am. Sign on door says open at 7am. Door locked. Two people at counter look up and indicate they aren't open and not going to unlock the door to do anything. Taking breakfast business elsewhere and not considering Taco Bell anymore in any city."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, typical Taco Bell food.  I do like this location because the staff has always been very polite and friendly.  Again, I like the cleanliness to this restaurant.  Not really much else to say since it's a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I ordered my tacos supreme..... the drive through screen said supreme.... my tacos should be supreme right? No. Apparently not. They didn't give me my receipt either so I couldn't take them back."}
{"text":"I'm not really big on Mexican fast food but in a pinch they do a pretty good job. This location is pretty nice easy to get in and out of plus lots of parking. If you don't want to get out of your car they have a drive thru window. I get items from the dollar menu and there actually pretty good. As Taco Bell's go this one is a pretty good."}
{"text":"I like this location. Never had an issue. The staff are young but have always been pleasant. The food has always been good and the place is clean as a taco bell can be. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly counter person. The menu could be so much simpler. There are so many items it takes a long time to read thru it to find what you want and the descriptions are too limited & don't contain ALL the ingredients on the items. Case in point the Steak Quesadilla has a mayonnaisey hot sauce on it which is not mentioned on the menu."}
{"text":"This location has very poor customer service.  They rarely get orders correct, so double check before you drive away.  Also, although their drive thru menu clearly states they serve regular menu at 9:00 am they say they do not serve it until 11:00 am.  Do not question this!  If you do you will be treated rudely by the person taking orders!!  Just back away slowly and don't make eye contact."}
{"text":"Terrible location. Staffed seemingly entirely by teenagers that are much more concerned with socializing with their friends that are there dining than actually helping customers. I've even seen them chasing each other outside and screaming. Makes for an annoying and unpleasant experience eating there. Orders are incorrect 50% of the time both in the drive thru and inside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Bell location. Pretty quick and can easily get back on the 95. I always check my order and id say they get it correct 80% of the time. Good for Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Mouse droppings in food... Found out by biting... Disgusting sickening and ruined vegas trip due to subsequent diarrhea - this place should be shut down! Ordered chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"Zero stars would be given if that were possible. They need to seriously get rid of the creepy ass drive thru attendant who thinks it's cool to act funny with his voice. Such a turn off and will never be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I went to this location tonight and ordered food. The guy who took my order got the order wrong. I told the shift manager, Matt, and he fixed the problem immediately. Furthermore, he was polite and had good manners which was a plus. Thank you, Matt!"}
{"text":"The lady manager is great! So nice and helpful! The guy taking the order was more worried about flexing his fake watch then getting half our order wrong . But the nice very polite and helpful manger help us get everything right ."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER ! I wish I could rate no stars., they messed up my order, the order in front of me and the one behind me! How hard is it too put no sour cream and nachos . And then we pull back around to the window and he was like I'm going to give you these but we don't appreciate rude customers . I DONT appreciate my food being cold and soggy And I keep going back and I don't know why. I'm going too call corporate . Hopefully that assholes losing her job."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru on 7/1/15.  The worst experience I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Order was wrong, got major attitude and insults.  Asked us to pay the difference for their mistake and both woman (animals) started name calling me.  So disrespectful.  And they want 15.00 an hr?!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say they had BAD customer service; I would say they had NO customer service. 

After ordering my food through the drive-thru the guy working the window seemed legitimately confident. He took my order: #4 Mexican pizza, substitute beef on the Pizza and the tacos for beans. And change the hard tacos to softshell tacos. Add two shredded chicken soft tacos with chicken, beans and sour cream only. 

I confirmed that the order I gave him was repeated back to me properly. But when handed my food at the window, thankfully, I double checked the shredded chicken tacos for accuracy. They were wrong. 

There was lettuce, cheese and tomatoes on both of them. 

The drive-thru line was backed up and waiting on me. Never did the employee at the window apologize for the mistake. Instead the woman that made the food came to the drive-they to convince me that she made the order correctly. 

So I dig through the tacos and showed her they were wrong. I literally pointed out the lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. I also showed her my receipt that said NO lettuce, NO cheese and NO tomatoes. 

She raised her voice and said, she was not wrong. She made them right. 

Impolitely she took the tacos back and corrected them, without any apology or acknowledgement of the time she had wasted of ours and the long line of customers behind me."}
{"text":"I go here quite often and it's always been a good experience, regardless of whether I go inside or hit the drive-thru. The employees are so friendly and helpful. I have yet to have a poorly made item."}
{"text":"Every time I go through the drive thur late night I am always treated very well. Ryan and Andrew I believe are the workers at night. They make me always wanting to come back and go out of my way to come to this location."}
{"text":"Unfortunately in terms of food and service, this Taco Bell has a wide margin for doing better. The drive through is slow, and you always need to check to make sure you have everything you ordered before driving off. This place forgot to give us what my boyfriend ordered, and fortunately he checked and noticed, so we had to wait even longer for his food to arrive. 

In terms of food quality, it's fairly low on the spectrum of fast food. Meat taste dry, and my tacos always look like they're about to fall apart if they haven't already. The bottom of the shells were torn, and the ingredients never seem fresh. Even the lemonade drink that I got did not taste good.

Honestly, if there's nothing else open and you don't mind the long wait for low quality food, then check out this Taco Bell. Otherwise, I'll pass on coming to this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Bell in Henderson. The crew is usually pretty nice. They are quick with your order, and they seem to get along pretty well. 

Your order is pretty much correct every time. Some of the Taco Bell's seem to be inconsistent with the food portions. Not this place. Every taco is about the same size with the same amount of fillings. That's good for the nacho platters, as well. I hate when I order 4 tacos from other locations, and there's so little filling, I'm still hungry for a 5th or 6th taco.

My only big gripe, as like with most Taco Bells in Henderson/Vegas, there's too many \"homeless\" people sitting inside, watching you eat your tacos like my dog watches me eat anything. If they're not eating, they need to be kicked out."}
{"text":"Dear Taco Bell, 

I've supported you throughout the last 4 decades. I try everything you come up with, no matter how greasy, fatty, or un-mexican it has been. I even tried your burrito wrapped taco, which I should've suspected would taste like your taco wrapped burrito, which tastes like your crunchwrap, which tastes like your Diet Pepsi. 

I draw the line with these weird high-school-paper-study-hall-note-shaped chicken triangles(See photo). I want my dollar 99 back.

This location is of average ordering/serving speed for a Taco Bell, and the employees are overall pleasant if you don't engage in conversation with them. LOT's of bums hanging out here every time I'm here. Maybe I'm one of em? I can't tell anymore."}
{"text":"Not worth one star. Cold, hardly any chicken, crunchy taco, soft. Shift manager rude, laughed at me.. plus corporate did nothing. Why did I complain, serve and overall food quality has to improve in this city. I know its a take out but still... Rubio's is my fav, up the street."}
{"text":"I got to this location after a long day of work without eating expecting the store hours to correlate to the stores actual hours that they would operate by. I got to this location 20 minutes before their drive through was supposed to be closed and when I can there all of the lights are turned off when I pull in, I drive up to the window to see what was the reason for them being closed with non of the staff looking at me or helping me and they blatantly ignored me and walked away. I've always loved Taco Bell, but after this experience I don't feel welcomed as a customer and will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"\"Think outside the bun\" - usually only when I am starving and only have $3 to my name. But to do right by TB I have to say they do make a mean Mexican pizza.

Since I only usually go to this location there are some things I can say about it.

1) Service is always friendly and extremely fast!
2)Prices are great (hope it is actually human consumable)
3) Decent Mexican tasting food

So, when in doubt, do not go without - go with Taco Bell instead!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly every time we visit. Our order has never been wrong, and we occasionally get a free frozen slushie drink. Even if we happen to get a wrong order in the future, we would most likely return because the staff are so nice!!"}

{"text":"this has got to be the slowest service in a drive through I've ever seen.  period.  this is after three visits.  the staff is slow and don't seem to care at all.  I sat in the drive through and  literally watched ten cars go through the Hardee's drive through next door in that time."}
{"text":"As a fast food restaurant you can't really expect much. I've been to many different taco bells and they all seemed decent. Good service and good food. This one in the Laveen area has to be the worst. Why? Bad, rude employees who have the worst attitude ever. A young Hispanic chick who was is her 20's had the guts to roll her eyes at me when I asked for extra sauce. Geez how hard is it to get more sauce. It's not like I'm asking for gold here."}
{"text":"OK, I think the person running this place has got the magic touch OR they need to drug test the employees.  Service today was awesome for a Taco Bell.  Everyone was nice, smiling, helpful.  Thank you for bringing back good customer service...you rock!!!"}
{"text":"this taco bell has left my tummy thoroughly satisfied and my every desire completed.. great customer service, precision, and accuracy. fresh and delicious. 10 Stars Congrats How Ave Taco Bell"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be rating a generic fast food joint yet here I am doing just that. 

Look, I'm not going to talk about the food here. I don't have the most discerning palate when it comes to generic fast food. What I will talk about is the great service they have here. The drive-thru employees are so sweet! I never expected so much good-natured politeness from a fast food joint. What's even better is that they've never forgotten any parts of my order. I really appreciate this place for reminding me to smile."}
{"text":"My mom wanted taco bell the other night, so we stopped in for a quick bite and I don't think I will be back. The location seemed dirty. I ordered the cheese nachos and was very disgusted when the order came out. They were on the typical fast food tray, but unfortunately there was no tray liner. I have seen how \"clean\" those trays are so needless to say I didn't eat the chips that rolled out on the tray. Lucky for me...when you order the nachos you don't get enough cheese for all the chips anyways, so I was still able to finish the cheese."}
{"text":"Well, it started off well... As I was walking up to the door, an employee about to go on break stopped and held the door open for me. That was nice and, frankly, a notch above the service one expects or usually gets at a fast food joint.  Unfortunately, that all went to hell the moment I walked in the door.

There was only one other customer in the place and his facial expression - that borderline look between frustration & constipation - should have tipped me off.  There were two employees in the cook line as they were so engrossed in their conversation that they didn't see or hear me come in.  Despite my \"Excuse me's\" & audible sighs they didn't bother to acknowledge me. One of these ladies was a manager.  The other one, working the line, had plastic gloves on but kept touching her shirt as she stood there making the food order in between squeaking with the manager.

I wasn't acknowledged until the drive thru girl came out of the bathroom still zipping up her pants.  When she finally asked if I had been helped yet, I politely said, \"No, and I've changed my mind.\"

The customer that was there when I walked in, who was still waiting for his food order, started laughing out loud as I walked out.  Sad, actually, if you stop to consider that he was actually going to eat the food that the gloved employee that kept touching her shirt was making for him...

Not coming back to this Taco Bell - ever!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Taco Bell! Although I have noticed the difference of night shift and day shift. What I mean by that is this place is better to hit up at night because the food is made properly to where as in the morning my food seems a bit skimped. Cheesy gordita crunch gang for life!"}
{"text":"So - left Taco Bell about an hour ago. The girl at the window is talking about how if she doesn't get the manager promotion, she's going to find something else..meanwhile, she hands me our bag and says.  Six items have a nice night.  We get home - no - 4 items, missing 2.  Manager?  You be the judge."}
{"text":"Terrible quality food even for taco bell. Order is rarely ever correct. Apparently open until midnight means open until some time before 11:30  or whenever the closing manager gets tired of working."}
{"text":"I'm going to go on a limb here and say that this is the best Taco Bell that I've ever been to. I've always held other Taco Bell restaurants in other places to the standard of this one and recently I returned to see if my memory had been too kind; it hadn't (this one really is that good)."}
{"text":"This is the best Taco Bell in the area. I've been addicted to The Bell for years and like to enjoy it every now and then. This place is open early and closes late which works great for someone who's freelance work hours are all over the place like mine. The food is always accurate and fast. If I'm in a mood for Taco Bell ill be sure to come to this location."}
{"text":"This is my first ever yelp review. Let me start by saying that I actually like Taco Bell in general, but this was by far the worst experience I've had. I flew into Ohio late this evening and when I got to my hotel I just needed something fast, Taco Bell was the only thing nearby. Even though it says they close at 11pm, when I walked in at 9:45 the cashier was rushing to lock the door, she let me in, but actually told me that she didn't want to let me order and it was clear that she just wanted me to leave so that everyone could leave early. I ordered a few things to go, but the quality was so terrible, even by Taco Bell standards, and I immediately felt sick to my stomach. I'm writing this while actually still on the toilet. Do not go to this Taco Bell under any circumstances."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst fast food restaurant I have been to. I live close by and have been here several times. It is painfully slow every single time. 

I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it took 15 minutes for me to get my food. The food itself is fine but the service is horrible. I don't think I can handle coming here anymore."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell, so let's be real, they can't get more than 3/5 stars. The place was hardly clean for being there late night (the floors needed to be mopped) , but the food was served quickly. So, egh."}
{"text":"Poor management and inadequate employee training. The manager Jared Warn is very unprofessional in handling issues with employees/trainees. Instead of letting them know what they may be doing wrong, makes them clock out and sit out (without giving a reason why) and then fires them the next day without providing a real reason, warning or a chance to improve, when none of the other managers had any problems. No one goes into a job, especially a minimum wage one, already knowing everything and being able to multi-task, and 7 hours is definitely not enough time to learn all the skills and perfect them. If you don't really want to take the time to train, you need to let the employees know up front and maybe someone with a few years of experience will sign up!"}
{"text":"Literally the longest wait I've ever had at a fast food restaurant. I timed my husband and I to prove a point. I went to a TB 10 minutes away and he went to this one. I was home and done eating by the time he got there. The ONLY reason why I gave it two stars is because my order is always correct."}
{"text":"I was really irritated because i said no cheese on my order, and the screen said NO CHEESE and ya girl with a dairy allergy got a mouthful of cheese. thanks taco bell for another explosive diarrhea"}
{"text":"Well it is a Taco Bell. 

Parking lot is plentiful and the location is in a great spot. It's very clean and staff is friendly.

The only downfall is that the drive-thru is extremely slow. With that said, my order never has had any issues so I don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Went back. Food was good this time. Not enough meat on the double chalupa."}
{"text":"By far without a doubt the worst Taco Bell I've been to between North Carolina and South Carolina!  The only positive was my order was accurate.  As for the negative, NONE OF THE TABLES WERE CLEAN!!!  THERE WAS FOOD EVERYWHERE!!!  I had to take napkins myself and clean off the table I wanted to sit at.  Looking around at ALL the other tables, there was food on them.  F'ing gross!  I'm not paid to clean tables so why do I have to?!?!  AND the place was slow.  How much effort would it really take for an employee to wipe down tables?!?!?!?!?  Food on the floor is way more acceptable than food on a table.

On a side note, I was there for lunch around 1:45pm and the average ago of the customer was 95.  This would be normal for Golden Coral but Taco Bell???  I don't get it....

This location isn't near my house so I won't frequent it on a regular basis but if I lived in Indian Trail, NC, I'd drive to Washington State before I eat at this Taco Bell location again."}
{"text":"I eat here more than I like to admit in public.  Mainly because there is such a limited selection of vegan options around nellis AFB.  Gotta love the Ghetto and the junk food that comes with it. Lucky for me their beans are vegan. Can I get a whole foods out here please?

But back on point.  This is probably the best taco bell in the Valley for lunch.  All the tables are always clean, service is prompt, and orders are always made right if you are there when the manager is present or during lunch hours.  I know places don't have their A team work late night, and the quality shows if your getting a burrito fix after the sun goes down.

One cashier kind of rubs me the wrong way due to an unprofessional attitude, haven't seen her in a few days so she may have been reassigned or fired, but again...  It's a taco bell.  

All in all, great during the day, but quality slips later in the night, so 4 stars, rather than 5."}
{"text":"Drive thru. Order food ask for hot sauce. Drive away 

3 packs of sauce. Really!?


Bean burrito with. A Few uncooked rice"}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars I would. Obviously food is not taste tested before it's served. Shell of fiesta taco salad and Mexican pizza was incredibly bitter, absolutely inedible,  yet they didn't have a care in the world when I brought it back. I asked the \"manager\" to taste one of the shells yet he tried a chip that was fried in something separate. Smart. Maybe things aren't being cleaned properly? Maybe they're using super old fry oil? Whatever it may be, it is extremely careless and had no right to be served. I realize you're only making 10 an hour but come on. Do your job or find a new one."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but seriously...the best Taco Bell I've ever been to. I live in California, and from Arizona so I've seen my share of them and from the perfectly orderly fashioned line of sauces to the freshest tasting taco I've ever had. I had to talk to the manager and and compliment the team. Till next time Henderson...
Danny Bernard"}
{"text":"Waited for ONE HOUR in the drive thru to get our food. Absolutely ridiculous. I have never had an experience like this before. If you don't have the capacity to stay open late and be efficient- just close early. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Always get the runs here. I don't think the meat gets cooked fully. They need to practice defrosting procedures better."}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly.  There's a sign on the wall saying it's a certified training facility, and they do a wonderful job.  Sadly I've never seen customer service like this at another TB around the valley.  Order is ALWAYS correct and I order some complicated, add this take this off, they always get it right.

While here on this trip I noticed that the 'large' cups that come with the meal have shrunk!  Fountain Mt Dew is one of my guilty pleasures and when I go for TB it's a double treat, I was a bit saddened but realize I sure don't need the bit of dew I was missing!"}
{"text":"The manager is very rude!
Tried to ask a question, and she just kept repeating the same answer.
Also yelling at the employee by the register.
Please replace her. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Alright place the service here is okay and the area is not so good. Customer service needs help here definitely"}
{"text":"have never been to this location.  food came out pretty fast and was the usual taco Bell fare.  went to sit down and all of the tables were dirty.  picked the least dirty one."}
{"text":"Wtf?! Out of beans, beef, and chicken. What the hell is the assistant manager doing all day? How do you not have the main components to 90% of your food items?? And to top it off, the incompetent worker sounded medicated and like she didn't know what to say. Really? Fine, I don't blame you, dumb girl, I blame your shitty manager. What  a poorly ran establishment."}
{"text":"Yes, it's Taco Bell..and we all know we get that craving every once in a while.
This location is conveniently located near me so I have stopped in a few times, but unfortunately the service is horrible I think I may make a longer drive to a different location because it is better there.

The food is okay here and unfortunately I seem to get skimped on meat sometimes, especially when I order the Nachos...my favorite item.
So, overall, take a ride over to the south end location, food and service is so much better!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving Taco Bell this is my preferred location. Service is always spot on and I have never had any issues with my orders or being skimped on meat.
Taco Bell was one of my favorite fast food joints in high school and I love that even as an adult I can still get the same food that I loved at that time, Nachos, Taco Pizza and the Taco Supreme!"}
{"text":"I've never provided a Yelp review but I feel compelled to write one now.  Tonight we waited 30 minutes in the drive thru for our order. And when we got it, it was missing items. We certainly weren't going to go back to get our missing items. The poor girl at the window was apologetic which was nice until I read the other reviews only to find that this is common occurrence. This is an owner problem. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place sucks. It reflects the ghetto area surrounding it. The cashiers are loud and annoying and don't have a trace of customer service etiquette  And I'm pretty sure some of them actually bring their kids to work with them...expecting customers to babysit them. 

There is almost always some weird, drunken derelict sitting near the restrooms. And the teenagers that hang around are always talking trash about other people they know."}
{"text":"I always have issues at this Taco Bell. Every time my boyfriend says no sour cream they add it...even when the receipt says no sour cream. Last time I ordered for my boyfriend the latest $5 box. From sitting in my car the picture looked like it had sour cream in it. So I said no sour cream. Well it was some kind of avocado ranch or something. Well I get home and there's the ranch but what I thought was sour cream. So I go back and spent 10 minutes explaining to the drive thru girl and then the cook that I didn't want sour cream. They kept trying to tell me but it doesn't have sour cream. Which okay it's not sour cream but none of those idiots explained that to me. If the drive thru girl would have explained to me it was ranch when I said no sour cream the whole ordeal would have been avoided."}
{"text":"I would come here a lot as a kid because this was one of the closest taco bells around.  The reason this lonely taco bell has such a good rating is the quality of food and the service.  One of the managers Isaiah R. was really cool and friendly.  Its Taco Bell so you know the food but surprisingly it taste better here than most taco bells.

The location is on the corner of flamingo and decatur.  decent size parking lot and its inside of a mini mall.  Drive thru is pretty quick especially late night and again everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, the lady taking my order and Manager Hortencia were so very rude.  I've never experienced such bad customer service in my life!   I would recommend avoiding this restaurant go anywhere else."}
{"text":"If I could go for no stars - this place would be it!

Our order was for take out. Waited 15 minutes for our order, along with everyone else. Than once we received, I glanced in to the 3 bags - all looked good and we headed out.

Got home and we didn't have L2 or L3 and ended up with 2 ears of corn, dozen hush puppies, and not what we ordered. 

Returned waited again just for someone to help me - was given correct order, was never compensated or apologized to.

We were not the only one with an incorrect order. There were 3 other people around us that were given the wrong order. Only the man in the Postal out fit got comped his meal, amazing!

Not going back again - it's just too frustrating."}
{"text":"I'm done with this Taco bell! Their burrito supremes are smaller than everyone else's bean burrito! Smallest I've ever seen,  and it gets worse every time I go in.  It sucks because this is super close to my house.  Oh well,  Del Taco it is! Plus they don't have regular iced tea."}
{"text":"never get stuck in the drive thru lane line. you will be there for 20-30 minutes especially at dinner. i live 5 minutes away and have been coming here for 3 years. same shi* every time. i try and avoid this taco bell. i drive to the one 15 minutes away from me just to avoid this waste of time establishment. 

you guys need to work on your shi*."}
{"text":"never had to wait so fuc*ing long in my life for drive thru. vegas local and love taco bell but this one sucks so bad. never ever go here took me almost 20 minutes with only 2 cars in front of me. disaster. they don't care at all here about you."}
{"text":"Why does it take 20 minutes to get through the drive thru every time? At this point I should just go to a Mexican restaurant. They are much faster!"}
{"text":"The food is gonna be what the food is gonna be, you know that.
So I judge a FFchain on a few things.
Is it clean.
Are they friendly.
Do they fahqew in the drive thru?

This Taco Hell scores consistently mediocre on all counts, except that they are quite friendly.

It is refreshing to pull into the drive thru, and even if there were a line of cars ahead of you, to hear the mechanical voice in the box say, 
\"Hi, How are you?\"
...and then pause for an answer!

They do it all the time, so must be made to say it, but it always seems sincere.  It catches you off guard at first, but now I have grown to really dig the tone it conveys.  I don't think that the couple of seconds it may delay the order is a big deal at all, compared to the warm fuzzy feelings I get when I respond, 
\"I'm fine. How are you?\"...and get a genuine response back.

I'm not here that often, but more since they demolished the Del Taco across the street to build a CVS freestanding location (good call, since the strip mall CVS in that shopping ctr is gross).

I have noticed that there are several employees that seem to have stuck around and worked here for well over a year, maybe two -- good sign when you're judging a FFchain, since turnover = non-caring employees.

So in summary:
It's clean enough.
They're quite friendly.
They haven't yet fahq'd me in the drive thru.

Edited:

Meh for food.
Yay! I'm a fan for friendliness.

According to my personal rating system that's much too complicated to show here, this equates to an A-OK overall."}
{"text":"It's sad that I am reviewing a taco bell, but this was the worst one I have ever been to. We stopped at this Taco Bell on our way home from Las Vegas. It was about 10:30-11:00 when we got there and all of the tables, ALL OF THEM, were dirty. Also, the floors and bathrooms (at least the womens) were dirty. I understand that it's a Sunday and many people are leaving Vegas, but to be honest... someone should have came out on the floor and cleaned off some of the tables. 

The food..... You may be thinking, it's taco bell you can't really rate the food. Look here. My husband ordered a \"Cheesy Gordita Crunch and a soft taco\". I ordered the #10. My meal turned out okay, wasn't the best put together meal I have seen at taco bell, but it seemed like there was nothing wrong with it.... but they put (what it looked like) two hard tacos on the plate. My husband thought they forgot his Cheesy Gordita Crunch (one may argue they did)... after going back up there and getting it, I began eating my hard taco.... come to find out they didn't put sour cream on it like I had requested and instead they put the sauce for the cheesy gordita crunch on it. After thinking about it for a second.... we realized that was the cheesy gordita crunch, HA they just didn't finish making it. 

All and all, I am rating this on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Also, the customer service was less than desirable. The cashier... to me.... was rude. She would give you 1 second to tell her what your name was before she would ask you again. 

We should have went to Panda."}
{"text":"I understand that I am reviewing a Taco Bell drive thru but man these guys are great. They are always so friendly and helpful. Always a smiling face at the window when I pull up. Quality of food is A+ Taco Bell food."}
{"text":"Thought i had found the motherfunkin' holy grail. Alas, it was a near miss. We had been meandering from Lake County all over the east side and ended up on Rockside around midnight. Then i saw the bright yellow light of Long John's and the neon purple of \"Drive Thru Open\". Could it be, my favorite meal at midnight! Even the dog was losing her shit. She knows the Long John's logo. The drive thru speaker asked for my order. I said \"L5- fish and more\". 

Response-  \"Long John's closes at 10, sir.\" @#$%^&!! Could have been five stars for you.
\"All right, nachos bell grande no meat.\" 
How do you close half of a store? Sorry, it turns out people don't want fish after ten, but they do want cow and chicken. Does the Dunkin Donuts/ Baskin Robbins have this issue? \"Yeah, you can get a donut, but our ice cream churner is sleeping.\" Whatevs. I proceeded to cruise the streets of Old Brooklyn while sharing nachos with the dog and wife and playing music on my phone. Good thing i have a knee to drive with. I think if i got pulled over that would be like a quadruple citation."}
{"text":"Worst T Bell in America. The people here are possibly dumber than the nimrods over at the Kamm's McDonald's(see my review). We have never left this location with the complete order we placed. Why do we keep coming here? I can't answer that. Maybe we're in Memento and suffer from memory loss. I don't know. My dog likes it though. It's like she knows the faux stucco of the drive thru equals some sort of meat and cheese. Hell, she could probably work here. It wouldn't be the first time an animal that licks itself wraps up your seven layer, people."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, and they get our order right time after time. Best Taco Bell in CLE+ in my opinion. Very friendly managers. Last time I went, we had a large order and the cashier made a recommendation for the taco 12 packs and we saved money."}
{"text":"Roses are Red
Violets are Blue,
I'd be truly honored,
tonight to dine with you

It won't be too fancy,
But conversation will be swell
I'll pick you up at 9
And we will dine at Taco Bell 

So I hope you can make it 
Good times are in order
Even if I fail to score 
I can say we went South of the Border....

Valentines day poem I crafted for my ladyfriend. 

I approached the staff valentines day evening and takes to Tracy, the drive through manager at this Taco Bell.  Tracy was amazing and helped me execute my plan to go through the drive through, complete a fake order and instead of 99 cent tacos I ordered for my bewildered date, presented champagne and a dozen roses ;).  

We then headed off to a white linen dinner fit for royalty. 

#zerotohero #underpromiseoverdeliver

The staff here was amazing and special thanks to Tracy for helping me create a memorable Vday!"}
{"text":"Lunch rush is horrible, took about 20 minutes for a crunch wrap and a taco.. the cashier was super nice! But service in the kitchen is super slow!"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient, tasty.... um, if you really need to read reviews about Taco Bell you probably need help."}
{"text":"As one of my visiting Seattle friends put it, \"This is one of the nicest Taco Bells I have ever seen.\"  However, I wish they could fix the video screen on the drive-thru :("}
{"text":"Pretty standard Taco Bell. Fast, cheap, tasty. They've never messed up my order. I did try to come here for breakfast once (got a free coupon) and they didn't have breakfast here. So that's weird. Also, they're not open 24 hours like all Taco Bells used to be. I believe they close around 1 on the weekends. Weird. You would think they would stay open until 3."}
{"text":"I come here often because it's near my work.  The staff is always friendly.  My orders are complicated because I basically customize everything I order.  99.9% of the time it's perfect.  I get extra cheese and easy beef which I guess can be different from person to person.  They have a manager, I believe her name is Tina, it seems like the employees like her and I have seen her jump on the food line or register to help out when it gets busy.  I come back here because of the service I get."}
{"text":"1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Its taco bell more can you say, this location seems always busy but quick in the drive thru, my food has always been fresh & hot. Those nacho fries have me coming back lol So the gimmicks that Taco Bell introduces every year or so are working. Anyone dump their fries in the mini chicken quesadilla?  Its heaven ha ha"}
{"text":"Lame. Got takeout, got home, they forgot part of the order. I had to go all the way back (because who doesn't want what they paid for??) and the manager gave me nothing extra for their screw-up. In fact, they messed up part of the order, too, and they didn't even let me keep the incorrect one! They threw it away! I never ask for extra stuff, but when you mess up that much, it's just a given you do something nice for the custimer. This manager was awful. She was a super overweight woman with dark hair who wasn't nice at all. In fact, she wanted to argue with me instead. I didn't feel like arguing or being mean, so I just left. And now here I am, letting everyone know how crappy of an experience I had."}
{"text":"I freaking love TB! Get baja dewski, it'll change your life if you let it."}
{"text":"Pretty good location, paid for sour cream for my double decker, but got none. For that, a 2 star. Otherwise I am sure it would be a 4. As I continue to come I will update the stars and reviews."}
{"text":"I have been to this Taco Bell thousands of times since I was just a boy at the tender age of 8. Will always remain my top pick for Taco Bell locations.
I will find the date and roughly the time tonight, but this location has given me the best double decker Taco that I have ever had in my life, my wife had to physically stop me from calling in a complimenting whoever made the double decker. Still wish that I would have because it was so gosh darn good. Thank you Taco Bell, for being such a wonderfully delicious option to all of us around the Stapley and McKellips area! You are cherished by all!"}
{"text":"Been here 3-4 times, and always something is wrong. Super slow service, insolent attitude, and consistently wrong orders (none of which were complicated or special requests!) One time went in, there was no other customer in line and we waited a solid 5-10 minutes to be helped. There was one employee clearly on his break and no one else paying any attention. When our order was taken, the employee was blasting music from his phone in his pocket. This location closes at 11, even on weekends and though it's near an area full of a lot of young people and late night bars. Often times the sign is out during open hours, which I suspect is not an accident by employees who don't want customers to come. This time, they were out of several items on the menu but I wasn't aware until I tried to order them. None of these things are a big deal individually, and it seems all fast food in Charlotte has much worse service than in most places I've lived, but altogether do not get your hopes up for a even mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Ordered two meals, got one of them wrong outright. Didn't give us straws for our drinks. Came home only to find out the tea we ordered was coke. Smh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just left this place, I literally live less than two minutes away and our food was already cold. Not only that I ordered a quesadilla and it barely had anything inside it. I don't know if the night crew is lazy or this Taco Bell just sucks because this is not the first time they gave me crappy food compared to other Taco Bell's."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. Every time I go there they are \"out of\" 4 out of the 5 things I came there to order. Points for my order actually being correct, most other taco bell locations cannot manage even that."}
{"text":"The woman on register is so sweet! Great tone, and awesome up sell!

She was stocking and cleaning. Deff a hard worker. Nicest taco bell employer I've ever encountered. Sadly I did not get her name :(

She was about 5'3, curvy, and maybe light brown hair? I wish I would have asked her name.

Totally made me appreciate the experience!"}
{"text":"After spending 20 minutes in the drive thru on my lunch hour  and still having 8 cars in front of me needless to say I drove off and went elsewhere.  I'm sure it's a staffing problem. Get it together Taco Bell!!"}
{"text":"Went there about 2:40pm on a Monday.
Got trapped in the drive thru line for 17 minutes. There was only 1 car and a motorcycle in front of us. I wish Taco Bell had a different set up so you're not trapped"}
{"text":"I  made an order at the drive-through and by the time I got up to the window I realized that I left my wallet at home because I changed purses and didn't have any money or credit cards to purchase my tacos with. I was really embarrassed and apologized because I couldn't pay for it but the manager was very kind and understanding. He told me to enjoy my tacos, come back again and have a good day.  Wow! Thank you Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I love this Taco Bell! Everyone is nice and accommodating with the mods on my food. 
They have lard free - so vegetarian friendly refried beans that I ask to be substituted instead of the beef in most of the items on the menu. Bam! Bean tacos! Bean crunch wrap supreme! 
They also have breakfast -you can never go wrong with the California AM crunch wrap! 
Rumor is that the cinnamon twists are really rotini noodles but I need to see the receipts! Either way they are too good to not order so treat yo self! 

Keep an eye on the Diamondback's score! (Must get 5 runs & even if they lose) This season alone they have given away* 3 free tacos almost every other day and they have like a million games during the season. So if you like tacos and have $2 jush go**! 




*with purchase of a large drink.
**the day after the game between 4-6pm"}
{"text":"Horrible uncaring service. Which is surprising considering the manager is here. I know the manager is here cuz his laptop and paperwork are taking up one of the good booths. About half of the other tables are dirty. The ice tea machine is broken (and has been for at least 2 weeks) Dr Pepper is out and they say they don't have anymore and the Pepsi is out. It's incredible to me that they stay in business."}
{"text":"Very strange. I pulled into the drive through and was immediately asked how my day was. I politely responded that my day was fine, thanks. As soon as the response left my mouth I was asked to hold. After sitting there for 5 - 10 minutes, the man finally returned to the speaker and asked for my order. I asked for a nacho supreme with jalepenos and a soft taco. Though, it didn't show up on the screen, (which was, in fact, functional). Instead, he blurted it all back to me very quickly and said \"Pull up to the window.\" Didn't give me a total. I really prefer to see my choices on the screen so I could see what I'm paying for the extras. Anyways, no big deal. I pull up. I sit there for about 5 minutes watching employees bustle around but not one comes to run the drive through. Then a man shows up and, finally, gives me my total. I'm almost positive this man is a manager, which is strange. Anyways, I pay for it, get asked what kind of sauce I want on two separate occasions (by the manager and an employee) and I'm still left waiting for quite a while before I get my order. Thinking that with the amount of time they took, there's no way they could have messed it up. And they didn't, on the food. Though they didn't give me.any sauce and nor did they give me my receipt. The food was fine, but the place only had about 3 people inside. They really need to get it together a bit..."}
{"text":"It's a Taco Bell, nothing too special, this location is hit or miss as to how full your burrito will be, and whether or not it will be wrapped well enough to not drip food out the bottom when you take a bite from the top."}
{"text":"I went in today and wanted two gordida supremes and a loco taco.  The cashier was new so someone helped him which was fine.  I told the other employee what I wanted and she told me there was no such thing and there was only a crunch wrap gordida or a regular gordida.  She was very snotty when telling me this.  When leaving the register she tells the new employee if a customer says the name of an item wrong, to try to figure out what they mean.  I thought that was very rude especially when I know there is such an item and that I always order the same thing and have for years.  So when I get my food everything is wrong.  They gave me the crunch wrap.  I talked to the manager and told her I wanted the gordida supreme.  She knew exactly what I was talking about.  I told her as well that her employee was very rude to me and that was uncalled for.  She said she would talk to her employee and ended up giving me free Cinnabon bites.  I have been going to this Taco Bell since I was a kid but I will not be going there ever again."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell, what is there really to say?  I try not to eat fast food, and Taco Bell does offer some healthier options.  I've never received rude or bad service at the drive thru, and this location seems to always be busy, so they must be doing something right.  My orders are always correct and I've enjoyed my food."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this location. Gone here a few times in the morning around the same time. Today I show up at 9:15am pull up to the drive through and the lady tells me sorry we're not open yet. Your store hours say 7am-2Am?? If you can't run the store properly where you can't even be open on time then you need to have corporate take over... Didn't even have a sign as to why there closed."}
{"text":"The food was as expected.

My real problem was the customer service. My girlfriend and I walked in and it was practically dead. There was a girl working drive through but no one was up front to take our orders. We could hear people talking and laughing in the back having a good time. After a few minutes of waiting, more people walked in behind us and also waited. I understand that drive through is its own job so I didn't expect her to help us, but she didn't even bother looking over to check if there were any customers until a few minutes after the people behind us arrived. When she finally realized we were here and waiting, she walked towards us and had a little back and forth with people in the back. She arrived to the register and didn't apologize or even greet us. As we ordered, she muttered something under her breathe about her co workers in the back. We sat and waited for our food until she called our order. I went up to get it and she was gone. We left with no goodbye, have a nice day, or anything of the sort."}
{"text":"Why oh why is it so hard to put cinnamon on your cinnamon twist?!  This is the only Taco Bell I have ever been to where 9 out of ten times the cinnamon twist suck! I'm not being dramatic either ...I mean like one grain of cinnamon on each twist. Why call them cinnamon twist...why not just call them twisty puffs. Ugh. Other than that service is always fast and good."}
{"text":"First off I didn't pay for my food. So they get 4 stars for letting that even happen. However they messed up my order, minus 1 star. Then, after I was done my farts stunk to high heavens and the wife made me sleep on the couch. Minus 1 star. 

Overall: C"}
{"text":"The drive through person flirted with me for two minutes until I finally drove away! They mess up my order every time we go there! And they are rude, unkind, and snobby to us. All we have been is nice! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID TO THEM!!!"}
{"text":"Average staff at best. Love the Mexican Pizza there"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Always happy employees, fast service, and great fast food."}
{"text":"I like going to this location because it's generally really clean and service is super fast and friendly. I take my kids here almost once a week and they love it. I've never had any complaints and the service is always excellent.
I think the best thing they have on the menu right now is the XXL burrito and if I could eat more than one I would!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best Taco Bell in town! It's on my way home so I stop here everyone once in awhile and they always make my order correct and have amazing customer service. Every time I go to another Taco Bell they always mess up my order and are rude but I never have that problem here."}
{"text":"The WORST Taco Bell drive-through. Terrible customer service and long wait times. The food is always cold, and seems like it's been sitting out. The soda is warm and has no carbonation. The employees do not listen, and expect you to repeat your order 5 or more times. Park and go inside. The service inside is much better, and the food actually meets the average Taco Bell quality."}
{"text":"We normally do not experience great guest service at Taco Bell but today we did. The cashier name was Maria G. I was very pleased to have her ring up our order. I will visit this Taco Bell in the near future."}
{"text":"The food was typical Taco Bell food.  The service was a little below typical Taco Bell service but not too bad. The dining room was clean and so were the rest rooms."}
{"text":"This is the typical Taco Bell experience. It was nothing over the top. Good quality is the same and guest service the same. It is in a nice area. That is a plus."}
{"text":"The cashier wasn't that friendly. The service was slow.. The food was standard Taco Bell though."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the worst taco bell I have ever been to. Soft tacos are tiny, service sucks and drive thru always takes forever."}
{"text":"4-15-2017 UPDATE  Family tried again twice at this store.  Ordered the triple double crunch wrap box and the non regular taco was different both times.  Still teeny tiny meat filling in the regular tacos. Out of Pepsi at 11:30 am.  Ordered 3 Quesaritos and they had no meat at all.  The menu is too big, the names too long, and the staff filling the orders don't know which is what.  I have absolutely had it with Taco HELL.

We are usually very happy with this store.  They are polite and fast and the food cheap and good.  But our last visit, the food-yuk!  Ordered a Fiesta Bowl salad.  Short on the stuffing in the bowl and tasted the bowl itself, it had a rancid and bitter taste (perhaps old grease, old shell?) Nasty.  Also ordered 5 regular crispy tacos.  There was LESS than a teaspoon of meat in each shell and very little cheese and no lettuce.  When we first opened them, we thought they had forgotten to fill the shells they were so flat and lacking ingredients.  Shame on you for cheating  your customers."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food is always wrong, management team is extremely rude, I called to complain about a messed up order and one of the managers hung up on me. Totally unacceptable behavior from The employees. I don't know how hard it is to make a Taco correctly or put it in a bag but apparently it's very difficult for the people at this Taco Bell. They have a whole bunch of idiots working there. This time they forgot to bag 6 items, messed up the topping I asked for them to remove. They even forgot or were to lazy to cut my quesadilla. I mean come on people, it's not rocket Science."}
{"text":"How does a manager allow this to happen? Disgusting is all I have to say. Service as ok but omg"}
{"text":"Literally the BEST service here. Like, better than I get at most restaurants. The lady working the drive through is ON IT. She needs a raise."}
{"text":"Granted, Taco Bell isn't going to be a five-star experience, but this one is average even for Taco Bell.  Every time I've gone through the drive-through, they've forgotten something or put in the wrong item.  I stopped using their drive through."}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell, people. Don't go here looking for the best meal you've ever tasted. For what it is, though, the food is decent, and the staff has really improved on remembering to make and bag all ordered items. Not perfect, but like I said, a definite improvement. 

The staff is super perky and positive. They always thank me for choosing Taco Bell, and in return, I always drive off with a smile on my face (and maybe some hot sauce, too...lol)."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is Taco Bell but good lord is the service here terrible!  No such thing as grabbing a quick bite at this location.  Employees standing around being lazy, holding conversations instead or working or waiting on people, orders are wrong half the time,employees arguing over who should work where, drive theough line is slooooow.  Just terrible."}
{"text":"So not only did they mess up our order and give us taco supremes, when you try to call the business all you get is a dial up tone blasting in your ear. Then as we are going through the bag we notice that on top of our order of 3 regular tacos, two chalupas, and a burrito; they gave us someone else's order of an additional 6 tacos... separate bagging receipts included... now I'm stuck with tacos I won't/ can't eat and nobody to speak with to correct this issue!"}
{"text":"The old black lady that works there is really nice but the store smells like an antique store, the seats and tables look super old and their menu looks different from other locations. I ordered a box with one chalupa, a burrito, and the free taco. The beans on the burrito tasted awful and the chalupa and taco didn't have any meat in them. 
This location is just odd and weird. This location lost a customer ."}
{"text":"There had been some issues at this location for awhile, but it seems that they have righted the ship after the remodel that just took place. Occasionally this location can be a little slow, but generally I have no problems.

Keep in mind that most people that are likely to get a job at a Taco Bell these days are mostly unemployable. Those that do show up probably can't do math, so you get what you (don't) pay for.

Stop in here for a quick meal on the way home from work and you shouldn't be too disappointed."}
{"text":"It's fast food, what can you expect? I went inside and got a $5 meal, which is a lot of food for $5. Service was courteous and prompt - I didn't experience any delays mentioned in other reviews. But I did learn that mixing pink lemonade and Baja Blast results in a clear and nearly colorless liquid. So there's that."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's convenient and if you go with a burrito, it's food you can eat while you're driving. There is better nearby if you want Mexican (the 1900 around the corner on Park, for instance) or other sit down food (at the Roasting Company).

I've seen people order $12 worth of higher-end items at a TB, which never makes sense to me. I can completely enjoy (within limits, this isn't Ruth's Chris!) a 7 Layer Burrito or a Spicy Chicken Burrito and walk out of here with change from $5. Add the \"fire\" sauce for a little extra zing.

As TB's go, this one is within standards. Sometimes they fold the burrito properly (sealed at both ends) and sometimes they don't and you have to make sure it doesn't all leak out the bottom.

I have not been given my receipt a couple of times at the drive-thru, though they are pretty good about not screwing up the order."}
{"text":"Easy in, easy out. Taco Bell is probably one of the easiest to eat and drive. As long as you dig into the burrito just right, it's not going to spill all over you while you're piloting a two ton missile down the highway at 115 feet per second.

I pulled into this TB at 1AM and wasn't paying a whole lot of attention. There's apparently a script. She said \"Can you confirm your order on the screen\" and I just kept saying \"No, that's my complete order\" because I was busy checking in on Yelp and not paying attention. I'm sure that she was halfway to calling the cops and reporting a DUI as I drove off with my \"fourth meal.\""}
{"text":"Ordered two items one of which was cinnamon twists. When I got to where I ate them found that they were bland and didn't have any cinnamon on them. I know Taco Bell is cheap and I shouldn't expect much. I called and complained but didn't get satisfaction."}
{"text":"They are always slow. I can be the only person in the store and it takes twenty minutes to get my order. Yesterday I asked for a tostata and they gave me a tostata without any red sauce. I don't have a car so called to complain and asked to have the replaced and delivered to me they said no. They said to come in and they would replace."}
{"text":"Foods aight. But like. I get it isn't this locations fault but somebody has to pay. What's up with them nacho fries? You say you replaced them with the triple melt burrito?! A burrito you already had for a dollar if you remove the Fritos from that dollar one? Psssh. Get out of here. And then on top of that you sub a chalupa for what was supposed to be a cheesy gordita crunch? Bruh like figure your life out. I'd avoid this place like you would a flat earther."}
{"text":"Always go to the drive-through at Taco Bell always have really good food the prices are pretty good love the naked chicken they're absolutely great they should keep it all the time"}
{"text":"We have had consistent issues with the quality of service and food. Time in drive-thru can be long.  Food comes out messy and barely wrapped. We have also had food on more than one occasion that didn't taste fresh or Taco shells that tasted stale. We were craving taco bell tonight and considered going one more time. ..but it's not worth the drive, money or aggrevation."}
{"text":"After the remodel of this taco bell a few years ago, I've seen major improvement. The drive thru usually moves a lot faster than it used to, although there still are some nights where it is backed up. I've also never had my order messed up while going through the drive thru which is a HUGE plus. The inside area is always clean and every time I've eaten inside. Food, although it's not the best, gets the job done when you're  looking for some greasy american mexican comfort food. Workers are always kind and things are running smoothly,"}
{"text":"Worst taco bell I've ever been to. Forced to return because this is the only Taco Bell near me. Ruins my day every time."}
{"text":"This place is the worst for drive thru she literally told us she was on timer for us to hurry we could'nt even look at the menu and there wasnt even any cars behind us!!! No wonder they have no business there's still literally no cars ,we had to come to jack in the boxshe was such a BITCH!!! NEVER AGAIN... I guess their employees dont care to bring business to the company ... I say fire that bitch!"}
{"text":"What in the world has happened to your birrito Supremes? I have never heard of a supreme burrito with no meat loaddd wirh beans sauce and sour cream.  What ever happened to the original recipe?..gross"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the worst Taco Bell I've ever gone to. Don't go here unless you really have to..."}
{"text":"If you read my reviews and check ins then you know how I feel about quality, authentic foods. I live and breathe for them. But, I also live and breathe for Taco Bell. Some fast food just really gets me and TB is no exception.
Stop at this location often before or after seeing a movie.
I'm super sad though that the verde sauce is no longer available. I so liked to drink it. A zesty tomato sauce that was good enough to drink. For real, guys. For real."}
{"text":"Today 5-5-15 Taco Bell offered a free breakfast biscuit taco for Cinco de Mayo! 
I went this morning and scored one of these bad boys (a $2.59 value!).  Not bad, actually much better than it sounds.  Imagine a warm, flaky, buttery biscuit with fake powdered eggs, sausage, and cheese.  The biscuit is flat and then they put the ingredients in a fold it like a taco.
Restaurants that that have special promotions like this but don't tell you something is free is a pet peeve of mine...I expected to drive up to the drive-thru and hear \"Good morning, would you like to try a biscuit taco for free?\" but nope...they wanted to keep it a secret I guess. 
Thanks Taco Bell! It was yummy."}
{"text":"The F***in worst place ever. Worst I've ever been screwed. I shouldn't be surprised because it's EVERY TIME WE'VE BEEN HERE! $16 worth of food and only 4 items, and none of them correct. Steak quesarito, and got a beef, bean, and cheese quesarito I guess? Beyond frustrating.  They need to just get rid of this place and start over."}
{"text":"Have yet to get what I ordered when going through the drive thru. Called back once to tell them how badly it was messed up and got hung up on twice. My fault for not triple checking but you should get what you order and pay for."}
{"text":"Rounded out my Montford night with a trip to Taco Bell. We went through the drive-through and had a great experience. We ordered quickly, confirmed out order on the screen, and got around to the pick-up window where we were greeted by the very friendly drive-through worker. After paying and getting copious amounts of hot sauce, I double checked the items in the back and we were off and headed home. Our tacos were clearly very fresh because they were pretty darn hot in the bag! Whew!

Got home and housed a few tacos - just what we needed at that time. This was a great Taco Bell and I will probably be back next time I am on Montford."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Ill come here again for sure! The employees we easy going and go the extra mile to make you happy!"}
{"text":"Considering the numerous slightly inebriated customers they probably get, they should probably hire cashiers that actually speak English. I can understand needing to fill out a staff and needing to hire people who may not speak English as a first language, but they shouldn't be the ones that actually talk to customers. With that, she did not understand what I was wanting for my order and put beef in it even though I didn't want beef. Another annoying thing is that the line was very unclear, and I didn't know where to go, where I wound up standing behind someone that was waiting for pick-up for a few minutes, and then cut someone that was ordering when I switched lines. On a positive note, at least I received my food fast, and that it is put together correctly and really damn cheap"}
{"text":"I waited in the drive thru for 26 minutes. I would have left but I was trapped. They seem to be very under staffed. The guy working the second was very friendly and was clearly frustrated by the situation as well. Next time I'll just drive to a different location."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Went back for missing food items. Waited 15 mins to be told.. idk how long it will take... there's a long list of food to be made ... then said I can get a refund for the missing items. So waited 20 mins to leave with partial return and no food."}
{"text":"The food was Taco Bell typical.  The service was bad.  They were very short staffed so they would take orders,go make food, the line would build up, they'd go take more orders, etc.....  it took three tries total to get our order correct.  Friendly service but just understaffed and Ill equipped to handle the customers."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Taco Bell. It's nice that they're open late for the college kids and us late night Uber drivers. Lordy, I have figured out a way to veganize taco bell and my hips are not going to be happy! 

I love going into fast food places and seeing the looks on the workers faces when I order things without meat and cheese lol. It's priceless. Anyway, I ordered three tacos with black beans instead of beef and told them to hold the cheese so basically it was a taco with just beans and lettuce...seems pretty boring, right? Nope! Once you squirt Taco Bell's liquid magic a/k/a Fire sauce on these bad boys, they're delicious. I also ordered two bean burritos (yeah, I'm a glutton!) and those came with beans, onions, and red sauce...all vegan and wonderfully delicious. 

The only bad thing about this place is that there's no iced tea thingamabopper in the lobby so you have to ask one of the workers behind the counter to get it for you. They have Lipton Brisk on the fountain but I don't like that syrupy sugary crap. All in all, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The fat girl
Working drive through at night I think she might even be the manager suck. My orders 9 outta 10 times are wrong. Mind you I usually just order a cheese quesadilla I'm
Not sure how exactly you can mess those up. I order chips with cheese sauce & I never get my cheese. I get a lot of items with no sauce. They always forget and mess up my food. That place effing sucks."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if it was an option. Absolutely terrible experience. My kids and I went inside and the dining room was empty. This was at 7pm. Not a good sign. After ordering, we proceeded to sit for over 20 minutes and our order still hadn't arrived. When I finally went to the counter to inquire about our food, I was told the order had been \"lost. \" Again,  empty dining room and employees standing around chatting in the back. I should also mention the napkin dispenser was empty and no paper towels in the men's room (employees apparently don't wash their hands ). 
I asked for my money back and we left, never to return. There is a Del Taco 2 miles down the street. Much better option! This Taco Bell needs a management overhaul!"}
{"text":"I was tickled at how polite the drive-through cashier was. She was very nice and friendly said thank you have a nice day come back and see us again and all with a smile and did not sound fake phony or forced. They had one of the best ratings that I've ever seen for a Taco Bell or any other fast food restaurant for that matter."}
{"text":"We ran through their driveway yesterday after church. Our order was wonderful... But my mom's meal was missing one of the main ingredients. That was remedied by packets of sauce that they gave us through the window.
I've been to this particular location because it's closest to my home and I've been there several times. They are always very courteous and seem to be genuinely friendly... Not put on.
I'm a little bit of germsphobic so I'm always keeping an eye out for restaurant ratings,  and these guys had a great one. A lot of people don't realize that it's very hard to get 100% in a restaurant rating. They generally don't give that Hi of a grade and usually knock off two points to start. This particular location had a great  sanitation rating which I will post a picture of. 

They were very kind and gave my mother a senior citizen drink for free."}
{"text":"Best place to go after you eat at TK Sushi. Well that is because the wife and I would not wait the extra 45 min to get a 2nd roll each.
This Bell is nice. Claen and the staff top notch. The Thank yous and welcomes from walking in to leaving are a very nice touch."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month, around 7ish. The drive thru takes at least 10 minutes! Horrible drive thru!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always had a decent experience at this Taco Bell. Though, this isn't my most frequented Taco Bell, just because of its proximity to my home.

I am a huge fan of the breakfast menu. I love the California Crunchwrap. No, it's not fresh avocado, but it's Taco Bell, what do you expect? I love the hash brown inside the crunchwrap.

I don't really try new things at places, so that's all I got. Service was decently quick when we went inside to order."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell has constantly let me down.
The only thing fast is them taking your money and you still have to wait in line.
They have more then once dropped my order and I had to ask for the manager to get my food.
Maybe if they would stay off there cellphones and pay attention to what needs to be done service might just improve."}
{"text":"12 min wait in the drive thru. When I finally got to the window all the employees were hanging out drinking soda. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"I don't like Taco Bell very much nor come to Taco Bell often.  I get constantly reminded why I don't eat here thirty minutes after I finish my food at ANY Taco Bell.

This one.  This Taco Bell is a pure gem.  I'm not giving this place FIVE STARS because of the food, I'm giving this FIVE STARS because it gets wild here! 

If you like to people-watch college students in Tempe, you need to come here!  The staff are incredibly helpful and are patient, even under the hectic circumstances.  This place deserves a good rating."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of the Wild Naked Chalupa! Wow, what a sexy little thing to eat! The commercials were non stop on this one tv station I was watching, and they made me drive there and get one!

Thanks Taco Bell Commercial People!

Drive thru was easy peasy, nice customer service and the Chalupa was still hot after I returned home.

Honestly, I've never really been a fan of Taco Bell, but that Chalupa changed my mind. I don't know if that's good or bad, because now I'll crave it! Darn it!!!!

Go get you one, I know you want one too!"}
{"text":"Pretty brutal, just went through drive thru window and wound up leaving with part of my order missing (I discovered once already home). I called the main number which was answered after the twentieth ring simply \"hello \". After confirming it was a Taco Bell a young man said hold on for the manager . Then, another young voice entered into earshot and said \"man hang up! Why did you answer ?\". The phone was promptly hung up without comment. Then it rang over and over for no answer still...

Went in today for my replacement order after I called again the next day and was told to come by, that they had my name on a list to fix my order. After ordering the man at the window stepped aside to let a 50 ish Woman chastise me for not having a receipt . When I called earlier the man I spoke with took my name , order number and said to give my name at the window. No receipt was asked for other than my order number. 
She actual told me \"she would give me the FREE food , but not to come here again expecting it\". I explained to her a male manager on Saturday had told me to come in, and she responded they didn't have any men at that location. It went downhill from there. It isn't free food by the way if you pay for it and they don't put it in the bag. 
Here's a picture of customer service criminal I talked to tonight. 

I showed her all the calls on my phone and she still was nasty ."}
{"text":"if i could give a  negative star review i would! we can't in the morning with a big order and it took them 15 minutes just to come to the drive thru window to get our money once we finally got our food the food was cold and not right. when i called to tell them the food was wrong and cold they told me they would replace it and to come back in with my reciept when it was convienent so we came back 5 days later when we came back into town and then they told us it was to late to come back for the food we needed to do it before 5 days i told them it was 5 days and the manager i spoke to never said a time frame. so they finally agreed to replace my order and then told me next time i need to come back within 3 days. this taco bell lacks customer service skills and any sort of speed. if your order is larger then one or two things expect to sit there waiting for at least 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is old school but I love it. They were quick with the food and there is great little seating area in front. Drive through takes a while."}
{"text":"This was the worst Taco Bell experience of my life.  The crunchy taco was soggy, the soft taco was crunchy, the food was cold and OLD.

Thoroughly disgusting."}
{"text":"I ordered the $5.00 steak nacho meal. Had barely any steak on it. Chips were stale, service was good. But not going to stop here again"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would . This place sucks ! So hours of operations was 530-2am ! At the drive thru at 140am and no one we pull up to the window there's a worker inside gestured with her hand basically saying no there closed. Really so there getting paid to do nothing just stand around and talk and refuse customers. I hope someone high up sees this post !"}
{"text":"At least once a year I get a craving for Taco Bell... I know, gross right? And so bad for you too! I ordered the crunch wrap supreme once and it was so soggy and didn't taste like anything. Very bland. The last time I remember going there I got hard tacos and again absolutely no flavour.  Had to use hot sauce packets and even then it just tasted like their hot sauce. Serves me right for going there I guess lol"}
{"text":"After a challenging day of taking a sick baby to the doctor, barely getting my 3-year-old to preschool on time, reiki class, getting him picked up, and now jetting him to occupational therapy, I had not eaten all day. With no time to get out of the car, and just enough to speed through a drive-thru, I was desperate so I went through at this Taco Bell. I only eat meat twice per week and I do not eat red meat at all really. I ordered a grilled stuffed chicken burrito with no cheese and no refried beans (trying to keep it as healthy as possible). You can imagine my disappointment when I bit into it and found steak instead of chicken inside. :\"( They had even confirmed with me that my order was correct on the screen. I can't be late to my son's therapy. I have no time to go back. I am still hungry. Bummer. Shame on you Taco Bell. :-( :-( :-("}
{"text":"The service provided by this location has improved so much from previous years. Also the food is great. Better than most Taco Bell locations. 
Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Great customer service this morning.  The young man at the counter was quite pleasant.  Food is fresh and good."}
{"text":"When you ask for no lettuce in your taco and you know he understood you because the receipt says so but the taco maker failed to notice on his screen. Not cool man. I was counting on you to deliver what I ordered a simple order test you failed. Story of Taco Bell at times. 

Place is clean. Staff friendly. Orders right most of the time. That's all I have."}
{"text":"waited 30 whole minutes in drive through line tonight, left Glaziers across the street drive over to taco bell, figured 5 mins in n out grab a quick bite for the ride home. 6 cars ahead of me, no big deal 2 mins a car you'd assume, nope not tonight, 5 minutes per car so do the math 30 minutes not cool. would have drove off if I was not blocked in on either end by other poor saps waiting in the same line as me. On the brighter side kid at the window was polite and offered me free cinnamon twists, that makes it all worth it yippee..... food was typical, I think the highlight was the frozen drink."}
{"text":"Really waiting in drive thru with five cars in front of me for 20 minutes.   Sorry I'm backing up and going somewhere else"}
{"text":"I come to this Taco Bell pretty frequently as I live pretty close.  Came in tonight a couple minutes before posting this, and I just had to leave a 5 star review.  They're always so fast, and I appreciate that but the real reason is for the drive thru girl Juliette.  Seriously some of the best customer service I've had.  Give her a raise!  Thanks again, T Bell I'll stop back in soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and happy they are finally keeping the bums from using the soda fountain with their dirty cups!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Taco Bell location something is either missing overcooked under cooked... better be careful Del taco is gonna put you under... you need to step up your game at this location! The speed was way faster but I see why when the food was half there..."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is usually my \"go to\" for fast food. It isn't great food, but for what I pay, I'm very satisfied with what I get. Service at this location has always been friendly and I receive my order quickly."}
{"text":"Their new syracha chicken wasn't good at all and also the chicken quesadilla, seems like the recipe was changed!!! Make it original or I'll NEVER eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"Eat here whenever I crave a good chalupa. 

Staff is very good. I have been here a lot and I never had an order wrong. Food is fresh and drive through is very fast. 

I have met a lot of great people driving up to the window. Very friendly and personable. But not the type to talk your ear off."}
{"text":"Restaurant review:
There are so many mexican restaurants/fast food places to visit around the UIUC campus. I stopped by here on the weekend for lunch after work and was surprised there was no line. The cashier was quick to take my order after I figured out what I wanted and the food came out as I ordered without any issue. This is what pulls up the rating to 3 stars as the food has sharply declined from taco bell and is now a lot more expensive. Crunchy tacos are no longer 0.79 cents but 1.29 now. A lot of the other items have doritos, fritos, etc which is interesting, but it does not carry over to tasting good. All and all as fast food I think I will pass from eating at Taco bell now with the higher prices and subpar food items. The parking lot is also very small which is another issue. 

Pro: Large selection of fast mexican food, quick service, friendly cashiers

Cons: Subpar food, very small parking lot

Hidden gem:
Happier hour 2 - 5 PM 1 dollar regular freeze or medium drink. Value menu, although a lot of items are no longer one dollar."}
{"text":"Went to this T-bell tonight by my friends place, and I pull up at 1:45am thinking I'm the biggest jerk pulling in right before they close and I see another car in the drive thru! I'm thinking the staff probably isn't happy to see us, but I pull up to the menu to order, and this guy over the mic is so happy, and so enthusiastic I immediately feel at ease and excited for this delicious food. When I pull up to the window (the guy's name is Jammin!), he was even more amazing in person! This guy literally deserves a raise and a promotion because you can tell he has passion for whatever he does, and he was phenomenal. This Taco Bell is across town for me, but I'd definitely come here over any other just because of Jammin. He gave the best customer service I've had in years, literally. Such a sweet guy."}
{"text":"There was a loooooong line at the drive thru so we parked and went inside, only to find a completely empty restaurant. No wait, all the tables were clean, and we got the food fast. 
Very cool custom artwork adorns the walls. There's a variety of booths, low tables, and high tops to choose from. Check it out."}
{"text":"Yo NO QUIERO THIS Taco Bell!!!! AVOID THIS PLACE!!! Just ordered a bunch of food at drive through including 3 taco Supreme meals.  It's 10:30 on a Friday night, got them home by 10:40 PM. EVERY TACO IS BROKEN AT THE BOTTOM AND THE MEAT IS BURNED!!! On top of all the taco shells are soggy even at the top side. I want my money back this is shameful. I'm done being ripped off, I will take this to corporate."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure is Taco Bell. I'm not sure why because my body hates me after. When I'm feeling like sitting on the pot for an hour, I eat here."}
{"text":"Ok ya so I'm reviewing a freaking Taco Bell...

But I am impressed. They are the nicest folk here. Can be slow when it's a large crowd but the short lady (I am tall) and I have a running joke about our heights. 

End story: this ain't your typical don't give a crap tb. This is a great place!"}
{"text":"I don't normally get Taco Bell and look forward to when i get to enjoy it. Sadly there was little enjoyment to this visit. The wait was nearly ridiculous, the taco shells were stale. They couldn't even get the sauces that they asked twice about correct. It's almost like they do it on purpose. I'm not usually in Southern Illinois, if you are I  would avoid this place. The cleanliness may be questionable also."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell is usually really good besides how long it takes to get food but tonight was not good at all when I got my tacos they were soggy and cold and I didn't open them for like 20 mins which should never have happened in that time period!"}
{"text":"Giving one star, only because you can't give zero. All this location is missing is a huge sign on the front door that says \"Enter at your own risk!\" 

Upon walking in, the first thing I noticed was an extremely foul aroma. Nature was calling, so I beelined it to the bathroom. Right outside the restroom doors, a women's hygiene product lay on the ground. It was open, but was it used? I dare not ask. The men's restroom was the source of the smell, but what it was coming from eluded me. I took care of business, and opted not to wash my hands afterward, fearing I would be far worse off by touching anything! 

When I got out of the restroom, and approached the counter (I wasn't going to order, I just wanted to see behind the counter) I saw the shift manager go right from washing dishes, to pulling a pizza out of the oven without washing his hands! There was food all over the floor, trash in the floor drains, and a sopping wet mop leaning against the oven. 

Needless to say, and decided against dinner tonight. The smell alone had consumed my appetite."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite, idk if it's healthier than any other fast food places. I love the simple bean burrito with green sauce no onions add sour cream and extra cheese is my favorite. and don't for get the hot sauce."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I am a fairly healthy person. I only come here on occasion 2 get some tacos or burritos for business gatherings. I always park in the parking lot and walk inside every single time I do the drive-thru get ten times more attention than people that walk in. I would think that if I was so lazy I had to wait in line to order my burrito while sitting in my car I should get second priority over the people that decide to park and walk inside."}
{"text":"This location always gets my order wrong. I usually get the Power Veggie Burrito fresco. Today I got the burrito- no fresco and refried beans. Plus they forgot the cinnamon twists. And there was no one there. I definitely won't be back. I rarely have a problem with Taco Bell too. Don't come here if you want your order correct."}
{"text":"I mean it's Taco Bell, it's not a 5 star restaurant...but I would go against the majority of reviews on this location. 

The service was quick and friendly, my order was correct and the food was exactly what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I know 5 stars for taco bell. What am I thinking right? Seriously though, this taco bell makes me smile every time I go through their drive through. 

Who would have thought that I would take the time to review a Taco Bell, but this place I had to. It's just that good. 

What's so good about it? The service, the service and the service. Yes 3 times. It's just that good. 

The food is what you'd expect, but the service is just out of this world. Did I mention their service? Yes. That good. So good that I had to take some time and write about it and tell everyone. 

You'll get a friendly person taking your order and a smile when you receive your food with a warm friendly good bye. Wow. I was not expecting this from a fast food joint. Let alone Taco Bell. Kudos to the management and the training. You guys are doing a stellar job. Don't stop. 

Thumbs up for their friendly service and their crunch wrap supreme. You guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Went in on National Taco Day (Oct. 4). Nice decor. Clean. Friendly. We ordered three taco boxes, (12 tacos), available only today. We did wait awhile. A few others customers were there also. Dinner was quite good. I don't know if the shop is regularly slow, or just busy."}
{"text":"I know, I know, it's Taco Bell.  But I had to give props to the new one on the block because, after my girlfriend craving it for days finally went over there.  We decided to go in and I'm so glad we did.  This one is designed really nicely!  The walls are painted in bright but not annoying colors.  There are booths, tables and bar top tables spaced out enough that even if it was full no one would feel on top of each other.  And the people didn't even looked upset to be working there.  (You know how some folks get that look?)  I know it's only a few months old, but it was super clean - even the bathrooms!  

And the food?  It was actually good.  Well, good for Taco bell.  Everything was hot and had the right amount of sauce that it should have had.  They forgot the green onions on a Mexican pizza, but beyond that it was all just as you'd want it to be.  

If you're ever fast food searching in the area, know that this should be a safe spot for you.  And sometimes, isn't it just a relief to know which ones won't screw up your order?"}
{"text":"Do we really need this in our lives?  Really?  REALLY????

This is the second such place I've seen - the first was over a year ago and I'd almost forgotten but I think it's over on 7th street near Dunlap.  They just closed down the Taco Bell on Central and built this here.   But really???  

Sigh... what's sad is how it makes my family happy.  I could (but don't anymore) eat Taco Bell 3-4 times a week easily and never feel like it was too much.  Girlfriend feels close to the same for Long John Silvers, especially the hush puppies, but there's never been one near our house.  Until now.  And where did they put this?  On our path between home and the gym.  Grrr.....

So we relented after a long night and figured we'd get it over with. I can't get over the smell when you walk in.  Funky.  But the interior is done nicely with lots of booths and low tables.  Best part is a large round table that can easily sit 6.  They are kinda going for a seaside Mexican seafood look.  It doesn't work so well, but it's certainly not bad.  My tacos were yummy.  She said her fish was a little greasy.  (Don't even know how she can tell.  But apparently she can.)

It's not important cuisine by any means, but it's not the worst fast food in the area.  But again, did we really need this?"}
{"text":"I have only been to this Taco Bell about 3-4 times since I live 35 miles north of it. Each time has been through the drive thru but I have always had a positive experience! I'd say this is one of the best Taco Bell's you'll visit in Wisconsin. 

Staff: 5 out of 5 - The drive thru people have always been outgoing and enthusiastic. They are always great to talk to and they seem to be really enjoy what they were doing. Also very speedy. 

Cleanliness: I've only actually seen the outside but I didn't see any trash at all in the parking lot or the drive thru. Overall a very good looking outside of the building. 

Food: The food was HOT and FRESH. You know the Taco Bell is great when the food is outstanding. That's the most important part. I felt like I've always received very well made food that's always made fresh. 

I highly recommend making a stop at this Taco Bell if you're looking for food in the area. This kind of service is what makes Taco Bell's great."}
{"text":"I have tried to give this place a number of chances after consistently waiting an inordinate amount of time each time I go. Just went again two days ago and waited at least 10 minutes, after finally getting to the window, and after all of that, they forgot my drinks. Had to wait another five minutes until they took two more orders from other drive-thru customers to finally get my drinks. It's a shame because the location is very convenient, but their service is extraordinarily slow for \"fast food\". The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the food is good."}
{"text":"Very tired of \"pull forward\" so that they can trip there drive thru timer. 0 stars.............................."}
{"text":"Avoid this location like the plague. I've gone here twice, and both times were awful. The most recent time, I waited in their drive through line for 15 minutes, just to get home and realize they gave me someone else's order. This place is ridiculous and I'm never going back...I would advise you to do the same."}
{"text":"This is THE WORST fast food place EVER in the world. If you could find ANYTHING worse, I'd be suprised. I always go back to give chance after chance after chance. Just waited in the drive thru for 20 min, at the order board and didn't even get a \"please give us a min\" nothing! This always happens. I don't know how this buisness succeeds. I've worked in the service before, so I get how it goes sometimes.. but this place should be shut down. I don't know why it's called fast food, there isn't a thing fast about it all."}

I called to complain Victoria the manager said what would you like me to do. I replied with het the order right the first time. She instructed that I write her name on the receipt and she would comp the next time I come in.  Which I won't be back to this one!!!! It's not that hard to make food!!!! Learn some customer service"}

You would be better off getting a sandwich from 711. I love Taco Bell but the wait at night at this location is just ridiculous.."}
{"text":"Closed at 10:05 and they say they're open until11. Called twice and they picked up and hung up on me. No wonder they have awful reviews. Saw a chick standing in the drive thru but all of the lights were off on the drive thru menu. Calling their owner and corporate so they can look into it."}
{"text":"**AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!**

I'm a longtime customer - i'd previously given them a good review, this used to be such a wonderful place...NOT ANYMORE.  It's become completely ruined by the worst-possible management.

I had quite a few horrible experiences and spoke up about them; all i wanted was an apology and reimbursement or some kind of compensation for money i was ripped off of.  Not only did the owner of this store absolutely refuse to provide either or offer any type of assistance at all, but he actually turned around, falsified his report to the corporate offices that he did indeed help me and resolved/closed the matter (he did NADA) but then even actually went so far as to then THREATEN ME with an all-out lie!  

This store is owned by a vindictive bully who will punish anyone who speaks up about any problems encountered at his store.  If you eat here, you'll be sorry!  I refuse to patronize a business that engages in victim-blaming/shaming, deception, dishonesty, and trickery.  As all Yelpers should know, a business should NEVER engage in any kind of retaliation for customers who speak up about lousy experiences and the owner of this place's sole definition of \"customer resolution\" is intimidating people who dare offer any kind of negative feedback into silence.  Because of this Taco Bell is now on my boycott list - not just this one, but all locations.  People like him should not be allowed to get away with the shady abusive stuff he does.

I hate to say this too because there are actually lots of good friendly employees who work there and i feel sorry that they have to work for such a mobster...er uh...monster.  But for every really wonderful employee there's several who continually mess things up, pay no attention to detail and are obviously miserable being there (but in their defense, with an owner like that, can you blame them?)  There's also been numerous occasions where there's been a drunk person and/or beggar going around bothering both the people in line and those sitting down to eat...and one such person appeared to be a friend of one of the workers and thus no one was doing anything about them.

This was once one of the best Taco Bell's in the valley and it's pretty heartbreaking to see what it's now become.  Maybe some day in the future, the ownership will change from its current corruption and someone who actually cares about customers will be in place.  (If this happens, could someone let me know?  I might end my boycott then.)  But for now, if you must eat at Taco Bell, whatever you do, don't ever go to this one...they put the \"H\" in Taco Hell."}
{"text":"It's only 8:00pm and your out of empanadas for the night? So much for Open Late!  And what's with the folding chairs taking up space in the parking lot? I didn't know you had opened a used car lot too! Geeze - not the best service!!"}
{"text":"Hunter is the man. He might quite possibly be the happiest and most joyous person on this planet. Well, at least in Las Vegas. I thought I was talking to a scripted, overly happy and excited, prerecording when I pulled up to the drive through. Low and behold, it's this guy who just loves people. He even asked about my car and created small talk during the 20 seconds it took to get my order handed to me. Promote this guy and give him a raise quickly or he will get recruited and job offered before you know it!  If it's due to a high level of training and expectations set, then keep doing what you do! (But still promote this guy) Great job Hunter! Keep putting smiles on people's faces. Sometimes you may be the only reason that someone has a better day. This experience impacted mine enough to make me spend time on here to say thank you."}
{"text":"I get it that fast food, is literally fast food. However I was very disappointed with my visit. I was the only person in the drive thru and it took them 10 minutes to give me my food. To top it off I live 2 min away and when I got home the taco shells were soggy and the Mexican pizza was soggy too. Felt as if the food they gave me was just sitting there for awhile and they just gave it to me. Did I mention I got food poisoning right after? Yeah never going back again."}
{"text":"We avoid this location as a rule, frequently traveling 15 minutes out of the way because we know that any other location in the valley can make up the difference just by serving at their normal rate. They seem clueless and lackadaisical and rarely even mention the obvious lengthy delay that is included with every visit. 

It absolutely boggles my mind that these reviews continue to mount and nothing changes. There have been no responses from the company nor the management. Something needs to give, but sadly for us, sometimes it's the only TB option on short notice. I guess it's time to yelp corporate. 

What a bad example they set.

-Frustrated"}
{"text":"There is very little to complain about regarding this Taco Bell. It is what it is: Taco Bell. Prices are right where they should be, employees seem trained, apparently motivated, reasonably proficient. Once in a while something silly happens like my total comes to $4.95 and I hand the cashier a ten dollar bill and get back $4.95 in change.

Big on politeness and giving receipts! A predictably good Taco Bell experience most every time."}
{"text":"My food was not as fast at this location as I have experienced in other locations.  However, it was pretty popular here around 2pm.  When I walked around, a lot of the tables were dirty with left over pieces of food that I ended up sitting on stools. The food was still good, but I prefer other locations.

Menu Items I like:  Soft Taco Supreme and Cinnamon Twists"}
{"text":"They are very friendly at the drive through and when I asked if I could cover my bean burrito w cheese, they said yes! Prices are cheap and food always comes out hot and  the same.  I always get the bean burrito (89 cents), beefy  5 layer (1.49) , or soft taco (99 cents).  I give it a 4 because if price for food, quick, and the quality never changes.

I do not recommend eating inside. It's a tiny place and looks like it hasn't been renovated in a long time. I feel cramped in there."}
{"text":"Best taco Bell in town, the costumer service is always on point. I love this location, I've coming here for a while now and love the friendliness of the staff, the drive through sometimes might be a little busy but it always moves fast, they sure make the food quick."}
{"text":"Personally Taco Bell is probably my favorite fast food place! And I've never been to one this so fast before! Like damn! There was 4 people in front of me, and I was like okay I kinda figured I would be there for a minute, and next thing I know I have my food! It was like, a two minute wait tops! And that's including ordering! I am so impressed with this franchise right here!"}
{"text":"Tastes like Taco Bell and the drive thru wait is better than average!"}
{"text":"The new Doritos Ranch Taco is pretty delicious!  

Taco Bell in Steelyard has never done me wrong.  

It's Tacobelllicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 beefy Fritos burritos and it literally took them like 10 minutes for them to call my name. Either everyone is slow af or they don't care about speed. This sorta thing wouldn't of happened in the drive thru. Other than that, the burritos we delicious since they were freshly made."}
{"text":"Piece of shit Taco Bell. I've been to many other Taco Bell's in Las Vegas and this is by far the worst one. I went the late at night, and the manager told me to wait a min. 5 mins later they finally take my order. After paying I ask for hot sauce and the guy gives me 3 packets, for 8 burritos. Imma stick to the Taco Bell on Nellis and DI. You guys need to stop hiring ratchet ass people."}
{"text":"Manager working today, girl named Tony (July 12 @ 130pm) is SO LOUD yelling in the kitchen...which unfortunately is basically IN the dining area. Sounds like I'm on kitchen nightmares with Gordon Ramsey. She's belittling her co-workers and barking out orders. She's also singing really annoying songs as well.  Can't stand it.  What an unpleasant experience to eat here. I am SO glad I don't work with this lady. Now that would suck. :)"}

13752 W. Waddell Road, Surprise, AZ 85379

My husband and I stopped at this Taco Bell location last night 2/17/15 for dinner.  We ordered 2 chicken burritos and 2 Doritos Supreme Fire Tacos.  The burritos hardly have any chicken in it, mostly lettuce and sour cream and a few very small little pieces of chicken in it. 
My husband became violently ill this morning for eating food here at this location, he hadn't throw up in his last 26 years but he woke up in the middle of the night threw up follow with diarrhea after eating here at this Taco Bell location.  He felt extremely weak almost dying after laying awake last night to make multiple trips to the bathroom on toilet and throwing up!  
I was observing employees at this location last night while waiting for our food, they wore gloves in preparing food but they touch other dirty things then they went right back in preparing food again without changing gloves.  I thought .... I was hoping my food wasn't prepared by that person who I happened to witness doing that while I was waiting.  
We will never come here at this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Another trip to Nellis AFB, followed by another lunch at this Taco Bell.  Again, a satisfying Crunchy Taco Supreme with fresh and cold tomato pieces and Mild Hot Sauce followed by a Burrito Supreme that was a nice contrast of warm refritos and ground beef melding well with cold sour cream.  Quick and friendly service.

This time, not arriving famished, I ordered and ate reasonably.  Again, XXX-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service even by fast food standards. Drive thru advertised as open til 1 am. Arrived at 1250 to order the bacon club chalupa. Was advised they could not make that item any longer that night because \"the fryers have already been cleaned and drained for the night\" unacceptable to start closing things early before the restaurant drive thru closes. The employee on duty, Mark, thought this was completely acceptable to close the fryers before the restaurant had closed. Plan to reach out to this locations GM as well as corporate."}
{"text":"For some reason it seems so random to rate a fast food restaurant, but this place really deserves a good review. The reason I wanted to take the time to give them a review is that no single employee there deserved high praise ... they all do! I mean usually you go to a place and there's that one great employee, a bunch of mediocre ones, and the other folks. But not here. They all seem enthusiastic and genuinely friendly, even willing to joke with you when they're not busy. It's like going to an \"actual restaurant\" instead of a fast food place."}
{"text":"I normally don't review fast food stuff. However when the service is poor enough I will... I gave if 2 stars because let's face it you know what you're getting when you come here, in these type restraints the rating is always about service.  The service here charger ed me the wrong amount, corrected it with out an apology and then served me the wrong order again with out apology.  So hello 2 stars!"}
{"text":"The workers are slow and rude! I waited 16min for 2 grillers and they gave me 2 soft tacos. They also told my friend that maybe next time he should try speaking up instead of mumbling or talking to himself."}
{"text":"Y'know... For a taco bell it ain't that bad! I always enjoy myself and I love how you can get free refills of pop. Num Num Num. It's cheap -- I always get the value meal with one hard and one soft taco and fries with a drink all under 5 dollars! Not too shabby. 

I only come here when I really want to be bad though.."}

{"text":"Staff and food are pretty good...for a Taco Bell, but if you go through the drive through, double check all your food is in your bag before you leave the window!"}
{"text":"Last time I came I didn't get my cinnamon delights after I paid for them. A few days later I came back and they said there was nothing they could do. Alright I understand that, but let me tell you what pushed me over the edge! There freeze machine was down....again."}
{"text":"Friendly greeting but really gross condiment stations. No \"sporks\"? Hmmm. My enchirito was great; really cheesy, good amount of sauce. My soft taco supreme was filled with meat and vegetables; very filling. Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"First time here, probably my last. Worst. Taco. Bell. Ever. Enchiritos & smothered bruit to had no sauce, waited over 20 min in drive-thru, tacos were just thrown together. 

However, when I brought it back the shift manager was very apologetic and remade everything on the spot. A possible save...

Just ate the food they replaced. Horrible. All of it was lukewarm. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We go to this location on a regular basis because it is nearby my house. Normally I would give them three stars because they do a decent job. Today I had a horrible experience, therefore the one star. I ordered two of the one dollar stackers. They were horrible; the tortillas were chewy and dry and I was unable to eat the food.

I went back a couple hours later to ask them to replace it with a couple of tacos. The person at the drive-thru asked the manager in the manager replied \"no\". After arguing with the girl for a couple of minutes she asked me if I had my receipt, to which I replied \"no, you never gave me one.\" The person at the drive-thru was the same girl that helped me a couple hours prior. As a matter fact I gave her a $50 bill and she was unable to give me correct change. I asked her if she remembered me and the $50 bill and she looked at me like a deer in headlights. 

At that point I was beyond pissed. They were arguing over two dollars in food, and that's not even their food cost, that is what I paid for it. Finally a girl named Sherry came over and couldn't believe they were arguing with me over two tacos. She was wonderful... She replaced my inedible stackers with two tacos.

I just cannot believe this is how they service their customers."}
{"text":"Painful. Need I say more? 
It's a chain, but despite that they still manage to butcher food so badly that it leaves your guts begging for mercy and wishing you hadn't tortured yourself."}
{"text":"Normally, I get good service in here and friendly people. Tonight the girl at the drive-through screwed up the salad I ordered ask for dressing on the side. When I tried to get her to fix it she wanted to know what was the purpose of the dressing on the side when it comes with dressing., Some people are dieting and maybe they don't want somebody else pouring a big glob of dressing on their salad. anyway A little disappointed with the service tonight."}
{"text":"Food is good.

Slowest service. Ever. For a taco bell/LJS.  I've come to expect this, so I don't go there if I am ever in a hurry.

Plan to wait a good amount of time in the drive thru. One time I waited 20 minutes, with only 2 cars ahead of me."}
{"text":"Drive thru was pretty good. They didn't know what I wanted when I said the quesadilla wrapped burrito. They only knew it by Quesarito.  It was good. Quite filling. It was $3.79 which is pricier than regular burritos and tacos, but it was a delicious combination."}
{"text":"We wated in the drive thru for 20 min and once we finally got are food we found out that we didn't get what we ordered and we were still charged for it so I would recommend not eating here if I could give it co-stars I would"}
{"text":"I went thru the drive thru. The voice on the speaker was a male, he had a very clear, understandable voice. He made sure my order was correct on the board (screen) before I pulled off. Came to the window to pay and saw Christopher, who took my order. He was very polite, asked if I needed hot sauce, I asked for \"mild\", he asked, medium mild or medium hot, I said medium hot. Like finally someone cares about \"my needs\" at a fast food drive thru...I'm happy!!! Thank you Christopher for a great experience at a fast food place, I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Obese guy wearing a king's crown at the counter.  What the heck?  Drive thu was the slowest I've seen in my entire life, and I was given a disingenuous apology from the staff who noted that an employee \"just walked out\".  No attempt to make it right, no free food, no discounted order, nothing.  This is place is hard to beat.  Interior is very dirty too."}
{"text":"Newer, cleaner Taco Bell than most.  Decent parking too, and not exactly a lot of riff-raff customers like many Taco Bells.  Easy to see on the south/west side of the road."}
{"text":"Worst service of a Taco Bell. They told us the place was closed 10 minutes before it was closing. Then as going through the drive thru we see people inside. Couldn't take multiple orders. These people suck"}
{"text":"I sadly regret wasting time and money at this Taco Bell.  
I went today May 2, 2017 @ about 7:50 pm. I ordered a 7 layer burrito with no rice. They forgot to put cheese in it. They only put 10 little pieces of lettuce, 9 pieces of chopped tomatoes. I am extremely disappointed. A definition of \"a layer\" needs to be explained. I have been ordering the 7 layer burrito for about a decade. Today's 7 layer burrito was the smallest one I have ever had. 
We also ordered a taco-burrito and 2 burritos for the kids. I wanted to call them but their contact information is not updated on yelp.

How can I give them half a star? They are brave opening up in the hood. At this location they forget that loyal customers don't come to incompetent businesses."}
{"text":"Sitting in the drive through now for 30 min. Because the person in front of us ordered a shot ton of items. It's a drive through for a reason. Anyone ordering an insane amount the required more than a 10min wait should be advised to go inside or pull around to the front. We weren't made aware that the two cars in front had massive 15+ orders EACH. This is NOT customer service. Peoples enter the drive through normally because they're in a rush. Normally because they don't have the TIME to go inside and or wait a ridiculous amount of time. We were not told sorry we were never warned of the wait time and all we had was one cravings box and a beefy 5 layer. TO WAIT NOW 35 min FOR 2 items that normally takes less than 8min IS RIDICULOUSLY BAD PRIORITIZATION on managements part. McDonalds doesn't even do this. They have the cars pull frw. That's right.... the wait was so long and made us so frustrated that this is now ranked BELOW MCDONALDS.  And no pulling away wasn't an opt when the drive through has 6-7 cars in line behind us and 2 in front. You're a FAST food chain. At least get the FAST part down."}
{"text":"This Taco Bell sucks!  Poorly run.  I don't get fountain drinks here anymore because the sodas have a taste of windex or some other cleaning agent (about three times now).  Don't dare order nachos here either.  They're so damn skimpy on the cheese and toppings...75% of your \"nachos\" will be just dry tortilla chips.  On multiple occasions going through the drive-thru I've had to park and go inside to have them correct it.  I know these are entry-level jobs but I could never in good conscience short change customers with food the way they do so consistently.  It must be a training thing.  Only reason they're still in business is because their prime location.  Avoid going here if you can."}
{"text":"Got there at 11:45 am. Apparently they only care about the drive thru. I went in and no one came to the counter it even acknowledged me. I waited two minutes and left.
I guess only the drive thru matters."}
{"text":"Not the smartest bunch of people working here. Check your bag before you head home because I can almost guarantee they forgot something. Always claim they run out of products so they don't have to make them because they're lazy. Most of them don't wear gloves when handling food or touch everything with the gloves on, which defeats the purpose of said gloves. I only come here because it's convenient when I need my beefy nacho burrito fix."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Waited in line for about 5 minutes before the manager Yaneth came out. She spoke to a former employee while I stood there. She glanced at me twice but said nothing. Finally, Gio - another employee, came to take my order. I had looked at him a few times as well while he looked away, so I was surprised he was finally taking my order. When I mentioned the lack of professionalism, Yaneth started to argue with me about how she thought I was with the former employee. I clearly was standing no where near him. Never once apologized. Just an attitude of here your food, now get out. Disappointing! If customer service is not something you're good at, then maybe you shouldn't be in that industry."}
{"text":"Best drive thru for the sake of the guy who uses a great voice that makes you smile when ordering your food. Overall speed, not too bad. But you gotta order from this unmistakable drive thru guy. Awesome!"}
{"text":"So I go in to get my order and I missing 3 cinnamon twist off my order not that big of a deal... I cannot get it taken off my charges and now I have to drive 20 minutes back to get 3 cinnamon twist...  When I talk to Regina and asked if I can get anything extra because of my troubles, she responds with I can only give you a drink... you have failed to give me the proper order multiple times. I'm tired of this Taco Bell they always fail never coming back here again.  This is not the 1st time this has happened but this is the 1st time I am posting. Next time make your customer happy."}
{"text":"Everytime I have gone to this location the workers are rude and forget at least 1 item from my order."}
{"text":"Consistently giving us inaccurate orders. Specifically on one shift however. The mid shift will always at least forget one item, if not completely mixing up and order with different items. Not to mention waiting in a fast food line for 20+ min defeats the purpose of \"fast food\". We now only come later in the night due to constant lack of attention."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Taco Bell and I will probably go back if they make the changes which are I was there around 11:30 this morning to get some food and lobby was closed I tried the drive through and they were closed now this has not happened the last few times I was there. I've been going here since it was a Taco Bell/ Pizza Hut. You guys normally open at 7 yet the drive through earlier"}
{"text":"This restaurant usually messes up my orders but they did a great job today. They were a little slow but they made sure my food was correct."}
{"text":"I've sat in the drive through line for so long that I've come to my senses that I don't even want to put this filth in my body. So I got to the window and was going Just suck it up and get my stupid quesorito but... they didn't have meat!!! I just said forget it and drove off like I robbed the place. Waste of 20 minutes of my life. Got a salad from Dina's across the street ."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. This is the worst Taco Bell in the state of Arizona. I came in for the first time a while ago, and was met with the absolute worst customer service I have ever seen. The lady working the cash register decided eating a burrito behind the counter was more important than taking my order. I I asked if I could order and was told \"after I'm done eating my burrito\" I couldn't believe it. Then after I ordered I asked for some sauce. She rolled her eyes and scoffed. She needs to be fired. I am never coming back. Worst Taco Bell ever. Enjoy that burrito you terrible employee."}
{"text":"Came here after a doctors appointment with my wife, decided to get the steak nachos box.. said 2x the steak.. this is what I got lmaooo... barely any cheese and barely any steak.. it was pathetic! The restaurant was also dirty when we were there.. all the tables needed to be wiped down and the soda station was nasty!! Manager needs to put his or her foot down.. I will NEVER go back to this Tacobell..."}
{"text":"Came here tonight 4-21-18 to eat dinner with my wife and 3 kids.. there is a couple that's OBVIOUSLY on meth! Acting weird and getting free food from the manager that's OBVIOUSLY ON IT ALSO.. not cool to let tweekers hang out in a FAMILY RESTAURANT... shame on the manager ... will NOT be returning here!!"}
{"text":"Very unsanitary. The Cashier who took my order is also the guy who made my food, which would of been fine if he didn't keep the same gloves on that he was using to make food with AND handling money. He had gloves on while he took my cash, so I questioned him, asking him if he was making the food and he said yes."}
{"text":"Very slow drive through and you must double check your bag for items missing I have caught it more than once"}
{"text":"I love me some Taco Bell! I could probably eat it daily and be totally fine. I recently tried this location for the first time and I just wasn't impressed. I noticed immediately that my car did not have that recognizable \"Taco Bell smell\". But I drove home hoping that was just me and my nose being crazy. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Again, I love Taco Bell! So it was still okay. But the meat was slightly reminiscent of canned dog food and it had a weird spice to it. This is the closest Taco Bell to me now but I will probably drive a little further to go to a different one."}
{"text":"This has been my spot when i just have a craving for taco bell over del taco.  The new renovation is gaudy yet i always had my order spot and the meals prepared are generous. The place from inside and out including the rest room remains clean.  Personnel are good too."}
{"text":"Terrible service, lady taking order was too busy talking to other employees and not getting order right. Have a avocado allergy and it ended up in my burritos even though I specified no avocado. Don't go at night terrible service. Big Taco Bell fan just not this location."}
{"text":"Slowest Taco Bell ever. Don't go during lunch time, because you'll be going back to work very late! I swear they make everything homemade in a Mexican fire pit bc like they take 15min per order! Oh and the workers are not friendly, almost like they have no time to smile. Management must be horrible I guess."}
{"text":"Love this location but the drive thru on a Saturday night is horrible. 30+ minutes and I'm still waiting. I'd go somewhere else but I just got out of work.  At least 4 cars drove off while I was waiting. 2 people working is just not enough at all."}
{"text":"The wait at this Taco Bell is always AWFUL! Sometimes they don't open on time, and they frequently get the order wrong. It's very frustrating, and they really need better training and better customer service."}
{"text":"One of the \"newer\" locations of Taco Bell in the University Area at the intersection of WT Harris and Davis Lake.

I may have hit this taco bell on a bad day.  It was a Friday during the lunch rush so there was an incredibly strange, long wait for food.  Waiting for my food, I was able to observe a couple of other things, the dining room was well kept, except the sauce station was out of fire sauce and I had to ask the guy to grab some for me.

Even though they were behind, the food came out nice and hot.  I ate it in my usually 5 seconds and balling up every wrapper technique.

Overall not too bad.  I've usually had a good track record with the \"newer\" taco bells around the area."}
{"text":"What can I say... it's Taco Bell.  I have a strange obsession with Chalupas so this review will be super biased.  Based on the fact that this location can sling out a great #6 (two chalupas, one taco, and a drink combo) I will give it a solid 3 stars.

I've eaten in the dining room before where there was a strange odor (probably because the water wasn't changed when they wiped down the tables).... but I've been in there before when it was fine.

The drive-thru at this location can get pretty long due to it's location near I-85 and the university, but it's taco bell and they move everyone through in good time (most of the time)."}
{"text":"Every now and then you need a quick, stuff-your-face, meal and Taco Bell is my guilty pleasure.  1)  Drive-thru-ability 2)  Quickness 3)  Ease of eating and 4) Fire sauce.

This Taco Bell on South is your typical Taco Bell... lately, the staffer attending to the drive thru has been super excited (hard not to let the excitement rub off on ya)... but they provide what they promise to provide here and are consistent.  

My new thing is their breakfast burritos for a dollar.  One dollar.  Really hard to argue with that and they are filling.  I've even tried their monstrosity of an idea of their Breakfast Crunchwrap and, not going to lie... it's pretty good.  Breakfast in the palm of your hand.  I only really indulge this once in a while, but something about having hashbrowns, eggs, and meat wrapped up nicely in a tortilla vessel...  great way to start the day.  I probably take about 2 years of life whenever I eat one, but at least I will have died satisfied [insert clever fire sauce message here]."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, I stopped here to get a snack on the way home Friday.  The whole point of me stopping here was to be in and out quickly and this experience was anything but.

I could see they were busy since the drive-thru had wrapped around the building once so I decided to park and go inside to save me some minutes and some screaming and yelling in my personal vehicle.... I ordered a regular value meal thinking it would be faster, but it took a really long time for it to come out.  I'm trying to be objective and not exaggerate, but if I wanted to go to a sit-down restaurant I think the food would have come out faster than this taco bell.  Not only that, but it seems like the people in front of me waited forever as well - it was a group of friends and one of them had already finished eating and his friends were still waiting on their food.

Overall, bad experience - could have been a bad night, but I don't think I will be visiting this location any time again."}
{"text":"This location looks to be brand new.  I went through the drive-thru as it was kind of late (didn't even look to see if the dining room was still open) but the girl on the other end of the intercom system was very nice and my order was displayed on the screen in detail.

My only gripe is the wait... usually you can expect a pretty quick drive thru experience, but I had to wait a few minutes (seemed like hours since I was ridiculously hungry).

The food was hot and fresh and hit the spot.  

One thing to note if you are coming from I-77... this is a little far from the interstate.  Since it was dark, I just had to hope the taco bell was there and it was the \"shining light\" in the sea of darkness.... thank goodness.  I guess this area is still being developed so there are lots of gaps between civilization so it may seem like you are lost trying to get to here."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest , in and out is what I wanted but the line was soooooo long so I ventured into taco bell Mark is great !!!!! he was pleasant, inviting and accomidating. my fault I forgot there was sour cram on the gordita  very clean facility and great guest service . Food mediocre but service above and beyond Thanks again Mark"}
{"text":"If there was a zero star I would have picked it but I guess I'll bump up their weak a## rating. They messed up our order and when we pulled up to talk to them about it they gave us an attitude like we messed up. They put down on the receipt our right order but they still messed up."}
{"text":"I've never been to a more well managed and working Taco Bell. All employees are super nice and my food order is never wrong!!  We have the best Taco bell location in Estrella."}
{"text":"Awful location. Prices for promo tacos that are advertised for $1 everywhere are $1.49 at this spot as well. Not sure how they can get away with charging more for an advertised promo. 
Took forever to get one Taco and side of mashed potatoes. The only reason they get one star is because it has a more modern interior. The employee didn't even greet me when I walked in. Better off going to a different location! 
I want to add that I'm writing this after a few times of going thru the drive thru and not getting the right order. I've also been told they were out of ground beef on another visit."}
{"text":"Today we waited at the drive through for 15 minutes, and we were only the 3rd car in line. We placed our order (under $10), and then waited another 15 min to pull up to the second window and get our food. When we pulled up to the window, we were told that their card machine was down. We didn't have cash, so they informed us that we could not get our food. If we had had a larger order or we had been informed before we placed our order about the credit issue, I would have understood. However, to make someone wait 30 min and then refuse them food because of an issue on the restaurant end is, in my view, ridiculous. Will not be going to this Taco Bell again."}
{"text":"I stopped by there yesterday. The  employees and the manager were friendly and helpful.  I got the mini chicken quesadilla from the value meal and had them add tomatoes and onions. I also got three hard tacos and a Diet Pepsi. 

They have free WiFi. The store is very clean. I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here there's a problem with my order. Never had this issue at any other Taco Bell's. Last time I went they said they couldnt make my order because they were out of meat of all things, this time they got my entire order wrong. I ordered a steak quesadilla meal with a hard shell taco, I got a chicken quesadilla that was folded all jacked up & some beans! Couldn't even get one part of my order right."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab a bite to eat on my lunch break.... I ordered one of the new shredded chicken quesaritos (which I do have to say are quite tasty!) and a soft taco with NO LETTUCE..... needless to say when the receipt clearly says \"no lettuce\" you get it anyways! I get that this is a simple mistake, but the point is that it is a simple mistake, just don't put the lettuce on- not that special of an order!

Unfortunately I used the drive thru, so I was unable to go into the restaurant to get the mistake cleared up immediately, so the taco was donated to the trash bin at my office."}
{"text":"I love Taco Bell, I know a lot of people would be shocked or disgusted by that but it really is probably my favorite food - not just fast food, so my review could be very biased. I just moved out here and this location is literally within about 90 seconds of where I live (driving) so I come here often. Because of my bias towards the food though - which is also fast food so you really do know what you're getting, same here as any other Taco Bell - I'll just go over the other aspects.

I haven't eaten inside before but the outside area of the location is clean and well located/easy to get in and out of. The drive thru speaker (the device, not the person speaking) is really not loud enough especially if it's a busier time of day as the traffic on the road right there can genuinely make it hard to even tell if anyone is talking (it's THAT quiet). This is pretty bad but it's never made it a thing that ended up a huge problem, just a few times of having to ask them to repeat what they said. The accuracy of orders for me is currently 100%. The speed of getting your order in to getting your food is fast. The staff themselves, having dealt with multiple people at the drive-thru now, are all really nice and almost have an In-n-Out vibe of really caring about your experience even if you're just passing through in your car. And for the food, just as fantastic as any other spot and in terms of what they might change, like portion size for example, no problems there so far either.

If you like Taco Bell then there's nothing bad to say about this specific one."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. This is absolutely the WORST fast food restaurant. It never fails that they are out of something!  This is a Taco Bell kfc combo fast food chain and they have been out of everything from soda to sour cream to ACTUALLY CHICKEN!!!  How can a KFC Taco Bell have NO CHICKEN. THIS PLACE IS THE WORST!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say about Taco Bell, pretty much we all know what to expect, but at this particular location, very clean, fast and fresh food, friendly staff...I would come back to this location"}
{"text":"Person at drove thru was personable,  prefer was fast,  and the tacos were tasty.  Just what I needed!"}
{"text":"TBell like every other about 50% of the time service can be real slow though."}
{"text":"I would give it less than one star. I was excited that a Taco Bell was gonna be up in my community but every time we come seems like you get bad service, rude looks, and most of all nasty tasting cold food."}
{"text":"I checked online before going to make sure they were open. They advertise being open at 0700 on Sunday. Tell me why myself and 2 other cars were in the drivethru at 0715 and no one served us. There were 3 employee vehicles (im assuming they were employees) and not one person in line got served. If you advertise being open at 7... be open at 7."}
{"text":"Delicious food and kind workers and I left feeling good about eating there it is a must have for a good quick meal.would go again"}
{"text":"Do not go here. I pulled up and the lady yelled can you please just wait. I hadn't even said a word. I said no problem. After a few minutes she came back and said okay what do you want. I started to order and it just went silent. I said hello and just got a sigh and heard the people talking crap in the back ground. Pretty much going to spit in food. So I just pulled out and left. And the girl at the window just looked at me and shrugged. Right across the street is McDonald's or even salad and go. Treat you much better. I understand being slow but talking bad about customer, being upset with us for being busy and doing God knows what to our food because of it isn't acceptable."}
{"text":"Next time I want to wait a full 15 minutes for a PLAIN bean burrito, I'll just go to NOBU."}
{"text":"Very bad service, waited forever for someone to take my order when they saw I was waiting and they were not even busy."}
{"text":"Been to too many T Bells to count in my life, but this one is a standout. The restaurant is new, and the design is modern, clean, and fresh. The employees were courteous and attentive. The food was fresh and satisfying. Loved the T Bell- themed paintings on the walls too!  Very impressive!"}
{"text":"The place was super clean, the employees were happy! Service was quick and the food was good, better than the one over on Octillio or Ellsworth or somewere, where it was all beans not matter what you ordered.
I like this place, may by they cleaned up their act since all those reviews."}
{"text":"This was a very aMaZing place the Tacos tasted like tacos with a magic taco in a taco with no tacos with alot of tacos everyone should eat tacos here becuase they taste like a taco"}
{"text":"Yeah, I got food poisoning from this Taco Bell once, too, but hey -- it wasn't that bad. I still freakin' LOVE Taco Bell and will go back countless more times (and I already have since then). They never seem daunted by my odd special requests, and let's face it: Even though I enjoy my fair share of fine dining & ultra-hip restaurants, there are just some times where all you really want is some take-home Taco Bell (yes, even sober).

...(and, yes, I mainly gave it 5 stars to counteract the last reviewer's 1 star. It's freakin Taco Bell, man, not Mundo.)"}
{"text":"It is mexican by a stretch of the meaning.  The orders are always wrong!  Have to check before you leave thw place and hold up the drice thru.   The food is wdible and cheap.   Good for a bsic burrito or such."}
{"text":"Employees are friendly and food is okay but every single time we've come here, and we come here a lot, they've ALWAYS forgotten something or messed up the order somehow. Can't count on this location to be consistent, check your bags before you leave and if you have a custom order you may want to open up your food to to make sure they made it right."}
{"text":"Decent food, clean interior, friendly staff but they have misplaced items in our order multiple times, we always have to check to make sure everything is correct. Have had a few problems getting double charged using the mobile app, but 95% of the time managers are on top of things and will help get any issues resolved. It's what you would expect of a Taco Bell haven't had any horror stories from the food, actually packaged and \"cooked\" really well here. Happy they can properly put together our unique vegetarian combinations every time."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I love Taco Bell! Remember how everyone loved Pizza Hut when you were a kid? Well, I liked Pizza Hut, but preferred Taco Bell. I know, weird right?

Back in the day, they used to have the Taco Bell Grande, which was a bigger version of the Taco Supreme. I loved it! I think I like Taco Bell because their food is simple, tasty and cheap. Here are my favorites:

-Taco Supreme
-Chicken Supreme Chalupa
-Nachos
-Mango Frutista (They are oh so addicting!)

I have never dined here, but the drive-thru is always fast and friendly. They have screwed up my order a few times, but I guess you sort of expect that from any fast food place. Now that the weather is starting to heat up, I'll be back often for those Frutistas!"}
{"text":"When your on a small budget this place hits the mark. Cheap, Fast, and Filling !! Who needs Roman Noodles when you have Taco Bell ! It just works. For Indain Trail its a welcome addition to the fast food markets i think anyway."}
{"text":"When we're hungry for some express tacos or burrito or whatever, we come here because it's just 3 minutes from our house .It's my husband who loves Mexican food, I mean I like it..but it's not the type of food that I would crave for. This place is okay, but not all the time. There are times that they can be not satisfactory.. There are some incident that they do not put all your orders in the bag. I don't know if they forgot, or it's just pure negligence! 2 nights ago, we went to their drive thru, confident that we got everything, which we had, but soon as we're home, I noticed when I grabbed my chicken chicken burrito, it's too thin like there's nothing in there. So I opened it up, and I guess what? I'm right! There's barely nothing there! There was just a tiny little bit of rice, 3 pieces of some tiny chicken, and that's it! 
I am so disappointed!!! Both 2 burritos are the same, the other one is even worse! So we went back, my hubby still approached them kindly expressing our concern and inconvenience, I mean like hello if this thing happened to other people, they would get a very crunchy swearing and all the evil names already! We still chose to be kind. 
They made new burritos for us, I thought they're going to make it up for us, like a big fat burrito, but I'm wrong. They just put a little more rice and some chicken. And gave us some cinnamon crackers as a consolation! Big deal! 
Well it is what it is, and they are what they are! I still like Del Taco better! They have REAL BURRITO there! We only come here because it's the closest to the house."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  11 minutes to get my order inside with only 2 people in  front of me.  They pay attention to the drive through only, and that too looks slow. Dont go here!  They are rude too!"}
{"text":"I've been to this TBell many times. It's always super slow, but usually at least correct. Tonight was a joke. Why do I come here? 

Ordered online via the app. The app is nice so you can customize things and since it's digital they usually get it right! Nope. Not tonight. Everything was wrong except the fries. The fries were exceptional. 

We sat in the drive through for, no joke, over 20 minutes. Completely ridiculous. And it's not because they were busy... there were exactly 3 vehicles ahead of us. That's all. 

I don't know if they are extremely understaffed or if they just employ people who hate their job, but something has got to change."}
{"text":"Slowest effing place known to man!!!! 30 mins to get FAST food. Are you kidding me? Thought I would give this place one more shot but from now on unless you get some people who know what the hell they are doing or close your doors."}
{"text":"I rarely eat here but tonight was craving it. I was not very impressed with the service, starting with a guy who took my order. I could hear him eating chewing food while he was taking my order. The cashier at the window after handed me mu CC back asked if I want any sauce which I told her that I would like some hot sauce but when I got my food there wasn't anu sauce or napkins was given in my bag, smh. I will probably won't be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"What is it about Taco Bell?  It's consistently good, and a GREAT value!!!  I crave their bean burritos, they are so good. I order them with extra onions, gives them a little \"crunch\". Try their green sauce, it's SO good."}
{"text":"Was greeted by a very welcoming young woman at the drive through. Very professional, smile on her face the entire time. Nicest employee I've encountered there; the employees are all very decent there. Great service!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered a Fiesta Taco Salad because it was my favorite growing up  and it was NOT good. The refried beans tasted burnt and the whole salad tasted off. Maybe it was the salsa? I spent $5-6 and couldn't finish the meal because it just didn't taste right.

The cashier was friendly, a little slow though."}
{"text":"Usually the drive through takes a year and a half to get through but this time was an exception. I got through in less than 5 minutes. The attendant was very nice and got me what I needed quickly. My order was made correctly and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I ask for a sierra mist taste weir. Ask to change and the employe give a little attitude. The tacos lettuce was disgusting...."}
{"text":"Run! Seriously, just keep driving, do not stop. Cabinet doors for cleaning supplies standing open with brooms leaned up against him, employees with their shirts up above their fat rolls, unwashed tables, empty condiment and straw bins... orders took forever. Saw two different people have to get their orders fixed because of so many mistakes (One couple was given to completely wrong combos than what they ordered). Everything from the filthy interior to the creepy clientele and unwashed employees just screamed health hazard. Don't risk your health... Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"just wanted a quick bite to eat really nothing today just got the xxl nachos and freeze -- I think I got food poising not feeling good will call in am and report"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick, cheap bite through the drive-thru, but the line was backed up, they were getting swamped. The employee in the window Carter offered a free drink or cinnamon twist for the wait. First time in awhile a drive-thru gave me customer service like that in a long time."}
{"text":"Oh my! I am finding myself reviewing taco bells more than expected! This Taco Bell was slow. Ohhhhhh myyyyy. Don't you hate that? When one persons order takes forever? But everyone is held up? I'm still giving it 4 stars tho buddy cause they remembered my spork and apologized for the wait. The food was good. Taco Bell! They have this new chicken crisper thing. I was confused by it! It is like a chicken finger in a small tortilla! No other stuff just a sauce! Not a lettuce! Strange! I ate it tho! Omnomnom. Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Oh man. This is the fastest Taco Bell drive thru ever. In the drive thru line there were two ahead of me, but once I ordered 2 things those cars had pulled away and at the window they already had my food. Order correct and delicious (for Taco Bell) asked if I wanted sauce. Included a spork. A-ok. Short review, but it's Taco Bell! I got a cheesy bean and rice burrito and triple layer nachos. They were out of chicken taquito roll-ups FYI. Now I'm just being silly, but they WERE out of taquitos. It's Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Yes this is Taco bell but this is the worst Taco bell I've ever been to. Most of the time my order is messed up and everytime it takes super long. I actually like Taco Bell but refuse to go to this location"}
{"text":"Not only are they stupid slow for the small amount of business they get, the staff is RUDE. Another customer had mention that they were going to need a minute and the rude cashier just says \"Well you got until 3\" it being 2:45 and then she started laughing with what I assume to be the manager? Just rude with the worst attitude."}
{"text":"I have no idea in the world what they put in their food but I'm still belching it 7 hours later.  Not a good thing."}
{"text":"Their drive through needs updating, otherwise your average tacobell and long john combo store, the server was very nice"}
{"text":"I'm beyond happy to have a taco bell right in my neighborhood. I love the food and customer service has been phenomenal. Thank you for being here in estrella mountain!"}
{"text":"It only took about 20 minutes before I even got to the window I decided just cancel my order and go give my money to someone else

6months later. Still just as bad."}
{"text":"I hardly go now a days by when I do go I always order the grilled steak soft taco and steak quesadilla! I always do drive thru; fast service all the time!"}
{"text":"Most consistent. Decent staff. I've only received food from the drive threw. But they have always been most consistent with their food. Not a bad dollar menu either. I'll go here over the one in down town Mesa."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best location. They may seem slow, but they take the time to get your order correct. Food is always warm and just prepared."}
{"text":"They pretty much get my order wrong everytime!!! Today I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with extra red sauce and no onions.... I got a bunch of beans and a tortilla. No cheese no red sauce!! But yet my receipt read my order correctly!!! And how the hell do you serve a bean and cheese burrito with no cheese?? Grrrr.... I guess I'll have to hold the line up while I check my order from now on!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, fast food is fast food. But this place has got to have THE best service of all time. It's like disneyland at Taco Bell. No exaggeration."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst taco Bell I have ever been to. I come here to order a simple dinner box and tell them that I don't want anything else. No drink. Just the box. They will not take no for an answer. I don't want a water, I just want my dinner box. I sit and wait at the drive through for 20 minutes during my break and only have 5 minutes to eat it until I go back to work. I'm then presented with a flattened pancake taco and napkins thrown everywhere in the back with grease hanging out the bottom. I go to pay for my meal and they just shut the window on me when I think I'm getting my food but I'm there waiting another 5 minutes with no clue where my food is at. Don't bother asking for recommendations either because these people will eat tar if you asked them to"}
{"text":"Can you really go wrong with a bean burrito? I love them here.  They are cheap which makes it even better.  Their hard taco supreme and enchritos are also the bomb.  Obviously I cannot eat here everyday or I'd be the size of a blimp - so this place is for when I am feeling super lazy and do not want to cook - or as a late night, I've been out too long kind of meal."}
{"text":"The manager, Nina, on duty tonight sucks. She had no care in the world, had a shitty attitude, and proceeded to ask me if I wanted sauce FIVE  times after I complained about my order/ said no the first time. I understand being a manager at Taco Bell isn't a life long dream, and I'm not expecting dive star customer service, but after a long day at work I'd like to go to Taco Bell, receive the correct order, and not be talked to with a snarky attitude. She also proceeded to not give me a receipt, thinking I wouldn't be able to read her name tag. Game's on."}
{"text":"ehhh employees need to pretend they enjoy to work"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 star rating.

After I picked my son up from school he asked for Taco Bell. It's cheap, he will eat it and I don't have to cook. Win, win...

Arrived at about 3:30 on a Monday. We opted to go inside because he did not know what he wanted. Big pet peeve when someone in front of me in the drive thru line has no idea and takes them 10 minutes to order.

One person in the dining room in front of us who obviously didn't get the right order was trying to correct it.

A gentleman took our order who I believe was the manager. He was pleasant enough. We ordered a Dorito Gordita Big Box and upgraded the drink to a freeze since it was \"happy hour\". While we were waiting someone in the drive thru received the wrong order and someone that had already left came into the dining room with the wrong order.  Uh oh!

We waited about 5 minutes when a very rude young boy called out our order. I found it strange that he was trying to call my name which he clearly couldn't pronounce when I never gave Mr. Order Taker it.

Thankfully our order was correct.  Food was average Taco Bell. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing right either.

We continue to visit this location because we usually have a very nice lady by the name of Carol take our order and she gives us outstanding customer service.

Dining room appeared to be clean with drink station average. All sauces and napkins stocked."}
{"text":"This location has really gone down hill .... they keep messing up the orders ,forgetting half the order and the customer service is beyond horrible! I don't know what's changed the last few months but they have definitely lost my family as customers!"}
{"text":"Taco Bell was very busy, but the food we ordered was fast and fresh.  No complaints here, for Taco Bell it was very tasty and the employee that waited on us gave us the Senior discount without asking!"}
{"text":"I go to this Taco Bell when I am wanting something not to filling and inexpensive. I also go to this Taco Bell because of the people that work there. Several times they have suggested I order a special item that gave me more for less money. How many times do you get someone that is looking our for how much you spend today. I have eaten at different Taco Bells for years but this is the only place I have ever gotten the great customer service they offer."}
{"text":"The drive thru here is absolutely ridiculous!! We sat in line for 30 minutes! We would've left but we were blocked in which is bs too! Food is ok but the service was horrible, no sorry for the wait or anything!!"}
{"text":"Let me start with I LOVE Taco Bell.... but not this one. This is the closet one to my house. I am not sure if I just have terrible luck with this location or what, but I already know that anytime I order something is not going to be right. 
Again, I try to give them a chance, don't get me wrong the staff are great, but it's my food. I order the new nacho fries box, she asks if I was sauce, yes Fire. 
Anyways, I get home open my box and right away I can tell the fries aren't but fresh the are soggy  On top of that no sauce  Then as I'm eating my tacos they are cold!!! Like cold people! Every time I go this happens, cold, not fresh food. I know you aren't a high quality restaurant, but people are still coming to enjoy food. All I am asking is you take a second to provide your customers with hot food or even the right food!!! Please someone look into this, I beg you!!!!!!! A very concerned customer who loves Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast for the first time at this place... the girls making the food kept asking questions like they didn't know their own menu.  I ordered the Country Grilled Burrito.  I got a sausage egg and cheese burrito.  I ordered the jalepeno honey chicken biscuit.  The chicken was rubbery, and the honey was ice cold from the refrigerator in a cup in my bag.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 2 years now, I've never had a problem with them. Drive thru can be a bit slow, but their chicken burrito, grillers and quesadillas are hot and delicious, so worth the wait. Everyone's very courteous and I can see them working hard to make the food in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The staff at this location are rude, incompetent, and unprofessional. They can never seem to get the order right no matter how many times I have had to explain it to them. Often times they don't confirm the order on screen but simply show the total and briefly yell, \"Thank you\" as if to move you along the process faster.

I don't recommend this location unless you are looking for a surprise item in your to-go bag each order."}
{"text":"Awful! This location closes at 1am, or so they say. Showed up at 12:50 tonight and waited, said hello a few times, two cars in parking lot and no response. Guess they close at 12:50 and not 1 as advertised. Have some respect for your job, because there are plenty of people that WOULD appreciate it!"}
{"text":"The lady who took the order was a bit slow...we have to repeat our order over and over again. The cherry starburst that I ordered was soar and overly sweat....Food is average. I will probably not come back here"}
{"text":"I feel a little silly writing a review for a fast food chain because really, the food is the same no matter where you go - or it should be at least. But I have to write a review for this location because their service is so fantastic!

I always drive through and am greeted by someone in a cheery voice. For example, \"How are you today?\" \"I'm good thanks, how are you?\" \"I'm doing taco-tastic, thanks for asking!\" or if you say you need a minute before ordering, \"Sorry, we're all out of minutes, would you like some seconds instead?\" I would accuse all the employees of being high on the job (it IS taco bell, after all), but they're all so perky that that can't possibly be it. 

One time they forgot my cinnabon bites and I had to go back for them - no sweat getting them, but inconvenient because making u-turns in this town is a huge hassle. 

Still, even though the Warm Springs location is closer for me, I always come to the Horizon Ridge one just because they are so much nicer to interact with. One time at the Warm Springs location, they handed me my food and said, \"here you go\" and turned away. No \"thank you,\" no \"have a nice day,\" nothing! I don't get out a lot, and if the only interaction I'm going to have all day is with a taco bell employee, I want it to be a pleasant one! (Boy that last line makes me sound SUPER pathetic.....)"}

{"text":"Every once in a while, I get a craving for a Chulapa, and it's off to Taco Bell.  Love those things, and unlike some places, they've gotten my order right EVERY time!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, however, my order is never correct when I order from the Taco Bell Menu. When it is finally made correctly, tostadas are poorly made and dumped on their side. This place has so much potential if someone could just get the team better training and accountability. Please!"}
{"text":"I just think they throw whatever is around them in a bag and say it's your order. Literally nothing you ask for is ever correct."}
{"text":"On this particular Sunday morning, service in the drive through was on point. The lady was very friendly and food was ready quick. No complaints here."}
{"text":"impressed only by the fact the lady taking my order didn't seem to speak any English but did manage to cut me off each time I started talking to confirm my order wrong. I ordered one meal combo...ONE & she somehow figured out how to mess the whole thing up. it took me 3 minutes at the speaker to get her to understand what I actually wanted, which in actuality wasn't hard. just no sauce, that's all."}
{"text":"First time we have been here.
Lady that took our order was rude.
The guy that made our food was slow.
The food was less than edible.
The cinnamon twists had hard crunchy (like u can't chew) spots in them.

We won't be back.

Go around the corner to Filibertos..."}

{"text":"I am not happy about my service. I have just gotten off from work and I came to Taco Bell at 9:50 and when through drive thru. Waited about 10 minutes for someone to take my order. The employees were just standing around on their phones. Didn't even bother to ask if I wanted any sauce."}
{"text":"Typical Taco Bell.... Though the lady at the window was nice enough to sell me a combo instead of what I ordered because it was cheaper. :-)"}
{"text":"I used to like this location, and would go somewhat regularly. There was this nice guy behind the counter who was extremely nice, never got my order wrong, and was an all-around good guy. 

Then I went for lunch today. The place was deserted except for one person who was waiting for his food. I had to wait for a while for the people in the back to tell the guy (the only one in the place who can use the cashier apparently) that there was someone waiting up front. The guy finally comes from around the corner and it looks like I woke him up or something.

Anyway, I order and get my food only to find out once I've sat down that they've forgotten my nachos. I go up to the counter again (prompting a 2-3 minute wait), and I tell them about the nachos. I point out to them that I can see the nachos sitting on the counter back there, but they insist on making a new one. Whatever. I sit down. The girls in the back were walking around with scowls.

The food was sub par, even for Taco Bell. They really skimped on the meat. 

There was an unfortunate couple there. They ordered just after I did, and after 15 minutes one of the girls from the back came out and said that they were out of ground beef. How in the hell is a Taco Bell out of ground beef? That also shows that even after 15 minutes, they STILL hadn't started his order. I was talking with him about the crappy service and he was getting increasingly more annoyed, saying that he'll never go to this location again. I can't blame him. 

Anyway, after about 20 minutes or so, I leave and that couple finally get their food. In that time, several groups of teenagers came in and while they were waiting for Lurch Addams to get to the counter to order, I told them that the food is taking forever and that they're out of ground beef. They left, and I felt like a hero for taking away from this location's business. 

To the owner: just because it's a Taco Bell, doesn't mean it's a good idea to get your labor from the local bus stop. Hire someone who cares and maybe your restaurant won't be a ghost town."}
