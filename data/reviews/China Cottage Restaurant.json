{"text":"Quite possibly the worst food I've ever eaten in my entire life. Literally. We ordered the chili beef, garlic chicken, and masala noodles. The chili beef was just spicy. It had absolutely no flavour. The garlic chicken was too sweet. And the masala noodles were the most horrific food I have probably ever eaten. They were extremely dry and there was so much \"masala\" powder on them that brining the fork two inches from my lips caused me to gag. If you're near Markham and Steeles and are craving Hakka food, make the drive up to 14th and eat at Fredericks!."}
{"text":"Yum! Dropped in here last evening on the way home because traffic was bad and I had been meaning to check it out. 

Friendly and helpful (and cute) waiters, modern and welcoming d√©cor, delicious food. The Hakka Vegetables are kind of like tempura - breaded with a very light touch, deep fried and a bit spicy. SO tasty! Great value for the prices."}
{"text":"I go there for the lunch special very frequently.
Its great. You get more like a dinner portion for under $7."}
{"text":"Dark, cheap & below average food. We ordered Pad Thai, one with chicken the others vegetarian. All three came out after a while, no veggies, no egg, and all with .5 ounces of what looked to be chicken. Asked our server to fix the mistake and they left the plates and came back and finally took the plates away from the vegetarians only. They came out with two pad Thai with veggies that looked better than the first batch but there was no flavour other than hot/spicy. Would not recommend coming here for Pad Thai, ever."}
{"text":"We came here for the lunch special and the portions was massive! The special included a bunch noodle and rice dishes with the choice of one of the following an egg roll, a soup of the day or a pop. This Could easily feed two hungry people with one portion. I got the Manchurian haka noodles with chicken. Over all they put alot of cabbage and a tad too much soy sauce for my liking.  The service was great and the food came out fast. Will drop by the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Szechuan chicken, Szechuan fries, chicken 88 was really good along with simple Haka noodles. Fried banana was a very nice dessert."}
{"text":"Great food & fast service! 
Ordered chicken 88, lollipop chicken and szechuan fried rice"}
{"text":"Love the food here use to have food here almost every other day, the quality and texture of food have definitely changed over the past years but still one of my favourite Hakka restaurants. Love the ambiance and the staff is great too. Definitely recommend Hakka food fans to try this place out. First timers tip order Pepper chicken, chilli chicken, schezwan fried rice and one of my dear favourites Hakka vegetables. You will never go wrong with this."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere although the wait is toooo long.  Quality of food is average, prices are reasonable.

We ordered their Cottage soup... Weird taste... Did not get it.

We ordered their shrimp pakoras... Spicy breaking but WHERE'S THE SHRIMP???   

Their Hakka noodles are very average.

Fredericks is waaaaay better food.  Won't go back. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Food portion and cost ratio is excellent. You get well worth your $$ especially when you're with a group 
Taste is reasonable but the noodles just tasted like soy and manchurian eggplant was too bland.. As if it was steamed then added to garlic soy sauce? 
Hot and sour soup was good more on the sour side"}
{"text":"Price and the portions size are the only positives about this place. The flavor lacked in the dishes that were ordered (Manchurian CKN Noodes - Had too much soy sauce which had a bitter after taste after every bite) & (Mixed Veges with Beef - Bland and had too much salt in the dish). This will likely be my first and last visit as I was extremely disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I don't understand why this place is as hyped as it is. If you're looking for quality Hakka food try Lin gardens on pharmacy and sheppard. The food isn't as advertised and the chicken tastes old. Service is rushed and inattentive."}
{"text":"I really love their chilli chicken with gravy when i order it both as dine in and take out option.  But I like their Manchurian Chicken noodles too.
Only issue with dining-in is that i often feel like they are rushing you out after a while. And even the waiters and waitress don't recommend getting Malaysian option which is nice of them, but why have it if its not good. 
The prices are fair and to be honest its great if you go with family because the portion are pretty big and u can share and take left overs. I would recommend reserving tables if big group or if u want booth and don't go during rush hour."}
{"text":"Extra huge portions of servings. Nice place! 

Good Hakka & Thai cuisine..."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, I am a frequent customer here and have never been disappointed. The management and servers are always great and their take out/pick up timing is always on point, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite local hakka restaurant. Spicier and more authentic tasting than Fredricks. If you like spicy food, this is the place for you! 

Servers are always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Portions are big, prices are low, service is fast, and the food is delicious. We come here a couple of times a month for our regular cravings and they never disappoint. Must try dishes are the Mango Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Chicken 88, and the Chef's Special Shrimp (deep fried and battered jumbo shrimp). Fair warning - the food is quite greasy!"}
{"text":"After an eventful day at the Zoo and Rouge Hill Beach, my lady-friend and I joined our friend for a not-a-surprise-but-it-is-a-surprise birthday/farewell dinner. We had a huge table of around 20 people, and there was plenty of food to go around!

Restaurant size:
Nice and spacious, plenty of room to accommodate for larger groups (such as ours) and smaller groups (maybe such as yours?). Plenty of ambient lighting to get your hunger-mood right.

Food quality:
Being with a group who really likes their spice, we were introduced to a bunch of Indian/hakka dishes which varied in spice; all were ultra delicious and flavourful. However, some of the dishes had quite a bit of oil too. But hey, it adds more flavour! We had predominantly rice-based dishes, with some deep fried fish cutlets too. 

Service:
Even though we had our own reserved seating and priority, I could see that there were adequate servers for other tables as well. Servers were courteous and prompt in refilling water when asked.

Final thoughts:
It was a great opportunity to try a number of dishes here, and it would be a mistake to pass it by if you're looking for Indian/hakka! I'd definitely come back again with a smaller group and might even try asking for less oil in some of the dishes."}
{"text":"When China Cottage first opened, I'd have to say it was one of my favourite hakka restaurants in my area. But sadly it's a hit or miss. So much that I stopped ordering  there. I decided to go back and order for my family. The crispy beef was very hard and could not chew it enough to swallow it! The shrimp in the green curry was not deveined properly either. The people there are super nice but this review is solely based on the food!"}
{"text":"Service is slow so expect to wait awhile for your food. The cantonese chow mein and deep fried icecream is a must here!"}
{"text":"I love their Hakka Fish, and Chicken 88. Their food is mostly spicy but you can ask them to make it mild. Good service and nice people."}
{"text":"I've heard of China Cottage before but have never eaten there. My boyfriend was craving spicy food and knew I've never been there but have wanted to try it. Upon entering the restaurant, you see nice dim lighting and interesting pieces on the walls. It had kind of a romantic cozy atmosphere but doesn't require fancy clothing. Our waiter was very helpful and informative. He explained a little bit about the dishes we were ordering to ensure we got what we really wanted. He even asked if we wanted them to take down the spiciness haha! He got me really worried! Had me thinking lava will be coming out of every orifice! We said to keep it as is.

The food came out nice and fresh and didn't take too long. We ordered the chicken 88, crispy beef, and chicken fried rice. We didn't realize the dishes already came with white rice but go big or go home right? It wasn't as spicy as I anticipated nor did it overpower the flavour of the dish. The chicken 88 was so delicious! I'm so glad the portions were quite large because having it for lunch at work the next day was awesome. The chicken was full of flavour and moist, not dry or chewy. The crispy beef, even with a sauce on it, it held up its crunchy factor. My mouth is watering from just thinking about it! This will definitely be a restaurant I'll visit again if I felt like some good, quick, hakka food."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday lunch to celebrate with some Hakka food at low prices and generous portions. 

We came as a party of 16 and the thing with our party is that a lot of people don't like spicy food, while only a handful of us including myself like the heat so this reflects the rating.

I ordered the spicy Chicken 88 which looks like a cross between tandoori chicken and a dry stir fry of chicken breast with chillis, garlic and coriander. I was in spice lovers heaven with a sweet burn in my mouth as I wolfed down the generous portions. Friend beside me ordered the spicy cashew chicken which was also delicious.

My friends who didn't like spicy food didn't fare so well. While the Manchurian chicken rice and noodle was reported as good, I heard a lot of disappointment from those that had the non spicy stir fry noodle dishes, and the sweet and sour fish. Looking at their menu, it looks like they cater to the clientele that likes spicy food, so make sure you order their signature spicy dishes and not their poorly done non-spicy ones!

Oh, prices at $6.75 for lunch specials including either an egg roll, sweet and sour soup, or pop is an absolute steal, with most of our party getting takeout boxes for afterwards."}
{"text":"Really liked this place when it first opened. Stopped by this past weekend and was shocked to 
see how badly it had gone down. The couple at the next table who had arrived after us got  their soup right a way while we had been waiting 15mins. Finally I had to ask the waiter what was going on. He mentioned it was a new Chef and he was messing up. He finally brought the soup. There was a big group of Ladies celebrating a Friend's Birthday, we noticed they
had been served wrong items and they were being sent back. Finally our Food arrived, 
luke warm at best. By this time we were starving so just went ahead and ate it. The waiter 
did come back to ask if everything was ok, and I made it a point to mention the cold food. 
I give this place 1 star only for the quality and taste of food which surprisingly was still good.
Next time I will drive the extra few mins to Fredericks or Hakka King.."}
{"text":"Not only do they have the most incredible chili chicken, but they are PERFECT for those with Celiac Disease and food allergies/restrictions/sensitivities. Someone is always available that is knowledgeable about the food and its ingredients. They cater and alter dishes for you with no hesitation."}
{"text":"If you are craving hakka Chinese. This place is it. Delicious food and perfect blend of spices. We ordered tom yum soup which was tasty and spicy. We also got sweet and sour chicken, beef chilli, chicken 88, chowmein and chopsuey. Chopsuey and sweet and sour chicken were my favorite. In soup I love the hot and sour and hubby loves the chicken corn soup. Over all a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food. And lots of choices for most dietary needs. Btw '88' is a flavor.  So whatever you get from the menu with the 88 will have that flavor. And it all tasted good. To bad it's 1.5 hours from home."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location than the Pharmacy location and I love it. The minute you enter and are seated, the service is great. They listen to what you want. The food is really good. Everything I've ordered, from friend rice, to sweet and sour chicken balls to chilli chicken is fantastic. This place is great for families or just a quick bite. If you don't have time to sit in the restaurant, the take out option is just as good. This is by far one of my favourite Hakka restaurants. You won't be disappointed. Ask the server to clarify foods you're not sure off (Szechuan vs hakka). They will also make certain dishes less spicy if requested. The portion sizes are great so you will always have enough to eat."}
{"text":"The ambiance is somewhat romantic. It's dark with some light fixtures. The furniture (tables, booths and chairs) are very comfortable.

It's average. I expected more spices and flavors. We ordered chili fish dry, ginger chicken, chicken pakora, etc. None of the dishes were spicy enough for me. I had to use the hot peppers from the vinegar jar (provided on your table) to enhance taste and spice. We had hakka noodle too - it was a little too greasy for my taste. The pakora was delicious and tastes even better with vinegar! We like the manager there - he is very friendly and wears a giant smile when we arrive. I usually go during lunch - it's a better deal with same portion size."}
{"text":"Good Hakka- Good Lunch Special- Great Catering"}
{"text":"One if my favourite go to restaraunts. Its amazing service was fine and the ambience was good."}
{"text":"Great service n prices chicken 88 is by far the best didh ive had there. Its super spicy and flavourful. Asked for it in mild and it was just the right amount"}
{"text":"Love this place! Can't say enough good things about it. There's a great lunch special for $6.75 that comes with a massive portion and your choice of pop, soup, or egg roll. 

We usually get the chicken or beef 88 and schezwan fried rice. Beef or chicken 88 are their speciality. It's super red and flavourful from all the spices that go into it. It comes with rice, too. The schezwan fried rice is super yummy, too. It's also really red and flavourful. They are both a bit spicy, but I love spicy foods! They also offer a variety of fish, chicken, beef, and thai foods. We have tried their pad thai and green curry. Both were delicious, but we are partial to our regular order. 

It's always busy there with people dining in and taking out. Service is consistently friendly and courteous. The owners are very nice people, too. Quiet and sweet. I used to serve them and their entire family at my old job and they were always incredibly nice."}
{"text":"Another Hakka Chinese place in Scarborough? Surprise! Apparently is this the most readily available ethnic food in the suburb. The food was decent here, however the service was terrible. I suppose it was because there were a lot of people here , however I'm not really sure this is much of an excuse. The food took forever to get there, the waiter seemed clueless, and the bar wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Still loving this location and food.  China Cottage has very reasonably priced dishes that are absolutely delicious.

Can't get enough of the Chili Chicken."}
{"text":"Love the Mumbai chicken (really spicy) and the chicken corn soup."}
{"text":"Hakka food poisoning restaurant.  Hope you like sweet and sour diarrhea.
Poor service, unsanitary, and lack lustre food.  Shut this place down asap."}
{"text":"Hakka food is one of my favorite foods and I always seem to have a food craving for it! I've been here a few times and loved the hakka food here. It was quite busy when we came here on a chilly Saturday evening. It's a small restaurant with limited seating so it's recommended to make reservations here. We waited for about 10 minutes before getting a table. We ordered  the Szechuan vegetable hakka food, the vegetable paneer, the Mumbai chicken and the kung pao veg pakora. It's always good to ask for a pitcher of water when you are devouring spicy foods. The food came here pretty quickly with the first dish coming in 10 minutes. Staff were friendly and they were quick and efficient with the order. We thoroughly enjoyed our food. My favorite was the Mumbai chicken with a bowl of rice which tasted quite delicious with just the right amount of spice. Definitely a personal favorite of mine now and will order again and again when I come back here. Overall, a pretty decent dining experience for some good hakka food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times; and the most recent visit wasn't as nearly as good as I had remembered how it used to be. We take some fault in ordering mostly vegetarian dishes but I've had vegetarian hakka food done good before as well. But if you're looking for Hakka food, there's plenty of better options closeby in the area. 

This time we had ordered the bombay chicken, the veggie pakora, veggie manchurian paneer fried rice, and some chili paneer. The veggie pakora was a disappointment; I was expecting it to be similar spice wise to the meat pakoras but it wasn't anything similar. They were small discs of mashed veggies and was quite dry, even with the sweet chili sauce. The chili paneer was probably the best dish of the night; the paneer itself was nice, chewy, and soft in tandoori spices. The rice was rather heavy and flat and we got tired of eating it rather quickly. The beef was decent but there's definitely better options to choose. I just think you need to order the right dishes here. Stick with the tried and true dishes because things can be hit and miss here.

Service was pleasant, the portions were massive, and the price is definitely cheaper than other competitors which are pluses of China Cottage!"}
{"text":"Two words: lunch special. HUGE portion for under $7. I always get the chili chicken with gravy. It's not spicy at first but it really creeps up on you halfway through the meal. I love it. For a quick lunch, call ahead for your order and pick it up! You can't go wrong with China Cottage. 4/5."}
{"text":"Food was previously amazing but quality of food has gone down hill. 

Noodles are dry and lack sauce. The meat in the dish was also only a small amount. 

The price is decent and portions are large but there's so many similar hakka places down the street that I wouldn't recommend this one."}
{"text":"my first and last time there....I came here for lunch and was hoping this would be just as good as Fredricks, but it didn't live up to its expectation.  Though the Chicken/ veggie pakora was good, the chili chicken was quite disappointing.  The service is friendly, the atmosphere is casual/ trendy.  The prices are reasonable, but if you're looking for mid-of-the-road hakka then this would be your place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch. They have a good selection of items. Comes with choice of soup or a can of pop. I usually get their soup. The three times I've been there, I've gotten corn soup once and hot and sour soup twice. The portion is good and food is yummy. Service is attentive as well."}
{"text":"I don't have hakka food very often but when I do, I expect it to be spicy. I came with three of my friends who have been here before and told me they died of spice so naturally, I was very intrigued.

Our server suggested we get the fish pakoras with sweet/sour sauce to start off and they were very tasty! There was plenty of fish to feed four people as an appetizer so we were happy with portions, however it was a bit pricy. We also ordered 4 meat dishes (crispy beef, garlic chicken, manchurian tofu and chef special spicy wings) and a Szechuan fried rice. 

The crispy beef wasn't very crispy and it was quite overcooked. The garlic chicken was alright, the sauce was too tomato-y though and not enough garlic. We expected it to be dry but it was super saucy. The tofu was pretty good when it was hot because it was very crisp but over time (of course) it got mushy so eat it all soon! The chef special spicy wings weren't really very spicy and the sauce was quite salty. We did order extra spicy for the manchurian tofu but for me who likes spice didn't find it spicy. 

Overall a little bit disappointed but maybe i didn't order the right dishes. I would come again to give other dishes a try!"}
{"text":"The chicken was sooooo good. Very meaty and great tasting. We had chicken 88 and the chilli chicken both were delicious and well flavoured. They were so good they made my bf cry (but he can't handle spice very well ). You get a lot for a small price. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy Hakka food & this place will satisfy those cravings but I've definitely had better. I'd say this place can be hit or miss which is why I'd give it three stars. I've been here a couple of times & usually get my staple dishes &a then try some new things on the side.

I would highly recommend the chef's shrimp, fried calamari, general tsao chicken & their noodle dishes. They never seem to disappoint & are under $10 a plate. I do have to say that the amount they give you for the shrimp, calamari, chicken or protein dishes in general isn't that much. You'd have to order at least two plates to be enough for 4 people, that is if you order a noodle or rice dish. They're good though. 

I'd stay away from the rice dishes. They normally turn out to be pure salt or pure spice. It's usually oily too. I mean it's not something you can't finish, but there are definitely better options. 

Overall, I suggest you come here with a group of people to ensure you can order various items & be content. You could get away with a $60 meal for about 5 people."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner a few days ago.

We got the fish pakora as a starter. It was very spicy for me (I can't take heat) but it wasn't spicy at all for the rest of my family. It came with a sweet sauce (perhaps plum sauce?) so the heat was bearable. The fish was very tender and everybody enjoyed this dish.

For one of our entrees, we got garlic chicken. They gave us a generous portion so there was more than enough for the four of us. It was a bit bland in my opinion but it didn't taste horrible. 

Next, we got the manchurian fish. Again, the portion was huge and the fish was very soft. I enjoyed this dish more than the garlic chicken.

Lastly, we got the sweet and sour shrimp. This was my favorite this because it wasn't spicy at all and there was a lot of sauce which was perfect for the rice. The portion wasn't as huge as the other two entrees but it wasn't unreasonably small either.

The rice costs $1.50 for a big bowl for the whole table.

Overall, this place was good. The service was great and they cleared our empty dishes very quickly. I would like to see them add some curry dishes to the menu and they'll be perfect!"}
{"text":"Decided to come eat here since I had tried their other location. Very nice and cozy restaurant. There were not a lot of people eating in the restaurant but a lot of people came in to pick up orders. My wife ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce and I had the orange beef. The shrimp and sauce were a bit salty and spicy. The orange beef did not really taste orange and it was quite crispy and dry. The portions were decent and the prices reasonable. Not sure if I will return since we were not that impressed with the food."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or a miss as far as take out is concerned. Did a take out a few weeks ago - excellent. Eat in - depends on what you order. Service - always friendly and satisfying. 

I happened to hit on the Miss today! Ordered noodles with vegetable recommended by the gentleman at the counter. The noodles were dry void of the usual sheen one gets when it's fresh and the sauce is done right. The vegetables were soft and overdone. The broccoli was stale 50% somewhat green and 50 yellow! Hence, tasted bitter. Second order was Hakka fish. Disappointing and dry. I think they do not get the batter right! The other two orders were ok. Are we going to go there again? I really don't know. But will give it another time to dine in."}
{"text":"The food portions are always great! We always order the pepper chicken, crispy beef and chili chicken! 

Can't say nothing but great things about the place... hell there staff are amazing and always double and if not... triple check if we need anything despite being busy right now"}
{"text":"This is the best hakka food place for both dining and take out. My go to is usually a chicken 88 or sweet and sour chicken. 

They have a promotion (not sure if it is temporary or always the case) but if you pay in cash for an order thats 20 dollars or more, they give you a certain percentage off your order.

Honestly bang for your buck. Food is always consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Don't go here after 9 pm. Kitchen closes early and late night orders are not about the quality. We ended up getting leftover poor quality food
."}
{"text":"The lunch special was $6.99. The food came quick, the employees were friendly, the restaurant was also decent looking.

The portions of the food were huge that I had to take it home, and boom I had dinner lol. I love it will def come back. Best hakka place that I know of."}
{"text":"I love all types of food, but lately I've been craving and wanting Indo-Chinese food like no other. This Hakka place fulfilled all those cravings. We ordered some Chicken lollipops, Chilly Chicken, Ginger Chicken and Spicy Chicken Fried Rice. Apart from the Ginger Chicken that tasted pretty bland the other dishes were good. Beware portion sizes are really large. The Staff is friendly and service was quick. I also ordered a Sweet lime and soda and it was the worst I've tasted. It was made from Ready lime juice concentrate and lacked flavor. I'd go back for the Chicken lollipops and the chilly chicken alone."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd location of China Cottage. It is in the plaza of Walmart Super Centre.

The interior is really nice, chic and modern! 4 Stars for decoation.

The services here is so attentive and friendly! 4 Stars for that!

The food, a little disappointed. The Pepper Chicken ($9.25) as appetitzer which the waiter highly recommended is a huge disappointment! It is over cooked and dry. It  is so dry that it hurt the inside of the mouth! The waiter cannot get over that we did not enjoy this....

The Shrimp Hakka Noodle Munbai Style ($8.25) is sizable. But the taste is kind of bland. For sure not spicy. It is ok, but I am not sure I will order it again.

Food 2 stars!

They do have lunch specials for $6.75 with a lot of choices that includes a pop or spring roll or daily soup.

Accepts Visa and Mastercard.

I might give China Cottage another chance in the future. But not in a rush to go and eat there again!"}
{"text":"Just go. And go hungry. The chicken 88... Hakka fish... chilli chicken with gravy... Hakka noodles... Crispy beef... enormous free bowls of steamed rice... veggie pakoras with garlic sauce... we come here regularly as a family. We wear sweat pants. We drink beers. Laughter and pigging out ensue. This staff are friendly and put up with our enormous orders. Last time we went we ordered whiskeys too - went great with that spice! The prices are not beaten in the city. This is the greatest deal for flavour and quantity/quality in the city. Superb Hakka. Must try. See you at the Cotty !!"}
{"text":"What is happening here?! I used to LOVE coming here, but the last 2 times I've been here, it wasn't great. Today I went for lunch; the service was not good and the food was .... not how it usually tastes. 

It seems like they have new waiters and all they cared about was hanging out near the back, laughing and talking. Trying to get their attention was so hard!

The water was warm.. which was gross, because we didn't ask for warm water. I got the lunch special, and got vegetable fried rice, chicken 88 and pop. The chicken 88 was good (one of my all time favourites) yet not as good as how it usually tastes. however, the vegetable fried rice was GROSS!"}
