{"text":"Excellent food, affordably priced, to go or dine in! We've frequented Indian cuisine throughout the UK, this is comparable to the best sit down restaurants.  The curries are flavorful, robust and hearty. The spices are vibrant, not what you would expect in a to go or casual dining setting.  The Naan bread is made fresh as are the Samosas. I think you can attribute the fantastic quality of the food to the owner and trained chef. Portions are right sized, we were not disappointed. I would highly recommend Twisted Curry. It's my new go to Indian Restaurant. Can't wait to try a wrap & their salads."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on the amazing wraps. My 3rd lamb boti wrap in a week...amazing! New favorite spot close to home!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food in North Scottsdale area. The concept is good for dine in and TOGO and staff and owner is very friendly. Can start some Chaat items or street food variety? So can stop in the evening to enjoy the snacks."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... flavorful curry and generous amount of rice and nan (free if you order the 2 curry combo). Overall I enjoyed the service, quality, and variation of flavor they have to offer. The only thing that's stopping me from giving them a 5 is the amount of curry they serve you. By the time I'm finish with my rice and working on the last half of the nan, I'm scraping the bottom surface of the curry bowl to get the curry on my nan. If they start filling up the small bowl up to the brim with curry, for sure I'll recommend this place to anyone who's seeking for a quick and delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"Chilli chicken is a little too sweet. Nice soft naans and the lamb curry has nice Indian delicacy."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to have fast Indian food that tastes delicious and full of flavors. There is a promotion offer that if you get 2 choices of curry, you get free naan. They bake the naan in the tandoor fresh when you order.
Btw, when you get bowl, you get side of rice or naan and salad and free cookie. :D Portions are large and food is fresh. 
It is near to Harkins theatre."}
{"text":"read the great reviews before stopping here for the first time.  Even so, the food and service exceeded expectations.  delicious food and patient employees made this a great first experience.  Even worked with our kids to find something the picky eaters liked.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Took out after the movie and was delightfully surprised by the delicious flavors and high quality of the food! Two double curries gave us a taste of four different nuanced flavors, garlic naan and perfect rice. There are many other choices, so we will be back! The fast casual restaurant is fresh and inviting. Finally a great Indian restaurant in the hood!!"}
{"text":"I order lunch to go today for the 1st time at this place.  The chipotle chicken curry and strawberry limonada tasted delicious. The place is small, very clean with friendly service.  Price is affordable Loved it."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good curries, friendly staff, and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Tried Twisted Curry for the first time today. Really great fresh Tandorri Curry. I'm glad this place is here! I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"First time - and I was very pleased.  Very clean and welcoming environment, very friendly and helpful, all smiles.  

The chicken meat in the Curry was cooked to perfection (lunch hour on a Friday) - Moist and so flavorful.  The spice level was just right and it was reasonably priced, quick and convenient.  A very healthy salad with rice served on premium paper bowls like Chipotle.  The curry comes on the side and when you order two bowls they throw in a Nan bread.  It was delicious, and you can get garlic or plain.  

I like the portion sizes as it allows me to enjoy authentic curry and Indian spices without blowing a huge hole in my calorie count.  So hard to find a healthy place to eat out without a thousand calories.  

Great concept, tasty, fast, friendly and a good value. Plan to go back often."}
{"text":"The lamb kabobs were awesome. Definitely going back to try some of the curry and other plates. Everyone in our group enjoyed their food. The prices are perfect. Zero complaints, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The best Indian I've had in a long time!! You have to try the coconut curry and tiki marlsala!! 
Everyone is so nice and amazing at letting you take samples."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch based on the good reviews it's received. It was OK, but not amazing. The customer service was great and everyone was very friendly. When I walked in, the guy at the front asked if I'd ever been there before. I told him no and began to tell me about the menu, which was nice. He let me taste whatever I wanted to check out the spice level. I ordered the chili chicken and also the tandoori chicken masala. Since I ordered to meats, it came with free naan bread. The bread was made to order! Fresh and hot. Loved it. The tandoori chicken was pretty tasty, but my only complaint was I couldn't tell if it was white meat chicken or not...it didn't taste like it, and I'm kindof a stickler on that. The chili chicken got progressively hot as I ate it. Lol. My lips and mouth were on fire by the end! But I will say, it was a tasty dish! I don't think white meat chicken is used for that one either...as others have said, portions are kinda on the small side. It automatically comes with a salad, so if you don't want it, you bowl is only half filled with rice...that may disappoint some people. I was full when I left though. I spent around 11 dollars for a 2 meat entree and a medium drink. All in all it was a decent meal if you're looking for fast food Indian."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was great. It was my first time here and they let me and my friend try as much as I wanted before I selected. Food was fresh, had great flavor, and satisfied my craving for Indian cuisine. The naan bread was out of this world good. They baked it right in front of us and served it to us fresh. Their $8 2 entree meal was a deal!"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Tasty food. Nice location next to the movies and shopping. Will be back on another movie night."}
{"text":"This place satisfies my need for curry!  I heard about TC a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to try it.  I was not disappointed.  I had the lemon grass curry, and it was delicious.  The naan was hot and tasty.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Don't be afraid to ask the staff for recommendations.  They steered me towards a very delicious lunch.  I was surprised how well things ran given that when I went they only opened about a week ago."}
{"text":"I was visiting town and I decided to stop @ twisted curry to try something different! The food was delicious and very well priced! The staff was very inviting and allowed samples of all curries. It an assembly line style (like chipotle or subway) for curry and other Indian food. If I lived in the area I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We picked up takeout from here on Monday and were pretty disappointed.  My paneer tikka masala was thin, mildly sweet and tasted like it was from a can.  Husband's aloo gobi (which is usually a saucey/soupy texture) was just cauliflower and potatoes.  They get points for making the naan fresh but it was just meh."}
{"text":"This place is good and an interesting concept. In England Indian food is a sit down, fine dining event. Here in the US is it usually a buffet with mediocre food on a steam table. Twisted Curry is a fast-food approach with fabulous results. 
We tried the lamb curry, tandoori chicken, chicken chili and a Thai chicken. All were served with rice, salad and fresh made naan bread. 
Usually when I order lamb I expect it to be fatty and hope that it isn't tough or chewy. The lamb was trimmed beautifully and cooked super tender. It was my favorite of the four entrees that we sampled. 
The tandoori chicken was also cooked nicely and the sauce was very flavorful and mild. I would defiantly order it again
The chili chicken wasn't what I was expecting but it was non the less good. I usually don't eat fried foods so that may have played a part in my  liking. 
The Thai chicken was in a nice curry sauce, again pretty tame on the heat.
The rice and the salad were very good and the freshly made naan bread was fabulous. Crunchy in the middle and soft and chewy on the edges. 
If you are an Indian food newbie the staff is eager to help walk you thru the menu and they do offer a kids menu if you have the little ones in tow.
I'm looking forward to my next visit as to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great fresh and tasty food ! They also make it in front of you . Was pleasantly surprised to find goat curry and that too done well !"}
{"text":"You got to love this place. Pretty unique way of serving Indian food.  Brings back memories for me because many places in Singapore serve it this way.  And make sure you order the naan, it comes out of a Tandoori Naan Oven fresh. And pay that extra $1.50 for the Lamb Curry.  If you are afraid of that super spicy taste, no worries its very gentle on the palate. Love the Mango Lassi as well."}
{"text":"Tried a new Indian fast food curry restaurant, friendly staff excellent variety and prices are great. We had garlic naan, tandori chicken curry, coconut curry chicken, chicken kabob with very tasty lemon vinaigrette dressing for the salad. Tasty vegetable rice. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Chicken was raw and not edible.  Girlfriend got sick.  Shame it looked so good.  When asked to send it back Cook was very upset he was called out on his cooking."}
{"text":"The best naan bread! They make in the clay oven right in front of you and it is so good. All the food is on a buffet style line and they will let you taste the sauces to make your final selections. The sauces were all very tasty and they had a veg option as well. Great lunch spot, but be careful the Yelp map is wrong this place is to the left of the movie theater."}
{"text":"The Indian 'Chipotle' is here, and I'm glad they opened up in my neighborhood. The flavors are absolutely on point. It is fresh, portions are great, location is right. The options are amazing. They even have lamb. I was confused when I got there because according to reviews this was buffet style, but it's not. This is more of a Chipotle style. You don't have to wait for food to be cooked in the back, but instead you get your pick and sit! Hastle free and fast. Today I found out that I don't eat bread... But I eat naan! This bread is prepared fresh only after you order. Service is excellent. This place is run by people whom you can see are proud of their food & craft. This food is really good. The flavors are popping. The thing about this place is forks are worthless. Go for the spoon. Their food is all about the sauces and the curries, and stews, and that is not only good by me, but makes me happy. For only $10 I got 2 meats, rice, salad, and naan... Not a bad deal at all. This place is good stuff"}
{"text":"Warren did an awesome job. He explained to me the items available and also the best sellers in appetizers. Samosa chaat is the best!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by and it was excellent! Lots of vegetarian options and fresh vegetables. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not a bad try. Good presentation but food was ok. It kind of feels like someone just came out of culinary school. I had a couple curries but they weren't really flavorful like authentic Indian food tastes. Also maybe it's just me but oldies but goodies music played with Indian food just doesn't go together."}
{"text":"I got goat curry and chilli chicken carryout. Wish they asked before putting sauce on chilli chicken. I didnot like thale sauce. Naan was goood"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Scottsdale. Quick lunches are a big plus. Lamb curry is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Food was good. I tried multiple combos and everything tasted good. Good alternative for Chipotle lovers."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner on a Thursday night at about 5 pm. The place was empty. We were helped by Sarah who was very patient with all of us as this was our first visit. She explained what they had and how it worked. We all decided on the 2 curry plate which comes with 2 Curries, plain or veggie rice, green salad and a freshly baked in front of you in a tandoori oven nan bread!

All the food was delicious, fresh tasting and everything was super clean. We had lamb curry, vegetable  korma, dal, Thai coconut  curry, and tandoori chicken curry. Everything was soooooooooo good. Nothing was a super spicy and most of what we had would be what I would call mild. I tried the goat curry and it was probably the spiciest thing they had but I did not get it. 

They have a fantastic mango lasi. Get it for sure. Not too.sweet and so creamy. They have wraps, salads and everything can be made to go. 

Service was 5/5. Thanks Sarah!  Food was 5/5. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy we found this place! So many choices beautifully presented before you, so you may choose by menu or sight. Vegetarian options. Friendly staff. We'll return soon and recommend to our friends. The two entree meal was the best choice. Two of us ordered two of those and shared everything, the way Indan food should be! Great value, as we left full and with awesome leftovers. Yep yep! Try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! A fast casual lunch spot with fresh Indian Food. I got the Tandoori Chicken and it was perfect. Loved the free side salad and order of Naan! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Good taste and Good concept but it doesnt really work!
They didn't even ask or offer all the different options. They serve small portions.
I missed the traditional Indian lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food with a ton of choices. Service is similar to fast food. Enjoyed the veg choices. Aloo gobi is excellent. Great service and prices."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a few times and finally decided to give it a try. It is phenomenal! The food is great and on top of it, the price is even better. Everyone was very friendly and the place was nice and clean. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff and owners are very friendly and the food is great. Such a cool concept I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Kind of a cool concept, chipotle-style Indian food. I was a little unsure of it but I think it works! I ended up getting the two entree meal with a side of naan bread. I got vegetable curry and paneer. I don't think they actually gave me paneer, I think they gave me vegetable curry and channa masala, but it was yummy regardless. They make the bread there which is cool! I wasn't huge on the rice, I wanted just plain basmati rice but they didn't seem to have it. Also I felt a little bad for the guy in front of me, because they forgot to help him and then when they did he had to ask like 5 times for paneer and the guy working behind the counter had no idea what he was talking about and kept trying to give him the wrong thing haha. So people working there seemed a bit clueless but they were nice and food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Last week I checked out this relatively new kid on the block!
The name of the business was somewhat unappealing but the reviews were very good. 
So no risk no reward. 
I walk in and am lost on how the delivery system works. But luckily the young lady behind the counter senses my feeling of confusion and comes to my rescue. 
I place my bet on the curry bowl with the two curry option: lamb curry (extra $1.50) and chicken. 
I get my order and realize that it comes with Naan and rice. Halleleujiah! But would have been good to know this at time of ordering. 
Quality of food: excellent!
Ambiance: very sterile; no music
Customer engagement: good but for first time customers need better communication as to how to order. 
Will I come back? Yes, because the food was good and was a great value. 
Go guys go!"}
{"text":"Good casual Indian restaurant recently opened just about a month ago and good place to come for a quick lunch dine in or to go.

Two bowls come with choice of rice and two types of curry, and a choice of nan. I tried lamb curry and spinach during my first time here and both of them were very flavorful. Garlic nan was just okay for me, I wouldn't pay extra for this.

Chai tea tasted good and nicely compliment spicy curry.

Staff was friendly and gave me an advance which side salad to pick.

Lunch was less than $10 and just right amount of serving size for me. 

Since this place is so close to my office, looking forward to coming back to try different kind of curry."}
{"text":"I will take a pass on this one. Picked up dinner there Wednesday night. I have had a lot better. Good concept, need to improve on food quality and portion size. There's a lot of good Indian places around to pick from, this place is good for a quick bite and don't expect to much. They must have a following to give it 4 stars, however I'm not one of them"}
{"text":"Visited Twisted Curry for lunch today. This fusion chipotle style Indian place is a Gem  in the valley. 

Tried their 

1)Tandoori BBQ with Chipotle chicken Kebab-Must Try 
(Juicy tender freshly made meat with Indian spices with a side of salad and Naan)

2)Curry Bowl with chicken curry (Good)and Lamb curry (Excellent)

I would recommend this place to everyone. Hope they open more branches all over the valley."}
{"text":"Savor your taste with buds with this delicious chipotle style Indian meal. This place is pretty new (been there for around 2 months), and I'm glad I checked it out.

Tried the 2 course meal with fried rice. You get Nan on the side as a bonus. Oh wait, did I say mention about the salad - Now this makes it a double bonus! Chose tandoor chicken and chipotle chicken curry as part of the 2 course meal. The chicken is extremely tender and well cooked. I just relished the feeling of tender chicken melting in my mouth. 

The staff is courteous and are more than willing to accommodate any of your requests. I can see this place getting really busy in the next few months - Perfect spot to grab a quick bite especially for folks working in the nearby offices.

I's strongly recommend it. Give it a shot!

2nd visit - Tried the coconut chicken curry this time. Go for it if you want to expand from the traditional tikka masala and try something different."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say? They have great food and great selections of curry dishes. You can't go wrong with the lamb curry bowl! The food was tasty and on top of that, since it was our first time here, they were very nice and informed us of a plethora of options! Great service and food!

J out."}
{"text":"Great place! Walked in and found that it was very easy to order. I've been to Indian restaurants a handful of times, and always feel lost figuring out what to order. Everything I tasted (yes they will give you a sample) was super tasty. I would definitely recommend getting the two scoops for the curry. One was a tad on the small side. Along w the curry bowl, I ordered a samosa chaat which came w all the toppings--yogurt sauce, mango chutney of sort, some type of slight spice, and I think another topping. Pretty tasty!  The employees were incredibly patient, and informative, and the place was clean. I would like to have been able to order iced tea or something other than soft drinks, but overall I really liked this place! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the flavorful chicken kebabs w/salad and added the Marsala fries which were tasty too. My hub liked his lamb curry, rice and chipotle chicken plus an order of samosa, he said all were spicy. I didn't care for the nan but he did.

He was able to sample and make decisions. We will surely return for another enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"The Good: Ambiance is good, Good concept, Food tastes decent. Naan tastes really good.

The bad: Teenie portions for $9, appallingly small portion on the Chicken kabab. Both of us were very hungry after the lunch.

The ugly: the cucumber salad was most probably left over from yesterday, it had gone bad.

I truly want this place to be successful, decent Indian food in Phoenix has been a unicorn so far... sigh..."}
{"text":"It's hard to find Indian food that is vegan. The chef ( also the owner) understood my dietary restrictions and suggested the right options. So as a vegan looking for Indian food options, I was happy to find they care and cater to my needs.

I have been here three times now , and I totally left satisfied and happy with the taste/quality.

I am ready to take my friends and recommend this to many more who appreciate good food."}
{"text":"This place was excellent, I'm not a big fan of Indian food but it was really good and I would go again. The only downside was my shit the next day smelled like a homeless guys anus, totally worth it though! Would go again 10/10!"}
{"text":"Was a good fusion kind of a thing in
Indian food but can't much say that 
Food was delicious . The panneer gravy
We had was flavorless but the okra Subji
Was good  . The wrap kind of thing was 
Too much over powered with mint chutney
Iam a great lover of mint ( like will eat it raw even as a side with all meals ) but I couldn't with stand the amount of mint used in the recipe . The potato chips was good  ! 
Over all was a okay kind of feel wasn't a great one though . There is this combo 
In the menu  where they give 2 gravy some
Rice and a naan with a little salad on the side that was the only one that I felt was 
Very good ! 
I mean like when we go out to have food 
I  expect the food not only to be good
But also the signature of the dish has 
To have something extraordinary going 
On that it should keep u in the loop 
Of finding what's going on in the plate trying to figure out what's  all has been there and how they pulled out  that kinda flavor profile in it ?! That experience 
I couldn't get it there . 

Over all a good place to try and see what 
U like in it"}
{"text":"Back at Twisted Curry for an Indian dinner.  I usually have the kabobs but decided to try a different meal.  I had never tried the tandoori chicken curry and ask for a sample.  It was good and spicy.  We ordered rice with tandoori chicken curry and salad along with rice, Naan, Chana masala and tandoori chicken curry.  Service was quick as these dishes are already prepared.  The dishes were both good.  The curry is fairly hot so beware if you have a sensitive palate.  I liked the tandoori chicken but still prefer the kabobs which are freshly made.  Prices are reasonable.  Plenty of parking in this large mall."}
{"text":"Twisted Curry is a great casual Indian restaurant, similar in style to Chipotle. Good food, incredible naan, and really affordable for a lot of food."}
{"text":"Arizona totally needed a place like this. Just discovered this place while attending the Phoenix Film Festival. Double whammy today. Their freshly made naan is soft, thin, fluffy - everything that a naan should be. Having lived in India I am feelin' mighty expat'ish nostalgia coming on at the moment."}
{"text":"Neat concept . Good food . 

Chipotle chicken bowl and chicken 65 are really tasty. So is the paneer wrap . Good authentic Indian flavors , the portions are neither here nor there for a proper meal . Recommend larger portions"}
{"text":"Great new Indian place that's opened up next to Hawkins cinema off Scottsdale road and 101. 
Casual environment. Staff is super friendly. We ordered the wraps, a chicken and lamb. Both were made to order and tasted amazing. 
Owner who is also the chef personally cooked the food for us. 
Wraps were perfectly spicy. Meat was extremely moist and well cooked. The side chutney is perfect accompaniment. 
They also have other traditional Indian dishes you can try. I haven't had the chance to try these yet but will do it soon. 

Would highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Delicious. The spices they use on their chicken? Amazing. I know they won't share it with me but wow am I going to try and replicate! The prices are pretty reasonable as well. I got the 2 entree dish and my friend got the Tikka burger with fries. Definitely recommend dipping the fries in the mint chutney or masala sauce! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This establishment has been open for 3 days now. It is near the Harkins 101 theater. Nice clean place. Got there for a late lunch at 1:30 this afternoon. Husband and I were the only people there. Decided to give it a try instead of going to Tealight Cafe. A variety of curries available. We decided to get the Marsala chicken curry and some other red chicken curry (little spicy for me) in a bowl. So we ended up with 2 small bowls of curry and 2 bowls of white jasmine rice with thin sliced onions. The gentleman helping us gave us naan bread (garlic & cilantro) to try with our curry (normally an extra charge) and 2 cookies (like a shortbread with almonds).  Everything was delish. I imagine this would be a good place if your lunch time was limited."}
{"text":"Delicious and quick curry and various Indian favorites.  learn how to eat Indian from the natives who come for lunch!  Fresh made naan makes the meal. yummy"}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh and fast, which is quite rare. Very reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Definitely one of my \"go to\" places for a quick meal or take out."}
{"text":"Went in to have lunch with my toddler after doing some shopping nearby. The staff was friendly and professional upon entering. I decided on the coconut sweet chile chicken and a rice bowl for my daughter. The flavor was good and even my daughter seemed to enjoy a few bites and it wasn't too spicy or overwhelming for her. I also had one of their specialty drinks, the strawberry mint lemonade, and it was very refreshing. Overall a great place for a bite to eat at a good price and good for kids!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The curries are made fresh and have the best flavor. I would suggest getting a 2 item combo because it comes with naan bread, which is divine. I am so happy to finally have an affordable and quality Indian place in the area. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"What great service and food tasted amazing. So glad to have found a new Indian joint close to home in Scottsdale great location and awesome stuff."}
{"text":"We just got into town and was wanting something close that could deliver. Unfortunately, Twisted Curry was a poor choice. They list Takeout and Delivery on this site but neither of which worked. We called and they first stated they did Grub Hub and Uber Eats but later recanted and only did Grub Hub. 

Food arrived an hour later in small little tins. Portions were pretty small but probably adequate for the cheap pricing. However I order the lemingrass coconut chicken BBQ Kabob which didn't resemble a Kabob at all. It was removed from the skewer which turned everything into a pile of mush. The chicken was good,not great, but the peppers were really spicy overpowering the chicken flavor. The so called salad was a child sized handful of lettuce, no dressing or anything. I've had more lettuce on a burger.

My better half, being Indian, had the eggplant curry bowl and said it was the worst Indian food she had ever had. It didn't taste or resemble anything recognizable as Indian cuisine. 

How this place has 4.5 star rating is beyond my comprehension."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect.  The food is so fresh and you can try samples before you order. The people are wonderful, friendly and eager to please. The food is delicious and plentiful.  I could barely finish my meal.  The atmosphere is simple and clean and bright and spacious.  So cool that they make the naan right in front of you in the special oven.  The unlimited chai tea is a perfect addition to this perfect meal.  It's quick, friendly, clean, fresh, cheap and delicious.  What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food.  Perfect before a movie.  Great, friendly service.  Very helpful, courteous staff.  Nan is delicious."}
{"text":"This is like the Chipotle of Indian food. I got the one entree lamb curry (I would recommend adding extra cilantro) and a lemonade strawberry mint. The rice they use has a cinnamon scent and is soft to eat. The lamb curry is very tender and moist, almost falls apart the moment you stab your fork into it. 
I would recommend going here, either to hang out with friends or to enjoy a nice filling meal."}
{"text":"A tasty Indian \"buffet\"  They serve and you pick sauces and protien. Used to putting together myself, but food was good. Would go again if in the area"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The executive chef here is so nice and friendly! I went with coworkers and he was the last person in the line to give us our salads. When we finished our meals he came up to our table and gave us cookies and we let him know how much we love the food.  I got the tandoori chicken and the coconut sweet chilli chicken. Delicious!!! It comes with basmati rice and naan. Y E S!!! I would absolutely come back.

The only thing I would say needs improvement is the smoke indoors. It's an open cooking space, so the vent is not strong enough to engulf and redirect the smoke from the food being cooked. So, the smoke just kind of hangs out inside. Other than this, this place is ah-ma-zing!!!"}
{"text":"What a great concept! This is a Quick Serve Indian restaurant much like the line at Chipotle. You choose your rice and your curries and they provide salad and garnishes and naan. Samples are readily available, and the several that I tasted were all delicious. On a Saturday for lunch, they were only a little busy. The counter service gal gave us a couple of samples and then took the order of the couple behind us and proceeded to serve them even though we were ready to order. She seems confused that Mom and I were together, she took my tray to the cash register and rang me up and I said well we're together you're going to have to serve her in order to ring us both up and she did not seem to understand. The Tandoori chicken sauce was amazing, the lamb was very tender but the sauce was so salty that we could not eat it. I did bring this to the attention of the owner. I think this store has a lot of potential once the employees are trained, because the recipes are delicious. I will have to sample a few more on my next visit!.  I noted that there really isn't anywhere to place your tray while paying for your order, this may present a problem. The condiment station is very small and not located conveniently for this purpose.  If they are busy, you won't have the luxury of taking  your tray to a table first."}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is outstanding. Nothing elaborate and reasonably priced. Fast casual Indian served in an easy manner. We had the fabulous berry salad and had meat and chicken on top. Sat outside and enjoyed the experience immensely. The owner is very accommodating. A surprising delight."}
{"text":"This is a great \"fast food\" Indian restaurant. It is buffet style and you can choose your entres and rice. They do not make anything to order which lowers the quality quite a bit. I personally like Indian food to be very spicy and because it is buffet style, thats not really possible. It did however satisfy my craving for Indian cuisine without making a huge dent in my wallet. It seems like Indian cuisine is getting more and more popular in the Phoenix area. At a sit down restaurant it normally takes quite a while because they make it to order and it can be quite costly. This new take on \"fast food\" was impressive. The service was also exceptional. I wouldn't rate this my number one go to for Indian food in the valley but I'll probably stop there for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"This is a great to go or dine in fast food style Indian food place. The selections are varied with great flavor. They have kebabs and Curry bowls and wraps as well as salads. Prices are very reasonable. Staff is extremely friendly. High on my go to List."}
{"text":"Loved Twisted Curry!  Authentic restaurant style dishes with fast food service.  The naan is the real deal. Lamb curry was rich and spicy. For the price you can't beat it. Husband had the goat curry and tandoori chicken curry. Both were delicious. We were stuffed but had to try to the samosas and they didn't disappoint. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother as this place serves tiny portions of food - very little curried meat for the price. My order came to $ 10.84 with a soda. Again, tiny portions of lemongrass chili chicken. The staff is reported as friendly in other reviews but I did not find them particularly friendly on my first visit. The Naan flatbread was kind of soggy. I had high hopes for this place and while the food was good, it is clearly overpriced for the amount of food that you receive."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the place is really clean. After having Indian food all over the valley this place is truly different....and in a very good way! Well done to the people behind the concept!"}
{"text":"Delicious, flavorful, quick, easy and affordable! Staff is friendly and owners are working on-site and clearly care about your experience. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So happy this place is open. Came in for dinner tonight. The food was delicious and the customer service was amazing! We are looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Twisted Curry is great for a quick Indian-ish lunch. They must have about ten different types of curries, which you can get with rice and salad or wrapped up into a delicious curry wrap. I tried a two curry combo: I got the dal and fish curry with rice and salad. The fish curry was a tad salty but it went well with the rice. They also give you naan so it is a pretty good deal. I'll be back for future lunches."}
{"text":"Delicious food & fantastic atmosphere! I'm fairly picky when it comes to Indian, but this place was delicious! The setup was unique compared to traditional Indian restaurants as it was more of a cafeteria style serving. The portions were generous and the service was amazing! The executive chef even hand delivered delicious cookies to our table. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had couple of orders Togo. It's conveniently located next to Harkins theater. It's quick and inexpensive.

Chicken & lamb curry, and lamb kebab was just ok, nothing special. The salad that it came with was fresh and had nice crunch. 

The Naan bread we ordered (garlic flavor & plain) came little soggy as the sauce from meat dish spilled in the bag. I love Naan bread and had high hopes as they make them fresh in house. I was very disappointed though. It maybe due to being wet but it had no taste and no chewiness to it at all. I'm sure it would've tasted better if we had eaten it there. I really wanted to like it here, but I'm sorry I didn't."}
{"text":"I would've given this a 4 or 5 star review because the food was yummy but after I saw the worker drop a take out lid on the floor and place it on the ones to be used it questioned my cleanliness thoughts on the entire place. How can someone in the food handling business not know that you don't do that?????"}
{"text":"Portions are small here, especially for the price.  What's odd is that this restaurant concept exists at all (at least for lunch).  There is already a norm for lunch Indian cuisine being fast as they tend to be buffet set ups, however you get an all you can eat experience for about the same price.  And, traditional Indian places are serving real Naan and not a modified, small Naan such as what they gave me at Twised Curry (mine was not like those in some of the pictures).  Buffets tend to have more choices as well.  I can't see why anyone who is a regular consumer would want to go here, other than location."}
{"text":"What's not to like - good, quick food close to the gym, and a welcoming staff.  They just opened 2 weeks ago so I don't think word has gotten out yet- but it will. Twisted Curry has a fresh, modern decor that is clean and bright. They greeted us immediately and were very helpful with our orders,  offering samples and advice on the spiciness of the dishes. I chose the curry bowl with the chicken chili which was very pleasant and the Coconut-Sweet Chili Chicken which was scrumptious. The naan was wonderfully warm and tasty. Next time I will try the kabobs which they make to order.  Two of us ate for just under $20, and we have left overs for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant in the area of the 101 Theatres.

Had the Two Entree s Bowl with Lamb Curry and Coconut Sweet Chilli Chicken with Veg Fried Rice also with Garlic Naan Bread.

Enjoyed both currys while not extremely spicy hot, just a little kick which was good for us.

Portions do not look large but is filling with the rice and naan.

Seemed fairly new with not many people in the restaurant but was nice as we came within the last hour before they closed.

I would like to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Finally a good fast Indian restaurant in North Scottsdale! I have people here at my work who now go to Twisted Curry twice a week and crave it. I liked it, didn't love it. The chicken masala lacked flavor, think spices and salt. The crunchy chicken was delicious, it's sauce was just right, a little sweet and spicy. My only complaint is that the quality of the chicken is okay, I came across a few fatty bites and that is the main reason I am giving Twisted Curry 3 stars. Meat quality counts and is important. I will go back here as it is close and was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere to get some good Indian food . I was convinced I didn't like Indian food but willing to give this place a shot . We absolutely love this place .... the spices and flavors of everything are so good . The Naan bread is made fresh when you order , salad is fresh and the mint strawberry lemonade is really good ! We live 40 minutes away but it's definitely worth the drive !"}
