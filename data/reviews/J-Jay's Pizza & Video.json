{"text":"J-Jay's has great pizza! I've never had a bad pizza from Jay, they're always excellent. Great taste, great price, great deal.  If you haven't had it yet, you seriously need to try it ASAP! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"not so nice looking from the outside. My husband and I ordered a pizza and they told us it will be 25 minutes and when we went to pick it up he said it will be another 25 min. I said why he said he is the only one working there and had to run out for a fire call at VFD of Hermine. I support that and all but not when it involves my FOOD and money and most of all TIME that I do not have."}
{"text":"My parents have been ordering J-Jay's pizza for over 20 years. If a local pizza place is in business for that long... It must be good and it is!!!"}
