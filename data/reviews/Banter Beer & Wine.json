{"text":"Wasn't sure what this place was all about after stepping out of our Uber and looking inside. Very bright, not a lot of room, and pretty bare-bones in regards to asthetics. Once inside we headed over to the food counter and chatted with the two guys working. Both were really friendly and helpful in regards to the food menu as well as the draught list. We ordered Vladamir Poutine and Polish Boy, along with a couple Black IPA. The food was really good. The flavor of the house made sausage was really excellent, nice presentation and high quality ingredients. The poutine was also very good, although I found the stroganov to be a little bland. Nice beer selection, and the glass of Cab that I had was a big one I've never tried before, lots a black currant and berries in the palate. Seems like a cool place to go and just hang out with a couple friends."}
{"text":"The staff is cool but still welcoming. More than happy to a accommodate and explain the concept. Which the concept is baller. Poutine and a six pack I'm a happy person. Solid albeit esoteric selection on draft it's fun. Just give me a well done bock with some poutine!"}
{"text":"My party just got into town this past Friday night and were looking for something for dinner. We saw this place on some best of Cleveland list and decided to check it out. It's in a super cool part of town and very industrial. It has different varieties of poutine. After tasting the different varieties that different members of my party ordered, I gotta say there's no bad choice on the menu. It's also a beer store and it has one of the most diverse selections of cider I've ever seen. If you're ever in Cleveland, this is a hard yes."}
{"text":"Suggestion: Cut back on the salt just a little. I was wondering if you salt the gravy and fries separately? 

If you cut back on the salt the food would be outstanding!  


Very salty Poutine the gravy was little watery and the furniture is not comfortable. Overall the taste of food was okay.  

There was confusion over the order but fine it is a new restaurant.  The workers hare nice and helpful. I will give it another shot.  It has potential to be five stars. I suggest giving it a try to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Local, friendly, good food, plenty of alcohol, clean bathroom, and fairly priced.

Whoever thought that connecting a well-rounded alcohol store with a restaurant who sells sausages and poutine (the owners, obviously), is BRILLIANT. I've eaten the Chicken Paprikash Poutine (a close second to my own family recipe), the Pogo, and the Vladimir Poutine. I ordered it for the name, but I keep ordering it because the lamb is tender, flavorful, and every bite is a religious experience. You can order plain jane poutine, regular old fries, a freaking CORN DOG if that tickles your fancy... There are so many options and the service is perfection. \"Is this your first time? Let me tell you about... Hi!... Welcome!...\" etc. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Go try it!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. great atmosphere, top notch beer selection and the poutine is delicious! Banter has quickly become part of the rotation - the casual vibe is welcoming, staff is super friendly and service is great. i'm a vegetarian and my husband is a meat-eating bottomless pit & we both love to throw back a few craft beers with our dinner. we typically have a hard time finding restaurants that have something on the menu for both of us & that also offer great beers to choose from, but both of us leave Banter completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Try this place!! We went on a weekday for lunch the day after we got back from a boozy vacay.... needless to say that this was the perfect way to ease back into the real world! The food was amazing and it was so hard to choose from all the options on the menu. I had the Fried Chicken Sausage & my boyfriend had the polish boy, we split the banter disco poutine. Sorry, I ate it so fast that I didn't snap any pics :) Just take my word for it and try it!"}
{"text":"Went to Banter for lunch today and had the Cleveland with a cold beer.  I really enjoyed the sandwich, which had a great blend of tastes.  The sausage on the Cleveland was awesome.  This was my first trip here and I will back."}
{"text":"Really great little place.  I had the Breakfast sausage, and I rank it as the best thing I've eaten in Cleveland.  The Rabbit Poutine was really good as well. The Poutine serving sizes could be cut back by a third to be more suitable for one person though, my girlfriend and I had a hard time finishing one order between the two of us.  Overall great place, we will return!"}
{"text":"First visit and a carryout order. We ordered the chicken pop. poutine and the sloppy joe poutine. Both dishes were unique and tasted great. I was able to walk the place and was surprised how large it is. The interior is divided up into three rooms, which would provide an opportunity to find a nook for your group or you can hang out at the bar. Modern feel. Fresh cut fries for the poutine and homemade sausage. Interesting concept of to go pricing on beverages and a corkage fee if staying. Cool place in a trending neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique sausage and poutine options.  I had the currywurst which had a very refreshing take on the sauce.  Speed of service was quite good as well.  Beer prices were a tad high but overall a very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Banter is fabulous and I truly appreciate their vegetarian options!  

My husband and I went right after Banter opened and we enjoyed ourselves. I ordered the vegetable poutine and the gravy was a bit too salty, but I still enjoyed it enough to return.  I do not recall what my husband ordered, but he too wishes to return to Banter!

I recently returned w a friend to try my hand at the Black Bean Brat.  The gravy on the vegetable poutine has been adjusted and was not as salty as my first visit.  It was SO. GOOD.  And the sausage?  It was delicious.  It is definitely a fork and knife sandwich.  My friend got the Fried Chicken Sausage and that thing is gorgeous.  She quite enjoyed her meal AND she loved the vegetable poutine, so omnivores and herbivores can share!  ...and I do advocate sharing if you want to have sausage AND poutine.  I can easily take down a sausage and an order of poutine on my own, but I will require a clear schedule, elastic-wasted pants, and plenty of recovery time if I do decide to go that route.  A sausage and sharing poutine with a friend is more than enough to leave satisfied.

I recommend and will definitely be back to Banter!"}
{"text":"Thinking about this restaurant is making me hungry right now (probably not good that I am writing this right before lunch). I went here with the Yelp May Supper Club. I was a little hesitant at first because Gordon Square is on the rise, and it's on the edge of it, but it's not hard to find parking close to the door. I really liked the ability to get up, walk around and choose your own alcoholic beverage (wine and beer mostly), single serve. You can also buy a bottle of wine, or they do have some single serves of it as well. My boyfriend went with me, and we ended splitting the Polish Boy sausage and the Heritage Pork. It was the perfect amount of food for us to split, and both were so delicious. The service was great, especially considering there were about 20 of us, all with separate checks. Hats off to our waitress. I can't wait to go back and try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the simplicity of this restaurant. You can either order Poutine or Sausage and drink either beer or wine. While it's a no frills type of place the drink options are great and the food is delicious. The service is friendly and they explain how their concept works. 

I ordered the Rabbit Pot Pie Poutine which I thought was fabulous! The poutine is enough to share so remember this when you realize you want to order everything on the menu. I also had two different bottled beers while I was dining. Regular sized cans and bottles have a $1.50 drinking fee which is just fine because anything in the coolers/ on the shelves are retail price. With the $1.50 fee my beers were still both under $4. 

I really like the easy going vibe and can't wait to come back in and indulge in their offering of canned wine!! I am very intrigued!"}
{"text":"Oh wow.  Just Wow.  Amazing sausages with wonderful flavors and interesting combinations.  And the fries in the poutine are superb - crispy with amazing potato flavor and none of the leaden greasy taste that typically get with fries.

Prompt waitstaff and a selection of retail beers/cider with a corkage fee if you drink it on site.  

I've been twice this spring and I'm already plotting my next stop!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot with a hip vibe!  Recently made our way here (for the first time) and we sat on the back patio with our friends.  Decided to get an appetizer, then share a couple of dishes while sampling their brew options.

I chose a stout beer and we settled in to wait for our cheese curds, which the server told us was a MUST.  He was right.  The cheese curds were pillowy on the inside, crunchy on the outside and served with an amazing / zesty marinara dipping sauce.  Not your typical cheese curd, but something much more special altogether.

Our \"standard\" Banter poutine (why not start with the basics, right?!?!?) was perfectly balanced with crispy (but soft inside) thick fries, hearty brown gravy and generously sized cheese curds.  So rich, so decadent, so filling!  We also took a bite of our friend's Banter Disco poutine with sloppy joe, cheddar and yellow mustard...very much like a chili cheese version and also quite delicious.

The porcini bratwurst was an unusual mix of flavors (with grated cheese and wild mushrooms) but it was quite tasty.  Looking forward to trying other varieties at our next visit...and the WILL be a next visit!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Banter a try this evening . The place itself is super key and as another reviewer stated, minimalist. Service was great, but I was a bit confused as to how to order- do is sit down? Seat myself? Order at the register...? Help. That was ironed out quick and we decided to order at the register and then seat ourselves. 
Naturally, we needed to try the poutine and decided on the Vladimir Poutine and the Banter . Both good but the fries were over cooked. We also ordered the polish boys and they were very good, as was the Corn dog. Yum! Cheese curds were also fantastic and we basically inhaled them. 
Admittedly, smitten with the alcohol selection and was so happy to select some of my favorite platform beers.  . They also have a great selection of beers on tap and my husband was very happy with his IPA.
Overall, the experience was very good and we left happy."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! This place is amazing! If you've never had poutine you have to come here, home made fries, gravy and cheese curds, yummy! 

The sausage is delicious, snappy and juicy. Great craft beer! If wines your thing, they have it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and unique food. Great spot to just relax and unwind. Had a couple soccer games on tv and even the patrons were cool. Food was served quickly and it had a uniquely Cleveland vibe. I would definitely go here again. Once neighborhood catches up, this will be an easy 5*."}
{"text":"Great food. I forget the name but the \"original\" or base poutine is really good. Each time we've been there everyone's liked their meal. Just be ready to be filled up as each meal is very filling. Beer selection is good and there's tons of beer and wine to go as well."}
{"text":"I'll be honest...the only time I ever heard of a cheese curd was in the Little Miss Muffet rhyme. Thank goodness Banter came up next on our supper club list! I'd heard of Banter and that it was a smaller place with a very chill vibe and delicious food. The place lived up to the hype! 

I wouldn't consider eating at Banter unless you're saying \"F it\" to your diet that day...holy cheese curds! We ordered the fried cheese curds with homemade ketchup (marinara? I'm actually not sure what it was ) appetizer and WOW. It's like a mozzarella sticks that was elevated to the next level, lightly fried and covered in a seasoned flakey salt. Delicious. As our entrees, my friend and I opted to share two different poutine dishes. She got the Thanksgiving dinner poutine (fries, cheese curds, turkey and gravy, stuffing, cranberry sauce) and I got the chicken paprikash poutine (fries, cheese curds, spaetzle, chicken paprikash and like a sour cream drizzle). Both very tasty but I loved the Thanksgiving dinner dish. I think it was the turkey gravy that really hit it home. 

The space is on the smaller side but it's cozy. There's a small bar and you can go into the retail shop next door and buy beer/wine to bring over to enjoy. 

Overall I liked Banter a lot but it's not somewhere I could go to eat that often...my pants would never fit!!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure my goal in life is to try every poutine on the menu. So far I've have the Vladimir, Banter, and Stroganoff and I can honestly say they get better each time. It's the best late night snack to get! Although the stroganoff was my favorite, the cheese wasn't melted all the way, but still can't complain since they were about to close and they were kind enough to let us in. The place is small and cute inside and our waitress was very friendly. Definitely plan on coming back when I have my late night munchies."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this little place.  It was worth driving out of the way for it- though it was a bit of a guilty pleasure.  We ordered some of the delicious poutine, some vegetable dish and a braut and frankly, it was a while ago and I forgot exactly what I ordered, but I do remember that I loved it.  Felt a little food-coma like afterwards, but really what do you expect if you are eating fried cheese, french fries, drinking a hard soda and pounding meat?  It was a fun time and I'll go back if I'm in the neighborhood.  Would be great if they opened up another branch in the South Cleveland area."}
{"text":"If you only order one thing get the corn dog if you and your friends are ordering everything on the menu don't forget the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Alittle piece of Canada in Cleveland! Gotta say the poutine was spot on! Whoever opened this place did his research. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love love love Banter! Just went to Montreal (poutineries galore) and we were definitely more impressed with Banter's poutines than the ones we tried on our trip. 

Banter has a very creative menu, as well as a wide selection of beer and wine. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch since we just opened an Ohio City office and have been trying out all the new places.  I love poutine and have been all over Canada from Halifax to Ottawa, from Toronto to Thunder Bay and make it a point to eat it each time I go.  I had the Heritage Poutine which has braised Berkshire pork shoulder, thin sliced jalapeno, herb salad, cheese curd and gravy. It was excellent. Perhaps the best I've had, and a huge portion. I will definitely get it again and be back to try other items on the menu.  They also have a really nice selection of beer, I bought some to take home.  Only gripe is I wish they (and most new places for that matter) would spend some money on comfortable seating.  The stools are a pain in the ass (literally)."}
{"text":"This is one of my happy places and a favorite to take out-of-towners. I feel they show the heart of Cleveland and what our food scene is all about. Casual and lowkey vibe makes it great for hanging out, trying some great beers or drinks (including local selections), and enjoying serious comfort food. Never had a poutine here that I didn't like, and everyone I have brought here has loved it and sworn they will be back."}
{"text":"I could Banter on forever about how good this place. Super cool urban vibe, simple white washed. And gritty, flavorful delicious food.  So excited to have this super cool place in Cleveland. The breakfast sausage with egg and french toast was ridiculous but so was everything we ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to restaurants that sold alcohol, but never a place that sold wine and beers and had a restaurant inside it.

Enter; Banter. 

The place is deceptive, The eating area is small strip of the place, which rooms adjacent where you can buy beer and wine selections, for on site consumption or take away. The food is really nicely done; smaller plates with delectable snacky foods that are perfect companions to their vast variety or beers and wines, or just tasty all on their own. 

Parking is a tad sparse, as there are street locations with meter, or a lot or two a short jog up the road, but it's worth the walk. Their beer and wine variety is quite large, with interesting vintages from all over. In the better-weather months, there's also a back deck to enjoy the sun and company. 

Overall, if you need a place to drink, eat, and discuss, what better spot than Banter:)"}
{"text":"I loved this menu and everything I got to try was so delicious. I love any place where I can find poutine, but a place where I can find 10 varieties of poutine?!? I was in heaven. I got the sloppy joe poutine, even better reheated. It was very good but definitely will try another next time because there was so much i wanted to eat. The classic Polish dog was so yummy, with the fried and coleslaw. A bbq sauce on there added some needed sweetness. This dish reheated very well in the toaster oven.
If you like breakfast at all, the breakfast dog with bacon, egg, blueberry sauce was amazing. Great anytime of day. 
They have a great beer and wine shop connected. Made a mix and match 6 pack which you can crack there or they have a good draft selection. Miller High Life on draft for the win. Good for trying Cleveland and other Ohio beers.
This will be a required stop for me anytime I'm in Cleveland now!!"}
{"text":"I have always been a poutine fan so I tried not to get too excited before I visited because I didn't want to set it up for unrealistic expectations.  But...this whole place is awesome!  I went with the Heritage pork poutine (slightly spicy) and got to sample from those at my table the rabbit pot pie and the chicken paprikash poutines.  All of them are freakin' fantastic.  For those watching your sodium level you can ask for your fries without salt.  And the beer selection (and I assume wine since I don't drink that) was huge.  They have a room full of glass refrigerators holding their bottled and canned selection and you get to peruse and pick your own.  I came in with a party of 18 and our server was on top of it.  I was impressed by everything."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very chill , not too loud, and offers a large selection of beers .  The food menu is interesting - lots of fries and sausage .  We ordered the polish boy , a second sausage (it had marinara sauce on it ) and the broccoli salad .  The food was ok and presentation was ok.  Overall we were not impressed . The polish boy was by far the best tasting item we ordered.  But the polish boy had too many contrasting flavors.   the coleslaw on the Po boy was not a creamy slaw :(  and there were too many spices in the slaw ... The other sausage, \"porcini\" sausage or something like that, was not tasty at all .  Again, too many spices and the flavors did not blend well . The final item ordered was the broccoli salad .  Not sure if this is a pickled salad or if the broccoli was over cooked or originally frozen .  Kind of tasted like frozen broccoli, brought to room temperature with Italian dressing dumped on it .  

Might go back to try the poutine but will not reorder the sandwiches nor broccoli."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. Vegetarian and vegan options, including poutine, salad and sausage. A hip and fun vibe. Friendly staff. Definitely one of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon. Staff was very friendly, and the bottle beer selection was terrific. The middle wine room area still feels like a work in progress. Poutines ranged from $5 (just fries) to about $20 (foie gras and duck confit). Most were in the $8-13 range. We tried the Pogo and Farm poutines, which were very good. While I don't agree with Bill's 1-star rating, the poutines were a bit salty for my tastes. Maybe a small recipe adjustment?

5-stars for a neat concept, friendly people, and great beer. I hope this place is a success."}
{"text":"This place is super fun and really casual. It felt homey. My group tried the breakfast, duck, Cleveland, and Polish sausages. The flavor a were great. Each had condiments/toppings to accent the meats. My only critique is that the buns seem too big for the sausage. It would be better smaller or with more toppings. The poutine swerve awesome! I thought the gravies had a solid and savory flavor. The French fries were perfectly cooked--soft on the inside, crisp on the outside. We tried the rabbit stew, banter, and foie gras poutines. The rabbit stew was delicious with peas and carrots. The foie was soft and fatty, perfectly accenting the crispier fries on the edge of the pan. The only other critique I have is that the beers were kind of expensive, but not that huge of a difference from other Gordon Square bars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is so Cleveland! It's a beer/wine store offering local, classic meals each with a unique and tasty spin. Their specialties are sausages and poutine, and yes you need to get both! (However it's enough to split between two people.)

I had the Breakfast Sausage (Ohio maple and sorghum bratwurst, pain perdu, blueberry mustard, bourbon bacon, fried egg and shaved maple.) AMAZING. I also had a taste of the Polish Boy Sausage (kielbasa, fries, Comeback City BBQ and coleslaw.) Also very, very good. Then we split the Farm Poutine (fried pork pate, sunnyside farm egg, neon relish, curd and gravy), which was also tasty, but I'm looking forward to trying their other types of poutine as well.

Our waiters were very friendly and knowledgeable, but weren't extra attentive. Despite that, I definitely will be back! It's such a great, casual place to enjoy great food and try some new drinks."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. What a nice little gem in Gorden Square. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. They have a large selection of wine and craft beers. You can tell the menu is chef driven evrything is well thought out and executed perfectly. We tried the fried chicken dog, the black bean dog, the breakfast dog. We also tried the rabbit pot pie poutine everything was outstanding. Will definitely return, there are more menu items that we need to try."}
{"text":"I love when a new restaurant drives me to try a new food experience. Of course I've heard of Poutine and probably had a marginal quality version at some point, but this place raises the food to a new level. We've all also had sausage, but Banter forces you to rethink this yeoman's staple. 

Loved the Duck Poutine. Loved the Cleveland sausage. Loved the eclectic pulls of draft ( this food demands draft beer!) Loved the laid back folks that run the place.

This is hearty food. Bring your meat-eating beer-drinking friends that enjoy quality. I can't imagine you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being so close to Canada, poutine is a must. In my opinion, Banter Beer and Wine does it best. Parking is located on the street, and there is no off street parking that I am aware of for the restaurant. Parking is not metered, so you don't have to worry about carrying around a bag of change. 

Once inside, you are able to sit at the counter/bar or pick a high top table. The chairs are not the most comfortable, but the great beer selection will help you quickly forget that part. They have several beers on tap including the occasional sour beer. If there isn't anything that looks good behind the bar, fear not. Walk around the corner and there are two rooms with coolers filled with nothing but beer and wine. You can pick your poison and enjoy it right there while you dine of some delicious food. 

The poutine here is incredible, great frites with gravy and plenty of melted cheese. While you at it, you have to try the cheese curds. I am not joking when I say that they are the best cheese curds you will ever taste. I paid a compliment to the cook, and he said they are made with Colt 45 in the batter, and that anything made with Colt 45 is delicious. I have to agree with him, they are beyond incredible. Four Stars"}
{"text":"Vegetarians can enjoy a vegetable poutine, Brussels sprouts salad, or fried cheese curds. Vegans can do first two items without cheese. Ask no questions about the fryer. Honestly, though, vegetarian poutine without the cheese curds is basically wet fries -- good fries with good veggie version of gravy, but next time we will try the plain frites. $36 for two glasses of wine and split of veggie poutine and shaved Brussels sprouts salad. 

We enjoyed the first two items and walked next door to Local West for delicious Very Vegan sandwich. Like the friendly neighborhood vibe of Banter but not a place where we are able to grab dinner sadly (at least, not yet). Fingers crossed for vegan options -- and server indicates a veggie sausage is in the works. Yes, please."}
{"text":"I love Banter. I went for the first time two weeks ago and I already brought more friends back to check the place out.  The restaurant has a clean and modern feel, but the food is anything but. I had no idea what to expect, so I tried the Banter Poutine to start. Out comes a giant tray of some of the most delicious fries, gravy and cheese curds I have ever had.  It was exactly what I needed.  The portions are fantastic. The second time I went, I enjoyed Vladimir Poutine which was just as good as the classic dish. The beer list is really great, too. Banter also has an extensive beer and wine list available for carryout, as well as a full liquor bar. Both of the servers I had were friendly and knowledgeable. I will certainly be going back to Banter at least a few more times this winter."}
{"text":"They were really unprofessional. I came to pick up my food and the clerk was incredibly rude when my order was incomplete. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My draft beer was fine. If you want a good hotdog, head east a couple of blocks and go to Happy Dog. Banter's dog was bland on all fronts. The poutine was confusing, with no unique, identifiable flavors. Lastly, my to-go order took over 15 min to come out when nothing needed to be cooked longer than it takes to drop fries in grease."}
{"text":"Love the poutine concept-- Banter is an awesome casual & fun little joint. Their drink selection is out of this world- they have beer on tap and an entire back room dedicated to different beer & wine (all refrigerated.) You can either drink it there or take it to go. There is a poutine selection for anyone and they have gluten free/ vegetarian options. Some are intensely creative white others are more simple. The brussel sprout salad is delicious if you don't want to totally get bogged down with gravy & cheese. The only suggestion I can think of is to melt the cheese curds a little more, ours were a cold and chewy. Street parking. Will be back ;)"}
{"text":"Banter is the new kid on block in Gordan Square. Love the location and style of the restaurant. The bartenders are very young which makes this place feel like a college bar. The idea of the restaurant is great, but I won't go into that, it's part of your servers spiel. Food was wonderful. Try the disco and the Cleveland sausage, could not stop eating. My only reason for the 4 starts is the steep beer prices. $8 for draft? Yallllll."}
{"text":"this place is literally down the street from me so i'm pretty excited about it opening. my vegetarian self went with my nonvegetarian friends. i like the spot. there's not much for decorations and they're still in the process of making the space their own but the guys and girls working there are super friendly.
vegetarian poutine was certainly very tasty, and filling, but i'm not sure that i should be having this as dinner. my nonvegetarian friends enjoyed their meals.
looking forward to the veggie sausage option coming (the smoked apple sage sausage from field roast is delicious if you're looking for options! or would love to try your homemade recipe :D)
also, we did keep falling out of the stools because they're super slippery. not sure about the furniture choices lol"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge poutine or sausage fan but I went here for the supper club event. The poutine lovers say the poutine was delicious. I split the hot dog and corn dog, probably not the way to go with either. Small meat and corn dog was over cooked. However, the cheese curds were phenomenal!! Would def stop in for cheese curds and beer again maybe not dinner. 

Very cool idea with the alcohol. Like how it's grocery store style to pick it out and then opened at the table, and the selection is great, they will offer suggestions if you ask. Fun place to have an event, we enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"An awesome selection of beer and wine, mostly small or craft breweries but some crowd favorites as well. They also have a case of small label pop with great flavors I haven't found at any other restaurant. We tried the classic poutine, the polish boy, and the corn dog; the sausages are very good, and the gravy on the poutine has a deep flavor that sets off the dish nicely. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. I wish they had some seating that wasn't bar height, but overall this was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Really chill spot, I have a new pit stop place for sure along the way from Chicago to new york. Definitely try their Cleveland sausage and sixpoint hi-res ipa, delicious. The service is great too. Parking is available when you turn into 74th st, and then its an immediate left after their restaurant. Don't back in the back of the restaurant because that's for some apartment tenants.

For the beer fans, check out the coolers on the way to the bathroom.... Its amazing!"}
{"text":"The concept is a simple, yet brilliant one. 10 different poutine dishes, 10 different sausage dishes and a carefully curated craft beer and wine selection. Everything's made fresh, in-house, with locally sourced ingredients. On paper there's really no way this couldn't be a good thing. In person it's an even better thing. First off, for the uninitiated, let's get a little bit of education out of the way.

Poutine (n) - A Canadian dish, originating in the province of Quebec, made with French fries and cheese curds topped with a light brown gravy.

I know, right? Fries, cheese and gravy. It's speaking directly to my soul. But I'm a simple man, I admit. It's about time someone specialized in this gut bustingly delicious ethnic culinary creation. That's really the main draw for me. I've had poutine at several establishments in our fair city and they always fall just a bit short. The curds aren't right, the fries are soggy, the gravy tastes like it's out of a jar. With most poutine-esque dishes there's no personality. Not so the case with the poutine at Banter.

There's a bit of a learning curve here. It's not huge, but you may benefit from a little Banter 101:

Enter through the front door. You can eat inside at one of the tables or at the 10-seat bar. Walk toward the back and as soon as you see the kitchen on the left make a right. That's where the adult beverage lair is located. Wine bottles, coolers filled with packaged beer and wine. Grab what you want and take it to your table.

They charge retail price for the beer and wine and if you drink it there - and you will drink it there - they'll add on a service fee to the price. I believe it was about $2 for beer and I don't drink wine so I don't know or care what it was for wine.

They have a patio and it's pretty awesome. Beautifully decorated and landscaped, it's a cute little oasis that's right behind the main building. Be forewarned - the parking spaces back by the patio are for the residents of the apartments in the buildings around it, Don't park there. Park on the street out front or down the side street.

So, what about the beer? The craft beer selection is not huge but it's thoughtfully stocked. You'll find locals, regionals and internationals. You can buy large format bottles for sharing (or not) and your standard 12-oz bottles. They've also got a really great 10-tap draught list that features some very unique beers you probably won't find anywhere else around town. During my visit I had Founder's Sumatra Brown (imperial brown ale with Sumatra coffee) and a saison brewed with honey and apricots called Bee Squad from Goose Island. Trust me. If I have no complaints in this department, chances are you won't either.

The food. Yeah, this is some seriously delicious grub. It's fatty, it's salty, it's crispy, it's creamy, it's cheesy, it's meaty and it's fucking awesome. I'd eat here every day if I could and I'd die at 50 of a massive heart attack with a stupid smile on my face. Do like we did and get several things for sharing. There are too many things not to. On the sausage front you can eat at least half a dozen different animals at this place. We had the Ohio venison mortadella. The apple fennel slaw and the gentle gaminess of the meat were a match made in heaven. And the bun it was served in, from an Akron-area bakery, was soft and doughy and beautiful to behold.

Because we needed the illusion of eating something that was good for us, the Banter Salad. Shaved Brussels sprouts, apples, funky chunks of blue cheese, apple cider vinaigrette. Don't like Brussels sprouts? This fresh, crispy little number just might sway you. The acid punch of the dressing is also a nice foil to the richness of the poutine and makes for a nice interbite intermezzos.

The poutine is simply the best I've ever had. The basics, all equally important, are done perfectly. The fries are the house-cut, rustic skin on variety. Cooked perfectly, crispy and robust enough to stand up to the gravy onslaught. The gravy, an unctous, burnt umber liquid, enrobes the starchy sticks in meat-enriched, salty smooth goodness. Toss in some bite-sized, ooey, gooey cheese curds that fill in the cracks like edible mortar. Now the fun part.

I opted for the rabbit pot pie variant. See above for the base upon which was added fresh peas, diced carrots, onion and celery. I wish they'd been a bit more bountiful with the bunny, but it was delicious albeit a tad unseasonable. I mean it was nearly 80F outside as I ate it. My wife, a celebrant of the traditionally American, went full on Pogo. They put a fully dressed corndog on top of the aofrementioned poutine pile and dress it with coleslaw, mustard and ketchup. The sweetness of the mustard, the acidic slaw, the soft, spongy breading and the freshly-made, almost beefy-tasting Red Wattle pork hotdog. An American/Canadian mashup.

So allow me to repeat. Poutine. Craft beer (wine, if that's your thing). Sausage. Do the math and then get your butt to Banter."}
{"text":"This place was great. It reminded me of a newly renovated, upscale loft. It was extremely clean.  The guys working the bar and kitchen even had aprons on which was a nice touch. Massive beer selection. They have 2 rooms full of beer coolers you can browse. They also have about 6 taps.

The food was out of this world.   I had the Polish boy. It had coleslaw on it and it had a BBQ sauce that was divine, because it wasn't too sweet. Everything tasted very fresh. The size of the polish boy was enough to make it a meal for me. 

Overall this was a pretty cool place that didn't seem hipster or overly pretentious. I will definitely be back to try the corndog please."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Banter. The poutine is made so well. My friend had actually brought me, and I was stoked. 

We both had poutine. ( I had the regular option, while my friend had the Vladimir Poutine.) We both also tried their draft beers, which were fantastic.

The owners even went to Canada for a long trip to try various poutines, so they could better serve it to us. To me, that's dedication. Definitely my kind of people. 

Their wine and beer selection is massive. Some of its a better deal than others. But it's still impressive. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots in Cleveland. Grab a bottle of beer or wine from the back or grab something on draft, there's always something for everyone. (Bonus: Also operates as a store. Great spot to grab some six packs or bottles. Drink it there or take it to go. Great new shop for some craft brews)

The breakfast dog is my personal favorite (make sure to get extra blueberry mustard, trust me).  And you literally can't go wrong with any of the poutine choices. I've been to Toronto twice within the last year and I still haven't found better poutine there than what's served at Banter."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer and the food is fantastic. The rabbit-stew poutine and the black-bean bratwurst are my favorites. Banter salad (shaved apple and brussel sprouts) are a great complement to the heavier poutine. Best selection of beer/wine to go for miles around."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. They always have a great beer and wine selection and it is nice to leave dinner with a bottle or a 6-pack to take home. The food is cozy comfort food. They really do a nice job across the board."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Banter, but left feeling kind of lukewarm about it.  I'm a huge fan of poutine, so I had very high hopes for Banter, especially after hearing rave reviews from friends.  

The atmosphere is pretty minimalistic and definitely felt more like a fast casual restaurant, which just wasn't what I was expecting.  They do offer beer and soft drinks in refrigerators for customers to peruse, which was nice.  

For my food, I ordered the chicken, bacon, ranch poutine, as I'm a huge fan of ranch and bacon, and will order anything \"chicken, bacon, ranch.\"  That being said, I was a little disappointed with this dish.  Don't get me wrong, it was okay, but it really just tasted like regular poutine.  It was severely lacking in ranch.  The bacon and chicken were just meh.  I think I would have been better off ordering the traditional poutine, as I did enjoy the fries, cheese curds, and gravy on my chicken, bacon, ranch.  The portions were also huge, and I left over half of my meal on my plate, but opted not to take it home, as I figured french fries don't reheat well.

I'm glad I tried it and it was an okay meal, I just had higher hopes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very comfortable neighborhood joint that isn't as pricy as you might expect. Portions are large, food is freshly prepared using fresh ingredients, and most importantly it tastes good! Haven't had a beer here yet but the idea of grabbing one from their large selection in fridges is an awesome idea. Pick up a 6-pack, drink one with your meal for a small surcharge and you're good to go!

Had some obscure soccer game on Fox Soccer Plus. Great to have something unique on and talked to bartender who was an Arsenal fan.

My brother and I split Banter Disco and Heritage Pork. Both were fantastic. I went to a place well rated on Yelp in Montreal and Banter definitely topped that.

Definitely head to Superelectric afterwards!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Banter. It has an amazing beer selection, amazing poutine, and the best sausage I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, very modern and clean. everything is open concept and super casual and relaxed. Ordered the polish boy and my partner had the weekly special - both were fantastic, but the Polish boy was very spicy. I like heat but i wish there was a warning! Other than that, everything was to die for. we shared the classic Banter poutine and it was to die for. Service was fantastic as well. would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went right after we beat the Blue Jays in the ALCS, but we were still welcomed Indians' fans. Great place! Poutine was the bomb and the service was great. Thanks for bringing the Canadian vibes and tastes to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came back here and tried the Forest City Poutine.......might be the best thing I've tasted in Cleveland since moving here."}
{"text":"I had already given this place 5 stars in a previous review, but wanted to add that I took my friend here who was visiting from out of town and he absolutely loved it as well. We split 2 plates of poutine and left absolutely stuffed."}
{"text":"Food was great they had vegetarian options which was a nice surprise.  Also loved that I could stop but the beer and wine shop and pay for everything at once."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a hot mess Sunday full of good food, drink, and shenanigans? Then Banter is your place! I stopped by with a friend on a Sunday afternoon after a workout and we enjoyed their fried chicken sausage sandwich and their chicken paprikash poutine (just be aware that they salt everything so if you don't want salt on your fries or cheese curds tell them when you place your order). We also enjoyed their beer and wine selection. 

How was this a hot mess? A random guy sat next to me at the bar and started chatting with me, turns out he is the brother of someone I know. Next up some friendly people from Memphis and Greenhouse Tavern showed up and shared their three bottles of wine with us. Dropping of glasses, beard inquires, harassment of staff, and awkward compliments to other patrons may have then transpired. The kicker was when one of the cooks told me we went on an OkCupid date together about 1 1/2 - 2 years ago. It was not the greatest of dates and once the realization hit me I immediately ran out. 

I will definitely be back because the food was good, the atmosphere friendly, and the other customers a riot, but probably not on a weekend when Jeff is working, well, unless I have my hair and makeup done and I am wearing some sexy number...




***Update: They should make dessert poutine!! Churro fries with chocolate and marshmallows or toasted pound cake fries with fruit topping and mascarpone cheese! I know, I am a genius."}
{"text":"Don't go here expecting classic poutine because you won't get it.  I've tried multiple things on the menu wanting to like it, but everything I've tried here just tastes off.  Not only that, the decor is kind of cold and not very inviting."}
{"text":"I've traveled all the way to Montreal for poutine (well maybe not JUST for poutine, but it definitely played a part in me booking that trip), and I can honestly say that this poutine rivals anything I've had in Canada. Every time I try a new variety, it instantly becomes my new favorite. I've tried their sausage and sides too, and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. You won't regret giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try poutine for a while now and finding a place that had a vegetarian version in Cleveland was a bonus.  Located in the Gordon Square area, Banter is a cool place, which keeps it simple and straightforward.  The decor is clean, mostly white with not much to distract.  The menu is also simple and focused; there is poutine, sausages and a couple of salads.  A nice list of beer and wine is available.

I ordered the vegetable poutine, which was sensational.  The poutine is a large portion of excellent french fries, crisp and hot with a good potato taste.  Topped with a very nice vegetable gravy and cheese curds you have a very satisfying dish.  The gravy is smooth and nicely balanced with a mellow onion flavor and some depth.  The highlight of the dish is the cheese curds, fresh and chewy with a nice round flavor that hits the spot.

Banter has decided to focus on a few items and do them very well, give them a try to find excellent execution at a nice casual place."}
{"text":"Workers are really friendly and the set up is pretty cool. Love the breakfast sausage and that they had Zombie Dust on top when we went!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere - stop in, pick a bottle of wine or six-pack from their pantry and have a seat in their trendy, minimalist restaurant. Several food options available (including the best cheese curds you've ever had). What you don't drink, you take home. Great place to start your night out, end it, or spend the whole evening here."}
{"text":"This place closes at 1am (so perfect for those late night munchies). It's the absolute best way to either end the night or get it started. Choose from a wide selection of beers from their fridges or their even more diverse array of poutines. I recommend the Vladimir poutine with its hint of orange. The fried cheese curds are also a must try!"}
{"text":"Went to check this place out for the first time yesterday and I must say I was really impressed. The poutine and sausage isn't new overall(very we'll know and good in Canada) but it's certainly new to the Cleveland area. It's a new creative concept where you can order from a pretty good selection of sausages and Poutine . Also there an incredible selection of beers to choose from. You just browse the selection and pick up the one you like and bring it to the table. One side of a banter is more like a bar and the other side has tables where you can sit down with a group. I tried the Vladimir Poutine and the Clevelander and Fried Chicken Sausage. You get a pretty good portion for the price. I definitely will be checking out this place again in the future. Added to my list of favorite west side spots!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate after passing  several magic competency exams;  including beer, sausage and poutine. There was even a sparkling wine tasting going on.  I love the theme of walking up to a cooler, choosing and opening your very own fun in a can or bottle.

The currywurst was quite tasty. The brussel sprout salad was spectacular. Service was fantastic bit laid-back at the same time. I ran into a very cool group of IT coders, whom I hope to see again.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Had the banter poutine and it was great in comparison to other poutines I've had in the past. I also had the duck sausage, which wasn't very impressive at all. The most impressive element was the bottle room. Some very impressive bombers and beer bottle options."}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about this place. Delicious, unpretentious, friendly staff, great beer selections....if it wouldn't land me in the hospital I'd be here every day. 

The poutine options are ridiculous in the best way possible, and while I can't speak to their authenticity, I can vouch for their tastiness. This is the stuff dreams are made of, if you dream of French fries, cheese and gravy. The only sandwich I've had so far is the po-boy and it was just as quality as the poutine. The flavor of the sausage was crazy with just the right meat-to-bun ratio. 

The other plus is the price. You won't leave hungry, sober or poor. That's a win-win in my book."}
{"text":"Was finally able to check out Banter & unlike the Browns, it didn't disappoint. Tried the chicken fried sausage, Farm poutine, & the whatever beer the bartender recommend (IPA I think?) All were great & just what I needed (mostly the beer) after watching another loss. The staff was very friendly & even provided me with the WiFi code so that I could get some work done while there. Great addition to the neighborhood & I look forward to trying their other menu items during my next trip."}
{"text":"Food is on point and reasonably priced with a friendly staff.  The restaurant layout offers a variety of options between a casual bar area, a dining room with some larger tables, a nice patio in the warmer months, and a great collection of beer and wine in the back room."}
{"text":"I order a veg dish and I got one!!! It was full of gravy , mushrooms and delicious!  We stopped to have a drink and food and this place had super rare beers! So what do you want? They have it. Rare stouts, rare ipa's and ciders! Fun time and I totally love Cleveland bar vibe! They have a patio in the back."}
{"text":"The Cider was very tasty.  The Disco was new twist on sloppy joes. And the service was very friendly, Thanks Matthew for you service."}
{"text":"We came here on a slow Wednesday night. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. 

I really wanted to try the Polish boy, but most other places that served were already closed. So we tried Banter Beer & Wine and I don't regret it one bit. My wife and I both ordered the same thing, which is a rare occurrence, and was really amazed at how delicious the polish boy was. I would come back here, but I would probably try a couple of the other joints in Cleveland before I gave this place another try. 

As for the polish boy, it was very saucy and had plenty of ingredients to go with the polish sausage. It was a little pricey but worth every bite."}
{"text":"first time last night... bloody yummy! treat yourself and try this place... with a cold snap in the air, you will find the poutine a perfect match. We tried three things. I think the pork shoulder was the winner. looking forward to trying more. Great beer on tap selection too."}
{"text":"upscale post drink food to soak up the alcohol.  we had the Polish boy which is a regional staple.  It's a hot dog or sausage with lots of toppings.  Banter's take on it is brilliant.  The sauce is outstanding  as is the service.  we also had the rabbit poutine and it was also absolutely delicious. the fries are on point, sweet amd savory."}
{"text":"Banter is everything I never knew I needed. Anytime I go to Banter moving forward, I will always be a happy camper.

The food is downright delicious. I journeyed to Banter with the Yelp May Supper Club and no one in our large party was unsatisfied. I had the Chicken Paprikash Poutine, because you know, I'm a good Polish girl. I loved the flavor on this dish. I was a little skeptical of poutine, but now, I'm a believer. 

Banter itself has a cool layout. The inside is grocery style, so you can literally pick your own beer or wine out of the case and bring it back to your table efficiently. I was pleasantly surprised to find my favorite Radler from when I lived in Germany, and the alcohol selection is magically diverse. The interior is simplistically decorated, as its clear the star of the show here is really the food and beverage. Their poutine selection is endless and creative.

You absolutely cannot go wrong at Banter, and I can't wait to come back again soon. Banter is an awesome place to meet friends and enjoy a really, really good beer and interesting food."}
{"text":"Friends, I have found a miracle cure for hangovers. And while I could have gone to the press first, I've decided to announce it to my pals here on Yelp Dot Com. Unfortunately, the cure is located solely at this one single place in the universe, and it is a giant plate of fries covered in gravy, cheese curds, and pretty much whatever else you want on it. I'm sorry, but that's just how medical science works. I don't make the rules. 

Hit this joint up for brunch after a hard night of the devil's sauce, and I was fixed right up with some fancy-ass cold brew (although their beer and wine selection looks outstanding) and the finest poutine I've had anywhere outside of Toronto. And, honestly, the fries were way better here than at any soggy joint I went to there (sorry, friends to the north). I only just ate there a couple hours ago but I'm already thinking of excuses to go back there in the next week."}
{"text":"Had the traditional, delicious!  Also tried their special soft she'll poutine, wonderful as well!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Gordon Square area! Banter, as so many other reviewers have noted, has a menu divided into three sections: booze, poutine, & sausage. Simple, decadent, a little bit different. 

The decor is minimalist, all stark white & cement with no pretense. The place is surprisingly spacious, though I'd like to see them forego some of the four-tops in place of two two-person tables. The booze selection large, diverse, & impressive, & our server was friendly, helpful, & willing to explain how the whole place worked as well as to provide recommendations. For such a low-key place, Banter is impressively upscale, as far as the quality of food goes.

My boyfriend & I are now enamored of the breakfast sausage, a meal served ON A FRENCH TOAST BUN - truly on of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever tasted. We also got the standard poutine - perfect, salty, not too gravy-covered - & the Brussels sports salad, which was a refreshingly healthy (but still delicious!) bit of balance to an otherwise indulgent (read: horrible-for-us) meal. There are so many other elements of the menu that I want to try, especially the rabbit poutine - it's got a rabbit stew on top, peas & carrots & all - & the Polish Boy, kielbasa topped with frites, BBQ sauce, & slaw. 

Only complaint: The stools are SO UNCOMFORTABLE. At 5'4\", I'm not THAT short, but my feet couldn't reach the foot bar at the bottom of the stool to help me keep my balance, & the slick metal had me sliding around... & down... & off... I spent the entirety of my meal trying to be sure I didn't slide right off! I'd love to see better seating with us short folks in mind, as this was an unfortunate interference in my enjoyment of my meal & the overall experience.

That said, I would spend an entire meal standing if it meant eating fried cheese curds, so I can't really complain. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had a very negative experience here where my significant other and I were harassed for being homosexuals by a table and the staff who were friends with the table. This is not a bar that is friendly to the LGBT community, and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bar with an extensive beer and wine selection - they had a lot of beers I haven't seen at other bars in Cleveland. I came here for the food, specifically the poutine! I wasn't able to try the chicken paprikash, they were out when we got there at 7:15 :( we opted for the forest city poutine instead, which was pretty tasty. We also split the Polish boy, which was okay. The sauerkraut was pretty salty, but overall it wasn't bad. I'd probably just stick to ordering poutine next time, hopefully they have chicken paprikash the next time I stop in!"}
{"text":"This bar was cool but not what I expected. So I my review may be bias. I went here expecting to get some great beers and add a growler to my collection. Instead I got a restaurant with a bar store attached. I came for beer. Which they had buuuut If I wanted to go to a store I would have just went to a store. The food looked good and everything was reasonably priced. I'll definitely be going back but more on a date type situation instead of a journey for beers and breweries."}
{"text":"I found a little slice of Portland, Oregon in Cleveland. Seriously, if you've ever been there or watched an episode of Portlandia then you will find out Banter is so Portland. I was nervous to take my husband to a place that only serves sausage and poutine but I promised him they had beer so he agreed. I wish I would have come sooner. The beer and wine selection is great. I had the Banter salad - SO good and flavorful. The star of the show was the Banter Poutine. Probably the best poutine I have ever had. If you have never had poutine, then Banter is the place to try it. We also shared the corndog. Overall, such an incredible meal. It IS a limited menu, but Banter is amazing at what it has to offer. We had to drive through some sketchy areas to get to Banter, but I would do it all over again, and again. They also sell wine and beer to go. Really a cool spot in Cleveland. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in thei mood for something unique in the area."}
{"text":"Biggest variety of poutine I've ever seen on a menu, which was fun to try.  We had chicken paprikash and the classic poutine.  Fries are excellent and sturdy enough to withhold lots of gravy, cheese, and magical sauces.  I got a chardonnay that I really enjoyed - twice.  Ambiance is chill and trendy."}
{"text":"Great first impression here. The wine and beer selection is well curated and the little menu is full of treats. We tried the excellent Brussels sprout salad, proper basic poutine, and a couple of sausages. The ingredients are top-notch, and you can get a tasty meal and a couple of drinks for two for around $50 - not bad given the quality. It doesn't really bother me, but I think they'd be wise to add a vegetarian sausage to complement the vegetarian poutine. Pickings are very slim for those who eschew meat. I can imagine being a frequent flyer here, especially since I pass it every day on my commute."}
{"text":"I've been to Banter about a half dozen times. I mostly use it for the retail bottle shop in the back, so that will be the focus of this review. 

Service: staff is always pleasant, well informed about the wine and beer, and eager to help answer questions or make suggestions. 

Ambience: casual, minimalistic bar area that always appears clean. A step above a dive bar. Not a sports bar (one small TV). Big glass windows at the store front allows natural light to flood in during the day. A bit dark at night. 

Product: rotating selection of wines and beer that you might not find elsewhere especially if you mostly shop at the grocery. Inventory definitely has variety. Beer is not just IPA's and hoppy offerings, and they stock international brews too. A couple fridges dedicated to build your own six packs. One knock, some of the six packs can be a bit old so be sure to check the age statement especially if you are buying something that is best drunk fresh (e.g., IPA's)

Overall: recommended"}
{"text":"This gets a grudging four starts, mostly because there's nothing around that's a fair comparison.  

I'm a big fan of their method of beer and wine sales.  It really puts the agency back with the consumer rather than just peering at a list awkwardly for a few minutes and then choosing something at random.  I feel like I'm able to take my time, shop around, and think about my choice.  

The decor is great.  It may be a bit too much \"IKEA catalog\" for some people, but I don't know when we all decided that our \"neighborhood bar\" type places were supposed to look like basements, so I'm fine with it.  

The food is unique.  I haven't been anywhere that features poutine as such a centerpiece, let alone poutine with so many toppings.  The sausages are great, too.  For two people, you can get by with a sausage apiece and an order of poutine to split between the two of you.  

The only thing that sets me back is price.  For two people (two sausages, two beers, and an order of poutine), it's going to come to around $50, which honestly is a bit high.  Granted, everything is high-quality, there's a ton of unique stuff on the menu (check out the Vladimir Poutine and other things they've got on their regular menu), and the service is great, but that price point is something I have trouble getting over.  It shouldn't stop you from going there because I'm a cheapskate, though."}
{"text":"So happy to have a good selection of beer and wine within walking distance! Staff very attentive and helpful in explaining the deal - order from the bar or pick out a bottle and enjoy there for a small bottle opening  fee.. I think 1.50 or 2.50 depending on size. And veg friendly poutines in the future!!"}
{"text":"Good poutine! Even better paired with the beer selection. I wasn't really hungry when I went in but lol finished the whole plate anyway! It was a good experience."}
{"text":"Loved the minimalist look of place it my fav style. But on to the real stuff... food. Mmm yummy poutine amazing, fries are like a perfect little bed for the toppings to get all cozy on. But the absolute star of the show was the garlic aioli that already comes with the fries, I didn't even have to ask!!! I always ask for garlic aioli and if you have it you're awesome, if It's good you're amazing, if you bring it with out asking you automatically get 5 stars on yelp. Congrats lol."}
{"text":"Really damn good dogs and poutine... And beer. Minimal, unassuming and unique decor that keeps ones focus on the view of the kitchen, hungrily awaiting foie gras, duck confit, and delicious legit gravy enthroned upon a bed of fat crispy fries. My favorite spot right now!"}
{"text":"Great poutine! Just what I expected Harry and flavorful. The poutine dish I had came with tender pork shoulder, jalapeño and of course fries gravy with cheese curds. Just what you need with weather like today.
Over all atmosphere was low key comfortable friendly. Not crowded or too noisy. This was also around 5pm and was the second person through the door. Perfect for an early Saturday dinner. Good service too. Definitely a place to visit for some wonderful comfort food. I also believe e there are at least two veggie style dishes."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious food. Sampled the foie gras, Vladimir Poutine , fried chicken sausage and breakfast sausage. Each and every dish was excellent. 

The wine selection and beer on tap was ample. The service was attentive yet not intrusive. 

I would recommend this spot to locals and folks traveling to Cleveland looking for a memorable place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out for brunch. It was a cool little place, with a pretty good beer and wine selection. They do let you make your own 4 or 6 packs to take home or you can chose anything in the cooler to enjoy there and they will just charge a corking fee. Same with the wine, we went with a bottle of champagne and just split the cost between the 5 of us. They also have a draft selection to avoid the corking fee. The food was overall good. The pierogis were by far the hit. Absolutely delicious, maybe one of the best I've ever had, cooked with perfectly caramelized onions and topped with creme fresh. The forest city poutine was also fabulous if you like mushrooms and truffle, delicious! The traditional poutine was just okay, of course very heavy and the cheese wasn't pungent enough for me. I would recommend checking them out if you like beer and carbs!!"}
{"text":"So happy a place like this opened up in this side of town---we need more like it. Not a ton of seating, and the decor is simple but it works. There are 3 rooms- a \"dining\" room, wine room, and beer room. The guy in the wine room really know his stuff and was extremely friendly and outgoing. I think the interaction we had with him is what really made me want to give this place 5 stars. 

There are corking fees for the wine is you drink it there ($10) but it's important to keep in your mind that they selling the wine at retail price, and being a *business* they have to make money somehow. There is also a fee if you grab some beer from the beer room-$1.50 I think it was. They also have beer and cider on tap, but I did feel like it was kinda pricey. My manfriend and I ordered 2 drinks,   1 banter poutine and 2 polish boy and it was around $35. 

Now I am NOT a coleslaw fan at all. The polish big was loaded with coleslaw and I knew I had to at least try it. It was awesome!!! Omg it was so fresh and so good! I wanted more!!

I hope this place sticks around. It's definitely refreshing to see a place like that open up over there!!"}
{"text":"Great spot, amazing selection of beer. While the large windows make it easy to see what's happening, this location DOES NOT have a drive thru. Just FYI, if you were unsure about that detail."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great for the community and a nice variation on Gordon square.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent Poutine and brats!  This is a very different restaurant for Cleveland but it's worth checking out.  Kinda small but not crowded.  Beer and wine list is not the biggest but you can certainly find something you like and they are very helpful if you need suggestions."}
{"text":"We had the protean and the polish boy along with some imports. Food was a great surprise. Very fresh dog with tasty toppings.

Take some French fries and spread some cheese, sauce and shredded beef around and you have the makings of some great comfort food. 

Quite a selection of beers and wine in a very cool atmosphere. Good place for conversation with top notch food and beverage. 

A good place in a developing city neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a nice place to go to when you want a comfortable neighborhood place to have something good to eat and drink while watching the game. As the veggie, I had the black bean bratwurst and the Brussels sprout and apple salad.  So good! The BF had the Pot Pie Poutine and ate every single bite. Not a curd was left.  They have a really robust assortment of crafts bears on tap or in bottles and cans from their mini beer store next door. The staff is friendly and laid back.  Local or visitor make stop here for pure happiness"}
{"text":"At the edge of the Gordon Square district, Banter is a solid spot if you want edge of your seat poutine! Great local twists on this awesome dish. Most recently had the Paprikash Poutine and it was very tasty. Had the right amount of sauce, cheese and pulled chicken. Great place to be amongst friends, chat with the personable staff and have a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the vegan sausage, which sounds great! Unfortunately, both the regular bun and gluten-free bun aren't vegan. Nice to see a vegan poutine option on the menu but sincerely hope they're able to add a plant-based bun. I live nearby and was disappointed."}
{"text":"The Ambiance here was not what I expected. It had a very Stark cafeteria feel. Like it wasn't finished with being remodeled or decorated.  The staff was great very friendly and accommodating. I had a very nice Malbec & the bacon chicken poutine. The toppings were all great but the french fries were awful dried up and not very hot. It could use some more cheese curds and sauce to help with the dried up french fries. The bearbeer nuts appetizers were awesome and out of this world!  a mix of sugary and then an after kick of spicy. I could have eaten those all night.
The deep-fried protein was also very yummy..
I'm going to give this place another chance maybe try something a little more basic when it comes to the poutine."}
{"text":"The Poutine here is on point. I would recommend the rabbit pot pie, the Foie Gras is really good too they had a grate selection of beers and wines I will definitely be going back sometime later on."}
{"text":"This place is very Cleveland.....  They mix ethnic foods of pierogi's, papikash, etc with hot dogs and fries.   Their food is amazing, filling, and large portions.   We underestimated and had way too much food.   We also made the the mistake of thinking this was a one-room restuarant so we sat on stools which were not comfortable.   We did discover there is another room with lower chairs.   They also have multiple coolers of beer so please even the most picky beer drinker.  I tried an unfiltered wheat which was good and my husband got a lemongrass ginger cider which was amazing!!   We tried the fried chicken sausage, pepperchini  sausage, brussel sprouts, and rabbit stew poutine.   I enjoyed the poutine greatly.   


 I loved the decor, but I do agree with others that there is an Ikea overload.    The staff was friendly and inviting.   We got excellent service between world cup whistles ;-)."}
{"text":"As if you need another reason to go other than amazing poutine!! But the selection of beer, wine and cider is hands-down one of the best around. 

Have a favorite Belgian beer? Oh they probably have it. Into obscure French cider? Yeah they have that too. Just looking for a massive selection of stuff you can't find anywhere else? You're definitely in the right place. 

You can pick out anything they carry to drink with your food (with a small fee) or take it home. If you ever get a chance to attend a tasting here, I highly recommend it -- it's a great opportunity to try things you may not see anywhere else! 

Oh and while you're there, definitely go for some sloppy joe poutine or a corn dog!"}
{"text":"Sausages and fries smothered in meaty, cheesy toppings...what more can I say? The menu is small, but has something for every palate and preference. I got the porciniwurst (mushroom veg sausage) and it was served in a garlicky roll and smothered in a delicious marinara. The heaping pile of chicken paprikash poutine is more than big enough for two to share. I highly recommend this small shop for a quick and tasty, casual bite."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere in here and the unique menu. I got the chicken paprikash poutine and it was just a little too salty for me but I do want to give Banter another try. I like the fact that there is a beer and wine store within its fun to browse around."}
{"text":"Poutine and alcohol, what's not to love! This little space is right up my alley!
Cheese curds, fries, and gravy = a happy Allie!
There really isn't much parking so find a spot on the street and come inside.  Once inside it's seat yourself in the bar area or through the back doorway into the next room.  Once you sit down peruse the menu, decide how you can possibly eat all the options and then get up and pick your drink of choice in the next room. They have a great selection of beers, wine, and ciders from all over the globe.  Once you pick you drink, bring it back to the table and your server will open it and bring glasses.
Not much needs to be said, come HANGRY, bring friends so you can try everything (wild mushroom poutine!) and spend time eating yourself into carb coma! Go forth and don't say I did't warn you when you wattle out!"}
{"text":"Really friendly worker who was willing to help choose what to order. 

The menu is poutine or sausage (or hot dog) sandwiches. They are over stuffed fork and knife kind of sandwiches. I tried the Cleveland Sausage sandwich which had a kielbasa with a pierogi on it. Sauerkraut was piled high on top and a conservative amount of stadium mustard was drizzled on top. I think it took a bit long to come out of the kitchen for what it was, but the sandwhich was good. It wasn't a super heavy meal and not as unhealthy as it sounds. At $9 it was a cheap lunch. 

My friend got a poutine which was a large serving and it looked good. 

The place actually got pretty busy around noon on a Friday. Free street parking right in front."}
{"text":"We were able to quickly sit down at the bar and I decided to get the breakfast and my girlfriend got the corn dog poutine. I couldn't believe how good both of our meals were and everyone there was super nice. Great quality food with a Cleveland twist!"}
{"text":"We had the banter original and the paperkash. SO GOOD!! So filling!!! Perfect hangover food. Loved the beer selection-you don't find that and it was so fun to look at all the beers. We are outside and it was marvelous. Really friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I love the different variety of poutine and the large wine selection. We had the chicken paprikash and rabbit poutine. The portions are large and they were both equally delicious! Also had the Brussel sprout and apple salad which was amazingly refreshing  and a good balance with the hearty poutine."}

There's a lot to love about Banter. For starters, plenty of seating, you have the option of sitting up at the bar to hang out with their friendly bartenders, or grabbing a table in the adjoining room, where you can grab bottled or canned beer at your leisure. Speaking of the beer cooler, holy selection! Some of my local grocery stores don't even have this much to choose from. I love being able to see the beers in person rather than looking at a list, and although they are marked up slightly from retail, it's still very reasonable. As for the food, you kind of can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. It's heavy, delicious food that compliments a beer perfectly (or the other way around, I'm not sure). My personal favorite is the plain fried cheese curds served with marinara. There's just something about such a simplistic offering that makes me happy. I have tried the poutine and some of the sausage sandwiches as well, my recommendation is definitely plan for sharing. The poutine portions are very large, and since it's so rich, I don't think most people would be able to finish it on their own. Also, I am an \"on the side\" kind of gal, I often order sauces and toppings on the side so I can add them a little more sparingly, and I do have to say that Banter goes OTT with piling up those dishes with sauce and toppings. Most people probably love this, but I think it's a fair point to mention that if you don't think you'll be able to finish the whole sandwich for example, you might want to order the sauces on the side so your meal doesn't get too soggy. For example, one of the sandwiches I ordered had BBQ sauce, and the whole sandwich was absolutely smothered in BBQ. The BBQ sauce itself was fantastic, it was slightly smokey with a a lot of spice, but I definitely felt there was too much for me personally and next time I would get it to dip rather than on the sandwich itself. Other than that I really like it here, very chill vibe for a weekend hangout and the beer selection is amazing."}
