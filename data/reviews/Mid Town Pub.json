{"text":"Mid Town, I'm just not sure about you. You look like a liquor store from the outside and a bit like a refurbished Ground Round on the inside. I feel confused.  I went on a Friday night looking for a new fish fry place. Walked in to a busy restaurant without a hostess in sight. We sort of wandered around trying to figure out if it was seat yourself or hosted. There were a number of open tables, but I felt like we needed to talk to someone to get a table. Finally, we made eye contact with a woman who asked if we needed help. She told us there would be 30 minute wait, so we put our name on the list. About 5 minutes later she said \"I guess you can sit here\" and directed us to a table.  Something that I found a bit strange was that the light bulbs above our table were red, which made me feel as though they were warming lights, and also made it a bit hard to see the dark menu. Also, I'm not sure the wait staff are assigned to any particular tables, which confused me a bit. We ended up having about 3 people wait on us, which was fine and they were all really very nice.  They have a nice selection of local craft beers (mostly in bottles, but several on tap as well). We started with an order of jalapeño poppers, which were really good: half of a jalapeño filled with cream cheese, breaded and deep fried. Probably from a bag, but still good!  I went for the fried cod and my date decided to go for the lump crab cakes, which are billed as an original recipe. The cod was ok. The tops of the pieces were nice and crispy, but the bottom half was soggy from sitting in a pool of grease. The fish came with a side (I went for waffle fries, which were pretty standard) and a piece of formerly frozen garlic bread (it is what it is). The crab cakes were really quite large, which was nice, but definitely way too salty.  The tap beers were priced well, but the food was a little over priced, I think. I feel like Mid Town is a great place to get a glass of beer and a basket of popcorn or an appetizer, and just kill some time, but I'm not sure I'll be rushing to go back, though we were intrigued by this DIY Bloody Mary thing..."}
{"text":"The Friday fish fry is outstanding! If you haven't tried it you should. I wash the meal down with a tap of Smithwick's. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This has always been a great go to place. Was here recently for a Bloody Mary and met Tina. She made the experience .   Thank you mid town n Tina. ( the 80's rocked)  Patrick"}
{"text":"Decided to try the Midtown Pub on Saturday night. It's close to home and we just had a busy day with kids' activities.  Service here is excellent! The kids were big fans of the baskets of popcorn. Burgers were quite good (Dotty's is still the gold standard). To have a place close to home, with good service and classic pub food, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food (personal favorite: popper burger - cream cheese + jalapeños), good service (everyone is always incredibly friendly, to the point of 4-5 people saying hello/good-bye), neighborhood feel.   All the things you want in a bar & grill."}
{"text":"The food is very good bar food, although it goes beyond bar food.  My favorite item on the menu is the Mediterranean Chicken Salad with Basil Vinaigrette dressing.  There aren't too many bars that would be able to pull that one off.  The chicken on the salad is a delicious grilled chicken breast, not Sysco chicken strips that have been microwaved -- and the dressing is out of this world.  They have a very good beer list AND a very good wine list.  So although it looks like a typical Wisconsin bar, their wine list is a lot better than most.  Popcorn is always tasty and the service is prompt and friendly.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Six of us went to Mid Town on a recent Fri night.  4 ordered the fish dinner and 2 of us the fish sandwich plate.  The server asked if anyone wanted sour cream and one person said yes.  We had the fish sandwich plate and were asked if we wanted a side which could be sweet potato fries, onion rings, various other potatoes or soup.  One of us chose sweet potato fries and the other the onion rings.   We asked if the price was the same and the server said they were all the same.  When the bill came, there was an up charge for the sour cream, sweet potato fries and onion rings.  We brought it to the server's attention and he said \"Sorry, my fault\" and did not offer to remove the charge.  We decided to let it go and just left the restaurant. All were a bit disappointed in their first experience."}
{"text":"It is a fun bar. Older crowd . Excellent service . Nothing to complain about the food. However, I was surprised when I got the bill and was charged extra for miscellaneous liquor. Apparently the bartender was pouring doubles without my knowledge and then charged me for it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic all around. Can't say a bad thing about this place. Everyone's incredibly friendly and the food is great. Try the curds... my favorite in town."}
{"text":"OPEN LATE! Great food, special homemade dinners each night(get there by 9pm for those)...music is always good n loud enough to hear it! Best of all are the Bartenders!  They are All so nice n friendly - you will feel right at home even if you are a business traveler and if you are a woman alone.. It's ok..I always feel safe there as I work late n like to unwind a little and it's perfect."}
{"text":"Don't understand all the positive reviews for this place.  Employees were friendly, but the food was so-so at best and the owner was shouting at another customer about politics while I was trying to eat.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here for the Sunday make your own Bloody Mary bar! Very fun! Very friendly! A happy place with great food and drink!"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Mid-Town Pub for many years with at least three dozen visits mainly for the Friday fish fry/grill. The cod you get here is as good as you will find anywhere. Now for some gripes. 1.The service. A policy that all waitstaff share waiting on all customers works fine sometimes but awful on others. As a typical example, fish order took more than an hour to arrive ( blame that on the chef I suppose) but the salads we ordered didn't arrive until after we finished the main course. A single attentive waitstaff would certainly have done a better job than having no one person being responsible for anything. 2. Sandwich menu. Other than the fish the food here is marginal. Sandwiches are generally blah with the fried walleye sandwich leading the blah category - incredibly over fried, dry with a dark brown almost black crust. If you want walleye on Friday, for goodness sake go to The Great Dane Pub!"}
{"text":"Great place, good atmosphere, good pub fare, has become my go-to when I am looking for lunch and a couple Bloody Mary's or to catch the Badgers or Packers playing. Bloody Mary's are always fantastic, 2 w a couple Spotted Cow chasers are enough to have that perfect afternoon or Sunday \"slow buzz\" :-) Food is standard pub types, def above average taste and prep though. All in all, it's your neighborhood \"Cheers\" setting with a sports bar/family friendly/good time spin."}
{"text":"Once inside you forget you're in a strip mall, this place is delightful.  The staff is friendly and engaging, even the owner bounces around filling popcorn and making wise-cracks.  If the bartender saw we were low on beer and our waitress was busy he'd come to our table.  In some places the staff is totally like \"Not my job, I'll find your waitress *sigh*\" here it was all collaborative and made the experience awesome.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at the mid town pub."}
{"text":"We had the cod special, It was very good and the service was the best. Very very friendly wait staff, love kids  Thanks"}
{"text":"Consistently good quality food with excellent service and a deep selection of liquor. One of our favorite stops in Middleton! FYI, the hostess is very rude but the bartenders more than make up for it."}
{"text":"Hoooo boy. I took my brother and his lady friend here for fish fry last week. I raved about how great it was, so they wanted to try. As expected, the fish was excellent: crunchy, flaky, beer battered, golden brown perfection. The service, however, was not great. It all began when my brother's girlfriend asked one of our servers if the kitchen cooks shellfish in the same oil as the fries and fish fry (she's allergic to shellfish but not regular fish). The waitress told us that shellfish has seperate cooking oil, so she ordered the fish fry with us. About 15 min after the table placed our orders, the waitress came back to tell us that shellfish is cooked in all the fryers. Our companion needed to look at the menu again to figure out something to eat...most food at the Midtown pub is deep fried, so her options were more limited now. Up to this point, actually, the service thing wasn't a huge problem. What happened next sort of ruined the night for us though. The waitress didn't come back to take our friends' new order for a long time. Meanwhile, the kitchen must have still been working on ours. Our food actually came out while she was giving her new order. Now we had to awkwardly eat while she had nothing. No one checked on us after the food was delivered either. When her food finally came out after the rest of the table was finished eating, a server inquired about our experience. We asked to talk to a manager to let them know that the service had not been excellent. The manager's reaction was defensive. She actually blamed us for not liking their weird multi-waiter system, instead of just apologizing. I get the feeling that she thought we were complaining just to get free stuff, which wasn't the case at all. She ultimately comped us a pitcher of beer, which was nice, but our dinner experience was subpar overall. Also, all the regularly priced side dishes that our allergic friend was able to choose from were fried, so she asked for a cup of soup to go with her belated entree. They charged us 4 or 5 dollars for the substitution, and didn't mention it until we got the bill. I understand charging for a more costly substitution as a matter of normal business practice, but in this situation, that seemed like the wrong thing to do."}
{"text":"This establishment is so friendly & welcoming to anyone. The food has the homemade feel, with daily delicious specials. Very entertaining a must visit type of place!"}
{"text":"They usually have Spaten Optimator on tap, which is one of my definitions of civilization . . . They also have an excellent selection of bottled beers.   I live within walking distance of the Mid Town Pub, so I'm in here a lot. I'm usually in during the week, so it's less crowded, the music isn't so loud, and it's possible to have a nice conversation while sitting at the bar.  The Friday fish fry is good. The place does get CROWDED so be aware.   One of their Bloody Mary recipes has a modest amount of horseradish in it, which turned out to be very good."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place, they really make you feel at home. Pretty good beer selection and a great walleye fish fry."}
{"text":"The Mid Town Pub has basically become my local for three reasons: it's the closest to my apartment, it has free WiFi, and it has good food & service.  It will never be the fanciest or trendiest place even in Middleton, but what they do they do well and overall the Mid Town Pub is just a friendly place.  It is located at the end of the smaller of two strip malls on Allen Blvd.  I like the location because I can actually walk there from my place, though attempting to do this in winter with cranky Chicagoans is not advisable.  There's parking in the lot too, if your friends from Chicago can't be arsed to walk down the street.  Seriously, it was not even half a mile and not even cold out at all - I guess when you go to small liberal arts colleges or Iowa you don't walk to the bars if you can't see them from your front door.  They'd have never cut it at UW.  But I digress...  There's a little patio outside in the summer months, which is nice especially since smoking is allowed inside (at least until next March).  Even so, the Mid Town Pub is better ventilated than most places.  The place gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights but generally has a good vibe.  During the day there are lunch specials and always a few games on the tvs.    I especially like food here.  The menu is surprisingly broad and contains a lot beyond the standard bar fare.  My personal favorite is the buffalo chicken wrap, because it's made with diced cucumbers and is just delicious.  I also recommend the turkey reuben and turkey californian sandwiches, and I recently tried the porta-bleu sandwich which is a portabella mushroom cap with fried onions and artichoke hearts with bleu cheese - amazing.  They serve \"MTP Gyros\" until bartime but I've never been in the right frame of mind, let's say, to try one.  The appetizers are also well done, and most of these are served up to bartime as well.  Standards like cheese curds and and mozzarella sticks are good, but my favorite are the spicy chicken bites, which are great for sharing around a table with your friends.    The Mid Town Pub calls itself a \"WiFi Bar and Grill\" and I would say that half of the times I've been here I've brought my laptop.  It is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon, sitting at a table doing a little work while having a beer and watching the game.  The last time I stopped in I was editing a few reports while watching the Cubs dispatch an opponent while the Crew simutaneously lost.  I got the stink-eye from some other patrons due to my enthusiasm, but the bartender revealed that she too was a Cubs fan and said, \"Don't take any guff from these swine.\"  Cub-friendly bartenders and HST references will make me a devotee every time."}
{"text":"Stepped into the joint with Mikey Free on a Friday evening looking to get a couple of beers and a decent meal before heading out downtown for a couple of drinks.  The place is in a stripmall but dont let that deter you.  The most winning characteristic about this place is its hospitality and care for the little things.  I called to ask if they served food (as I have never been there before) and Jeff even conveyed friendliness on the phone.  You walk in, seat yourself and are greated quickly by a friendly, welcoming face.  The decor is traditional wisconsin bar.  Badger flags, beer signs, etc.  Menu had a lot of things that seemed to be appetizing.  I decided on the Fish Fry (the good good Catholic in me beit Friday) and wasnt dissappointed (even though I am a fish fry snob).  The tarter sauce however wasnt the best but mangable.  I also had the French onion soup and it was pretty good.  Waitstaff was amazing; both the great waitress or the other kind members of the place that walked around checking on how you were doing (and in a genuine manner!).  My absolute favorite part of this place, which I thought was soooo coool, was that as the sun started to set (roughly ~6pm on this friday, and yes it got bright in the place) a young woman walked around with a box of sunglasses offering a pair to each patron!!!  And they were all goofy-oversized-funny-trendy glasses that any person with a decent sense of humility/humor wouldnt mind donning for the 15 minutes where the sun was an issue.  This completely had me smitten.  Besides not having Miller Lite on tap, I loved the place and would recommend it to anyone.  However, since it is outside the city of Madison, they do allow smoking (I can smell myself as I type this, boo)."}
{"text":"Great place, a very active owner with good food, good drinks, and good bartenders. I wish it were a little easier to watch sporting events, but a good place that is above others in the area."}
{"text":"very  good place  to eat and hang  out to watch sports or meet friends very friendly  and food  is great  prices are good too"}
{"text":"Went to Mid town pub for lunch, was greeted upon entering as was everybody else.There was fresh popcorn bowls on all the tables. The service was spot on, they kept up with the refills for soda and also the free popcorn without asking ! Menu is large, food is good, drinks strong. Will be coming back to further tackle the menu and explore the Bloody Mary bar!!"}
{"text":"Mid Town Pub has been a frequent haunt but am going to have to find a new spot. A few weeks ago I ordered  the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. I was served another menu item that was chicken served with mounds of jalapeños. When I pointed out the error, they quickly replaced it... With the same sandwich sans jalapeños and added ham. Chicken was still steeped in jalapeño flavor. I didn't eat it but was charged for it.   Wanted to give the kitchen another chance on a recent visit and was served yet another in edible sandwich. It was so salty and pepper ladened that the first bite was my last.  This kitchen needs some guidance! Adios mtp!"}
{"text":"The owner is there often. He's friendly and obviously tries hard to run a successful business. The free popcorn is good. Kids get a full size candy bar with their meal which is a hit. The food is average. The beer list is hit or miss. The bartenders are usually pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm already giving this place a 5 just for answering the phone at 11:35PM and politely answering my question of whether they were serving food still. Also saying \"No problem, bye,\" when I said \"Thanks, bye.\" That alone is why I'll be traveling a mile out of the way to go there as opposed to a couple other places I called close to my hotel at the Hilton Garden."}
{"text":"Middleton is admittedly not a hopping spot for swanky nightlife, but if you live in the area, it's nice to know that there's a consistently good bar with a nice staff and comfortable atmosphere. Mid Town Pub fits the bill. This is my standby when I just want to get out of the house for a drink. Sit at the bar and enjoy their fairly substantial beer selection (although they do seem to be out of a lot of the beers on their list), partake of the free popcorn, maybe shoot a game of pool, and if you're hungry, order a delicious Reuben sandwich. The staff are very nice - in a recent quest to find a bar in Middleton that could make me a Golden Cadillac, this was the only place willing to go out of their way to get me what I wanted. I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I absolutely loooove this place... amazing food, super friendly staff. I'll be back! I took a friend who had never been because he was looking for just a basic but delicious burger. I told him I had the perfect place for him. So we went and he totally loved it as much as I do :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good local draft selection, tons of bottles of beer, very friendly waitress/bartender. Open very late, and fast service. The decor was unique and fun, ranging from local items to beer taps. You gotta go to this place."}
{"text":"A review by Steve L. from Oct. 2012 hits it on the head - simply stellar. The food is excellent and the staff works very well together."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere and staff of any pub i've ever been too. No place will make you want to become a regular more than here. Great specials. Food is ok, but a work in progress. Love this place tho"}
{"text":"Tried the French dip and bacon cheeseburger which were good. Pasta salad and potato salad was so-so but I appreciated being able to pick any side we wanted instead of just fries. Bloody Mary was good but a little pricey. Go when on special sun afternoons. What we really liked about this place was the casual, relaxed neighborhood feel. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was in the Middleton area for dinner at another establishment and did a quick map search for a good bar/grill to catch the end of a brewer game with my boyfriend. We arrived on Saturday night around 8pm. We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess as well as a few hellos from the bartenders. I was actually taken aback because most bartenders hate their lives working on a Saturday night. But you could tell everyone here was in a great mood and took a lot of pride in this establishment.  It was not busy so we had our choice of seating and they happily obliged to our brewer game request which was directly in our eye view.  They had a very wide selection of beer, just not a whole lot on tap. But I don't care about that stuff. I like being able to see the bottle/can, be able to read it and pour myself a glass. They also have free popcorn (which also had some cheesy chips and Cheetos mixed in) if you need a snack.  I was really impressed with the bathroom because it was super clean, very nicely decorated and had FREE tampons for the taking! I just thought that was incredibly considerate and not something you see a lot anymore.  By the end of our time there, we had been helped by every server and bartender (they all helped everyone). One of the bartenders even said goodbye to us by name as we were walking out. They have amazing customer service. We really enjoyed ourselves and will come back again!"}
{"text":"Even though the Friday fish fry is delicious...the service is some of the worst experienced!  I went with my children and ordered an appetizer because I know the service is a bit slow.  We finally had to get up and ask for our appetizer after 20 mins.  After an hour of being there we finally received our food.  To make matters worse, we ended up going to the bar just to pay our bill because no one ever came back around."}
{"text":"Lots of friends share that they come here on Facebook. First timer. Excellent service and great food. Little pricey, but tasty."}
{"text":"what else can I say??? I had time to kill (20 min) and wanted to use some Wifi and order a drink. Heads up! they serve the miller lite in tall slim cans with a frosted glass. I was expecting a bottle but miller lite is miller lite. Girls at the bar were very nice. Only down side.............NO SAMBUCA but that's ok. I ordered 2 shots of Rumchata. We are going back to try the ribs and will write an update. Overall it is a friendly bar and eatery in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Love the popcorn on all tables, love the friendly staff (they all work together to cook, bartend and wait- and mix between themselves and your tables), decor is nice and best is the sweet potato fries! yumm-o!  I have had only the portabella sandwhich here, but lots more that I would be willing to try!  one complaint was a double vodka soda was a little pricier than I would expect."}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times,usually for a few beers,rarely for food.Place is very comfortable with nice decor.What I like best about it is the top notch service!! Owner Joel makes it a practice to hire very personable,efficient employees and trains them well. Check out the \"deep\" sinks in the bathroom,would like to have them in my place.."}
{"text":"Holy Smokes this place is HUGE! I've driven past here too many times to get my Domino's fix next door.  My wife and I decided to give it a shot. I had the brat burger. I didn't care for it, it had too much meat (Yes it is a thing, even for this carnivore!). My wife ordered a different burger and she enjoyed that one.   The service was good, I'd definitely go back to try something else."}
{"text":"I have been back to the Midtown a few times since my 2015 review but haven't bothered to review it. I was there  this Saturday and had a much better time.  I had their meatloaf sandwich which was a large piece of meatloaf  with bacon and BBQ sauce and a decent bun. I had coleslaw for my side and both were very good. My buddy had a patty melt which he liked as well. It had one dark colored slice of bread on one side and a white one the other. A good idea and he liked it as well. Our waitress was prompt and refilled our water glasses quickly and had a good attitude which is always nice to see. The bad thing this time was the complimentary popcorn basket which was on all of the tables. The popcorn was mixed with apparently last weeks \"party mix\" and was not only stale but someone had sprinkled a spice mix on it that was full of garlic and terrible. It's usually just good popcorn so this was a big disappointment and I question why this was served. Just to get rid of some stale product I guess. They should have given the popcorn to the birds and dumped the party mix. It irritated me. Anyway the sandwiches were good and it was a better experience this time. I still want to like this place but it always seems something is a little off like the popcorn basket was this time. I did give them four stars this time."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch a Chicago Bears game while my g/f and her parents went on a Frank Lloyd Wright tour.  On our way back to Chicago, I didn't want them to trek 15 mins off the hwy into downtown Madison so I decided to watch the game at Mid Town Pub.  Thank you, Yelp reviews!  Great service.  My server (Shannon) chatted with me briefly and kept my drinks full.  One of the cooks came out to talk about the game a few times with the customers as well.  The servers made an effort to greet everyone and wish everyone farewell.  I also chatted with several customers who seemed to be regulars and wasn't given any grief for wearing my Bears gear in Packer-land.  It was typical bar food but they had a strong selection of beers.  Plenty of TVs, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere.  Too bad it's 3 hours away..."}
{"text":"Go for the burgers, return for the service.  For the price, you can't go wrong. ALL the staff help with service so you never need to wait for a refill on beverages. Fantastic place."}
{"text":"I don't plan on returning. Watch your bill. Over-the-top server system. Good bar area though.  An additional tip was added onto our credit card bill even After we left a cash tip on the table. Not cool. I assume that another server picked it up from the table and didn't tell anyone. That is, one of the 5 servers we had. The multi-server system is obnoxious.  Too much customer service can be a bad thing. As can an unauthorized credit card charge. Typically I would go in to resolve this, but now I vote with my feet.  If you decide to come here, watch your bill and credit card statement. Or just pay cash for the entire bill.  Two stars for the TVs and the low-key, come-as-you-are atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super fun and playful, my burger was nice and I like the options that they give. The nicey-nice is a little over the top."}
{"text":"I love the Mid Town for a few reasons:  1. Best whiskey selection I know: varied and eclectic. Plus, they've got Wolfhound.  2. The patio is one of my all-time favorite summer spots. It's small and intimate.  3. The staff are incredibly friendly, and even though I'm not there every week, they remember me. Many stars for them.  4. The bathroom is always incredibly clean, and they go the extra mile with lotion, etc. to make me feel like a lady even though I'm often sweaty and gross after a nice long hike at Pheasant Branch.  5. The food is pub food... but it's damn good. They have lots of classic options that are elevated with one or two novel ingredients. I'm a fan of their chipotle ranch for salads (which are always fresh and made with good lettuce--none of that iceburg crap).  6. There's always parking.   7. Their music always seems to be set on 90's-era tunes. Grunge and rock, thank you very much.  If you're eating there, try a brat. Any brat. Seriously. The Provoslaw Burger was my first meal there in 2011, and though I often mix it up, it remains my favorite."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, staff is very friendly & attentive. Typical bar food with a couple twists. Burgers are good, my wife's favorite is the Normandy burger with black olives & cream cheese."}
{"text":"We came here after based on a friends recommendation and smelling the food after stopping in for a drink one night. The beer selection is OK, but not great compared to other bars in Middleton with bigger taps. The food is pretty fantastic. My husband got a burger and I got the buffalo chicken wrap, both met our expectations. I also loved the house-made chipotle aioli, which paired very well with the waffle fries. Midtown was really busy for the fish fry, so service was extremely slow but very friendly. They also have free popcorn so that helped during the waits for servers to take our order/bring us our food. Overall it was a good place that we will come to again, just not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"If you are looking for someplace to go that is away from downtown Middleton, check Mid Town out! You would think that it was dive-y from the outside, but 'tis quite lively inside.   We passed here a few times and always said \"yeah, we should really stop in there...\" FINALLY we did on the eve of New Year's Eve. What a cool spot!   My husband and I always have taken a spot at the bar and the first time there we were content to have a few beers and get a handle on the busy atmosphere. The place was packed and soon after arriving, we chatted with the local attendees (a nice group!) And took down free Jello shots (whipped cream or non) whenever the Badgers scored. Lol!   The second time we were in, same great service, smaller crowd! This time we were starving and the burger that I had hit the SPOT."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday about noon, it was a very friendly atmosphere inside and the staff was great. Babe and I had a cheeseburger (mid-rare) with grilled onions and fries. Whenever we try a new American traditional pub/grill, we always try the burger and fries the same way to get a comparable; then we come back and try other things on the menu. The burger was solid only lacking a pinch of salt but had good flavor, the fries were a little limp (I like crunchy fries). Overall the neighborhood feel of the place was the best part, and I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon, so it was not too busy, even with football on the screens.  Relatively high noise level, given it's primary function is a bar.  I don't drink so all I can review is the food.  I had the Sunday special chicken tacos with regular french fries.  I asked what options there were for french fries and onion rings.  None were made fresh there, which was a little disappointing.  The chicken tasted good and was all white meat.  The chipotle aioli was just the right amount of spicy and not too much was on each taco. However, the pico de gallo could have been drained better because by the time I got to the second taco, there was a significant puddle of water mushing the remaining two tortillas. Since the tortillas are flour-based, they got gluey in the water. My own preference is a crunch like cabbage or lettuce would have been a good addition to just meat and pico."}
{"text":"Great food and large selection of beers cozy yet large space.  While Midtown Pub looks generic from the outside, stepping inside reveals an eclectic, hip, sports pub glowing with a deep tinge of red light (maybe a bit too red for our tastes ...).  There's a nice bar (though we wish it were just a bit larger) and a large space to hang out and eat.  The upscale pub food was great and plentiful.  We had the MTP Primers (prime rib sliders), patty melt, and a HUGE walleye sandwich.  We'll be back on a Sunday to try the fish tacos.  The service was accidentally great ... The servers worked as a team to get everything to our table quickly and checked in frequently, though, twenty minutes after finishing our meal, our primary server stopped by and asked, \"Are you guys still waiting on food?\"  To their credit, we visited on a busy graduation weekend and the staff handled the extra large crowd with aplomb.  Given the unassuming appearance from the outside, Midtown Pub could be considered a hidden gem in Madison.  We'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I really love the owner of this place. He used to have a place on Gammon Road that I frequented as well. He does such a great job including the deaf community. His menu is wonderful. Not your typical bar food he really cares about what is on his menu and adds A Touch of Class to it. Even your salad has freshly baked croutons that are homemade. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because once in a while in the later part of the evening I have had not so great service. I've had times when it was understaffed or really slow to serve me. But most of the time it's been a wonderful experience. The atmosphere is great all the couches chairs different seating private or any other people you have so many choices. Also the games the pool the TVs. My 10 year old daughter has been eating there with us for years and he always gives her a Kit Kat bar and chicklets. There's free popcorn on the table the minute you walk in. You can tell the owner is very hospitable and knows how to make loyal customers. The only times that the service has been poor for me... I didn't see him around. I definitely think it's a good place. My family and are loyal fans."}
{"text":"Mid Town Pub doesn't look like much from the outside (it's set in a small strip mall with several empty businesses) but it's worth pulling up and having a meal. I've been to MTP a couple of times now and have enjoyed each visit.   When you arrive there's a basket of something to munch on - I've sat down to both snack mix and popcorn. I preferred the snack mix to the popcorn; the popcorn was very salty (a smart move in a bar, it'll get you ordering drinks).   I've had the ABLT and Prime Rib sandwich. The ABLT Supreme (avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato) was a good size and pretty much what you'd expect. I ordered waffle fries and they were cut a little too thick/just a little underdone. The Prime Rib sandwich was very tasty and not too fatty - there were some pieces I had to discard, but I am much pickier than the average prime rib eater. This time I went with the sweet potato fries and they appeared to be hand-cut and were cooked well.  Staff has been friendly and there seem to be a lot of regulars. Prices can be just a touch high (my happy hour Spotted Cow was $5 - that's usually what I pay at most for a full-price SC tap downtown). I saw they've added a Beyond Meat veggie patty to their options; a Boca patty is free, but a Beyond Meat patty will add $4 to your burger.   As for ambiance, it's sports bar meets the Nitty Gritty. If I lived in the area I think it'd be a fun place to watch the game, whichever game it may be."}
{"text":"Best burger in Middleton.  The Normandy burger is absolutely fantastic. Staff and owner are really great and always make for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite bar in the city. The bartenders and waiters are so friendly. They often server the more basic bar food very late into the night, which is fantastic because food is hard to find that late in Middleton."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Do yourself a favor and get the prime rib sliders. I've been here a lot, the food and service has always been excellent! Shout out to Tina one of the bartenders for being up for conversation and suggestions!"}
{"text":"Wow! I have to say how impressed we were with Mid Town Pub! It not only smelt clean, it WAS immaculately clean. The bathrooms were both impressively clean and thoughtful- both with lotion and the women's with hygiene products. They have pool tables, dart boards, gambling machine and pull tab machines. The bar has a large stock of bottles and liquors. They serve food late and offer a service industry discount. Our bartenders Alex and Tom offered great service. They were conversational and had a lot of information to contribute to the conversation. We asked how their relationship with the owner was and they had nothing but great things to say and it was obvious they were passionate about their jobs and their place of work. This has become our #1 neighborhood bar to come to and they will have our business indefinitely! Great job, Alex and Tom! Thank you for the great experience!   -Crystal and Evan"}
{"text":"Drinks are quick and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is relaxed. The food is delicious. 10/10 would come back. It's a great place to hangout and chat. Good music. Good environment."}
{"text":"I work in the restaurant industry so dining out is very selective for me.  When I do venture out, Midtown Pub is on my go to list.  Tucked away in a strip mall, the location belies an immaculate, charming bar and grill that is quaint yet spacious and staffed with the friendliest crew in the greater Madison area. The food is excellent and there are little surprises such as an assortment of top notch salads that you can pair with a nice pour of Cakebread Chardonnay.  This, my friend is the pearl in the oyster.  Nice touch, Joel (rhymes with Noel) or as I call him, The General. This restaurant is a must for you, the kids, heck even the blue hairs show up here from time to time.  It is an outrageously great venue to catch a Badger or Packer game and the Fish Fry is a favorite, so get there early. Like them on Facebook for daily customer specials and if you're a local beer fan, Joel has them all.  The tap beer selection is HUGE, ever changing and very cutting edge.  IPA fans take note, there are serious brews here. Most of all the place has heart and that is something rare in the bar, set em down, drink em up business.  A little pot of gold in the vast wilderness of Madison area pubs. Go there!"}
{"text":"This little gem is in the weirdest location but I'm not in Middleton much. It was a pleasant surprise. Lots of TVs for sports fans, a menu with many delicious looking options, free popcorn at every table and bathrooms so clean and stocked up you feel like you're at home. Ample parking too.  I've heard many good things but it was my first time there. I had a slightly too sweet whisky sour and the Turkey Ruben with fries.   The Ruben had a nice balance of meat to kraut, the house sourdough was great but the 1000 island was...off... I'd maybe ask for it on the side next time. Still a good sandwich. My fries were way too greasy though, the only downfall of the trip.  Our waitress was really sweet and attentive. I'll be back to try the Philly or maybe the Stuffed Grilled Cheese."}
{"text":"When you walk in the first thing you'll notice is that staff will say, \"welcome to the Midtown pub!\" Or \"Hi! How are you doing tonight?!\" They make you feel welcome before you have even sat down. Food and drinks are great but what makes this place special is how they make you feel- like every customer is important. That personal aspect seems to have been lost by many restaurants and bars but not here. It's a below average strip mall with a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving!    We have passed by this place dozens of times and never thought it was much more than what it looked like from the outside, just another bar in a strip mall.  How wrong we were!  Last night we wanted to go out and have some good Wisconsin 'pub' food, but wanted to try someplace different.  After looking through reviews of numerous places on this site and others, I decided to give this place a try.  My family was a little skeptical at first, but once we entered fears began to ease.  The size, layout, decor and most importantly the food were all top notch for a pub.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was picayune, but important to me.  Last night was Friday which means Fish Fry in Wisconsin.  Of course this meant I had to partake in the all you can eat version of it!  While the initial plate was plentiful and reasonably prepared, it took FOREVER to arrive and no one ever asked if I wanted more.  I'm sure this was probably due to them being packed, but even so it did detract a little for me from my overall take on the place.  That being said, we are eagerly awaiting our next visit there!"}
{"text":"Their Bloody Mary bar is awesome! Food service can be slow but worth the wait. Great prices."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give an update to a place that very much deserves it.  Went to Midtown last Sunday for the who knows how many-eth time (at least 40/50 by now) and as always had a fantastic experience.  The servers and bartenders are warm and friendly, always making sure your needs are met, smiles on their faces, and being sure that you won't leave without a pleasant occasion.  It's places like this should make every other place around re-evaluate themselves.  The food is consistently good and well-priced, the menu has variety and some change but also is not overwhelming, and the little things mentioned in my previous review are all still present.  I initially gave them 4 stars because they're not a fancy place so they might not suit every occasion, but after going so many times in the last few years I realized that was pretty silly.  Who cares what the occasion is, Mid Town rocks and it should be #1 on your short list if you haven't been.  It makes you feel at home, and that's what I want when I go out to eat.  Bravo Mid Town.  Keep Killin' It."}
{"text":"This joint has offered me the best service since arriving to Madison. The staff are always friendly and always wanting to ensure your needs are met. The food is delicious but overly often salty (that's just a personal preference though).  I wish there were more space.  It always seems packed on a Thursday and Friday, which can be a good thing and bad thing.  Given the service and the atmosphere I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We went here for the fish fry after reading other reviews. For the most part we were very satisfied. We arrived around 5:30 and were taken to a table right away. The friendly hostess told us although she could seat us immediately, the kitchen was a little backed up. We appreciated getting this info. No problem, we were not in a hurry. Our waitress took our drink order, part of which was a vodka gimlet with olives. Tasty gimlet arrived, sans olives. After our drinks arrived, I remembered reading there was free popcorn on the tables, and could see it on other tables. We were never offered or given popcorn. It would have been nice to munch on it while waiting for our dinner. Our dinners came out after not too long of a wait, we all had the deep fried cod with fries. You also get cole slaw and a piece of garlic bread. It was all solid, we all actually liked the addition of a piece of garlic bread. Fish and fries were both piping hot and tasted great. Cole slaw was average. At this time I ordered another vodka gimlet and stressed WITH OLIVES. Again, tasty gimlet sans olives. Just don't get how they can't get it right twice??  The place itself is bigger than it looks from outside, appears bright and clean, and all the staff we dealt with were extremely friendly. Maybe bring your own olives if you require them, and then it will be complete.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"3 Words For You:  BLOODY MARY BAR!  Saturday and Sunday mornings starting at 11:00 am, they have a fantastic bloody mary bar with every fixin' imaginable (mozzarella whips and pickled cherry peppers...yes please)!  They hand you a generous pour of Titos on the rocks and set you free to mix up your dream concoction!  Bonus is that they're only $4.75 which includes a beer chaser of your choice!  Everything we've had off the menu has also been fantastic...the \"primers\" (prime rib sliders served on a toasted pretzel bun) are scrumptious and their homemade daily soups are truly homemade delicious.    YES it's in a strip mall, YES it's lacking curb appeal, but make it through the front door and you won't be disappointed...outstanding service and fabulous food!"}
{"text":"We tried a half side of st. Louis style ribs with 3 generous sides for $11.95. The ribs were tasty but very fatty which is surprising since we were led to believe they were cooking all day. I think this is more of a burger and sandwich place then full meals. Excellent service and reasonable prices mean I will go back."}
