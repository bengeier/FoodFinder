{"text":"Ordered through Just-Eat.ca because it was open and our usual Chinese takeaway had already closed for the night. Tried orange beef (good), bbq pork fried rice (better), and General Tao chicken (BEST!!). Good value and order came with free chicken wings, which were good, but just plain. Will order again, and next time I'll be sure to get a side of sauce (honey garlic? sweet and sour?) for the wings."}
{"text":"You will not go wrong with their fried chicken wings and the salt and pepper shrimp. Very generous portions and authentic chinese cooking. Great joint for chinese food and also for takeout."}
{"text":"Decent place, we were the only ones in there at the time. Good lunch specials that were generously portioned (my wife got too full to finish hers).   I had the hunan beef and it was very well done, will definitely check out more dishes here"}
{"text":"This place has been in this area for a very very long time , that has to say something for the food quality . Great Canadian style Chinese food, if you are looking for a Chinatown or east end style Chinese restaurant this is not the place, but for old school comfort food than I definitely recommend lucky wok."}
{"text":"Ordered:  LW fried rice, $7.99 LW egg foo tong, $8.65 Général Tao chicken, $10.15 Deep fried chicken wings, $8.75 (x2)  Total:  $50.00 with free chicken fried rice.  YES, the chicken wings were crispy-delicious (Canadianized-Chinese way).  LW egg foo yong was delightfully good.  Both fried rice were typically flavourful.  Général Tao chicken-  not very good, not worth its $10.15 price! Not crispy, just sweet and red. If it was $7, I would not mind. Really similar to sweet-sour chicken without the sour.  Takes credit cards.  Above average CC  (Canadianized-Chinese) Take-out place.  Lunch specials at $5.95."}
{"text":"First time going here, food was pretty much average. Sweet and Sour Chicken balls were good, Lemon chicken sauce had no taste really. Chicken fried rice seemed old and service was alright. $35 for half decent food"}
{"text":"The best fried rice and most friendly service by Sarah. Try the crispy beef as well. :)"}
{"text":"Very English Chinese food. Really love the chicken wings, crispy shredded beef and egg fu Yong. Thanks"}
