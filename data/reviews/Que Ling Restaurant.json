{"text":"Favourite pho place ever. Recommended by a friend, I decided to try it. Ever since it's been my favourite pho place. They also have rice rolls with meat in it. It's amazing! Their pho prices are good and beats other restaurants. Their pho is also amazing. The pho broth is amazing. The restaurant gets packed around lunch time and they may have alittle wait but it's totally worth it! If your in the area, try this place. There's many pho restaurants in this area but I love Que ling the most."}
{"text":"Good value Vietnamese food. Probably the best in the Chinatown East area. Amazing banh cuon."}
{"text":"We got the Que Ling special pho in size large for $6.67. The broth is amazing here. De-li-cious, authentic, tastes homemade. 

We also ordered spring rolls, they were ok. Tasty but a little dry for my taste. 

The interior is a small cozy shack where you are very close to other patrons. They have a plastic by the door to break the wind and a heater mounted by the doorway. Staff is very friendly in spite of the fact that we didn't speak a word of Cantonese. 

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I think this is the best sit down meal you can get in the city for $10, all in.
The Banh Cuon, soups and noodle bows are tasty and comforting.
It's around the corner from our house and my husband and I like to duck in and out for a quick lunch whenever we can. 
Service is usually speedy since the restaurant is small and they like to turn over the tables quickly.
Take notice if planning to go for dinner: they close at 7pm most days."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for authentic pho in town.  It would have been better if they'd given more herbs for the topping.  Soup base is by far the best one we've tried.   It does not taste like MSG added.
Service was just mediocre tho, no one put on a smiley face to serve customers. Not even smile when customers pay the bill !"}
{"text":"It's a small family run business.
Hot, hearty, cheap. A staple food place
Highlights : rice roll and vietnamese coffee.
Doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pho I've had in the city.  It's a simple place, with a small range of Vietnamese dishes, but it's the taste that keeps me coming back.  When friends decide they want pho and this place isn't an option I cry a little on the inside.

The location itself is small and not fancy.  It's a great place for an informal meal but skip it if you need something visually impressive or fancy.  The bonus is that it's super cheap, $5-10 all in.  It also has hours I haven't entirely figured out yet, I've gotten so far as knowing that if I want pho late, say 8pm, I'm likely out of luck.

To sum up, it's authentic and I've never been disappointed.  My favourite is the pho with rare and cooked beef.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best item here is a rice dumpling, but the pho is awful. Lots of MSG left me very thirsty and they were very light on the meat.

This neighborhood is spoiled by Bach Yen (just on Gerrard) but it was closed.  We won't return."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a long time but never tried it.  Finally decide to swing by to try out their pho.  Ordered house special pho and spring roll.  Spring roll doesn't quite look the part but actually tastes ok.  The wrap is crispy and crunchy and filling tastes quite authentic.  Pho on the other hand left something to be desired.  The broth is clear and fresh alright, but not quite as flavourful as another place nearby.  The portion is fair and I think their pho used combination of chicken and beef.  Bun bo hue is disappointing tho, the broth is too mild, kind of bland, not spicy at all.  It just doesn't taste like traditional bun bo hue I typically had.
The place looks like old and beat up but they are actually busy during lunch time.  Table setting seems a bit weird and they did arrange different customers in a long table.  Service is fast so turnover is high when it's packed.  I really want to like this place as I see this is a family oriented place and the boss seems pretty nice.  But the food just doesn't hit my spot.  They are well known for their banh cuon so perhaps I will try banh cuon next time if I ever visit again."}
{"text":"This place has great pho for under $7. My husband always gets the vermicelli and grilled pork and he loves it. Great food, great price point. Two can dine for $20. The only thing is that they have odd hours, so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Located off the Main Street of Gerrard on a side street and in a converted home so it's definitely different. Came here for lunch and we were seated immediately. Staff speak Vietnamese and Cantonese. Fiancé ordered bamboo shoots and duck noodles in soup - she rates it as good, broth is excellent (she drank a lot of it lol) but bamboo sticks don't seem fresh. Not a deal breaker and still worth trying. I ordered pork chop on rice with fried egg - it was different from what I expected, no tomatoes, two pieces of pork chops (instead of the usual 1 piece) rice texture seemed closer to regular rice than broken rice but it was still ok - overall, it was mediocre but I wouldn't truly recommend it. Next time, I'll try the Pho"}
{"text":"My favourite Pho in this part of the city.  All the dishes are good; we always order Pho, Banh Cuon, and Bun thit nuong."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. It's my neighbourhood go-to. It sucks that they only stay open until 7pm though. 

My regular order is the rice noodles rolls with meat and the bun bo hue (mild)- I like to dip my rice noodles in the bun bo hue soup. Nobody else in Toronto seems to do the rice noodle rolls...

Cash only! Also worth mentioning that for takeout orders, they don't offer small-sized items. For dine-in you can choose small or large."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, fast service. Everything you need out of a pho joint, literally. 

The other stuff on the menu aside from the pho is kind of sketch though. We got the bun bo hue once and it was sort of gross. Jack fruit shake also tasted kind of overripe. Stick to the pho."}
{"text":"My fave pho in town, hands down. I grew up in Toronto and all the pho around town all have that fake universal pho-restaurant taste, which is never like homemade pho. The pho here is flavorful and hearty and tastes like the broth was simmered properly with proper ingredients."}
{"text":"Inexpensive place for Viet food when in Toronto! Their soup base is flavorful. The rice noodle is long and smooth. We got the Bún Riêu and their spicy beef noodle soup in large. There are 2 sizes and lets just say that if you have an appetite, get a large! You wont be disappointed. This place is small and seats around 25ppl or less. They do take out too and this place is Cash only!"}
{"text":"In an area where there's much competition for Vietnamese restaurants, this is by far the best one in East Chinatown. The quality of all their dishes are amazing. They have a small menu but they all deliver. My go to is usually bun bo hue and they do an especially amazing job of banh cuon. 

The service is very quick. However, sometimes I feel a little rushed by the servers.  That might be due to the rush hour and small seating that they want a higher turnover, but it still makes me feel bad...they need to smile a little more. Other than that, this place is top notch. 

P. S.  - they're cash only, make sure you got dollas on ya"}
{"text":"Had been to Que Ling before but only to take out some banh cuon. Went for a Sunday lunch and wasn't disappointed. The pho tai was on point with a healthy portion for under $7. 

Service was quick as to be expected and the restaurant was very clean. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"They have limited amount of options but that's a good thing. I've been coming here for the past 3 years and it never disappoints. The owner Ben is well known in the community and one of the friendliest people. Get Ban Cuon (which they specialize in), Pho or the Bun Rieu."}
{"text":"I love their banh cuon! It seems like a lot of viet restaurants don't serve this dish but of the places I've been to that did, Que Ling is the best so far!"}
{"text":"This place is legit - everything tastes great.

1. Pho Broth is made from scratch nightly, home-made, no use of broth powder. Separate broth made for Chicken, Beef, and Duck. Noodles are cooked perfectly and al-dente. Beef used is high quality - marbled fatty pieces and thickly cut so it doesn't overcook by the time you eat it for the Rare Beef pho.

2. Banh Cuon fresh steamed out of the kitchen. Thin, light, delicious. Fish sauce is mixed right

3. Fried Spring rolls are delicious - thin exterior, crispy, light not soaked in fat. Finely chopped ingredients

4. Vietnamese coffee is delicious here. Chef's pick of the blend that makes a great cup

5. Owner takes great pride in the quality of the food which shows through all the dishes

I personally like this place more than Pho Linh in the west end and definitely is much better than many of the places in Toronto - taste wise and price wise."}
{"text":"Best pho ga available in the city of Toronto!  Hole in the wall place, cash only. The meat rolls are delicious as well, and my girlfriend enjoys the crab vermicelli."}
{"text":"Best authentic Vietnamese food in Toronto.  They make traditional Viet dishes the other pho places don't have, or they don't make them as good.  The people are always friendly and service is always fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Ah, I love hole in the wall restaurants. Que Ling is a hidden gem in Riverdale, right by the high school. It's a great place to get authentic and tasty pho on the east side. The broth, noodles & toppings very flavourful and delicious. Don't let the exterior throw you off (it looks like the restaurant is built upon an old backyard shack/hut - it is a cute and cozy family owned restaurant inside. You feel like you're having some home cooking when you're here; which I like. Just as a couple of notes, the Vietnamese coffee is super potent so make sure you can take caffeine well or don't have it after 3pm (or in the evening before you sleep). Also, the place only takes cash so be mindful and bring cash to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Have I seriously not gotten around to writing a review for this restaurant after all these years?  Our family have been eating at this restaurant since I was a little child.  For some reason the foods have tasted much better than what I recall.  My personal favourites are bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle with soup) and bun rieu (crab meat noodle with soup).  They always arrive fresh, fragrant and so delicious.  I usually order extra cha lua (Vietnamese sausage) on the side to accompany my noodle bowls.  My daughter also loves this restaurant and enjoys the bun bo hue too, by the way you can request for the soup to be not spicy."}
{"text":"This place is known for their pho ga. Their broth is one of the betters one in downtown east side. Their prices for all their dishes is cheaper than most other Vietnamese restaurants as well. They always seem to be busy when I go in and I think prices have something to do with it.

My family and I have been coming here for 10+ years. Their banh cuon is quite good. I only get their phos or banh cuon. I love all the lady chefs in the kitchen and make an effort to bring them cupcakes or sweets since they don't get any part of the tips. This little shack looks like it's falling apart from the outside but any of their noodle in broth dishes are super delicious and comforting. If you get rice or vermicelli, expect it to be only ok. 

Service for us have always been great, but maybe it's because we know all the staff so well. I find that if you are patient and understanding and come across as friendly... any servers would then treat u with the same friendliness. I've seen people speak very rudely to the servers here because their English is limited, and then they wonder why the servers raise their voices back at them. They may not completely understand what you are saying, but they can tell that you are being rude to them. If they mess up your order, just let them know gently and they will fix it. The staff here are great hardworking people.. so treat them with some respect."}
{"text":"Ahhh Que Ling! Literally a hole in the wall though and kinda smelly inside, perhaps not for squeamish diners. It would definitely fit the bill for a \"pho\" shack! However they reportedly serve up one of the city's finer phos. I did not find it to be anything special, broth was rather salty, no special notes of flavour detected in the stock however the accompanying herb plate was full of saw, basil and cilantro-bonus points for that. And the beef is kinda \"scrungy\" looking and suffers from massive shrinkage once submerged in the broth but still tastes okay.

Banh Cuon here is good, the rice rolls are filled with ground pork and mushroom and the wrapping is thin and light. Will prolly venture back at some point, the prices are low across the board and there's always a stream of neighborhood regulars coming in and out."}
{"text":"This viet place is dingy and hard to find. Definition of a hidden gem.

Don't expect great service, instead expect some tasty popular Viet dishes like Pho and Rice Rolls (Bánh cun). 

The Bánh cun there is delicious and made fresh, so expect a wait. But fresh is the only way to have these. If you're hungry, get a Large. For $6.25 you can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pho place in all of the Gta. My fiancé and I come here whenever we can. The people who work here are nice and super efficient. They remember us and are happy to greet us when we walk in. 

We always get the large bahn cuõn with meat, which are so delicious, especially with the sauce. We also get the rare beef pho. A small is a good portion, but we usually get a large each. Because we love their pho that much. The broth is so flavourful and the beef is delicious, too. The bean sprouts and other fixings they give are always fresh. The prices are also great for what you get. We get the large bahn cuõn and two large pho and the bill is under $20."}
{"text":"Best authentic viet food in gta hands down.

Best prices and quality in all of gta - I always eat here when I am in the area. Super friendly service, especially if you speak the local language."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.  I love sketchy holes-in-the-wall that serve authentic grub...but this place....meh....

1. Known for the banh cuon (rice flour rolls with pork and mushroom) this place doesn't deliver the goods.  We saw them grab these from a big tupperware container and throw it into the microwave.  My mom's version destroys these re-heated rolls.  And when I go out to eat, I don't want to eat leftovers, thanks!

2. Bun Bo Hue broth is all wrong -- also likely re-heated since the broth was \"separated\" and \"settled\".  The meat in this dish was chewy (at least the tendon and some other mystery meats).  Pork blood was good though.

3. I thought it would be hard to mess up rice with pork chop and fried egg.  Not at this place!  They do use broken rice (+1), but the rice had a distinct smell of \"not-so-fresh\".  The Chinese have a word for it (\"sook\"?), but I don't know the exact translation to Engrish.  Meat and egg were fairly average.

4. The good?  They have cold tea (actual tea that is cold...not beer!).  This was really nice on a hot day.  

I do like the \"family-ness\" of this place -- with their son watching Sponge Bob and working sewing in the dining room.  However, I can't deny that the food simply wasn't good.

Sidenote: they have weird ass hours.  Most nights, I think they're done around 7pm."}
{"text":"The bun bo hue is good here broth and meat is on point! However, they need serve proper veggies with it...i guess it's less work for them to just use the veggie that goes with pho lol. I also tried the banh cuon and thought it was really weak. It's no where near as good as Pho Linh.

Overall I look forward to coming back  :)"}
{"text":"My go-to Viet place! This place is always packed with people especially during weekends which is a good sign ,right? 
Although East Chinatown is much much smaller compared to the one in downtown, there are a few restaurants where you can still get a decent meal. And Que Ling is one of them!

I have had pho, this spicy beef rice noodles, duck meat rice noodles, and Banh bao. I really enjoyed their Banh bao which is packed with pork filling and a half of hard-boiled egg. But duck meat rice noodles (sorry I don't know the name of this dish) lacked in flavour.  

Overall, very good food, consistent quality, quick and friendly service, and a reasonable price (most items are under $10). I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Nothing like getting yelled at because you finished your meal, asked for your drink which never came and then asked for them to remove it from the bill.

Classy"}
{"text":"Very yummy food, but I only come here if Bach Yen down the street is closed (sorry, but that place is THE best). I usually get pho or bun bo hue. The pho has a really nice broth to it - it's kind of gamey? Very unique and not loaded with MSG like Xe Lua or Pho House. The bun bo hue is not spicy at all, unfortunately, even if you ask for it spicy. Go to Bach Yen for amazingly spicy bun bo hue! But this place is still very good. Be aware, though, it is cash-only.

Kind staff. Once I ran into the owner at Sherbourne and he offered me a ride. Lol."}
{"text":"One of the best \"banh cuon\" in town. Other dishes such as \"bun bo Hue\" and \"bun rieu\" are also tasty! Service might be a bit slow and unattended sometimes."}
{"text":"Must Get the rice noodle rolls! I've been to other places, but none of them top these ones! 

Reasonable priced, amazing portions, great quality food, and friendly service. Washrooms are also very clean! A bonus since this is located in china town. 

Loved the bun! Noodles are nice and soft. Meat is nicely grilled and flavoured. 

Pho soup is very flavourful. Didn't like the noodles very much. Found them a bit hard. 

Server asks if you want cold or hot tea. The cold tea is actually served cold, not like ones with ice in it! Haven't seen this at any other asian places. 

Vietnamese coffee is great! Very potent. 

Cash only! 

My go to Vietnamese place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service. They have all the standard Vietnamese restaurant options. One of the best pho restaurants on the east end in my opinion."}
{"text":"Every now and then, you hear about something that makes you want to go just because you're curious about if what you had heard was true and have to see for yourself. This was what brought me to Que Ling: The stories about how there was this place that made some tasty pho, but also offered to do alterations on your clothes. Yep, you heard correctly, it's a pho stop and a tailor shop all in one. And from what I understand, both are pretty damn good.

Now, I'm not doing a review of a place I've never eaten at. I've had the pho here a few times, and it's always been great. But I've never had them hem a pair of pants or bespoke a shirt for me. But I could if I wanted to, and that's more than you could probably say for most pho places or restaurants in general!

The Pho: Not as large of a serving as I'd usually like, but the soup itself is very good. Tasty, clear broth, and noodles that are perfectly cooked to go along with the thinly sliced beef and onions. Overall flavor was great. Aside from the pho itself, my friends and I also ordered some of the pork stuffed flour rolls and they were a cut above. Good portion, sprinkled with French fried onions and Vietnamese sausage, and fairly priced at $8 or so. 

This particular place is a bit off of where I usually am, so I don't frequent it, but it's definitely not because it's not worthy. The lady who runs it is also a sweetheart, just in case you're more of a service oriented recommendation. 

Worth it. You Should Go!"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, and can be a tight squeeze in here but the pho is great, service is great. It's a quick in and out. The broth in the pho is clear and isn't as salty as other places, which I enjoy, and their crispy spring rolls are really tasty! Gotta order their spring rolls!"}
{"text":"i love this joint.  really down to earth people.  the pho and the broth is minimal but good. less is more.  no funny dry mouth feeling because of the the msg.  tons of bean sprouts and the herbal lettuce stuff.  fast service, most of the times.  the prices are very reasonable.  it's a small place but it's big enough.  just go after lunch.  the menu is not that big which is a good thing."}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese who has been eating Pho for all my life and this place is one of the worst Vietnamese-fake restaurants in town. The broth is full of MSG which can make one feel dizzy if he/she is allergic to it. The bbq meat on rice is not really \"bbq\" but blank as stemmed. Dirty cutlery also. Never come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Definitely authentic!!!

My two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho. The rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever I'm there! And the chicken pho is always flavourful!! mmmm....just thinking of it makes me want some!

My boyfriend is Vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at.

Prices are very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese. Fresh banh cuon, made in-house, reminiscent of what my grandmother used to make. One of the better pho places the city, broth is clear, complex & flavourful. And herbs includes ngo gai which is rarely present in most restaurants, but a must. Small menu, cash only."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Vietnamese place I've been to.  My parents actually really like going here and my dad regularly eats the blood jello dish, which is literally blood that's thickened into a jello consistency served with peanuts, fish sauce and coriander/cilantro.  I don't touch that stuff though.

I've never been to Vietnam but I'd imagine that they'd have little pho shops like this all over the place.  The owners actually speak Vietnamese and not Chinese. (Actually, they speak really poor Chinese too - I just remembered that).

The pho is just regular, nothing special.  My mom likes that she can order half pho rice noodles and half regular flour noodles and she raves about the chicken broth pho here - again, I think it's just okay.  Maybe she likes it because it kind of tastes like her rendition of these dishes.

They also make the \"banh cuon\" dish, which is a rice flour roll with pork/mushrooms inside and it's not like steamed in a steamer, but are made by having a boiling pot of water and a stretched fabric over-top and cooking the rice flour and water on top of the fabric and then hand rolling it.  My dad buys these for take out and they taste really good even after bringing it home, but I feel gross if I eat the whole box.

If you want a truly authentic Vietnamese place to go to - this is it, but if you're looking for taste, ambiance, decor, cleanliness or some kind of excellent service... you're better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Walking through Broadview Chinatown brings back so many memories as much of my childhood was spent here where I lived.  Over the years the area has gentrified with the old Asian stores and restaurants replaced slowly but surely by more hip and modern establishments.  

Que Ling still has that old school vibe as its a family run joint located in an old house just off Gerrard Street.  Here they serve simple Vietnamese fare from pho noodles, vermicelli and rice dishes but the real reason you must come is for their every so popular Banh Cuon aka Rice Rolls.

A thin crepe like sheet made from rice flour that is wrapped with a filling of ground pork and wood ear mushroom.  These ever so delectable rolls are served with slices of cha lua (vietnamese ham) topped with fried shallots and dipped in nuoc cham (fish sauce).  If you are only eating one thing, this is well worth the trip down here.  I've yet to find a place in the GTA that serves this better.

All the other dishes here are very good too but the stand out is the Banh Cuon.  Price point everything is in the $7-$10 range so this place offers excellent value with the portions on the average size.  The place is very small so will be slammed during lunch and dinner rush.

Solid 4/5.  For the Banh Cuon alone they are a 5+!! Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Banh Coun in town.  Always fresh and hot with little oil.  Served up with fried chicken sausage and ice berg lettuce + cilantro.  Their bamboo duck noodle soup is also tops."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant in which the floral store (located right next door) has nicer flowers than the interior decor and the random people on the street would more likely give you a smile than the waitresses. My mom once asked the waitress, \"just wondering when we can expect to get our coffee,\" in which the waitress responded with, \"we didn't make it yet because you just ordered it.\" Well, we ordered it 10 mins ago. None of that matters because you came here for the food and that is all you can expect.

Go for: Vietnamese steam rolls (i.e. banh cuon), OK pho, cheapest and best (for the price) Vietnamese food you'll find anywhere

Don't go for: a \"thank you\" or a \"please come again\" or a \"hello\""}
{"text":"Pros:
- Everything tasted fresh and great
- Good prices
- Our food came out quick

Cons:
- Place was a little dingy 

Ordered:
$7.10 Banh Cuon Thit (L)

Conclusion:
Been here a couple times and its never disappointed. It's one of the few places you can get authentic Vietnamese rice noodle roll. The place is a bit of a hole in the wall but I guess it adds to the charm. The food came out relatively quick considering the place a mostly full. It came out fresh and tasted similar to the rolls I've had in Vietnam. I'd recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"What a bargain! You can't get viet food at this price any where else. 

We ordered spring rolls, banh Cuong and bun bo hue with a durian milk shake. The bill was $22!!!! I liked the texture of the banh Cuong, it was smooth and soft however I wish there was a bit more filling inside. My husband's bun bo hue was very flavourful and tasty but we noticed there wasn't a lot of meat. I really liked the springs rolls because there was a lot more veggies than meat but to each its own. The durian milkshake was more on the icy side then smoothy side which would have been my preference. 

This place is really small and a bit dirty so despite the value, I won't be making a trip just to eat here but if you are in the neighbourhood, it's worth dropping in."}
{"text":"Think I've found my new go-to take out pho place. The Mien Ga here is one of the best I've tried. Really rich and flavourful broth, fresh and springy noodles and a variety of toppings. Excellent price as well!"}
{"text":"The minced crab meat vermicelli is something that you do not normally see at a view restaurant. Very home made feel and done very well. Can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu.


P.s. The steam rolls (viet steam rolls with meat) as an appetizers is a MUST!!!!"}
{"text":"For an east end Viet restaurant, this place really is one of the best in the area. The storefront is very unassuming, and unless you are looking for it specifically, you might just pass it by. I haven't been back in ages, but decided to visit again and try it out. 

As with most Pho places, don't judge a book by it's cover. The plastic wind flaps at the front door, dated decor, and small tables should not deter you. Food is pretty fantastic!

The Banh Cuon (steamed rice rolls) is one of their specialties, so we ordered a large plate. Their rolls were filled with pork and mushroom, and the rice roll itself was nice and thin. Comes with the standard cha lua, but the dish itself is easily one of the best in Toronto. 

Also ordered The Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef Noodle Soup), a northern dish - extra spicy. Their broth is very authentic, using a mixed pork/ beef base. Definitely one of the better dishes in the area as well, although I wish they would give you more herbs instead of just lettuce and bean sprouts. 

It's definitely the spot to go if you are looking cheap, authentic Viet food. I will be back to try the bun rieu cua ( crab noodle soup) soon!."}
{"text":"actual rating 3.5

I went here for lunch a second time today.  Last time was better.  This time it took quite a while to get our order.  As always when I have Vietnamese food, I ordered the Bun.  I am not a huge fan of their noodles here; they are a little too thick.  And the meat that comes on the Bun has very little flavour.  The spring roll is decent, but nothing to rave about.

But the people are nice.  And the place itself is kind of cute in a sketchy way.  And it's a very cheap lunch, so it's hard to be too fussy."}
{"text":"Best pho ga and  banh cuon in the city. No lie....also  the owners are the sweetest! Just go eat there and you won't regret it. THE HUT FOR LIFE! Riverside!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked at 9:15am this morning, and they welcomed us in even though they're just prepping to be open. We were initially waiting for another brunch place to open, but we wandered in to Que Ling for their Vietnamese steamed rice rolls. 

Their rice rolls come in large ($6.25) or small ($5.31). It's really good, and economical. The delicate rice rolls are stuffed with minced meat then steamed to perfect goodness. It's paired with a dipping sauce composed of fish sauce, garlic and chillies. It's our go to dish at Que Ling when we're craving it.

My husband and I loved the fact that they welcomed us instead of turning us away when they're not really open."}
{"text":"The beef pho at this place was, by far, one of the best I've ever had.
I've been trying different places and this one really caught my attention.
The texture of the broth was silky, smooth. SOOO tasty. The beef was also soft, and not rubbery like many pho places.
It's a Vietnamese place, you can't expect much about service. You go, eat, and get out!
Prices are incredibly cheap. My Small Beef Pho was $5.37.
Place is cash only!
Definitely recommend and will go back!"}
