{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with some family. Service was very good and the environment was welcoming. My salad consisted of about 75% cheese, 25% lettuce. The homemade pasta was excellent, but I didn't find the sauce to be very flavorful. Another person in my party got the chicken parmesan and said it was excellent. Fried dough for dessert was awesome! Overall, I would recommend trying Santos if you are in the area and looking for a cheap and good meal."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start... the food was kind of gross and WAY overpriced, it was basically greasy dinner food quality in an Italian package.  I had the lasagna ($15), which somehow managed to be both over and undercooked.  It was filled with ground beef that tasted so old, bland and low quality.  Though, half of the lasagna had such overcooked, crunchy noodles, i couldn't even cut into it.  I really felt ripped off by your low quality the food tasted vs. what it cost."}
{"text":"This is the family style Italian place I missed while living in Washington, DC. Reasonable prices for great pizza. Fine spot for kids too. The salads won't blow you away, but the pizza was so nice -- not greasy, just the right amount of cheese, good crust."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated based on my experience.  I experienced a perfect storm of poor service and a disappointing dish which left me dissatisfied.   I ordered the broccolini. It was in the specialties section of the menu, which the server indicated was all homemade, and came with a salad and bread.   I started with the fresh bread and a salad with their house Italian dressing. The bread was good but the salad was a handful of iceberg lettuce with some chickpeas, two cherry tomatoes, and drowned in a flavorless dressing that was mostly oil.   Next came the entree. It was a pile of broccoli sitting in an abundance of white sauce through which almost no pasta was visible. The once I got to the pasta it was prepared well but the broccoli was definitely the only thing I could taste on the plate. It was overall very disappointing.   I am careful to rush to judgement on just one experience, especially since others in my party were satisfied with the pizza, rigatoni, and lasagna. I would be willing to give this place another try only because so many others speak so highly of it but I am skeptical about a place that could be so inconsistent as to serve me what they did while doing other dishes as well as others claim."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Santo's after a day of shopping not sure what to expect.  It's located in a little strip mall, which is kind of kitschy, but still nice enough to not be suspect.   We walked in and it seemed obvious that you'd wait to be seated, but no one was at the podium and we stood there kind of awkwardly for at least 5 minutes waiting for the hostess.  Eventually someone seated us, and the dining room was nice, if a little crowded.    We ordered the fried cheese to start and it was absolutely outstanding.  It was pretty inexpensive -- around $5 -- and it came with 3 half slices of fried mozzarella.  The marinara sauce that came with it was really good too.  When it was time to order our entrees, I asked the waitress why it would be $1.50 for cheese on your salad, and she said something about the having to grate it, and that it might be cheaper if both of us wanted cheese on our salads to order a side.  We didn't, so I agreed to pay the $1.50 for the cheese.   I ordered the rigatoni and my boyfriend ordered the cavatelli.    My salad came first and boy was I surprised when I found that my salad was mostly cheese!  I'm not exaggerating when I say mostly.   There were a few pieces of iceberg lettuce, some shredded cabbage, a couple chickpeas, a wedge of tomato, a slice of cucumber and the hugest pile of cheese.   Their cheese are really good, but I never wanted to eat a bunch of shredded cheese with house Italian dressing.  I don't know if something went wrong and they misinterpreted the order, but it was the strangest thing I've ever attempted to eat.  I gave up pretty quickly, and didn't care to send it back so I waited for my entree.  Meanwhile, my boyfriend said the wedding soup was good, but wasn't as hearty as he'd prefer.    When our entrees came, the rigatoni and cavatelli both met our expectations.  The meatballs were tasty and gigantic - almost the size of tennis balls.  The portions are big enough that it was two meals for both of us.   Overall, I'm more than pleased with the pasta dishes, I just found the situation with the salad to be so strange.  The pasta dishes were in the $10 range, and our bill all together was about $50 with an added pizza to go.  We reheated the pizza in the oven for lunch the next day, and it was very very good.   It's pretty inexpensive for an 8-slice \"large\" around $9 for the pizza and then $1.50 or so for the extra toppings.  We liked it, but I think it was better after being reheated in the oven because the cheese was more browned and the crust more crispy.    I would go again, I liked it quite a bit, but I'd have to be in the area.  I didn't find it remarkably better than local Lakewood Italian places.   Overall it was a good experience other than the salad."}
{"text":"Great homemade Italian food. Homemade pasta is great, sandwiches are reasonably priced, but my favorite is the stromboli. Even the small is two meals. It is THE Italian place in the area. Great family dining room and atmosphere. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and Italian cuisine. Portions are generous and the waitresses are very knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We had a small wedding reception in the florence room and everything was just perfect!!! The room fit everyone comfortably and was decorated very nicely. No detail was missed, even down to the menus they had placed at each seat. The food was amazing and everyone enjoyed. Shout out to our server Denise who was nothing but Amazing!!!!! Our appetizer was the white pizza and pizza with red sauce and everyone couldn't get enough. We had the servers serve our cake and everything ran smoothly. Would definitely recommend renting the party room for an event. You will not be disappointed. I was so happy with how our special day turned out!!   Annette is who handles the florence room rentals. She is such an amazing kind hearted person and very easy to work with!   If you going for an everyday lunch or dinner they are awesome as well! I love going for the lunch specials because you definitely get a lot for the money. The salad with the cheese added is the best thing in this world and they have the best ranch dressing than any other restaurant Ive been too! The bread that comes out doesn't look like much but OMG you'll want more!! I love love love this place and I will definitely be going for many more years to come."}
{"text":"The reg pizza is good but a tad expensive"}
{"text":"Veal Francaise.  Yes, many restaurants offer it, but not like this.  My husband is responsible for discovering this, and now we can't eat anywhere else when our travels bring us to this area.  I have had the white pizza and some pasta dishes, and all were very good.  But recently, without hubby, I just had to try the veal francaise.  I don't know how the make the eggy-breadcrumb coating so fluffy, but it is delicious.  It's served in a very wet sauce, which is tasty but maybe too soupy for some.  But the veal was so tender, and the breading so fluffy, that I didn't mind splashing sauce all over my face.  Service was good, but would have been better if we had been offered dessert.  Will definitely be back...for two veal francaise!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Again.  5 star pizza and sandwiches this time. Very nice meatball sub with cheese."}
{"text":"This place got excellent reviews, so when I found out I'd be in the area I thought, why not???  **Below is \"WHY NOT\"  My kids, mother-in-law and I arrived shortly after they opened.  As soon as we walk in we are greeted & seated (YAY!!).  I notice there are only 2 other tables seated before we were and think, this is fabulous.  We are gonna get our food super go go gadget quick...nope!  We did get our drink order really fast, however, getting refills was an issue.  We had to ask almost EVERY time (BOO!!!).  When they offer you bread (it's free), TAKE IT!!  It is delicious and you will WAIT FOREVER to get your food.....yes.....forever!!!  So after we get our drinks we give the young man our order.  We ordered 2 kids meals, two chicken caesar salads & a half order of spaghetti.  And the wait begins.  After about 30 minutes my kids are getting loud with the \"Where is our food\" and \"Did they forget about us comments\" to the point I was getting embarrassed and told them to HUSH!!!!  After about 45 minutes our food FINALLY comes (remember there were just 2 other tables seated ahead of us).    My daughter ordered the chicken nuggets and chips.  It was soooo obvious that the chicken nuggets were purchased from the frozen section of their local supermarket, but she loved them, so whatever.   My son loved his burger and chips.  The chicken on my caesar salad was dry and the salad itself was very overdressed AND they used the parmesan cheese that comes in the shaker bottles that sit on the table in the salad instead of shaved cheese.  My mother-in-law seemed to enjoy her spaghetti and said the chicken on her salad the moist and really good.  Our total bill was $45 without tip.  Too bad the food wasn't as good as the price."}
{"text":"I have joined friends here twice now - and cannot wait until I have my next visit to the Cleveland area to visit them (and family) so I can return to this great, local restaurant. Last night my friend of some 45 years and I ordered the stuffed long hots for an app (2 orders!) and the walleye entree (1 each). The long hots were simply excellent- with just the right amount of heat and superb stuffing - topped with an out-of-this-world homemade red sauce. Our plates were quite clean - when the great wait staff retrieved the dishes.   They said that the chef could not sauté the walleye for me, but, not to worry, the breading was light and the fish VERY flavorful - just what you'd expect from a place close to Lake Erie, the best walleye fishery anywhere.   If you love wonderful food, attentive staff, and a come-as-you-are, comfy setting - this IS a place you should try."}
{"text":"Years ago I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo to go. I got it home and realized the sauce broke. It was greasy and unappealing. Last week I tried again. It was butter, cream and flour. No garlic. No cheese.  Plus, it was cold in the dining room. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little Italian spot in S-ville."}
{"text":"Santo's is seriously the best pizza. I pretty much always get some when I come visit family. I've had other things here as well, and they're good, but the pizza. Also make sure you get a loaf of their bread because it makes the best eggs and toast bread."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  My first visit was yesterday although I have heard from others how good Santo's is.  I will happily return!!!  We were a party of 3 ladies enjoying a girl's afternoon.  Service was friendly and prompt.  A basket of fresh bread they bake in-house was brought to the table.  Two of us enjoyed the salad and we must say the freshly grated mozzarella was a bonus!  The other lady had the wedding soup and she is 100% Italian and said it was one of the best she has ever had.  Could not get over how many meatballs there were!  I had the eggplant parmesan with pasta aglio/olio.  Delicious!  They make their own pasta and it was evident in the first bite.  One friend had their version of Frutti di Mare, aglio/olio, seafood pasta and she said it was excellent.  The other friend had the chicken dish over red pepper pasta and spinach...she loved it.  The frosting on the cake was the limoncello cake we shared.  OMG!!!!!  I am not a sweets person but was happy to help them share this.  Light and refreshing...each bite a burst of fresh lemon with a wonderful lemon cream.  Would absolutely recommend this restaurant and cannot wait until I am in this area again so I can go back!"}
{"text":"Danielle chose to have Santo's for her birthday dinner last night. it was my second time there. for some reason she just wanted pizza for her birthday. hey, her birthday - her choice.  this time i had the Rigatoni with vodka sauce and sausage. it was really good, though i do tire of Italian sausage quickly if it's not in a hoagie bun w/ peppers and onions. the vodka sauce was delicious. i also had a cup of wedding soup. Danielle got a pizza w/ pepperoni and banana peppers. also good. she got a salad w/ house Italian dressing and we shared some calamari. the calamari dipping sauce (marinara) was delicious and i was sopping it up with bread.  our server was prompt though, not unfriendly, was sort of curt (is i guess how i'd describe her). nothing wrong with that. she wasn't mean or unfriendly.  we've had good food each time we go and we'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is hovering on two stars, but I hate to bash a joint I go to infrequently. Last week the wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch; she had the lasagna, I ordered a chicken parm sandwich and we split fried calamari. Everything was bland and needed more of everything. Service was good. Pizza here is ok but it is not anythng I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Made my first trek to Santo's Italian located in a strip mall.  My friends love this place but as I pulled in I found myself wondering the merit of this decision with Cleveland's fab options.  But I have to say when I got back in my car to go home I quietly congratulated myself on my savvy choice.  This is a family business of great Italian cooks who enjoy good food and make everything with love and garlic.  Our waitress was awesome and very enthusiastic about the food she serves and loves.  She was patient and helpful even in the middle of a very busy, Friday night.  She said she has worked there for 2-years and I honestly think she might be their best advertising as she shared lots of dishes I should come back to try on her on list of favorites.  I had the Seafood Chasmondo which my she suggested.  As my server toured the menu for me and asked about my likes I learned two important tips to share:  all the pasta is freshly made on site except for the rigatoni (so I say, why would you order rigatoni!) and if it isn't on the menu just asked and in most cases they can make it for you (and honestly, when do you ever hear a restaurant willing to do that and with a smile!).  My friends have had specials they loved and when they returned the chef would whip it up again just by asking.  In fact, my dish wasn't on the menu but my server recommended it for me and it was excellent.  It started with a generous but not overwhelming bed of homemade red pepper pasta topped with lots (seriously) of fresh scallops and shrimp (not breaded) that had been perfectly cooked in olive oil, garlic and fresh spinach.  Simple but really good.  So much for my plan to bring half home.  I had a decent house red wine and the meal came with a basic iceburg salad that was super fresh and served with their fluffy homemade Italian bread with sesame seeds.    Don't go here being in a rush because this is a place to enjoy your friends and family for conversation (imagine!) while they make your food to your taste.  Not a big wait but despite the Italian diner feel things are not prepared and sitting under heat lamps.   So, for me and mine we'll be back.  Maybe today?  Did I say, today?  Yep.  I've heard that their ravioli is to die for --- very thin pasta made into pillows stuffed with cheese or meat.   Or, the other things on my must have list would be the pizza (they looked fab) or the Noodles Raymondo with broccoli and mushrooms or the..."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch for pick up and was not well pleased.  My lunch was bagged and I paid at a different spot.  When I went back to get my food, I had to wait again as another customer had come in while I was paying.  Once I got my food and went back to my office, I opened my lunch and the salad was not included.  There was no salad and no silverware.  The lunch portion was ok - but the service and the fact part of my order was missing did not sit well."}
{"text":"My wife's family has eaten at Santo's since they opened their doors 35 years ago and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt but the past couple of times we've been there the food has gone downhill. Tonight was the final straw. The only good thing to come out of the entire dinner was the bread and service. Our server Bev was awesome and made sure we were well taken care of. As for the food...terrible.   We ordered a small cheese pizza for our two year old, veal marsala for myself, and eggplant parm for my wife. The pizza came out first and my wife cut some up for our son and noticed there was barely any sauce on it at all. Our son wasn't in the mood to eat so we didn't bother sending it back. Our entrees followed shortly after. I wish I would've snapped a picture of my Marsala when it came out. The mushrooms were not sliced...they were full crimini mushrooms....some rather large mushrooms. I've never seen that before...like ever. So sure no big deal, as long as everything tastes good I'm game. I cut a piece of the veal and it was like melt in your mouth tender but then I tasted it. It was the worst marsala I have ever tasted...way too sweet, it was like I was drinking marsala wine. I sent it back it was that bad. Usually I'll sack up and just finish it but this was inedible. I sent it back and I went with eggplant parm as my replacement. It was just ok and the eggplant was tiny and some pieces didn't even have cheese on them. My wife's eggplant parm had more surface area but looked like it was sliced with a mandolin. So it was basically all breading and you guessed it...hardly any cheese.  The menu is the same as it always was but the quality is just way down. I don't know what's going on with this place but it's a shell of its former self and it's kind of sad because my wife's family and now our own little family has made some nice memories there."}
{"text":"Santo's Pizza, I get the feeling you've been there forever & somehow I never noticed.    Feeling a pizza craving coming on, I had my mom order some 'za.  (Plus, I didn't feel like cooking)  I arrived earlier than I needed to so I did have a bit of a wait.  I didn't mind though because I was able to check the place out and read the menu.    The decor is not anything to write home about....it is totally that old-school family Italian joint w/ the tacky mural on the wall & super old furnishings.  The menu was also you \"typical\" Italian Family restaurant w/ pasta's etc. on it.    The chef felt bad about my wait & offered me a fresh loaf of Italian bread for the inconvenience.    The 'za was great!  Nice, greasy, full of cheese and pepperonis.  My only complaint was a overall lack of sauce.  But hey, next time I'll order extra sauce instead of extra cheese.  The Anti-pasta salad, while not the best I've ever had, was not half bad and it filled my need.  Santo's, I like you.  Thank you for being the mom 'n pop joint you are.  I will visit you again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The sauce is just like i remember growing up at my grandparents house on Sunday!  I would give 10 stars if i could!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place. Every time we come in town we have to stop. Stopped in Saturday evening around 8:00 pm and was seated right away. Took a few mins for the waitress to come and get our drink order but after that we had no issues.   I ordered the manicotti which is my favorite thing on the menu. My husband and his brother both got the chicken Parmesan and they just raved about it. The amount of food you get is a really good portion. And don't forget their salads with the fresh cheese piled on top and the poppyseed dressing - a perfect way to start your meal."}
{"text":"Just wasn't good. From the terrible service (waitress was extremely rude), to the salad drowned in some odd flavored dressing, to the broccolini, which was flavorless and gooey... I would not recommend it.   Surprisingly, I have been here before. About a year ago, I would say their good was good... They must have changed chefs because it was rough."}
{"text":"Ate there last night with family after the remodeling show. Arrived just after 8 o'clock and waited only a few minutes. Enjoyed the Pinot Noir they introduced at their tasting this week. Wait person was helpful, positive and friendly.  Had a white pizza with salad and ranch dressing plus cannoli for dessert. I liked it all very much. Didn't try the bread but the folks at our table said it was yummy! I would go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Santo's is another little hole in the wall pizza place that you could easily drive right past unless you know it's there.  Luckily, my family has been coming here for some time, and we've never been disappointed.  Don't be discouraged by the appearance... it is very casual and has not had a makeover in awhile... It's worth it!    The bread that you start with is delicious (we have, on occasion, been known to stop in just to buy a loaf or two).  The wedding soup is flavorful and the perfect start to any meal, and any meal is delicious.  The most recent time we went, I opted for the fettucine alfredo with grilled chicken breast on top.  The sauce was flavorful and not too heavy, and I kept eating and eating it even though I was already full (oops!)    I have had their pizza (delicious), mannicotti (yum), and all kinds of pasta before (also good) and enjoyed everything.  The service varies (the last time I went, the waitress was not at all friendly), but that's to be expected most places."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this wonderful restaurant. This has been my family's go to Italian restaurant for YEARS. Santo's a a family owned Italian restaurant that is one of the best in the area.   All of the waitresses are attentive and know the menu well - I have never had a complaint or an issue with the service.   The inside is bright and romantic with a lovely Italian mural and stone work on the wall. You definitely feel like you're walking into your long-lost Italian grandmothers home.   Most of the pasta is homemade, and the bread is to die for! You can even just stop in and pick up a loaf on the way home from work. The bread is soft and freshly baked - always wonderful and some of the best.   If you want to save a LOT of money but still try the great food - go at lunch! The portions are a little smaller and it's much cheaper. They're always pretty busy for lunch because it's so delicious, but the service is always great regardless. I highly recommend the chicken parm with spaghetti."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner here last night.   I have to say it's been about 10 years since I've eaten here.  Not due to any particular reason, just because I always forget about the place.  Daughter  and I both had lasagna,. The food was absolutely wonderful. Cheesy, lots of sauce, cooked to perfection.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and like it a lot. The pasta dishes are great, as is the pizza.   Service is usually adequate, although there is one waitress who is very rude, OFTEN, and seems a bit crazy!   I have ordered the chicken parm many times, but it is a huge serving, and the chicken is always cut way too thick.   The home made bread, and the home made ranch dressing are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in the Cleveland area for Italian food. I have been numerous times with my family because I grew up in the Berea, OH.   We typically always start our meal off with some Garlic Bread with Cheese because my husband and brother-in-law love it. I gotta say it is some really good garlic bread. We usually always have a pizza of some sort and you can't go wrong with any of the options they offer. The Italian Salad is huge and comes with plenty of toppings to keep you satisfied. You could easily share this between two people or more depending on how much salad you actually want. My other favorite food option is the The Sub Sandwich which I get hot with Italian dressing. They give you plenty of sandwich for your money.     Serve is slower then normal places but with how good the food is you would not mind. The serves are always very friendly and helpful.  If you are trying to go on Friday evenings during dinner rush you will probably wait a little since they are normally packed. Also parking can get a little crazy during this time as well."}
{"text":"Nice local Italian restaurant. Nothing too fancy, very casual (a little too casual in terms of customers' apparel). I got a dinner salad and the lasagna. The prices were a little steep in my opinion, considering the casual atmosphere. Both the salad and the lasagna were average. The waitress we had was a bit rude, and it took her forever to get to us. Another table was sat after us, ordered after us, but got their food before we did. Overall, it is a decent local Italian restaurant, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Brought back many memories of growing up in Cleveland! The food is just as good as it was back then. Same location. They have grown and bought the adjacent place for private parties. Pizza has always been great! Chicken Parmesan, rigatoni, potatoes and green beans. All excellent."}
{"text":"We were here with a party 12.  The food was OK. The pizza not so great.  I would say it was average overall, but I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Had the White Pizza (awesome), Chicken Raymondo (excellent), Italian Salad, and fried zucchini appetizer.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting pizza or Italian dishes.  Enough said."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to eating dinner here ,  He grew up in the area and raved about the food.so we stopped in.  Very disappointed.  Way to much cheese on the salad, the veal parmesan with a side of spaghetti was fair and the spaghetti tasted like it was reheated.  I had the Seafood Manicotti  with the alfredo sauce.  The sauce was the texture of glue and where was the seafood?  Tiny bits of shrimp & scallops that I had to dig to find in the thick sauce.   We will be frequenting the area for the next few months but I do not know if we will be back."}
{"text":"Just great simple Italian-American fare."}
{"text":"Definitely above average. For Italian places in the area, I'd have to give it a 2nd place rating behind Antonio's.  Both the pizza and pasta are good here. For the pizza, I've enjoyed extra cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, and sausage, and all have been great. Some of the pasta dishes come a little heavy on the sauce, but honestly, I'd rather have too much, than not enough. The garlic bread is pretty good, as well.  Worth a try if you're in the mood for Italian and haven't given it a try yet."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've been here a few times. We've ate there and picked up to go orders. Pizza, salad, soup, rigatoni, meatballs, no matter what we order, it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. It's a litle on the expensive side if you add on all the toppings but it's so good!"}
{"text":"Ventured into Santo's while waiting across the street for some auto work.  It had been years since I have been here and I was only here once so it was good to come back.  Walking in the décor is pleasing...Flagstone archways and a nice Mediterranean painting on the far side. We were quickly seated and I felt bad as I was using my girls phone to try and locate mine...the waitress put up with my shenanigan and did her job dutifully. As briefly as I was glancing over the menu, it did seem a bit over priced however as we were there early items were priced a few dollars cheaper.  I decided upon Eggplant parmesan and my partner picked manicotti one alfredo and one red.  We also were given Italian wedding soup as well as New England clam chowder. The Soups were fantastic.  The Italian wedding was light, and not oily and fresh tasting.  The chowder had either prosciutto or bacon/ham in it and gave it a unique flavor...I really enjoyed it despite having a thinner consistency than what I usually seek out. The food was brought out fairly quickly...but not before we had a chance to eat some fresh thin cut Italian bread which was fantastic!  On to the entrée...at first glance mine lacked presentation however taste was ok.  It looked as if it were cut and breaded by and amateur, no finesse in display for delight.  The red sauce the eggplant was in was unflavored and just appeared to be sauce...Made me wish I had my homemade sauce on it! (Which I assure you is the best anywhere...challenge me on it, and I will take you up on it!)  The cheese was good.  My spaghetti was ok, nothing glamorous and nothing bad. My girls dish had noticeably more red, robust sauce...I thought it was meat based however the server said it was not although they cook their sauce with bones (it's got to be the bones!).  It was better than the sauce that came with my eggplant parmesan.    We finished quickly as we had to return to look for my phone...but overall it was ok.  If the main dish had some more pizzazz perhaps the rating could of been a bit higher...It was good, but I am not over this way often and don't see myself coming back, although who knows, I often do get oil changes across the street"}
{"text":"Go for the pizza I had no complaint . The spaghetti and meatballs were not very good, not  sure if meatballs were homemade or not. I specifically asked for the spaghetti noodles to be firm and not mushy but they served them mushy anyway. Very disappointing  when you drive out of your way 15 minutes or so for carryout. You wonder if they even taste the food they serve. They must need restaurant rescue!"}
{"text":"First I want to say we've always had a very good experience here, but yesterday was a complete flop.  My wife had the sauteed veal which was ok but in a puddle of oil.  On a bed of very lackluster spinach. Her side of angel hair was invisible under a huge mound of what tasted like old sauce. She said she never had a sauce here like this.  Our friend and I had the shrimp and scallop alfredo. Scallop and shrimp were tasty, but you couldn't see any of them or the noodles, because again covered with a mountain of incredibly thick alfredo sauce that would stand high on the fork like sludge.   We are hoping that something was really haywire in the kitchen and that they correct this. This is a great family. We'll try again and see what happens."}
{"text":"What a find!  After a long day of driving (over 500 miles), we decided to stop for dinner in Middleburg Hts. We saw plenty of chain restaurants in the area, but we wanted to try some local Italian. We decided on Santo's Italian Restaurant, located in the middle of a long strip plaza (Pearl Rd at Fowles Rd).  We arrived here around 9:10PM and we were seated immediately in the cozy dining room. The Italian menu offerings include pizza, strombolis, sandwiches, salads, soups, homemade pasta, baked pasta dishes, poultry, seafood, veal, and desserts. Dinners come with soup or salad and bread. See the menu at http://www.santospizzaandpasta.com/menu.htm Pepsi fountain drinks, beer, and wine (list) offered.  We started out with some drinks, a coffee ($2.29) and a Sierra Mist ($2.29) and some bread  & butter was brought out. The coffee was good. Next, the salad served on a glass plate was a standard mix of iceberg, carrot, red cabbage, tomato, and a tangy Italian dressing. The cup of Italian Wedding Soup was very good and had meatballs, spinach, small pasta, in a good chicken broth.  For dinner, the Spaghetti with Sausage ($10.50) had a good amount of soft homemade spaghetti topped with a hearty marinara sauce and chunks of Italian sausage slices. The Lasagna ($13.45) was served in very hot casserole dish with around 10 layers of firm noodles, cheeses, ground meat, and topped with a thick layer of melted mozzarella cheese and plenty of hearty marinara sauce. The portions were good sized and the Lasagna was boxed up to go, plus the bread was also wrapped in foil to go. We passed on the desserts.  Overall, Santo's Italian Restaurant was an excellent choice for a quiet Italian dinner with great food at a very fair price. I would give this place 4.5 stars and I'm rounding up because the service was spot on and very prompt.   Our waitress was very attentive and we were also given several complementary refills on the drinks. I enjoyed 3 ice cold Sierra Mists to wash down my meal. We stayed here right up until the 10PM closing time. Yet another strip plaza gem!"}
{"text":"Authentic Sicilian Italian-American restaurant. Everything was very good and the atmosphere is what I expected from an authentic Italian place. We got a pepperoni pie, white pizza, spaghetti and meatballs and the wonderfully prepared Broccolini. All the dishes were prepared deliciously and we couldn't have asked for a better meal. Why would anyone go to the big chains when this is easily accessible and we didn't have to wait to get a table. Our server, Jessica was perfect and was attentive to our table. But let me tell ya, the bread was perfect. Heavy but not too heavy and perfectly fresh all served with real butter. I am from Savannah and I would love to have Santo's closer. Thank you for serving the real deal. Bene!!!!!"}
{"text":"Use to work here and fell in love with the wedding soup & bread then. Still go back now every time I come into town. Fresh home make pasta, fresh bread & home made soup can't be beat.  I prefer the chicken santo and my husband likes the sausage vodka sauce over penne.  The dessert comes from local bakery. And when paired with the moscato makes for an amazing finish to the meal.   Can be a little pricey but you are getting fresh food and supporting more than one local business.  Must stop! Please don't be put off by location or you will miss out"}
{"text":"Love this place! Old style mom and pop Italian restaurant ambiance.  The entire family likes stuff on the menu, one of the kids is picky too.  I always get the lasagna!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum YUUUMMM!! I love this place. My second time here. I come for the stromboli. It is so darn good! A crispy dough, filled with homemade sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella and ricotta. It's to die for! My fiance gets other entrees and he has asked both times, \"Why don't I order the stromboli??\" To be fair his veil parmigiana was great!  Our waitress was excellent and super nice, and even though the foursome next to us were pompous a-holes, she couldn't have been sweeter! I will go back here on every trip to Strongsville!"}
{"text":"the lunch menu is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive .. saw a lot of complaints about too much cheese on salads .. how about sending it back to be re-made by removing the cheese or adding just \"light\" cheese .. the service here I have always found to be more than accomodating if you are not happy w/your food .. the pizza is also wonderful .. I have never had anything but freshly prepared & deliciously tasting food here accompanied with great service .. repeat customer for sure"}
{"text":"Just made my last visit to what used to be a very good restaurant. The only thing hot on our 4 plates was the fish, the vegetables and fries were cold as though they plated before the fish and sat there waiting under a cold draft. The two stars are for the always delicious hot stuffed pepper appetizer we love. Might have to back just for that alone......"}
{"text":"Santo's used to be TEN STARS until the kids took over and then decided to let THEIR kids take over. Fettucini with vodka sauce, alfredo, meat ravioli and white pizza are their staples along with wedding soup and the fresh bread. Service has gone down hill along with the food - comparably - from where they used to be. Unfortunate, but true. I know I'm not the only one that feels like this so...santos take note.  I have been going here for the entirety of my nearly 30-year life so please step it up."}
{"text":"Santo's ended up being a slice above the typical Italian Mom and Pop Family restaurant (hooo ! bad pun !).   Set in the middle of a strip mall, rests the restaurant with pictures of random Italian families from the early 20th century on the walls. Parking was limited compared to a typical strip mall.   I had the Gnocchi, [a daily special otherwise not on the menu] which came with a soup or salad for $13. I opted for the wedding soup which had lot of spinach in it, didn't taste salty, and only had one meatball (which I preferred). Its sauce was rich in flavor (a hint of a spice in there) and dense texture, unlike other mom-and-pop family style Italian restaurants' sauces. Most gnocchi that I have had are soggy with a limp outer shell and are hard on the inside: these fortunately were not; they were fluffy dumplings of goodness, cooked evenly throughout.  Although they were crowded, the service was excellent. The Italian bread was fresh and you could see them baking it in the front. This is probably the best experience that I've had a mom and pop Italian restaurant in Northeast Ohio. Very High 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here after leaving dealership...place was packed but we got seated quickly. Needless to say,food was fantastic! And the spumoni is a must..."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 3, versus 2 or lower, only because we love the food.  The service, at times, leaves a lot to be desired. We frequent this restaurant quite a bit, as its my husband's favorite. However, depending on who's on duty, the service is sometimes quite questionable. Just yesterday, Sunday, May 29, the restaurant was half empty, yet when I told the young lady with the single braid down her back that there were 6 of us and no, we did not, \"call ahead\", she huffed at me and seated us (right away, as there were plenty of empty tables!). She obviously was not happy to be there, as she was making all sorts of annoying, clanking sounds every time she had a table to bus. She did not offer us beverages but we noticed she did to other tables she seated after us. It took forever to get service, beverages, food, and refills.  Other days, we've had excellent service. Hopefully, yesterday was a glitch."}
{"text":"Really went downhill since our last visit. The meatballs were not as meaty and they were full of onions. We went late at night and it seemed as though the spaghetti sauce was watered down. We actually had to send our spaghetti back to the kitchen to be drained and the new sauce watery too.   Our waiter Jeremy forgot the cheese for our salad and he was generally inattentive. We will not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Pizza is wonderful, although the prices keeps on escalating. Pasta dinners are good and the atmosphere is fun and kitschy. Its a small place but you won't have trouble getting a table if you are willing to wait a few minutes. A classic Italian-American family place. Nothing fancy but always delicious."}
{"text":"Food was different than what I'm used to, but it was okay. Wedding soup was too greasy!? Prob olive oil but kids wouldn't eat it and that is their all time fave, so very disappointing there. Friendly and fast service. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"2/25/2018 Came in for dinner, 15 min wait as there were a few larger parties dining in. Got seated, servers all looked MISERABLE! The young girl that was, I guess the hostess, looked lost.  Ordered garlic bread and wedding soup for starters, well the salads came out rather quickly, great. But the entrees, the appetizer and soup all came out at once! Ridiculous! Soup was gross when typically it is my favorite wedding soup. It became cold as we felt rushed to eat everything because again, it ALL came out together. It was blamed on the kitchen....whatever.  Been coming here for years and recommend it to all friends and family but this experience was hands down the worst.  Maybe coming for lunch is a better idea. One let comment, why so much dang cheese on a tiny salad and charge way too much. Cheese should come with it and if you don't want it, say no cheese. Cheese overload! People around were complaining it was taking a long time for food, that it was chilly in the restaurant. Just an off night apparently. But smiles for servers would be best. Just looked like everyone was miserable and couldn't wait to be done with their shifts."}
{"text":"I have eaten here four times. Each time it go better.  My first ti.e here I had the lasagna. It was overcooked, the noodles we're dry, and it lacked flavor and moisture. I was not impressed.  The next time I had the lasagna again (I am a lasagna freak). It was better but still average.   The third time that I had the lasagna it was moist, saucy, full of ricotta and flavorful. My opinion had changed and was a fan.  Today at work we had a meal catered. It included lasagna, Boneless fried chicken, roasted red potatoes and linguini Alfredo. I had everything but the Alfredo. The lasagna was excellent! The chicken was moist and mouthwatering. The potatoes were very good.  I'm guessing they may have changed chefs as my first two visits were ok, my last two visits were excellent.   I am now a fan."}
{"text":"It's the best damn dough ANYWHERE!   A full menu with all the amazing family recipes but a traditional crust pizza with pepperoni and sausage reminds you what pizza should be!"}
{"text":"I am an Italian-American, and during high school I worked in this restaurant as a hostess, where I have memories of people lining up out the door to eat at this amazing restaurant. They keep the food the main focus, and the family are manning the stoves. Several years later, as an adult living in Los Angeles, and as someone who has tried several Italian restaurants in all the major US cities, I still have fond memories of the cuisine like it was yesterday. Anything on the menu is amazing and tastes just like my family would make. My favorite dish is the Chicken Marsala. But if you're in the mood for pizza, try the white pizza! Delizioso!!"}
{"text":"Wow. People really like this place. I'd say it's OK--I defintely wouldn't rave about it. My in-laws RAVE about the bread, and quite frankly it's just white bread. The food has always been decent, again, nothing to rave about. Their wine choices aren't anything to write home about either. Ambiance is nice, bu you can definitely tell this place is in a strip mall. That being said, people LOVE this place so it gets crowded for every meal.   I will say their service stands out. The servers are soooooo nice. You really feel welcomed when you walk in the door. Good casual neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Santo's is the best Italian restaurant in town. Excellent pizza, authentic homemade pastas and sauce, wonderful appetizers and salads. If you want a real treat, check out their wine dinners held in the private Florence Room next door!  They are wonderful and accomodating with private parties- rehearsal dinners, anniversaries, birthdays, showers, etc. Their staff is really great, too... most of the waitresses have been employed there for 5 years or more."}
{"text":"They make all their own fresh Italian bread, and all homemade pasta.  It is absolutely fantastic.   Rigatoni with meatballs were delicious.  But best of all was the eggplant parmesan cooked to perfection, and the best I've ever had.  Cheesy and crisp. The house salad was just okay.  If you go for lunch, they have half portions for 8.95.  Dinners cost 10 to 15 dollars. Favorite new Italian place in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"My friend and I really enjoyed our meals at Santo's.  Feels  like a neighborhood Italian family restaurant. I had Chicken Chasmondo and my friend had eggplant parmigiana.  The serving sizes were plentiful and the food was fresh and delicious.  Nice house wine too with generous pours.  Their service was great from the moment we stepped through the door.  Should have taken a photo of my meal / Lightly breaded chicken breast filets over spinach over red pepper flake fresh pasta and olive oil.  Entree with salad $14.95"}
{"text":"We are out of towners visiting relatives.  This was our second time here, one of our relatives enjoys this place and he was treating so...  I like the laid back atmosphere here and no big rush to push us out the door either even when they got busier.  I ordered the clam on pasta with garlic butter sauce.  Although the dish was pretty tasty, it was dripping with grease.  Hope it was olive oil since I know THAT is good for you, ha, ha!  The antipasto salad was pretty good and the service was fine."}
