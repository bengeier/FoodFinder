{"text":"Fact about Toronto:  You want excellent Greek food, you go to the Danforth.  Most of the places there are family-run, non-franchised, and like most other ethnic restaurants, you can tell the really good Greek places by the number of Greek people eating in them.  Typically, these places are small, quaint, and decently plain with the focus on the food, and run by animated moms-and-pops.  The more upscale, the more the place seems to be trying to hard to impress.  Myth sort of brings that to the table.  Myth is definitely more upscale and attempts to be trendy and at the moment.  Exactly what you want for good Greek food.  I could care less about strobe lights.  How about a good saganaki?  You do see some Greek clientele, typically in a younger demographic that will take the club-style lighting and the music that permeates the interior.  So, it's either the food that's good or the ambiance that they are there to handle.  The food is okay with some surprises.  For example:  What the hell is spaghetti and pizza doing on a Greek restaurant's menu?  Not being ordered by me, that's what.  I think the target for this restaurant definitely slants to the younger crowd, more looking to impress someone with a chic surrounding instead of superior food.  If that's what you're looking for, by all means have at it.  I prefer being yelled at by a Greek mother for not finishing my souvlaki."}

{"text":"I thought this place was really, really lame. First off, I really hate going to anywhere called a \"Lounge\". Myth calls itself that.  I also hate places that try and make their food sound fancier than it actually is, by using a thesaurus and a cooking dictionary, but not actually changing the way they cook the food at all. Myth does that, too.  Not a fan of a meal costing me $22 when every other restaurant on the strip is closer to the $12 region. And that's what happened at Myth.  Basically, Myth is trying to be an upscale Greek restaurant, which I'm sure there's a market for, but is something I do not want to be a part of. Especially not when the food is mediocre and the service sucks. I've never waited so long for a waiter to come by in my life, and since we were the only group in the restaurant, they really had no excuse.  There are SO SO SO many good Greek restaurants on the Danforth. Don't waste your money here."}
