{"text":"I got the spicy chicken with \"extra\" vegetables, a total ripoff and the chicken was grey! 7 dollars I will never be spending again let alone a cent going back here."}
{"text":"You can find this place on the 2nd floor food court in the Sunlife building.  If you need something to warm you up I highly recommend their beef noodle soup, always does the trick.  It is a huge portion and very inexpensive for downtown, around $6.  Tons of noodles, veggies and ground beef with a delicious broth.  Can't say I have tried anything else here, always go for the soup."}
{"text":"Sometimes when it's -30 with windchill a girl needs some hot spicy soup and let me tell you...... today was that day!   I will begin by telling you, dear reader that I have a very special spot in my heart for wontons. I don't know why but when you throw those little dumplings into a dish it just makes everything better. That being said I read on the menu at Shoguns that they have a variety of noodle soups and Wonton soup was one of them, so I decided to try it.  Holy noodle heaven! Is my first reaction. It is filled with 7 (or 8 I lost count) plump wontons, oddles of udon noddles and a lot of veggies. I added about 8 tbsp's of hot sauce because I love the heat so to me it's quite flavorful but can be salty. The portion is defiantly great for the price.  I haven't tried anything else from here but I am loving their noodle soup and will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Actually a 3.5 rating. I got the spicy chicken on rice ($7.38). Great value for the quantity of food you get. It tasted different from other spicy chicken dishes I have eaten, but in a good way!  It is just a small store in the building, beside a few other stores. Decided to give it a shot because I tend to like spicy food and for the price, you can't really go wrong.  Overall, I would recommend this to a friend!"}
{"text":"I like the place, the food and service. It's a food court, not a 5 star restaurant. Food is always freshly made, quick, they remember my special orders every time. I get a hello or nod and smile each time I'm there regardless of how busy.   I will take it every time over your chains."}
