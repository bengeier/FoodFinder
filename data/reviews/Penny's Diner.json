{"text":"Used to be Tom's/Follinos, but they changed in the last year and redid the decor to look much nicer and have a more homey feel.

Having a sweet tooth like I do, I nearly always go for the breakfast or desert menu and rarely really touch the regular stuff.  The breakfast selection, like any good diet, is available all day with a big selection of pancakes, french toast, eggs, waffles and meats.  I like the chocolate chip pancakes myself.

If you want to destroy your teeth and your diet, ask if they have the chocolate tower cake.  It's a huge pile of chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and chocolate icing, covered in chocolate shavings.  One slice will easily feed four people and send each and every one into a diabetic coma.

The food is good, though not entirely amazing.  It's not something I crave, but it is a place I'll stop by if I'm hungry and not in the mood for some of the more specific or expensive items you can find on the South Side.

Great for large groups.  Groups I attend meet here regularly and the waitstaff is always incredibly friendly, even when we take over the majority of the place with a group of fifty (very loud, often large) people or more.  They're probably the best part of this place because they know the menu and if you come often enough they will get to know your order.

This place is my comfort food in Pittsburgh when I'm on the South Side, though the best part of it is definitely the wait staff."}
{"text":"I ate here when it was Tom's. I eat here now that it's Penny's. The food quality is not as good as it used to be, and some of the prices have gone up, but it's still basically what you'd expect from a diner in the SouthSide. I eat there about once every other week, and plan to do so for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"Tom's Diner is now Penny's Diner.  Penny is Tom's daughter.  I figured that Tom's didn't offend me enough to walk out of Penny's, and I didn't know just how different the food could be.  Still the same decor and the same servers as before.  The only real difference is the name and the caricatures of Penny's face -- they make her look like Penny Marshall.

On our order for the night:

Wedding-same
Buffalo chicken (regular or hot)
Grilled cheese-cheeseburger with homemade fries
Hot pot roast sandwich with mash and gravy

Our experience was very similar and the food was also similar.  The wedding soup was still good, nothing spectacular.  The Buffalo chicken strips have gotten better as has the sauce.  I prefer the hot over the mild.  I was talked into getting the Grilled Cheese-Cheeseburger by our waitress and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually palatable.  I would never have thought to make such a sandwich, but the beef patty was moist and tasted good between the two grilled cheese sandwiches.  The fries were also very good.   I did enjoy dipping them in my friend's brown gravy.  The pot roast sandwich was nothing too special and we will probably not get it again.

Overall, I would say there was a slight improvement with the change in name.  Enough of a change in the food to make me bump up my rating."}
{"text":"I've been to Penny's twice now, and both times enjoyed the experience. Penny's comes from the Tom's Diner family, so I expected Tom's Diner type food, but I was pleasantly surprised to see different kinds of food, and a much bigger menu then you normally see at a Tom's. There's also a definite Greek vibe to the place, from the baklava at the hostess desk, to the avolemono soup (one of the best I've had in Pittsburgh) and gyros. The portions are big, the food has that awesome diner style, the coffee is just right, and I haven't had anything I haven't liked yet. Also, make sure you try their rice pudding- mmm.
By the way- any restaurant that uses two grilled cheese sandwiches for a burger bun is always a winner in my book."}
{"text":"I think we found our new go-to brunch place. My boo and I came here because it near by and we love diners. Though it doesn't look like a diner from the outside, we felt the local love as soon as we entered. The menu had all the best breakfast foods and portions were pretty big but that was expected. Our waitress was a doll and made us feel like we were old friends. Love it, we'll totally be back."}
{"text":"Great Food!  Don't get put off at all by the diner name, this place is a true restaurant.  For some thats good but I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't a greasy spoon.  The menu is a decent size, not too much to choose from that it drives you crazy and enough to cover a broad selection of tastes.  

The service was decent, but the food made up for it.  The fried cheese wheel was great!  The cakes and pies for dessert were massive and delicious."}
{"text":"i went there bc i saw on their online menu they have just about anything made of gyro meat. well after an hour and twenty min drive, im settled behind a 3 egg omlette with gyro meat, peepers and onions. eeewwwweeee!. i coulda put it on  a peta it was so good. very crowded on a sat. morning with no wait at the door though. everyone loved their food also wich was the strawberry stuffed french toast, choc chip pancakes and reg pancakes.

extremely clean and thery serve real gyros. what else can be said"}
{"text":"I love Penny's!  The food is always great and the portions are fantastic.  It's a nice atmosphere, never really too loud.  The only downside is I think they're under-staffed, the waitresses seem to be distracted a lot.  The quality of the food makes up for it, though."}
{"text":"My parents moved out this way 18 months ago and we were looking for something local and cool, so we headed to Penny's Diner. First thing I noticed was that they were packed, which is a good thing. But then the waitress, Krystle) in the back (near where people wait) was yelling the F-word at her colleagues in the back. Way too close for the people waiting for tables to hear it. This was off putting but figured we'd try it.

We were seated in ten minutes. We both ordered the soup (me the french onion and Mum got the red pepper), and I was a little hesitant because the foul mouth waitress was ours (I did get her name from the receipt). We had about an hour until an appointment so I was cognizant of the time. I watched people get seated around me. My Mum got her soup in about 4 minutes but mine never came. 30 minutes later as I watched people around me, seated after me, get their food, I waited for JUST my soup. No soup. Finally 5 minutes before our food arrived and long after my mum's soup came, I got my Onion Soup, which was fantastic! Really good.  Two minutes later our food came. My burger was suppose to be well done. I bit into it and almost puked. It was red (not even pink). I sent it back immediately.

I thought maybe the burger took 40 minutes to get because it was well done and even made a joke about killing the cow out back because it was so long. When I sent it back, I had a new, well done burger in literally 3 minutes! WTF. Why couldn't it be that fast the last time?

The burger was AWESOME. The soup was good. My mum loved her Omelet but the SERVICE SUCKED. Maybe Krystle was having a bad day but she would drop off my food, or drink or whatever and run before I could even open my mouth, I was pissed off. Seriously. This was the service. The food rocked but service sucked. I asked the server (who I had to pay and she hovered as I wrote the tip to make sure I didn't under tip her which I really wanted to do!) if it was always this busy and she said it is. 

If you want good food, maybe come when they open. Try to get a different waitress and never go on a Sunday (I went at 1pm on a Tuesday)."}
