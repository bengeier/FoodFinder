{"text":"I have never had the food...but for a late night place of drinks, this place it great.  Good music, nice ambiance and a sophisticated clientele....it is worth stopping by to check out."}
{"text":"Great service, wine and atmosphere. My only disappointment was that they didn't serve cheese. They do offer a charcuterie board but no cheese options. Otherwise this was a great place."}
{"text":"Dim lit, tavernesque bar in the old port which caters mainly to an older crowd. Nevertheless, my boyfriend and I weren't taken seriously by none of the employees there including the manager who commented on our presence to their barman.  This put a sour taste in my mouth. After one drink, I decided we should go have supper elsewhere.  Despite our age, we are customers who want to have a good drinking and dining experience, no?"}
{"text":"Great food with amazing ambiance. DJ was on fire and we had a blast. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"We wandered in and went to the back of the restaurant. Sat at the bar and was served by 2 awesome ladies.  Helped us with our drink order + a late dinner order. What can I say , but a solid 10. I'll come back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Atmosphere is great. Crowd is ages 30-60 and the dj is off the hook. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Got here as I was walking by on my trip vacation trip to MTL looking for a couple of late drinks and a byte. Well I was not disappointed. First, I was greeted by friendly staff and they were all well dressed. I felt invited and welcomed. Next drinks; I got two of the recommended cocktails. The best was one refreshing cocktail that was made with cucumber. Third food; decided to have the smoked meat tacos. They were delicious and a light fare for the late evening. The atmosphere was a place with a hip decor, lighting and music. Too bad there is not a dance floor. I will certainly come back on my next vacation to MTL."}
{"text":"Good tapas, akward service. A little pricey but good. Meal ended on an uncomfortable note with the waiter insisting we tell him how much tip we wanted to leave, paying with a credit card through POS terminal. Seriously dude WTF?? Music is also a little loud."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and a drink. The food and service were good but nothing I would go out of my way to run back to."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the ambiance is great for girls night out- there was great music and the place got crowded pretty quick. Get a reservation, the waiters are amazing too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled upon this bar in the old port while we were walking around waiting for our dinner reservation. The drinks were delicious and the place was modern and eclectic. The place was completely booked past 7 so I think they're doing well."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, this is my go to bar in Old Montreal! Great food, Great service, highly recommended to both locals and tourists..."}
{"text":"So much fun at night. Went on a Saturday for cocktails. High energy. Good/Fun music. Great craft cocktails"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. Had a coupon and came by. Nice drinks and appetizers, pretty space"}
{"text":"I loooove this place! Athmosphere is the best! The crew is welcoming and the food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time! The staff here is so attentive, and even made us country bumpkins feel welcome and at home. We had some cocktails, each was outstanding. Our server was amazing. She really made the place for us!"}
{"text":"Food. Great. Atmosphere. Great. DJ...... FUCKING INCREDIBLE. Best dinner DJ ever, I danced all the calories away, SITTING."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! We ordered the Lamb Shank, the salmon and the duck. The lamb was so tender, the salmon was so tasty and the duck was delightful. Our waiter was very professional and took great pride in offering us great service. The wine (Chardonnay) and the craft beer were excellent too! All in all, great experience. Highly recommend it!  The ambiance is posh, and very chic."}
{"text":"Loved the oysters that came with additional saucing of your choice,  Great selection of wines, and hand crafted cocktails.  Great Moscow mule but I wish it would have been served in the traditional copper mug,"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great! Great service/food/drinks/decor/ambiance. The person at the front greeted us enthusiastically and every single person who worked there was also incredibly friendly and attentive. Without a reservation, we were looking to find a place for dinner. We walked in and did not have to wait at all. They opened up the smaller bar near the front for us and essentially gave us a private bar. The food was excellent (I had steak, friends had mac and cheese and beef tar tar) and especially with the Canadian-US exchange rate, the prices were very reasonable. Both bartenders we had were amazing, friendly, and attentive and even gave us recommendations for restaurants to explore while we visit Montreal. We ended up staying late into the night as the atmosphere became more like a nightclub. Even their DJ was awesome, playing 80-90s pop early in the night and more thumping 90-00s pop/r&b later into the night. I will definitely plan to return here next time I'm in Montreal and recommend it for anyone looking for good drinks, food, and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We ordered our food and it took an hour for it to come out. In fairness it was pretty good food but terrible service makes the experience of eating good food entirely unenjoyable. In that hour while we were waiting for our food not a single server checked in with us to let us know what the status was, ask us if we wanted to order more drinks or even refill our water. Meanwhile all the tables around us were getting attention. Maybe it's an anti-tourist thing, but if that's the case, Montreal tourists be advised."}
{"text":"Très bon petit resto/bar qui se transforme en genre de club plus tard.. Nous y avons été pour Montréal à table et le menu est vraiment excellent. Pour 31$, vous avez entrée, plat et dessert, tous délicieux! La salade de betteraves est exquise, la soupe aux lentilles aussi, la souris d'agneau très goûteuse et très bien accompagnée (purée maison et légumes racines), et la panna cota en dessert est divine! A l'intérieur, c'est assez intime, sombre. Le service est très bon, pas besoin de demander de l'eau en cours de repas ou les choses de base (menu, ustensiles,..). Bref, à essayer!"}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and tasty drinks. Bar tender was helpful and on point, all staff seemed to be friendly"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, atmosphere and food. We came early, about 5:30 pm and were promptly seated/served with no reservation. It was quiet at that time.   Food was fantastic. We had seared trout, salmon tartare, shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great ambiance. DJ on Wednesday nights is awesome and plays good music. Drinks are delicious, and cheese plate was yummy. Pickled beets!   The owner is very nice and showed me around the space. They have a beautiful private dining room!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good ambiance to go for a happy hour On the food menu try the Poulet Noircie and the Beets Salad, you won't be deceived"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Went there to watch the Clinton Trump showdown, it was a great atmosphere everyone was very friendly buying shots and debating politics. The food was a ok and a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!  Lovely little quaint restaurant/bar/lounge.  I enjoyed all the plates the friendly staff recommended.  My fave was the Octopus! Great ambience and urban chic decor :-)"}
{"text":"Mimi La Nuit is a cool intimate spot with great music and a nice menu! However today's review is based on my last visit which was my third visit there. I went there with my girlfriend and her sister for an evening of dinner and drinks, however didn't end up staying.   It was a Wednesday evening around 8:30pm and the music level was so loud we couldn't hear each other speak! Even if I wasn't with ppl I do not think I would be able to sit down and enjoy my dinner with the music at that level. Normally I would definitely recommend this place for a date, because of the small intimate atmosphere, the great variety of music and the lights are nice and low.  However my review today is with great hopes that they see this and correct it."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience with the bartender, Emilie. Highly attentive, warm, kept the drinks flowing, and managed to keep engaging conversation despite being quite busy with other patrons. Her wine suggestions were spot on, the shots were delicious, and even the mini burgers were surprisingly tasty. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Situated in Old Montreal, Mimi is a \"small\" restaurant that at first glance has everything to please. But as you sit down, look around and checkout the menu, the feeling starts to change and doutes arise.  The food : it looks and sounds great, but in the end, the plates are super small for the price and you're continuously left with an appetite for more. But considering the cost, I wasn't very content with my order. I went with a porc plate that looked great on the menu, but when I saw it in real life, I couldn't believe how small the portion was. Nothing really bad, but more so, nothing to write home about. Other friends went other plates, and most of us had the same feeling - we expected more...  The space : now this is not a big place, so if you're looking into a group thing, many other restaurants can do better. Again, i'm sure they'll find a way to fit you and your group, but i think its a much better restaurant for a small group or couple (let's say 1 to 4 people).  The atmosphere : now I'll be hard here - turn down that music! At some point I thought we were in a discotheque with a bunch of remix found on Spotify. I'm more than happy to have music in the background, but they just try to hard to make it hip and cool - bottom line it just doesn't work. Everyone in our group had the same comment, and other customers also.  The service : long long long. It took more than 10 minutes to get simple drinks. As we were a group of around 10 people, plates were served in no particular order and all of us got what we ordered at a different time. Now we expected some delays because of the group, but most plates at a different time just doesn't do it for me.  All and all : I admit I'm forcing myself to put up 3 stars in the review and that's because they really seemed to try and make it good and nice... The ambiance is beautiful, very clean and hip but it's just missing that little something - a certain je ne sais quoi...   Recommandation : put the music down, tell people the plates a wickedly small, have less fusion cooking in the kitchen, adjust the prices for at least half the plates and I think the place will get somewhere. The Montreal scene is very competitive, and many other restaurants in or around do a much better job."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the service was mediocre. Despite the restaurant being empty, we were seated directly across from the only other party in the restaurant.  The style of tables are that in which the tables are \"u\" shaped and open up to each other. Needless to say, it was a little cozy with the other party and it was difficult to have our own conversations without feeling awkward. We asked the server if we could move to the open table by the window, but was told (rather rudely) that they were reserved (nobody else came during the time we were there). It was also a little strange that the place was virtually empty at 7 o'clock on a Saturday evening in old port.   Nonetheless we ordered a few items to share and we were pleasantly surprised by the food. The meat tacos were my favorite, but my dad claims the duck confit salad was the best duck he's ever had. I could've done without the fried cauliflower and even though the avocado crostini was messy to eat, it was very tasty.   Overall, a unique and modern atmosphere with great food! (Just don't expect to have much personal space )"}
{"text":"Charming place located in the heart of Old Montreal. It was upscale enough that there was no riff-raff, small enough that the groups congregating around the bar had a more intimate environment to hang out in. The music was good and not too loud, the drinks were well crafted (the gin-gin mule was amazing), the bartenders were good looking and fun to hang with, and the crowd was great.  Our bartender poured us a parting shot on the way out, which is always a plus!  We had a great time here. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night out that doesn't want to go to a \"frat bar.\""}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Great music, live DJ. The food is delicious and different, but not overpriced. Good sized portions. Ambiance is fun, open and wild. Welcome to Mimi la nuit :)"}
{"text":"Great spot in old town. Hip place for dinner and drinks! They play awesome music and the crowd is solid. Very friendly staff to say the least. The space is tight and the music is loud...so old cranky up-tight people should go some place else. Lots of good looking girls...Cougars and younger ladies. The customers and staff are well dressed. There is a back bar as well as two bars up front. I'd suggest making a reservation if you are planning on dinning. Again, this place is super hip and the staff are awesome! They have a wonderful wine menu too!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Have specials.  Nice ambience.  Good music. I really like stake tartar.  Chicken is very good as well.  Octopus is ok... Dont like yhe way they served it... Loosing all taste... In my opinion."}
{"text":"Love it every time. Great food, fabulous drinks, amazing music especially if you like retro, lots of theme nights. Great for group parties. Not a place for romance, but for fun."}
{"text":"Terrific place for a girls night out!  Unassuming from the outside, but inside, the drinks are great, atmosphere is cozy, and our bartender was awesome!  I came with a group of 8 girls for a bachlorette, and we wished there was a dance floor for us - the music was soooo good!  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"A great night life scene on rue St. Paul in the port area of Montreal. The bartenders are fantastic!  The music was great too! My girlfriend and I loved this place and would recommend it to anyone headed to Montreal."}
{"text":"Worst value for money I've seen in the city. Good place if you are into overpriced canned food. Tables are tiny, they try to pack as many tables as they can.  You can easily overhear other people's conversation.   The environment makes you lose all the appetite and want to leave as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on a very poor experience with the bartender with slicked back blond hair and a very bad attitude.  Keep in mind we were his only clients for a 6pm drink.  He was unable to offer two of their signature drinks because they were out of ingredients/mezcal.  The bartender was then trying to conceal his texting by holding his phone in the sink.  Then, he assumed we were tipping $7 on a $33 bill (of just drinks) and we had to ask for change.  To top it all off, he started yelling at us for undertipping.  Not like we're going to cave in and give him more money after he schooled us in Montreal etiquette."}
{"text":"Nice modern bar in Old Montreal. It's a good bar for young people that likes to have a good time with friends. Good for groups. Food is good for a bar. We tried the oysters, crevettte, short ribs, pork belly sandwich, Brussel sprouts, veal salad, and their two desserts (dark chocolate bar and cheesecake). Thumbs up for the food!! Service was okay. The wait staff are nice!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this during our afternoon walk trough old Montreal. We sat on their front patio and had champagne, but the menu looked great and we really liked the atmosphere and our server was great. The inside is larger than it seems and looks like a nice place for late night, too."}
{"text":"I generally trust yelp ratings but Mimi la Nuit was severely overrated. I never thought I would give a 1 star but Mimi earned it. First of all we walked in at 435 PM and were made to feel like a nuisance by the arrogant, rude bartender (slick back blonde haired guy). I reminded him that they opened at 4pm...to be honest given the first impression we should have left but we didn't.   On to the wine list....we saw it listed as a wine bar which was an overstatement. They only had 2 red wines we could order by the glass. The had a few more white wines so my wife and I ordered the sauv blanc. Surprise surprise, they only had enough left for 1/2 a glass.   Avoid this place like the plague. They are far from a quality wine bar and the service was probably the worst I have ever experienced. The bartender was unfit to deal with customers. He was by far the worst bartender I have ever come across. What a joke!"}
{"text":"New Old Montreal favorite!! Love the ambience of Mimi la Nuit. Music at a level where you can have a conversation without yelling. Classy premium brand drinks. Innovative food menu for a range of budgets.  The menu is creative and always changing.  Portioned to support your drinks, rather than the other way around.  The size of the space depends on the day you go.  The space expands towards the waterfront & the upstairs too."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a drink in the old port. It is well done environment that is good to hang with friends. But you must make sure to get a good area for your group because when it is packed it is hard to get around and standing in the corridor can become annoying."}
{"text":"Traumatized. I thought this place was supposed to be an upscale, intimate experience. We walked in on what seemed like a middle aged nightclub? Washrooms were confusing, they're unisex but there's nothing stopping you from walking in on random men peeing. Really wanted to like this place but my god was it cluttered."}
{"text":"Went to Mimi La Nuit on our first night in town and wasn't overly impressed. The front door is hard to find, the place was crowded and the tables are tiny. Barely enough space to actually put food on. The food was mediocre. The salad was good, but the entrees were not great. The service was friendly but a bit slow. It was fine, but I would go somewhere else if I returned to Montreal."}
{"text":"My partner and I were wondering around Old Montreal during a recent visit and happenstance upon Mimi La Nuit. It was very nondescript in a speakeasy sort of way, so we went it. Though all the bars around here were very busy, this was empty - literally - because it was going through a soft opening in early January and is probably fully open by now.  Because this was more of a predinner snack, we didn't get too much food or drink here. We opted for the shrimp on a stick, which came with an inventive presentation if not amazing taste.  The drink menu needed some work, and my partner made his own cocktail because nothing on the menu appealed to him.    I really liked the vibe in here, and would definitely come back when it was fully open and popping."}
{"text":"This darkly-lit bar is just across the street from The Keg, so we came here after dinner for a nightcap.  I don't know if it's because we went on a Wednesday night, but it was mostly empty. That's not a problem, but you'd think if a bar isn't busy the service would be good. We were actually sitting at the bar and it still took the bartender over 5 minutes to come by and take our drink orders. Why the delay? Maybe he was tired, who knows. Thankfully the drinks were good - it seems like they really know what they're doing.   Overall, 4 stars for the drinks, 2 for the service so I averaged it out and gave them 3."}
{"text":"We wandered in on a Thursday afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed a few hours sitting by the window, people watching and noshing on naan + dips, olives, and Greek meatballs. The service was perfect, highly recommend for a place to feel chic and cool off (or warm up as the case may be!)."}
{"text":"endroit très sympa pour un 5@7 le seul bémol pas beaucoup de légumes mis a part les pomme de terre et choux de bruxelles .le service est très moyen on a pas était tous servis en meme temps"}
{"text":"We were there with a group of 10, app : tempura shrimp(12$l, ceasar salad(15$). Main : NY strip(45$). #1 overpriced, but its old port so lets be real... #2 bit a piece of stick in the batter of my shrimp and on 7 shrimp there was a half one (plate comped) #3 Ny strip after cutting through half of the piece on meat with my knife, had to ask if they had better knives... they had, just didnt bring it with the 45$ steak... #4 everything was oversalted and the flavours were simple. #5 after what you read go at your own risks... there are better places for this price in the old port."}
{"text":"Cool and trendy, definitely a great choice for 5-7 drinks with colleagues or maybe a girl's night out. The cocktails are to die for!"}
{"text":"The music was loud and obnoxious and the food was worse. The most bland, uninspired and expensive dish I've had in recent memory."}
{"text":"I really liked mimi la nuit. The music is very good, the food also good, no big plates, more like tapas style and a little pricey. They even have a charlie chaplin movie projected on the wall which is nice. Overall the ambiance is great, I recommend it"}
{"text":"I came here for a work function and they accommodated by providing a four course menu. I specified to the waiter that I had an Onion allergy and they were very good at providing me the dishes containing no onions. I found everything had a little too much salt, especially the Portobello mushrooms that came with my fish. Service was good and the drinks were nice as well. I would come back"}
{"text":"This is the best food we tried in Montreal, you can go on the street and not perceive this place as we did until we yelped it! Great option! Our waitress Camelia gave us all the details and explained the options. It was a great experience! Recommended"}
{"text":"I went there a while ago ... after a night out in the old port ... And being with a group of friends they opted going to Mimi la nuit The place was packed ... and even though i did not hate my evening i don't think i'll ever go back The place was loud ... we went all the way to the back of the club ... but the smell of grease ( from the kitchen ) we returned to the front ( which was way louder ) The crow seemed to like the place ... me? Not my type of club ..."}
{"text":"So, while I think Mimi la Nuit is definitely for some folks, it definitely was not for us. The crowd appears to be the middle-aged cruising-types and we (mid-twenties, edgy-looking) stuck out like sore thumbs, although we're very accustomed to Montreal wine bars. But that's not necessarily the establishment's fault.  I found most things about this place to be unfoundedly pretentious here: the decor, the food (ex. tepid & chalky $8 fries), prices, and the service. The service was stand-offish and we definitely felt snobbed. At one point our server laughed at me because I didn't understand where we were supposed to be seated. We visited Mimi while the resto was relatively quiet, although as soon as some high-rollers entered the bar our server abandoned us- leaving the hostess to settle our bill.  I think the wine was ok but I was a bit too profoundly put-off by the environment and experience."}
