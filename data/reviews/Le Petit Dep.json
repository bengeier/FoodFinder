{"text":"Great place for sweets and coffee! Beautiful cafe and street. Would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"The cookie we had was perfect (soft, tasted fresh) and worth going back for. Maybe I've been purchasing too many medium-sized drinks lately to remember -- but the small coffee here was almost laughably small. Very hipster-y dep with random odds and ends inside (and ranging from slightly overpriced to the right price point). Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Cutest little place. Was drawn to it because of the pretty store front. Got the mango and vanilla twist ice cream and it was delicios! Service with a smile, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-go (or at least a must-see).  My sister and I split a slice of chocolate cake and some maple ice cream and sat and chatted into the evening.  Good for souvenirs, drinks/snacks, and pretty photos!"}
{"text":"A slightly on-the-nose French inspired convenient store with a couple of interesting products you won't find anywhere else in town. Everything is obviously overpriced but reasonably so"}
{"text":"Stopped at this little place on a freezing winter day looking for something warm. They serve pre-made sandwiches and smoothies. We had a shrimp sandwich, an egg salad sandwich, a grilled cheese sandwich and a blueberry banana smoothie. Everything was appetizing and yumm-o."}
{"text":"What a cute little shop! Perfect place to grab some nice beers and snacks for our hotel. I misunderstood the candy bar, but the woman at the coffee counter kindly helped me combine my kids' selections into one container to save $ - but keeping their choices separate. A small thing but just so thoughtful."}
{"text":"Popped in here a few times while in town visiting.  I kept hoping I would find a nice souvenir for my parents but everything is just insanely expensive.  I'm sure it's because it's in Old Montreal but I probably would have spent a significant amount of money here if everything was slightly less expensive.  They have gummy bears from a manufacturer in Indiana I'm familiar with being from Chicago and I've never seen them marked up that high.  Cute ambiance though!"}
{"text":"No matter how many times I enter this shop I always spend hours checking out the new finds- from local artisanal baked goods and coffee with their little European 2 seater area to the Montreal Souvenirs or the 70s inspired candy spread - fill your container with as much candy as you can for 4.50$? Literally you will feel like a kid in a candy shop no joke! Groceries or emergency pick ups? No problem -this is your high end Ogilvy tabagie! this will always be my pit stop in Old Port!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled into this little store while waiting for a table in a restaurant nearby. This store is quintessential Old Montreal! It's a hodge podge of gifts, snacks,amenities and grocery items. But it's all beautifully laid out in a small space. The prices are reasonable and I really liked the friendly staff. They offer tea/coffee, cafe style counter service as well! Wines, cheeses, small bites, sweets...name it! It's all in this little shop. I will be back here again the next visit. It's a fun browse but I'm betting you find something you just can't live without in here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were walking around town looking for something sweet and caffeinated to finish our wonderful day in Vieux-Montreal. When we stumbled across Le Petit Dep, we knew we had found it! Yelp has it listed as a convienience store, but it's so much more. Sure, you can find delicious salads, a healthy snack, hand creams  but we came for dessert and we weren't disappointed. Wonderful baked goods, (some were even vegan or gluten-free) and any type of coffee you could want! All of this served in a small, magical surrounding similar to that of an antiques store. Go here with someone special!You'll love it."}
{"text":"Super quaint - filled with candies of yesterday and today. Also a full service coffee bar. Their iced coffee (cold brew) was really good.  There are no tables outside, but there are a few inside and a couple chairs to sit at the window."}
{"text":"Petit dépanneur/café super charmant dans un recoin du vieux Montréal. Il est chargé de pleins de produits (bonbons, chocolats, chandails montréalais...) avec un menu très varié et délicieux. Mon chai latté glacé était parfait avec assez de cannelle (comme je l'aime) le que le staff poli!  Je compte y retourner prochainement si je suis dans le coin sans hésiter."}
{"text":"A tad obsessed with this quaint place. It's like a corner store turned vintage and French that is half bakery/coffee shop and half grocery shop. We stayed at the nearby Saint Sulpice Hotel during our weekend stay in Montreal and Le Petit was the perfect place to get breakfast items back to the hotel, as well as getting coffee to go.  Besides coffee, baked goods, and some light groceries, there are gourmet items like chocolates and nuts. For the love of poutine, I bought a t-shirt from here that said \"Poutine\" at the front :) A little more expensive than a t-shirt I could have gotten from the various tacky souvenir shops down the street but the better quality of my new t-shirt more than justified it."}
{"text":"They have such an amazing yet simple Sheperd's Pie. The store is also very cute with little gifts & snacks. We enjoyed the vibe, food, & service! I love mango smoothies & ordered the Mangolessi. It had virtually no flavor nor consistency which was disappointing. Stick to the pie & random buys."}
{"text":"Always come here for great coffee and snacks!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident. But it's adorable. Part cafe, part candy store, they sell old school candy (think Juicyfruit and Razzles) but also make a mean chai latte. The small round marble top tables are quaint and the baristas are pleasant. A one of a kind cafe that mixes equal parts quaint, funky, hip and delicious. Go get some."}
{"text":"I have mixed views when it comes to rating this place between a 4 & 5 star.   It's a cute little corner shop that also services food, baked goods and ice cream! The store is quite small and full of things. It was quite hard to walk around because of the amount of things and people inside. They have a couple of tables and chairs inside the store so you can enjoy the food. They have a bench just outside where you can sit with your ice cream.   They have many options for the milkshake/ice cream. Both my friend and I decided to indulge in the classic 2 flavoured swirl. It was vanilla and blueberry. The blueberry was quite sour. However, it was so so good! We were disappointed that there wasn't a proper place to sit in and out the shop. We could have walked all the way to the port to enjoy the ice cream, but we needed to visit a place on the same street. So we waited as until a family finished their ice cream, and then enjoyed our delicious dessert on the bench which was surrounded by plants.   The staff was great. They laughed and joked with us, explained the menu options and helped us decide our ice cream.   If you're in the old port then I definitely recommend this place. Just know there's a high probability you won't find place to sit there."}
{"text":"I saw a small tour group getting mini soft serve twist cones and decided to try one myself. House-made vanilla and mango soft serve was amazing and I also got a couple gifts to bring back for friends: organic maple syrup and maple coffee butter. Very cute shop that doesn't feel tourist-y. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just a perfect Montreal Cafe. Excellent coffee and pastries - friendly, interesting staff and solid music. A perfect moment in a great city. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Randomly walking around with my friend, we stumbled upon this cute \"corner store\" style place. We grabbed a bottle of water and ordered the Shepard Pie. It is really good. It has a creamy corn substance in the center.  Afterwards, we grabbed a mini vanilla ice cream cone that look like it'll take one bit to demolish.  If definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Such a great little spot. We stopped by in the morning for waters and snacks and went back later and got sandwiches and wine to take back to our Airbnb for dinner! The grilled cheese, egg salad, and smoked meat sandwich were soooo good! Great spot!"}
{"text":"A cute little shop with a few grocery items, drinks, freshly brewed coffee and pastries. This shop was across the street from our hotel and was always just what we needed. Get the pistachio pastry -- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Adorable petite boutique de style dépanneur se situant dans le Vieux Montréal. Lorsqu'on y rentre l'endroit fait penser à une confiserie avec toutes les jares de bonbons ici et là. L'endroit est coloré, amusant et le service est super friendly. On m'a suggéré comme boisson le chai latte et pour mon amie la limonade rose. Les deux options se sont avérées être de très bons choix. Le chai latte, je suis super difficile, et celui ci était parfaitement dosé, bien épicé (je l'aurais juste pris un peu plus chaud, mais avec la canicule ce n'est pas plus mal). Ils proposent de la crème glacé et des petits snacks. Pas beaucoup de places pour s'asseoir donc prendre pour emporter"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has no review !! I decided to take a risk and go try it, and wow ! So happy to do it !! Amazing and super tasty iced coffee and espresso !!! The \"Chocolatine aux pistaches\" was extraordinary tasty and delicious (à tomber par terre)... What a great discover and I will definetly miss that taste of coffee when I'm back to Boston... Bravo les gars !!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to grab a snack or coffee to fuel up and walk around the Old Port area with.  Kind of like a boutique bodega with some nicer food, drink, and snack items to choose from.  Iced coffee Americano I ordered was tasty. Espresso shots topped with water then served over ice. Nice caffeine rush to explore the area with.  Prices seemed fair. Service was friendly with a smile. Not bad."}
{"text":"This was a really cute, rustic deppaneur/Cantonese type of shop. Situated in old Montreal is Le petit dep - this area is really one of my favourites in the city as you never know what you'll find - luckily I stumbled upon this great shop.   The store has an old-timely vibe. There's a cafe at the front with some baked goods, some cold-cuts and drinks in the fridges, some Knick-knacks here and there, and some seating.   I came here multiple times and tried different things...ordered a croissant and cookie as well as the soft-serve of the week.   The croissant was buttery and flaky, and the cookie was soft and delicious. The ice cream though I have to say is incredible. They change the flavour every few weeks so when I went it was a strawberry sorbet soft serve. I opted for the twist...oh man was it good! Creamy but not too filling. Satisfying yet oh so refreshing! I need more!   Definitely check this place out for a quick snack in old Montreal."}
{"text":"This shop is so cute! We ran in to get out of the snow and poked around. I got a funny cartoon poutine postcard and some carrot cake. Looked like lots of fun food gifts and drinks too"}
{"text":"The cutest depanneur with the best soft serve ice cream. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Disappointing breakfast trip. The woman at the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful, made us repeat our six item order three times and still forgot  the orange juice. They have frittata listed on the breakfast menu, but instead of something warm and fresh, it was a disgusting, cold, pre-packaged cylinder of egg. The pastries and smoothies were average - we particularly enjoyed the scone. The only thing of note was the beautiful latte."}
{"text":"The store is run by a bunch of yuppie millennials who are absolutely clueless to the word service.  Pretentious beyond belief. I'm sure the owner would be mortified knowing the lack of hospitality provided."}
{"text":"In Old Port, we do find everything! Even this little dépanneur! It has products made in Quebec, it has snacks, ice cream, coffee, drinks, souvenirs, a lot of stuff! They're not like your common dépanneur, they're cozier and more welcoming. A lot of people go in, so it may get cramped in there but who caaaaares. I bought ice cream here and it was delicious and refreshing!   You should definitely pass by even if you don't want to buy anything! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This little store is easy to miss but it is worth seeking out. They have a nice selection of home-made pastries, baked goods and sandwiches. Oh, and they make the best cappuccino in town, which was a very pleasant surprise. They also have a nice selection of treats, including chocolate, candy, nice beers, and Quebec specialties."}
{"text":"Tres cute et coloré café - depanneur avec petite restauration et articles variés, juste 3 petites tables chaleureuses à l'interieur pour deguster ton repas."}
{"text":"This little dépanneur is freaking adorable. It's like it fell out of storybookland and onto the streets of Old Montreal. It has cute gifts for people, artsy photo-postcards, artisanal chocolates, fresh made pastries, little salads and sandwiches to go, local beers, and coffee (they use beans from 49th Parallel Coffee Roasters in Vancouver). They also conveniently have an ATM and they usually sell stamps (although they were out when I went)."}
{"text":"This is a cute, convenient cafe. The people working here are super nice. We were staying close by for a few days so we stopped in here everyday we were there. so the items I really enjoyed were the iced coffee, cronut and even a twist ice cream inside a donut."}
