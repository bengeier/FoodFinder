{"text":"Awesome addition to the neighborhood, we needed a  great coffee place. Friendly staff, great atmosphere and a nice selection of tea as well. A good spot to read, study or catch up. Only downside is that their pastry/food items are very limited."}
{"text":"Located right in-between two Starbucks, Shaughnessy Cafe offers a great alternative for my morning cup of coffee. The service was great, the space is open, and the coffee was also good. $2.75 for a large coffee (though their larges are mediums by large coffee retailer standards). If you're living in the Shaughnessy area like I am, consider making this cafe your go to spot and avoid the long lines, over crowdedness, and homogeny of Starbucks."}
{"text":"Lovely. Friendly, clean & stylish, delicious coffee, free wifi. We happened upon this place upon arriving in Montreal and it is such a nice find. If this place was in my city I would be glad to be able to be a regular."}
{"text":"I had perfect dose of americano

The staff there was very welcoming also they are selling great stuffs for barista (kettle/cups)
Also nice place to read or study  definitely recommended"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this coffee shop for a while now and finally got to it to do some studying. The music and overall ambiance are great to help you focus, the baristas are very friendly and helpful and their americano was amazing! I also got a butter croissant (freshly out of the oven, I couldn't resist the smell). Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to study on a rainy day. Great wifi and service! The barista was super friendly and the music in the cafe was soothing. Glad they opened up in the neighbourhood! WIll be back to get some caffeine and do some work. 

Big windows for light and super cute interior decor. They have a loyalty card program as well."}
{"text":"Their cold brew isn't the most affordable but staff is generally pretty nice. Cool spot to work if you're looking to avoid the typical Starbucks crowd"}
{"text":"Bright space. Friendly staff. Good latté."}
{"text":"I love the selection of baked goods that are available at Shaughnessy cafe. The interior is very clean inside, and there are a lot of plants by the windows (good place to take instagram photos). The cafe is quiet and a good place to study. Their filter coffee is quite delicious as well. I tried their date bar and raspberry scone. Their date bar is a must-try, but their scone kind of disappointed me. The scone was cooked perfectly, but there was not enough flavour or raspberries inside the scone itself."}
{"text":"Entre deux courses, je me suis arrêtée pour goûter leur café et une chocolatine. Winner! J'ai adoré et le service était très sympa!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee!! One of those places where the latte is better than cappuccino. Their beans have lot of strong and bitter flavours which blend well with the high milk percentage of a latte. The milk is steamed smoothly and the taste is velvety to its best. You'll like this place if you like the coffee at Pikolo. It's near Concordia area so lots of students are a regular here. It's a great study spot, very quiet . The spots near the window are bright with natural light but the tables more on the inside can get a bit dark. They have outdoor seating for the summer. Clean bathroom. Gets very busy during noon."}
{"text":"Solid third wave coffee. Excellent americano. One of the best in montreal. In the conversation with Monopole, Finca and Differance."}
{"text":"Mignon café minimaliste et simple, avec de grandes fenêtres donnant sur la rue. C'est épuré, mais quand même très sympathique. Le café est de grande qualité (j'ai remarqué du café de Dispatch Coffee), et très bien fait. Parfait pour les étudiants du Collège LaSalle ou Dawson, dans les environs. C'est l'endroit parfait pour étudier, et ça paraît!"}
{"text":"Unremarkable coffee in a clean new cafe that seems to be a squat or study hall for students instead of a cafe. 

The night I went there they were having some kind of gathering on veganism and I was rudely served without a smile and eyed unpleasantly by the vegans there trying to see a projection on the wall. It was like the coffee business was interfering in some cult meeting. 

The coffee was OK but there was grounds in my latte.  Perhaps they were more interested in the discussion on tempeh instead of pouring a good shot of espresso. 

It's nice to see small business in the neighbourhood but it's nothing to differentiate from the countless other coffee shops in walking distance."}
{"text":"Really nice spot that opened up recently downtown. The decor is minimal and simple, no complaints here except maybe switch the tungsten bulbs for daylight (a battle I will seemingly never win in Montréal). Great espresso-based drinks with a nice ambience, perfect for working or a casual meeting downtown. Their baristas have always been super friendly without the attitude, which is a nice plus. They also carry Fernwood coffee which, as far as I know, is only available here in Montreal.

Overall, a really nice alternative to Myriade or Melk just a little bit further West."}
{"text":"Located in the spot of the recently close down greasy spoon late night eats restaurant is now a newly renovated morning pick me up Cafe.  

Passed by on my walk to work for a quick double espresso in house. (3$ - which is fairly priced and to go options available) and loved it!

Choices of coffee (at the moment Fernwood Canadian roaster from BC) , tea and viennoiserie."}
{"text":"Great new coffee stop in an area that badly needed something cool. A place to get a good coffee and have a meeting or get some work done. The place is completely redone and thank God it needed it. No insult to the old Moe's ( I, like many enjoyed a late night or early morning there) but it was time. Happy to have good option in the area. Thx guys"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this spot just opened up in my neighborhood! As someone who lives in the area and works from home, I know we desperately needed a cute, cool, go-to cafe downtown. 

The staff working on a Sunday morning were very nice and perfectly bilingual. Lattes were great and reasonably priced. 

Decor is minimal and inviting and I can't wait to sit on their terrasse come summer."}
{"text":"It's a famous coffee shop located next to Atwater station and it's really popular for students because of the location and the affordable coffee. There's also a small terrace outside the coffee shop and people chill there on a sunny day. I really like the service at the cafe since the barista was friendly and prepared really good (and really strong) allongé for me. The most iconic piece of decor in this minimalistic coffee shop is the mosaic tabletop, it's really exotic and adored by Instagrammers. There are also a bunch of travel pictures and a shelf full of Lonely Planet travel books, I guess the owner really likes traveling and wants to share this passion with the clients. In sum, come enjoy your time in this lovely cafe, you will not regret your choice!"}
{"text":"A cute half-underground cafe. The Latte tasted good! The staffs here are so nice! I also like the decorations inside. I think it's a good place to chat with friends. The background music is kind of loud, so maybe it's a little bit nosy for studying."}
{"text":"Welcoming place, smell so good, nice service, windows all around, coffee, chai , tea and more available. Few tables but not to crowd."}
