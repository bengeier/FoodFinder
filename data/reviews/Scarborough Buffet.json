{"text":"I love buffets. This was pretty low on quality. Food was over cooked, or under cooked, the selection wasn't very good, and the condition inside wasn't all that great. I would not have paid that much for my meal at all. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Had lunch there in the weekend, both me and my wife got stomach sickness afterwards, will never go again. Super buffet was way better, cleaner and better choices."}
{"text":"I went here earlier this week and was not impressed. Food selection was lacking and the quality of the dishes were off the mark as well. Everything was quite greasy. The typical deep fried fare was what seemed to be the most abundant. Staff also need to restock bowls and cutlery more often. 

Also found it strange that all of their plates said \"Super Buffet\" from the previous ownership and does not reflect their own branding."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I have ever eaten at. The restaurant looks big and it was quite busy but for a restaurant serving that many people you would think they would be on point. Sure they come and grab your plates quickly but when it came to actually getting food, that was a different story. Twice I had gone to get soup and there were no bowls. There was people hanging around waiting for bowls. I had to walk over to the ice cream section to grab one of the bowls from there. Also, when I went to get more food, there were many times that they hadn't refilled the trays. The sushi was also terrible here. And just the selection of food wasn't good. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffet me and my family often go to, they got very good deals, weekday you can get crab leg and sashimi for only 21:99 and on Sunday you also get lobster for only 25:99, you can also get birthday month free with 4 person bills. They got tons of selection   Including Japanese sushi,sashimi, Korean grills. The food was very delicious, I specially love the crab leg,pecking ducks, egg pudding also is my favorite desert. The severs is very friendly, they brought me a cake singing the birthday song for my ."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called \"Super Buffet\" as all of their plates are still branded with the old name. The sign at the entrance of the plaza still has the old  name as well. The inside of the restaurant is very tacky as if they did a quick renovation of the interior.  My expectations with chinese buffets are quite low so as long as the restaurant offers the basics, I'll give it a solid 3 stars. No chinese buffet in my mind should ever be above a 3 star. 

The buffet was only $16.99/person on Tuesdays. It offered a large variety of dishes: dim sum options, stir fry, noodles, rice, sushi and desserts. It was a standard offering, but it satisfied my hunger. Not much more to say besides the fact that they add MSG to their food as you'll be thirsty throughout your seating."}
{"text":"The food here is something you would get after a long night of drinking. It's poor quality but you get what you pay for cause it's cheaper than other Chinese buffets. It's just mehhh a restaurant that I wouldn't recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"The price may be cheaper than other buffets but you get what you pay for. The quality is cheap and there are tons of better options around in the GTA. Meals are free on your birthday if you have three other adults paying. However I still wouldn't come here on my birthday. I'd rather go somewhere else and pay full price."}
{"text":"Food 2/5 (50% of final grade)
Literally nothing special at all. It tastes like low quality buffet food, so there we go! The change in owners made the choices more limited, and less likable. This is definitely not an international buffet, and lean towards more of a Cantonese/pseudo-Japanese one. 

Ambiance 2/5 (15% of final grade)
The place wasn't noticeably dirty, so that's good! The rooms and tables weren't old or anything, but it wasn't a place you would want to stay long for. The ambiance might be appropriate for a cheap, super-casual Christmas dinner, but definitely not for any professional dinners or dates.

Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)
The service was nothing special for a AYCE. The dishes never piled up or anything, but the servers obviously DID NOT want to be there.

Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade)
On Tuesdays they have a special, and if you are simply out of ideas for any food at all, and want to spend an extra few mindless bucks for low quality food, go ahead. For its regular price, however, it's not worth it, pal, not worth it.

Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade)
Nothing in this experience deserved any brownie points. I should just casually mention here that the seafood bar was empty at around 8PM, with no restocking. 

Final Grade = 37.5/100 = 2 Dull Stars

TLDR: Blech."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price and a good selection. The new owners definitely renovated the place and it even has a new logo with a cartoon panda. The English name is changed to Scarborough Buffet, but the Chinese name is still fairly similar. The new interior is much more spacious and a better design than the previous owners. The seats and tables are quite clean, with the crab tool already set with some napkins. 

The service was good. Our server was very attentive with our table as he constantly checked to see if our hot water pot was empty or if we needed extra napkins. For the first time at a Chinese buffet, I didn't have to ask for napkins and the server already gave us two piles as needed! (Gold star for him) 

The food selection is a lot more than before. There is a variety of soups, such as the typical hot and sour soup, wonton soup, and corn and egg drop soup. However, they also have more tradional Chinese soups such as black chicken soup with longan. The sushi section was not bad and there was also salmon and butterfish sashimi, seaweed salad sushi and tofu sushi. The salmon sashimi wasn't the freshest but it was ok for a typical buffet.

Since I went on a Saturday night dinner during the long weekend, they also had a roasted turkey. As well, there was a spicy seafood mix. It reminded me of places like Boil King or Captain Boil where they have crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, and corn cooked in Cajun style sauces.

In addition, they had Peking duck with the wrap. You can make your own. The duck was sliced in front of you and they kept cutting more as needed. The wrappers are also steamed and very fresh. They were slightly thicker though, but still very tasty; not too dry and just the right chewiness.

The hot food selection was also your typical with a few additions like curry fish balls, lotus root and sugar snaps, and egg tofu. The previous owner made better curry fish balls. I would not recommend trying these curry fish balls as the balls were very powdery in texture and the sauce didn't taste very good.

There was also the cold crab and shrimp. The shrimp were quite large. They also had hot cooked Vancouver crab. The meat wasn't very fresh and the meat of the legs were very dry.

The dessert section is like your typical buffet with some cakes, pastries and ice cream. Nothing special and I didn't seem too appetized by the looks of it. 

However the fruit section was good. There was honeydew, grapes, oranges, pineapple (very sweet), and watermelon. In the grill section they have grilled pineapple, but it was very sour. They probably grilled all of the sour/not sweet pineapples and saved the sweeter ones for fresh fruit.

Don't expect a classy experience, but rather a casual meet-up with friends or family. The washrooms were also big and was clean. 

Beat the rush by going at around 6 PM. It got really busy around 7 PM and it felt like a battle for food. Even though the food was replenished at a fast rate, I'd like to take my time and choose my food. I will be back, for the price you're paying, it's not bad for a buffet."}
{"text":"I grew up coming here as a kid and have always been. There has been many changes at the restaurant over the years with renovations and changes to their buffet menu. To be honest, I think the quality and variety of the food has gone on the decline over the years. My family usually comes here to celebrate birthday and family gatherings so we've been a frequent customer here.  Although the buffet is cheap, you basically get what you pay for. In terms of selection, it's most a Chinese Buffet with all the essentials but not much variety of other cuisines. They do have a \"Create your own noodle station\" where you customized a bowl of noodles with your choice on style of noodles, toppings, sauces and soup base. The Noodle bar is okay but nothing amazing. In addition to a noodle bar, they also have a selection of sushi, food from the grill. The sushi selection is average with your common sushi rolls such as California rolls, salmon rolls etc... The food from the grill is decent with some short ribs and fried pork chops being the more satisfying dishes at that station. The desserts are decent with your typical basic selection of cakes, fruits and tarts. Nothing too special. For ice cream, they have your typical flavours such as mango, green tea, vanilla, strawberry and red bean. Service was average and the food was okay. Overall, if you want a cheap buffet, this is not a bad place to go to in Scarborough but you essentially get what you pay for. There are better buffets out there if you are willing to pay for me."}
{"text":"I have been here many time mostly for lunch because the best deal this place has is a take away container for 10 bucks and you fill it with that ever you want form the buffet. 

The buffet is quite diverse and has all the typical Chinese food favorites like fried rice, noodles, sweet and sour sauce, veggies like bok choy, baby corn, and broccoli. The selection of meats are the same  chicken, beef, and some sea food like shrimp and fish. Now the desserts are not the best a little bland but a Chinese buffet is not the place for desserts. 

Overall not a bad place to get a quick meal, or sit and see how mush of the buffet you can chow down. I will probably be back for a few more lunches."}
{"text":"note: previously named \"Super Buffet\" 
- less food options
- cold food
- servers eyeball you
- hella expensive 
- did i mention cold food ?

went here a few times before the change, and it was alright. i only really liked the steamed sweet egg and those long king crab legs (this is the place where i developed my hatred for medium-rare to rare meat OH GOD BIT INTO A PIECE AND BLOOD OOZED OUT DEAR GOD) 

so i went here with my family on Boxing Day and it was a huge disappointment. don't get me wrong some of the food actually tasted pretty decent like it ain't bad but ALL OF THE FOOD WAS LEGIT COLD like not a speck of heat to be detected like it looked hot but once it lands into your mouth it's like the North Pole hella cold. my dad was complaining the whole time and thing was, this buffet ain't cheap. im surprised no one ever complained like how can y'all just eat cold food IS IT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF SNOW OR WINTER WE HAVE IN CANADA WHY DO YOU CRAVE THE COLD?! anyways just a pretty upsetting buffet to eat at now after the change (and i was so excited too-_-) 

***they have pretty good mash potatoes (im a mashpotato fanatic) i got it every time i was looking for more food and legit the cookers were eyeballing me to the max (i think i took at least half of what they had LOOOL)"}
{"text":"I don't know if they're associated with the other two, but you could think of this place as the more budget version of Dragon Pearl or Dragon Legend. Food offerings seem similar, but decor isn't as nice.

This place is packed on their discount Tuesdays for lunch. Lineup to get in, crowds around the food islands, etc. They can't keep up with the crowds and often times the food you want is completely empty. When they do arrive with more food, even the staff have to yell \"EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME\" in order to get past the crowds so they can replace the food. As another reviewer commented on, the tables and chairs are all quite close together and it gives the place a cramped feeling.

Having said that, $11.49 for lunch on Tues or Fri is a decent price, and I'd probably come back if I'm in the mood for Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Can't complain the price for Tuesday lunch buffet. For the price you pay, there's a lot varieties and they are fresh, decent taste. I especially love the coconut dessert soup and breaded shrimp."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for a birthday dinner and lobster and duck that is included in the buffet. Something pretty rare to find. Even when offered usually are limited. The buffet itself was OK. Nothing great. More like Mandarin quality. The lobster was on the salty side but I really liked the duck. The choices were good and it changes it seems. I have been there twice and there were items that was added and subtracted from the buffet. They also have sashimi and some rolls. They were both just OK. Something expected in a buffet IMO.  I think one of the big downsides on this place is decor. It needs updating and I find it doesn't present food well. Utensils still has the previous name and you can tell it has been fairly used."}
{"text":"Sushi is bad. Everything else is pretty good. The place seems clean and servers behind the wok and lobster station are nice. But yeah, like I said, most of the sushi is not good so I wouldn't try it."}
{"text":"Was there on Father's day. Not worth going again. Lobster didn't taste like lobster. Wrong consistency and flavour. Most dishes were very bland. There were maybe one or two dishes worth eating."}
{"text":"Surprised how much I'd actually like this place. Cheaper than most Chinese buffets and the service is excellent; very attentive and quick! Been here a few times now and no complaints. 

I especially enjoy the sushi and sashimi; can't go wrong with AYCE salmon sashimi . Other foods are pretty decent; love how they have siu mai as well. Lobster does go quick on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I went to go get food and took a plate and realized that the plate wasn't even clean. I took another one and it was also unclean. The utensils were so unsanitary. There were also a lack of choice in food and many of the containers of food were close to being empty. This worker inpaticular was also very rude to me. I stood there wondering what I should eat (due to the lack of food choices and many of the containers being close to empty) and a worker comes and said \"Why are you just standing there, just move already\". Like what? The worker spoke in cantonese and acted like we wouldn't be able to understand, but we did. I ended up leaving to go to a different place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for a family dinner. 
The selection was good.  Among the large variety of food choices included dim sum, BBQ, and sushi.  Food ran out quickly, but they stations were refilled pretty fast.  In the dishes I picked, there was a lot of MSG, because I drank heaps of water. 

My favourite thing about this buffet is that there's a handwashing station before you enter the buffet area. Although it appeared underutilized while I was there, I am all for hand hygiene. 

Overall food was ok."}
{"text":"The infamous Tuesday lunch buffet specials! They offer the same Tuesday pricing on Fridays now too fyi! It's $12.49 + tax... sooooooo cheap!!

For the price, it's acceptable. Definitely am not expecting anything outstanding or of the utmost best quality. But it's def decent. 

The selection here is smaller than other places like Dragon Pearl and Dragon Legend. There's 2 hot tables, small sushi station, a cold table, soup table, and a dessert table. There's also a small station for made-to-order noodle soups and fried noodles. 

Some notable things were:
- Tofu pudding dessert- super soft!! Unexpectedly really good! 
- Fruits- it totally depends on the season, but today's fruits were amazing. All fresh and sweet! 

Service here was surprisingly really good! Food was being replenished at a decent pace. Waiters were very efficient in cleaning up the plates and were very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Okay gonna upgrade to 4/5 as it's well deserved.  We had a family gathering today for lunch and it was solid as all the guest really enjoyed themselves.  Even saw some unusual items like French quail eggs brullee which I've never seen anywhere before.  Salmon sashimi for lunch was a big surprise as well.  Current management has done a great job in improving the quality and service for this place and they definitely deserve a higher rating then it currently has.

4/5.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The buffet was pretty good. It is definitely a place to stuff your face for cheap. We went in as a group of 4 with a free meal since one of our group members had a birthday this weekend. The price was about 12.99 each, while Tuesday and Friday is 10.99 for lunch.
The variety of food was pretty good, plenty of variety to choose from. The waiters were very attentive and never had any issue dealing with the full room we were situated in. They filled up our cups and asked if we needed extra napkins and utensils.
The ambient lighting and the newly renovated restaurant made it a pretty good experience to dine in for lunch or dinner.
The trays were constantly filled so it is never really empty for the lunch rush.
Overall, I would go back when I'm in the area or if someone suggest a cheap buffet to stuff their face."}
{"text":"Food was good but the behaviour of the server were sooo bad....they don't even know how to talk to people decently"}
{"text":"So on weekends, you can get the a half lobster with the buffet.  Not the greatest quality as it appears the lobster was leftover from the previous day or was sitting there a while.  My tip is to cash in your lobster ticket only when they get a new batch and actually tell the lady which lobster half you want.

Plenty of crablegs at this place--you don't have to wait for it to come like some other places.  That said, it is about a 6/10 in terms of freshness.  Some other items I like were the salmon sashimi and california rolls, the Burbot fish steaks, the deep fried fish, and the whole shrimp coctail shrimp.  

Not bad for the money.  I've been here a few times over the years and the seating area was recently revamped but a little tightly spaced.  Service was excellent--always had people clearing your plates or getting you water.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Gotta rate Scarborough Buffet with a grain of salt because AYCE lunch was only $11.99!!!

Best part about my visit: bean curd soup with ginger syrup was quite good, servers were not terribly friendly but nonetheless polite and filled our water/cleared our table quickly, chicken wings, select sushi were OK, BBQ pork chop, cutlery was cleaner than I would have expected.

Could've been better: exiting the parking lot onto the main road may cause an aneurysm, the large chicken balls had a small shred of chicken in it, select sushi were not OK, and while I admire the table layout maximizes the amount of guests they can serve... little move to room when it's busy.

Not the greatest buffet but I can say 6 rounds of lunch and dessert later, I made every cent worth it for the price. 3/5"}
{"text":"Went for someone's birthday, food is alright, I mean you really get what you pay for. Wish they had more variety though. Service is okay, I've been to this place multiple times and every time I go it's a different name. Also the tables kinda close together so you don't have much room. 

The good: if you're birthday is within the month you go you're free. It's very cheap and affordable. 

Bad: Variety, quality & atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came to this buffet with my travel agency during the Victoria Day.

They offer variety foods. 
-BBQ
-Wok
-Hot soup

Ice cream isn't that good. Melting in the fridge.

The only bad thing happen is I got a dead ant in my soft drink. I gave to waitress for another cup. They didn't say any apology."}
{"text":"Previously called \"Super Buffet\". Went under renovations recently and now reopened as \"Scarborough Buffet\". The interior does look a lot better now, open-concept, very spacious and modern looking. Despite its reno, food selection and taste is pretty much the same.

Unlimited lobster and crab on Sundays!! Better grab some lobster 'cause those things go out quick!! Generally the crab is tasty however, today's batch appears to be lacking in flavour and over cooked. Didn't taste much like crab... more like a mush of paste...? Peking Duck was lacking as well. It wasn't as good as the first time I've had it. It also seemed like they stopped making the wraps or was just making them really really slow since I went back to the station several times and the trays were still empty.. 

As usual, the typical stir fry veges, noodles, fried rice, calamari, fries and curry fish balls were all still there. Surprisingly, they served pork hocks! Kind of disappointed though since the taste wasn't as aromatic as I'd like. They now have dim sum as well, your typical Ha Gow (shrimp) and Siu Mai (pork). The Ha Gow was not bad but the Siu Mao tasted like frozen dimsum you get at the supermarket. 

Soup station is still there and I think I thoroughly enjoyed their soups more than the \"main course\" foods. Can't really go wrong with the soups since they are all flavourful. They still have the sushi bar however, sushi is pretty mediocre; both taste and selection. Sashimi (salmon + white tuna) was not fresh at all but edible. 

Lastly, I think I enjoyed the dessert station the most. Had flang and it was delicious! Not too sweet but sweet enough to hit the spot. I also had a slice of cake which I believe it was cappuccino flavour. (I'm no cake enthusiast so some signs/tags would help...) Ofc, as a green tea lover I've got to have some matcha ice cream. Matcha ice cream was more on the sweeter & creamy side rather than matcha. I also got strawberry ice cream however, this strawberry flavour tasted so artificial that I couldn't even finish it. (Normally, I finish all my ice cream esp. strawberry!)

Overall, food selection and taste is mediocre. It'd be better if they have more sushi selection/variation and putting some more effort into the food's flavour/taste. Also, a lot of the foods were either sitting there for too long or just not being heated as I found my food to be cool/cold once I bite into it.
 
Service was prompt. Servers were always on the ball of cleaning up plates & refilling drinks!! Not a bad place to dine once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"New title: What a Difference Time Makes 
For a family gathering of about 10 of us we went for dinner a while ago where lobster was an extra menu feature. As a seafood lover, I was looking forward to dinner with a double whammy of crab legs and lobster.
Disappointed! An understatement.
Regular (usual suspects) items were mostly greasy and of poor quality and bland.
The crab leg offering was a mean display of scrawny specimens that weren't worth the time and energy to crack and split. My love of crab legs has no bounds, and they were so poor, I don't go for seconds. (I usually go for at least 2 heaping plates and eat little else)
A ticket was given out for the lobster, limit of 1 pp. Terrible! What a massacre of lobster tails! They were chewier than bubble gum - inedible.
The only thing I ate that was worth having was the run-of-the-mill sushi.
I honestly wouldn't go back, even if it was free."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at this place and they've had many reinventions since. Not too fond of their most recent one because of the main open concept room. 

For the food selection they have most of the essentials for a Chinese buffet but not a wide variety. The dessert bar also doesn't have many options. They only have ice cream, 4 choices of cake and finger food. 

Overall this place is convenient enough for parties or if you're just craving to eat a lot for a decent price."}
{"text":"Wasn't terrible, but not very good either. Everything was from decent to \"just a pass\". Although lunch wasn't expensive, you can use the same amount of money to get better Chinese food."}
{"text":"If you're looking to fill yourself up,  not really looking for the quality in food, a variety, and for the price of what you get, look no further. 

This place is one of the cheapest ayce Chinese buffets that I have been to, on a regular lunch day, it is $12.99 /adult. Their Tuesday special is even cheaper! At a whopping $10.99!! 

The service was ok.., felt really bad for the waiter since he was the only one working for a full room of people. He also had a cut on his hand.. Many used plates were piled on top of each other as he had no time to tend to us. 

You basically pay for what you get, so, the quality of food... is pretty bad."}
