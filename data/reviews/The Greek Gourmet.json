{"text":"LOVE IT!

There's a million places to get falafel and humus in squirrel hill, but as far as I'm concerned the rest can take a hike, this is my spot. Everything they sell is delicious - all the humuses (humi??!?), tabbouleh, falafel, gyros, pastisio, mousakka . . . my only problem going there is I leave with way too much food!

Also I really love family run businesses. My boy friend said he wasn't sure he likes Greek food. Grandma looked at him like he was stupid and told him to go wait outside. They have pizza next door for people who don't like Greek food. Love the food, and love that spicy granny too!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!
The gyros here are incredible! And huge! For $5, you can't beat it. Make sure to grab some extra napkins! I like the falafel too, but the gyros are best.

And the hummus?! Holy cow! I can't even begin to pick a favorite kind. Honey habanero? Buffalo? Cilantro jalapeno?? Last time I went, they were 3 for $10. That's a price that can't be beat, either! (The same homemade hummus from this place are sold in other stores in the area but are more expensive with a smaller variety).

You can buy ingredients and other stuff in the store, but I never have. There is only a small table or two inside the restaurant, so plan on taking your tasty lunch/dinner to-go.

The people who work there are incredibly nice. I heard somewhere that they do catering as well, but I'm not sure if that is true.

A gem in Squirrel Hill! Highly highly highly recommended. I recently moved away from Pittsburgh, but if I'm ever back, I'll be stopping here for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gotten a regular gyro here on several occasions and each time they have been excellent. $5 and you get so much meat and sauce! Plus the people there are really nice.

 I would give this place a 5 star rating but the place could use some cleaning and organizing. Kind of looks like a dump sometimes but the food is great!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about their outstanding gyros, I decided to give it a try. We ordered a lamb gyro, a chicken gyro, greek fries and a falafel sandwich. We loved the fries, falafel and the lamb gyro was the best I ever had. However, when we got to the chicken gyro, we were disappointed. We expected so much from it after the DELICIOUS food we just had. To our surprise, the chicken gyro contained  breaded chicken and spring mix. I don't know if all their chicken gyros are like that or we got that because they were out of chicken or may be just thought we would have no idea. So the overall experience started with a bang and ended a little bit disappointingly."}
{"text":"A little difficult to find this place since the location on yelp is a little inaccurate. But the chicken gyro is great!  Soft flatbread(and a little sweet?I like it), delicious chicken, good price. A little bit large, haha. The service is good, too."}
{"text":"Great, great place for cheap and authentic Greek food.

The special that probably catches people's attention is $5 for a gyro and can of soda.  Every time I get it I'm always surprised at how much there is.  I'm always full after that.

The hummus is definitely the best in the city.  It's all homemade and they change the varieties all the time.  One of my favorite parts of going there is sampling the different hummus they have on the counter.  I haven't found one I didn't like.

And everyone who works there always seems happy to see customers coming in.  Just a great place to get some great food."}
{"text":"The best 6 dollars gyro or falafel you can get.
Simply delicious."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Greek restaurant in Pittsburgh. The gyros are fantastic and I love the homemade humus that comes in a variety of unique flavors like curry, avocado, and buffalo.  Not really room to dine in, so it is much better as takeout."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in town! The BEST hummus! Fun atmosphere! Cheap takeout YUMMY YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This place is great and extremely convenient to most Squirrel Hill residents.  It really doesn't get any better than a $5 gyro and soda and I agree with the others Smoke White Bean Hummus or the Red Pepper Hummus is the way to go.

The atmosphere is quaint and they really make you feel at home the minute you walk in the door. The service is awesome and the people are always really nice. 

Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Best gyro that I've ever had! Filled with delicious, seasoned lamb meat. I've had many gyros in the Pittsburgh area and this is the best! The meat was also not greasy."}
{"text":"Since Grubhub won't let me update my review I decided to leave one here. There was an issue with my order so I left a poor review on grubhub. Seems there was a miscommunication between grubhub and the restaurant and the owner went out of his way to fix it. Very happy! What a great local place. I just wish I could modify my grubhub review."}
{"text":"Everything they make here is DELICIOUS! I have had all the sandwiches (falafel, gyro, hummus, eggplant) and different hummus flavours (spinach-feta, garlic, roasted red peppers, olive) and I enjoyed all of them! The sandwiches are very reasonably priced. But hummus is on the expensive side. They also have a few grocery items like pita bread, feta cheese and pomegranate molasse, and all are good quality."}
{"text":"To start off with, this place is tiny. There is only one table inside to eat at, which no one does...this is a typical grab-and-go Greek deli, with specials written on a board behind the counter. They have coolers stacked high with their food and sauces that they sell at wholesale? As well as a bakery case stuffed with spanakopita and baklava trays.
A young man was taking orders and making them. I felt bad for the guy. Yia Yia was bustling around the tight spaces, making sure everyone was content. I had to wait a while for my sandwich, but oh man...the wait was worth it. My gyro was piled high with lamb, a fresh spring mix, onions, and a very nice tzatziki sauce, no tomato! For only $5. 
I definitely recommend this place, though Yia Yia did hustle me to pay for my food when I was leaving, though I already had."}
{"text":"The gyros here are ginormous. They're the size of a chipotle burrito, but still cheap. Made to order and incredibly delicious. They also carry a bunch of unique humus favors and more olives than I knew existed. Only enough seating for four so don't expect to dine in."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Friday lunch when I'm working at home. The gyros are huge and a solid deal at $5. The lamb is standard and the chicken is breaded which is a little odd. The sauce is heavy on the dill which makes the gyro. 

The hummus is worthy of 5 stars. Always solid and lots of flavors to choose from. My father-in-law, who refused to eat hummus, gave the buffalo a shot and loved it. Too bad he lives all the way out in NH. Other great flavors we've had are siracha, Gorgonzola and chive, and olive."}
{"text":"I stopped by after work on the way home, and took my food to go (there's not a lot of dining space). I wanted to post a picture of my eggplant & feta sandwich, but I scarfed it down too quickly. It was SO good. While the sandwiches are awesome, the hummus is really what makes this place. The little fridges inside are chock full of baba ganoush, salads, drinks, and more types of hummus than you knew existed. They have a combo for a sandwich & 8 oz tub of hummus for $8, which I thought was a great deal."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Pittsburgh, 2nd best I have ever had in my life. They don't skimp on the meat, and the sauce is awesome"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that no one has commented on the Greek grilled cheese. HOLY DELICIOUS! Imagine melted cheesy deliciousness topped with their amazing hummus and greens with balsamic vinaigrette, all wrapped in their bread. I died."}
{"text":"Great gyro. I know it's not saying a lot but it was the best one I've ever had.  Loaded with everything you could want and more."}
{"text":"YUM!  This place's gyro special tastes like a gyro straight out of Europe!  And the closest thing to Doner Kabob you can get!   The yogurt makes the gyro great! The hummus is to die for (feta and sundried tomato is my fav).  Its a great place to stop for lunch!! 

don't forget to try the chocolate baklava too!"}
{"text":"The people who work here are really wonderful (especially that little stoner dude). Try the spanakopita. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim while in the area. Was greeted warmly by who I assume was the owner.  The woman who took my order did so while in the middle of her phone conversation--I really wish she would've completed the call first, I wouldn't have minded waiting. I ordered a gyro and a side of tabbouli. The gyro was huuugeee and so delicious! One of the best I've ever had. The tabbouli was good but not chopped finely enough, leaving long parsley stems making it hard to eat. They were doing some rearranging inside so I didn't get a good sense of what it's normally like. Otherwise, I'll be back to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered delivery on GrubHub from The Greek Gourmet and just finished eating. WOW. We each got a gyro and baklava and both were amazing. Easily the best gyros I've ever had, definitely the best in the burgh.

Gyros were overflowing full. Meat was thick, and not at all reminiscent of the many \"steakum\" esque gyros I've had before, and there was a lot of it. Lettuce was fresh greens and NOT iceburg. Pita was soft and durable without being chewy. tzatziki sauce was GREAT. Garlicky, refreshing, awesome.

The baklava was soft with a crisp layer on top, the nuts inside had softened a bit. It was sweet but not overpoweringly so. I went to school for pastry arts so I am CRITICAL of baked goods. And this excelled in every way.

Will definitely be going again. Next time to the actual store to see what it has to offer!"}
{"text":"Your stomach and your taste buds will thank you! Outstanding tasting gyros, and easy on the wallet. It's basically a chipotle burrito sized Greek goodness. The baked fries are also very tasty and only are two bucks with the purchase of a gyro. Overall, if you're ever in squirrel hill looking for a quick stop for lunch or dinner, look no further. A whole delicious meal for 8 bucks at that! I've gone three days in a row now for lunch :)"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place, located next to mineo's I've been right next to this place dozens of times and never gave it a look, boy was I wrong.  

The hummus is amazing, I love the roasted garlic and I'm a big critic of hummus and this place has to have the best I've ever had.  The staff is so nice and inviting and I really love their gyros.  I believe it is 5 bucks for a gyro and a drink and the gyros are a pretty good size.  One had me stuffed but satisfied.

In an area with so much to choose from this place is still original and has some great food and really friendly owners."}
{"text":"Love the gyros, they are huge and very yummy. I've had the falafel and chicken and like them both. Other favorites include the Jamaican Jerk hummus and the tabbouleh."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and I was pretty hungry. They say hunger is the best sauce. Moreover I love Greek food. I read all the amazing reviews on Yelp before picking this place. And I was in for a disappointment. May be I would be better off not reading all those reviews. I got the Eggplant Feta Wrap. It felt more sweet than usual. Sweet was the only flavor I could taste. Moreover the wrap was cold in parts - which was a turn off. The pita bread, although soft, was too small and the stuffing, lettuce, onion were all overflowing. The seating area was extremely small and cramped with other stuff. There are only 2 tables with two chairs at each of them. We hurriedly finished our food and left. I felt this place is overpriced for the amount of food they serve. Also, they serve in paper plates and plastic cutlery."}
{"text":"4.5! The hummus is SOOOOOOO good. Oh and I just had the most amazing gyro wrap there today too actually. I'm pretty sure it's family run, which is always nice. The space is a little small and old, but there are a few tables to enjoy your food there if you can't wait until you get home to eat (like me). 

We'll definitely be stocking our fridge with this place's hummus."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I can't stop thinking about when I'll be able to stop by for more. I consider this THE HIDDEN GEM of SQUIRREL HILL. Squirrel hill is so great because it is full of one of a kind eateries, but this one impresses me more than most. 

First, their food is so affordable and I really mean that. You can get a Chipotle sized gyro (+ way more meat) for $6. You can't beat that.

Secondly, they definitely have the best gyros I have ever had in Pittsburgh and arguably the best gyros I have had period. I get them with all of the fixings (spring mix, tomatoes, onion, cucumber sauce). 

Lastly, they have really awesome baklava, only a dollar a piece! I love sweet, drippy, honey filled baklava. Man, do they do it right!!! 

The only downside is they have essentially no seating and parking nearby can be a pain, but since my man lives a couple blocks away we just take it home."}
{"text":"This place is the best. HUGE portions, delicious, fresh, made to order. It is a family run business and they are adorable and lovely people, especially Yaya. I highly recommend the lamb gyro and the sun dried tomato hummus. Or the spinach and feta hummus, or the classic hummus, or the buffalo hummus, or the olive hummus... :)"}
{"text":"I could use some good 'ol home made hummus right about now!!!

i love hummus!!! 

There's over thirty different types of hummus at the Greek gourmet... I was so thrilled and sad... I wanted to sample every flavor but that was just impossible..lol 

Instead I bought a gyro...the gyro has the equivalent of their signature Greek hummus added with lots of sausages....they also put a  variety of spices and herbs along with their pita bread...There are too many veggies...it was so messy eating that huge sandwich!  however the gyro was tasty when served with everything...and they make homemade everything...defiantly get the hummus with the pita yummy!! area is pretty cramped...so get it and get it to go!"}
{"text":"I don't like sex but I'm really into FOREPLAY
As soon as it's over I usually SNOREPLAY
I get kinda pissy if she then demands MOREPLAY
I say \"no way, let's go to GREEK GOURMET\"

WHAT

What to get: Lamb Gyro (not chicken)
What not to get: Attacked by Squirrels

I didn't expect much from TGG. It's in a hipstery area (Squirrel Hill) and is making working man's food (Gyro) so I figured it would be a misappropriation. Plus it's a couple of dollars more than you'll pay for a Gyro at the stellar likes of Mike & Tony's or Gali's, which until now have been my faves in town.

I was shocked to find that the Gyro at TGG might actually be my fave in Pitt. In a City filled with Gyros, several of them excellent, for me to say that one might be the best of all is quite a big deal, as far as Gyros go. Because I'm kind of a big deal. And George Bush may not have a clue who I am, but Al Gore may.

The woman making it is super friendly, and I wish it were busier in here. Not too much in the way of seating, but you won't care when you try this sensational Gyro. Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll have to try some more of her delicious deliciousness. The food, I mean.

You also need to try their Hummus. Because Hummus have been love. But it's over now. It's where the water flows. It's where the wind blows.

Now more revelations about my sex life.

I covered her in S'mores, our name for that is SMOREPLAY
And when we're in Maryland we like to BALTIMOREPLAY
She charges for her time so you could say this is WH**EPLAY
But honestly I'd rather just go eat at GREEK GOURMET"}
{"text":"I have never liked gyros until I got a chicken gyro at this place and it was so delicious. The man who worked there was so friendly and helpful. Overall, if you have never tried this place, you should at least once."}
{"text":"The gyros are delicious.  The store is a pig pen!  I'm surprised they have a permit to remain open, the place is so dirty and in disarray with stuff all over the place.  I put my hand on the counter, and lifted it up with grease attached to it."}
{"text":"This is the best  Greek take out in Pittsburgh. I usually get $5 Gyro that has very generous topping which also comes w a free drink. A true hidden gem."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying the Greek Gourmet for over a year and half, but I just made it in a few weeks ago.  The prices are crazy reasonable, and the employees are super friendly.  My experience:

Lamb Gyro ($5)- The lamb meat and pita were spot on.  Diced tomatoes were great.  The tzatziki sauce was unique.  I was not a fan.  It was a very heavy and creamy sauce, almost like ranch dressing.  It also seemed to have a salty feta taste almost.  It was very unique.  Similar to Laura M, I found the spring mix off-putting and very messy.  I would have much preferred romaine.  A 2.5 star gyro.

I want to go back and try the gyro again with a slight variation.  The girl behind me ordered hers without sauce but with hummus.  I think this is the way to go.  So I would recommend trying a lamb gyro with tomatoes and hummus.  They also have a frequent gyro card, and if you buy 10, you get one free!

Small Red Pepper Hummus ($3.50)- Spectacular.  I will be coming back here to buy more hummus.  They had about ten flavors.  I also tried the plain hummus, and it was super delicious.  Some of the best hummus I have ever eaten.

The employees were exceptionally friendly and upbeat and really seemed to like working there.  This is a take out only place and more of a market than a restaurant.  They also accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have had mostly great experiences with the Greek Gourmet. Their hummus is phenomenal. So is their Gyro. Great value. Their falafel sandwich is also great. My favorite hummus is the smoked white bean- FANTASTIC!!

Unfortunately I was prompted to write this review after a sub-par experience this afternoon. I went with a friend- I ordered a gyro and she ordered falafel with no onions.

My gyro came out and it was delicious as usual. I did have to go outside to get a paper towel, as the towel dispensers on the inside tables and counter were all empty. I finished eating my gyro and the falafel still hadn't come out. Eventually the young man working apologized for having forgotten the falafel- it burnt and he had to make another batch.

After a while the falafel came out. At this point my friend and I were eager to finish up and leave, so when she noticed there were onions she opted to just pick them off. Upon further inspection, this batch of falafel was very undercooked. Still not bad, she continued eating. Getting to the last bite, my friend noticed a dead fly on the lettuce hanging out of her sandwich. We got up to pay and my friend intended to mention the fly. A line formed behind us while we waited at the counter to pay, as the man cut gyro meat and the woman took inventory of hummus. The young man put his knife down, licked his fingers, and took my money. My friend did not want to mention the fly in front of the other customers. When I tried to subtly get the attention of the older woman she seemed distracted, so we finished paying and walked out.

I don't like reading reviews like this- highlight reels of disappointment- nor do I enjoy writing them. But my hope is that someone from GG will see the review and take it into consideration. Your employees should take pride in serving such great food, and this means paying attention. I did not feel like anyone was paying attention to quality, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction today. The paper towels, the burnt falafel, the undercooked falafel, the onions, the fly, the finger licking and not once were we asked how everything was.

Again, I love this place and I hate to write a frustrated review. But today's visit was a major disappointment. If this was a normal experience, I am quite sure The Greek Gourmet would not exist. I'd hate to see you go. So please, for the love of hummus, keep it clean and stay gourmet!"}
{"text":"I Came here after looking at the stellar reviews this place had. I was somewhat disappointed and hence am giving just three stars. 

I got a chicken gyro, which was okay. There was too much of lettuce and onions and they were falling out. I felt there was too much onion, which gave the gyro a very oniony flavor. The gyro itself was not that big (I was expecting a huge one because one of the reviews said so). It's really easy on the pocket, so no issues in that front. 

The seating is also not that great. There are only two tables, with two chairs each, not facing each other. My fiancé and I found it a little awkward. We could see a lot of open space behind the counter, which could be easily used to increase the seating area. 

Wouldn't really recommend, unless you're running low on funds and don't mind take out."}
{"text":"This place is a top deal! Best wraps and hummus in Pittsburgh.  It's homemade too.
If you go to Whole Foods Market,  East End Co-OP, Coffee Tree Roasters, and others,  you can get their hummus,  and other products. 
Deals only at the home location on Murray Ave.
You'll get a lot of food there,  and the price IS right!
Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by today around 12:30 to grab a gyro for a quick on-the-go lunch.  I asked if they had chicken gyros, to which the guy behind the counter said, \"Yeah, I can make you one.\"  Nonplussed, I said okay, and he rung me up for $5.

After standing around for a couple of minutes, I saw the guy who waited on me get a hunk of meat out, unwrap it, and put it on the broiler.  Noticing that the bus that I needed to catch would be there in 3 min., I asked him if my chicken gyro would be ready soon.  He assured me that it would, and then proceeded to assemble it and put it on a panini press.  When he gave me the finished product, I rushed out the door and managed to catch the bus just in time.

Once on the bus, I unwrapped the gyro and proceeded to eat it.  Upon inspection, it was large in size and bulky, and contained some surprising ingredients.  Instead of iceberg or romaine lettuce leaves, it was topped with spring mix, and I didn't detect any tomatoes in it at all--or fries.  The biggest surprise was the meat, however, which consisted of breaded chicken strips, most likely of the previously frozen variety.  This is the first time I've ever bitten into a gyro with crunchy (crispy?) meat.  The gyro also contained a generous helping of tzatziki sauce, which was applied between the meat and the spring mix.  Unfortunately, it lacked the zip that's the hallmark of a well-made tzatziki, and its plentifulness made for messy eating, esp. without napkins, which I forgot to grab when beating a hasty exit to catch the bus.  Overall, the flavor wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I'm accustomed to in a gyro.

I'd be willing to give this place another try for the hummus, since that's what everyone seems to rave about here, or perhaps a pastry, since their selection looked good.  For gyros, however, I'd recommend checking to see if the broiler is in use before ordering--at least, for the chicken variety, if you don't want to risk getting a gyro made with crispy chicken strips.  For a solid chicken gyro containing standard ingredients and meat sliced from the spit, I recommend Lesvos in the South Side.  Based on the positive reviews, I must confess that I expected better."}
{"text":"I've tried at least seven different types of hummus here, and they've all been great. My favorite is the red pepper hummus. They usually have a three for $10 deal, so you can try out a few different flavors. 

Prices overall are very reasonable, and the spanakopita and baklava are great. The staff is very warm and welcoming, and Yia Yia is adorable."}
{"text":"For the amount of money I paid, I was not expecting the size of the gyro sandwich that I got. That meant I was regretting getting a combo with fries (which by the way, were very good), because I was definitely struggling to finish the whole meal. The gyro and vegetables were definitely sticking out, maybe halfway, of the pita bread wrapped around it all. Everything was super tasty, albeit a bit messy, and you get your full value here. The quality of the meat is probably not the best I've ever had, but it's above average, especially for the price. The baklava for a buck sealed the deal as well."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Greek Take Out Ever !
I ordered the Greek Salad with Gyro Meat. And not only was it GREAT , But very reasonably priced and BIG. All the ingredients are fresh , and the staff is friendly and fast.
I will be back to get the world famous Gyro and Hummus, but for now , i'm full.
You have to give this place a try. I don't think you will be disapointed."}
{"text":"Great gyro and hummus. I don't know much about Greek food, but the gyro tasted great and so is the hummus. Gyro was filled with field greens, tomato and onions. There was enough meat for 2 lunches for me. And for $8.5 a set, it's a great deal in the area. 

Fries were on the softer side. It's not the crispy ones I was expecting. But perhaps the baked ones were a healthier option. 

Hummus was good too. My wife thought it was too spicy, but I thought it was alright. 

Not a big fan of Greek food, but I will stop by again if I wanted a gyro."}
{"text":"Delicious hidden gem! Amazing prices, amazing staff, fantastic food. The gyro is huge and will keep you full all day.

I like the traditional gyro (lamb) better than the chicken!"}
{"text":"Great gyros! You get a great portion with the meal and the taste is great! I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Love The Greek Gourmet! You can get a gyro and drink for $5! You don't have to get the standard Gyro-any of their Gyro sandos are only $5-which is a steal if you are in a pinch for dinner or lunch. Also-they are DELICIOUS! In addition to yummy gyros and friendly service they have a variety of hummus choices. MMMMM. 
If you are a lover of hummus like me you will super like this. The hub's favorite was honey habanero, my personal fave was spinach and feta hummus-but the gal at the counter let us know they come out with seasonal treats and will soon be having a sweet potato hummus- I'd try it :)

The only down side to this place is there is only a small seating area (like one bar with two stools) so get it to go an enjoy it in one of Pitt's fabulous parks or come with a small party!"}
{"text":"Not like this place needs more good ratings but what the heck.. Just delicious food! I've had the gyro (both meat and chicken) and it's so good- high quality meat + wrap, filled with nice veggies, and amazing tzatziki sauce. Also, their smoked humus is incredible, as is their babaganouj. Grape leaves- yum! I've also had their baklava- excellent! Seriously, everything here is good."}
{"text":"Sincerely a gem and delight. Unbelievably fresh unbelievably flavorful. A cornucopia erupting with flavor onto ones palette with violence and grace"}
{"text":"Great variety of delicious hummus but my favorite here has to be the baked falafel.. Baked falafel is so hard to come by and the tahini sauce served with it is really nice. Spanakopita is excellent as well. Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"The first time I stepped into this little shop, I rudely interrupted a very elderly woman minding her own business behind the counter while singing Barry White's Can't Get Enough Of Your Love Baby. After this moment I knew I'd be coming back to this place.

Things I like:
-various imported items like rose water, different olive oils, flours
-great selection of hummus and appetizers in their refrigerators
-I really enjoyed their two different kinds of gyros. They're both packed, are heavy enough to suffice as ad hoc dumb bells for bicep curls (a perfect exercise right before a feast), and the tzatziki sauce is rich, substantial, well-seasoned.
-the lamb is very tender and also well-seasoned. However, I can't help but wonder whether the meat is really lamb or something more processed. Perhaps it's the texture of the lamb...

Things I didn't like:
-small seating area
-for the chicken gyro, it is a breaded chicken breast that tastes more like something that was taken from the freezer section of a grocery store. Regardless, it was still tender, well seasoned and the gyro overall was very tasty!

Together, I believe for the price this is a solid place to get incredibly delicious gyros, chicken or lamb."}
{"text":"Our first experience with The Greek Gourmet was for lunch on a Sunday in July. My husband got a gyro, and I got a \"small\" salad with the meat on top. Sooo good! The tzatziki is absolutely delicious. I don't know how he finished his gyro, it had so much meat in it. The salad fed me two meals, and I still had enough meat left over to make a sandwich. Only downside was that the restaurant was hot inside (and hot outside too of course), so we ended up getting our food to-go and found a shady place to eat it. The service from the employee manning the store was so-so.

Then last week we picked up a tub of smoked white bean hummus to eat with veggies for a party. It was life changing. We're officially fans! Can't wait to try the baklava."}
{"text":"As I open the door, the air is smokey with burnt gyro meat. The kid behind the counter has Trust playing on the speakers. I order a falafel sandwich for $6, and he makes me a 2lb sandwich, which is very tasty. Thanks dog"}
{"text":"If you don't work in Squirrel Hill, I feel bad for you son. Just kidding. Kind of. Not really.

Greek Gourmet on Murray Ave is my goto move for lunch. $5 for a gyro AND a drink is the best deal in the city. Can't be beat neither. Their gyros and Greek salads are fresh and generous. 

Also, if you like hummus, they have a selection to die for. Personal favorites are their buffalo hummus and spicy avocado. 

Staff is super friendly, Mike & co are great! Be sure to get a punch card! 10 gyros and the 11th is free!"}
{"text":"Got a gyro, on the plus side, gyro was huge. Negative side, lamb wasn't fresh off of the skewer. Instead it tasted like the meat was sitting in water. The gyro didn't have lettuce it had field greens. I prefer lettuce. The sauce wasn't that great either. So huge gyro but definitely disappointing."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've had in years... for $6.00. Nice people, good portions, and no nonsense. Just delicious food."}
{"text":"Go for one reason and one reason only- The many types of excellent hummus. Every flavor I have had is good and I will update further once I've worked my way through the whole menu.

The other items are meh. 
The service is always warm and there are always new samples to try."}
{"text":"Very tasty gyro. It gets stuffed full of meat, vegetables, and sauce. Honestly, the stuffing full is what brings it a bit shy of 5 stars. While I appreciate the attention to quantity, the sandwich disintegrated in my hands before I could finish it, which made for a very messy lunch."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place ... but the chicken on the GYROS is FRIED and on the salads .. it looked like it was microwaved chicken as well .. like not good at ALL.. it doesn't say anywhere in the menu this is breaded .. most places it's always grilled ( any other Greek place..) they forgot fries which was fine I just went back in .. but the fries were not even cooked the whole way .. they were almost raw .. I had a feeling when they were in the bag cause they were so heavy when I carried them to my car ( I was thinking these don't even feel cooked the whole way ..) .. they just tried to rush them because they forgot them and didn't let them cook ... so we had to cook in our air fryer when we got home . Only reason I gave 3 stars is because everyone was nice there ... so maybe their gyro meat is the thing to get there but I would never ever order chicken from there again ... and if I did order fries again hopefully they will be cooked ( if they don't forget them ) .. very disappointed ..THEY REALLY NEED TO DISCLOSE THIS IS BREADED CHICKEN ON THE MENU ."}
{"text":"A welcoming family run business specializing in Greek food. They have the most diverse selection of hummus that I have ever seen: cilantro jalapeño, artichoke, sweet potato, habanero, and many others flavors. They also sell Greek desserts, olives, pita bread, and other Mediterranean specialties.

The menu is simple which makes it easy to decide what to eat. I opted for a gyro. The pita was packed with meat, romaine lettuce, and a Greek tomato & onion salad. The sandwich was flavorful and refreshing. It was the best gyro that I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm going to say the magic four words again: Smoked white bean hummus! Smoked white bean hummus!

Get it. Enjoy it. It's one of the things I'll miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This is not an exaggeration.

The staff here is super nice, and the baklava and the shredded wheat pastry (kataifi?) are the perfect size if you just want a lil' bit of something sweet. While it's no $5 footlong, I'll take Greek Gourmet's sandwich special over Subway's any day."}
{"text":"Great gyro and great service...I've had baklava before but the crap that comes in a box at SAMs club...I didn't really like the SAMs club version but I got to try some from this place...wow!!! Totally changed my outlook on the desert...it was like eating honey paper with walnuts...they heated it up just enough that it was ooey and delicious..mmmh
Gyro was awesome...lots of meat and veggies too...great cucumber sauce ...a lil sloppy tho.,.like a sloppy Jo Ill call this one a sloppy go...haha"}
{"text":"First off, the gyros here are good, and at five bucks, they are a strong value. The meat appears to be baked, sliced and grilled as opposed to spit-roasted and shaved, so the consistency is closer to meatloaf. Although I prefer the spit-roasted variety, the flavor is still very good. The rest of the sandwich was okay. Good pita, but the greens were basically a bunch of spring mix (tasted too strongly of beet) with too much tzatziki. The whole thing was sort of hastily assembled and didn't physically hold up. That would be okay if we didn't wait so long for the thing.

Even before the lunch hour, our wait was very long. There was a single person working here and it showed. They were out of stock on sodas and it took about five minutes before they even knew we were there. The space itself needs repair: broken floor tile, damaged veneer, a mopping. I hate to bag on a small family-run business like this, but that stuff has to be taken care of and the service needs to be faster. I would pay more for that."}
{"text":"Cutest little place and the friendliest service! I got some falafels to go and the original hummus and it was all delicious! I love that the woman here poked little holes on the top of my falafel box! I hate going to a place to get falafel to go and the box is fully closed because the heat from inside steams the falafels and then they are soggy when you go to eat them. CAN'T stand that!

Loved this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The gyros are not bad here - and if the sweet grandma makes it for you, they're huge! Otherwise they're a normal size, which is still very filling :). $5 with a can of soda. They have alot of different hummus flavors for purchase here too. 

Also, can everyone please stop calling them jai-roes?"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for some time, and I'm definitely not disappointed!! 

I got the lamb gyro with hummus--only $8.50, and they make the hummus in house! 

The gyro was made fresh and quickly, and they have a wide variety of different kinds of hummus to choose from. I love that they make it there and the fact that there are literally so many options!! I'm definitely going to come back because I'm going to start craving their hummus again soon."}
{"text":"Craving some Greek food, I ordered the gyro and jalapeno hummus for lunch through a food delivery app last week. The gyro was unexpectedly gigantic which was both good and bad. Good because you get a lot for what you pay for. (Half was enough to get me full.) Bad because they stuffed so much meat in there that I had to take out about 25% of it just so I could hold it in my hands and start eating. (Sorry no photos because I was too busy figuring out how to eat the gyro.) The meat was savory though! I also enjoyed the jalapeno hummus. I liked that it was just a bit spicy but not too overwhelming for hummus."}
{"text":"Some of the best hummus I have ever tired exists at Greek Gourmet. The store is literally a block away from my place, so I am very lucky to have such a great Mediterranean one-stop market so close by. They have a variety of different kinds of hummus. I like the smoked bean hummus and the hummus with horseradish. When you first walk in, the smell of fresh olives overwhelms you. This is olive heaven! Much much better olive selection compared to Giant Eagle up the hill at a lesser cost. I need to try out their prepared pastries and desserts the next time I go, which should be in the very near future. Overall, a really great Greek market for a mid-sized city."}
{"text":"Holy moly... first time trying a gyro & I refuse to go anywhere else!!! My husband use to travel to get his fav meal but now he is just as in love with this place as am I!!!! Wonderful customer service (I wish I got the young gents name) and spot on preferences! We will forever return!"}
{"text":"This was a good place for a quick and good gyro. It was cheap, quickly made, and tasted great. I wasn't a huge fan of the stuffed grape leaves, but they were decent. The humus was also really good!"}
{"text":"This place supplies hummus to most of Pitt. Best place to takeout a hummus wrap or falafel any day. Also look out for 3 hummus packs for $10 deal with one of the widest range of delicious hummus.
Fresh food, great taste and best value for money !"}
{"text":"Visiting the area, and not sure where to eat we turned to Yelp. The Greek Gourmet seemed to be the one place to tickle everyone's fancy. 

This may be a little hole in the wall, but the food pacts big flavor. I got the chicken gyro. One of the most tasty wraps I have had. Upon opening the package I must admit I was intimidated. It took me a solid minute to figure out how to eat it. The wrap was seriously huge.  I finally decided to eat some of the filling with a fork, then pick up the rest. The chicken breast was moist, while being both sweet and savoury.  The pita bread was soft and chewy. All the produce was fresh. While the wrap was dripping with sauce, it wasn't too much. 

My husband enjoyed his traditional gyro. Everything was the same as mine, except his had lamb. My eldest son got a hummus wrap. As someone who loves hummus, the wrap was perfect for him.

This is really intended to be a grab and go establishment. Seating is extremely limited. There are only  two tables. Each table only has two chairs. Don't let this stop you. Grab some amazing Greek food, and let it bring some delicious-ness to your day."}
{"text":"I love the Greek Gourmet. Their hummus is the best hummus I've ever had. I love when they pop up at the Squirrel Hill Farmer's market...I am known to come home with three tubs of hummus at a time! I typically order their Greek Salad as a meal, which is rather larger for the price and I appreciate all of the love that goes into making the salad perfect. They also have a loyalty card!"}
{"text":"Holy hummus batman!!

I mean, it's like a hummus party and everyone's invited.  Seriously, if you're a true friend you would invite everyone to this hummus party because it's so good!  Apparently with over 20 kinds of hummus, you can please them all.

I tried a plethora of different ones but loved the buffalo, garlic and horseradish one the best.  I went home with the horseradish and have been happily eating it every day since.  Man does that horsey sauce give you a kick in the butt, but it's goooood!

I also had a gyro with all the fixin's.  The pita bread, soft and chewy.  The lamb, loads of it and nice and moist, no dry meat here!  The sauce (maybe to me one of the most important parts) was awesome!  Love me some cucumber yogurt greek sauce... load me up with it and I'm good to go!  Plus, it's cheap cheap cheap, with gyro's at around $5 and the hummus being around $3.  You won't break the bank with this lunch/dinner/snack!

It's a family run business and the owner is SUPER friendly and easy to talk to.  it's so awesome to see an owner that's so passionate about the business and happy to be there.  

I know I'll be back for my stock of hummus, I'm hooked and I can't turn back now!!"}
{"text":"Paid $5 for a giant, delicious gyro.  I've eaten my fair share of gyros and this one tops the list.  Tons of meat, fresh tomatoes, fresh pita, and delicious tzatziki. And they have a huge selection of homemade hummus.  We bought the jalapeño-cilantro, spicy avocado, and horseradish.  They were all great, but the horseradish really stood out.  Want to try to jerk hummus and curry hummus next.  Definitely a gem."}
{"text":"The Greek Gourmet is the go-to place for hummus.  Forget Trader Joe's, forget Whole Foods, definitely forget Giant Eagle.  All their hummus is made in-house (yes apparently there's a difference between something made in-house and something that's housemade; housemade can be made in someone else's house).  They have their hummus out for you to try before you buy it.  Apparently they also are one of the sources of hummus for Whole Food's, as they were out of their smoked white bean hummus the last time I went (its absolutely delicious and the smokiness reminds me of a summertime cookout).

Most of their pastries are made in-house; their meat, cheese, and spinach pies are shipped in though.

They also have other things like pastas and olive oils and what not, but I'm always drooling over their prepared foods to notice anything else."}
