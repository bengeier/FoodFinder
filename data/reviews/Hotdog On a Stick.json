{"text":"I have loved this place since college. Okay maybe not this exact location. =) The lemonade is always just right not too tart nor sweet. Turkey hot dogs, I can't taste the difference. So are they still good for you when they have been battered and deep fried? 

Oh I forgot the best part, I still giggle every time I see the girls making the lemonade."}
{"text":"Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality."}
{"text":"They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)"}
{"text":"This place was the best pace in town to get a corndog. The lemonade is always spot on and has me and everyone else coming back for more. I feel like I am at the state fair everytime that I visit this place. Corndog a lemonade and some funnel cake! Woop woop!"}
{"text":"Veggie dogs-yes
Customer service-no

If I were to write a script on what not to do in a customer service setting, it might just start like this:

The setting: Hot Dog on a Stick in a lonely, desolate mall

Enter Cashier, standing at register, notices customer and runs to answer the ringing phone

Cashier proceeds to engage in phone call about Vegas and getting her shift covered while watching customers standing at register

Cashier makes no attempt to make phone call brief and once completed, shoots her arms in the air with a joy of exclamation, then acknowledging the customer and bubbling about how happy she was to get her shift covered so she can go to Vegas. Cashier further elaborates on how she plans to get to Vegas, and how she went to high school there.

Customers ask for two veggie dogs

Cashier grimaces in disgust and disbelief, with an expression of \"seriously?\" or \"really?\"

Customers are flabbergasted by inept customer service and stammer out a \"yes\" with eyebrows raised.

Cashier then indicates that she's never actually tasted one and starts to backpeddle when customer explains that they really don't taste so bad.

After more discussion about Vegas, cashier apologizes and perhaps starts to think...

Customers receive veggie dogs and ask for relish and Gulden's mustard, because they have seen them at every other HDOAS.

Cashier displays disgust and questions the use of relish, but manages to find it. The Gulden's is out of the question. 

End scene with customers wondering where the hidden cameras were."}
