{"text":"The quick lunch combo is usually awesome, though the soup is questionable. Today I ordered a French onion soup and was so unimpressed. I was given a piece of toast with a thin slice of cheese and a side of salty broth. Not at all what I was expecting and not in a good way."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and all 3 times the food has been consistent and highly recommend it to my friends and family! Love the decor and nice environment of the restaurant.  I love how the menu has South indian as well as the italian mix, I can't wait to order the take out and have it at home!"}

   Menu is extensive
   Food is awesome

We went at noon. Since they just opened on July 2015 fairly new...not a whole lot of people know about this hidden gem.

They serve different kind of cuisines.  Since we ate buffet I was not able to skim thru the menu. 

On top of my head they do serve east Indian,  Sri Lankan,  Chinese etc.

Now, the food.....yuuuum
The butter chicken is not as fattening like the others, the chicken are sparingly served. The saffron rice...love it. The pasta was really good, I really love the pasta, oh and the potato with peas...a kick to it...yummy.

The chefs comes out and see how the guests likes the food as well as check the quantity of food. 

They also have sweets. Though I didn't try it, my sister and friends did and they love it.  Apparently it's home made. Since I didn't eat it I don't know what's it's called. :(

The place is by 37 street s.w. close to grey eagle casino, gotta do the merry-go-round thingy heading west and I think it's 2 blocks, there's a town center with 7-11 store, world health center, doctors clinic, a bar. They are right at the corner close to 7-11. 
I would definitely go again. I hope this review and photos of this new restaurant helps. 

The buffet is $13-15."}
