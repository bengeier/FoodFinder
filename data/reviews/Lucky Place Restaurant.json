{"text":"Tucked away in a quiet corner of a Chinatown mini mall is a restaurant brimming with Sino-Canadians... Lucky Plate. From what I could glean from the menu and what was on people's tables, LP is like the Humpty's of Chinese food. Not any particularly identifiable cuisine, but a moderately priced place where families go to eat together. Lots of platters of sautéed vegetable with a steamed chicken or unidentified curd on top, some plain rice on the side. Seems like a good spot for those with ulcers. The salt and pepper squid was very tender, but the batter too thick and bready, making it lack the awesome crispness of somewhere like Hi-ball. They provided hot sauce on the side, a nice addition I took full advantage of. Overall though, there are plenty of spots in Chinatown with more interesting menus for all tastes."}
{"text":"Although not easy to find, the food was excellent.  The portions are large and we could not finish all the food despite it trading so good."}
{"text":"????????????????,???????they said my view is too short, just make it longerrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"While the sum can be greater than its parts, if the parts are really poor quality, the sum cannot be much better, and that is the case with this restaurant.  The chicken was undercooked and seemed to be almost exclusively unappealing slimy pieces of dark meat.  The low quality of the chicken in the chicken and corn soup could not be hidden by being extremely finely diced.  The chicken was well hidden in the starch in the chicken balls.  The beef sate had no hint of Thai peanut sauce - we wondered if the spelling was incorrect and if it was supposed to be saute. Regardless, the beef in that under-seasoned dish was well hidden by red and green peppers.  The only flavor/ingredient that consistently came through was grease."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem of a restaurant.  It is our favorite place to go with a larger group of 8 or more.  Everyone always loves their peking duck and the sweet pineapple pork served inside half a pineapple shell and they also have the best honey garlic ribs.. But if you wish to go on  Friday or Saturday night btween 5:30 & 8:30 make sure you make a reservation as the place is always packed. You always get a free chinese dessert of the day when you go in the evening.  We also enjoy their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I'm unique in that I like Chinese food but I have a sesame allergy and have to be careful whenever I go out to eat it. I've had multiple occasions where I've been assured my food does not have sesame in it, but then it turns out it does. Here, I told the staff about my allergy and found them to be so accommodating and understanding that I felt completely safe (and needless to say I did not have an allergic reaction).  As for the food itself, I came here with a large group of people and we ordered a variety of dishes. Among other things, we had:  Sweet and Sour Pork in a Pineapple Salt and Pepper Eggplant Salt and Pepper Squid Shanghai Rice Vermicelli Special Fried Noodles  All of the food was excellent. More authentic tasting and far less greasy than Chinese food in Calgary tends to be. The eggplant was a favourite of mine, and the big hit at the table was the Sweet and Sour Pork in Pineapple. I had such a good experience here that from now on whenever someone asks for a recommendation for Chinese food I'm telling them to go to Lucky Place Restaurant. And if I ever find myself in Chinatown looking for good Chinese food, this is where I'm going."}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto, I was beginning to get delirious trying to find good authentic Chinese food once I moved here. Chicken balls, sweet and sour, and all of that other nasty Canadianized garbage just doesn't cut it with me, and Calgary seems to be overrun with places that only serve that. Luckily (ironically), Lucky Place is a delicious, authentic, and reasonably priced Chinese restaurant. The staff were very attentive and the food came quickly. My favourite items were the hot and sour soup, sautéed chicken with jellyfish, and salt and pepper eggplant. The others in my party ordered a vegetable dish that I can't remember the name of, but was fantastic. It had some of the freshest gai lan in it that I've ever eaten.  The place is easy to miss because it is tucked into a quaint mall, but up the stairs and through the double doors is one of Chinatown's best-kept secrets.  Also, it's always a good sign when you're the only white guy in the entire restaurant. Everyone and their mothers (literally) was Chinese. They wouldn't be eating here if wasn't good."}
{"text":"Gem of a find. After over a week with no rice, we all craved something like this. It was hard to find (located in heart of Chinatown) but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. New owners have taken over but the menu is the same.    I still like it for chicken or century old egg congee, rice-wrapper doughnut, and chow mein dishes like the beef chow fun and Thai style noodles. Inexpensive lunch specials.   I hear the food is even better for dinner, peking duck (advance noticed) crab, and on Instagram I saw some speciality chicken and taro dish. I'm pretty sure you need to speak Chinese to order these dishes or show them a picture. The female owner is quite friendly so I'm sure they would accommodate you if can't speak Chinese."}
{"text":"I've come by here and ordered to go a few times, but this is actually the first time I stopped in to eat. Stopped by for a very late lunch around 2:30PM today and was the only one in the restaurant, but the lady was really nice and was quick to provide tea and took my order quickly.  I got a beef flat noodle with gravy (i.e. the wet stir fried noodles) and they were great. Flavorful yet simple sauce, just crisp tender Chinese broccoli, a little beef and a nice heap full of noodles. Considering how expensive parking is around Chinatown, its nice that their lunch specials are pretty cheap relative to some other restaurants. Would gladly come here again!"}
{"text":"A no frills restaurant that opens late in Chinatown, and accepts credit cards!  Authentic, great dishes. Wok hay was very good, fish tofu clay pot came out super piping hot.   Bittermelon soup and snow fungus sugar water dessert were both complimentary:)  Waitress and we made small talk comparing our home places. In heart, still same race, inbuilt understanding and community."}
{"text":"Average Chinese food from a US perspective - the 'spicy' Sichuan shredded pork and chicken were imperceptibly hot bordering on mild. If you are from the US be mindful when you pay your bill with a credit card you are given the option to pay In Canadian or US dollars - Rip-off alert - Unspecified is that the merchant sets the exchange rate for US dollars which is only noted after you receive the bill."}
{"text":"Lucky find in Lucky Place Restaurant!  This is as authentic as you can get for a Chinese restaurant.  This used to be the first Double Greetings Restaurant from years ago.  The owners of Lucky Place Restaurant are the 2 former head chefs of the old Harbour City Restaurant in Chinatown.  We decided on an early dinner and we ordered: - Gai Choy with Salted Duck Egg Soup - soup was tastily seasoned and the Gai Choy, pork slices and the salted egg added depth to the soup - Shrimp Balls with Vermicelli Hot Pot - piping hot pot with delicious shrimp balls lightly deep fried with vermicelli and chopped up onions and peppers that enhanced the dish - Green beans with minced pork - green beans were tender and cooked so well with the minced pork - Shrimp in salted egg sauce - OMG!  So good!  That sauce is to die for! - Rice  Hot dessert for free - Red Bean Soup - Very, very good.  Wait service - very good; speaks English and Cantonese."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Everything was solid, service was a bit lacking since they were busy. Typical Chinese dinner at most places. We ordered three dishes and portion sizes were good. Complimentary soup (carrot and winter melon) and dessert (green bean, red bean dessert soup). We ordered the stewed bean curd beef brisket and tendon pot, pork belly braised with preserved vegetables and sweet & sour pork.  The brisket was a bit tough and could've used more time, the tendon was perfectly gelatinous. Flavors were good and the sauce went great with rice. The pork belly lacked sweetness and the belly meat could've used more time to tenderize as well. Finally the sweet and sour pork was good. Light, crispy batter and I appreciate that they used fresh pineapple. The pineapple can get sour if not cooked correctly and they had it still sweet and juicy which is great.   Overall, nothing that'll blow your socks off. But if you're looking for a family style Chinese dinner (great for groups), give this place a look if you're in Chinatown."}
{"text":"One of the less often spots for our family. This resturant is tucked away in a small strip mall down in China town. It's neighboured by a small barbershop and a store front that houses mahjong games.  Sitting down for dinner service you'll be nice and close to your neighbours, but this resturant has good quality quick stirfrys and other communal plates.  Make sure to check your take out orders correctness before leaving though! I've been given the wrong item several times, although delicious each time they were never what I ordered. It also takes a few tries to get through their phone as well, but they've got a good simple lunch menu to order from. All the congees and noodles I've had from their lunch menu have been great value for the portions they give you."}
