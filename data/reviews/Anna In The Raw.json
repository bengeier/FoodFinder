{"text":"Great juices, lunch menu, and Anna is so helpful!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was very disappointed in this place as I expected lots of raw vegan options and there was not many! In fact, I couldn't believe there were non-vegan items served at all! I first discovered Anna in the Raw at the Cleveland VegFest and expected this place to have some of the items presented at that event and that was not the case. Their juices we tried were not that impressive either. Restore and Diaita offer better cold pressed juices."}
{"text":"Best value for lunch! I work at Amtrust Group and what a find this is. Healthy affordable choices and sweet people to serve you!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   Super close to work and absolutely delicious! I had a curry tofu wrap that revived me after a weekend of indulgence. So green and good!   Everything I've had here is A+. Definitely check it out if you're looking for lunch downtown!"}
{"text":"Came to visit this place all the way from the fresh juice/raw capital - Los Angeles and Anna, I'm very impressed. Walking into Anna in the Raw I wasn't sure what to expect, until I met Anna herself. She was super helpful and sweet which was really pleasant :)  I tried the green goddess juice with a grilled chicken sandwich and the sweet potato salad. the green goddess juice was light and refreshing, it might be a tad sweet for my taste buds, but it felt very cleansing. Now the best part of the meal was this chicken sandwich. The chicken was juicy and tender (all white meat) and it was star of the dish! The chicken sandwich was fresh and my absolute favorite.   Anna, I can't wait to be back to try the rest of your fresh juices and sandwiches! Seriously, a hidden gem in Cleveland and your fresh face and upbeat personality is already worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Anna has been there to help each time I went in.  She took time to select and customize my selection.  I walked out with a week of juices and her direction  on best way to use them.  Blown away by the amount of fresh produce and the delicious combinations.   The sweet potato is amazing.  Also love the hercules-tons of greens."}
{"text":"Best cold-pressed juicer in town. Love the Apollo (beet) and Aphrodite. Watermelon mint is my favorite along with her specialty raw desserts and lunches. The chocolate cake is to die for as well as her Pumpkin Spice cake. All raw all the time! Also the Zeus (cold pressed coffee and cacao) is a great daytime booster. Her Macaroons and Kale chips I like as well plus everything is Organic!"}
{"text":"Anna is the real raw deal.  She takes so much pride in her work and treats everyone like family.  The juice is a lie changer and the healthy options are well thought out and well executed."}
{"text":"I came into Anna's shop for a quick bite as the first place I stopped in Cleveland. I was happy to see that a place so close to my hotel had a natural juice selection. When I walked in, Anna was incredibly nice and helpful with the menu and juice options. I tried the kale, ginger & grape juice and it was fantastic! A lot of the juice options sounded great so I'll definitely be going back there again! I also got the egg salad & bacon wrap, which was also very good. I would definitely recommend for a downtown Cleveland lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on my lunch break. Always happy to find a place for a healthy meal that caters to the vegetarian & vegan population. Service was quick and friendly. Ordered the kung pao tofu salad wrap, wasn't what I expected and I'm hoping that if I was tasting mayo it was veganaise... guess I'll find out soon (and my fault for not asking), but it was tasty."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for months and finally I found myself in the area to stop in. My experience could not have been better! The presence Anna has exemplifies a super food - super woman! Couldn't help but be brought to joy even before tasting the food. Service was great, asked what seemed to be some regulars for their recommendations and admittedly I was already hungry so I went for what my eyes fixated on first. The gluten free and vegan falafel - YUM! Will return again soon to try the juice. Keep rockin the health food world!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  Next I will try the soups, I've only had the sandwiches and wraps, and they were delicious.  Maybe some more advertising would be helpful, this place is very low-key and hard to find."}
{"text":"Anna knows her food!  She is inspiring in the way that she educates you on healthy eating and juicing.  She offers tremendous selections of cold-pressed veggie and fruit beverages, organic and vegan options to eat and can answer just about any question about the nutritional values and presence.  I may have to try her 1 or 3 day cleanse. My favorite is the APOLLO (beet, carrot, green apple and ginger juice!  One draw back is that this is in an office bldg lobby so only a couple seats.  So, take it back to work or home!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're doing some sort of vegan diet. I'm currently doing raw vegan and I went there for sort of like a brunch. And the lady there was super nice and had a lot of information. She had just made a fresh batch of raw vegan nacho kale chips that were the bomb. She even let my nine-year-old try them and my nine-year-old and I quote said this tastes just like real cheese. I had the raw vegan burger on a bed of lettuce sort of like a salad I also had raw vegan chocolate a nice Ginger green juice. Every single thing I have was great. I really wish I work downtown so that I could go there more because the hours are sort of like a lunch hour place"}
{"text":"Had tried out a post-lunch smoothie (Matcha talkin about Willis) from here: nice blend of stuff including mangos without any overpowering flavors. Service was quick and friendly Too! A little hidden away (only knew about this place from Yelp searching) but easy to get to once inside the main building.  Also has some food options decently priced which I may try if walking around Again!"}
{"text":"If you follow the Wahls protocol, Whole30 or just want a boost of nutrition this place is for you. Tucked inside the IMG lobby, this place is small but packs a punch. There are menus everywhere on the wall so look around or ask if there's something you want. After paying I saw several other things I wanted....lol. but those will be for another time. I was staying at the Westin and this is a block away. I had s berry and nut salad with chicken added. Chicken had a kick. Loved the biodegradable packaging.  I hope this place is open in the morning..."}
{"text":"Fantastic juices, creative blends Anna has made. I highly recommend trying this great store for a healthy drink, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Her Macaroons are sooo yummy! Too bad it's closed on the weekend. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to eat good healthy food!"}
{"text":"Some days, you just feel icky and want to eat healthy. Thanks Anna In The Raw for saving me from myself. I ordered the Aphrodite juice (pineapple, green apple, mint), the Smoked Turkey Breast sandwich, and my friend and I tried an Acai Bowl with fresh berries and goji berries on one of our particularly \"icky\" days.  I was a little bummed that the turkey sandwich didn't come on the described pretzel bun (I mean, how delicious does that sound?) but it was still tasty. All the ingredients were super fresh and the sandwich felt healthy and filling. The Aphrodite juice was one of the most satisfying juices I've ever had in CLE. Something about the sweetness of the pineapple with the tart of the green apple was heaven. I could have easily had one double the size. The Acai Bowl my friend and I split was colorful and had a slightly sweet taste to it, which was perfect (we were worried at first, some Acai Bowls have zero flavor) and were impressed with the selection of toppings to add.  Yes, this great place is a little expensive, but you are paying for quality. I would gladly order again from this female-owned business! I've seen on Anna's website that she also does juice cleanses, which has always interested me! Overall, had a great experience and can't wait to try again from their bigger menu."}
{"text":"Ehh, \"juice bars\" is a misleading category for this one. Anna offers tasty and healthy salads, wraps, and sandwiches in addition to fresh-pressed juices. This is in my lunch rotation because I can always find something delicious that makes me feel good for the rest of the day. You have to do a little exploring to find it, but you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"east ninth and saint clair hideaway of vegan food IMG building  So this little breakfast and lunch spot really rocks some good food.  Aside from the ubiquitous turkey, bacon, and veggie sandwiches and chips, the focus of the offerings are a lot of vegan, raw, and gluten free items. The juice blends are cold pressed fresh and extremely delicious. The soups are outstanding. And the killer is the vegan truffles. Raw cocoa powder, coconut, and other stuff just melt in your mouth. They are as good as can be. And not in the sense of \"they are sorta like real truffles\", they actually taste better than most \"real\" ones.  The entrance is tricky. You enter the IMG building from E.9th through the revolving doors and then walk straight down the hall past the elevators.  Give this place a shot.    Carry on..."}
{"text":"Anna was so sweet, the Aphrodite fresh juice was delicious and definitely worth buying one for the road! Thank you Anna for a fabulous experience at your spot! I'll be back!   Ps. The albacore tuna wrap was equally as delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Anna in the Raw's \"Good to Go\" cafe for lunch recently. Chef Anna herself was present and chatting with customers. This woman is so friendly!  I asked her what wraps were good and she suggested a chicken avocado wrap, which I quickly agreed with. She also suggested her home made sweet potato salad, which I also grabbed. She threw in a bag of her own macaroons and showed me her new monstrous juicer. She made a really good impression on me, so I was hoping the food would be good.  I took my vittles back to my cubicle a couple blocks away and chowed down. I loved the warm, fresh, tasty chicken in my wrap. There was a generous portion of avocado as well, which I absolutely loved. The sweet potato salad was delicious and now I want the recipe because I need it in my life. Finally, I tasted the cocoa macaroons and they were awesome. It was a perfectly sweet finish to my satisfying and healthy lunch.  I gave Anna a tip because I realized that she is the Chef and owner of this great local establishment. With tip, my lunch came to about $15, which is more than I normally would spend. But I know where to go to get a healthy, tasty chicken wrap when I'm in the mood.  Thanks, Anna!"}
{"text":"My number one favorite place to grab lunch downtown has got to be Anna in the Raw. With a bunch of vegetarian and vegan options, this is my go to for a quick healthy bite on my lunch break. Just today I grabbed an Asian Tofu Salad Wrap and some \"cheezy\" kale chips, which were of course fantastic.   Anna's juice collection is also fresh and fantastic. I've been in a few times when the juicer is up and running, so I know every drink is as fresh as possible. My favorite is the Eros, a seasonal watermelon mint juice, which is like a little sip of summer while I'm sitting at my desk.   If you're looking to add some color to your lunch break, this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time when I worked downtown in the building she is in. She has some really good food! Her breakfast sandwiches are always fresh and amazing and her turkey chili is like the best thing on earth!! I've never tasted turkey chili like that I wish I could get down there more often but I'm literally uptown and I am hardly ever downtown anymore she makes some really great food though, really great food! I've never been disappointed"}
