{"text":"Although I have been to Beryl's now a dozen or so times since I was introduced a few months ago, I finally have had a chance to write a review.    Having lived in Toronto for the last 10 years (and the last few just a few blocks from Albert's - one of the best Jerk places ever), I was really missing good, authentic Caribbean food.  Hence my utter joy when a fellow football coach told me this place was 'legit'.  He wasn't lying.   Much like a lot of the smaller Jerk spots downtown, Beryl's has fast, and really friendly service.   They offer pretty much what you would expect from a caribbean jerk restaurant - good curries, soup, fish, and of course, the Jerk.    I would say they are generally on par with many other restaurants when it comes to the coleslaw, rice and peas, even the curries.  But their excellence is in their jerk.   Their jerk chicken is one of the best I have had.   It's like having a Jamaican beach party, with the hottest boy/girl you ever met, in your mouth?   As a Torontonian now stuck in the Burbs, I really recommend checking these kids out.   Make sure to take it to go though - there are like 2 bar stools, and usually a bunch of people!"}
{"text":"Oxtail and jerk pork is good here, but the rice is always dry and I always have to pay extra for oxtail gravy. You have to finish your food immediately because leftovers don't taste good. Might I also add that I didn't get utensils with my meal. Service is sub par."}
{"text":"If you are in durham and looking for Mom & Pops Jamaican Food Take Out, his is the place for you. Beryl and her team is awesome providing friendly & fast service.  Food is made to order from the kitchen, not sitting under heat lamps. It's just too bad I have to travel to Ajax from Richmond hill to get my craving satisfied. Home cooking at it's finest  Recommendations: Jerk Pork on white rice with extra gravy"}
{"text":"Anytime I've ever set foot into a barrels Pepper Pot I'm always faced with rudeness and to top it off they have to charge you for every little thing, 1 dollar for gravy 1 dollar for hot sauce might as well charge for napkins and forks. They rope you in with specials and they are always done and the food doesn't taste fresh. It tastes like it was made the same day justb12 hours ago. Rather eat at shitty ass sunrise (who also suck)"}
{"text":"Great food with a nice home-cooked feeling.  I like that there's a different menu item on special every day.   I'm one of those people who tends to always order the same thing, but the rotating specials have gotten me to try some new stuff. Haven't been disappointed with anything, but the jerk chicken is still my #1.  Check out the website before you go to see which menu item is the special for that day. There's also one or two soups on offer each day.  For the Ajax location, try to avoid the peak lunch hour since it's a popular spot for people working in the area and the line can get pretty long."}
{"text":"Been working in Ajax for a year now. Been looking a for a good West Indian/Caribbean place- Beryl's Pepper Pot is it! Friendly Service, Great Food, Fast, & Fresh."}
{"text":"Overall the meats are well prepared and spiced.  Rice is consistently dry, I must always pay for the $1 gravy to even be able to finish the rice without choking.  This is food you have to eat when it is freshly made because once it gets cold and you have to re-heat it, oh boy, get your ketchup, soy sauce or whatever condiment you use out, and a glass of water, because that food will be as dry as my skin after a day at the beach.  Prices just keep going up and up, it's getting hard to even be able to afford a large oxtail anymore on a part-time salary.  The absolute worst part about this place is the service. Every single one of the workers there are rude. Every Single One. And they are really consistent with the rudeness too, it's every time.  On top of the rude service, you get extremely slow service in addition to standing in a room full of other hungry people, as the space in the Ajax location is horrible. I order my food, leave and come back 20 minutes later to pick it up just so I avoid the waiting room.  When you get your food to go as well, be sure to ask for a fork, it is not included with meals without request for some odd reason.  This would have been a 3/5 if it wasn't for the service, dry rice & costly gravy."}
{"text":"They never have boiled dumpling at like 1 pm if there popular make more... that's my biggest complaint more meat could be added to but the taste is good but not authentic... an they always run out of stuff early like make more food then it's not rocket science"}
{"text":"Seriously who takes a catering order and serves a tray of cold chicken that I paid $150 for and then says well you can bring it back and doesn't even apologize until I bring up the fact that the least they could do is apologize. Apparently they don't have an oven to keep food warm. Never have I ever ordered catering and was given cold food. No excuse, do not order catering from here. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"the shrimp roti is worth the wait. delicious; so is the jerk chicken, the beef / pumpkin ? soup, will be back !"}
{"text":"This place probably has the best jerk in Durham region.  Bought the jerk pork & chicken.  Might be a little spicy for some, but very tasty & fresh!  Peas n rice were also good!  Will definitely recommend & come again."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the jerk pork here and it was fantastic, just as other reviews that I've read. It's difficult to find jerk pork, but this place was excellent. The spicy gravy was also delicious!  As with most Caribbean restaurants, it wasn't cheap and the large jerk pork was about $10 and mostly rice and peas.  The only reason that I'm giving this review 4 stars is because the rice and peas weren't as good as I expected ... the rice almost seemed that it came pre-made package. I definitely try this place again, and hope that this was just a problem this one time. I'm looking forward the the one that's opening in downtown Oshawa!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Jamaican food spot of all time. I love their food , especially the jerk chicken , my second favorite would be the curry goat, my husband is a huge fan of the jerk chicken also. The only negative about this place is that the price keeps going up. Also I wish they served more meat when you order a large instead of more rice. Other than that I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my second review and I've been here a number of times since my first.   The food here is fantastic and the specials are great value for your money more than enough food.   The only negative about this place is that they have the same girl taking orders and dealing with people out front all the time. She lacks any customer service skills at all and her attitude is simply off putting. Today I got a large jerk chicken, it tasted great however when ordering she asked me which gravy, I was kind of caught off guard as my assumption would be that a jerk chicken would come with jerk gravy I said what are the options? She looked at me like I was an idiot for even asking ignored me hissed her teeth and rang up my meal.   I come back because I know how good the food is but the girl taking orders I'm sure has scared away customers people don't like to deal with someone like that.   Great food terrible service."}
{"text":"Just finished eating a large order of Jerk Chicken and Jerk Pork shared between the wife and I.  We were deeply disappointed with the flavours.  After reading the reviews on here we were stoked - being lovers of Jamaican food for years.  In the end, what we thought would be phenomenal was just 'whatever'.  This leads me to ask the question, what the hell were all these reviewers going on and on about?  Seriously, I have been to countless Jamaican/West-Indian joints for Jerk, Roti, Curry, etc, and this place DID NOT stand head and shoulders above all the rest.  In the pool of Caribbean restaurants, this joint AT BEST is 3/5.  For reasons on WHY, read on.  Why, contrary to other reviewers, I found this place to be an average 3/5 stars: 1)  They charge you almost a full dollar for gravy on your meal - 0.95 cents to be exact.  This is just unheard of.  I've been to Ritz's on Yonge, Cravin's, Mr. Jerk, Tastees, Caribbean Wave, and countless other restaurants along Eglinton Ave West (btwn oakwood and Allen) and I have never been charged for asking for gravy on my order.  To add insult to injury, the amount of gravy given was ridiculous and the rice and peas still tasted dry - now I know why one reviewer recommended the gravy.  THIS IS A HUGE MINUS 1 star.  2)  The food can be evaluated in components: a) Jerk Chicken - they serve more of a dry jerk chicken;  the flavour is on the outer skin of the meat and the marinade didn't really penetrate the meat on the inside; the flavour was subtle and you have to almost think about it in the after-taste to actually process the taste.  Better at so many other joints than this place. b) Jerk Pork - not bad...a bit on the dry side...nothing spectacular or praise worthy - in fact, if they couldn't do at least this much, I'd have deducted another star.  c) Coleslaw - again, disappointing.  Lacked a cohesive flavour.  Good coleslaw allows the cabbage to soak up the other ingredients and become one in flavour...the coleslaw here tasted like the cabbage and the mayo had a fight and were trying to make the best of a relationship headed for disaster.  I tasted grated cabbage that was wearing mayo;  it wasn't 'coleslaw'. d) Rice and peas - good in terms of texture and firmness/softness, but again, it's freaking rice and peas man...if you can't make this to at least this level, you are not doing it right.    Overall, I think the people who buy from this place and put up these HIGH reviews are either: 1) ignorant of what really great west-indian/jamaican food is supposed to taste like or 2) they are related to the ownership/management of the restaurant. ;-)  Recommendation:  Go if there is nowhere else for you to go.  But, I will not say this place is heavely, devine or magnificant.  Why?  Because it's not.  I won't follow the rest when the rest obviously don't know what they are talking about.  Personally, this place is easily forgotten and makes me think the reviewers of ajax west indian food really need to travel into the GTA core to sample what is probably a closer representation of the true flavours of west indies.  Peace."}
{"text":"Was in town to headed to Beryl's for their Thursday special - I had just missed it so got the Roti and Jerk Chicken.  - Loved the jerk chicken (again you need to buy the sauce on the side as it adds a nice kick to the rice and peas on the side).   - Coleslaw is disappointing though (so if your dish doesn't already come with it - then skip the slaw - not worth paying extra for) - Rice and peas are excellent and with an extra dose of their jerk sauce (extra cost) its even better - Roti - was disappointing (too much potato and the roti shell was subpar)  skip the roti - skip the slaw apart from that the Jerk Chicken itself was a big hit and with the rice and peas the extra sauce is a must."}
{"text":"I visit baryls once in a while. The food is okay. The food is better in the morning as opposed to the night time.  What disappoints me most about this place is that the curry chicken (The only thing I really like) is only sold on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Wow, what an awesome little joint Beryl's pepperpot is!  We stopped by based on Yelp recommendations for some goat curry with a side of dumpling and fried chicken lunch.  The goat pieces were fall off the bone tender and the curry, a perfect balance of spices without being too salty.  Hubby's friend chicken pieces were also excellent with a side of crunchy coleslaw.  All at a very reasonable $20ish bill, this place is a real gem!  I'll be back to try out their other goodies soon."}
{"text":"This is the best jamaican food in durham.  West Indian/ jamaican food is my favorite... the oxtail is amazing. . I usually get it with provisions. .. which means you get a boiled dumplin.  Cooked banana.  Yam and your oxtail or what ever meat it is that you want. it's pricey. And the wait is aometimes Long and you get a little attitude at the counter .. but I just want this food... it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Outstanding Jerk chicken! The best I've had in Canada."}
{"text":"This is for their delivery service.  There was a problem with my order. It had been packed with another order, which was going to a different location. Guess what? I had to go to that different location to get my order. Then I discovered my order was incomplete.  The truck driver yelled at me. He became irate and aggressive when I mentioned that my order was separate and it should not have been packed with the other location's order. He took no responsibility, saying this how it was given to him. Then when I had to contact him again to explain my order was incomplete, he still yelled at me and had the audacity to insinuate I was lying.  This is not correct customer service. YOU DO NOT YELL AT THE CUSTOMER. See how uncomfortable it is to read something in all caps?  It can very well be authentic Jamaican jerk, but no need to be a jerk who is Jamaican with a loud and aggressive attitude. Specially to a small woman. Shameful.  It's not worth it - not worth receiving 2 measly pieces of bone with a little bit of meat and dried rice from the day before."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Firstly the location, it was tucked away in a light industrial/business plaza. I actually drove past it, not expecting a restaurant to be there. There's no seating that I noticed, it's mainly for take out and catering.   This wasn't a problem for me, I actually wanted take out. But beware, there is no dinning section.  I tried the curry goat, beans and rice, and coleslaw. The curry goat was decent and satisfied my craving. The beans and rice, it's beans and rice. Not much to it.   The coleslaw is a sweet coleslaw. Which went well with the everything. Didn't over power the other parts, and was fresh.   The person that took my order was very polite and to the point. They are friendly to their regulars.   Bottom line, I'm going to go back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Today the food was great. Flavors were on point and quality was there. Glad to see the last time we went was not the new norm."}
