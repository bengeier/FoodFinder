{"text":"Just ordered take out for the first time. AMAZING!!  Ordered a bake panzerotti with mushrooms and green peppers.  The portion was very generous.  Angnolotti pasta with white clam suave was so flavorful  We will order from here again!"}
{"text":"Had amazing food from this restaurant. I had the agnolotti carbonara, which had exquisite flavour. The service was prompt (we had it delivered) and friendly. After having some disappointing Italian food in the past, I was wary about ordering the pasta, but I was wrong to doubt this amazing experience. The wings were piping hot and extremely flavourful, and plentiful as well. Would definitely recommend and order again during our next visit to Vaughan."}
{"text":"This place has the best penne ala vodka. The portions are big and you get a big bun with it.  I wish they had servers, because I don't like to line up to order my food.  Washrooms needs a make over."}
{"text":"I love this place! Used to work in the Woodbridge area and I was a regular for lunch. The Penna a la vodka is amazing, and the Greek salad is a favourite too.   My coworkers still frequently visit, and the employees recommended a similar restaurant for me in my new neighbourhood. Seriously!  The service is fast, the prices are very reasonable and there is always a table as people are constantly flowing through.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Edible food. Do not prefer my rice balls to be soaked in sauce, would rather have the sauce on the side. The Mediterranean wrap was not good at all. Customer service needs some work. I would not return."}
{"text":"Must try the panzerotti baked or fried with sauce on the side for dipping. Everyone says to get the fried but if you don't have the calories to spare the baked is just as good IMO.  You get to pick toppings to put in (50cents each) but try not to add too many as the panzerotti is HUGE and oozing with cheese. Also tried the veal sandwich that was okay (i'm not a huge veal fan). Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good spaghetti, overpriced meat balls. Really good lasagna, pizza is not bad... Very good overall except..  I tried there chicken wings, def tasted pretty bad but decent quantity. Did not like how it tasted at all very salty and cheap tasting.   I wish some of there items were more affordable for example try ordering spaghetti with ^extra meat balls will run u over 20 dollars"}
{"text":"The terrible cashiers messed up my order for the second time in a row visiting. My other two family members got their meal, but myself and my mother's orders did not come until much longer after."}
{"text":"Panzerottis are delicious, like giant pizza pops. Staff is super friendly. Expect to wait a bit, because this place is very popular."}
{"text":"Had it a few times now since I work really close to it. Thought it was gonna be real authentic Italian pizza but in my opinion it's good but not all that. Really thought it was gonna be better then it was seeing it's always packed but it's just another pizza store but still definitely better then other pizza stores out there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the family. Spacious seating area with a retro/modern vibe - wood tables with red metal chairs and red subway tile on walls. Liked the wall sized picture, of what I'm guessing is the Ricci family enjoying a meal with family and friends from days gone by. Nice touch. There was no lineup when we went, so our orders were taken quickly at the front counter. We were given a buzzer and told to take a table, until our orders were ready(about 5-10 minutes). Kids enjoyed watching soccer on the large screen tv's mounted throughout the place, so time went by quickly. Buzzer went off, we waved it in the air from our table, and food was delivered piping hot to us. Veal sandwiches were a good size with tender veal in a light tasting tomato sauce, with cheese. Same for breaded chicken sandwich with mayo, lettuce and tomato. Chicken was pounded thin and was crispy. Wished bun would have been a bit smaller, as bread to meat ratio was a bit off. The chicken Mediterranean wrap was delicious and very generous in size, but had too much balsamic dressing that made a big puddle on the plate and made the tortilla shell kind of mushy- would order it again but would request they go light on the dressing. Overall, a great place to catch a bite in-house, or to enjoy as take-out, or have delivered to your door."}
{"text":"OMG best panzo in Toronto..... Other stuff is decent pizza is really good but if you don't come too often you can't get anything else......you must get the ponzo fried not baked.....you can put anything you want in it.....The crust is too good...crunchy and golden it is insane....Also the thing is bigger than your head....tomato sauce on the side for dipping....oh man too good."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST Panzerottis ever, Pasta dishes are all amazing as well, make sure you try the greek salad it is just incredible! The side meat sauce taste great always fresh.  Great taste, fresh ingredients, Huge portions, you cant beat it! in a city full of wompy restaurants and pizza/panzo places Ricci's saves the day!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and panzerotti are AWESOME.  Even the various pasta options are very satisfying.  Be prepared to be thirsty for a ton of water after as the dishes don't taste salty, but apparently carry a lot of it.  Not that it deters me from ordering from here every once in a while."}
{"text":"What can I say about Ricci's, I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all really good. Get a fried panzo with meat sauce and you'll be in heaven. The slices are addictive, I ran across the road when I was at work to grab a slice and right when I finished I ran back and grabbed another slice."}
{"text":"Picked up a party size pepperoni. The crust is chewy and sweet. The sauce is sweet and pepperoni is not too spicy. A very pleasing, tasty pizza. Best place for a pizza."}
{"text":"I recently started to order food here and in the 4 times I've been there I haven't been disappointed, very well managed and organized.  Food is great and we'll priced, definitely to be added to the list of take out restaurants in the rotation"}
{"text":"I had the Gnocchi with Alfredo sauce. It was ok but the gnocchi did not taste homemade. The veal sandwich was soggy. I really don't know why the reviews were so good!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, not the best pizza I've tasted (at this rate, I wished I ordered from Pizza Nova, they are consistent on taste and quality) I use to come to Ricci's a lot a while back and back then it was really good, today however, hardly enough sauce and toppings ( bacon mushrooms and pepperoni ) had no flavour to it, won't order pizza there again."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat. It's really informal, there are a few tables, but there's not a lot of room, not really a 'sit down' place.   The panzerotto is really good, and huge. Get it fried. Their pastas are also decent, and the sandwiches aren't bad either. But go there for the panzo. I think that they also deliver, and their pizza is not bad either.   It seems like most people just pick up their food, and the place is set up to make that easy, but it's still a good place to go with a friend to get lunch. I recommend."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten here once and I have to say the pizza isn't too bad. The sauce has a different taste than any other pizza you can get at Pizza Hut or Pizza Pizza. Although the pizza wasn't THAT amazing, my friend got the pepperoni panzerotti and I thought that tasted better than the actual pizza, it had way more cheese and sauce.   The sauce is quite nice actually, it taste different and I like that. But again the pizza was subpar, I wanted to love it but it just didn't reach the awesomeness level for me.   The environment was really laid back and welcoming, we were quick to be served and the menu is super simplistic and easy to read. I wish Ricci's wasn't so far! But if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"They have improved a lot! Currently my favorite place for pastas. I get the spaghetti and add mushrooms and garlic. I like it a lot :)"}
{"text":"Top shelf Italian dishes. The only problem is how packed it is in the evening. The food is amazing and it never takes long after you order."}
{"text":"I think something's happened to me because after having Ricci's a few weeks ago for the first time, I woke up last week realizing I wouldn't get through the day if I didn't go back. I think it had something to do with the panzerotto. Anyway, I managed to round up a couple of friends and we drove through a storm (no storm present south of Steeles, not that it would've stopped me) so that I could get my fix.   When I arrived, I really had no clue what it was I wanted. I actually wanted to try a bit of everything but thinking back to a baked panzo I once had at Abruzzo's that was pretty good, I thought I'd opt for it at Ricci's. No one wanted to split the fried one and the thought of having one all to myself made me feel kind of dirty. Call me a prude but I just couldn't go through with it. Not that night, anyway...  I have to say that the fried panzo is A LOT better than the baked version. Let's not kid ourselves, if something edible is normally half-decent, think of what wonders frying can do for it! And that's the difference between Ricci's fried and baked panzerotti. The crust was kind of hard on the baked, and the fillings were sparse that night. The end, never again. It'll be fried all the way from now on. Almost all the tables ordered the fried and it made me sad seeing them pass me by. It's the feeling one gets when you buy an ice cream cone and the only scoop goes rolling off with the first lick. Pretty emotional for a panzerotto, I know.  My friend got the lasagna (he said it tasted like Chef Boy-R-Dee, but that's his way of making me feel better when I order something that isn't as good as I'd hoped--so sweet he is! The other friend got a couple slices of pizze which didn't look like anything too special. I think they look way better (and probably taste better) when ordered full and fresh out of the oven, which is the plan for my next visit."}
{"text":"Food is really well done. We usually order out because it's way better then post pizza places around. Food is also a nice portion size"}
{"text":"Had the basic cheese and tomato sauce pizza with some basil on thin crust. It was the best pizza I have had in a while!  My only complaint is that I had the pizza delivered and it was slightly cold when I got it."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  The people were friendly. The rice balls were very good.  The pizza was fantastic!!  I was full, but couldn't stop eating... it was that good.  I also had a bottle of Brio (chinotto soda); it was tasty and added to the experience as a whole (It is a traditional Italian soft drink that looks like a cola and is made with bitter oranges, but it tasted like a smooth \"toned-down\" cola)."}
{"text":"They are really good !their panzo is the best !!!!  I usually eat a lot and I can't finish it  Tomato sauce is in the best"}
{"text":"Doesnt even deserve a star. The guy on the phone was absolutely disrespectfull and unproffessional. He wouldnt want to deliver inside the mall when he charges us for delivery and driver request a tip when they dont even deserve one. There is no words to express how disgusted i am from the idiot on the phone. If he was in front of i would probably spit in his face."}
{"text":"My Italian Friend said lets go have lunch and he had me at fried Calzone. WOW the portion size are good and awesomely right. you can choose what you want in your Calzone. They have a buzzer system but they bring the food to your table once you order it at the cashier.   The Calzone was amazing! it was full of the topping I choose. Once I had a bite...there was no looking back after that.   Overall, very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich is life changing Veal parm is huge and delish Chicken parm was so so  Even the baked panzo is amazing, its all in that sauce This is serious Italian take out!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Their panzo's and pizza are delicious!!! I've had their panzos fried and baked and I think I prefer baked, but the fried was great too. If you're not feeling up for pizza or a panzo their pasta is just as good, and definitely won't disappoint.  This is a really casual place that does dine-in with no table service, take-out and delivery if you live up in Woodbridge. Quality is consistent dining in or taking out. This is one of those place I will go out of the way for just because it always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Visited Ricci's a few weeks ago before heading to see a movie. Atmosphere was welcoming, staff was friendly. Was given a buzzer to alert me when food was ready. I assumed I'd have to go up and grab it ( Even though I was staying in to eat) but no - server brought it over with a smile.  Deep fried Panzo was huge and delicious.. the RICE BALL.. I'm still thinking about it. Awesome.  I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I wonder, am I allowed to swear openly in a review? Screw it, I'm going for it!!  HOLLYYYYYY SHIT BALLLSSSS!!!! UN-F#$%^g real! (I couldn't bring myself to F-bombing).  OK. Here we go, here is the skinny, the moment you've all been waiting for...   I think I have a new favourite panzerotto (Calzone).... Ya... take a moment and let THAT sink in. This is some serious SHIT!   I feel like a cheating whore. A dirty panzo eating whore, who has cheated on his one true panzo love, the beautiful succulent Abruzzo Panzerotto. For years, she has been good to me. CFL football in size, sexy curves, saucy, full of wonderfulness and always knew just what to do to make me feel good. She is my old reliable. My one true love. My...reason for never being able to achieve 6 pack abs!!!  But then, my Bro-tastic manly friend Sami E, brought me to Ricci's, brought me there like so many unassuming men before me. He promised we were just gonna stop in for a quick bite, it wouldn't mean anything. Nothing... he promised.   I walked up to the counter like I was about to make a drug deal..more like a deal with the devil. I looked around sheepishly and ordered a deep fried panzo (thinking that since I was a baked panzo kinda guy that this would turn me off and I would go back to my beloved). Well let me tell you folks, you can put Angelina Jolie in a burlap sack, but when you take that burlap sack off...it's still friggin Angelina underneath!! (but now neked... tee hee).  I waited with bated breath at my table for my deep fried mistress to arrive, feet tapping, mouth watering, jumping everytime a kitchen member would walk out with someones order, ready to yell out \"mee, mee over here.\" But time and again I was waiting....  ...While I wait, let me recount what I added to the pile of guilt inside my panzo: Basic Cheese and sauce, italian sausage, green peppers, hot peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, and goat cheese.......... ughhhh seriously!!  Finally my name was called and as I ran towards the server haphazardly knocking over 2 senior citizens, a small hemophiliac baby, a priceless faberge egg and a 3 hour domino set up**, I drooled hungrily and snapped and snarled at any one who gave me a wary glance!!  Sami, had a sly grin on his face as I raised my fork and knife in the air, brandishing them, ready to attack - he knew some serious gluttony was about to go down. You handsome magnificent bastard, you knew it... YOU KNEW IT!!!!!  Diving in face first, the first bite hit me like a watermelon to the face***, then the second, then the third... ... ... ... until I woke up. My clothes were torn and hanging off of me, sauce lay everywhere, babies were crying, a gentleman behind us began to choke on his food, and people stood staring at me, mouths open in shock!  OH NO... it happened again. Panzo Hulk had emerged, and I was a horrible person once again, I had cheated and loved every delicious moment of it. BAWSE SAWSE....just honestly I would free-base this sauce and inject it directly into my jugular if I wasn't so afraid of needles.  You think I'm done? He-He-he-heeeellllllllllssss NO! Didn't I tell you that my seductress brought a sexy friend with her? Ya that's right, I had a good old fashioned Italian 3-some! With balls!!! Rice balls that is! Ricci's not only runs the show with the panzo's but they do a mighty fine rice ball (aranccini) as well (equally coated in their BAWSE SAWSE).   Fast forward to today, it's been almost 2 weeks. I'm too ashamed to go home and face the music. To admit love for another after so many years... how *sniff* HOW DO YOU DO THAT!!! ---------------------------------------------------------- - This review was a work of minor fiction, only the place, people and food were real, everything else was created and written for the purpose of your enjoyment. As a summary I would recommend you give this place a try.  **http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDZjzhXTfBs ***http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyLUCnTdu7o  EATCREST.... WAY WAYYYYY OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent first experience. My wife and I had wanted to try this place prior to their recent renovation but never had the time. Now the prices have gone up a tad but the food is pretty good, just not overly fantastic as what some people say.   Had the pizza and veal sandwich, pizza was medium to high quality, pretty good but I've had better in Woodbridge. veal sandwich tasted like a franchise sandwich. Again, not bad but it didn't jump out as special. I think the small shop charm is missing.   I will try more of their menu before making a concrete assessment."}
{"text":"Place used to be my go to for pizza (I rated a 5* previously) but since they renovated about a year and a half ago I've noticed the service really take a nose dive.  The food is still as good as it was pre-reno (when the service is adequate).  For delivery I had stone cold pizza delivered to my door twice on back to back orders.  One of the orders took over an hour to arrive.  When I told someone about it there was absolutely nothing done other than just saying sorry.    A few weeks later I stopped in on my way home to pick up some sauce for my own use at home.  I waited 25 minutes after paying for them to ladle some sauce in a cup for me.  When I kept asking the person at the counter seem shocked that I hadn't been served yet.    After 3 poor service issues with only a \"sorry\" from the staff I have decided that I won't be eating here anymore.   I would rather (and do now) order from big chain pizza places for delivery instead as I know my order will arrive hot and in a reasonable amount of time.   If you want to eat at the restaurant I suggest going to the place around the corner that I found because of the Ricci's issues.  It's called Ciao Roma.  The pizza is actually better than Ricci's but they only will deliver on orders over $50. https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ciao-roma-pizza-vaughan"}
{"text":"Great and fresh Italian classics. Although beware on weekends they are super busy so order ahead"}
{"text":"The only thing I ever order here are their pizza pockets and it is absolutely delicious. I always come back time and time again."}
{"text":"2.5 stars if they had it .... ordered a large pizza and it was okay. Nothing special about it. Over priced in my opinions - paid $35. Didn't get any dipping sauce or any crushed peppers / parmesan cheese"}
{"text":"Good food been going here for years, however the prices have skyrocketed over the last couple of years. Good for lunch call ahead as they are always jammed."}
{"text":"It is the kind of place where you place your order up front, then choose a table and they bring your food out.   I had a Panzerotti, which is like a Calzone, without the Ricotta cheese (just mozzarella). It was okay, but too chewy... and I tried the riceballs (Not a fan). Next time I'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"Got there at 10pm only to find out they close at 10:30 instead of what's advertised for 11pm, anyhow most stuff is out of order except sandwich. So we got veal sandwiches and two rice balls.  The veal sandwiches are no comparison to the st. Lawrence market one in downtown. It is over oily, but overall ok. Rice ball is nothing special, hard rice and some filling in tomato sauce.  We sat down at 10:15, figured we will still have 15 mins to eat, the food came pretty quickly. But at 10:25, we heard the staff commenting on why we are not done yet and we should take it to go since it is just sandwich.. Very rude service.  Overall very bad experience, never coming back again."}
{"text":"I've covered over 1/4 of the items on Ricci's menu and haven't come across something that didn't impress me yet. I only take out and they're very quick at it. Never waited more then 10mins for my order.  The place is very clean and professional and they have an open kitchen which I like, (shows they have nothing to hide).   Amazing Veal Sandwich, my work ordered a few partysize pizza's with 100 wings, all very good. Salads were all good.  (nice bean salad by the way).  I recently tried one of their cold cut prosciutto sandwiches and it was great!"}
{"text":"Yes it is delicious.  Yes it is understated.  Yes they are open late.  Yes they have very fast and friendly service.  I had the veggie sandwich and rice ball.  The sandwich was tasty and the rice ball was perfect, gooey and saucy but still held together with enough risotto.  They also are no frills on a plaza.  Next time I will have the panzerotto...but I may have to run there before I indulge in it!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place three chances since it has good reviews but just not feeling it. First time i ordered a 5 topping pizza and it came not hot just warm and the toppings pretty much raw. It had a basic flavour and really light on sauce.. but thought maybe it had too many toppings for them/the cooks to handle? I also got a weird look from the server upon ordering it as if that wasn't a good idea or something, so thought I'd give it a second chance.. Second visit i ordered a panzerotti and the pepperoni was completely raw but since it had so much cheese it masked the raw flavor of the pepperoni.  The sauce again was bland and felt like it should have had more.  The one good item was the Caesar salad with chicken, however I find it hard to really mess up a Caesar salad..  Third visit i ordered a pizza for a second try but this time with only two toppings and extra sauce (thought I'd learned from the last time).  Once again, pizza came not hot just warm and ready to eat right away.  Once again, the two toppings came mostly raw. The cheese melted very well and the crust a little toasty - so almost burnt base, well done center, and raw top/toppings is how they like their pizza? The sauce once again was bland and not much on it even though i asked for extra.  Maybe they're ovens just cook inconsistently? I don't know.. the so-called \"pepperoni\" also tasted like mortadella and it was disgusting.  Haven't been to other locations but Woodbridge is just bad.  It's not very clean, bathrooms were dirty - in fact i found someone else's food spit into a napkin when i went inside, go figure! The napkin holders on the tables were filthy, and there's fruit flies once in a while coming at you & your food.  The servers also seemed irritable and very hurried with every customer, in a just get the job done kind of way. The only nice thing i guess was the updated look inside.  I wanted to like the food from this place but i just can't recommend it after giving it multiple opportunities."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here once. We got pasta. I thought the service was terrible. The lady behind the counter didn't acknowledge us until a few minutes later. When they brought the food to our table, one lady literally slid the plate of pasta to my husband and I and said \"here you go\" and walked away so abruptly. I was shocked!! \"Here you go\" are you kidding me?  The food... isn't the best.. I've had better."}
{"text":"Starting right off the bat the pizza here have the most crispy crust I have ever had! We ordered the supreme slice and it was amazing... thick crust, lots of toppings and the crust was so crispy and good... definitely can't go wrong with their pizza!  This is my first time trying a fried panzerotto and holy shhhh, it was amazing!! It was huge, doughy and was loaded with cheese. We made a mistake of not adding additional toppings ($0.50) and just had it with cheese but nevertheless the simplicity of it was still very yummy. Next time I'll add some meat in to it and get sauce on the side.   We also ordered the lasagna to give their pasta a try. The lasagna was good (comes with a side of bread), but it was nothing special. I wouldn't get it again because the panzerotto and pizza are amazing here. Maybe I'll give their pasta another try...  You order in line in front then seat yourself and wait until they bring your food to you. Food doesn't take long to come - prompt service. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is our must go to whenever we are in the vaughan area! They refine the concept of panzos and once you've had their panzo you can never justify having it anywhere else!  We always customize our panzo with cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms and ask for it to be deep fried! Sooo delicious. It is a huge panzo so definitely can share with another person. Also add the meat tomato sauce with it to dip (so worth it!!) It does take about 10-15 minutes to make but it is worth it. We've also tried their ravioli and is also super tasty. Has a very homey taste to it as well!  If you dine in, the wait staff will deliver the food directly to you.Always had impeccable service and never a complaint. Can't wait to return for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best panzerotti... ever. period. Huge portions. Load it up with you fav toppings & dipping sauce (both extra $). Worth the calories. Pizzas, salads, and pastas are also great. You can't go wrong. Service is efficient.. manages the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Their fried panzerotti is out of this world. The tomato sauce for dipping is amazing too. So worth the trip and the calories."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. My gf and I walked in not knowing to sit then order or order then sit. So we waited for our friends to come and we ordered (then sit). The lady at the register was very patient when we were figuring out our order. She was friendly, not to mention helpful. Told us exactly how much each cost and what cost extra (toppings, etc).   Our food arrived really quick. Had a pizza and lasagna.. And it was one of the best pizza I have had in a while. I actually can't recall another pizza joint this good. The lasagna was fantastic too! Came very hot and we actually had to wait for it to cool down before digging in. The pasta had a very slight hint on coconut in it, or was there?! I couldn't even tell.. It was so darn good!  Friends had the panzerotti and another pizza. Their pizza was fresh, just like mine and came out steaming.. The panzerotti was smokin' hot, dark golden colour.. Perfect crunch and sauce. They ordered a small panzo and it was pretty darn big!  4 stars for food and last one for excellent service!"}
{"text":"I had a medium veal sandwich that tasted decent. Nothing special that's for sure. Had much better sandwiches at California or Via Panini.   I was quite disappointed with the pizza. Pizza wasn't cooked properly and tasted too doughy, way too much cheese and bland sauce. Never understood the hype over this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian take out joints.  Long menu that offers many combinations.  They move quick here, but be prepared to wait during busy times.  I recommend the deep fried panzerotti with side of meat sauce."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a place that beats RICCIs!!!They have the best pizza, Panzerrottis, sandwiches and PASTA!!!The sauce isn't some canned ragu....or \"ketchup\"sauce..it's the REAL DEAL...like Nona makes.You have to be patient and wait for your order..but it's definitely worth it.I always go there and I,m never dissapointed.C'mon...a homemade-style plate of pasta for 6$!!!! Where else can u get that?!RICCIS do us a favor...OPEN ON SUNDAYS!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place ever, my family took me here once and I pretty much go every week now! The food is amazing, it comes out pretty quick even though it looks super busy. The staff members are young but totally chill, respectfully and fast at getting things done. The chicken sandwich is to die for, I could eat it all day, everyday. A must go to place!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1994 when I moved to Woodbridge the pasta and panzerottis are great. The service here needs serious overhaul. They have a system where they call out your name when your food is ready so if there is more than one person named Mike which happened to me the last time I was in there there was four they're looking for orders I made a suggestion one time that they should be using numbers it would be a lot easier if they used numbers than the people who have that specific number will come up instead of for 5 people coming up or the staff calling out someone's name six or seven times before somebody answers it's annoying to people eating in the dining room but yet they still have this ridiculous system of using names so all their wait stuff is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. If their pasta and ponzo's weren't good I would definitely not come back to this place."}
{"text":"Really nice to see great independently owned establishments close to home that have a lot to offer. Let's get the cons out of the way because there are so many pros. The cons are that sometimes the service can be off-putting. The girl who took my order at the counter this time was particularly standoffish which was a bit disappointing, but I didn't let it get in the way of my dinner, you won't get award-winning service from here in my experience (but it wouldn't kill them to try).. The pros are that the food here is REALLY yummy, and super affordable!! I ordered a pizza with custom toppings and it was made fresh to order, and only about $15! We tried a variety of pastas and salads, and really enjoyed everything. Keep in mind this place doesn't have table service, you order first at the counter, pay, and the meals are brought out to the seating area by name. Overall I can say that all of our food tasted phenomenal and it was so crazy affordable. I recommend this place if you just want to grab a delicious bite to eat for an affordable price, and are not too concerned about the level of service."}
{"text":"I LOVE RICCI'S!!!   I've been going to this place since I was a kid and it never disappoints. The reason I keep coming back here is the panzerotti, this is a large dough pocket filled with cheese and your choice of toppings, you have the option to get it baked or fried, you MUST get it fried and with a side of tomato sauce. The dough comes out of the fryer perfectly crispy on the outside and beautifully fluffy on the inside. The toppings are standard pizza toppings but the sauce is the real hit. The sauce on the side is worth the extra charge, it is a simple tomato sauce that is clearly made fresh, they don't add too much to the sauce but they let the amazing tomatoes shine (this sauce is something i would imagine a true Italian nonna making).   Another of my favourites here is the rice balls. These are balls of orzo rice, stuffed with mozeralla and peas, breaded then fried, they are served with that amazing tomato sauce. The rice balls are cheesy, saucy, soft, but a little crispy, they are served hot and are simply to die for. The pizza here is also good and I have heard good things about their pasta and veal (they must make a mean veal sandwich since their phone number is 850-VEAL).   This is a very laid back place, you come in order at the counter, take a seat and wait for your name to be called. It gets busy but the food usually comes out promptly. I believe they do have a liquor license but you should pass up the alcohol and opt for a brio. The portions are very generous (the panzerotti's are massive, but i always manage to finish it) and the price is very reasonable. This place is a woodbridge legend if you are in the area be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"For all of you that live in the Woodbridge area, hang out there or even just drive through you should all be well aware of this iconic restaurant Riccis.  For those of you that have not heard of it or have heard of it and haven't gotten around to trying it then you better set your self straight and try Ricci's ASAP.  This is no regular pizzeria where you get your pizza and wings.  Ricci's is a full blown restaurant with the pizzeria vibe.  Don't worry about dressing up to go to Ricci's as its a very casual place.  Quality restaurant food but with the pizzeria casual feel.  The menu choices are incredible and im sure there is something on the menu for you.  Every thing from pizza and wings all the way to fancy pasta dishes and gourmet salad.  The choices are endless.    Over the years I have been to Ricci's probably 100 times lol.  Just realized that I had not reviewed it yet.  I was there a few days ago so I decided to take pics of our food and get on to giving it a review.  I ordered a prosciutto and asiago sandwich.  The sandwich was huge great portion of meat where most places lack the portion of meat in sandwiches.  My wife ordered a ponzo and we also had a rice ball.  5 star plus to my last visit like i expected.  Just a word of advise Ricci's can get very busy at times so be patient its well worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's been months since I've visited Ricci's. I felt like an updated review was needed.   I just finished a medium pepporoni pizza and it was delightfully delicious. The mozzarella cheese they use is full flavor and not the cheap stuff you get at Costco. Regarding pizza connoisseurs,  the dough is on the breadier side, and not very amusing.   Overall,  a combination of fresh ingredients and a fluffy crust makes Ricci's a must try on your list."}
{"text":"Disappointing. With good reviews and coming recommended from a friend, I had high expectations for Ricci's even though I am always cautious about Italian food (I love Italian food but bad Italian food is very very common.)   I ordered the gnocchi and upgraded the sauce to their pescatore (seafood) sauce for $3 extra. I knew this price meant the \"shrimp, calamari, and clams\" offered wouldn't be plentiful but I did not expect to find precisely one mini shrimp in my dish. The calamari also seemed to be of suspect quality.   The tomato sauce itself was just not good. It wasn't terrible but I'd expect better from an Italian joint in Woodbridge. It seemed Canadianized.   Also, once I ordered it took over 15 minutes for my dish to arrive. This would be acceptable in a restaurant but with the set up they had, I expected a quicker lunch. In fact, I had to pack most of my dish to go because I had to get back to work.   The decor was nice and as I saw panzerottis pass by I thought to myself that I definitely ordered the wrong thing. Part of me wants to give them another chance to try the panzo but another part says there's tons of Italian joints in Woodbridge so why go back to one that's disappointed you before?"}
{"text":"For some strange reason it seems I overlooked reviewing the local favourite in Ricci's  Everyone in Woodbridge knows about Ricci's quality   The best way to describe it as a pizzeria is to compare it to gourmet burgers vs fast food/chain burgers   This is essentially gourmet pizza right here  If you don't mind paying a slight premium for increased quality then Ricci's will be the choice every time   They do pizza good and train their employees properly which goes a long long way as far as consistency is concerned and after ordering from them for ten plus years I can confidently say quality and consistency are their calling cards  I prefer the pizzas but their sandwiches and pastas are worth trying as well."}
{"text":"The best panzo's in the area. The pizza is just as good too, but get a baked panzo is Their best feature.   I usually get a panzo and rice ball ($5 for 1 but worth it)  Pepperoni slices are 10/10 for only $4 a slice they are Massive.   It's a bit more money than average pizza places but this is well above average.  Their veal sandwiches are okay. Just average.. like California sandwich or parmigiana near the Burger King down the road. So I wouldn't go there just for a sandwich."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. They could not provide me with my order and did not want deliver what they did have because it wasn't enough money for them.   I spoke to the owner mike and have never experienced such rudeness before."}
{"text":"I was told that Ricci's is located in a very \"Italian\" section of the Toronto suburbs.  After dining there last week, this makes complete sense.  This place screams authentic Italian to me!  I had the Veal Sandwich and an order of rice balls.  The veal sandwich was awesome--HUGE, lightly breaded and on GREAT homemade (I think) bread.  I ordered it with everything, however, I would NOT recommend this, as I feel this sandwich would be better served in a minimalist way--maybe some cheese and some red sauce.  Plus, the extra toppings made the sandwich slide off the bun way too easily.  The rice balls were REALLY good, served in a pool of their delicious homemade tomato sauce.  Although they are a bit pricey for what you get ($4.25 for one \"ball\"), they were definitely worth a try.  I'm anxious to go back and try a Panzerotti!"}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich in the world. Panzerottos are snaking and huge. Pizza is awesome as we'll. Love how they expanded the sitting are for eating   The cashiers are always grumpy so that tells me the boss doesn't treat his staff right."}
{"text":"Stopped into Ricci's a while back.  Tried the pizza and panzerotti.  Loved the pizza... very similar to Frank's Pizzeria in Niagara Falls.  I was disappointed with the panzerotti.  The presentation was excellent, but the dough was a bit thin... taste wasn't really there.  I think most people would enjoy it, still a good product, but I've had better panzerotti at a number of other places, including Comino's in Whitby.  Friendly service, family atmosphere, counter ordering.  Pretty good experience overall.  Would definitely have the pizza again, maybe try the veal sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I work. I had a chance to grab a bite in the evening one day. I ordered the Baked Cheese Panzerotti to go.  Well, it was only the second time I had a panzerotti in my life. But this was the best and would be my standard to rate other panzerottis.  It was perfectly baked, tasted very good. The sauce (maybe it was marinara) they serve with it is to die for, perfectly seasoned and wasn't too acidic.  But the sad part was, as I was eating it, holding it in my hands, the cheese popped out from the other end. Maybe you're not supposed to eat it that way. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here as much as possible ever since we dined here originally about a month and a half ago. We also live about a half hour away. The food is so fresh and delicious! It IS like someone's Nona just made it for you! Restaurant is nothing fancy but it is clean and homey. Make sure to try the fried panzerotti, it is huge and you will never believe you could eat it all but somehow you magically will! They do not cut corners when it comes to quality, which is refreshing. Try this place for a casual lunch or dinner! YAY Ricci's!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: warm, trendy, polished Cleanliness: could use more attention Constructive criticism: Servers could clean their looks up a bit. They look like slobs. Cuisine: Italian Facilities: could use more attention Food: outstanding Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, Will reccomend. Parking: Private lot. tricky to get in and out of. Portion Sizes: large! Price: Good! Service:  Fair service speed for dining in. Although I do suggest calling in your order in advance to save the wait at the door during rush hours. Waitresses could stand to smile more and need a well groomed look. I seen many servers on different occasions wearing track pants that are ripped and dragging on the floor. This is the food industry, therefor, the way you present yourself is a direct reflection to the quality of the food you serve.  Selection: typical italian. Pizza, Pasta etc.  Note* deffinitley try a fried Panzzerotti!!!!!! Ricci's for the win!"}
{"text":"Pastas here are AMAZING! Such generous portions too! Great place to get for food delivery, food always comes hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Panzerotti was sooooooo good!! Splurge and indulge - go the deep fried way, you won't regret it! The dough is super flavourful, it was crispy and chewy. The sauce (sold separately) was soooooo authentic and delicious. So flavorful! The steak sandwich was also really good. Served on a kaiser type roll, it complimented the meat and absorbed the yummy sauce, in the best ways possible. The rice ball and meatballs on the side were okay. The panzerotti was truly the star. And a super generous portion!"}
{"text":"WHY is this place not closer to me?? Actually, it's better that it's not. I would get truly obese if it were, because my new diet would consist of fried dough, sauce and cheese. My husband and myself went to Sail and were looking for a place to pick up some dinner...just grab and go, since I had no groceries at home...but also didn't have the energy to go grocery shopping. I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, \"There is this good place nearby named Ricci's.\" That sealed the deal. Off we went.  The outside is hardly something to look at. The sign is faded and dirty and it looks, outside, like it's a dive. We went in a saw a modestly busy place, clean and a HUGE menu. You can eat in (seating is limited and similar to fast food seating), can get delivery, or get take out.   The menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK. We also got the rice balls.  Okay, rice balls first: Lightly breaded, gooey cheese on the inside and sauce for dipping them in....SO GOOD.  The panzerotti...well this is where they lose one star...not on the food itself, but because they messed up our order. One order was covered in a sheet of wax paper with the toppings listed on the inside...it was mine. But after a few bites I noticed, I was actually eating my husband's. We switched and then i noticed there were no toppings in mine at all! Just cheese and sauce. So they were mislabelled AND the order was messed up.   But OH LORDY, was that a great panzerotti anyway. Just melt in your mouth awesome....and that's after a 30 minute drive home!   I called up Ricci's and explained what happened and said I was too far away to come in again or to have something delivered and they gave me a credit for the panzerotti. The girl on the phone apologized and was very polite. So they fixed the problem to the best of their ability and it was amazingly delicious. Next time if I go back and the order it great...and not messed up, I think I'll have to bump these guys up another star!   Ohhhh man, get me BACK there!"}
{"text":"I used to work in the area so I came here quite often with co-workers.  One of my favorite place for Italian veal cutlet sandwiches and panzerottis .  Pizza is avg, crust is too thick for my liking.  But the place is great and has an old school atmosphere that I like.  Be forewarned though, the portions are massive!"}
{"text":"Heck yeah.. stopped in her on route from Vaughn Mills to Kleinberg on a random yelp search. Glad we did.... my friend ordered a steak sandwich which was ACTUALLY HEAVY... he was like \"yo bro, lift this\" and I was pretty pumped about the girth and weight of his food lol. I SHOULD HAVE got a sandwich but I saw too many good sauce choices for pasta so I did that up , can't remember the name but it was like a ravioli stuffed with ricotta, and the sauce was a cream sauce with bacon and onion. There was a massive amount of bacon visable in there and the bread with it sopped up the sauce real good , everything was yummy, even tried the bruschetta and that was great too. Need to go back again to eat one of those heavyweight sandwiches..... damn i''m getting hungry just typinig this."}
{"text":"Rice balls...don't bother. Like, at all.  Panzo...do bother. A lot.  Yelp says this is too short to be a review (more of a tip, says Yelp), so please extend by reading it twice. Thanks in advance."}
{"text":"Usually when I choose a restaurant, I want them to be the best at one thing, and that'll be enough to keep me coming back for life. For pulled-pork, I go to Phil's. For a taste of philly cheesesteak, I go to it's namesake. And for unbeatable panzarotti, I go to Ricci's.  There was a time where I'd go to Ricci's every Friday with a buddy of mine to get the same order. A \"panzo\" with sauce on the side and a pop. It's always under $10, drink and all, and I'm never ever disappointed. That's impressive after visiting for over 10 years.   The service is alright. They get the food to you in a reasonable amount of time. It's not really service with a smile. They're just a little rough around the edges without being outright rude. They're pretty much like any Italian from Woodbridge. They're not being loud to scare you, that's just their regular volume.  Regardless, as far as panzarotti goes, I have yet to find anywhere that can rival it. The sheer size and flavour of every single panzo thrown my way is unbeatable. I don't see an end to my visits to Ricci's. I don't see myself getting anything else on the menu either. Their panzarotti is just that good.  (Pro-Tip: Call in your order ahead of time. It's usually about 15-20 minutes to get a panzo cooked.)"}
{"text":"Great flavour on my veal sandwich and I think it's the first time I had the veal made to order in Woodbridge! The price was right too."}
{"text":"I've only been in Ricci's actual restaurant once, but have ordered delivery from there at least a dozen times.  Food always shows up piping hot and delicious, always within an hour. We mainly order in their amazing pastas and veal sandwiches, but we've also gotten the pizza and wings a couple times.  The wings are HUGE, probably the biggest I've ever had, and really good, however I wish they had more sauce options (BBQ and Honey Garlic are the only options, with heat levels accordingly).  The pizza is good, far from the best around, but good.  The pasta and sandwiches are just killer though. Hands down the best delivery in the area, bar none. The veal sandwich is amazing and I'm partial to the Penne pasta with the matrigiani sauce w/ sausage.   You really can't go wrong here, especially for delivery."}
{"text":"Came here to have a nice meal but was told at 9:03pm that they're not going to serve me beer because they stop serving alcohol an hour before they close, which was at 10pm. And this after the cashier took her sweet time taking my order because she kept leaving the station to talk to other employees and people there. What a joke. It was just 3 minutes over 9, 2 of which the cashier wasted during taking my order.   And I don't know why everyone is raving about the fried panzerotti. It's so damn oily. Full of oil. So bad and disgusting. I feel sick after just a couple of bites.   What an overrated, tasteless and discourteous place. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Excellent for a casual meal! It is always decently busy here when I visit-- and for good reason!  All of the pastas, sandwiches, salads I have tried here so far have been really good! The special sauces are really tasty and are definitely worth the upgrade. The portion sizes and prices are fair. I always either have food left over or are uncomfortably full if I actually finish everything!   I have not tried them yet, but the Panzerotti look HUGE and smell sooo good. I see so many people ordering it. Definitely next up on the to-try list!   The staff are quick and efficient and are able to keep up with all of the hungry patrons, even during lunch rush, so you never have to wait too long for your food.  If you're in the area, definitely give Ricci's a try! It is one of the better places to eat in this sad gray area."}
{"text":"I have just three words to say...Best pasta ever! I ordered carbonara which has always been my favourite and they didn't disappoint.  I also have to say the portions are huge especially for this price! Although I have to agree about the service , the waitress was extremely rude when I asked about how long it will take she gave me a dirty look... So next time I probably go with delivery option or take out."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza, great panzo's, and prices fairly reasonable. Staff and service is very friendly"}
{"text":"After all the great reviews, I just had to make my way here. The woman taking my order was friendly and helpful, which is the only reason they got one star. All this talk about the panzerotti... What I got was a soggy, greasy massive piece of dough with a lot of cheese and a few pieces of toppings (which I paid extra for) and the meat sauce had no meat! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Malton and at the age of 7, I used to grab a slice of Pizza at Ricci's almost every day after school for years. Then sadly, one day, they were no more.  I hadn't thought about it until recently when I was making pizza at home, and decided to add some fennel to it, which Ricci's slices always had a hint of. i think it was in the pepperoni. Anyways, I decided to google Ricci's Pizza just for the hell of it and was shocked to see that they were actually still in business! I thought they just closed up shop, but in actuality they just moved.  So, I finally made my way over to Vaughn, and checked it out. It's definitely different then the little tiny store they had way back when in the strip mall. They  have a large seating area, TV, and 3 registers.  I grabbed 2 pepperoni slices during my visit, and have to say that the pizza is as good as I remember it. It was like taking step back into my childhood. It didn't have that hint of fennel like I remember though. I guess they have different pepperoni now, but the rest is still how I remember it, down to the foil wrap they put the pizza in.  I was happy to see that the place was full of people, which means that they will be around for many more years, so that I can grab another slice whenever I'm in the area. If they decide to open up a location downtown, that would truly be amazing!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Vaughn... The veal sandwich and panzarotti were delicious... very filling... price was just right and friendly service."}
{"text":"So after eating in three times I've finally decided to write a review. I have only had pasta here and I have enjoyed it all three times.   The first time was back a few years ago when Ricci's was more of a takeout restaurant (and back when I was a vegetarian). There were good combos for a non-meater. Rosé gnocchi was my choice. It was a good one.  I don't quite recall my order the second time I came around but I remember that the restaurant was quiet, the service was fast. We dined outside as chairs and tables were set up for the summer. My partner liked his seafood pasta.  Third time. It was a busy Saturday night in January. I came with a group of 3 other friends. The restaurant was extremely cold. We ordered up front: bruschetta, fries, 3 pastas with rosé sauce: penne, agnolottix2, and tortellini alla vodka. Needless to say, the food was delicious. Food was prepared at a decent speed, but none of the staff attended the tables until prompted. As my friends and I chatted away and devoured carbs, we realized that the order of fries was forgotten. Before this, we asked two different people about it. In the end, we got a refund on the fries and a fresh hot order to make up for the mistake (though we were too stuffed to eat it at this point).  Overall, my experiences at Ricci's have been decent. Although service is lacking on a busy night, it's understandable considering the amount of staff on floor. The interior is not fancy but the food is always delicious. I will be returning again on quiet nights."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for my panzo while I sat and stared at my friend while she ate hers. We had to ask how much longer for mine to come out and the cashier said \"Oh, it's up in the window I just have to grab it!\"  Well, five minutes later she came out and asked what I ordered. Then returned another five minutes later and asked what register I ordered from (I don't know why that mattered). She then apologized and said she doesn't know what happened and they haven't started making it yet! She gave me the option of waiting for them to make one or getting my money back. Since I was starving at this point, I said I would wait (I was expecting my money back and the panzo for having to wait this long). To top it all off, the panzo finally arrives burnt and dry - a complete disappointment!! I definitely should have got some sort of reimbursement."}
{"text":"I had my first ever Panzerotti yesterday at Ricci's (thanks to Sarah B. for sharing) and it was mind-blowing. It was a basic one with cheese and tomato sauce. The dough was crisp and light and the stuffing was just sooo cheesy. You can order a side of sauce with it and yes, it is definitely recommended. The meat sauce was really delicious and added a nice touch to the panzo.   I came here with some fellow yelpers and I am so glad we chose Ricci's (can't go wrong with Kris's recommendation)! The staff was very friendly and our food came relatively quickly for the size of our order. Also, they were pretty good about bringing each of our dishes at about the same time.  We also ordered a large Neapolitan pizza with Soppressata and basil ($22 with taxes). Somehow the crust for it was a bit too crisp but the toppings were delicious! I also got to try some other pizzas (deluxe, margherita and meat lovers) all of which were pretty good! Definitely a great place to enjoy some tasty authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Come on Ricci's you have great food, would it kill you to give me a proper to-go container for my son's left over pasta? I've ordered delivery from you guys many times so I know you have proper to go containers. Even after asking for a better container than a styrofoam container, I was told that's all you have. And sure enough it made a mess in my car. Thank you."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Was directed here by the staff from Marotta's winery and they recommended the calzone type dish. I got mine baked with mozz, tomato sauce and roasted eggplant. It was heavenly and I was impressed by the freshness and quality. Thanks for a great lunch!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, good pasta, all around a great casual spot for some good eats."}
{"text":"Food was good..Not amazing. This is for the chickeb wrap and grilled chicken sandwhich. The prices are regular for a panini and wrap. Food was flavourful.. i wish it had a little more condiments..but it was delicious none the less. I would eat here if i wanted something fresh and only if i am in the area. I dont see myself goinf out of my way to come here..I didnr try the pizza but it did look good. The food came quick.. it was a busy evening (thursday) and they served me with a smile. I have no complaints.. it was juat simple and delicious. Notthing crazy."}
{"text":"AMAZING Panzos. Great pizza Wings are fantastic!  Pricing is a bit high for the food but it is good food.  I do go here often :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a baked Panzerotti with Italian sausage and green olive.  I like my food salty.  This is my first Panzerotti, so I have no reference to compare it against.  I can attest that it was filled with delicious tomato sauce and a thick layer of cheese.  It was very flavourful.  It was extremely filling for one person, and I won't be surprised if two ladies can share one as a meal.    Maybe because it was baked, the cheese didn't melted as much as the cheese in a fried Panzerotti that a fellow Yelper ordered.  I couldn't play that \"stretch the cheese into as long a string as possible\" game, but I saw someone play it with a fried Panzerotti.  Junk information just in case you want to stretch the cheese into a string."}
{"text":"greasy food, like OVER greasy, almost like it was fried once and then waiting to be ordered and then fried again once ordered.  Got the order wrong, then promised a credit for the next time.  when i called back to use my credit: no such credit existed!  Shifty people with simply BAD food.  Will not return and take my word , SKIP this place and go somewhere else.  Sandwiches are skimpy and pizza is all dough."}
{"text":"Wish I could develop my fondness for Italian food.. I am not Italian but surely I make better pasta dishes than a $10 lasagna at Ricci's. The bread for the veal sandwich became so soggy immediately after reaching our table.Anyways, to each his own."}
{"text":"You know this is a hidden gem when the sign is broken, you can barely see letter \"icc\", but there's still a huge line up inside.   I took one star off because of the rice ball. I had it in sauce, my friend had sauce on the side, both were MEH. I'd want to try panzerotto next time!"}
{"text":"It's a must to come & try their food! I've been here a couple times & I'm hooked. Place is clean, decor is nice, and their pastas specifically are delicious. Every time I come here it's always busy so don't be surprised!"}
{"text":"Yes this place has the best pizza in Woodbridge. The food is so good and well worth the long lines and wait time during lunch. They also have delivery in you're in the area, which is very convenient. They have pasta, pizza, sandwiches, soups, and salads.  Will definatly reutnr!"}
{"text":"they're getting it right.  Food is prepared well, delicious the last few times.  Portion size is good.  They have outdoor seating now, in front,  Television overhead to watch CP24.  It's a bit pricey, but there is something for everyone on the menu.       Lacks customer service. No owner or manager visible.  When tables are being cleared, the Chairs make an unGodly noise."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed this place during our visit to Toronto. Casual pizza shop atmosphere, but it was just what we were looking for.  I had the pepperoni and cheese Panzerotti, baked. It was delicious and filling. They don't skimp on these, the cheese and fillings were overflowing. The meat sauce on the side was excellent as well. Baked to perfection and a great meal.  My wife had fettuccine with the matrigiana sauce. The pasta was perfect and she fell in love with the sauce. It had just the right amount of kick.  My kids loved the pizza, too.  Only complaint would be I wish there were more beverage options."}
{"text":"I love love love Ricci's. Maybe it's because they spell my name right, or because they make substitutions with zero hassle, or maybe it's because their panzos are the size of an infant, who knows! All I know is I LOVE Ricci's.   In my past experiences I've ordered the asiago + prosciutto sandwich, rice balls and baked panzarotti. All of them have been amazing. Does it even matter what I write? With a review like Kris U's, you can't say no to dining here.  Long story made incredibly short, come here and experience Ricci's. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My wife and I have been coming here for 8 years.  The pizza, the pasta and sandwiches are absolutely fantastic!    It has recently been renovated and allows for a lot more comfort when dining or waiting for takeout."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. My favourite in the area now to go to. Prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty plentiful as well. Haven't been there to sit down, only have done take out, but very impressed regardless."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a friend today, clean place, not a long wait for the food, and it was a decent price I felt for the food. Had the veal sandwich, really fresh and yummy!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the food is good because...  I waited 10 minutes for the cashier to even look at me.  Then she said if you order it will have to be carry out.  It was 9:32pm and they said hey close at 10:00.  Rude poker faced cashier  said  YOU HAVE NO OPTION.    I said heck yes I do! And walked out to the sushi place a block away.  That place was awesome!"}
{"text":"Anyone who has rated higher then a 3 has had the Panzo for sure. Since that is the ONLY good food item they have. Don't expect anything less then 5 bucks here. Since a Pizza slice and a small pop will have you running to the nearest hotdog stand. Food is horrible, the service VERY rude and highly overrated. They take FOR EVER to actually get the order out. Its practically dead all times of the day but night. When its packed and they seem to get everything out quick then? I get you have an all women cashier but do they have to be so rude and talking crap about the customers once they leave.  I want food with a good employee service. Not a whole bunch of snotty women who act like they are better then everyone else."}
{"text":"Was here with some fabulous yelpers ^^ That's always a 5/5 !  I felt there was a discrepancy with the crispness of the pizzas. Loved how my single slice (omg it was huge... pretty much like 2 slices) of the gourmet pizza was so nice and crunchy. But my hubby's meatlovers (bacon, pepperoni, etc.) was no where near crispy. The good thing about the pizza crusts are there was no oil left on our hands after picking it up!   We also tried the basic fried panzerotti. I didn't like this in Italy, so I already had a feeling about this before tasting it.. lol But too starchy, too cheesy for my taste. It is definitely better w/ the sauce. Just get it! It will prob. taste better w/ other toppings other than the basic.   Looking fwd to the next quest for the best pizza in Tor."}
{"text":"\"Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well\" - Voltaire  Ricci's has a special place in my heart. This great restaurant was the source of our monthly pizza hot lunches back in elementary school. Although everyone knew that our school marked up the price by the slice for a small profit, we really didn't care since Ricci's pizza was amazing.  Their pizzas are lightly sauced, medium thickness, and lightly cooked. Its style is far from the classic neapolitan pizza; instead, they cater toward the neo-western Italian palate. Their gnocchi is fantastic, rich sauce, light dough, and fair portions. Their panzos are perfectly cooked, liberally stuffed with cheese and toppings.  Ricci's is the embodiment of that classic Italian nonna. But instead of paying her with kisses on the cheek, you pay her with money."}
{"text":"I work next door and often come here to pickup lunch. Love their lasagna and salads. Though I can understand some bad reviews, from time to time the food is not that great, though it's a rarity. Overall, solid 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening at 7pm with 9 other fellow yelpers to try their famous panzerotti and their pizzas.   I ordered the fried panzerotti ($8) with basic cheese and tomato sauce with a meat sauce on the side for dipping. We also tried the baked version but if it is your first time, go for the fried. Much tastier! And make sure you get the sauce on the side for dipping. It is imperative! I would say the panzerotti stole the show. It...was...awesome. So much cheesy goodness...mmmm....  Also ordered a small pizza again with basic cheese and sauce ($10.50). Lots of toppings to choose from but I had hoped they would have basil. You can order thin crust if you want which is a nice option. I just went with the standard and was very pleased. Delicious pizza! There was a little inconsistency with the crust when we tried different pizzas that were ordered among us but all in all a great experience and I would go back!"}
{"text":"This type of restaurant is exactly what I was looking for. No frills, good italian food with not much emphasis on the decor and fancy bells and whistles. So the prices were fair, portions are great, and taste is amazing. However, the pasta sauces are more New York/American style rather than the style in Italy (american style is much heavier and can be creamy). So if you're looking for authentic ITALY italian food, this isn't really it. But if you're looking for just great all around food, this is it"}
{"text":"It's all sooooo true, I got the sweet veal with cheese, and the cheese was oozing off of this thing, with two nice pieces of veal, you just can't go wrong.  The sauce was nice and tasty, but if anything they could but a bit more sauce.  I have past this place more times than I can remember, and read all the reviews here, and since we're new to the area, and want to try new places, this was a spot we definitely will be back to."}
{"text":"Best panzos in town. Love the pizza also. A hidden gem for as long as I can remember."}
{"text":"This is a solid option for a casual meal.   I've been here a number of times and I've always really enjoyed the food. I've tried the pizzas and pastas and really loved the flavours and portion sizes and even the prices are really reasonable. The last time I came here was probably the worst time however. I ordered a fried panzerotti and I was really enjoying my first few bites until I got to the middle and everything was still cold. I had ordered pepperoni, pineapple and green peppers and it just ended up being kind of wet in the middle with the cheese still cold and shredded. I was a bit disappointed but it was during their lunch rush so maybe it was a one-off. They also messed up my friends' panzerotti and gave her a whole bunch of toppings when she just asked for cheese. Again, it might have been due to how busy it was but maybe they need a better ordering system.   I also find the service to be really lacking, the girls working there really have no patience and come off as quite rude. It's not a big deal as there's no real table service, they just call your name and drop off your food. You do your ordering/pay at the front so I guess they don't get tipped as well as a regular sit down restaurant. Still, I think they can work on their friendliness just a bit.   I would of course come back, this is hearty, stick to your ribs Italian food and for the prices and portion sizes, I can deal with the service, take out is also a good option!!"}
{"text":"Wow, they had so much cheese in my panzo! It was great with the meat sauce for dipping. I could not even finish it I was so unprepared. The prices are a little higher than most fast food places around but you get much bigger portions.   Staff was quick and friendly and there seems to be a nice variety to their menu so there should be something for everyone."}
{"text":"Lovely place for the ones who like thick crust pizza. We had standard fair of pepperoni, green pepper, and mushroom as topping. The pizza is done right. Price might seems to be higher than other places, but even a small pizza is huge for us.   We also had ravioli on the side. The meat sauce that it served with is very good. However the pasta is a little bit undercook, but still enjoyable.   The panzerotti here also very good, order fried if you don't mind the extra greese. However it's still very good with the baked option. Always order meat sauce on the side, which brings it to the next level."}
{"text":"Very comfy and casual place to dine. Lots of sit in space and friendly staff.   Only went once and the food was good and portions were pretty big. First time eating a fried panzerotti and it was a little too filing for me. Had a pasta and the rice ball. Gf is vegetarian and she enjoyed the meal. Next time will try their sandwhichs to complete the review.  Lots of filling in the panzerotti. The wait was a little long for a \"fast\"-ish food place but worth the wait. Lots of parking too and nice weather. so was a good overall experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Really can't get enough of this place. Probably my favourite thing to order is the Panzo, Fried with the sauce on the side. The best panzo I've ever had! Big enough to take some home too. Wings are a great option too!   Only downfall about this place is the service, the waitresses aren't usually in the best mood and seem annoyed. Other then that, its amazing place and I love coming here!"}
{"text":"ordered a panzerotti. added pepperoni, italian sausage and mushrooms. the panzerotti cost $12.43.  honestly. one of the best, if not the best panzerotti i've had thus far. lots of cheese though. It was really heavy and i was amazed i was even able to finish it.  off topic side note. there were 3 cashiers. a blonde, brunette, and red head. sounds like the beginning of a joke right? seriously though. all 3. gorgeous.   back on topic. you can get your panzerotti baked or fried, i had mine baked because it's healthier that way (LOL).  the cheese was really really stringy, the panzerotti was stuffed. and it was well worth the money i spent on this bad boy of a food baby.  I am currently back at my desk at work and about to fall into food coma. im only working in this location for the day so it's really out of my way, but realistically i know i'm going to have a craving for this in the future and have to come all the way here out of my way to taste this heart clogging goodness again.  10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I completely agree Ricci's has hands down the best Panzerotto anywhere in Vaughan and in the GTA. There salads are huge and very flavorful, their pastas are fresh and also a great size.  If you're looking for amazing Italian food at a fast food atmosphere, Ricci's is the place to go.  Kudos on upgrading your location, very beautiful."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and it was by accident.. it was either here or Tim Hortons for a quick lunch and I decided to come here instead. Customer service is decent, straight to the point but patient.. I couldn't figure out what I wanted since it was my first time ever coming into this restaurant and you don't know what's good or bad.. so.. I kept it simple, lol. I ended up getting a capaccino with chocolate on top and a panzzeroti (Deep Fried) with goat cheese, prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes! The capaccino was amazing, I enjoyed every sip I took, fresh and great tasting, made me feel nice inside. The panzzeroti was delicious and I enjoyed every bite! It was huge! I still have left overs.. can't wait to be hungry again so I can finish it. hehe.. OH and the tomatoe sauce on the side was Amazing! So flavorful, I never knew a simple, basic tomatoe sauce on the siiiidde.. would taste so damn good? I recommend. The End."}
{"text":"Eveything tastes better when deep fried?!  Double Rice Balls with Tomato Sauce ($7.95) and Panzerotti ($8) with Tomato Sauce ($1)  Deep Fried goodness with cheese and sauce... Carb attack.  Those are the 2 things I highly recommend getting at Ricci's.  Enjoy and don't think about calories and fat content. You won't regret that!"}
{"text":"Ricci's is a great lunch time spot. They have a nice sit down area but the majority of my orders have been delivery.  I've tried a few pastas, a panzo and a sandwich which have all been great. The only item I would not recommend is the grilled veggie wrap. I've ordered this thinking it was a \"healthy option\" however the wrap was soaked in oil. Yuck!   Great portions, fresh ingredients and fair prices. I would recommend Ricci's to anyone for a quick but delicious italian meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!! Very pleasant environment! It is not the cheapest place to eat pizza but it is for sure worth the visit! The size of the pizza is very generous. The dessert with dulce de leche is very sweet so maybe it would be better to choose a slice of sweet pizza instead."}
{"text":"Ricci's is a huge Italian restaurant at the Langstaff Centre. When you walk in, the first thing you notice is how red everything is -- the lamp shades, the chairs, the sauce. I came here on a weekday around 1pm and the place was packed. It was difficult to find a place to sit, which only proves how popular this place is, but is a good indication that the food is also good.  After reading the other review, I had to order the baked panzerotti, which is essentially a giant calzone. I ordered the panzerotti with pepperoni and a small side of sauce. Once you place your order, you'll receive a pager and the staff will bring over your food when your pager goes off. Since it was busy here, it took a long time to receive my food, but the wait was worth it.  Growing up in the Bronx, I frequently purchased calzones at the local pizza shop, but it was definitely not the same as what I received at Ricci's. The panzerotti was huge! I was worried that I would not be able to finish eating it, but it was so delicious that the worry went away quickly. The panzerotti was amazing right out of the oven. The mozzarella cheese was perfectly melted and the sauce and pepperoni were tasty. The bread was perfectly soft. It's essentially a heart-attack wrapped inside beautifully soft bread.  The side sauce was unnecessary. The panzerotti by itself was tasty and moist enough. But if you do end up getting a side sauce, the small is sufficient."}
{"text":"This place serves better pasta than most \"fancy\" restaurants downtown. Double the portions for a third of the price and just as delicious if not better.   The panzerotti are amazing, the cheese is so hot and fresh when it comes out.   Fettuccine Alfredo is on another level. As is the penne a la vodka.   The chicken wings fly under the radar but they're legitimately as good/bigger/tastier than Allstars. Try them out next time you're there.   Whenever I want a quick, amazing meal I head here."}
{"text":"Okay, I know I just ate here, but I couldn't help myself....this time brought my son, my excuse to order more than one item so I can \"share\". We ordered up another panzerotti and a veal sandwich. The Panzerotti was fried (over baked) and was absolutely delish!!!  The veal was very good, had it medium so there were some green hot peppers inserted for a little more bang. Only thing I found was the bun of the veal was not toasted and was very soft and over breaded with the breaded veal in it, but not a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Favourite pizza spot.   Panzos are unlike any other. I prefer mine fried. Hot off the deep-fryer, the bread is doughy and crunchy in all the right places, the mozza is generous and melted to the perfect texture, and the side marinara sauce (topped with chilli flakes for me) offers the additional kick to guarantee every bite is devoured.   Quality is evident in both the service and ingredients. A go-to for all my family and friends; a piece of home that I miss whenever I'm out of town. 5/5 stars for great food, better prices, kind staff, and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this an extra star rating is because of the friendly staff.  I remember having Ricci's panzerottis back when I was a kid in Malton and they were fantastic.  However, the taste was bland of my baked panzerotti and the sauce could have had some type of flavour.  The dining room is more of a snack bar atmosphere and the waitresses cime out with your food and only find you by yelling your name out.  Sadly, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews we had to check this place out since we were in the area. At first when we walked in we couldn't figure out if we should sit and someone will take our order, or do we order first. If your wondering you must order first, pay, take a seat and someone will yell out your name and bring out your platter.  We ordered the basic panzerotti and added pepperoni and green peppers (for an additional cost). We also shared the lasagna. The lasagna was good but I highly recommend the panzerotti it was fantastic. The dough and ingredients they use are fresh I was completely stuffed. Make sure you bring an appetite."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing Panzerotti!  I got the baked and it was and it was huge!  It comes with cheese and sauce and added soppressata (which made the Panzo bit salty) and mushrooms to the mix.  It is very cheesy with not that much sauce that I expected  in the  Panzerotti so I suggest getting the sauce on the side, the meat sauce is really good.  Damn, the sauce is amazing, real traditional Italian sauce.  I came here with a group so I did sample some of the pizza and a fried Panzerotti which were all amazing.  Now I wish I was there right now enjoying another mouth watering Panzo while writing this review, lol.    I also had the wings (meduim), they were huge and cooked to perfection.  They were a little crispy on the outside and very moist.  The sauce was good too with a little kick, unfortunately they were drenched in the sauce so most of the sauce had to be wiped off for a full maximum wing eating experience.  I'd suggest asking for just a little bit of sauce on your wings and just get some dipping sauce on the side.    This shop was here for over 30 years and now it's recently renovated inside.  It looks old school on the outside, but the seating is good and it is spacious."}
{"text":"short and sweet.  excellent for pizza  excellent for sandwiches amazing prices."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place pretty recently! It's funny because I used to work nearby for 2 years and never managed to step in but I'm glad I did.  The way it works is you go in, order and pay and then the food is brought to your table. The prices were very reasonable and the staff were super friendly!  The portions were huge and my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed our meals. I got a veal sandwich and he got tortellini with white clam sauce. Both unreal!! (and I don't even like clam!)   Will definitely return, I need to try their pizza next! Heard great things"}
