{"text":"The owner of this restaurant take pride in using \"organic\" ingredients only.... Well.. That's nice... But their food is very salty.. Their pasta is the saltiest and their salad is extremely salty.. Their soup is okay.  Every time I eat at this place, I am drinking gallons of water. I wish they made their food less salty. It'd be much better to add salt on the side if anyone needs it. The only reason I came here was because there's no food place in the hospital..."}

{"text":"I popped into this caf√© on my way to an appointment in the area and an glad i did! The toasted western sandwich was great, the best I've had in a long time. Friendly and efficient staff. Also saw a variety of interesting salad items I'd like to explore more during a future visit."}
