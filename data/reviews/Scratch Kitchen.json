{"text":"I don't know where to begin.  Had the eggs Benny the only word I can use to describe it  GROSS.  The worst eggs Benny I've ever had.  The sausage was unreal, never finished my meal."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, so we had to wait for table, but it was only a 10-15 minute wait. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I got the breakfast poutine with pork and my boyfriend got the Fat Daddy Pancake. My poutine was great and really hit the spot after a night out- it was also huge and I ended up taking almost half of it home. The Pancake was good, it kind of had the taste and consistency of a cinnamon cake. Unfortunately, it was raw in the middle so not much of it was eaten. Other than that, I would definitely go back and recommend checking the place out for a big, hearty brunch dish."}
{"text":"I would recommend... You don't come here. I've been here a few times before and it was ok. They revamped their menu so now the one item I liked is gone. But the real reason for this review is the lack of appropriate customer service. My partner and I came here today, excited to spend some time together and have brunch. From the moment we sat down it was a disaster. Firstly, if you're a vegetarian and don't like eating ONLY carbs, you won't find this menu appealing. And the staff WILL NOT make any substitutions. I asked that the bacon be changed for something else as I don't eat meat. \"We can't alter anything on the menu. If you want to add a salad it will cost you $5\". That would bring up my meal to $20 for an egg... A pancake and a salad. Hmmmm no. Then I said.. Ok I'll go for the veg Benedict, sauce on the side. \"No we can't do sauce on the side\". Our waiter was so flustered by our questions, he kept scratching his head (maybe that's where they got the name) and retreating to the chef only to be shot down. We ended up just leaving. Why would we spend our hard earned cash on a disappointing and expensive meal? No thank you. We went to uncle Betty's instead and they were accommodating at every turn. So do yourselves a favour and pass!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this spot! It's got an amazing downtown vibe in an uptown setting. I have not been able to find many good brunch spots in this area - this is by far my fav!!  Freshly baked bread. Amazing bacon! To die for fat daddy pancake.   This is now our go to weekend brunch spot. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Great service and explanation of the menu...make sure to ask because it's not just breakfast it's better! Coffee solid and the rancheros were incredible.  Shared the waffle among 4 of us and it's so unique and crispy. The poutine was very impressive and super filling.  Friends had the Benedict with brisket and it was tasty.  While I am not a fan of pancakes others raved about the thick style.  Highly recommended after a late night:)"}
{"text":"This is a tough one...  I went when it first opened and it was really good-seemingly more wholesome farm fresh ingredients and fresh baked bread.  Service was kind of questionable not in that people were in any way nasty more so they seemed chronically understaffed.  The biggest issue going back was the scary price increases. For the money back when it opened it was well worth it, now for the money it just doesn't seem good anymore..."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't give this place a 5 star is crazy. It is the best breakfast place to open up in this neighbourhood in years. Three words - Fat daddy pancake! Also in-house cured bacon. So good."}
{"text":"Opened Dec 2014.  Hipster through and through. Besides Ideal Coffee, it's the only hipster place on Yonge St between Lawrence Ave and the 401.  SERVICE Informative about local/made-from-scratch ingredients, but not preachy or overly pretentious like many similar concepts.    FOOD/DRINK As the name suggests, it's made \"from scratch.\"  They make their own bread, but I think the hens would be upset if I suggested they made their own eggs. ;) They are pretty much a breakfast, lunch and brunch place but they have a VERY limited sandwich, cheese board, and beer/wine menu for the evening.  There are only about 4 each wines (2 local, 2 European) and beers.  Not spectacular wines, but they're fine for the food served and new restaurant that focuses on AM fare. LOVE wine can be ordered by the ounce!  Beers are not your average run of the mill which is great for their menu approach; these match the vibe more.  The Fat Daddy skillet pancake with mixed-in pear pieces is AMAZING in name and taste.  Never had anything like it.  They must whip egg whites into it because it souffles a bit ---- so it's really puffy but definitely not a pop over. It was made better because they provide real maple syrup (which it almost doesn't need since it's so tasty).  They have a Red Fife bread that tastes \"healthy.\"  They also have a baguette.  The breads are good, don't get me wrong.  But I think they need a softer bread that gives more for their sandwiches (more like a roll) since the baguette cut my mouth to shreds.  The sliced baguette is great for the cheese board or with the jams/spreads, but neither were good for sopping up runny egg yolks.  I fully appreciate that it's a major effort for a kitchen to make bread from scratch, but I think their menu would benefit in a big way from a third bread type as they get established.  My dinner guest liked the bacon that is cured in house, but I prefer a more traditional briny tasting, thick cut bacon whereas this tasted more meaty like well-done dark pork meat.  The bread pudding was made to order, so it can take a while.  I'm not a fan, preferring a dense, heavy custard version (sliceable from a loaf pan) with some raisins and cinnamon. This was a fairly plain custard. Still, it was comfort food, and it was a treat to have it fresh out of the oven.  They were great about topping up coffee.  Nice to be able to enjoy some local apple cider for breakfast for a change.  I adore the REAL FOOD kids menu, but I don't think the ambiance will appeal to kids under 5 that have to be over stimulated by iPads all the time (it's not Rainforest Cafe).  However, it is a fairly forgiving atmosphere.  AMBIANCE, SEATING & GROUPS Narrow space with open concept kitchen in the back. An entire wall is dedicated to a chalkboard menu that's hard to read when seated next to it, which is more than 3/4 of the seating.  Not to worry; they had a printed menu, too.  However, those sitting next to the chalkboard get the best view of the 2 TV screens above the 4 or 5-seat bar.    I believe there were only 4-seater tables; they might be able to turn them to accommodate groups, but I think it will be rather challenging for guests or servers to get by.    Dim evening lighting is offset by the big screen TVs.  No romantic ambiance, but a good place to unwind.  ACCESSIBILITY Washrooms are downstairs like most area Yonge St restaurants.  A small step up then a sharp bank to the right before entering left into the restaurant; this will likely pose challenges to wheel chairs, strollers or walkers.  The chairs pull away from tables to accommodate wheelchairs though.  I do not recall arms on chairs.  PROBLEM PARKING BE WARNED:  At Loblaw grocery next door, they have a security guard who does nothing but ticket or tow those who park there and walk over to these businesses on Yonge; signage cautions you not to do this in fact.   This is the place where Yonge STREET (major street) and Yonge BLVD intersect. Extremely challenging to get parking here.  Only 2 street parking spots on that short block, but several full blocks of metered street parking south of Glen Echo Rd; no rush hour parking on Yonge St.  PLEASE don't steal those 2 spots in front since many elderly really need them for Smith Pharmacy!  There is no parking the first block or so on immediate side streets (Glen Echo, Teddington, Yonge Blvd).  Southbound Yonge Street parking is restricted from turning onto Glen Echo nearly all day except Sundays.  Green P parking is waaaaay down the steep hill behind Miller Tavern or 5 blocks south.  OVERALL I'll definitely go back.  It's refreshing to have something different in the neighbourhood finally.  Strong potential to be 4+ stars. I think they are working out kinks of being a new business and having a skeleton crew, though.  It is endearing to see them be so dedicated and earnest.  I hope the low foot traffic and limited parking options will not be a deterrent for customers since it is the best food concept I have seen at this addre"}
{"text":"Overrated. Our party ordered a variety of dishes and none were spectacular. Food was average. French toast was bad."}
{"text":"SLOW service.  Waited like 30min for the scramble egg dish.   Very NOISY there. Food was just so so.  There are much better places nearby."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after reading it on one of the Toronto Eat blogs. We arrived for 1:30pm and no line ups but the place was pretty busy. We got a table immediately. Our waitress was prompt and came back to ask for orders. My husband and I, shared the pancake and bacon&eggs. Fresh ingredients, good portions and quite tasty! Couldn't finish the pancake! Staff was quite nice and informative as well. Would come back!"}
{"text":"They put meat stray bits of meat in a meal for someone that informed them that they are vegetarian.   Don't trust them."}
{"text":"Dissapointing. our previous experience of scratch Kitchen was poor but we decided to give it another go. Service was slow, 30 mins wait for eggs and bacon. Then when it did come the food looked like it was thrown on the plate and the portion sizes were very small. I wouldn't mind but I was given half a poached egg and the server acted very indigent when I complained. It's a good concept but very badly implimented."}
{"text":"Food was not good. One of the worst bfast I've ever had.  Bacon and eggs, eggs overcooked and the sides burnt (how is that even possible?), hardly any bacon, focaccia bread raw undercooked.  Friend got the Big Daddy pancake, greasy and not that tasty. Not even any fruit or icing sugar with it. We had to ask for maple syrup;they don't give it with the pancake.   Service was great and they tried to remedy the eggs but they were disgusting both times. Never had my coffee refilled once.   Nice decorations and mood, but if the food is no good. What's the point. Just another place trying to be overpriced hipster.  May try it out again for dinner drinks as they have decent craft beer. But never again for bfast."}
{"text":"They don't have a ton of choice for brunch, but it's a good solid choice for brunch.  We got there around 1pm and there wasn't a wait at all.  I ordered their BLT which included their in-house cured bacon and came with a side of salad and home fries.  The dish as a whole was great and the portion was just-right."}
{"text":"Friends and i had brunch at Scratch Kitchen this weekend- we ordered the Eggs Benedict, Breakfast Poutine and Soft Scrambled- they were all delicious! The baileys latte is a must, and the sangria and liqueur cider were impressive! The service was excellent and we definitely will return and try these Fat Daddy Pancakes with all the great reviews."}
{"text":"Service: Sat at the bar.  Had to get own menu.  Did not get flatware or napkins until I asked, and that was after food was served.  Did not get ordered drinks and one of 3 meals came as we tried to leave.  Overall, pretty slow, and not too worried about whether we had what we ordered it seems.  Food: 2 bones found in my pulled pork sandwich.  Sandwich had been sitting in its juices long enough that one piece of bread was dissolving. Fish and chips - fish was pretty blah. Fries were not bad."}
{"text":"Scratch was always awesome for breakfast however now with Boris the new owner DINNER IS AMAZING!  The veal Marsala is the best I've ever had both  have in  Canada and in Europe! ! The sweet potato straws are to die for! ! Do yourself a favour and enjoy a marvellous dinner at Scratch! ! Yummy and devine!!"}
{"text":"A buddy and I went for lunch today and it was fabulous. I had the BLT which was an amazing sandwich and he had the soft scrambled eggs on toast. We will go again. Local beers, local honey, organic flour the guy is very careful to ensure his flavours work. Congrats great start. Parking in the area is tough but doable on meters. Make sure you allow enough time"}
{"text":"Very good food, and lots of it, at a good price. All made from scratch (thus the name!), and using fresh, local ingredients. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for Brunch on a Sunday which coincided with Mothers Day and the resulting fixed menu. Options were French toast or pulled pork eggs bene. Girlfriend and I opted for the latter. The food arrived with my dish missing one of the main components, the pulled pork and the accompanying slice of cheese (the waitress actually noticed the cheese was missing). They took it back and returned it to me with pulled pork & cheese thrown on top of the egg. The other benes' eggs were overdone and the salad was missing 2 of the 3 accompanying toppings. Hollandaise was a little too thick. It's hard to understand how these mistakes could be made given the fact (i) the place was  about half full (ii) The menu options were French toast or eggs bene (starters was a cup of oats and yoghurt/Dessert was a small scone) and (iii) excluding a washer and a couple of waitresses there were 4 people on the food stations. As we were discussing these points my Girlfriend stopped to remove a hair which was in her salad. Not their finest hour. The waitress was kind enough comp us one of the meals (Fixed price of $20!! And I thought Buca was overpriced) . The wait staff were the only positive experience in what was a very underwhelming and disappointing brunch. A return visit, especially with a bigger menu, is highly unlikely."}
{"text":"The good: house made fresh bread, farm fresh organic eggs The bad: slow service (we waited over 30min for bacon+egg and a soft scramble), slow scramble too salty, bread was already cold, small menu Verdict: will not be returning"}
{"text":"Disappointed considering how popular this place appears to be on a weekend morning. Service is SLOW...although the servers were very nice, we waited over 30 minutes for our eggs to arrive...that is not acceptable. They need to figure out how to keep up with the orders...hope these are just growing pains. Now for the food....the concept of organic and house made all sound good. The eggs had a beautiful orange yolk and although the bread was good it was not toasted....didn't like that when you're dunking in soft eggs. Now for the pancake....we ordered a kid's pancake and it was pretty much raw on the inside...dense and uncooked. When we brought this up to the chef, who happened to be walking by, he took it back, without apologies and about 10 minutes later we received the same pancake that had been thrown back on the grill. Seriously??? He didn't even give us a new pancake...poor poor form. So, slow service and bad form on the issue of pancake...will not be returning to this spot! So many better brunch spots in the city people!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday my fiancé and I went to Scratch Kitchen after weeks of intending to pop in for a good brunch.    This was the absolute worst brunch experience we've ever had!    We ordered their famous Fat Daddy skillet-pancakes, and it took 45 minutes for them to bring us the wrong pancakes, and pancakes that were COMPLETELY burnt to a crisp.  Even the table next to us were shocked.  When we told the waitress, she said our correct order of pancakes were in fact ready in the back, but equally as burnt as these.  We ended up walking out an hour and a half after arriving hungry, disappointed and angry about the quality of food and customer service.    Words of caution:  If they manage to burn 4 Fat Daddy pancake orders in a row, and still try to serve them, there's a big problem.  Only redeeming quality: the free waters were nice."}
{"text":"We had to walk out, first time I've ever walked out on a restaurant after already ordering food.  The 2 people at the table next to us were waiting 90 minutes for their food, when it finally arrived it looked like it was cooked in 3 minutes and thrown on the plate. Would have been nice if the manager had offered them free coffee (or something) while they waited. Small portion, large plate, runny undercooked food - were the comments from the 2 people.  When I realized I'd ordered the same breakfast we started to worry. Then we saw a worker pour new water into the coffee machine - yellow water. Then we saw the disorder of the kitchen - cooks were out in the hallway next to the kitchen tossing, mixing, preparing food - didn't feel very sanitary. It felt like the restaurant's first day open, they were completely overwhelmed - but I believe they have been open for several months.  Will not return, there are other options in the area. Too bad, great location, would like to see something better managed open up in its place."}
{"text":"Wait was long but not sure if the food was worth it. It was fine, nothing wrong but not worth the hype"}
{"text":"We tried brunch in this place. They have a full menu for bennies which is awesome. We also order the sugo in their menu which was a unique option and hardly find in all restaurants.  We will  absolutely go here again to try their famous Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  This is a cute little brunch spot that I believe opened up less than 2 months ago.  It definitely has the potential to be 4 STARS but I think they need time to work out some kinks.  It's pretty busy on weekends so they definitely need more staff to get service and seating going a little quicker.  It seems if you get here before 11am on weekends you should have no wait...but anything after and there is a line up.  The food is pretty good and pretty decent sized portions.  I had the grilled cheese which comes with salad and home fries.  Overall it was good - the homes fries had that nice crispy texture that I love.  I did have to as for ketchup like 3 times  - they were just so busy they couldn't keep up.  They have daily specials on their chalkboard and take your order via ipad.   The menu is pretty limited in selection in comparison to other places, but for me that is not a bad thing - i don't like places where they menu is a book.  Too many choces overwhlem me.    I will definitely give this place another chance in a few months to see if they ironed out any of the kinks"}
{"text":"I ordered \"The Big Breakfast\" at Scratch, consisting of chocolate chip pancakes with over easy eggs. The eggs came over hard and were fully melted into the pancake. The waitress tried to make some excuse about how they cooked their eggs..... Eggs are one of the easiest things to make - sorry waitress, no excuse will make up for the hard eggs. The waitress then went on to ask if I wanted new eggs.... Without considering the fact that half my pancake was covered in hard yolk.   To summarize, 1 of 2 \"over easy eggs\" was fully broken. The other egg was over hard. Half of my 1 pancake was covered in the yolk from the broken egg.   Service was brutal and prices are sky high ($16+tax for 2 eggs, 1 pancake, bacon). Not worth a second try."}
{"text":"We had the big daddy pancake and chemini mushroom sandwich for Sunday brunch.  The portion size and food taste were ok but not worth the price. Bacon was very salty. Service was slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"Visited Scratch for a late brunch Saturday. Very nice and cozy space and it was not busy when we arrived. We were seated right away near the back and set up with cutlery and water but this is where the glitch in service occurred.   We sat there for 20 mins before our waitress came back to take our order like they had forgotten about us. It may have been due to the large group who came in after who appeared to be friends or family with the wait staff and kitchen staff.   So we wave down our waitress and order the steak and eggs and the Fat Daddy pancake.   The pancake is enormous and very tasty. I'm not usually a fan of pancakes but this one passed the test. The edges were surprisingly crispy and it was not soggy in the middle. The poached pears added a nice tartness to balance out the sweetness of the maple  syrup that was already added to the pancake when it arrived. Only thing would be I would ask for the butter on the side next time.   The steak and eggs were nice. Nothing bad to say, just a very typical brunch dish. The only complaint my boyfriend had was the portion was skimpy.   Overall, it's a nice brunch spot midtown. The lines are crazy and the food is good.   Will go back... Hopefully we won't get lost again in a crowd of their friends and family..."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cute on the inside with a artisanal feeling to the BOH Their fat daddy pancake is the best out of everything I ordered. But be warned it fills you up"}
{"text":"Came to Scratch Kitchen on a Sunday morning (around 10ish). Wasn't too busy during that time but it picked up really quickly. A line up formed as we were leaving. First thing you would notice is the big chalk board menu and their open kitchen style. They have a liquor license and serve wine by the oz. Onto the food. Like the name of the restaurant \"scratch kitchen\", the food was made from scratch - from bread/jam to their own cured bacon. We thoroughly enjoyed our food. I loved the fat daddy pancake and pulled pork sandwich. My friend loved his grilled cheese and bacon sandwich. Staff are friendly and our coffee was refilled often. We would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I struggled with how to rate this. I had the omelette which was truly exceptional. Nice light salad in the side and the allowed me to switch out the home fries for the homemade Foccacia. Husband had the bacon and eggs which he thought were good but nothing special. It was chaotic when we got there with the front door just jammed. I think they got overwhelmed very quickly."}
{"text":"Terrible food and slow service. Found big chunks of egg shell in my pancakes after half an hour of wait while the restaurant only has one other table. Very disappointed. The only good thing is that at least the pancake was taken off my bill."}
{"text":"I would have given this place three stars if it's not for their famous \"Fat Daddy Pancake\". It is literally the best pancake in Toronto in my opinion. The only better one I have ever tried is the pancake desert at Le Mremner in Montreal.   Scratch Kitchen is quite popular for its brunch and there is always a lineup. They have different brunch menus every time I am there, and there was a time when I was totally obsessed with their pancakes, I went to Scratch Kitchen back to back in one weekend. Their pancakes are extremely delicious: super buttery, socked in real maple syrup, big and fat, and served with very tasty homemade berry or orange topping.It seems that their topping are different day to day. It is only $9. I wouldn't say I am a big fan of any other items on its menu, but I can never say no to their pancakes.   I also like the decoration of Scratch Kitchen a lot, especially the flying pigs drawing on the black board. How adorable they are!!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this place for the very subjective reason that it is around the corner from my boyfriend's house.  Otherwise, it is a terrible spot, and is why I hate going to his house-- smack in the middle of York Mills and Lawrence, and a pain in the ass walk from either.  Not a good spot for food traffic.  That being said, it's worth the walk.  I've been quite a few times, and usually the service is pretty great, though sometimes a little slow (you have to be willing to make a few reminder calls to the servers).  The bartender is stand-out-- she's remembered random requests for drinks and specially made favorites no longer available (the rhubarb margarita) on many occasions.   The menu rotates, with a few staples.  The bread is awesome, but they never give me enough (it's brunch! I want a whole basket!).  I'm a vegetarian, so I haven't sampled their house-cured bacon, but the consensus is that it's fantastic.  The environment is laid back and the kitchen is open, it's clean, the beer is local, and the staff are knowledgeable. I've been for dinner once, and it held up as well as brunch did.  Great addition to the neighborhood.  Wish it was in a spot where it could get more foot traffic, but I suppose that's a win for me."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot! Service was friendly and very fast. Got the tomato poached eggs and a side of pancakes to share with my friend.   The tomato sauce was delicious - you can tell it's an old world recipe that's been passed down or something. So flavourful and rich. The eggs came with pesto toast, and the bread was thickly cut and generously spread.   The side of pancakes came with mascarpone and rhubarb purée with real maple syrup. The pancakes were dense and delicious I wanted to eat more!  Definitely a great little spot in the neighborhood and would even be worth a drive."}
{"text":"Came here a few days back for brunch. my boyfriend& I had no idea the place was about to close but they welcomed us inside. I ordered the BLT which was really well done and had a fresh and light side salad & house fries. Richard really wanted pancakes and they surprisingly still made it for him even though they had to make a whole new batter. The pancakes are honestly really on point. It's really huge too. Service was great, they were attentive & super friendly !!"}
{"text":"Brand spanking new restaurant, right next to my beloved macaron joint!  I had the prix fixe menu for dinner, which was $25 for 4 courses. The first course to come were 2 fresh raw oysters. These were smallish but decent. There wasn't the usual array of sauces to season the oyster with, but had the basic Tabasco and lemon slices.  Second course was cured Chinook salmon on bitter greens, with pickled beets and goat cheese emulsion. It came with a side of fresh Dijon mustard seeds, which gave off just the tiniest kick. The salmon was fine, and goat cheese mixed in well with flavours.  Third was the main, which was beef short ribs, braised apple, dirty mash with whiskey pork gravy. The portion was just right. The ribs were yummy, one rib being nice and fatty, the other one lean. The apple gave sone sweetness to the dish and my table all loved the dirty mash.  Dessert was a good sized apple crumble topped with some 10 year aged cheddar. Omg, the aroma was AMAZING! I'll go back just for this alone!   House wine was $1 per ounce, which is nice if you want just a few social sips. I'm very social, so I got 5 oz :)  The bad - the layout of the tables seems a bit off. I think maybe they rearranged the tables out of their usual location to accommodate for our large party (12 people) but there was only a foot of room to pass through. Also, the playing doesn't seem very uniform. My dessert dish would have a teensy drizzle of caramel, and a chunk of cheddar, while my friend had no caramel and a whole sheet of cheddar! Scratch must still be working to be consistent.  Overall, I would definitely come back. The food itself was delicious and adventurous, and I'm curious to see the next menu!"}
{"text":"Should I be getting off at Lawrence Station and walk north? or York Mills to walk south? Coming to this stretch of Yonge Street always post a challenge but Scratch Kitchen for brunch/lunch totally worth it!  We arrived around Sunday 2:30 to an almost empty restaurant. Great to avoid the weekend brunch rush.  What should I eat? Most of the breakfast item is reasonably priced from $7 and with everything made from \"Scratch\" and locally sourced, they sure means good value!  We shared:  Fat Daddy Pancake ($9) skillet-baked pancake with poached pears and real maple syrup  Sausage and Eggs ($9) Berkshire Pork Sausage with 2 free range eggs, home fries and homemade bread  Pancake was so fluffy, buttery and light but a little crispy outside. Highly recommended!   Friday night they have prix menu which changes every week in what's on the menu and how much. Waitress advised us to call Wednesday if we want more details.  Scratch Kitchen has a lot of potential and I definitely would be back for some craft beer!"}
{"text":"Small. Very very small. . We were a group of 12 people and had made reservations weeks in advance to reserve the basement for brunch. We got there and nothing was done. Waited 15 min till finally going downstairs to see that the tables were still not set up.  The service was horrible and the food were extremely small portions and not very satisfying. 10 menu items.. Nothing to eat if u don't want breakfast.  No salads.. Tisk tisk!  The steak and eggs came with literally 4 slices of tiny pieces of steak, 7 little hasbrowns and 1 Slice of burnt toast soaked in butter..  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Right on the cusp of urbanity on Yonge, I generally like the space Scratch is in.  Narrow and long, it feels smaller than it is and is quite comfortable.  I like the giant chalk board outlining their menu and options and that the front opening melts away to take advantage of good weather.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the food.    I had the 'Fat Daddy' pancakes after having run a half marathon and having a big hunger. I found the pancake that came disappointing.  It was heavy and greasy and particularly tasty.  I also tried the 'Caprese and Eggs' which was almost entirely tomatoes and not exciting.  Lastly, the service was poor.  Our wait time to be served was very long and generally it was very inattentive.  We collectively left disappointed"}
