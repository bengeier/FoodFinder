{"text":"I've only had the spicy chicken wrap so I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but man, I sure do love those wraps. Especially when the pita is freshly made-it's delicious. My favourite thing about the wraps is the light orange/yellowish spicy sauce they give with it as well as the salsa. SO delicious, I come back almost every week. Only thing that i'd say is bad about it is if you get the sauce inside the wrap instead of on the side it gets a little watery and messy, but if you don't mind the mess it's quite good!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Chicken not properly marinated. Did a take out and had to throw out half of it."}
{"text":"I wish I could actually just give no stars because this place is horrible. Don't bother going here at all! Absolutely the WORST customer service I've ever experienced!! The girl who was taking my order seems like she has no idea what they have or don't have or anything for that matter. No Mt order was not complicated. Literally went in to get a chapli dinner and tandoori chicken dinner. First they didn't have the chapli then they had it. Then I wasn't allowed to order the tandoori chicken as a dinner unless I got a different skewer of meat with it and then they didn't have it all. Finally talked to another lady who says yes we have that that's okay, and punched in my order. The other girl goes oh I though you were saying lunch and I said no... I didn't say anything to do with lunch combo all I said was I wanted a chapli combo and tandoori combo which apparently you couldn't do? I thought that was it. When I went back in to pick up the order I had asked her if they give sauce, she said yes one. I'm like one each or one all together? She said one each.. Then goes oh do you want white sauce and I say yes please, she gives me one... One for two orders.. Okay. Fine whatever. I come home. The sauce I kid you not was a less than even half of the container, it actually looked like someone had eaten out of it and they gave what was left. I called them, and I realized that this is why it's empty inside the restaurant, they're all rude! He told me that that's how they do it because people waste it and that it's expensive. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING A RESTAURANT IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE?! honestly I never complain about places, and had these guys acts been atleast nice or respectful I would have been okay but they're plain rude and shouldn't be running a business. If you're messing up, own up to it! People will come back if you're atleast good with service. I have and still work in a retail environment so yes I'm aware how hectic it can get. But the least you can do is own up to your mistake and atleast try n see what you can do to better your service."}
{"text":"Chapli Kabob, a restaurant specializing in Afghan kabobs and grilled meats had their grand opening mid-May 2016. The newly renovated restaurant is located in a small strip plaza with an Indian Pakistani grocery store. Inside there was plenty of seats for dining in. Similar to other fast food restaurants, customers order at the counter and are assigned a specific order number.  The menu consists of chicken, beef, fish and lamb dishes (no pork) marinated in house made seasoning and Afghan spices. Customers can order lunch portions that come with a salad and naan, or dinner portions that has the addition of rice. The menu also has wraps, skewers, and karahies (stew), as well as side orders and dessert.  I ordered the slow cooked spiced lamb shank dinner and it was only $11.49. I was impressed that they would offer lamb shank at a fast food restaurant as it takes hours to make it tender. The basmati rice with raisin and carrots was lightly spiced and went well with the lamb. The naan was served hot and thicker than the naans I have eaten at Indian restaurants. The salad comes with a light yogurt dressing and the tomato based hot sauce (similar to a salsa) was incredible. I asked for several bowls of the hot sauce and put it all over my rice.  My friends and I had a chance to sample the chicken breast kabob, saltani kabob, tandori chicken, Chapli  kabob, as well as the salmon kabob (will be on the menu soon). Chapli kabob, their specialty dish, is a must order with 2 large ground beef patties marinated with Afghan spices. Since there was a little price difference between lunch and dinner, we all ordered the dinner portion.  All the dishes were flavourful and well seasoned/spiced. The only improvement is that some of the meats and fish was slightly overcooked for my liking. This is the first time I have tried Afghan food, so I do not have a comparison point. If I am in the area, I would definitely return.  Overall: In a busy plaza in Mississauga, Chapli Kabob provides authentic Afghan dishes with huge portions at great prices. The restaurant looks clean and inviting, and a great lunch, dinner or take out spot. Ask for extra hot sauce since it is really good."}
{"text":"I came on a random day. I have a habit of getting Afghan food when I visit Mississauga. I'd say Chapli is about the same quality as the other places I tried. They have more or less the same selection as other places. Tastes about the same too (very good). Prices about the same too.   I have no complaints. It's definitely a consideration when i visit that area in Mississauga."}
{"text":"We are very surprised to see that this place only has 3 stars. We've come here a few times now and love it! The food is great, portions are generous, preparation is fast abd the customer service is excellent. The lamb shank is spectacular. I highly recommend Chapli Kebob!"}
