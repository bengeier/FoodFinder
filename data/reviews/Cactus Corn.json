{"text":"I have had quite a bit of Kettle Corn in my day...(more than I can confess!) but Cactus Corn is hands down, the very best. Prices are good, served hot and fresh...and the stuff has an addicting quality that proves it is top notch! I will be looking for Cactus Corn in my travels around the Phoenix area this fall season. Hope I can find them!"}
{"text":"It was decent, only discrepancy is that the owner or manager was being very disrespectful with his employees. Talking down to them,I only came to get some delicious kettle corn, not hear about their \"dirty laundry\" very unprofessional, I don't need to hear about your failing business."}
{"text":"I had Cactus Corn at Zoolights this year and it was fantastic!  Great value for the price also. My kids loved the popcorn and the service was great. The guy told me that they are also in Chase Field and Spring Training locations.  If your looking for a great popcorn vendor you should check them out."}
{"text":"If I could give them more stars I would! This review is for the location at Chase Field. Everytime I go to a game I have to get me some. I have tried all of their flavors and all are wonderful. Even the cinnamon almonds are delish! They also have set up a stand at Salt River Fields for the Spring Training games. Go try them!"}
