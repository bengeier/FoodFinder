{"text":"It is very cheap and the service is quick. The waiters do not speak very much english. 
The $5 pitchers of beer are definitely the main attraction.
I wish the cups were a little cleaner"}
{"text":"My son and I wandered in here on a rainy Monday night and were surprised by the deliciousness of our meal. We ordered the eggplant with green beans, lamb dumplings, and noodles with shredded pork and vegetables, and every dish was a winner. It was nice to get a taste of something a little different too (their focus is northeastern Chinese cuisine). Great value and we love the name. :) Will definitely be back. In the words of aforementioned 7-year old son, \"the restaurant is awesome and good and excellent and yummy!!!\""}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience after Michaelangelo at the AGO today, it was like walking into the Cameron House in the mid 80s--a table of old guys drinking and being a bit loud. The reviews here about the cheap beer have explained what three old white guys were doing in this place on a Friday afternoon LOL
We ordered the Spinach Salad with Nuts and Fruit and one of the eggplant dishes--there were four on the menu!! Both were excellent. 
I also enjoyed the documentary on the Hainan Island textile industry that was on the tv close captioned in english :-)
Overall a prime urban experience. Magical!"}
{"text":"First of all, I am Northern Chinese but I grew up in Canada. Almost a decade ago, I visited Toronto and went to a restaurant that was simply the best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. Now that I am living in Toronto, I have been trying to discover this restaurant. A few months ago, I discovered this was Ten Mile Aroma.

I am writing this review to respond to surprisingly bad reviews I see on Yelp. I simply have no idea how this could have happened. I really hope there is some confusion or else I doubt these people have taste buds. Yes, I am right and all the negative reviewers are wrong and have no idea what they are talking about. And you know what? It was awarded one of top 100 of the best Chinese Restaurants in North America in 2013 by the Chinese Restaurants News.  http://top100.chinesemenu.com/web/?action=stars

It is rated as a TOP 100 BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT IN NORTH AMERICA. Let me repeat: IN NORTH AMERICA. This involves ALL the Chinese restaurants in Canada and the USA. 

And multiple people have the audacity to rate it one star and call it 'gross', 'awful', etc? What the f*** are you talking about?! ?!

There are some Chinese restaurants that are more accommodating to the tastes of non-Chinese people: Kings Noodle, Mother's Dumpling, etc. I can see how being served by waitresses who barely speak English can be uncomfortable. I can see how looking at the menu, not knowing what the foods taste like, and blankly ordering a few dishes may lead you to be surprised. But you being confused does not mean Ten Mile Aroma is a bad restaurant. Ten Mile Aroma is an EXCELLENT restaurant.

If you think this restaurant is bad, it is like going to the University of Toronto, taking a Calculus class, not knowing what the Professor is talking about, and blaming the University for confusing you. It is absolutely pathetic. 

Put some more effort in clarifying with the waitress in terms of what is being served to you. Have a good idea of what types of dishes you might want before you go in. Or, take a Chinese friend the next time you go there who might have an idea of what you might want and what the restaurant has to offer. I can guarantee a better experience.

Sure there are isolated incidents of being served bad food, but that happens to every restaurant. And for the people giving s*** to this restaurant for having cheap beer... WTF?!?! Isn't that supposed to be a good thing? If you are looking for some premium wine, do not go to Chinatown! Go to Chinatown if you want some authentic Chinese food! And if these tastes are too foreign to you, don't go trashing the restaurant because you will be exposed as being an ignorant person who is has no idea what they are talking about by people who actually know the cuisine.

In conclusion: Ten Mile Aroma has some really authentic Northern Chinese food. For Northern Chinese people like me, it tastes great! However, it may be foreign to the average Canadian."}
{"text":"We have been eating in this restaurant over 10 times. There's just one dish made us coming back to this restaurant -- lamp skewers (6 for $6.99). Their lamp skewers are pretty consistent, only one bad ones out of ten plus times.

Other than lamp skewers, have to talk about the cheap beer. One pitcher of light beer for 4.99, black for 5.99, where can you beat it.... And the beer taste good too....

To be honest, other than lamp skewers and beer, other stuff are pretty under average... 

The 3.5 star rating goes to the lamp skewers and beer only ..

P.s. the atmosphere is under average as well."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, authentic Chinese cuisine in a horrible atmosphere. Worst washrooms in the city. $6 beer. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap beer! $6 Pitchers. 
Dumplings and soup dumplings are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Not a real pitcher and the beer couldn't be identified by the wait staff. $5.99 for sub par light beer. Whatever it was you could get drunk on dirty beer if ya want."}
{"text":"The last few times I've gone I have been thoroughly disappointed in the quality of the food. Not sure what's going on but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I just went here for lunch with 9 other coworker, and I have to say, most of the food we try was a little bit too salty. The lamb skew was the best food, while the other food such as the fried rice, the egg plant with pork, and the soup were all \"meh\". Also the famous $5 was just as advertise, we got a few pitchers and they tasted alright ."}
{"text":"Beer's cheap and the glasses are dirty! Yelp me... Hopefully I don't get food poisoning..."}
{"text":"Unforgettable. 


I'm not really sure what to say about this place. It has got to have the worst food/service/smell I've experienced in a restaurant. It also has 4.99$ pitchers of \"Sun Draught Lager\" (note: don't try googling it, you won't find it) - canned by a \"brewer\" in Mississauga called Amber Brewery (http://amberbrewery.com/company.php). Oh, and pints are 1.75$. 

So you can see the dilemma. Apparently the cheapest beer in the city by about 50% - but everything else is just awful.

There were 12 of us dining on a Saturday evening - as we walked into the restaurant we met one of the foulest odours, as Justin H. will likely describe as \"Spicy B.O. Very spicy.\". The doors were shut, the interior was a mess, and we were seated at two tables (still drops of soy-sauce all over the table/cups). I went over and propped open the door to try and air the place out - which was somewhat successful...but the stench of the Ten Mile Aroma was still strong and stuck to the insides of our mouths.

The beer came out, we liked that. But the waitress would disappear, have to be ran down and asked to bring things like: plates, cups, water, utensils, food, etc. 

When we got her over to take our order, she stopped after 2 (of 12) and walked away. So we had to run back over and tell her we all wanted food.

The food was just....so gross. 

The people inside this place.....were a mix. Some like us: young reputable adults in search for a cheap drink and  funny experience, a small handful of Chinatown locals, and the largest segment; crazy/smelly dudes.

One patron actually was asking our group for money about two blocks away after we had left. 

Oh, 8 pitchers and food for 12 people after tax was 120$.

Bathrooms: slightly better than you'd expect. Slightly.

So - I guess this is the end of the review. It's a weird place - but one that exemplifies \"you get what you pay for\".... especially if you're interested in paying for the greasiest, cheapest, most repugnant Chinese food around."}
{"text":"For those who are looking for a pitcher of cheap mystery lager, this place is for you.
(The only reason this place gets 2 stars.)

Otherwise, there aren't many positives about this restaurant. The service, the food, the atrocious washrooms, the atmosphere and even the patrons are thoroughly sub-par.

I suggest eating elsewhere before embarking on your mission for cheap bland beer."}
{"text":"Felt sick from the grease in the dumplings.  The restaurant is quite dirty and you are not guaranteed to get what you ordered.  I asked the woman why there was chive in my seafood dumplings and she said that was their recipe.  Meanwhile there was no seafood flavour and mostly chive flavour in my dumpling.  

So my conclusion is, come here if you want to eat DUMP-lings.

I shall never return!"}
{"text":"There is one sole purpose for the college crowd that frequents Ten Mile Aroma - their really cheap pitchers of beer that are $5-6. The exact brand/type of beer is unknown by all but most people are fine with that. It's nothing strong, just a lager. What usually happens is people use this place as a pre-drinking spot since prices are comparable to the LCBO, then they head off for a night out. 

As for the food itself, I have had the steamed dumplings and it came out watery and slimy. Definitely nothing amazing. Have a feeling the other food items aren't great as well. The decor is nothing special, and the bathroom isn't exactly upscale (nor is it expected to be). But it keeps with the Chinatown ambiance, right in the heart of Spadina/Dundas (east of Spadina), not too far from Ryerson or the entertainment district."}
{"text":"Unforgettable.

I was fortunate enough to be there with @Kent P who does not suffer fools easily. A far more patient person, I, I thought, \"how bad could it be!?\"

The answer: absolutely f*cking awful.

First of all, no restaurant can completely control it's clientele, but the cheapness of beer ($1.75 for a pint, $5 pitchers) meant that those weird dudes who you see sitting despondently at empty bars - this was where they all met for dinner before heading to their respective dives. The air was think with the smell of homeless man B.O. and the sounds of drunken, slurred diatribes. We had to request that the door be opened to get a cross breeze going and help alleviate the stench of human misery.

Secondly, the service. Now, I readily acknowledge that asking someone to open the door of their restaurant because of the stink does not a good relationship make. But man alive did this waitress ever hate us. It couldn't have been less than an hour that people waited for menus and the offer of drinks. Actually, scratch that, we only got menus (3, for our table of 10) after going to the till to retrieve them. Same with ordering pitchers. regarding the beer, see Kent P.'s review touching on the mystery label. She would slam our orders down on the table as if we had somehow insulted her by asking for them. She never stuck around to see if people wanted more, which in turn meant that we were always trying to get her attention so we could complete our order, which must have made it seem like we were the most difficult table she'd ever dealt with. She would take an order from 2 people and then leave to process it before coming back. The result? Food would come out, one dish at a time, with extended intervals between arrivals. Was it the food we ordered? Oh GOD no.

Which brings me to the third issue: the food. Almost every dish was a mystery dish with the exception of a few which so thoroughly underwhelmed that many of us broke out laughing. The spicy chicken? Just deep fried chicken bits - bone still in, so buyer beware - with hot chilies sitting on the plate. Which is to say, the chicken wasn't spicy at all! It would be the equivalent of calling something breaded chicken  and then serving a chicken breast with a slice of bread beside it. Of the 10 of us, we all ordered something different as to share plates. 3 plates came out the exact same. All a noodle recipe with meats unknown. It was almost too greasy to eat and the only reason it wasn't bland was because there was enough MSG to dehydrate a camel. 

Overall it was an unbelievably bad experience. Easily the worst food, worse atmosphere and worst service I have ever, ever, EVER experienced in any restaurant, anywhere. It reminds me of a time that we went to a small restaurant in rural Mexico and ordered a meat platter, and they brought us out a plated of cold, cut up hot dogs. You're so baffled that it's even happening that it's like some Dadaist, experimental restaurant. Which is the kicker. As terrible as this place is, I have been talking about it nonstop since I went there, and I will almost definitely go back with other people to show them it. It's like the freak show of Toronto restaurants, \"see the worst food, the smelliest man, the cranky waitress! Step right up folks! You won't believe your eyes!\" 

And I promise you, it's true. You won't believe what you're seeing."}
{"text":"This place is not so commendable for its appearance of cleanliness - rather reminds me of my childhood back in China.

BUT it is the only place to find ?? downtown, AND their glass noodle with cabbage stew is heavenly. You want northern China food - you've found it here."}
{"text":"Seriously, we did not know this place offered $5 pitchers and that had nothing to do with our choice. (BTW that's $3.84615 US). So when picking a Chinese restaurant you want one that's small and owner operated and on the simple side. We maneuvered through Toronto's Chinatown and somehow picked this winner. The Yelp community doesn't seem to share the love for this place.

The menu is huge as is typical for authentic places so we asked the owner to help us out. There was a language issue so one of the locals helped us. I don't know what we ate but it satisfied our urge for traveling to Toronto's Chinatown. One was a chicken dish served on a sizzling plate which the owner was very proud of. The other was a spicy pork dish which through translation was the owners specialty.

So if ever I would be down and out in Toronto, I would panhandle some change on the street and then come here and get a whole pitcher of beer and some pretty decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Cheap, cheap, terrible atmosphere, but cheap :)

Very ugly place with dirty tables, floor and don't even think about using toilets.

Positive side is very cheap beer that taste like water, but again, cheap :)

The food is nothing special, but yet again, cheap :)

So if you are broke and have no need to satisfy any aesthetics or gourmet needs, this place is recommended."}
{"text":"I like this place. Remember the Charlie Angel's movie where they were in at a rough restaurant in Mongolia? This restaurant comes to mind. It has a lot of chunky wood furniture and a wide selection of northern Chinese dishes. The beer is cheap and the food heartifull."}
{"text":"ok so i'm pretty sure that everyone who's been to ten mile aroma has been there for one reason: the $5 pitchers. from a drinking perspective, it's a great place to go - the beer tastes like beer, is cold, and has alcohol in it. ten mile aroma gets ten miles of stars for the beer prices.

the food is very hit-and-miss. i've been here a couple of times and in my experience, any stir-fried dish just tastes very salty and soy-saucy. as in, i've tried 6 dishes off of the menu that all tasted the same (salty soy sauce eggplant, salty soy sauce beef, salty soy sauce pork, etc.). however, i have also really enjoyed the dumplings and a few of the appetizers - especially the pork pancake. the portions are very big, and they don't skimp on the meat. also, the more beer you drink, the better the food tastes.

the atmosphere is definitely lacking, unless you enjoy watching chinese news on mute and odd smells. maybe you do?

oh ya, and the service isn't great - there's only one waitress for the whole restuarant and she's not exactly the most attentive.

so basically, this place would be a 2/3-star restaurant if they didn't serve crazy cheap beer. so it's up to you to decide whether the beer is worth it - i know that i'll be going back again."}
{"text":"** This is the place for cheap food and their light draft **
Don't come here with any other expectations. You get what you paid for here.
$3.99 for 3 skewer of BBQ lamb. $6.99 for a huge dish of Beef noodle. $2.99 for 8 pieces of onion pancake. And $5.99 for the whole pitcher of Light Draft."}
{"text":"My friends warned me that they only come here for the beer. I don't drink, so while they partook in the cheap $5 pitchers I decided to be brave and try their veggie dumplings. They were completely soaked in oil and had crusted bits of stuff that had obviously been stuck to the pan from previous rounds of cooking on them. So gross. Then as my friends were on their second pitcher of beer, they went to pour a glass and a used piece of gum came out along with the beer. Again, disgusting. And don't even think about using the washroom. I wish I'd gone in there BEFORE I'd ordered the dumplings, because I certainly wouldn't have eaten anything there afterwards."}
{"text":"The pitchers were never washed and glasses are never washed by any person just dishwasher. And never order any food here. You cannot imagine how dirty in the kitchen. Some dishes are mixed by cooker's unwashed bare hands. One things need to mention. The boss never share any penny to the waiters. So top tip is never give tip!"}
{"text":"The rib is super dry, felt like it had been sitting there for days. Also a piece of metal wire was found in the dish, unacceptable!"}
{"text":"If I could have given 8 stars, I would have. How do you place rating on a transcendental, utterly out-of-body experience that brought you back to some of the sweetest and most cherished memories of your childhood - memories that you didn't even remember you had?

Having grown up in China eating Jian Bing Guo Zi and Lamb Skewers, I haven't had a good one of either in 10 years ever since I have been in the U.S. I have gone to thousands of restaurants in major cities from New York to Los Angeles but never in the past decade have I discovered food as authentic and excellent as the Jian Bing that Ten Mile Aroma offered. Each bite brought tears to my eyes -- enough said. 

The dark beer we had was delicious and cheap as well. Food was a tad on the oily side but otherwise I recommend this place by award-winning chef with both hands and feet and with my whole heart."}
{"text":"Other than the service was friendly, their food wasn't good... The veggies in mu shu pork were under cooked, mushroom chicken stew barely had mushrooms nor did the chicken have taste, and the rice wasn't that fresh (lots of clumps).

Would not come here again for Chinese dishes. If I had to come back I'll probably try their buns."}
{"text":"Eating here is really an adventure.  Now, I don't hate this place -- I actually thought the food was alright.  I don't know if this is the case because I had zero (make that negative) expectation as soon as I walked into the place.  I knew something was very wrong when I saw that there were only two tables; both had pitchers of beer and no food.  As soon as I got seated, I noticed how dirty and sticky everything is.  I immediately rolled up my mental car window up as one would when driving through a sketchy area.  The decor is amazing -- where do I even start?  They say that a great work of art grows on you, and there are new delights to be discovered every time you go back to look at it.  Apart from being a restaurant, the restaurant also acts as a shrine for the owner.  His pictures and \"awards\" are plastered all over the place, including the tables.  Above the cash register were 2 clocks right next to each other.  One was a generic round faced clock and beside it was an awesome car rim shaped one.  What more do I need to say?  Everyone deserves to experience this wonderland and discover these gems for themselves.  Just don't look at the fish tank, if all the other stuff didn't kill your appetite already, then this would definitely put a bullet in your stomach.  I was definitely wondering if this was really a restaurant or a portal that brought me to parallel universe where a place like is allowed to exist.

I ordered the spare rib noodle soup; while waiting for my food, I honestly thought I was going to take one bite then leave and eat somewhere else ... just to be nice.  I must say, I actually enjoyed it.  I've tried a bunch of places downtown for chinese noodles, and they were soggy and terrible.  The noodles were chewy, the meat didn't taste stale, and the broth was flavourful.  Excellent.  The portion was very large for it's price (4.99).  I finished the noodles happily and got the hell out of there ASAP. It was one of those situations that you're happy just to come out unharmed."}
{"text":"I cant believe I forgot to write a review for this place. Came here about a week ago and it's probably the worst food experience I've ever had in Chinatown. 

Located in the lower level, this place is dark and dingy with not many customers (reasonably so). The plates were all dirty, one of them even had a bug crawling on them. Service was extremely slow.

We orderd the:
- water cooked beef: generally supposed to be spicy and numbing, and it wasn't. On top of the lack of flavour, the beef was more like beef jerky. So hard to chew...i've never had beef like this in any chinese restaurant
- spicy stir-fried taiwanese cabbage: the only dish that i found edible. not that it was good, or spicy, but it wasn't awful
- ma po tofu: everyone else said it was edible, just not great but i didnt think it was good at all
- tien jing pork buns: lacking in flavour and the consistency of the skin was way to dense..i felt like i was eating flour
- pork rib bun with long beans: same problem with the skin, though the stuffing was very good. However, of the three buns, one of them was severely burnt and super hard. 

Honestly, I don't know why I bothered detailing the food, because really, you shouldn't even go."}
{"text":"If you're planning to bring your date to a spot for good food, this is not the place for you. But if you're planning to find a spot where you and your friends can get smashed before the club for cheap, then come on over!

Pitchers of beer here is 7$ if i'm not mistaken. You don't get  your usual branded ones like Coors, Molson, Bud, etc,,, But their craft brew beer definitely measures up!! 

The owner here is a jerk. One time I witness him dumping out half of a paid pitcher because the customers were hanging around taking up a table."}
{"text":"There should be a circle of Hell reserved for those who only pursue cheap booze. It would be covered with hand-scrawled and barely-literate signage, viciously inebriated derelicts (no less than two in this joint, and a few from our party), the pungent stank of failure (that you probably could smell from ten miles away), and all the other flourishes that are legion in Ten Mile Aroma. 

Authentic northeastern Chinese? Perhaps in that it's an incomprehensible clusterf**k in there, and everything costs pennies. But with all the amazing options in Chinatown, there is one and only one reason to visit this place. And you're damned if you do.

I am a sinner that can't resist the promise of cheap beer, let alone DANGEROUSLY cheap beer. The aforementioned Sun Draught (from the mysterious Amber Brewery) are the suds du choix in TMA, and the pricing had our entire group scratching our heads trying to suss out profit margins and the legalities of the brewing operation. Though I went for the $2 glasses, on my arrival I was greeted with two plastic-wrapped tables COVERED with $4.99 pitchers. Let me repeat: five dollar jugs. Ever feel like buying a round of pitchers? Now you can. Again and again and again.

But like the clever ironies of Hades, there is a twist. The food is subpar. The portion sizes were certainly enormous, but everything seemed greasy and that includes the plates and fistful of chopsticks they dropped on our table with all the care of a logging crane. I had a few bites of noodles that were OK, but you'd be stupid to ingest food there voluntarily.

All hope abandon, ye who want cheap beer.

Obligatory Title Pun: I would walk 500 MILES in the opposite direction.

Menu Readability: There is a fascia sign outdoors with some of the specials.

Need to mention: Sun Draught lager tastes like grass and barley and despair. Not bad, actually.

What this place teaches me about myself: That I am obviously, regrettably, and invariably a sucker for cheap alcohol. See you in cheap beer Hell."}
