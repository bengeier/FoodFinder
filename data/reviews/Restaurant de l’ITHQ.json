{"text":"Had dinner last night ,we had the tasting menu 4 courses very small portions . Not very memorable unless you consider the slow service , and not asking how we wanted the meat cooked or as sometimes it is suggested by the waiter that chef suggest this temperature. Anyway when the lamb loin came out it mostly rare to medium rare no steak knives were offered had to ask for them . Then when the plates were picked up and waiting for dessert was not offered coffee. Until afterwards. The portions were inconsistent at our table. I did notice the portions for the lower price menu were larger. Anyway  I would not go back if anyone wants to try the lower price point menu might be worth a gamble."}
{"text":"We are big fans of this hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are very nice: modern, clean, comfortable and quiet. They have really good bedside lamps and a little seating area with sofa and coffee table. Bathrooms are interior, but light is good and some have a walk-in shower. Each room has a little balcony with table and chairs. Very sweet. I recommend staying on the side of hotel NOT on Rue D'Berri, as it is quieter and overlooks the charming Rue St Denis. The breakfast used to be served by institute students, but now is buffet style and is not as good as it was a few years ago, though coffee is good and strong. We had dinner only one night and it was so-so and expensive. Location is outstanding. Have stayed here three times, all in June, July for the jazz festival. It is a 20 minute walk to the jazz festival venues around Place des Art. Right across the street is a charming Montreal park with fountain and benches--perfect for relaxing and soaking up the local scene. Park de la Fountain is a short walk away and is great for jogging and strolling and it has a nice little cafe for brunch or lunch with outdoor seating. Shopping and restaurants on Rue St Denis and surrounding streets to the west is great. All in all, this is a great deal if you are not into super lux places. Would be five stars if they still had their old breakfast service."}
{"text":"Je vais écrire en français pour la première fois car on m'a encouragée a le faire :)
L'ITHQ est une école de formation en tourisme, hôtellerie et restauration.  Je suis allée au restaurant pour le menu royal en l'honneur de la visite du Duc et de la Duchesse de Cambridge (William et Kate).  Je vous conseille de réserver d'avance car ils sont très achalandé.  Les mets étaient exquis. La seule chose qui m'a déçue était le dessert car je m'attendais a quelque chose d'extraordinaire puisque chaque mets m'impressionnait de plus en plus. Le service était bien mais pas plus. Je le trouvait un peu lent et aussi j'ai du demande 2 fois avant d'avoir le menu et de l'eau. Je trouve que pour le nombre de service et la qualité, ce n'était pas si cher compare a des restaurants semblables. J'ai hâte de revenir pour leur prochain thème!

*Update: Je suis retourné une 2e fois pour l'anniversaire de mon mari. C'est encore bien, mais encore une fois je trouve que le service devrait s'améliorer. Cette fois-ci j'ai commande des pâtes et elles n'étaient pas cuites. Ce n'était pas \"all dente\", c'était dur.  Je leur avait aussi demandé une chandelle sur le dessert, mais ils ont oublié."}
{"text":"Great experience. Room was great as was the staff. Breakfast is buffet only. Good the first day, meh the next. You could tell it was a training experience for the students when a line formed waiting for clean plates and multiple staff just walked by.

There is a great crepe place across the street: La Bulle au Carre. 

This is a good location for shipping and wandering. Square St. Louis is a lovely park."}
{"text":"Great location to stay! St. Denis is full of great resturants, bars and even some shops.  The hotel is on top of the Shrebrook metro and right up the street from the latin quarter which has more great bars and restaurants.  Much cooler than the super-touristy Vieux Montreal.

The front desk staff were very helpful and professional.  Some concerige employees were helpful others just opt to do a google search for whatever your looking for; which didn't help much when we have free wifi internet in our room.

Our room was on the 8th floor with a balcony that overlooks town. It was very neat, clean and newly renovated.  

On top of all that, it comes with a free breakfast - and not just the standard hampton inn style  \"continental breakfast\" with a lousy muffin and warm oj.  L'Institute's free breakfast featured full sit-down service with your choice of eggs, pancakes, french toast, omletts, or ceral, etc.  All in all, a great deal."}
{"text":"stayed 4 nights.  i thought the room was great especially for the price.  all staff very accommodating.  they have a terrific little buffet breakfast in the morning that made me feel like i was back in Paris.  The best part however was the fantastic way that Frank oversaw the dining room and made everyone feel so \"taken care of\"  loved his fun professional attitude!"}
{"text":"I love the Crown Bamboo bath sheets - think ultimately absorbent and light. I had to google and order some for home. The goat milk's moisturizer  and bath soap are wonderful. Room  is squeaky  clean. Waffle knit bath robes are lovely. Bed and pillows comfy. Balcony inviting and weather happened to be cooperating with rays of sunshine and some warmth.  Underground parking for a small fee (in Montreal, seriously? How great is not having to circle around trying to find parking and worrying about break ins?).  Service overall friendly and attentive. Lovely breakfast (don't miss the mini croissants).

Some minor opportunities. List ordering information for goat milk products and towels. : ) 

Crank up the strength of your breakfast coffee. Instruction on how to swipe your card on getting into room (top/down, fast/slow etc). Provide a list of TV channels and languages.  Provide some more cups for the coffee machine (and milk packs in refrigerator) . How about a bottle opener in the room? 

Overall, I am a raving fan and will return."}
{"text":"Le restaurant de l'ITHQ est unique en son genre. Nous sommes des figurants dans la salle de classe des étudiants en Hôtellerie & Restauration. 

La nourriture est cuisinée par des étudiants, le service aussi, un sommelier étudiant est disponible pour faire le pairage des vins. Le menu du midi pour 20$ est a un prix ridiculement bas pour la qualité de la nourriture. Je vous recommande le tartare de saumon il est vraiiiiiment bon ! 

Je n'ai jamais mangé le soir, mais j'aimerais tenter l'expérience.

Seul point négatif : C'est évident que tout le monde est en situation d'apprentissage, le service est donc un peu plus lent qu'ailleurs, et c'est facilement excusable étant donnée la situation ! Un peu trop lent pour ceux qui n'ont qu'une heure de lunch :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner during the MTL a table event. It was a three course meal for $31 per person. 

I've read some reviews regarding how slow their service was, but when we went there I did not feel that at all. They were very fast with our orders and bring us anything we asked for. They were also friendly and explained each dish. 

It was a very nice inside the restaurant and we enjoyed everything that day. The food was pretty good (nothing amazing but for $31 three course meal it was better than expected). Would definitely recommend as I've read that their prices were cheap even during regular days"}
{"text":"I had lunch here at the Culinary Institute and it was delightful. There is some slight apprehension during service, probably due to nerves on some of the students part and my terrible franglais =) but they put their best effort to make sure our meal was great.

I selected the scallop ceviche to start and I'm glad I did. Very fresh, the citrus flavours definitely highlighted this dish nicely.

The flank steak for my main was good. I asked for rare and it was more on the side of medium-rare, but it was still very tasty. It came with some potatoes and asparagus spears. The spicy coulis was a good accompaniment to the protein.

For dessert, I had the panna cotta and it was very nicely presented and was an excellent choice to close out a meal.

Highly recommend coming here for a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Un place avec une ambiance légère et romantique. Je l'aime beaucoup. C'est le meilleure restaurant pour un repas tranquille.  Magnifique !!!"}
{"text":"im a fan. the staff was very friendly. we were able to change one of out menus because couldn't eat some of the stuff. we also got the wine pairing and that was also very nicely done im not a very big wine person but they did a good job."}
{"text":"Une expérience gastronomique unique. C'est la deuxième fois que nous y allons et nous n'avons pas été déçus. Les plats sont beaux et excellents, le service impeccable. Nous y retournons."}
{"text":"This was our first meal on our Montreal adventure. We have tried culinary schools before and have always had great experiences. Once again, we were very impressed. We had a six course tasting menu that included perfect portions of dishes using fresh and local ingredients. Our server Julian was very good and we felt his passion for food and wine. We were able to spend time sharing our food travel experiences with one another and he taught us about some food specific to Quebec. At $57 per person, one can't skip this. The greatest cost was the bottle of wine but one must have good wine with good food. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"C'est l'endroit où sont formés les grands chefs et serveurs
On y mange et on y est servi comme dans un 5 étoiles
L'expérience en vaut la peine
Le midi, il y a un menu entrée + plat à 19.99 qui vaut vraiment la peine! Avec la possibilité de prendre un dessert pour 3 ou 4$ de plus
Parfois, il y a des plats cuisinés à l'érable
Tout est délicieux et raffiné
Je le conseille vivement!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating at this restaurant especially after eating at the CIA in NY.
The food was excellent. Everything was presented beautifully but more importantly, it tasted supreme. There were little bits of something a bit different in each course but complemented the rest of the dish. The dining experience was not as much fun as being at the CIA where you could sit and watch the kitchen. All we had here was an excellent restaurant in an elegant setting. (Overall, not a bad compromise) Comparing with the CIA, the food in both places looked beautiful and somewhat dramatic but l'ITHQ had both the looks and the taste"}
{"text":"Some odd food combinations and strange English translations, but well cooked, professionally served, and entirely approved of.  Breakfast is of lesser quality, with buffet scrambled eggs and cooked from frozen pastries, and some items (osso bucco, for example) not American diner friendly - but very good.

\"Modern\" French cuisine, with locally sourced ingredients."}
{"text":"Un véritable festival pour les papilles !! La carte change régulièrement
Pensez à réserver à l'avance !!"}
{"text":"L'Institut is a hospitality school, and its culinary students and graduates operate a gourmet restaurant that is open to the public.  The food served at the restaurant is unbelievable, and it is hard to find such exquisite food for the price anywhere else!  The service is also top notch.  The hotel is open to visitors as well and is relatively inexpensive.  I haven't stayed there but the building is very modern from the outside and very interesting.  A must see for visitors, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've hardly reviewed any hotels on Yelp.  We're not really the sort to consider a hotel a very central part of a vacation experience, because we hope we don't spend much time there and we're usually just hoping for a comfortable bed, a clean room, and peace and quiet.  Besides, we're not in a tax bracket where our choice of lodging is ordinarily going to be very noteworthy.  So in my mind, there usually isn't all that much to write about.  

Hotel de L'Institut deserves a plug, though.  It's operated by Quebec's hospitality and tourism school, so I think you get a higher-end experience for what qualifies these days as medium-level pricing in a big city.  The hotel apparently occupies only the seventh and eighth floors of L'Institut's highrise, and every room gets a balcony with an outstanding view of Le Plateau and Mont Royal on one side (or downtown, I guess, if you're on the other side).  The location is absolutely terrific:  On Rue St. Denis directly above a metro stop and across from a pretty square and within easy walking distance of a bunch of great restaurants, shopping, nightlife, et al. The rooms, while not huge, are very clean and sharp-looking and have very comfortable beds.

A night's stay here also comes with a complimentary breakfast buffet in L'Institut's restaurant.  It's a pretty impressive spread, the food is hot and quite good and seems to vary somewhat from day to day, and the service is excellent.  (This is definitely not the execrable \"free breakfast\" you get in too many hotels these days, which seem to feature Otis Spunkmeyer muffins, Little Debbie-quality pastries, and other horrible fare.)"}
{"text":"Définitivement, un gros coup de coeur pour ce restaurant--école! Un É--NOR--MÉ--MENT bon rapport qualité prix, surtout le midi. Le service est ***** étoiles et la nourriture aussi! Le décors est beau et chic, mais ce n'est pas obligatoire d'être tiré à quatre épingles pour autant. La faune est éclectique; des hommes d'affaires en complet--cravate, des étudiants- cusiniers, des retraités et des petits couples. Personnement, je fêtais l'anniversaire d'un ami.

J'ai pris une mousse de poisson en entrée, une truite des Bobines en plat principal et une salade de fruits. 
Tout est bien présenté avec soin et les produits sont locaux. La mousse était bien crémeuse et servie avec deux salades croquantes. La truite était accompagnée de légumes racines colorés et vitaminés et d'une sauce bien goûteuse. Quant à la salade de fruits, elle était rafraîchissante et pas trop sucrée, avec une mousse au fruit de la passion qui équilibrait le tout avec son petit côté acidulée. J'ai terminé ce festin avec un espresso allongé, gentiment servi avec un mini--biscuit! Quelle belle attention! Je n'ai pas bu d'alcool, car je partais travailler tout de suite après. Par contre, il y a un bon choix de vin au verre et à la bouteille. Demandez conseil à votre serveur si vous êtes indécis! 

Excellent endroit pour impressionner une nouvelle flamme sans vous ruiner! Réservations obligatoires, car le nombre de place est limité!"}
{"text":"Was here for the complimentary breakfast as we stayed at the Hotel. The waiter was always very polite and courteous. He also helped us with an embarrassing situation. We thought we needed the hotel access card to open the door and kept swiping it. He helped us out by....opening the door!!! OMG so sad lol

Anyhow, breakfast was always nice here. It was so beautiful and bright with the open windows. We got served with either coffee or your choice of orange or grapefruit? juice. There were scrambled eggs (eggs were plain but you can add your own salt/pepper), sausage, vegetables, lots of bread, salmon, ham, fruits, etc. My favourite were the croissants and DIY parfait station. I could eat here everyday for breakfast. It helped save on food on the trip as we ate so much for breakfast that we only needed dinner."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible. The service was horrific! I highly recommend moving on considering there are so many other fantastic restaurants nearby"}
{"text":"Délicieux ! C'était ma première fois au restaurant de l'institut pour manger le soir, j'y suis aller dans le cadre du nouveau festival MTL à TABLE. Un menu 3 services à 29$, belles présentations, plats gouteux, bon service, je vous suggère d'y aller avant que MTL à TABLE se termine le 11 novembre. Bravo à l'ITHQ ainsi qu'à Tourisme Montréal pour l'initiative !"}
{"text":"If you feel like having a 5 star lunch on a 20-30$ then you should definitely visit the schools restaurant on the top floor.
The food is prepared by the students and it is AMAZING. They seriously go out of their way to impress the guests and I assume that it's part of their final exam. The prices for table d'hôte are extremely low (we're talking 11-14$) and you get a nice multi course meal.

There are few things to keep in mind:

- The restaurant upstairs is only open from Monday to Friday (don't confuse it with the downstairs restaurant)
- If you're paying by credit card/debit card you will not be able to tip (the students cannot accept tips). However, the service is almost always excellent so if you feel like leaving a tip, you can do it in cash.
- Sometimes on Fridays you may want to book a table in advance because the large group of ladies and gentlemen from a retirement home nearby come to lunch on Fridays."}
{"text":"The food is superb. The restaurant and hotel is staffed by students. So the service can range from superb to tentative and clumsy. If you don't mind the occasional awkward (yet endearing) moment during your meal, it's well worth a visit. The staff are so earnest that it makes up for any mistakes they make."}
{"text":"Amazing food but extremely slow service. I would recommend arriving at least 45 min before you get hungry. Ps: if the lower price tag for fancy food is what brings your here, try the bar side of Laloux as well (they have 2 appetizers+ dessert for $25 only)."}
{"text":"Magnificent restaurant for a very good price. Did the standard 5 course meal with a couple drinks for only $75 CAD per person after tax and tip. The food was exquisite and had some of the best steak I've ever had. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Magnifique decor vitré et boisé avec sa grande fenestration et petites lumieres. Atmosphere tres tranquile. L'avantage ici c'est des prix accessibles pour repas gastronomiques preparé et servi par des etudiant finissants."}
{"text":"I reserved two weeks ago to eat at the Institute.  Was very excited to go there for their three course meal for $35.  
We first walked in it was no maître d' or host.  
After about five minutes a waiter came and showed us to a table.
It took about 10 minutes to get a glass of water.  
After we each ordered our two courses I was presented with what was supposed to be a foie gras appetizer with a Gelee- and was served a sweet based cream with tasted like it was a pork pate.  Although it was pretty to look at it wasn't very tasty.   My 18-year-old son  commented that it didn't taste like anything it tasted like the bread.    
Well I figured that the entrées certainly must  be better-
I ordered the lobster and it came as a plain small tail and claw- on a bed of plain disgusting seaweed.  The lobster meat was tough it was not edible- I sent it back and maître d' apologized and said well once in a while we get a tough lobster.  However it wasn't just the lobster it was whatever was accompanying it it was awful. If I would've eaten it probably would be sick. 
My husband and my son ordered the pork piglet three ways- tiny amounts of food that were not cooked as well as I could've cooked it at home.   The pork belly was full of fat and half of it was left on the plate not edible.  
As for the service there was one waiter and one back waiter for the entire restaurant. 
Service was very slow.  
I understand that this is a school and that students are probably cooking the food.  And that's fine because I have eaten at cooking schools before- such as the New England Institute of culinary arts- and the New York school of the Culinary arts.  
This restaurant is more like a bad dream. I would highly recommend not going and if you do go perhaps just go for breakfast. 
Dessert sat on the tray all evening it was some sort of tasteless bland pudding like what you may get on a cruise ship.  As a matter fact I would definitely say Carnival Cruise Lines has better food then l' Institute.  
Yes you heard right carnival cruise lines.  
I don't care about overly pretentious food and restaurants , the bottom line is you have good food or you don't.  
If you're reading this perhaps you can get a reservation at Au pied du Cochon - or the wonderful l' express a few blocks down on St. Denis.  
Such a total disappointment- sadness on a plate."}
