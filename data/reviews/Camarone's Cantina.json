{"text":"I think I just puked in my mouth... Horrible! Food & service quality left with Gardunios.."}
{"text":"The Good: 
Despite what others have said, I loved the decor. The horses were and the architecture were very nice. The food had good taste. 

The Bad: 
The service was very sub-par. Both the hostess and our waiter acted like they didn't want to be there. Service was very slow. I had fajitas and not only were they not sizzling, but weren't even hot. My girlfriend's plate wasn't even warm when our food was served."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a movie...We found the decor to be quite interesting.
I really loved the chicken soup with green chili. 
Hubby had the tortilla soup- that was much heavier. 
I generally rate a mexican place by the taste of their house margarita and their fajitas. We had to pass on the margaritas tonight, but we split the combo fajitas with steak and chicken. I would definitely come back for the steak fajitas. I'm also a sucker for sopaipillas and figure any place that can surprise me with a basket of them...is definitely a place I will return to."}
{"text":"I have grown up on Garduno's and loved it.. Went to Camarone's back in May after the name change and food was definately NOT the same.. Very very disappointed with the quality and taste of the food!! will NOT be going back and will have to stick to Garduno's at the Palms in Vegas or the chain in ABQ."}
{"text":"Holy crap...  I don't know where to begin.  From the theme park decor to the menu that appeared to be cut and pasted together by a three year old and the poor execution of the food, this restaurant is confusing at best.

The moment you walk into this place it's visually overwhelming and discouraging.  The Corinthian topped Egyptian pillars are a strange sight and the giant metal horses hanging from the ceiling appear to be running full speed for the exit.  The holes blasted into plaster partitions and the extras from the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom set really  give the place a ghastly atmosphere.  There's so much going on inside it's difficult to try and just relax, you constantly feel as if some guy in a costume is about to jump out and scare you.

Decor aside, the people in charge clearly had no idea how to design a menu.  It seemed as if all the sections were written out and then jumbled up.  But such disorganization is to be expected judging from the decor.  The menu selection was also puzzling.  With dishes ranging from traditional southwestern cuisine, Norwegian Salmon, unappealing pastas and a hamburger, my confidence in the cooks to prepare all the dishes well was shot.

I ordered a fillet and stuffed shrimp, one of the pricier items and different from what the others in my group were ordering (they stuck to the tacos, chimichangas, etc...).  I also ordered a tortilla soup for my starter and it resembled a tortilla salad more than a soup.  There was almost no liquid in the bowl I received and what little there was, was absorbed by the pile of shredded tortillas.  The flavors were somewhat there, but it definitely needed to be more of a soup.  The main plate I was served look like someone just slopped on some gooey mashed potatoes, sneezed out some shards of squash and coughed up a few, puny  bacon wrapped shrimp.  Now, I would like to mention again that the menu stated STUFFED shrimp.  The steak was over cooked and under seasoned, the shrimp had some burnt spots and the overall dish was barely room temperature.  The tacos were barely passable, the chicken stuffed sopapilla was lacking, and the enchiladas needed some more cooking.  After we ate we were given sopapillas, which appeared okay.  They looked nice and fluffy, golden and crunchy, but once I put it into my mouth it melted into a bland, doughy mass that was difficult to swallow.

All the negativity aside there were a couple of good points that need mentioning.  The salsa had a good heat level and the chips were good.  The service was good and the people were friendly and kept a good eye on us.  The pesole soup was good and the rice and beans were acceptable.

Overall, I would say this restaurant needs some serious work and I would give it a barely passing grade.  If they could just focus, this restaurant would outshine many others."}
{"text":"Attended a gathering here with heavy appetizers. Food okay. The service was less than fair. May try again...or not!"}
{"text":"Got taken here for a business dinner, and it wasn't half bad.  The decor is somewhat frightening.  If you are a 6-year old girl or a jockey, you will find the floating horse statues and horse pictures all over the wall quite lovely.  Personally, I started having flashbacks to the Mr Hands internet video from a few years back.

The bar seems to offer the standard domestics and Mexican beers you get at everywhere Mexican restaurant.  The salsa that comes with the chips was incredibly good.  It was quite smokey, which isn't something I run into very much back home.  Not a lot of chunks, but the smokey Chipotle flavor really carries it.

I ordered a pork burrito.  The meat tasted great, but everything else on the plate was fairly standard.  The free sopapillas are a nice addition at the end of the meal.  Overall, this place does some pluses, but nothing that would make me want to go back over any other standard Mexican place that seems to exist in every city."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to Garduno's restaurant, only to find out they were now Camarone's Cantina.  

I had been to Garduno's in Albuquerque and LOVED IT... when it arrived in Scottsdale on Scottsdale Road-- I was soo excited!  I was crazy about the trio enchilada plate and the amazing margaritas.

Well... went inside Camarone's with an open mind... and left feeling nauseous.   Their shredded beef chimichanga was so full of fat and had a weird strange taste-- like it was cooked in chicken soup (??)

I wouldn't go back for anything..."}
{"text":"I agree with Joe H.  Nothing special enough to make me want to return here.  And it is always a clue when the restaurant likely holds a couple of hundred people but is empty.

To their credit, my mother really enjoyed the fish.  I had fish tacos, which were absolutely average.

Service?  Average.

Atmosphere?  They should have put all that cash into paying the Executive Chef."}
{"text":"Matt and I stopped here on our first day in AZ. October was Customer appreciation month with drink and lunch/dinner specials every day. We sat on the patio. I had a margarita which was delicious and Matt took advantage of the Dos Equis special. We shared the grilled fish taco's which were huge and over flowing. We also had the cheese enchiladas to share. It was way to much food even for the 2 of us. Of course we did fill up on 2 bowls of home made chips and salsa before the food arrived! Service was very good as we were only 1 of 3 tables in the whole place.  I would most certainly go back."}
{"text":"After trying on new jeans down the way.. my group was in the mood for Mexican food.. UGH! NOOO! Ive got Hudson jeans I must fit in to! I love the decor.. The staff was friendly.. The food.. was, so so.. I found the chips on the greasy.. as in.. greasy fingers side.. The salsa was great.. and my enchiladas were nothing amazing.. almost watery. I dont think its nice to have to ask for app plates for my chips and salsa.. but we had to, because I thot it was ridiculous to be using napkins! 
Our waiter seemed off kilter when asked to split the check.. oh well.. so-so.. is a 2 too.."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is nice.  Looks like it was a brewery at some point.  The shredded beef is awesome but stay away from the Tortilla soup."}
{"text":"Was in town recently and looking for a place to eat, the decor was very nice but some things did put off a weird vibe. We sat at the bar and got excellent service from the bartender.

The food wasn't amazing but it was good and I liked that they accommodated my weird food request (vegetables instead of rice). I had the fish tacos and they really could have doubled up on the fish."}
{"text":"Happy hour here did the job.  It wasn't anything amazing but our group was having trouble deciding.  We ordered rolled tacos, the sampler platter and chili cheese dip. The chili cheese dip was actually the highlight, made with green chilis and real cheese. Unfortunately their tableside guacamole and any of the seafood appetizers, like ceviche, are not included in happy hour prices.  We had six drinks total between the four of us, although my friend's fruit margarita didn't taste like it had any tequila.  For all the food and drinks we got away with only spending $40 for the four of us."}
{"text":"I thought the food was ok. Not amazing. My girlfriend did not like the upstairs bathroom one bit! She did like the horses on the ceiling though. I really liked the tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Wow. All I can say was this place is amazing. I took a few friends from out of town here and they LOVED it. The music was great, and the food was excellent.  Everything was top notch. The hostesses were gorgeous and very gracious. They just looked so happy to see everyone that walked in. They're smiles made me feel so welcome; beautiful presence. The service was tremendous. The food came out so speedy it was amazing. The only thing that I have to say is that the mariachis are a tad loud when you want to have a quite conversation, but they only come on Friday's and Saturday's. Other than that, this restaurant was absolutely wonderful, and I will definitely be back for some Authentic Mexican Cuisine."}
{"text":"This place was formerly known as Garduno's - other than the name nothing seems to have changed.

The ambience is striking and very nice.  The food is very basic and not that good.  The only thing which stands out are the free sopapillas with honey which they serve at the end of the meal.
The margaritas were not good, very watered down and barely a dash of salt on the glass even when requested.  Their top shelf rita tasted ok and the grand sized rita was like lemonade in a jug.

I'm sure there are better places to have mexican food in the area..."}
{"text":"Stayed down the street at the Hyatt and needed something easy for dinner.  I wasn't expecting much and that is exactly what I got.  The food was ok, the atmosphere was weird, and the service was decent.  

The restaurant is huge and really doesn't create a great atmosphere when there are only 15 people in the entire place.

I'd say skip it!"}
