{"text":"Even though I haven't ordered food at any of these kiosks, I admire the vendors for staking out a claim and squatting on this underused piece of concrete next to Scadding Court Community Centre at Dundas and Bathurst. Since the vendors are so varied, each one should be considered on its own merit but overall, this is a civic social experiment that should be applauded and emulated. Food trucks took notice and camped out, and I did have a ruben rollup from Caplansky's food truck which was unique and hit my tastebuds with a welcome dose of vinegar in the sauerkraut on that hot August day after a swim in the oversize Alex Park Pool nearby. The latest vendor I'm aware of was a Filipino street food addition specializing in all those 'variety' meats that you could only dare each other to eat, gross, yet awe-inspiring. If you notice a crowd around this market as you speed around the dogleg curve on Dundas, or ride by on the streetcar by, do pull off and check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Another failed street food experience.  I really love the idea of Market 707 but they have to realize that in order for them to survive they have to up the taste factor.  I was sorely disappointed with my order of tostones (fried plantain) with pulled pork.  The plantain was doughy and tough and the pulled pork had to much vinegar in the dressing leeching the lovely fatty taste this dish could have had.  I understand that it is cheap but I could have really done better elsewhere.  I did not get a lot of food for the money I spent.  These is the second time that I tried another food stall at this place and I don't think I will try a third time, whether I am charmed or not."}
{"text":"A microcosm of food and life, housed in converted shipping containers: it may be messy and loud at times, but there's always wonderful surprises that you can find if you only look.  A Caribbean drink made from tree bark, a Filipino dessert called halo halo, French amarena cherry macaroons, Columbian patacon pisao, meat pies from Zimbabwe: you can travel the world with your taste buds all along one small block! All the vendors are welcoming and warm; they greet you with smiles and offer free samples. It's better to tour Market 707 during the warm months when all of the vendors are open and outdoor seating is available. Washrooms available at the community center or library. Go early and bring a hat or wear sunscreen.   NOTE: make sure to check their site for current vendors http://www.scaddingcourt.org/market_707_vendors/"}
