{"text":"One of our favorite spots! The food is impeccable, the service is friendly and attentive. Menus change based on the season, and the taste is authentically Italian. With a unique charm and a cozy dining room (make a reservation!), you are guaranteed a quiet ambiance to enjoy a special meal out - and if you can hit the patio during the summer - even better. We bring our out-of-town family here every chance we get. The wine selection is top notch; the house-made gnocchi and honey-butter brussels are my fav; and you can finish every meal with a perfect cappuccino - what could be better?"}
{"text":"Il Bosco has exactly the ambiance one should expect for a small elegant restaurant in downtown Davidson.  The service was excellent.   They have a strong wine list and were helpful with recommendations.  Around our table we enjoyed Cesare salads (dressing was a little sweet, not sure if I agreed with that), caprese, veal saltinbocca, flounder and fliet mignon specials, cannelloni, and cheesecake.  Every item earned a rave review."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service, very friendly owner and waitstaff. I definitely will be back! Best place for dinner around here for sure! The charcuterie is amazing! Would love vin santo added to the options for after dinner drinks."}
{"text":"I'm confident to say this is the most fantastic Italian restaurant in the Charlotte metro area. Its small, and quaint so you should absolutely make a reservation.  The people complaining about the attire and showing up on a Friday without a reservation?  Get real.   The food is absolutely fantastic. I went with a large party and got to sample almost everything on the menu. The standouts were the broccoli rabe and sausage pasta and the veal scallopini. I do not often give 5 stars, but Il Bosco is completely deserving."}
{"text":"Pros - The fresh bread and tuscan white beans in oil at the start are so delicious. We had the Pollo Paese and the Vitello Saltimbocca then split a small pasta as a side.  Both the veal and chicken dishes were a good portion size.  Also, there are sides that may be ordered but a pasta side dish isn't one of the options, wish it was.  I chose three cookies for desert, which were all very good.  Excellent wine as well.  Overall, all of our food was delicious and I will return.  Cons - Could stand to dial down the snobby factor a bit. We sat out back on the patio and I noticed a sign on the door stating proper attire is required - no flip flops.  Now don't get me wrong I understand to maintain a more upscale restaurant certain standards need to be maintained, but if I can wear the exact same thing I had on to Del Frisco's give me a break.  So, I specifically ask if would have been allowed to sit inside.  The server said no because the owner didn't allow flip flops.  Despite the fact I was dressed neatly and nicely I was wearing rainbows, so no inside seating for me.  Not sure if it was more the waitress or if the owner would have actually had an issue."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with nice ambiance  Menu was typical for an upscale Italian establishment serving regional dishes and overall our initial impression were very favorable. Our waiter at first seemed very attentive and knowledgeable; however, it turned out to be a guise for a very condescending demeanor.  My wife asked if the chef could hold the olives on her swordfish and he became very dismissive.  Our friends ordered the gnocchi with bolognese sauce.  When he asked how the dinner was I stated that although the gnocchi was good, the sauce had no meat!  He ied to lecture me that it had thick beef sauce, to which we differed.  He was even clueless that most bolognese has veal, beef and pork.  My soft shell crabs were excellent  Wifes swordfish was fair; gnocchi  good, but sauce poor.  In general, food overpriced and small portioned."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come here every time we are in the mood for some fancy cuisine. I love the atmosphere, the service, and especially the food. We always order a pasta dish which never disappoints. The restaurant is a quiet environment perfect for a date night or for a group gathering. The desserts served are also amazing. The Chocolate Ganache is desert heaven. I would most definately recommend this to friends and family."}
{"text":"I make it a point to go to Il Bosco every time I am in North Carolina as I have never been disappointed, regardless of what I have tried there. Besides the excellent food, the ambiance makes it a perfect place for date night though they can accommodate larger groups as well! I just wished I lived closer. Though I would drive a fair distance to eat here, Arizona is a bit far. :)"}
{"text":"The food is great, and I love their option for half-size entrees. I've been there four or five times now, but the most recent visit consisted of really poor service, and previous visits have never exceeded expectations (or even met them) in terms of service.  My husband and I arrived without reservations on a Monday or Tuesday to a mostly-empty dining room, and were treated very poorly. We were told first by an abrupt server that there would be a wait, which we agreed with, and sat at the bar. Three people came into the bar to pour a drink, print a check or enter an order and not one greeted us, offered a drink menu or a drink.   The owner eventually came over, reminded us there would be a 15-20 minute wait, and asked us if we would be staying. We told him we would stay (at this point felt we were unwanted dinner guests). I also asked for a wine list. He handed it to me and left.   Several minutes later, I flagged down a server and ordered my wine. My husband was upset and wanted to leave at this point, but it was my birthday and I wanted pasta so we stayed... after that, the meal was good (as I said, the food is great).   If they could make guests feel special or improve their communication, I would come there all the time. Even just letting people know that their chef can only handle X tables at a time would be great. (actually, they should just have a smaller restaurant).   Since then, I've suggested we go there a couple of times (I'm a pasta fan) and my husband always turns it down in favor of another restaurant in the area because he doesn't want to support the owner who would treat guests in that manner."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable meal at Il Bosco - it was a special occasion for us and the restaurant did not disappoint. Friendly and attentive personal service from the staff and the owner/manager, along with tasty food. The fritto misto antipasto was fresh and crispy; gnocchi al boscaiola was tasty and the special Costoletta Di Maiale Capricciosa was superb. Finished with an orange semifreddo and a nice conversation with the server and owner. I would recommended Il Bosco for a special meal. Nice wine list, too - enjoyed a bottle of 2009 Il Mozza Morellino di Scansano. Grazie per una cena deliziosa - tanti auguri!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were taken to Il Bosco after a business meeting in the Mooresville area. What a treat. Ambient and elegant, with delicious food and top-notch service to match. I can't speak for my colleague, but my caprese salad (heirloom green tomato!) and gnocchi were superb; flavorful without being too oily or saucy. I particularly liked the chocolate ganache and tiramisu at the end of the meal. The owner was kind enough to send our table complimentary sparkling wine which paired very well with both desserts and altered the flavor of the wines."}
{"text":"We were so hopeful for the possibilities -- an upscale Italian restaurant with small-town warmth and charm. We were sadly disappointed. The food was decent -- poor gnocchi but very good mussels appetizer. But the service was extremely unprofessional... most  centrally at the hostess station (which we were seated five feet away from despite having reservations and literally being the only people in the restaurant when we sat). One staff member didn't get up from her seat at the bar when we entered, and we stood for a few minutes at the entrance before she turned around and said \"just walk back there...\" Then as we ate, we watched as they turned drop-ins away, told another walk-in he had could sit but had to be out in an hour. Even at the end of our evening, the place was still barely half filled. It appeared they were trying to create a perception of exclusivity, but instead it just came off snotty. And the food certainly didn't back up the attitude. If you're looking for a nice dinner in Davidson, try Flatiron or even Brickhouse. For Italian, Campania in Cornelius has better food without the attitude."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place of mine when I visit North Carolina, the staff is friendly and the ambience is relaxing and the food is wonderful. A great date night or even family night out. My daughters enjoyed it and that is all worth it for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our Anniversary dinner here recently and it was a wonderful dining experience.   We promised ourselves that we will treat ourselves to this amazing Italian food more often.   The best Italian in the South."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant where I met the guy I will probably end up with in my life...:) It is small and romantic, intimate...The staff there are all very kind and customer service minded.  The food was very good-but I am glad that they have added more choices to their menu.  Good wine-everything fresh and very good."}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience.  Went with my parents for my dad's birthday, and we all loved our meals. The bread was fresh, warm, and crunchy, I had the spinach salad special with fried goat cheese (yum!) and mom had their basic salad.  She got the salmon special with a lemon butter sauce that was fantastic!  Dad got the veal saltimbocca with prosciutto, and I got the chicken paese.  That was unusual (chunks of chicken in a heavy and semi-dark lemony sauce with artichokes and rosemary) but still tasty.  The only disappointment was the strawberry tart, which was too heavy on the crust and not enough fruit, but I've had a lot of French-style tarts like that, so maybe it's just me.  Overall, definitely an improvement over the previous restaurant, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"This place didn't want business. When we got there they told us \"if\" we ate there we would have to sit at the front of the restaurant. The place is not that big and the back half had a table of 12 and 2 four top tables.  Sitting up front wasn't a problem, but the attitude of the hostess was.  We said it would be fine to sit up front.  She then said she would have to check with the manager.  He came over and said it would be a hour wait for them to cook the food.  Not a hour wait for the table, a hour wait after we ordered. When I looked at him he said he had the large party (of 12) that was going to back the kitchen up.   So we went down the street to Campania and had a great meal."}
{"text":"Food was very good but did not offer Veal Saltimbocca and that is what we searched for specifically on Yelp"}
{"text":"My husband and I were referred to Il Bosco by a local shop owner. Unfortunately, we didn't make it there until our last night in the area. Everything was delicious. I had a small salad, which was fine. My husband ordered a special salad with gorgonzola, artichokes, and pork, and it was delicious. He also ordered a chicken dish made with mushrooms, rosemary, pork cheeks, and it was light, delicious, and perfectly sauced.  Our only complaint was that we didn't get a chance to try Il Bosco for lunch."}
{"text":"I love the cozy atmosphere of this nice Italian restaurant.  Everything we ordered was outstanding . . . and fresh!  For my main meal I had the butternut squash gnocchi that was superb.  The owner was very nice and the service very professional.    On a weekend you might want to call ahead for a reservation.  Can't wait to go back and next time were going to take friends."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I had a wonderful evening at Il Bosco, open since February, smack in the middle of Davidson, NC, a tiny hamlet adjacent to one of the premier liberal arts colleges in the US. The fact that Davidson is small has likely been the cause of its lack of high-end fine dining restaurants over the years, but as Lake Norman and Charlotte have grown into the Davidson community's economy, it is time for a restaurant such as Il Bosco.  The fresh bread offered at the beginning was warm, with a soft interior and crisp, slightly salty crust, and perfect for the white beans served alongside in a fine, light olive oil. Classic Tuscan.  We ordered two apps (antipasti) - grilled vegetables on some delicious mozzarella and arugula on one plate, and a well-chosen set of salumi on another, with great olives, all at their most tender and flavorful and at room temperature, showing the kitchen's sensitivity to their plates. Our wine was a very good Barbera d'Alba, which was made with a bit of Western wine style, but ultimately a good choice for our primi piatti. Before the primi piatti arrived, though, we had small pasta plates: Angela ordered the gnocchi with a great slow-cooked beef in a ragu sauce, and I ordered a piccolo size of penne with pesto, topped with perfectly toasted pine nuts.   To the primi piatti: Angela ordered the osso buco and I ordered the bone-in pork chop with an agrodolce topping with an accompanying white wine sauce. Angela's osso buco was slightly underseasoned, and the polenta cakes a bit oversalty. If you ate them together in one bite (which is not the way they were presented), they were quite excellent. The osso buco was falling off the bone - another sign that the kitchen was truly smart about Italian food. My pork chop was the hit, however, with the right acidity and sweetness in the agrodolce and a nice, slow-cooked chop with plenty of moisture still in the meat, a sign of a restrained hand that knows how to gauge temperature when doing such chops.   The dessert was a dense flourless chocolate cake, made by Joe, who also had done Angela's pillow-soft gnocchi. It was perfect, with the right choice of high-quality chocolate, a lovely creamy mouth-feel, and a perfect Remy Martin on the side to ease it onto the palate.   Service was congenial and efficient, with team service (Joe was food runner). Our waitress was also the bartender - for a bar that looks very inviting, situated next to a lounge that looked very comfortable for enjoying a drink and conversation before or after dinner.   All in all, this is a place that competes well with restaurants in any major city on the Eastern seaboard.   Truly worth the visit."}
{"text":"Dining out a few time a week for decades, usually in search of fine cuisine, led me to this yelp comment.  Out of hundreds of restaurants I have eaten in, this is one of the few I will comment on including the many I have eaten in NY. For the most part, high end service and quality food seems to be a thing of the past because no one knows how to do it anymore! But, for me, that is what I am still looking for. I can eat casually at McDonalds. I don't need that kind of prepackaged food when I go out to dinner. And that 's what you get most of the time.  So, on my brother's recommendation, I drove 5 hours to see relatives and dine at Il Bosco. My brother Joe ran one of New York's most famous Italian restaurants until 2003. Since then I have been on a journey for exceptional food and service, along with atmosphere. This place is it!  We purposely stay away from restaurants owned by people we know because it is so embarrassing to not return again after a disappointing meal. So, I was not eager to go to Jimmy and Ann's Il Bosco Ristorante for that reason. But, Joe insisted. I am so glad I did. How can I now stay away?  My sister, who was chef/owner of a famous LI French Restaurant, dined with me tonight and was equally charmed by the entire experience. First, when you go to an Italian Restaurant, don't you want the owner/chef to be Italian? I do! They are!  Secondly, don't you want to enter the world of Italy as you enter the doors?  Outside the front door we could already feel the warm Italian ciao! when the ethnic music beckoned us in. We saw the enchanting patio reminiscent of Italian homes, then entered. How delightful to see immaculate cleanliness and sparkle everywhere. That tells you about the condition of the food you will be eating. Attention to detail presents glasses without smudges and a floor without a spot, despite the crowd.  But, watch Jimmy as he walks around doing what any proud host should be doing. He makes sure everything is perfect! He may even pour your water for you. Why should the owner do that? Because he cares about his guests.  And perfection is the name of the game in this restaurant!    I can't discuss the individual delights we feasted on, so just go in and experience it yourself. Authentic Italian bread, not Americana rolls or French bread.  Mozzarella like you never had before, etc. etc. etc.  Try the Brandied Cherry Cream Cake created by Jimmy's son.  Furthermore, the best restaurants in the world are family owned and run with a pride that is only found in la famiglia. By the way, Jimmy loves to tell stories while you dine. Just ask!  He's got a million of them! The waiters and waitresses are polished and daughter-in-law Tarra is a delight. Ann will make you feel like you are in her home with her warmth and hospitality. Listen, Just go and be happy that elegant dining is still alive and well in NC. Thanks and kudos to the Hermann Family!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent waitstaff, very accomadating.  The meal was excellent and wine list was nice.  Highly recommended and we will return soon."}
{"text":"The pasta was very good, service very good, wine menu very good however anything cooked on the grill was burned! Our bread, chicken, and panini dishes were burnt.   Fettucine with ham/peas was delicious. One good dish out of four? Come on!  We even looked around at the other tables and saw burnt bread too! We brought burnt bread to servers attention and her remarks were, \" It's the grill\" No kidding. The server did not return except to bring our check. Unfortunately, server was manager and no help. Just so you know. We will take our money elsewhere. There are better dining options in Lake Norman area. Beth Davenport"}
{"text":"What a lovely dinner! A colleague and I dined here and remarked that every single dish ranegd frvery good to exquisite. The pear almond tart at the end was excellent- beautifully prepared and not too sweet. The grilled octopus salad was one of the best I've ever had, and the veal Marsala was incredible. This was some of the best Italian food I've had in a long time, and the family-owned atmosphere is sweet. I can't wait to come back in warm weather and try out the patio."}
{"text":"This is the best lunch spot in town, even with the newer ( and pricier) additions. Sandwiches and lunch-sized pasta dishes are excellent (I have eaten many). I have eaten here more than a dozen times and never experienced poor service. On the contrary the family- run operation has tons of regulars. Gnocchi are absolutely delicious, as is the pesto chicken sandwich and the parsnip fries. Yum. I do wish their lunch salads were more of an entree size."}
{"text":"Loved the food and wine selection, but could have passed on the attitudes and snobeness. Excuse me if I didn't make a reservation, we decided last moment and arrived before 6 on a friday evening, so it didn't seem necessary anyway. It seemed like we were inconveniencing them more then anything. It was my birthday dinner and was hoping for a nice relaxing dinner with my family, but instead I felt like I was being treated like a second class citizen. They need lessons on customer service. Maybe the whole staff should take a field trip to Caruso's in Mooresville, they just may learn something about people skills and making the customer feel special!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service here. My favorite thing was the gnocchi. The veal was very good as well.   And I like the perceived snobbiness here.. Why should a place with a higher standard be punished? I mean if you drove all the way to Davidson, you shouldn't have to be bothered to dress properly should you?"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here on Saturday night with some friends and loved it. We've had a hard time finding good Italian food since moving here from NJ - and this was as good as it gets. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and great food especially the dessert.  The portions for some meals can be small but the sides are nice."}
{"text":"Consistently fabulous and creative. You absolutely cannot go wrong here with a chef that is always in perfect form. We have been here many many times and have never had anything but a delightful experience and a delicious meal. And to top it all, it is quiet enough to have an intimate conversation."}
{"text":"You walk in and, in that same second, you feel totally transformed. As far as restaurants in the Carolina's, this one is the very real deal. Picture yourself stepping into a beautiful restaurant in a beach or mountain resort town in Italy. The people there make you feel at home and they are so giving. The food and the service are incredible and once you go you'll get to have this same experience for yourself."}
{"text":"After hearing about this restaurant for awhile, finally checked it out with friends the other night. It was a really great experience ... Very good service, nice atmosphere and fantastic food. Reasonably priced, too. This place is off of Main Street, but I definitely recommend finding it and trying it ..."}
{"text":"Thank you for the food tonight. We really enjoyed the nice appetizer and mussel pasta. The waitress is also very nice and helpful. Thank you?We love here and I will definitely recommend this resturant to my friends."}
{"text":"If you've never eaten in a top notch Italian restaurant I could  see why this is a 5 star. I've read other reviews of bad service and bad attitude. We had a great experience and good service. The young lady that was acting as the head server was wonderful. She took our order, suggested a wine, and made sure throughout the dinner we were happy. It's a very impressive little, intimate place. I do like the atmosphere. The most important thing, obviously is the food. Reading the menu the variety was impressive and different from the regular Italian restaurants. Unfortunately the food missed on flavor. Everything seemed quite bland. It seamed like there was one thing left out of most of the dishes. The only thing that had a lot of flavor seemed to be the Caesar salad. I couldn't eat it all, because it was actually over powering."}
{"text":"21st Wedding anniversary and my wife wanted a nice Italian Restaurant. Went through the local list and decided on Il Bosco in Davidson. We've dined here before but for some reason, it's been a long time since we were here. Happy to report that it is still as good as it was a couple or years ago.  It's on a short street called Depot street with on street parking but also a parking lot is available behind the building. If you park there, you end up coming in the back door  but we were lucky in that we had early reservations (5:30 pm) so we were able to park almost at the front door. Came in handy when we left,  because a thunderstorm with heavy rains came through and our car was only 10 feet away.  When we walked in, we were given a choice of dining inside or out on the patio. The temperature was only in the 60's and it was pleasant so for a change we chose to sit on the patio. The bougainvilleas in hanging baskets along with a hugh rose were both in bloom and were beautiful.  Our server was excellent and for that matter, so was the rest of the staff. He took our drink orders and while they don't have tea on Saturdays, everything else was great. I ended up with Pellegrino which was fine.  I started with a Caprese appetizer which was excellent. Don't know where they found the tomatoes but these were nice and fresh and did not taste like cardboard which is how most tomatoes taste this time of year. The Balsamic on top was a very high quality as well.  My wife ordered Veal Piccata and added a side of asparagus that she proclaimed to be some of the best Piccata she had experienced. I order the pan seared Duck Breast with Sun chokes and applesauce.  The Duck was excellent. It's very easy to overcook Duck and if not prepared properly, Duck can be somewhat greasy.  This Duck was cooked to a perfect medium rare, moist and juicy and without the least hint of greasiness.   In the area, presentation or plating is almost a lost art but in this case, the plating  was very attractive and appealing.  Toward the end of dinner, the thunderstorm came up and the owner and staff moved everyone in a well orchestrated manner.  It was inside that my wife and I had our deserts. She had tiramisu  which I had a cup of excellent espresso.  In the end, a perfect way to celebrate an anniversary. Not sure why we have not been back more frequently but will definately rectify that oversight."}
{"text":"This place is fairly hidden off a side street in Davidson.  At first when I heard it was Italian I immediately thought this place is going to be way too heavy for lunch.   But I gave the place a try and I am happy I did! Not only do they have delicious paninis but they have great salads and of course pasta dishes too.  I have eaten here twice and both time I have loved what I got.  I highly recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service, cozy atmosphere, great wine list.  Everything is made fresh daily, including the pasta... the menu changes seasonally but it's hard to go away from the Spaghetti al Pomodoro, which is excellent."}
{"text":"I'm not the one to do Yelp reviews, but when a restaurant stands out this much, I figured I must! First time visiting North Carolina, originally from Texas! Had a horrible eating experience in Lexington. Came towards Cornelius and, WOW! I was kindly greeted by the owner at the bar. Then seated by Tarra, the wife of the chef and daughter in law of the owner. Welcomed by a dinner menu, and wine list upon my request. Picked out a great red desert wine. I ended up ordering the Vitello Marsala which is Pan seared Veal scaloppini mixed with mushroom Marsala wine sauce! This was the real star of the show! Not to downplay the service, because it was top notch! But the flavors infused in the plate by the chef Joe was insane! Also paired with the meal was a sweet desert wine. For desert was a delicious Cinnamon Toast Crunch cheesecake! All around the place to visit if you're into Italian. You will however not find your typical chicken parm or anything like that. Don't worry, it was well worth it to venture to this establishment!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Il Bosco to celebrate a birthday.  I had seen a write up in Lake Norman magazine and wanted to try the butternut squash gnocchi.  Amazing!  Now if you are looking for the traditional potato gnocchi, this is not it.  Instead, it was a delicious combination of pasta with butternut squash and a hint of nutmeg?  Was delicious and a small portion filled me up.  Would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a Zeppole for St. Joseph's day from the restaurant today.  Not only is that pastry almost impossible to find in the south, but it was amazing!!!!!  Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Il Bosco three times.  Each time, everyone in my party enjoyed their meal immensely.  The pastas were done perfectly al dente and the accompanying sauces were fantastic.  You can order pastas il piccolo or grande.  I order \"il piccolo\" so, I have room for one of their wonderful antipastos or fresh salads.  They also offer a nice selection of poultry, beef, pork and seafood dishes.  One special that appears often on the menu is Branzini.  It is fileted tableside -- a nice touch.  The owner, Jimmy, his wife and wait staff are warm, friendly and accommodating.  I highly recommend Il Bosco!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and each time I am more than pleased with not just the food but the service as well. The wait staff always offers their recommendations and you can follow these with the certainty that you will be satisfied. I highly recommend the grilled romaine salad which is an excellent take on a classic ceasar. I also recommend the veal and the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I can't believe how many years I've lived in the area and have never been to this place!    The waitstaff was awesome, the food was excellent, the ambiance was perfect.  Our table ordered the grilled romaine caesar, chicken marsala, ricotta gnocchi, fettuccine with bolognese, arugula salad, and a couple of other apps.  All were equally delicious.  I'll definitely be back to enjoy more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food in a small welcoming environment.  The gnocchi was the best I've ever had, we'll definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this little place, so we made a reservation for dinner tonight.  The atmosphere was nice, though we could hear all of the conversations around us ... a little music would have muffled.  The food was average, maybe just above.  We are just returning from a 2 year stint in Boston, so I guess our expectation is a little high.  Service was slower than it should have been.  We ordered the caprese salad and they left off the basal - still charged $9 for it.  I had the veal piazza and my wife had the chicken dish - both were ok, nothing I'll remember.  All in all, a little disappointing.  Salad, one glass of wine, two entrees and a veggie and we walked out for $85 -"}
{"text":"This was an amazing dining experience with top notch service. The Cesar salad I had was crisp and so fresh but the best part was the polenta croutons. I ordered the shrimp and polenta for my main entree and I savored every bite.  I wish I had time to order tiramisu for dessert."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in NC!!! Everything on the menu rocks! Sunday is a special day here...check it out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall atmosphere = Small and cozy  Party Size = 6 people  Overall view of the restaurant = 4 of us won't be back.  The other 2 are not sure if they will be back.  Service = Terrible 1) My sister in law told the waitress \"Yes we are ready to order\" when asked if we were ready and then the waitress turned around and addressed the table next to us. 2) Same sister in law tried twice to flag the waitress down (it is a small place so I'm not sure why this was an issue) and said waitress ignored her. 3) My brother in law at one point walked around the table and filled three glasses of wine for us. 4) Water was handled by the owner (?), a nice gentleman who said he was Italian American.  He did a good job.  Wine = Best part of the meal.  Whatever we ordered was a white wine and really good.  Food = Mixed reviews. Calamari - Not bad.  It didn't seem like there was much calamari as compared to the fried veggies on the plate.  Mussels = Not bad.  Not the best, but edible.  Salad = I had something with bacon in it.  Good salad, but I found the dressing in too plentiful a quantity and very bland.  Lamb Chops were raw and inedible.  Spice combination is slightly bland and not tasty at all.  My husband is too nice of a guy to send them back.  He cut them up and then they just sat there while he ate part of other peoples meals.  Fettucine with Meat Sauce = Good. Not the normal meat sauce I am used to (i.e. there were carrots in it), but I'd order again if I had to come here.  Roasted Chicken = The person who ordered this raved about it.  Chicken with white stuff (speck?) = 3 people ordered this and all of them cleaned their plates.  No dessert was ordered because, frankly, we just wanted to get out of the place."}
{"text":"Very elegant restaurant, perfect for a date night. Our waitress was top notch. The food was good. However, the restaurant was not crowded whatsoever and my father and I were told we had to sit in the bar area because we were wearing sandals despite the fact we were wearing nice outfits. There were individuals in the dining room that did not seem appropriately dressed but apparently weren't wearing sandals. Not a huge deal but not impressed by how that was handled."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant that has amazing Italian.  Very authentic.  You will need reservations."}
{"text":"First let me say, the food is great here. But the service leaves something to be desired. I've never had good service any of the times I've been there. It's a small place and the staff just stands around staring at you. It's very awkward. The last time I went I walked in to a completely empty restaurant (it was open), and the guy I assume was the manager asked \"what can I do for you\"...um...\"I would like to sit down and eat????\". He told me they were full up. It was like a movie. I looked around and literally there was nobody in the place. I shrugged that off and asked if I could just eat at the bar...his reply \"No, you can't. We don't serve at the bar.\" Seriously...I was stunned. I live within walking distance to this restaurant and I always have raved about the place. I am seriously disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant. This is not a \"meatball and lasagna place\".  The food is absolutely wonderful with special attention to detail. The atmosphere is intimate and quiet. The menu changes seasonally so you will always find new things to try."}
{"text":"Second time here for dinner, trout, salmon, classic linguine bolognese all excellent. Brussels sprouts, broccoli, risotto sides better than ever. Still my favorite restaurant in Davidson."}
{"text":"Love Davidson and this is a nice little restaurant with great food.  We went there for our anniversary lunch.  The food is authentic Italian.  The service was friendly and prompt.  They also have an outside patio which is very nice."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Il Bosco on our last date night and we really enjoyed ourselves. It is elegant dining and we had a top notch server who was very accommodating with my wife's dairy/egg sensitivity. Our waiter asked the chef which dishes she could have and he tried his best to help her without sacrificing the taste of his dishes (she had wanted a salad sans goat cheese, but the chef refused to serve it that way, haha! I think his being so demanding and specific speaks to the quality of the food there)  The Bruschetta was amazing, the bread was warm and fresh, and the Porterhouse for 2 was excellent (albeit pretty darn expensive). Nice place for a special occasion and we found out they serve pastries for breakfast during the week!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Service 5/5, Food 4/5, Ambience 4/5.   Service-Great restaurant overall. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and anticipated our needs. She was very pleasant to talk to and made our visit exceptional.  The manager/owner also came and checked on our meal. He also was very nice.   Food- The mussel appetizer was delicious but I had a few that were a little \"strong\". The salad special with fried goat cheese was amazing- my wife and I loved the dressing especially. The Veal Paccata was pretty good and tasty. The lamb entree was good but underseasoned."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant North of Charlotte.  Fresh, seasonal carefully thought out menu.  Excellant wine choices.  Delicious homemade desserts.     It is little out of my budget to go regularly, but most certainly my first choice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood find up in Davidson, NC.  The Italian food is exactly like what my grandmother used to make.  Whether is the homemade bread, the fresh pasta, the great salads to start your meal off, or the amazing deserts, you are not going to go home hungry or wishing you had chosen something else - the menu is great top to bottom.  And talk about reasonably priced - we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We cannot say enough about the meal we had here last night!  First, understand that we were in the Charlotte area for my son's college graduation.  Since my father's 78th birthday was only a week away and he and my mom were with us for the graduation, we decided to surprise him with dinner a week early on Saturday night. HOWEVER, when I booked online with OpenTable, I accidentally chose 5/21 (his actual bday) instead of 5/14 (the night we were going to be in town).  I didn't realize this until we arrived at the restaurant only to find we had no reservation!!!!!  So, some how, they were able to squeeze us in...turns out, it was also the local college graduation so every place was busy.  They had to juggle things around a bit, it is a rather small location.  The patio looked beautiful although we were seated inside which was intimate and great for the four adults and conversation.  Calamari, perfectly cooked, tender,not chewy at all! I had the braised rabbit ravioli (to die for!) and my husband had the veal piccatta, my mother the chicken marsala, and my dad had the seared duck breast.  We tried a side of the brussel sprouts with honey...we all detest BS's..but these were phenomenal and we will have to try and recreate them at home.  Every dish was fabulous (we tasted everything)!  If we could have licked the plates, we would have...my mother and husband almost never finish all of their meal - there was not one speck of food left on any of our plates. We all decided to go for dessert since the meal was so fantastic and were not disappointed.  My husband and I had the tiramisu (delicious), my father the cannoli's (best I've had outside of Philly or NY), and my mother had the chocolate Granada (her eyes rolled back in her head).  Best Italian meal I've had in years.  I only wish we lived closer so this could be a regular stop for us, because it surely would be.  If you are visiting Davidson or the Concord/Charlotte area, it is worth the drive to experience this restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a gem! A co-worker of mine is a regular here and somewhat of a foodie, so my expectations of this place were already pretty high. First, may I say that this place is CLASSY . . . dim lights, pillars, red wines tastefully displayed throughout, and Franky playing in the background. I ordered something new to the menu . . squash gnocci's. They melted in my mouth. I will be back for their wine tasting for sure."}
{"text":"Il Bosco is the go-to restaurant in Davidson for business dinners, romantic dates for the young and old, and for a damn classy evening with your mom. I've had mixed experiences with the salads, but the more traditional Italian pastas (homemade) are always very good. The service is eager to please and courteous. Make a reservation if you're coming on the weekend so you can secure a spot amongst the loads of regular locals."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Reasonably priced, wonderful staff and overall excellent experience. The pastries and coffee are also delicious so don't fill up on antipasto and the main course you are going to want to save room for desserts! I have been eating here for a few years and have never had a bad experience."}
