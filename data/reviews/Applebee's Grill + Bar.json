{"text":"This place is ridiculous! My friends and I went in for dinner and a few drinks long story short my friend asked my fag friend wants to know what drink that is meaning a joke and she said fuck you to him! Well my other friend went up to her near the manager and he did NOTHING you can not do that in a restaurant. We will be letting the entire surprise community know what happened you can not say fuck you to a customer. The women who said that we hope you get fired! Applebee's you just lost a customer! GM we hope you read this and do something to resolve this"}
{"text":"great food but a little expensive good service and friendly waiters"}
{"text":"Im a huge applebees fan, only the happy hour tho lol.  I have been to alot around the valley and i just moved to laveen, and this one is the best one i have ever been to. this place is 2.3 miles away from man that's just amazing....   Not amazing anymore. Place has gone down hill"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the amount of sodium and the calories in the oriental chicken rollup I had yesterday!  I went to their corporate site and checked out the nutrition table they have posted (kudos for having it!).  1180 calories for the rollup - that doesn't count the fries, and 3220 mg of sodium - that's more that 50% over the recommended daily intake of 2000mg.  Last time I will ever eat at any Applebees.  They do have a 550 or less calories lunch menue, but not on weekends!!"}
{"text":"Great food cold beers and great service.  I wish we had an applebees in hawaii.  Omar is a great server he took great care of us.  I wish I could give more than five stars."}
{"text":"This is the worst Applebees I have been too. I went with 5 friends and our waitress was really rude. We all already had two beverages and we did buy food, when we asked for a third round she questioned how many drinks we had, and said well I guess you guys can have another one since you bought food. Then shortly after I received my watered down jagger bomber the waitress came and said are you ready for your tickets? ... right after we received our drinks, we were basically shoved out and didn't feel welcomed at all. Every other Applebees I have never had a problem but this one is just horrible!"}
{"text":"This place got two stars only because the manager our server was the worst ever I had to ask for water three times and he was really rude about bringing it back. We had to flag him down the third time because he was not coming to our table. If it wasn't for his manager being so nice we would have left."}
{"text":"I was with my bae and the waiter asked us what we wanted I asked for a water and he looked at me like I was crazy sohe resumes asks my bf what he wants to drink he replied Pepsi and when I made my order of food he then looked at my bf asking him what he wanted he replied nothing the guy asked repeatedly if he was sure then gave him a dirty look like if he was poor but shitty service please don't go here"}
{"text":"As a individual who frequently eats out, this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. Food was horrible. Service was slow. But at least the balloon artist was able to keep my grandson entertained.  And then we hadn't suffered enough so decided to get dessert also. Don't order the churros and smores, because according to the waitress, it takes a long time because of the process of baking the marshmallow. They weren't kidding!!!"}
{"text":"First time to this Applebee's location, it was acceptable. However, our server Ricci made all the difference, she was very friendly, attentive, and made sure all our needs were met before tending to other duties. I think I found a new Sunday Funday spot."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was bad . Took forever to get our bill. Nearly walked out."}
{"text":"Came with my daughter and got the 2 entrees for 20$ special. I had the fiesta lime chicken, it was a fairly large portion, and really yummy! My daughter had the 3 cheese chicken penne, which she liked but wasn't as hot as it should have been. Food was good overall. Server Dana was great, friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The waitresses are beyond slow, and once they are done flirting with the table next to you, she might  visit your table and then disappear."}
{"text":"So, based on my prior review, the district manager sent me a few complimentary meal vouchers.  I was hesitant to even go back . . . and I shouldn't have.  I got a cheddar, bacon burger that was so full of grissle and bone that I nearly pucked on the second bite.  I ordered a steak for my mother.  It was smothered with  . . . oh heck, I don't know . . but it tasted awful.  The steak was ordered medium, received well done, but did have good taste.  Sadly, and 85 year old woman couldn't chew the well done lump of a steak.  The chips and dip were as nasty as before.  The oil is old and tastes rancid.  The only good part of the meal was the dessert.  The brownie and ice cream were delicious, and about the only decent part of a $40 meal.  I'll never go there again, comp or no comp.  Not good food."}
{"text":"Dan is the man, Best bartender! Great staff and awesome manager Stephen. My favorite restaurant for food and happy hour."}
{"text":"This was my first time here as we were shopping in the area with my family and haven't had dinner yet. Ya a good choice.  Nice, homely atmosphere and great food to go along with it. I tried their Sheppards Pie and was glad I did. Next best thing to being home made. Fianc√© had salad and French onion soup with garlic bread. She liked it, but wasn't the best soup she has ever had, should have been made with croutons.  Step son had the veggie burger as there was not many veggie alternatives. Still was tasty though, he said. Staff were polite and friendly, food was quick and accurate. All in all a great experience, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me & my wife always have a good time here.. It's great for what we like & the staff is always nice to us"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time we went to Applebee's in Laveen, to sum it up quickly.  Horrible.  Appetizer = Microwaved buffalo wings that had turned cold again, served with old cheese stuck to the plate, when cheese doesn't come with the wings.  Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp = Chicken tasted like salmon, shrimp was cold, and the mushrooms tasted like they skipped the cleaning process.  We had 2 bites to eat and decided to ask for the check, waitress asked if we wanted boxes..... We quickly said no, she showed no concern to ask about if anything was wrong with our food, said okay and brought back the check.  Put the check on the table and walked off, not a word. Came back and grabbed check with payment, not a word. Brought receipt for signature, not a word.  Since she cared about our food and experience, I showed the same respect in her tip.  We left, not a word more than I wrote on the receipt telling them to step their game up.  We are not going to be going back to this Applebee's... I can't even say \"not anytime soon\" because it is beyond that and is now NEVER"}
{"text":"Me and my boy friend ate here a few days ago. And we loved it. There was a problem in the kitchen with our ticket but our waitress took action immediately to ask us what we jad ordered and theyd make it on the fly. And for having to wait a few extra minutes she braught us a free desert. Our waitress made the wait bareable and it ws nice to just sit and pend time out of the house. Thank you personally to India W. Who was our waitress that evening."}
{"text":"Ordered car side and had to call from my car after waiting 15 minutes past the pickup time. They asked what I ordered then said they were just packing it up and would be right out. I called again 15 minutes later and they said they would check and be right out. They came out and told me that they didn't have grilled vegetables that I ordered would I like French fries? They didn't even give me a discount. Got home and the steak was raw and hard, could not chew it. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Applebee's is where you go when you have no energy to look for a new place. However we've been going out quite a bit since moving here and I have to say this particular location has such an uncomfortable atmosphere. Our waiter was very short with us and very dry. The only time she had some pep in her step was when she brought the check and of course wanted her tip. Sorry but I won't tip even decently if you can't be generally nice to one of the few tables you're waiting on. I don't ask for much except a smile and some simple courtesy. Whoever is hiring the workers in the bar area need to do a team building exercise or SOMETHING! Also one of the waiters kept staring at our table and making it even more weird. Never coming back to this one and neither are any of the people we were with!"}
{"text":"First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.  Its always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care.   We actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another.   Just go anywhere else, it can't be worse!"}
{"text":"A pleasant evening out with great staff and delicious food.   Our server made a small snafu with our salad (unordered). It could've been our fault. Out come the head hostess or manager with a slight European accent. She offered a complimentary dish. It wasn't necessary.  I just hate to waste food.  \"Come see us again, the manager chimed as we were leaving.\"  You bet we will and you should too!"}
{"text":"Was not happy with the food! Pasta was served without its sauce.. And after getting the sauce was still flavorless. The kids food was bad tasting as well.. Applebee's has lost their way.. :("}
{"text":"Stopped today and was there last month. Both times, they were short on staff. However; the waitress was apologetic and was very good on both occasions. The food was also good both times. It's nothing extraordinary but it's always decent lunch fare.  Will always go back."}
{"text":"It's not the best Applebees here in Vegas but they have good food and drinks and so close to my place then i usually go there on weekends."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Applebees for a couple drinks haven't been there in a while ordered the $8  twofer ordered nachos and the sweet potato fries sweet potato fries were okay the Nacho on the other hand were horrible, that's also supposed to have green chili beef  there was no meat at all on the nachos except for a bunch of fat. When I mentioned it to my waitress she was concerned she said she'll talk to her manager she came back and said sir you only get 3 ounces of meat on your nachos and I told her that's fine but it wasn't meat it was pure fat and disgusting. They took a dollar off my tab. The $3 Long Island iced teas we're OK should have just stayed with the drinks"}
{"text":"I went on Monday during happy hour and I was very please with the food and the service also the amazing happy hour prices!!  I'm definitely going to continue going back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pepper-crusted sirloin & whole grains. The sirloin was very tender and nicely paired with the whole grains and spinach. I didn't care for the grape tomatoes that came with the dish. For dessert I had the hot fudge sundae shooter. I was expecting hot fudge, but it was more like chocolate syrup."}
{"text":"Brownish lettuce NOT appealing especially in their relatively expensive Oriental Salad"}
{"text":"My very first review EVER downloaded the app just to do so.... I love applebees the foods always great!! This location however has let me down time and time again this time was the last time I ever visit this location. SERVICE IS ALWAYS HORRIBLE HERE!!!! I can't even stretch this enough! It took him 45 minutes to realize he never put our order in then he wasn't even the one that brought our food out and we asked the two people that did bring out our food for things and no one ever got us anything. At the very end the manager finally came to check on us but by that time the ice in the drink was practically melted!! I will not be returning  don't go to this location I don't know if they are short staffed or what but it's been like this every time I go!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Food is salty. I believe they use MSG. Not worth for the time and money."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend visit this location often at least 3 times a month. It was never excellent service but we enjoy the food and occasionally we got great service. Tonight was HORRIBLE, the night started off waiting 20+ minutes for WATER. After someone finally acknowledged us we ordered, another 15 minutes later we got our appetizers. The chips and salsa was covered in salt. When they brought out of main entrees they didn't give us everything we ordered (which they had charged us for) and they had made my order wrong. The waitress never checked in on us after speaking with the manager about our disappointment because we are regulars here. They covered our check but we did not finish the meal and left immediately. WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"I don't like it. Slow service, unappetizing dishes. Salmon and shrimps are always overcooked. Soup has strange test. Terrible place!"}
{"text":"It is what it is- a fast food restaurant. Don't order steaks from here because all they are is fused together meat which is gross. It's not quality steak at all. It's what you should expect from a chain like this though. You should go to these kinds of restaurants ordering a few types of things- appetizers, salads, pasta dishes, and burgers. They shouldn't sell anything else because they're not quality. I like the burgers when I go here. I got some black and blue burger the last time i went and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was okay. Not very quick honestly. Drink prices are kinda overpriced but then again it is a chain restaurant so I'm not surprised. Just takes a while to get drinks delivered to your table. My mixed drink didn't even come until my entree was done!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and our server did a great job explaining some of the menu items.  Our food came out hot and it was tasty.  The dining room was clean and I especially liked the local pictures in the dining room.  It made the restaurant feel more like it was home town and less like a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Our waiter told us if we ate everything off our plates, we'd get free cookies. At the end of our meal, he said I wouldn't get any because I chose not to eat a piece of lettuce that fell onto the table, which was built-up in layers of gross, sticky grime.   He again stated I'd need to eat the lettuce, if I wanted my free dessert. I asked if he was kidding, to which he answered \"NO\" in a rather snotty attitude. I said I wasn't going to eat the lettuce, because it was unsanitary and I didn't really want a flipping cookie anyway. And I mean, how often are those wash rags that they use to wipe the table actually cleaned?   No tip for him..."}
{"text":"Can I give -100?!? Seriously.  We were 2 people and we ordered bourbon steak and a Caesar salad each. The waitress wasn't bad and polite. The Caesar salad was good (chain restaurant standard). But then came the bourbon steak and it was horribly salty. Both of us did not say anything thinking it was each our taste buds. The amount of black pepper was too much too. I couldn't finish my steak  as I felt I was eating salt and nothing else. Oh well, we did not complain on the spot. But as we were leaving, the host, a young guy with a mere mustache asked us if we enjoyed our meal, and we told him it was too salty(very politely). Guess what! He mocked us in our face and he was laughing at us and told us that when we will be back tomorrow we won't feel the salt.  The person I was with didn't want to aggravate the situation by calling the manager. But NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Applebee's many times before and their food and service is always average. Nothing to write home about but not necessarily poor. This location was just that, average.   We were seated in the bar and we had a friendly server. The food was surprsingly good. We wouldn't have come here except for the fact that we had a gift card but I was pleasantly satisfied with the entire dining experience.   Keep in mind, they do half off drink and appetizers during happy."}
{"text":"Love the Applebee's menu, absolutely hate that they can't seat a group of more than 6, other than in the bar area, right under a speaker that was playing music that was way too loud and obviously more for the wait and cook staff. Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Waiter actually had the nerve to lie to my face and tell me that the music couldn't be lowered any more than it already was."}
{"text":"We've always heard of this chain, but unfortunately never had the chance to try it. We decide to stop in for lunch on Monday. When we first walked in, we were greeted by a young lady who had an attitude. She looked annoyed with her job and it pushed over to us. She asked if we wanted a booth or table and we requested a booth. She took us over to the booths and wanted to seat us in the middle of 5 booths which were all full. I requested if we could move farther away from the other diners as we like a more a quieter place to enjoy our meals. It took over 10 minutes for our server , Makayla, to show up and ask for our drink orders. It took her another 10 minutes to bring back our drinks. One of us had some coffee and was told that she was going to bring us back some sugar and waited and waited until finally I had to remind her to which she admitted she completely forgot about. She then asked if we were ready for our food orders. We opted for the Oriental Salad and two house burgers. She asked if we wanted our burgers slightly pink and we both agreed. It took a little over 35 minutes to get our food over to our table. When we got our food, the burgers were splattered on the plates with no lettuce, tomato, onions etc. only cheese and a deformed burger. We requested the additional toppings and she brought them over pretty quick. The burger was disgusting. It was bland with no flavor at all. The bun was soggy and the cheese was stale and slightly melted. The only reason they're getting a one star is because it won't let me do 0 stars and because the salad was decent. As we sat there trying to eat this horrendous food, we never saw Makayla again. We saw her again when she took over our bill and quickly bolted away never asking how our food was or if we need some more drinks. This is definitely the last time I ever eat at one of these chains again! The service was horrible and the food was even worse!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner this evening at Applebee's in Laveen. I ate at the bar since I was alone and boy what a great idea that turned out to be! The bartender, Paxton, not only served one of the best dinners I've eaten in a while (peppered steak from the pub diet menu, high in protein, low in calories) but he also kept me entertained. All employees were working quickly, efficiently and were having fun doing it!     If it's been a while since you've been to Appkebe's, go back! Enjoy! lkk."}
{"text":"This Applebee's seems to think it is a night club at 430 at night music is blasting food is mediocre at best  time for new management the foxes are running the hen house"}
{"text":"The food actually wasn't that bad when you don't have high expectations. My mother and I used to frequent the bar in the afternoon when it was quiet in the restaurant so we had a lot of nice talks with the staff. I wouldn't come here for a gourmet meal but if you are in the area and want a quick and relatively cheap bite to eat I would come here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service once younger waited on. Sat for a while waiting to be waited on."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a half of a half of a millionth of a half of a burnt out star...This place shouldn't even get a star..it should be a frown. The food was gross, i was served by robots...and the 2 for 20 ...what a joke..urrrrrr......had the bourbon chicken and shrimp..only one problem...there were no shrip..just this shriveled up hydrated looking things..like you find in cup shrimp cup of noodles. The chicken was like rubber chew toy....I could go on...but I don't want to waste my finger energy...esp since I have none since I didn't get any eatable food and am still hungry"}
{"text":"My husband had the new 5-cheese Mac and Cheese with chicken. Looked pretty good and he said it was tasty.  I however had the tried-and-true baby back ribs. Awful! Very dry to the point the meat was very cooked down and the ends were all but burned. They didn't even try to cover it up with globs of bbq sauce, which is a common stunt. Very BLEH... Won't ever get the ribs there again and highly dis-recommend them from others. Ew."}
{"text":"Food was good, nice location, and we had a great server(Melinda)."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday.  First, the new menu is CONFUSING!  Even our waitress agreed.  Ordered the brisket sliders, they tasted slightly burnt and had way too much sauce.  Side salad was ok.  Husband's 1/2 sandwich and salad was just ok.  Bathrooms were DIRTY!  I don't know when these are checked, but it looked like it had been DAYS.  Won't be back.  The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because we had a nice waitress."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food, but I never even got the chance!   My Mom and I were shopping on N. Prospect and decided to stop in for lunch. We walked in and waited by the hostess stand. We waited and waited and waited.  Several servers walked by and just looked at us. So, we decided that if they didn't want to seat us, we'd go somewhere else. As we turned to leave someone finally noticed us and we told them that we were going since nobody would acknowledge us. After an apology and a promise that they'd take great care of us, we were taken to a table.    Once at the table we waited again! No waiter came by at all. They walked by our table but didn't stop. We gave up and just left. We went across the street and got Steak N Shake and got immediate attention.  Very frustrating. I just wanted a light soup and salad for lunch. I never got the chance."}
{"text":"Good food. The atmosphere is casual and quiet enough to carry on a conversation. On Monday, they have burgers for $5.99, nice deal. The staff if friendly."}
{"text":"My experience here was the worst, we had to wait about 15 minutes before our waitress came to take our order. Food was cold when it delivered. Customer service wasn't great."}
{"text":"Came in for the second time here to give it another shot as last time i came it was not the greatest. AGAIN disappointed i wont step foot in here again. Im typing fhis review as im waiting for a piece of lemon for 10minutes now for my shrimp plate. Waiter is horrible she needs to invest in a note pad and stop trying to remember the orders trying to impress the customers. She would actually impress me more by getting my order right with all the extras i asked for."}
{"text":"I went here to have a quick sit down at the bar and a bite with a friend at the bar. I expected to have a relatively good time, but little did I know the bar was being hosted that night by the Ice Queen. Cold treatment from this host from the moment we first ordered our beers, complete with being chided over my perfectly valid ID, to having to ask for a menu after waiting quite some time (instead of being asked if we wanted food, like most bartenders would??) so we could even get the food we came for!  When the food came, the wings looked like someone had quite literally emptied a sauce bottle over them - they were sitting in a puddle! Never had to dip a wing 4-5 times in ranch just to get some on it before! At least the Quesadilla was tasty, though I really didn't appreciate being disagreed with by the bartender about leaving off the Pico de Gallo. Tomatoes make me violently sick, I don't need your bloody opinion about them being on the dish!  Thankfully, an otherwise infuriating experience was mostly rectified by the bubbly friendliness of the waiter who came to send the previous bartender on a break. The replacement and her friendly, happy demeanor is probably the main reason why I didn't simply walk out. While I still rushed my dinner (and my friends) so we could get the heck out of dodge, it was a relief to see that the first employee wasn't a wholly accurate example of the staff. Primarily for that reason I'm willing to give three stars, unlike the one or two I angrily wanted to. I hope my experience with the staff to be a fluke."}
{"text":"Now I know why so many Applebee's restaurants are closing. I had a gift card and had to go out of my way to find a restaurant near me. Both my and my daughter's food was practically unedible. I ordered fish and chips that was almost burnt. My daughter ordered the sliders which were also cooked dry. The server was nice enough, but I will not go out of my way to come here for a bad meal again."}
{"text":"So myself and my girl just left applebees and the experience started off rocky by having 0 clean tables than making us wait  1 1/2 hours for APPETIZERS alone and then the boneless wings were cold and my spinach artichoke dip was setteled and crusted over you know ? Cause it has cheese in it, the service was terrible had no refills the entire time i was there while the table full of dudes got all her attention, and when the food finally was brought out my \"medium\" steak was burnt my girls \"medium\" burger was well done at this point i was furious and handled it in a manor that wasnt correct but i just felt literally disrespected so i walked out. The manager caught me outside and was wondering if i paid for my meal i told him that i couldnt and explained my reasoning he said i shoulda came to him and i agreed but i didnt want to over react on him so i removed the myself, anyway he didnt apologize after hearin my explaination and offered nothin to try and get my business back... a customer is 90% more likely to stay loyal if there problem is fixed than the customer that never had one. Will never be back... TILL I DIE lol jk but for real never goin back"}
{"text":"My wife and myself went Saturday evening about 6:30pm and were told there would be a 25 min wait.. We looked around restaurant and it was 1/2 empty and could see empty booths and tables. I asked the hostess why were they telling people 25 min wait with all the empty tables, She told me the kitchen was behind and they were not allowed to seat any more people. At least three other couples came in and were told 20 to 25 min wait, all of them decided not to stay. It seems like a bad policy to tell people they will have to wait in the lobby and lose business, rather than seat them and get their drinks and be comfortable and then tell them kitchen is a little slow.  Why would the kitchen be behind with a small crowd?. When we sat and ordered food it came out very quickly and was very good .Just crazy policy to me"}
{"text":"Waited and waited for a table at lunch time. Two parties (each with two in the party) came in after us (we were also two) and both of them were seated before us - one pair was even seated at a table in the area we requested. We left and I will never return. The food isn't worth that kind of treatment."}
{"text":"We ordered the 10.99 special with steak. The steaks were the perfect size for us and they were cooked perfectly. I had a delicious wedge salad and my wife had the best spinach salad ever. It came with garlic spinach. Yum. The steak came with a really good vadalia onion sauce. We have eaten at several all over the country and we get the small sre"}
{"text":"While I normally don't expect much from a mid-level chain like this, I am very disappointed after my second visit here. My first visit was during the holidays, and the service was very slow and the food mediocre.   Per the server, he was actually just a temp from the kitchen who they brought out to help out. I guess the fact that his nametag said \"Batman\" should have been the tip-off.  My second visit was a week ago and the service was again very slow, with no one checking on our table or refilling drinks while we waited for what seemed forever for our food. Once the food did arrive, the meat was cold in the middle, and everything else on the plate seemed to just be tossed on without care.   No interest in returning here."}
{"text":"Came here to get out of the heat, sit in some A/C and have a burger.  My husband and I ordered burgers and appetizers.  They have a great happy hour at 3pm for 1/2 price appetizers...cool deal!  So, our burgers come and my mushroom swiss burger doesn't look right.  I kinda poke at it..no mushrooms..and a weird gravy on it. I let an employee know and he immediately took the plate away.  Jaime, the manager, came by and profusely apologized and said, \"That was NOT what you ordered.  I'm really sorry about that.\"  He said they were making my burger again and he said he was going to give it to me on the house!  I never expected that!  My burger came and it was perfect.  I really like Applebees...their service is quick, their staff is friendly, and I can sit and watch some sports and relax.  Thank you Jaime!  This shows that there are restaurant managers who do care about customer service and customer experience  :)"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food is ok. My son had earned a coupon for a free kids me and drink for good grades at his elementary school, which is the only reason we decided to go there. We gave it to the waitress before we even ordered or drinks. When we got out bill, it had a full adult meal and drink on it for our son. The waitress admittedly punched in by mistake an adult hamburger meal and drink and said she will talk to her manager about changing our bill.  When we got our bill the 2nd time, all they had done was discount out bill $5.99, the equivalent of a child's kids meal. So I still ended up paying the difference of adult meal minus $5.99 plus a lemonade for $3.45. So I paid almost $8.00 for my son's \"free\" meal.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, reasonably priced food and great ambience.  Great for a date night, dinner with friends or a family dinner out. Great choices on the menu, especially the healthy choices, but I feel they could expand upon their offerings. Portions could be a tad bit bigger."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here for dinner tonight and it was horrible! We planned on sitting at the bar and eating but that didn't happen cause it took 5 minutes to get me my beer and her water and it wasn't busy. Then we sat there for another 15 minutes without either bartender asking us if we were going to order food. The guy was to busy watching the soccer game and the girl was to busy talking. So we asked for a table and asked to speak to a manager and told her what happened. She said she talked to the bartenders and that the guy said he asked us if we wanted menus but he never did, he just didn't want to get in trouble. The servers and bartenders are very unprofessional and I don't think that place will be there long. Chili's will hopefully be better but I think the Texas Roadhouse down the street will still be the best place in the area. The only reason I gave two stars is because our food was good but we will not be going back there. We will go to the one on Northern or Bell."}
{"text":"Service was good, drink was good, food was not terrible but disappointing. Wonton tacos are awesome!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for this LOCATION ONLY! I love Applebees and go there several times a month. I've given this location a chance 3 times. They have awful service and its not like I have gotten the same server each time. No, different one each time. The last time I went there I wait 5 minutes for a refill on my soda while my waiter knew I needed another soda but he decided to hang out in the bar. Maybe he was waiting on another customers drink to be made and he had to watch over the bartender to make sure he was making it right. Who knows. Everytime I go there I have an issue with the service. Im honestly NOT a demanding person or really anal. I just like a server who remembers Im there. Again just this location. I will now just go to the one on sunset and stephanie MUCH better service. The resturaunt itself has decent pricing. Typical for a resturaunt. Expect to spend thirty bucks or so for 2 people. Even with the 2 for $20. The food... I cant say much as I had only tried 3 things on the menu and then got addicted to the firepit burger... If you get it ask for extra chipotle-mayo, its amazing! Everytime I go there I tell myself today is the day I will try something new but when the server comes, firepit burger just rolls off my tongue. Never been disappointed with it."}
{"text":"I just came by to compare the ratings to O'Charley's because I just left there feeling disappointed and annoyed with myself for trying there again and I'm shocked this place has a lower rating.  I have never had a bad experience here in the 20+ times going.  The food is always delicious, the bartenders are delightful and the server Ron/Ronnie is just a great young man!  I would choose Applebee's over O'Charley's or Chili's any day!  They are easier to pull in and out of for one!  Honestly though, this place always impresses me, I'm never left regretting my decision to come here.  I wish they had outdoor seating but that is honestly the only drawback."}
{"text":"2nd time coming to this location. 1st time bad experience 2nd time had another down fall. Fries cold took over 20min to get a new batch. Received Cold again. Come on only fries how hard could that have been. Then when telling the manager all he could say is I could get you a new order. Wow sure why not let me eat another cold batch with another 30min later. Sure I am just going to site around and wait for another cold plate of fries."}
{"text":"Ordered soup and a chicken wrap.  Tomato basil soup was good.  Silverware ws dirty so had to ask for clean replacement.  Chicken wrap had mostly lettuce and cheese with very little chicken.  I asked them to re-make it.  It came out with only chicken in a tortilla with no cheese, lettuce or tomato.  Last time I will eat here.  Very poor quality food."}
{"text":"My brother in law wanted to eat here so we did.   Greasy, microwaved food prepared by teenagers is just perfect for my BIL, not for me.  This is basically cafeteria quality food similar to any other big chain like Denny's or Friday's.  I usually avoid these places.  This trip to Applebee's reminds me why I do avoid these places."}
{"text":"A typical Applebee's.  We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly and very attentive (maybe a little too much so).  We waited a bit for our food but it was a Friday night so we didn't really think anything of it.  I had the Shrimp and Broccoli pasta and it was good but the shrimp were a bit undercooked.  Overall, it's what you would expect to get from this chain."}
{"text":"Applebee's has always been our top 5 go to places for eating. Last week, me along with my family went there on an evening and we were waiting to be seated. 1/3rd of the restaurant was empty (the total left isle was empty). There was no one at the reception and we continued to wait there for almost 12-13 minutes. Waiters were passing and no one even bothered to either helped us to be seated nor informed their colleague/receptionist. Finally, we had to step out. Then I called the manager once I left the place and asked her if there is a wait time in their restaurant. She said they have enough place for a big group. Then I told her my experience and she was dead silent. I hope she atleast talks to her staff before more people start experiencing this and before this place comes to part. But you just lost 3 customers, who would never return at any cost......"}
{"text":"No server ever came to our table. We sat for 20 minutes looking around.....maybe 9pm on a tuesday is just not the time to come- i guess the servers were all sleep walking? Although the 2 tables (both parties of 2) that came in after us (party of 5) were both attended to right away....?"}
{"text":"This place is honestly kind of trash. The food quality continuously deteriorates and the staff is outrageously non attentive. I ordered car side to go last week and even told them I would go inside to pay because I know the girl is a little slow with bringing it out and noticing that the customers there. After standing at the to go desk for 10 minutes looking at my order I had to find the manager at the hostess desk to bring him over to pay. This place only gets 1 stars because of the bartender named Ash who is quite a delight."}
{"text":"Kristie C service today was horrible. Took too long to take drink order, took to long to take food order, food took forever to arrive and it wasn't even hot! Garlic bread was cold! Kid never got refill, another person in my party water was taken to refill but never brought back. Took forever to receive check. I'm a regular at this Applebee's but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"There's few restaurants I've been to that make me feel like an inconvenience.  Upon ordering drinks, I was told that I could only get three drinks before I have to get the ok from the manager to continue drinking. This was before my first drink order even got to the bartender.  Ok, so I won't drink.  Moving onto the food, I ordered the 3 cheese penne pasta. I believe it's the same dish another yelper talked about, $12 and four small strips of chicken on Alfredo pasta. It was maybe half of a chicken breast, and that's being generous.  And where are our drinks? Oh yeah, they show up long after receiving our entrees. I don't even know how anyone could drink 3+ alcoholic beverages, we had to pull teeth just to get one! Oh, and check out the picture of the awesome celery that came with the boneless chicken wings. That pretty much sums up the whole meal.  Finally, the bill. We had a whole convo with the waitress about needing the drinks on a separate bill because food is comped for work trips but alcohol isn't. So when she tried to give us the check we told her we needed it separated (there were two of us).  The waitress said, so drinks on one? No...drinks also separate per person and from the food. Did she forget the convo we just had?  So the checks are delivered separated by person with drinks and food all together...fail. At that point it was just time to leave"}
{"text":"This is a worst Appleby I ever been 5 of us got four beer and waited for another 15 min and when we got the beer not even sorry. You better have lots of time to wait when you come here"}
{"text":"Waited 10 mins for drinks. Waited an hour and 15 mins for dinner plus it was not hot at all and there were only a few other tables.  The waitress was very scarce. I had to go to the bar to get silverware after waiting for a bit for the waitress to come back around."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Applebee's for a while because we had such a long wait the last time we were here.  Well, things haven't changed.  It wasn't busy this afternoon yet it still took over 30 minutes to finally get our order.  Will not be back here for a long time....."}
{"text":"This area needed something like this - It's not fantastic or in any way outstanding but not bad either. I'd rate it as an average place to go if you want some variety."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices pretty good. Spinach artichoke dip and tortilla chips kind of salty. Our server was Olivia who made a pretty good Long Island iced tea but wasn't as attentive as Racquel was the last time we were in. Still overall we love the food here, usually good."}
{"text":"This place was very dirty. There were small bugs in the martini. Took forever to get our food. Couldn't order a beer because taps were messed up and took 20 minutes to get a beer, by the time it came I was over drinking the beer. Gross dirty place and no one cares. Won't be back"}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. The service sucked, took forever to even get a drink order in. Once the drinks arrived, my friend jalape√±o mango margarita was warm and tasted solely of mango pur√©e. Then the food took 30 mins plus and when it arrived it was cold, over cooked and soggy! AND my friends baked potato was ROTTEN!!! So nasty! When we asked to speak to the manager no one came to apologize, the server just took the food off our bill and we paid for our watered down alcoholic drinks! Never again stepping foot in this place!!"}
{"text":"I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now. For some reason the service and quality of food keep getting worse and worse. The last 3 times I've either eaten in or ordered take out, the staff has screwed up my order. Time for me to go to a new location and or restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered pork wonton tacos as appetizer. Pork was dried out chunks that tasted like the end of ham, sort of like the end rind. Complained, but kitchen manager did not report back and tell me what he found in the kitchen, as both me and my partner thought he would do. Ordered the bruschetta chicken salad. The tomatoes were not made into a bruschetta, but huge chunks. No red onion or roasted peppers to be found, as pictured and described. I have ordered these dishes before in another location and never been disappointed.  Staff needs retraining on the correct presentation and ingredients. The manager did not even offer  to exchange my appetizer or take it off my bill. Your manager can find me if he chooses to make it right. This was at the Power/ Ray Rd location in Gilbert, AZ. My ticket number is TB#41, ordered 2 salads and appetizer. on 1-13-12.  Called  Applebee's corporate in KC and was called by the store manager the same day. Funny how that results in quick action as I was issued a gift card.  And no, I do not work for nor have I ever worked  for any restaurant or diner or food establishment in the last 30 years. I simply want to spend my money on establishments that provide both good food and service."}
{"text":"To pink or not too pink, that is the question.  Will I ever learn? In a desperate attempt for fuel consumption last night, we ended up at Applebees. Since it was near 9pm, we wanted something light and something simple.  The waitress came fairly quickly, almost every 2 minutes throughout the selection process. It's been almost 8 months since we partook of their offerings and the Websters dictionary they were using as a menu took a rather long time to get through. Doubly so, since we were wrangling a tired sproglet at the same time. Throughout the night, her personality lagged from snappiness to downright rude by the end of the evening. -1.5  My partner ordered the Ultimate Trio (Boneless Buffalo Wings, Cheeseburger sliders and the Steak Quesadilla Towers) and the Fire Pit Bacon Burger. I'm happy to report that they have given up any pretense of correct levels of doneness and gone instead to a 'pink' or 'no pink' policy. I'm assuming that their line chefs were incapable of determining the springiness of the meat through their latex gloves. -.5  I ordered the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne with a side Cesar salad. Although the dressing was obviously bottled (it's Applebees so expected. The Penne was nice flavor wise, but runny. The chicken was in truth, fairly well done.  The Ultimate Trio was eaten with no complaints, except that their 'Special Sauce' on the sliders, seems to be their Hot Wing sauce. Or at least, that's what came on ours.  The burger arrived overdone on one side, and barely done on the other. The onion slice was the end outer ring and still had a piece of skin on it. The fries had been made prior, and were limp and soggy. The bacon and sauce were flavorless. He said the sliders were better made and better seasoned. -1  All in all 3.5 but I'm rounding down to a 3 for the waitress acting like it was a big imposition for my partner to get Cherry Pepsi (they don't carry anything cherry from the fountain, so they usually make him a Roy Rogers at the bar)."}
{"text":"Not much to say. Like every other Applebee's across the usa. I am assuming that's the way it's planned; so all is consistant from one to the next. I've been brought there twice and certainly wouldn't go of my own accord. But, if you know what Applebee's is like in your town, this one is exactly like it, so at least you know what you're going to get. Hey, works for Mcbag!"}
{"text":"The service was so slow and awful, ordered and didn't see our waitress for 30 min. We finally got our salads (that were warm) and our drinks were empty but still didn't get a refill, had to go to the bar where I waited another 5 min to see someone. The manager was walking around talking to employees who wouldn't help our table at all, oh and there were 6 tables total in the restaurant.."}
{"text":"there was an ONION inside of a soda i was drinking. good job with the \"cleanliness\" applebees :) .. hadnt even recieved our food yet so i know it was not an onion from my plate."}
{"text":"Napa chicken and portabellos was excellent! A little too much red wine sauce but still spectacular. There will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"What a terrible place it has become. Slow service, short staffed, and very dirty. Left after waiting 20 minutes for service, after watching other people being frustrated with the lack of service. Terrible franchise owner, who only cares about profit margins."}
{"text":"Would give it a zero if that was an option. Will not ever eat here again. It used to be a great place to eat but new management changed it all. Waited 50 minutes for our order to be taken. Our party of eight was already seated and knew what we wanted but they only took the drink orders. We were told they were out of French fries when requested as part of the kids meal. The steak was brought raw so they took it back, cooked it, and served it on the exact same plate as the raw steak. Took three tries to finally get a steak that wasn't still moving and a clean plate. We were treating the kids to dessert because the kid's meals had incredibly tiny portions but after almost three hours there we went next door to Walmart to get dessert. While there we saw the general manager buying a cartload of generic frozen French fries. Definitely not worth the money or time spent."}
{"text":"Typical Applebee's which is no way a bad thing. We love coming here for the cheap margaritas during happy hour. The wings are not bad either."}
{"text":"I went with my mother and aunt for Applebee's Teacher Appreciation Day! They were serving free entrees for teachers with a valid school ID or pay-stub.  We got there pretty late in the day around 9:30 pm, so there wasn't really a wait. The place was probably half full, and for a Tuesday night, that's not bad. (Granted it was Happy Hour too though!)  We ordered up a spinach and artichoke dip appetizer which was pretty tasty. The chips were a bit over salted, but considering it was half price for appetizers I guess I can't complain.  They had a specially made menu for Teachers,  and all three of us decided to go with the 7 oz. Sirloin Steak with the option of mashed potatoes or baked potato, and vegetables. I didn't expect much since Applebee's isn't exactly well known for their steaks, and so I wasn't too disappointed to find that my steak was cooked kinda funny, the veggies were mediocre, and the mashed potatoes kinda cold. Their baked potato (which I sampled from my mother's plate) was pretty tasty though as well as the cherry limeade. The baked apple pie dessert with ice cream was pretty darned tasty though!  I think the best part of the night, which is also why I chose to give three stars instead of two was the service. Typically, three Asian women, on a FREE Teacher's Day meal, probably doesn't scream of \"hey we tip well!!!\" I've actually been to some restaurants where service wasn't that most likely because of the notoriety of Asians as being bad tippers. However, service here was great! Our server came and took our orders promptly, was kind about waiting for my mother and aunt to decide what they wanted to drink (water, which again doesn't scream of good tips) and eat. Made sure our beverage glasses were always full, and was very kind and courteous.   Our whole meal ended up just being shy of $15, but we tipped our server well because she deserved it!  So in a nutshell... wait: not long, but we came late food: OK. cherry limeade was tasty, and dessert was tasty service: great!"}
{"text":"APPLEBEE'S HAS RATS!!!  I was trying to enjoy a celebratory dinner with my Son, grand kids & my ex-wife bit couldn't even do that! my order was wrong! I SPECIFICALLY asked for no onions on my bourbon steak & the waitress kept arguing back n' forth with me that I didnt!  & thats when I went to dig in to my Cobb Salad & found a WHOLE RAT in my salad! Feces & everything! No wonder the damn Ninja Turtles couldn't find Master Splinter..   Stay far away from this or any Applebee's as they certainly aren't up to food standards"}
{"text":"Decided on this location because it seemed like all the others had equally bad reviews and this one was close. I had a gift card I needed to use so went for a drink and appetizers. Interesting place.... The staff was friendly enough but seemed clueless when it came to customer service. Our waitress commented on how cute my children were (when she finally figured out we were in her section) and then went into a long story about her own kids... Forgot to provide us with plates to dish up the appetizers. The Bahamas Mama drink was really good... The appetizers were not. If you go in expecting unhealthy, over-processed, greasy bar type food you will not be disappointed. I would recommend this place for happy hour."}
{"text":"First thing's first. Fuck. Applebee's.  It took way too long to get my FUCKING tenders. tenders. never coming back to such an awful establishment. This ruined me and my family's night. unbelievable.  Todd McDoodle"}
{"text":"I have had better service at a fast food restaurants! My family waited over 30 min before we were asked what we wanted to drink, drinks took 20 min to get. Meanwhile there was several other tables being served by the same waiters and getting there food orders. On top of that we heard the manager giving other tables free appetizers saying they were on him because of the people having to wait. Manager never once stopped at are table. We should have just walked out. Lesson learn. Applebee's has some of the worse service! This is the third one we have been to and never again will we eat at one."}
{"text":"Did not have handicap ready because of big party, although they made accomidations quickly for my grandmother. P.S. the food here is delicious."}
{"text":"Ok we are returning here slowly each time. We stopped coming here for awhile because the food was not up to par. I can say that this has changed! YES! I don't know if they have a new cook or management has stepped up but the food has never been better. Welcome back neighbor!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location after work for hockey games or football games...but they hired new kitchen help or something because the food went downhill.   It's been about a year and a half and I decided to give them another try as I had an hour to waste before work.  I ordered the chicken won ton tacos and boneless Buffalo wings.  Simple I know...but like I said I only had an hour.   They switched up their menu so maybe I'll make a trip back to try something else. Chicken fijitas were my go to and they got rid of them. Boo hiss.   But anyway, my server was excellent and the apps I ordered were much better this time than the last couple times I was there. So that's always a good thing.   I'll visit again and hopefully everything will be just as good, if not better."}
{"text":"Good is good but service at this location sucks. I always order to go and have to come in to get my food and always have to wait longer than estimated."}
{"text":"Let's be clear...  This is APPLEBEES so don't expect too much.  With that said, 9.99 for unlimited chicken fingers and fries or 11.99 for unlimited riblets and fries is amazing.  And don't you dare try telling me the fries aren't delicious.  This place has the classic problem of Cleveland turnover so everyone who works there is really nice since they've probably not been on the job for more than a month or two.  As a result, they actually seem to try most of the time.  Last time I was there the hostess told us her name and declared herself our \"seat sitter\"...  who does that?  Location is a big bonus for this site, given its proximity to down town and ample parking.  Overall you pretty much get what you expect.  Classic corporate american food...  big portions and cheap prices."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for 4yrs for a good reason. Sadly, nothing's changed except the decor. We quit going because the service was worse than terrible.      Today the service was good. Food was fair. Dishes were very dirty. Hair was found in the food. Sadly I'm the one who suggested giving it another try.     The mgr Tommy came out and apologized. He was very pleasant. Waitress (Trista?) Was very good.  They are the only reason for the second star.   I can't blame the waitress for dirty dishes. I didn't look at the reviews until leaving. If there are this many complaints about dirty dishes, you'd think they'd change something.  I never ask for or expect a comped meal. But I do expect to get what I pay for. We were disappointed for the last time."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Applebees for their beer on tap. Their beer is still really good and reasonably priced, but that would be my only reason for ever going back here!  Applebees has changed their menu since I've last been here. They raised their prices and cut back their portions. My husband ordered a burger which was $11 and subpar. Red Robin has the same tasting hamburgers but charges less.   This restaurant charges $2.50 just to swap out french fries for onion rings. They also had these game systems on the tables. You can play trivia and other games while you wait but each game adds .99 cents onto your bill. .99 cents isn't a lot of money but why add to your bill to play a game when you should be socializing with who you are out to dinner with anyways??  It's just really petty to charge extra for stupid little things. Especially when the food and atmosphere is not that great at all."}
{"text":"I have eaten there on several occasions, and for the vast majority of times it has been a great place. Good food good service.  On one occasion, I had a bad experience with the food, but to the credit of the server it was taken care of right away, and the meal was comped.   Best restaurant in that mall area. Good place to go for a pre or post movie meal and drinks.  Place is not going to win top chef awards, but the food is generally good."}
{"text":"Well the drinks were great but i perfer my glass to stay full rather than wait. The salsa verdre brisket nacho only had 3 chips with meat on them. Very disappointed. But the sever amanda was very sweet.been here a few times my experience was ALRIGHT."}
{"text":"Ricardo is very very slowww... short Hispanic male, kinda balding....  Food was amazing as always though ! 2 for 25 is delicious and cheap!"}
{"text":"I wasn't token care of properly and I feel this way because no one greeted me and my boyfriend and took them a while to bring in the food and my cup wasn't refilled and I had plates that were not being taken away so my table can be clean while I enjoyed the rest of my meal. I had to speak to the manager."}
{"text":"Tacky and unfriendly atmosphere. Every server and employee (besides the annoyingly over-friendly hostess) seemed to be on the cusp of giving into their suicidal urges. Can't help but think \"Shenanigans\" from the movie \"Waiting\". Managerial staff attempts a fake niceness that is half ass-ed and transparent. Food was highly mediocre and seemed to be made from very cheap ingredients. If you were planning on eating at a chain like this, the \"Chili's\" on Mill Ave & University is an infinitely better bet (still an average place, but with a better atmosphere and better service)."}
{"text":"Went here again and they were closed 35 minutes early. All chairs were already stacked. Knocked on the door and someone came out. I asked why they were closed so early and he said \"you guys would be the only ones here\" and did not serve us. Called management the next day and explained what happened and the manager said if they were not making more money than they were spending they would close. I told him that the restaurant either needs to stay open until their posted hours so people aren't driving 25 minutes to a closed restaurant (what happened to me and my girlfriend) or to close earlier. I then asked if I could have the number of whoever was higher up and he hung up on me. I really hope someone finds out about this. It's unacceptable."}
{"text":"We walked into the restaurant about 9:30 pm the hostess sat us after about standing in the foyer for about two minutes. We sat down while 3 or 4 different waiters/waitresses walked past our table not acknowledging us at all. We waited for 12 minutes still nothing we got up and walked out but before we walked out the hostess that sat us had the nerve to tell us have a nice night. What? As if you don't remember just seating us. This will be our last time going to this applebees."}
{"text":"Was here for my daughter's birthday. It was her choice. I knew it would be bad from the get go. No hostess and had to wait almost 10 minutes to get seated in a restaurant with 8 people total! Then after getting seated our server showed up took our drink order and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We placed our appetizer and entr√©e order. 15 minutes later our entr√©es showed up before our appetizers.  My burger was over cooked and fries were stale like they had been sitting. Just overall very disappointing. I probably won't be going there again"}
{"text":"I called right after I left to claim glasses I forgot, when I go back they lie and tell me they would reimburse if not found because they were in their possession. I called the franchise manager and he was extremely rude.. I used to come to this location almost twice a week and I will never return . I thought a large business would care more about making their customers happy than arguing over 300.00 glasses. SMH I will continue to leave poor reviews on ever site I know and write to corporate! Absolutely Terrible!"}
{"text":"Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated.  Would be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour, appetizers and a drink both were delicious! Rose is a great waitress, very friendly and personable. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Who ever choose their red wine needs to get a drivers license first Terrible selection for place with a bar Please ask for help if you don't know a subject"}
{"text":"I always managed to feel sick after eating here, so I stopped going except for happy hour after work and maybe fries to eat.  Service varies. We had great service at first, and then it went downhill and we stopped going so much.  I might try another location, but it's not likely."}
{"text":"New employee Daquan was super enthusiastic and helpful. We all thought he is headed into manager training program"}
{"text":"It has been at least 3 years since we have eaten at an Applebee's, now we remember why. The service was almost okay but the Dinner its self was bad. My husband received half of his meal to start, missing potatoes. The shrimp on the Bourbon Street Shrimp & Chicken were served under cooked. Luckily, by scraping the shrimp on to the sizzling metal plate, I cooked them myself. The mixed vegetables served with the (very light) 7 oz sirloin were \"slightly\" warm and very crunchy, not by request. Like maybe the vegetables were a little close to the flame, but never actually cooked. The steak was well done as opposed to the requested medium rare. The kitchen staff is hosing over the wait staff. I would go to any other similar chain restaurant before ever going back to the Applebee's on Craig Road in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Applebee's Food but this place disappoints me.. Lack of staff, slow service.. /sigh"}
{"text":"The service sucks here, my drink is so strong and my friends steak is terrible. An hour waiting for her steak! And it's disgusting! Wtf hire new people."}
{"text":"We came to Applebee's tonight because we had a gift card and it sounded good. But the food has been better other times we have come here. We've had better service than tonight too. There was a 15-20min wait, so we looked at the menu and ordered our food when we got our seats/booth, which helped get our food faster. We aren't really happy with our waitress. We were neglected. She forgot 1 water when we ordered our drinks, she never gave us a refill until we had to ask after the empty glasses sat out on the end of our table for 15 mins as she kept walking by for other tables. I asked for a few to-go boxes, she gave us 1. We had to ask the manager for another. We weren't given extra napkins and didn't see her around to ask for some before it was too late and we were done eating. Our table was piled up with dirty dishes and empty glasses while we were still eating and we had no room. The food was alright. The boneless wings were hard and small, which was very disappointing. The chips were all weird/hard and stuck together. The mozzarella sticks were good. The dessert (triple chocolate meltdown) was really good like always. Overall, I have a full tummy but I'm not that satisfied with our experience tonight."}
{"text":"I went out on a date with my guy here on a.Friday Night.and let me tell you i review toilet paper before i buy it..so i definitely reviewed this place and A majority of them where BAD but decided to go anyway it's in my neighborhood and I wasn't about to change my strategically planned plans lol...Plus I could Yelp about it later...I must say I was impressed I had a GREAT time My server was Nice and Attentive she was on point 100 percent I didn't have not a One complaint and for me That like Never Ever happens the place was packed but the wait was short The Food was Great we partook in the 2fer $20 they have some better options for 2fer $25 and that's what we had My Four Cheese macaroni came with these awesome sweet and Tangy Chicken strips Mmmmm Good...place was Mostly Clean...Bathroom was Gross though..but I take My Sanitizer with me Always you never know where you might need that stuff...They had Really Cool games you can play right at Your Table by tablet and I loved How U could pay and tip at the table as well so no staring Eyes when u Dont Tip or leave a small one there's No.ridicule No waiting..No BS..This place was AWESOME.."}
{"text":"Sitting for 15 minutes and nobody is assisting us. Very disappointing coz the Applebee's in lincolnwood chicago gives a very good service."}
{"text":"Poor service! The food however, is great! I suggest calling your order in and picking it up. You will receive better service, avoid the wait and avoid the inattentive/unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Saturday with G money.  The host was pretty cool in finding us a table around the bar so we didn't have to go up and down any steps. Our server, Alysha (sp?) was one of the best servers I think I've ever had. If you've ever been to Applebees before you know the menu is pretty standard, but with a few cool dishes thrown in. The drink menu also has some nice looking selections on it. I'm not totally crazy about fruity drinks but the red apple sangria looked and sounded good. If I wasn't with my grandma who I still kind of feel awkard drinking around, I probably would of tried one.    We did the 2 for 20 because thats one of the best deals in town right now. The potato twists (i think thats what they are called) came out first. I love homemade potato chips but these were a little overdone. Some of the chips were a nice golden color, but many looked burnt. The queso blanco was pretty good that came with it.  Then she got the chicken finger basket and I got an oriental salad. It came with some kind of dressing and Alysha noticed that I didn't care for it so I asked for the teriyaki based one instead, much better. Everything in the salad was good, especially the grilled chicken. It was so big I didn't finish it, and I can eat pretty good tbh. She liked her chicken fingers and we declined dessert even though the blondie looked amazing. I just hate getting dessert at restaurants because they are so overpriced imo.  I'll probably be back to try their happy hour because of the cheap drinks and half price appetizers they had advertised on the table."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Mozzarella sticks were barely warm.  Waitress kindly brought out a fresh order.  I had double crunch shrimp as an entree.  Honestly, I've gotten better quality shrimp from my local grocery store's frozen food dept.  The coleslaw served with it was literally inedible.  Little to no dressing and tasteless.  Service was good though!"}
{"text":"Took my family to go eat. Ordered boneless chicken wings and was served celery with mold on it. In doing some research it takes about 4 to 5 days for mold to grow on celery. That means that they left the food out for that long. It also tells me that the storage of food isnt done properly. When I told the manager literally not making this up the manager response was \"oh ok.\" Needless to say we left. Oh I failed to mention the waitress who served us our drinks was coughing on her hands and rubbing her nose as well."}
{"text":"Stop in on a Sunday to have a nice lunch, and everything was as expected.  Applebee's is your typical casual restaurant with nothing fancy, which is one aspect I really enjoy. The food is good with fair pricing. My companion and I chose the 2 for $25. We got hot boneless wings for the appetizer, she got the Bourbon street chicken and shrimp with fries, and I ordered the half rack baby back ribs with garlic mash potatoes and garlicky green beans . Everything was quite flavorful and I was happy with the outcome. The wings were crispy, ribs were soft, mash potatoes and green beans had a nice garlic touch with I loved. However, I must note that my friend's chicken and shrimp did look a little \"sad\" for presentation (see picture).  One thing I was really surprised about was the service here at Applebee's. It took us a while to get our drinks and orders in; however, I was not at all upset with the service. Our waiter, Arkeisha, was swamped with customers, but continued to give everyone a warm, kind smile. She made my trip to Applebee's so much more enjoyable to see her with such optimism!   All in all, this place is an average restaurant I was quite impressed with."}
{"text":"Started off with filthy plates for our apps Ordered the brunch burger  Soggy oily disgusting burger  Patty fell apart before I even had a chance to take a bite  My lady had the Chinese chicken salad  Lettuce was soggy , chicken was over cooked  We should have noticed that the place empty at 2pm on a Saturday  It was a reminder why you should never just go to eat someplace because it's close to where you are shopping  Never again  Overall food was poop  Service was a 5"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times. Great service, great people for the sit down. The car side to go? Not so much. Very slow, I've waited 15 minutes past pick up time during a slow part of the day."}
{"text":"Why so many bad reviews!  I've had most of the items on the menu. The happy hour is awesome, too bad there's no happy hour on Saturdays, thats really lame.   Other than that, the service is always great, hostesses and waiters are always friendly no matter how intoxicated our crowd is. The boneless wings are tasty and spicy and the artichoke dip is good with anything.   Dont get Bahama Mama's or you will be called a wuss, forever. Long Island Iced Tea's are ok and the prices on beer are decent. For a while they had 2 for 1 shots of Patron....ah that was great. Contrary to popular belief, Patron and mozarella sticks DO mix."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Applebee's experience ever, with 2 parents who were visiting from another country, they often look forward to visiting applebees and have been doing so for yeara, this is the first time we went to this establishment and last, the service was horrid, our servers were very rude, furthermore had to return our steak as it was not grilled to request,  and usually a manager will come by and confirm, there was no manager , or so I was told, what's worst is my mash potatos had a HAIR , a HAIR,...and not a single apology was offered or anything ,basically the plate went away and another plate came, obviously we didn't eat the mash potatoes for fear that the PUBIC HAIR was merely brushed aside, it is likely I will visit other applebees in the future but never this one"}
{"text":"Worst establishment I have ever been to. First off the service was very poor. Our waitress finally got my drink order right after 2 attempts. Who knew a water with lemon was so difficult to make? After that, I found a hair in my salad and when they brought me a new salad I opened up my silverware and the knife was filthy! Looked like it still had bbq sauce on it and it was stuck to the napkin it was wrapped in!!! Totally unacceptable. At that point I not only decided my family and I weren't eating dinner there that night, but I wanted to hear what the manager had to say about the situation. What I got was a weak apology and he then offers me a $15 gift certificate for my troubles. I would have given it 0 stars if I could have. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Tequila chicken and Shrimp was delicious. Wasn't crowded, but was Wednesday night. Right in and seated right away"}
{"text":"My family of 4 came on on a Friday nite, got seated right away, great food, great drink, and it didn't break the bank. Can't ask for anymore."}
{"text":"I stop here every once in awhile on the way home from work for a beer maybe some food. Nobody goes to Applebee's for food (I hope) so I will stick with service. It was about 9:45 on a Friday night so it was a little busy but there were two bartenders behind the bar which is unusual for this Applebee's. The one that unfortunately helped me was either new or just didnt give a shit. His name was Aaron. I was annoyed because you should never sit a bar for 10 minutes before being greeted, I almost just left but then Aaron decided to help. I ordered a jack and coke. He walked around the bar a bit, then walked out of bar area and I didnt see him for a few minutes. When he did come back it was obvious he had forgotten my drink but he made it quickly and I was happy. Long story short I had to ask for another drink after being empty for a bit, just poor service. I gave 3 stars because I come here fairly often and this is not typical. I would just ask for another server/bartender if a guy named aaron walks up. He doesnt care, dont even give him a chance. Btw when I asked for my second drink he washed a few glasses before making my drink, bad. Im listening to another couple complaining about him as I type this."}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes for our server to greet us and/or take our drink orders. We got fed up waiting as at least 3 servers who past us back and forth multiple times and we've yet to be greeted. It wasn't even busy or full and we were sitting there waiting for our server to come by. By the end of 10 minutes of waiting since we sat down we knew what drink and what food to order but another 10 minutes went by with no one acknowledging us and we got fed up with it. But the servers apparently had enough time to visit other guests and chat with them. This is not the first time we've had awful service and long wait times but at least we were greeted briefly but apparently even with new management and people it is still slow and terrible service. Go to the Lake Mead/rainbow in Summerlin or the one in Henderson location. You'll get better service than the Fort Apache/Tropicana!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a very enjoyable night. Food came in a timely manner and our waiter, Eric, was great! He filled out cups before they were empty, he checked constantly on us and was just the perfect waiter!"}
{"text":"Ordered online to Pick up on lunch break. Didn't include a tip because it was a pick up order not dine in. Had to call for landmark... knew the location but didn't have GPS on. Talked to Jess. I gave a $2 tip for her assistance by phone with landmark and mentioned that but she seemed upset that a tip wasn't included with purchase and made sure I knew when she said \"we have to put the food in the bag ...  it doesn't get there by itself\". I was in a hurry so didn't respond that it was her job in which she was already being paid for. I am a great tipper always doing more than the 18%, Jess felt owed something and I  didn't really like that. I always visit Applebee's on the west side of Madison  ... better service, better cooks. Probably will completely avoid the east side location. Its been 2 years since I've been there & the last time the cook was bad & served several customers bad food. My steak was spoiled and 2 tables next to ours also got refunded meals because something was wrong with theirs. 2 years later,  a priveledged worker who requires a tip for a pick up order. Whoa! No more Applebee's East side/Madison for me. You can keep it. No thanks! Shout out to the new chef ....  the food was good. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars. News flash Jess... all you do is put the food in the bag for pick up orders and you get a base pay working there in addition to tips you collect, when waitressing. You should have been happy with the $2 tip that was on top of your base pay. Really!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. It smells like mildew. They gave us the wrong order... 3 times. Gave us the a bill for wrong table, for $90 instead of $40. Then our bill had a $2 charge for games that we did not play. Arrived in a great mood, coming from a good time. Left hungry and frustrated. Will not come here again."}
{"text":"Fast service and always nice staff good food and they love us veterans!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst chain in America. Applebee's is proof that the American education system is failing. You know why? Cause people are actually paying to eat here! I don't care how \"convenient\" it is. I don't care how mainstream it is. Applebee's should be the national symbol of inferior quality and American degradation.  First off, the food is either frozen or canned. Nothing tastes like it was prepared that day (or that decade for that matter). Applebee's and its followers will throw out the \"consistency\" excuse, which is \"the food is supposed to taste the same at every location\" to justify the over-priced disgustingness. Truth: Applebee's sides are nothing more than those Green Giant vegetable boxes in the frozen food isle that cost $2 (or $1 on sale).  Second, the service is TERRIBLE. I got a spicy chicken pasta that took 45 minutes to be served! 45 minutes! No exaggeration. I quite honestly think I could have made pasta from scratch faster than that. My girlfriend had a sandwich with a side of broccoli, and the broccoli was cold. She sent it back and got a new one, which turned out to be lukewarm. All-in-all it took about an hour and a half to get out of there, and it wasn't even crowded.  Don't even bother with the 2 for $20 deal either. I tried that disaster about a year ago. I got a steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The steak was clearly pre-grilled, frozen, then microwaved. I could see them having a sign on the wall in the kitchen saying: \"for a rare steak, nuke it for 2 minutes; for a well-done steak, nuke it for 5 minutes\". The mashed potatoes had a hard, gelatinous crust on top (sort of like pudding skin), and the vegetables were mediocre.  I've probably eaten at Applebee's four to five times in the past 5 years, yet never of my own volition. It seems to be the first place people choose to go when they can't think of anywhere else, especially with a group from work. My advice: Don't buy into the peer pressure, stay as far away as possible. Be the levelheaded person of the group and suggest going to a REAL restaurant.  1 Star because I didn't get food poisoning. -4 Stars for poor service, price, and food quality."}
{"text":"I came in with my wife and two children on my birthday, June 26th.  The hostess sat a party that came in after us, and would have Sat another if my wife hadn't spoken up.  We waiting almost 15 minutes for our drinks, and almost 45 minutes for our food.  All we ordered were fryer items and a medium rare steak.  When the steak came it was only a few degrees away from being well done, hardly any pink at all and the baked potato was cold.  All the other food was great!  I brought the issues up to the manager and he was so kind and professional.   He cut our bill almost in half.  I was pleased with his attention and caring for customers.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Table 13 check #8267975366 First The good. The waitress was wonderful. Now the bad. The food wasn't all that great. The chicken  crispers were hard. My aunt and my guy ordered the all you can eat riblets. My guy opened his napkin which had the silverware in it and a gift. There was a small white bug crawling on the knife. My guy showed it to the hostess. The hostess showed the bug to the manager. The manager came over to our table with a very very offensive statement saying \"I heard you brought one of your friends from home\" and he laughed. I looked at the manager and I looked at my guy his face must have changed three shades of black! I was so proud of my guy his normal reaction is to curse the manager out  however, he just looked At the manager and said \"no sir, I did not bring that from home and the manager said it was a joke. Well, we did not think it was funny and highly unprofessional. Even though the food was horrible, the service  was great the only good thing was my guy got his meal free but only after my Aunt made that request. This was our first experience eating at an Applebee's. We will never return. Just so disappointed in the manager."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. We order drinks when we sat down 10 minutes later my husband got up to go to the bar was still sitting in the the reader and they had not filled it. The manager brought it to the table. Then while we were sitting 25 minutes waiting for our food we noticed another customer at the bar trying three times to get the manager and the bartenders attention by waving. They didn't give her the time of day we had to flag him down and get their attention so that they would pay attention to the people at the bar. Are food came 25 minutes later. And yep you guessed it it wasn't correct. We had asked for water didn't get it another girl came by and asked if she could remove my cup I said no I would like some water please she said all will let me just take it and I'll bring you another glass of water over 10 minutes later she brings me a glass of water. We had to ask for our bill so we could go and when we got it I walked over to the manager and let her know that I felt that the service was inadequate and she said oh you're the one that had to weigh me down she fully acknowledge that she had to be waived down to serve a customer she didn't offer to pay for our meal she just apologized to pick up our bill and Cassius out. Way to go Sally that's great customer service we will not be back"}

This restaurant is extremely clean and well maintained, the GM of this location really has it together. The food is actually better than other Applebee's too. It always comes out warm and fresh.  But what keeps me coming back is   DJ. I cannot say enough how incredible the service is here."}

{"text":"The wings were tiny, expensive, and oversauced, my triple bacon burger came with two pieces of bacon, and the nachos came out cold. Overall, the food is horrible."}
{"text":"The service here was great the first times we came, but now it's terrible. There is only one person serving customers, and the others, are standing around, talking, and watching TV. Just go somewhere else, save money, and hours of time that you are wasting waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here with my family, service was great.  Server was very helpful with food choices and even brought out some free samples of their new apps and desserts!"}

{"text":"If expecting carside to go don't count on it.  I waited 20 minutes before going inside and finding out my order was ready. They asked for the type of vehicle I drove and the color and last time I ordered online I went for just to go and they didn't ask that question. I waited there and they never showed up so I went inside to get my food and it took them 2 minutes to get it. Seriously I asked for Carside to go and they don't even apologize. I still like Applebee's but the chances of me coming back to this one is a No."}
{"text":"Walked and told the hostess we were going to the bar so we sat at one of the free standing tables around the lowered bar area.   There were 5 of 8 tables open at 3:45 on this Sunday.  Hostess (Kayliegh) came over to say \"that for future reference\"  that these tables are not part of the bar and would want to make sure they are clean. Felt like we were being scolded for having self-chosen that table without permission. First time here.  Not a good impression. Server did great!"}
{"text":"Rude bartender slow service.   I noticed that the bartenders were serving others and ignoring me.   We had to ask for our check 3 times.  We could have just walked out without paying."}
{"text":"I actually didn't think I would have anything bad to say about my experience yesterday because everything was pretty normal for eating out on a Thursday evening. It wasn't until this evening (Friday) when I decided to have my leftover pasta for dinner that I was turned off of this Applebee's location. When I started eating, I bit into something that was hard, not crunchy hard, but rock-hard. (It's hard to bite and just turns into smaller, grittier pieces - doesn't actually go away.) I actually did experience this when I dined in on Thursday but thought it was just something weird/random, turns out, it's not. The entire leftover half of my pasta has these hard little rocky pieces that feel like gravel mixed throughout it. At first I thought I could just pick around it or something, but apparently not. It's way too much of it to go around and I can barely tell the difference between what's seasoning or not. I actually wish I had found it while I was there so I could tell someone and have them explain it to me. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I recently went to this restaurant to celebrate my coworkers birthday. I have never had any problems with Applebee's; however, this particular time, I ordered the shrimp and spinach salad and found some type of plastic in my salad. Both the manager and waitress apologized for the incident and were very quick to fix the problem. I was offered a new salad (which I took to go because my coworkers had finished their meal already) and when the food was brought out to me, the manager came back again to apologize. My meal was also free. I gave them a 3 because of how both the manager and waitress quickly fixed the problem. I don't think it was their fault but rather the fault of the cooks who were preparing the foods. My salad was also very good!"}
{"text":"Ok so I went to this place tonight and was not very happy 45 min to get my food and then it's wrong it would have been ok if it wasn't my child's order that was wrong then to top it all off my waitress leaves does not tell us so for 20-more mins goes by and no waitress so I ask some one and he tells me he was left to Handel us ok so wear is the customer respect level can't go to the table and tell us. Then I ask for the manager and it seemed like it really wasn't a big deal if I could I wouldn't not have put any stars so  thanks for a horrible dinner and for the horrible service will not return"}
{"text":"Came here with our 2 kids for Father's day. The waitress was short and rude from the start. 4 tables who came in after us got their food before us. We did speak with the manager and they did give us our meal, however there was very little aplogy. On top of waiting so long for our food it was cold when we got it and our 3 year old had been in there too long. Very upset for my husband for the awful service.  Will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"Thank you, Manager Frank, for covering our entire bill yesterday, including beverages, after our order got lost and we waited a long time for our food. The food was good, too. Try the new grilled chicken and honey pepper shrimp over cubed potatoes and green beans!"}
{"text":"This was without a doubt the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. The hostess wouldn't look at us. It's 112 degrees outside and it took our waitress 15 minutes to bring waters. My girlfriend ordered a Thai shrimp Salad.( It came with no shrimp)I ordered the honey pepper chicken pasta. Except they brought me a heaping bowl of elbow noodles with 3 over fried pieces of chicken the size of my pinky. The chicken was very small and rock hard. We informed the waitress that our orders were wrong. She left and never came back. I gave this restaurant 1 star because the doors worked well when I needed to leave. Vegas has no class and to further it's classes existence this aplebees helped it mutate into a new level of bad. I keep my words in the vernacular so the people that just dissed me can understand my review."}

{"text":"We ordered steak and mine was ordered rare but came to table medium. They fixed it and gave a new complete meal with a rare steak. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you expect anything other than Applebee's, you will most likely be disappointed. Unless what you are expecting is Applebee's with more salt, more bad jokes, and a more disgruntled staff, hiding their hatred, who would rather be doing anything else.   This location is a convenience stop for me. I would never go out of my way to visit this store - if there is one even a mile or two further away, try there first.  That said, the bar is secluded and sits at one end of the restaurant, away from. If you're looking to chat with a bartender about your favorite team, you might find yourself eatin' good in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch around 3:30 and the place was not busy as expected. The food was excellent but the service lacked a little. Not the server herself, she was pleasant but the food delivery. I ordered the Clubhouse Grill (which was very tasty) that comes with fries but the fries didn't arrive till after I was done with the sandwich. They had just ran out of fries, she said. My question is why would you bring out any of the food if everything wasn't ready. On the bright side, the fries were hot and delicious when I finally got them."}
{"text":"Just not a pleasant experience and the worst customer service I have received. The hostess held the door open, didn't say anything however, but luckily my colleague and I were bright enough to figure out we were supposed to follow her. We sit down and are greeted by the server. I order a Pepsi, and I either got diet by mistake or the syrup was running low. I inform him and  he brings another, but after tasting this one it is clear something's amiss with the Pepsi, so I order a Mtn. Dew instead. We also place our food order now, appetizer and two All-In burger packages. There were four tables already seated when we got there and now 3-4 others had arrived. So we waited around 25 minutes total for food, which came out together. Rather than say, the appetizer after 10 min and the burgers at 25. The food was alright i guess that's the reason for the one star. The 4 other tables all had appetizers before we had our food though, and after the Pepsi situation we didn't even get an offer for a drink refill until after our meal. The All-in burgers feature fry refills on the menu, but only upon request were we told that there was an extra fee. Then it comes time to pay, after more waiting. I see my server, but he's elsewhere. He brings me a check presenter with a slot. I put my card in it and wait. He comes back and asks me to slide him the device sitting on the the table, at which point he slides my card, and then has me finish the authorization and tip. Why did you bring me a check presenter with a receipt if I can use the device. And then instead of showing me or telling me about it, you make me slide it to you. Oh. So, I didn't have to wait 20 more minutes for you to bring me the bill?? I used to love Applebee's but the service just wasn't very good the last few times, luckily the food was. I'm a generous tipper, I'll tip drive-thru workers if they give me solid service. This guy got no tip, because he didn't put in the effort at our table to earn one."}
{"text":"Holly Hell I have to say Kayla who works at the bar is the best bartender/waitress I've had the pleasure of meeting if a long tim, she was very pleasant and everything was perfect from adding her own LOVING touch to our drinks, with personal flare the drinks all tasted as if they were made with just our individual taste in mind. Our food was perfect with no complaints. Please check out the Applebee's on Eastern and Coronado center. Kayla will hook you up.  Thank you for being so sweet and taking such good care of us and making my grandma feel special."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Applebee's in quite awhile before this evening.  Now I remember why.  Ordered a steak medium well and got medium to medium rare.  Steak was not hot, but the plate was.  Upon leaving there were piles of dirty plates on the high top behind the check in stand and dishes to be picked up on multiple tables.  Saw no management to speak to.  They have been walking around all the time in the past.  Won't be back until things change for the better."}
{"text":"The food and service is always excellent at this Applebee's!  My favorite is the Bourbon Steak & Shrimp.  Also try their signature Mudslides - top notch."}
{"text":"Just came in for some quick dinner and the place was packed.  Sat at the bar with the bar tender DJ - what can I say??? Absolutely amazing!!!! Not only did she have a full bar she also had 7 tables and everyone was blown away by her service.  I manage a bar/restaurant on the strip and so wanted to take her with me but she seemed super happy doing her job - Dj if you read this look me up for a job anytime!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, the new menu is great, the new attire is awesome, the maple pecan sweet mashed patoato is out of this world, Ross was too cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the wife. The place was deserted.   We ordered the 2 for $20 deal, which is an appetizer to share and 2 entrees. We had our drink order taken immediately and we were served our drinks quickly.   We waited about 35 or 40 minutes after getting our drinks with no food. I asked the server where the food was and she went into the back. When she didn't return after another 5 minutes, I saw the manager. I asked her if the kitchen was actually open or not. She looked surprised. I let her know that we had been waiting 40 minutes by that point. She promised a resolution and went into the kitchen.  After about 8 minutes, they delivered an order of Mozzarella Sticks to our table as our appetizer. The problem was that we didn't order that. We had ordered chicken wings. They left the Mozz sticks anyways and then went back into the kitchen.   It was about 60 minutes from the time we were seated to when the appetizer and entrees we had ordered actually appeared at our table.  The manager came by to apologize. There was no explanation offered. And we got $5 taken off the check.  There are at least 20-30 other places for lunch within 3 miles of this place. I'd make this your last choice of all of them. Try the Spicy Pickle on Eastern and St Rose instead. There's also a Five Guys Burgers and a Chipotle."}
{"text":"6th time. 1st time horrible meal. Brought wrong order to guest, my pork chop was cooked 2 death. Not edible . Did not comp my dish. I just wanted the cook to use an instant-read thermometer so hopefully the next guest would not get screwed."}
{"text":"Love coming to this Applebee's on Power and Ray because the food is great for a chain restaurant and the staff is always nice.   I recently tried one of their new Under 600 calorie dishes. Let me just say, you have to try the Cedar Lemon Chicken. The chicken was so tender and it came with diced cucumbers and green apples on top with a light lemon sauce. The rice was a blend of white rice, quinoa (not sure I spelled that right) cranberries, and pecans! YUM!!! Think I found my new favorite dish. :)"}

{"text":"I arrived at Applebee's starving.  The hunger was like death knocking at my chamber door.  I looked frantically for a hostess, but she was busy sweeping the carpet with a broom.   After being seated, I was alarmed by the poor design of the menu.   It was loud and distracting.  The soup was bad.  Our steaks did not match the picture; the check didn't match the picture.  Overall : disappointed."}
{"text":"I like Applebee's but I'll go to a different location next time.   The food was not up to the level of other Applebee's I've been to.  There was no host at the door greeting us, it took too long to get noticed and seated.   The food, when it came out didn't look anything like on the menu.   Couldn't finish the sandwich because the bun as hard.  The enchiladas had been sitting a while, as evidenced by the crust on the melted sour cream."}
{"text":"Walked in just now put our name in for 4. We waited by the hostess podium and my father-in-law looked up and there is a cockroach the size of a pocket knife crawling on the ceiling. Do not eat here unless you ask if they have taken care of their bug problem."}
{"text":"The hostess are terrible and need to work on their customer service skills, our waitress did the bare minimum and the food left something to be desired. This is the second bad experience at this location. I will not be coming back"}

There have been times I literally waited 1 1/2 hrs for my food. The staff is snotty and managers don't care. I have waited so long the I just left without anything. Don't waist your time or money!!!"}
{"text":"Should be a -5 (minus) star. A complete waste of money. Never, ever, have I seen such a disgraceful presentation of a 1/2 rack of ribs in my frikin entire life. You should be ashamed of putting that on a plate to serve to a customer. I feed my Toy Chihuahua bigger portions. Looking at the size of the ribs were compared to what my dogs ribs looked like. Funny my dogs ribs had more meat.  Mr District Manager, you need to check whats going out on the plates. If you sitdown and order this meal, you would be just as disappointed as my wife and I were. Both of us being in the restaurant business for a total of 80 years combined, cooking and managerial,  we know if you wouldn't eat it, don't serve it. Your people need to take ownership and speak up when they see something wrong. I just cant believe this was allowed to be served. It looks like it was boiled all night and then re-heated in microwave. It was as tough as jerky. Shame, shame, shame on you. The funny thing about this ordeal is that I made the mistake. I was supposed to go to Chili's for the ribs which looked good on tv, and I mixed up the names and went to you guys. Never again."}

{"text":"Came here with my kids for lunch, had the 9oz steak with loaded mash potatoes.  It was perfect.  No complaints.  My oldest had the Mac and cheese with chicken tenders. He liked it but it had a weird \"sweet\" taste towards the end.  My youngest had the 2 cheeseburger and fries dish from the kids menu.  The meat was small but tasty.  Overall had a good experience with good customer service.  The Manager here makes it a point to go around and make sure that all is well."}
{"text":"They have excellent customer service. Bruno and Jody are great! They go beyond what they have to. The food here is alway hot and tastes good. My girlfriends and I enjoy happy hour here and will continue too!"}
{"text":"Did not suit my needs. Quanity-mediocre, quality-NEEDS improvement. OVERALL 4/10. Service needs improvement, and on top of that the time it took to get the food was more than ok."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude from the waitstaff. Walked in, sat down, had the specials rushed past us, and received an eye roll and exasperated sigh from the waiter when we asked for a minute to look over the drink menu. We promptly got up and left following that exchange. Definitely did not feel welcome at all."}
{"text":"We had two servers and they were wonderful! Very professional, attentive and respectful. Food came at a perfect time and I've never felt more welcomed. Definitely will come back. Btw, food was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my dad's wife's favorite restaurant. She thinks cilantro is exotic and Caesar salads are too spicy.  Applebee's isn't terrible. The food is.. edible? It is definitely over processed and bland, but there is at least a good variety of (tasteless) meals, and a few somewhat healthy choices. And they are open late. I wouldn't choose to go there, but if you gotta do a chain or entertain easily frightened Midwesterners it is OK.   This location tends to have horrendous service. One time we had to wait at least 30 minutes with empty dishes and cups and no check. We almost just left!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this new Applebee's restaurant.  First was disappointed that they do not use any apps for reservations.  However in hindsight I don't think that they'll need it... Based on my first visit I doubt that they will be very busy.  As always my first litmus test in my ordering a nice Guinness draft... Nope ... Not only no Guinness, but no dark beers on draft.  Strike 1  Found a nice looking shrimp Thai salad... And asked about soup... None that I cared for, so I asked for chilli... Nope ... No chilli... Strike 2  Wife ordered a meal and a side salad... A lengthily discussion ensued due to the fact that they do not have any common dressings ... Finally got the honey balsamic... Little did we know that it really didn't matter... We never got the salad! ... Strike 3  When our meals arrived I would have loved my wife to have taken a picture of my face... In the large shallow dish was the smallest $11 salad I've ever seen... It was about 5 inches in diameter... And an inch deep... With 6 shrimp.  About 8 forks and I was done. Wow... Strike 4  The waiter didn't ask if we would like dessert, and its just as well as we couldn't wait to get out of the place.  Have to add the fact that of the 4 flat screens that I could see... 2 displayed nothing... Broken? ... Don't know... The one that I had the best view of had kdka news on ... How entertaining...   Another funny thing that I'll remember... While waiting for our food... And that salad that never arrived... We had been sitting for 10 minutes with 2 glasses of water...  The waiter stopped by and asked \"how is everything?\" ... I replied that the ice water was great.  My wife said that my reply was mean... I told her that I disagreed... If I wanted to be mean I would have told the waiter that I ordered ice water with lemon and didn't get the lemon.  Another disappointing restaurant in Murrysville... Too bad."}

{"text":"I went there last night after 10 p.m. with my boyfriend. The reason why I gave such a poor rating was because 1) when we entered, there was no host at the front to greet us so we waited for a couple of minutes. Then shortly after, another couple came & we all waited until ANOTHER couple came, which by the time it would've been around a total of 10 minutes waiting. Still no one had talk to us yet, so the lady from the couple who arrived shortly after us, went to talk to one of the server and then someone FINALLY came to seat us. I mean it was a Friday night & they were busy, but it shouldn't have taken them that long to acknowledge that theres ppl waiting by the entrance, ESPECIALLY if theres 6 of us! The least they could do was acknowledge us & say that we'll have to wait for a couple of minutes but noooo, the workers were just walking pass us like we weren't even there. 2) our server did not even introduced herself to us like how any other sever would, which is a crucial part of their role correct? She just simply asked us what we wanted to drink. 3) she messed up our order. We ordered the deal 2 for $20 meal with a free appetizer, which consists of the whisky burger & the all American burger WITH lettuce and an appetizer of honey bbq boneless wings. We had also wanted a side of onion rings too. 4) So when our appetizers came out, the lady (not our server) just placed it & left. The appetizers she brought out were BOTH onion rings instead of onion rings & boneless wings. Clearly it looked like I was going to say something to her, like we had ordered boneless wings & not a second onion rings, but she already left, which in my opinion was so rude & adding that to the pile of rudeness that we've already experienced during our stay in that restaurant makes it even worse. So we told our server about it & she said she'll fix it & not charge us for the extra onion rings (the only positive part so far). 5) the lettuce was missing from one of the hamburger. 6) we paid & our server didn't even return my bf's card back along with the receipts inside the black booklet, so i told her about it. She tried looking for it & must've let her manager know about it. 7) the manager came to talk to us about the card & as i was still explaining to her how our server had handed our bill back to us inside that black booklet, she rudely interrupted me & said \"Okay but can you guys just double check for us again.\" I was thinking wtheck this bish thinks that we're lying about not getting our card back? Well if we did, we wouldn't have asked about our card in the first place! 8) turns out our server gave the card to another group of guys. 9) the manager nor the server did not even apologize about this situation. Once our server placed the card on the table, both her & the manager left without saying anything! 10) As we were walking out of the restaurant, we passed the group of guys who our server had given my bf's card to. One of them shouted \"see you later (my bf's name)! I don't know if we should take that as a joking way or what but, we hope that they didn't take any pictures of the card & is planning to do something evil with it, like go on a shopping spree because good luck we've already cancelled the card. Overall, I would say that this was the WORST customer service for a dining in restaurant experience I've ever had. The ONLY positive outcome from this experience was that we got our 2 for $20 meal w/ 3 appetizers all for just $8 & that is because our server had given us a $15 discount. But other than that, everything else was horrible. We were still generous enough to tip our server $5, considering all the bad customer services we've experienced & to think how most ppl would not even tip at all! We definitely won't be returning back there!"}
{"text":"Only gave one star because you can't give no stars.  Tried to order off their pick a pair lunch menu, the French onion soup and chicken wonton tacos, that is clearly on the menu pic I posted.  They said the chicken tacos wasn't an option.  Obviously they don't want my business.  I will go to Bonefish, it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Use to be a good restraunt, service has gone down hill steadily every time we go, quality of food has also declined. Save your money"}
{"text":"The food and our server Nay were great.  We sat at a table at the bar and 2 guys we thought were patrons who turned out to be employees of Applebee's were out of control loud and dropping curse words left and right.  No one, not even the manager, asked them to quiet down.  There were children in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the creamy chicken parmesan and the chicken and it's sauce was delicious. The rice was a bit too oniony by itself, but with the cooked spinach and chicken, it blended pretty well. Plus it's a healthy dish promoted by Weight Watchers and is really really yummy. I recommend it."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came here for dinner tonight. What a terrible experience! The food was OK, but nothing to brag about. Our waitress, was awful. She took at least ten minutes to greet us and take our drink orders, now mind you there were only two other tables in the restaurant at this time. We order our dinners, and the appetizer was out shortly. She finally brought out our meals almost 30 minutes later! And she left our empty appetizer platter along with out dirty dishes on our very small table. She never came over to check on us, we all needed a drink refill, which we never got. We were ready for our check and some boxes, another 30 minutes passed before we saw her to flag her down. We were paying with credit card and had the card out ready to go, she set the check down and walked away. I'm not exaggerating when I way 40 minutes passed by before she came to get our payment. When she returned she set the receipts down with a pen and walked away not saying thank you or even have a good night. It was very rude and unprofessional, and my sisters and I will not be returning ever again."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife on Friday 6pm 8/21/2016 the place was almost empty (1st red flag) there was only 2 people sitting at the bar on a Friday evening no less(2nd red flag) we got seated immediately and ordered drinks which arrived very fast. Looking over their menu was really an eyeopener you see they offer 2 meals for 20 dollar's but that only includes 1 meat or chicken dish with 2 sides of which consist of a  variation of what can be done with a potato such as garlic mash, wedges, baked, or loaded baked for an extra $2.29 and rice. There is no option for a salad unless you order it separate and it cost extra (3rd red flag) salad for me was the deal breaker this item has always been included with a meal. Oh and their hand carved sirloin must have been cut by a cook who forgot to wear his or her glasses because one end of the meat was 1 inch thick and the other end was 1/8th thick . The steak sucked the sucked and its my guess Applebee's will be a goner in 2017"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Service is always on point, the meals are always hot and out fast. Especially impressed with our server Jenna when we were here a few weeks ago, as a server I can be overly critical and she was fantastic! New favorite \"neighborhood\" spot!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and wanted to try something i know. Its ridiculous that a half sandwich and soup took over 30 minutes! Manager brings me my food sees that i am mad and doesn't try to do anything about it. As a manager of a restaurant myself i wouldn't let a guest leave unhappy without trying to fix the situation terrible place first and last time here! 2 stars is for the server who did a great job handled it better than the manager."}
{"text":"I give this place a one star simply because I can't give any negative stars. I went in on 6/13/17 @ 5:13 p.m. I was awaiting for my date in the bar area. I was approached by a male staff member who asked me to move from where I was sitting. When I asked him why I needed to move he replied \"we are holding this seat for 3 or more guest.\" However the restaurant was not, there were only 5 people including my self in the restaurant. So I asked the young man where he wanted me to sit and he directed me to the all black patron area which is in the back of the bar. I was offended and angry.  I asked him why? I told him I was waiting for my date and asked for the manager. He took forever and did not get the manager, so I asked another employee for the manager and the manager came out to me. I proceeded to tell the manage exactly what happened and the manager was very apologetic and offered free items. But I refused and advised him that I will take my money elsewhere and wait for my date in my car in the air conditioner."}
{"text":"first of all, sorry for my english...i'm italian... we were at AB this evening with my wife. tiffany was our server. while we were sitting, she passed 3 times saying that she needed \"only a minute\" to take our order, while she was talkjing with other customers. i ordered a 9oz sirloin with baked potatoes with NO BUTTER.  after 15 minutes i found on my dish a 4.5oz sirloin with a stone of butter with some potato on it.  i call tiffany explaining the problem. instaed to change my dish immediately, she discussed that i didn't want only sour sauce...wtf but i said NO BUTTER.... she said that she would have changed only the potato, leaving a gross quantity of melted butter on my dish. while i was waiting for my brand new potato, my 4.5oz sirloin was getting cold. not good appearance, my medium sirloin actually was a well done sirloin. the dessert time was approaching quickly, in my mind there was the idea that my triple chocolate cake would have been stunning.  i ordered that with a different pronounciation of the \"i\" letter of the word \"triple\". tiffany, very pleasantly, put her ear close to the table like \"i ain't get ya, bro\", for 3 times. while we were tasting our desserts, we heard her saying to another table that other customers didn't leave her the tip, saying that very loud. anyway we left a 15% tip, so she won't say the same about us to other future customers. thank you guys, we didn't appreciate your service tonight...aND we'll never come again!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and MIL -love- this place, me not as much. The food does little to please me, it tastes like microwaved frozen food most times. I have learned to be content eating the Asian grilled chicken salad, and it's not bad. The service is good, no problems there. The triple chocolate meltdown is the high point eating the entire meal here, IMHO!"}

When the guy took our order he seemed a lil to pushy to take our order and i was with a family of 8   2.by the time we got our food my sisters 4 cheese pasta was cold and had to ask to re-heat it , my mom ordered a steak (medium well) by the time she got it it was pretty much well done and it also looked like it was cooked well done   3.they`re really careless on how they serve/sanitize their cups , i ordered a drink and the cup had lipstick on it"}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Applebee's Strongsville  for her birthday lunch today and everyone was happy! We had a party of five and we were very happy with the service and the food. Our server, Beth, was the best and the door greeters were just as good. However, the food is just mediocre for the price. It just doesn't match the price. I think you could just get better food for the price somewhere else. Maybe it's the kitchen team- the Applebee's in Middleburg Hts  has much better food...just a thought."}
{"text":"The manager Brenda and our waitress Erika exceeded customer service going over and beyond! All made for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Other than a taco bell, this is the closest eatery near my house and truly is my neighborhood grill and bar.  We made a very last minute decision to eat here on Mother's Day night - arriving around 8pm to a very busy and bustling restaurant.  The business seemed a bit odd - I have never seen it this busy before and I think the staff hadn't either.  The service was a bit disorganized and slow.  The food was just A-OK.    Our food was simply okay - nothing spectacular here.  I tried a new chicken and shrimp dish served over spicy mexican rice.  It was good - but the shrimp are not the same shrimp seen on the menu cover!  Much smaller!  I had two very overpriced margaritas as well.    While we will visit this location in the future because it's near our house, we try to visit during happy hour times to save a few dollars on what can be very overpriced drinks.    We prefer to dine during their lunch times and take advantage of their lunch specials."}

{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday nite to burn up a gift card.  Seems most of the Applebee's in the Midwest are closed, so I panicked and brought it on a business trip. Ordered the baby back ribs and was absolutely amazed at how good they were.  However this is Applebee's YO (and not a good one).  The bartender seriously looked like a crossing guard at the local middle school.  The staff was definitely plucked from the 40-60 age group, which made we feel like a sad dude sitting at this Applebee's in Phoenix near the airport.  If I didn't have this Albatross gift card, i would have gone somewhere else.  Face it folks - Applebee's used to be cool.  But not as cool as Bennigans which has long been closed   Tick tock ....."}
{"text":"I used to avoid going to this location at all costs because of bad food and poor service, however I gave it one more try and was pleasantly surprised. I sat in the bar and had great service and delicious cheap margaritas. New late night spot!"}
{"text":"7:53 happy your cold food really why these restaurants suck so freaking much thank god for good company"}
{"text":"Not bad. About what you'd expect for an Applebee's. The burgers came out pretty good, I'd have to say. Service is average. I'd come back to an Applebee's in a pinch but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Best service ever, but worse food ever odered the pasta shrimp dish with a Caesar salad (build a combo lunch).  The salad part was great the shrimp dish sucked.  Menu made it sound like you were really get something special wrong move on my behalf for trusting the pictures.  What I got looked like a granny snack at a rest home.  Not that I'm a pig but the pasta was gone in 3 bites the little piece of bread and salad gone just as fast.  Then there's the iced Tea brown water with no taste, if it wasn't for the lemon I'd would of been hurting.   My wife's salad had avocado somewhere in it along with strwberries in it.  Absolutely did not even resemble the picture in the menu same goes for her sandwich.  Meal was very disappointing if minus stars were allotted, my vote is a negetive 3.  Sorry Applebees you shouldn't brag about about bad.  (Still hungry)."}

{"text":"This place is awful to order Togo from! My food was 15 minutes late, they forgot my fries, and the sauces.  The manager didn't even offer to discount the food and the poor Togo boy was running his butt off trying to make things right for two other Togo customers! Never again will I order Togo from this awful place! !! They need a manager who actually knows what she is doing!"}
{"text":"Anybody giving this place more than 2 stars just doesn't know food. I never bother with these types of places but my son's Dr. gave him a gift card. Of course we ordered the \"Double Glazed Baby Back Ribs\". They were neither double glazed nor were they baby backs. These were SPAREribs from a piggy that was fed a Slim-Fast diet. I asked the waitress if she has eaten these ribs and she replied she doesn't like ribs or any kind of BBQ sauce. So take that all you stereotypers not all blacks eat ribs. I told her my problem with the no meat ribs. She offered to tell her manager so I asked what will he do. She replied \"Nothing\"  I will be complaining to Corporate about the false advertising as the menu and advertisement descriptions are very misleading"}
{"text":"Ate here two days ago with a couple friends. Ordered the all you can eat soup and salad for lunch. French Onion soup and grilled shrimp and spinach salad. The food was very good. The two stars come from the service that we had. Our server was Kayla. She took forever to take our order. Never brought us a refill on drinks. We had to ask someone else because she didn't come by for so long. We all got the all you can eat lunch but trying to get a refill on the soup or salad was next to impossible. And when we did order it, it took 15 minutes to come out.  While the food was good, I definitely recommend going to a different Applebees where you can actually get waited on."}
{"text":"Service has always been excellent. usually i go there just by myself but sever always pays a lot of attention to me. I am not a big fan of their steaks - i think they are not tender enough and a bit chewy. but the rest of the menu is amazing! try parmesan shrimp or their pasta bowls. 2 for 20$ including an appetizer - who doesn't love that? thei garlic mashd potatoes loaded with sour cream are very good too."}
{"text":"We stopped in at 10:30pm after attending the Knights game for a late night snack.  Ordered a few appetizers, including the ribs.  Food arrived quickly and was quite good.  Portions contained enough food for the price.  Problem was the waitress, Krystal.    She delivered our food and since I ordered ribs, I asked for an extra napkin.  She said \"no problem\" and left, only to stop a short distance away to speak with two other employees for about two mins.  She then disappeared into the kitchen and after five minutes I decided to just get up and wash my hands in the bathroom.    As we were eating she walked past us two times, never once asking if we needed anything.  Once done we waited over 10 mins for her to come by, and when she did she passed us by for another table.  Had to flag her down to ask for the check.  She returned with the check, and again stopped to talk to employees.  Waited again to pay.  Very frustrating, left no tip."}

{"text":"Curbside service food NASTY!   We are sorry to write this review (3 May 2016) but our experience here at this restaurant really, literally left a bad taste in our mouth. This experience is not the 1st time we have received TAKEOUT   service and have called the Manager up to voice our concerns. The takeout food, in our experience, has been dry and left a nasty after taste lingering in our mouths. The  latest dish in question was the  NEW 4 Cheese macaroni  with honey tenders! Sounds delicious doesn't it?  Well if you like sweet  dry macaroni and a little sauce they say is 4 Cheeses U  can have it!  We ordered 2 of them and the NEW Stuffed Brisket Enchilada for my wife - Remember, this was for curbside service. 10 minutes later, when we got home, we dived into it. Wow, what a shock!     We all had FROWNS on our faces. It was horrible ...Sweet honey flavored  (Sugar) macaroni, and fried sweet tenders with a little of sweet sauce at the bottom of the takeout tray...Where's the 4 Cheeses? My wife's Enchilada stuffed was flat as a pancake and was soggy. All 3 of us threw it away quickly because we could not eat it and decided we would file a complaint with the Manager (Terry)  to please investigate his cooks food service skills, and check if the food was handled properly, and that they should not let food go out that is questionable. Manager indicated he would email us a complimentary gift certificate for which we thanked him. our experience on this restaurants TAKEOUT service SUCKS  something NASTY. Sorry.... but I won't order from their again! Remember... this is about the 3rd complaint we have had with this location on their curbside service takeout.  Hope u enjoy cause we didn't!  FM"}
{"text":"This Applebee's isn't bad. The servers are all pretty nice and friendly but the food has kind of gone downhill. The last three times, I've had garlic mashed potatoes; two times they were ice cold and the third time, they were so runny that I couldn't eat them. Whenever I order a salad, I order extra dressing and I never get it. The steaks and hamburgers are very good!! All in all, not bad for the money."}
{"text":"Expecting worse, I was surprised by the taste of the food. I've been to quite a few Applebee's restaurants. But, unlike most others this one's quality hasn't dropped over time. The salad tasted fresh, the meat was cooked to perfection and the seasoning was well balanced. Quite recommendable for a quick lunch or sports' night out."}

Plenty of drinks, some appetizers and although OUR service from the MANAGER LEON HALL was impeccable. .. our assigned server LEXI took it upon herself to make an inappropriate executive decision to charge someone at my table for an add on WITHOUT any type of consultation OR permission.

{"text":"We got to the restaurant and we were standing there for about 10minutes with no hostess greeting us or anything and apparently all the other parties waiting same thing we complained to one of the waiters and he said that she was suppose to be there at the front but he had no idea where she had gone and that he would look for her one lady told him that she had been told 30 minutes ago that it would be 10 minutes until they could sit them down and they were still waiting and there was no reason the restaurant was not busy there was people but there was plenty of staff and it seemed they were taking food out to the table quick but the wait time was still long. Finally we sat down after a 45 minute wait and the hostess ever showed up. So after the wait I expected good food and good service from my server and we did get great service from him the food was a disappointment I ordered a medium well steak and it was over cooked and dry I told the waiter he apologize and he said they got the order wrong he sent it back and this time the food took longer by the end I was just not hungry. I gave them 3 stars because the server was very attentive and super nice but other than that it was a disappointment."}

Also witnessed a dine and dash when we were here because service was so slow."}

{"text":"Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me \" it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants\". I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen.  I contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there, very friendly and easy to work with, called back was very impressed."}
{"text":"Saturday night, very busy. About 20 minute wait, not surprising. Bruschetta sirloin with potatoes was very nice. Staff was obviously stressed but food arrived timely and hot.

{"text":"Earlier today my friend & I ate here. She seemed to enjoy her meal. Mine tasted fine.   Unfortunately I got in my car leaving Applebee's parking lot feeling extremely ill. I had to restrain from vomiting the entire ride home (this was my first meal of the day). I have been sick ever since I ate there.  Do not order the bruschetta salad. In fact, just do not go there. Period. Your stomach may thank you.  I called Applebee's to let them know, and the manager was very stoic and said an insurance company would contact me shortly. That's it. No apology. Nothing other than, 'what's your name and when did you come here?\"  So in summary, I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. One of my favorite Waitresses who worked at a previous restaurant I loved now works at Applebee's. Me and my husband came in and were seated right away. Hostess was very friendly, but when I seen Zuri come over to greet us, she recognized me right away. Service was excellent as always. She is truly one of a Kind. Will be back again!"}

I've called 5 times and left my name and number requesting a manager to contact me back and I've received nothing so we have switched our family Applebees location from central and camelback to 44th street and oak and there is an awesome waitress we request her section and great manager! No Stars for food or location of central and camelback!"}

{"text":"I'm giving this experience a 2 star rating, as I can't do 1.5. I brought my son and his friend here for a bite to eat before the movies. We were seated rather quickly which was a plus. Our server seemed less than happy to have a job. We ordered two Bourbon Street Steaks and a Grilled Chicken Salad. Albeit this is a chain restaurant, one would think the orders could have been gotten correctly. I ordered my steak medium rare, it came out well done. My son ordered his rare, it came out medium well. As for saut√©ed onions and mushrooms, well let's just say if burnt is the new saut√©ed then I don't like it. Needless to say, I will not come back. For the price it could have been better."}
{"text":"Not great, even for Applebees. I recently moved to the area so I'll be checking out the local places. For this place, I went on a Friday afternoon for Happy Hour. Applebees is so generic it's hard to mess it up, right? That's what I was thinking, anyway.  I ordered margaritas and some appetizers. Although the staff was nice, nobody is doing their job well I'd say, mainly because everything I ordered was slightly off or slightly not cooked.   The margarita was strong I'll give you that- but there was way too much salt on the rim and the bartender didn't even give me the tiny straws or the lime with it so I had to ask. That's nothing to really complain about, but the shakers they give you are odd and clumsy too. I can see someone totally spilling their drink. They basically serve the drink in the shaker it's made in which is not aesthetically pleasing or functional. Anyway, the drink was good and strong and I had 2 more after that as I ate food to help stave off the buzz I had, but still prefer Chili's presidente margarita over applesbees.   The wings I ordered first LOOKED good, but did not taste great. It's \"double battered\" which means it's mostly breading, extremely fried, and not much meat, and the sauce they use gave me heartburn into the next day. NOT GOOD! A one star for the wings, will not come here for wings again.   I also tried some sort of pretzel appetizer which you can imagine to be like a baked pretzel, but these were... maybe fried? I'm not sure. They came out slick with oil and had sesame seeds on them, not salt, which was unappetizing. It was like a fried breadstick slicked with oil and no other seasoning at all. The cheese sauce with it was good, but I returned this appetizer as it was NOT GOOD even if it was only 3$.  I also ordered a bowl of french onion soup because I love that stuff. However, it came out luke-warm and the cheese wasn't even browned on top. I am usually not a fussy person so I ate it anyway but it tasted bland and cold and the cheese not being properly melted was disappointing. Whoever the guy working the fryer was, he apparently is great at his job, but the regular cooks and other guys needed to step it up, because my entree was cold in the middle as well- I ordered bourbon chicken and shrimp, which  is basically a pre-cooked freezer chicken breast, some crappy tiny popcorn shrimps and some potatoes that are supposed to be kinda crispy and cooked well but were raw in the middle (very unpleasant). It's to be served on one of the \"sizzling\" pans on a bed of sauteed onions and mushrooms. The entire bourbon chicken dish I ordered because it was low-cal, but to add flavoring they basically just throw some flavored margarine on top which does nothing to add to the dish positively and just makes it kinda oily. Also, the onions and mushrooms were NOT sauteed more like raw, and there was literally like ONE mushroom and a few slices of onion. The sizzling pan was not sizzling, either- another dish not properly heated.  Also, I must say there was a faint \"bathroom\" odor lingering in the restaurant at all times. The mark of a a plumbing issue for sure. I was seated on the right side of the bar, and the bathrooms are on that side of the restaurant so maybe it was less obvious in other areas, but it was quite unpleasant. Also, the next morning i had tummy troubles- from what I would guess was the improperly cooked food. Anyway, certainly not worth the expense and I will not be going here again and I would recommend people go to Chili's down the street instead."}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday and sat in the bar. It took 15 minutes before our waitress came to see us. We were getting ready to leave as soon as she came. We ordered nachos and beer. The beer came out warm and the nachos came out cold, it was gross. Definitely wasted money at this place and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Applebees is a decent place to get a hot meal. They've been remodeling a lot of their locations it seems, and this one has a nice feel to it. I think overall they have fair prices and a good selection. I wish they wouldn't have changed their menu so much. They took away my all time favorite dessert, the maple butter blondie. Sad day. But they've added some good stuff (shrimp and parmesan steak is not bad at all!) Applebees is a good deal, nice staff, okay design, nothing extraordinary, but does the job. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ate there yesterday.  Food was dry and burnt.  My husband was given mashed potatoes with sour cream over the top, he can't eat sour cream, so they charged us for a replacement.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Love my bartenders. No bars close enough to home, so I started stopping in here and I love it. Common courtesy will get you far here."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Went in during happy hour. 1/2 price appetizers. Ordered boneless and bone-in wings, mozzarella sticks and onion rings. $3 beers all day everyday. Can't complain.  Great service and delicious food. Recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar ten minutes, waiting for my Makers Old Fashion or to die of old age. Bar is dirty, glasses, napkins, plates all over. 3 bartenders, no organization. Only 8 people and myself at the bar. Old Fashion is surprisingly good. You would think she'd offer a menu. Or a glass of water. Waiting for second cocktail and my requested glass of water....second Old Fashion doesn't taste anything like the first. Too sweet."}
{"text":"I mean it's Applebee's, and you get what you expect. one thing bothered me a lot though: they call their Asian salad, an \"Oriental chopped salad\". like no. this is the 21st century"}
{"text":"It's Applebee's what can you expect. Sadly I think I have been spoiled by the one in Bismarck ND. Took my family to this one for there first visit to an Applebee's to see what I often talk about after my trips to ND. Sadly this one didn't cut it. Service was ok but not exceptional, booth was tidy but not clean. I could handle all that if food was up to standard but sadly tonight it missed the mark in a big way. If your going to cook frozen steak defrost it first, using the grill to finish the defrost process while cooking ruins steak! Two steak meals both ordered medium rare, 4 individual steaks and not one of them cooked medium rare when was well done the other jelly red in the centre and burnt on the outside.  Wish I had read the reviews first,"}
{"text":"We waited for over 15 minutes for drinks. My bf got his drink but I was finally told they couldn't make mine. If one of your signature drinks is a mudslide, how do you not have any kaluha? The waitress tried to fix the problem by offering to make it with Bailey's and I told her this would be fine. The bartender didn't even get around to making mine! The waitress ended up having to do it. The waitress was fine and nothing was her fault. But the food wasn't good. Small proportions. Just not a good night. Won't go back to the arrowhead location."}
{"text":"It's okay. Not bad, always busy so you never know what your food or service will be like."}
{"text":"I've visited this location many times in the past and the only thing that I have to say is \"This place has really fallen off.\"  One of the first things that you'll notice when you walk in on a weekend, is that the overall atmosphere of the place seems to be gloomy.  You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves.  The food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing.  The overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour.  If you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)"}
{"text":"Good service. Bad food. Very long wait. It was really busy . But our server Rachel was very nice and hospitable. I liked the location around a lot of shops. Maybe if it wasn't so busy it would have been a better experience. Might try it again"}
{"text":"The service is horrible . Don't waste your time or money. You'll get better service at Jack in the box ."}
{"text":"Came in for soup and a soft drink.  It took over 15 min for soup.  Had told waitress when i orderedI soup that I  wanted something else but she disappeared so I had to tell someone else.  They were not busy at all not even half the restaurant was full so I'm not sure why the service was so slow.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Applebees is Applebees. Consistantly good service and clean. I have never been served a bad meal. The people are warm and friendly. This particular Applebees is different from others I've been to, in that it is never crowded. The desert \"Shooters\" are just right.  Not too big and not too small. A winner."}
{"text":"Barmaid had an attitude from the jump. She had a sour puss with no customer greeting.  She looked to tall for the job. Furthermore, she kept calling people out of their name over and over again. Her service rating is a negative worst than having a bad day. Screaming for other employees across the Applebee's floor. While customers are trying to have a quite meal. She embrass herself and Applebee's."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Applebee's countless times and each time the food has been okay and the waiters have been mediocre. I liked the food that they have but for the past 3 times that I have gone. My food took ONE HOUR AND A HALF. That was unacceptable to me! They also didn't give a discount or even sorry for the inconvience. I remember seeing a commerical of how the food needs to be made in 30 minutes during happy hour or it all will be free. I guess that doesn't apply! Its probably another scam to bring customers in. I also didn't give the waitresses a tip each on of the times that the food was late. My friends and I were about to leave because the food took so long to come. I had ordered a simple spicy chicken salad and that took almost 2 hours to prepare. Other people's foods were being made before us when they had clearly come later then us. Probably not going to this place anymore more for late night food."}
{"text":"Have been to this location at least 6 times in the last 2 years. Each time I go with my family, it gets a little worse. This last time will be the last time, server was OK but never came back to ask about drink refills. Food took a long time, (20 minutes for just the appetizer), and the place was only about half-full. I feel sorry for the servers since they are the ones that loose-out when it comes time to pay!"}
{"text":"The general manager Neil has one of the nastiest mouths i heard in awhile. More curse words than a rap song. My kids heard him and said some guy was yelling like crazy in the back at the employees as they were going to the restroom. Poor employees. They be working like slaves, little petite ladies carrying a workload and getting it done and to hear them being treated like that wasn't very professional and is bothering. There's another guy Brian, totally slow. Doesn't seem very friendly. He flirts with the employees. He had done it while close to my table. The new lady Grace, she is ultimate. Very friendly, accommodating and the atmosphere is more friendly. Keep her. Billy is great. But the other two, very un pleasant like they don't like their job, shape up or ship out.  .   I am a frequent flyer so I get a bird's eye view of what's going on and this was a very unpleasant visit. Treat your workers better. Employ managers who don't curse in front of customers and make flirtatious innuendo towards their especially in front of customers. Get a better chicken source also by the way. The chicken dishes your serve are bland and are not digestive friendly.   Sincerely,  unsatisfied customer"}
{"text":"Terrible service! I had to ask the waitress for napkins three times, instead of bringing the napkins she went and sat at a booth with some customers. I had to get up and get my own napkins.   When I paid, she didn't bring me a receipt back and the change was incomplete. This place just keeps getting worse."}
{"text":"Whenever my friend from Flagstaff visits down here we always go to Applebee's.  Both of us love the boneless buffalo wings and the shot desserts.  The mixed drinks are awesom!  I've never had a terrible experience at any Applebee's I've gone to.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"To say the quality of this restaurant has gone down would be a serious understatement. We went for lunch. We ordered the unlimited soup, salad, and bread for $9.99. The salad was ok. I guess that is hard to mess up. The soup was not soup. It was the consistency of tomato paste. It glooped off of my spoon. When I asked for another, the waitress said \"well it's the same soup, so...\" And then just kinda shrugged like I was the problem. Then I asked for our bread which we didn't receive. She said \"we don't do that anymore. If you want bread it's a dollar extra.\" I explained that it was on the menu. She said \"well, it shouldn't be.\" Real nice. My advice, go to Chilis."}
{"text":"We did a car side thing. Which they told us would be ready in 15 minutes. So I drove 15 minutes there.  And not only did I wait another 20 minutes waiting in my car. But the food was burned, bland, and horribly cooked. 25 dollars wasted. Horrible food. I hope this place gets shut down."}
{"text":"I DO NOT recommend this place for internet orders or take out. I ordered a steak and asked for Medium Well and it was way over well done. The broccoli was under cooked and served with raw garlic. Also I had a half rack of ribs that was over cooked to burnt and again the broccoli was gross. Then I also ordered dessert from there, a strawberry cheese cake shooter, yeah well it looked curdled and not appetizing so I wasted my money. There seems to be a trend with hiring bad cooks at all applebees McDonalds would have been better than this place"}
{"text":"Insanely expensive for what it was: a microscopically tiny, overly spicy pulled beef sandwich accompanied by a tablespoon or so of cole slaw; a shrimp salad; 2 soups; and 2 iced teas. Came to $32+tip for lunch and I wish I had gone to Jack-In-The-Box."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would for this location.  I went to dinner there last night 12/26/15 at about 9:00pm.  The food was atrocious.  I ordered a sirloin steak that was almost white and very chewy. The vegetables were hard and under cooked. The waiter brought my salad out before the appetizer. So the appetizer came out cold.  When I voiced my concerns to the waiter he could care less about my dissatisfaction. He just said     \"well is there anything else I can get you?\" Like I would want to ingest anymore of this crap you call food. I was able to eat some of my dinner basically because I was starving, but I will never return. Bad service and bad food is all I need to wipe Applebee's off my list of preferred restaurants."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going to Happy Hour here a couple Friday's ago.  The entire time I was there I had to listen to a loud mouthed obnoxious drunk man at the bar.  He was so loud I couldn't concentrate on my conversation with my friend.  What was he bellowing about?  The drugs he was selling, the fight he almost had in the parking lot that brought the police to the restaurant, the gun he said he had strapped to him, the Latinos he used every racial slur to describe, how he'd sell his body if he was a woman....in addition to inserting himself in everyone else's conversation.  And no less than 5 Applebee's employees were in his presence OFTEN during all this and no one thought maybe they should ask him to leave.  They just kept serving him more alcohol.  He had a beer, a mixed drink and a shot sitting in front of him at all times.  What a disgusting experience.  I gave the manager an earful before I left, and I'll NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"In from Chicago.  It was not my idea to come to this place but went with the program.  Never a fan of this place.   Food bad but service was great.  No wonder why Applebee's closed locations in Chicago.  Wasted our money. I hate that. If yelp let me give this place less than one star I would. But one star is deserved for service."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great and very slow.  I ordered a simple plate of steak and potatoes. The steak was over cooked and dry. The potatoes were under cooked and bland. Only good thing on my plate was the vegetable sides."}
{"text":"There are literally no more than 40 patrons in the restaurant and I'm here with family and we have been sitting here for about 30 minutes and our food has not been served yet. Never had service this bad before."}
{"text":"Honestly if you ignore the aroused minotaurs and random holes it's honestly pretty great for an Applebee's. If you like eye candy there's this gorgeous blonde hair blue eyed hunky waiter... Christ he's such a hunk... I'd fluff his pillows if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"always go here! every now and then we sit at the bar and the bartender gives great fast service! there was a bartender in training the last time we went \"Briana\" I believe was her name and SHE WAS AWESOME!!!! so much fun to talk to, great customer service!"}
{"text":"I must have gotten pranked because no service could have been this bad. Favorite part was when the server tracked us down in the parking lot to scold us for not having tipped him more."}
{"text":"Went in for 6 oz sirloin with salad and fries. Received salad. 10 minutes after ordering. New I would get dinner just after. I took 2 bites. Steak was poor quality with strange taste and fries cold. Server was slow to get any thing I would ask for. Lost my business. I would stay going to Outback. Better quality and price."}
{"text":"Blah expensive food. I ordered the nachos, worst I've ever had. Something outside is draining into parking from restaurant,ew."}
{"text":"Concord-  Went to this location of Applebee's for lunch yesterday.  As other reviewers have noted, once you've been the one Applebee's, you pretty much been to all of them. This franchise's consistency is to be recognized.   We decided to take advantage of the 2 for $20 entree special with a appetizer included. The mozzarella sticks were among the best I believe I've ever enjoyed. Great job on those. The All American Burger I had also was fine, however not as outstanding as the appetizer was.   The only critique I can offer on this visit is in regards to our server. Her performance was adequate, however one thing was a distraction from the meal. Perhaps it is a prejudice of my being older than the Millenial generation, but a heavily tattooed woman does not project an image of which I would want as a server in my restaurant. Just a personal observation, may be totally ignored by many these days.  To summarize, it's an Applebees meal which met the expectation."}
{"text":"I came in tonight and was sat down at 11:15PM it was 11:30 and the waiter never came to my table he came by the 4 tables around me but did not come to me. I was not happy so I left. The guy who sat me down instead of saying \"have you been helped\" said have a goodnight.  This Applebee's sucks."}
{"text":"I like applebees. But This location used to have great staff.  Applebees is now like an overpriced McDonald's. I do not recommend. There are so many other options in Tempe."}
{"text":"Bland American traditional with a healthy side of apathy!  Went in at 11PM on a Wednesday to kill some time, and killed it was. Less than 10 tables with guests, and a few at the bar, but we waited almost 10 minutes for a server to notice and find us a table.   But it got better. Appetizer arrived with no plates or silverware. We asked for some. Then entres arrived, still no silverware. We asked about silverware again. The server rolled her eyes, then stopped at 2 tables to take orders before finally dumping 2 forks for 3 people on the table. We asked for an ETA on our drinks and maybe a third fork; we were told that the bartender was swamped (3 people sitting at the bar). So our server meandered to the back and maybe had a nap.  We never got the third fork, but luckily the appetizer came with a spoon. Our 2 mixed drinks arrived after our entres were nearly finished. And it was all ice..."}
{"text":"I have never been to an Applebee's before. I try to avoid chain restaurants as a whole, but I had to meet a group there. Surprisingly, the food was good. I had the quesadilla burger, and although it was different, it was good. I also tried the artichoke dip and deep fried green bans, which I loved! The others with me also enjoyed their food. The waitress was very friendly and provided great service. This is one chain that I will return to, especially for the deep fried green beans!"}
{"text":"Ok so it's a chain and that generally means more concerned with money than good food and great service. This Applebee's is not much different than most. My daughter and I went there for a quick mea, she had the Turkey Sandwich with Avocado and I had the Vidalia Onion Sirloin. The sandwich was average and the fries were a bit cold. The sirloin, despite being ordered medium rare was medium well and the \"smashed potato\" is actually a boiled potato that is \"smashed\" after boiling. While this has potential, sadly mine was undercooked and not crispy on the outside at all. I doubt it was pan seared after boiling, and it wasn't really boiled long. The creamy garlic spinach was saut√©ed and had a small piece of garlic, but I don't fell it qualifies as \"garlicky.\" We elected to try the electronic ordering unit on the table for an additional beer and desert. While it was convenient to use and the bartender brought my beer almost immediately it was not the brand I ordered. The dessert was also delivered quickly by a gentleman but only part of the dessert was actually delivered.  This is a major fail if staff is unable to read what is ordered and certainly bodes poorly for the restaurant.   Based on the food quality alone I would give this Applebee's two stars, add in the issues with the electronic ordering unit and a two star rating nearly was cemented. Our waitress, Shauna W made the dining experience much more enjoyable and easily brought our dining experience up a level. Not only was she engaging and knowledgeable about the food items, but she saw the wrong beverage bring delivered and immediately corrected the bartender and made sure I got the proper one. She also walked over when dessert was delivered and when I mentioned it was on,y part of the order she immediately made sure I got the rest of the order. Shauna is the type of employee that any business should be overjoyed to have and she alone is the reason I would return again."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday bout 8pm. Bartenders were great food was amazing as always. One star lost because of David the manager. We were enjoying the games on TV and our food had just came when David turned up the lights full blast like it was last call. We were planning on a couple drinks afterwards so I asked David to turn them down. He turned them down slightly. Not enough though. It was terrible really seemed uncaring of the few people who were at the bar. By the time we finished our meal everyone had cleared the bar. I plan on coming back because you can't beat the club sandwich but won't be sitting at the bar again. DJ and Christian were fun 5 stars for them. I liked them a lot. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's in general- it's so... vanilla.  But once in awhile I meet my brother for a quick mid-week lunch.  The location is convenient, they have a great lunch menu, and it's fast.  The oriental chicken salad keeps me coming back, it's always fresh and crisp, and they have a half size in addition to their full size salad."}
{"text":"it's a chain restaurant, so it is not going to win any awards for \"best chef\" or anything like that.  When you go to a chain you expect consistency in service and food, and that is what you get here. The menu is predictable and uninspired, but then again, you don't go to a place like this to be inspired, do you?  The service is decent and the servers are friendly.  It is a place you can take the kids, grandma and pretty much anyone in the family.  For a family-style chain restaurant, you get what you expect here: decent food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with my coworkers and had the best experience from our server, Wendy. It's hard to find people who exemplify outstanding qualities regarding customer service but she is definitely a diamond in the rough. Thank you for making my very first experience at Applebee's the very best."}
{"text":"Fish and chips are good but the ribs were a bit poor. Everything is a tad too expensive for a chain restaurant. Staff are decent though."}
{"text":"Sorry. But we will not be coming here anymore.  And this is why.....  1) There was a party of loud drunk older women screaming every 2 seconds!!!  Please it is only Applebee's. Not a club.   2) Happy hour has different drink specials.  Not impressed. We would have drank more  but drinks tasted weak and watered down    Changed cup size on hubby's beer and is even more expensive.   3)  They must have a new cook. Food is not like it used to be.  We all ordered stuff with fries and there were like 5 pieces of fries on each plate. Really!  Fries are cheap!!!  Salad was over dressed and too much croutons.  My son had a piece of lettuce core in his salad. Come on. Quality control!!!  Why would you serve me trash?  We do really appreciate the girls who served us were really nice especially since we had to deal with the drunks interrupting our meal. Jason was awesome and gave us a discount for having to deal with that crap the whole meal. Good looking out for your other paying customers!!!  That's the only reason they got the 2 stars.   Some advice?  Fix your food ASAP!  We used to come on a weekly basis but this may have been the last time. :-("}
{"text":"I order Applebee's almost every week or every other week due to its convenience and just the food itself.  I live literally walking distance away from this location and let's just say that's the only reason it is getting 2 stars.   They constantly mess up my pick up order. Whether it be forgetting sides, making my food incorrectly, giving me the ingredients for my French onion soup I ordered in separate containers (so I can make it myself ?) there is always something.   I literally drive to the location on fort Apache and 215 ( a good 15-20 min drive) just to avoid dealing with this location.  Not good for being so close to the airport, you think they would be on their game for tourists."}
{"text":"You should sit at the Bar. Norma, Katrina, Alicia, Chloe and all will treat you right."}
{"text":"Okay ,  I LOVE APPLEBEE'S !!!   The portion size is great , the food is okay but I honestly come here because the SERVICE IS AMAZING . Something I'm always joking about is everytime I go there the menu changes but whatever.  Go here if you want something casual , fun. Don't go here if you're looking for amazing food because it's just okay."}
{"text":"I am giving it 2 stars ONLY because the manager was nice. Our waitress was awful..the food was inedible...how do you screw up mashed...instant mashed by the managers admission...potatoes? Consistently of cement and zero taste. How does a cook forget butter and salt? How do you cook and send out a medium steak that is so well done that it can't be cut? Save the money and the frustration and go somewhere else.  I came home and made a delicious grilled cheese."}
{"text":"So I tried to do a call in order here took them almost 10 min to even answer the phone. Once I told the girl what my order was she didn't even ask me what sides I wanted just \"is that all\". Not the way a business should be ran if you ask me. Wont be calling or coming here again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, Horrible car side to go!! This is the second time we have called to place an order over the phone and when we get there EVERY EMPLOYEE IS CLUELESS!! NOBODY PUT THE ORDER IN!! AND the Waiter lied to us saying that the kitchen is busy, implying our order is taking an HOUR instead of telling us the truth in the beginning. I spoke with a manager and all they said was \"sorry we will coach him on it\" NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!! Even when you dine inside, they are slow and get their orders wrong. I would give them zero stars but i don't have that option on Yelp  Update: After waiting 45 minutes for our food to be ready to-go, My friend had to talk to the manager too and finally the employee that messed up admitted to the master she didn't do the right thing"}
{"text":"Burgers are great! Classic turkey sandwich is amazing - real turkey, not lunch meat. We go here all the time! However, went to restaurant this past Saturday, at 4:30pm with my husband, son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters. It was empty!!! Yet it took over 25 minutes to get our meals. Mine - salmon - was overdone, vegetables were awful and potatoes were lacking. Pushed my plate away after tasting the salmon. Shared ribs with my husband - they were \"okay'  - not great ...BUT the chicken wanton tacos were AWESOME!! (my daughter-in-law shared!). These were piping hot so apparently all of our dinners were cooked first and waited on the wanton tacos. After voicing my dislike for the salmon, manager came to our table, apologized and moved on. He did take it off the check. . Dessert then came late...they brought out cake/ice cream out WAY before they brought the sundae for my grand daughter's birthday. WHAT? Then it took over 15 minutes for us to get the check.  It was awful and we won't go here again. So  sad, cause it's right around the corner and convenient. But.....bad food, bad service? No thanks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here all the time. The food is pretty good, service is typically great, prices are reasonable!  We like it well enough because it is right around the corner from us.  We brought our son, daughter-in-law and 2 grand daughters for dinner on a Saturday night. It was my grand daughter's 3rd birthday. Sadly, we were quite disappointed. When we arrived, it was early -  4:30pm - and there were only 2 other tables with customers. Quite empty, which we thought was good as we figured service would rock! Not so. While the server brought the mac 'n cheese out for the girls immediately, the rest of our meals took over 25 minutes to arrive. I had the salmon - it was overcooked and the vegetables were, well, awful. My daughter-in-law's combo appetizer plate was amazing - (grilled chicken wanton tacos-to DIE for!) but clearly her plate held up the rest of our meals. It was fresh and piping hot! All of ours were cold.  We mentioned it to our server, the manger came to our table and apologized, took the salmon off our bill. Nice gesture but then the birthday sundae came to our table about 10 minutes AFTER my husband got his triple chocolate meltdown. Try explaining to a 3 year old why she had to wait for her \"birthday\" sundae! The servers sang the happy birthday thing and it was nice.  THEN.......we waited over 15 minutes to get the bill. Finally, all of us except my husband left. He had \"words\" with the manager about the bill coming so late. Again, we were quite disappointed and will probably not go back again."}
{"text":"This is the worst Applebee's! This was the second time me being here and their customer service is the worst.  My family and I waited ten minutes expecting to be seated, waitress makes eye contact but completely ignores the fact that we are there. I walked up to the manager told her we had been waiting, instead of apologizing for the wait and walking us to a table she goes out of her way to have a talk with a waitress. I was agitated and never will I come here!"}
{"text":"Sat for 10 mins before anyone came to ask for drinks. Hostess didn't even ask if we wanted a booth and manager walked by 2 times without even trying to offer to take our drinks order or acknowledge we haven't been served. No wonder no one is ever here. My server girl was attentive however. Hostess and manager was not welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Much, much better than the one on Desert Inn & Maryland. The workers greet you when you come in and when you sit at the bar.  And the bartenders are the best. What can I say?... This is my new Applebee's spot. I truly don't mind driving the extra miles for quality service."}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch and I was with two other people when they brought our food my food was fine but the other lady with me ordered a strawberry and avocado chicken salad. The arugula was soggy on the whole salad. She said she did not want the salad and asked the server to take it back and get something else instead(NOT salad). So all the while we were eating our food she sat there waiting for the waiter to return to order something else. By the time she finally returned to take her order we were bites away from being done. Disappointed because the time it took to get back to her she told the server never mind they are all ready finished with their lunches. The server said okay. When the manager came around he offered to order another salad which she did not want because of the first one. The manager in a joking manner said well I have been so busy sorry I was not there to watch all the food coming out and said the salad had been taken off our bill. I was very disappointed that he approached it that way. Of coarse the salad should not be on our bill she had to send it back because the arugula was no good. He was not doing us a favor be taking it off the bill. Going out to lunch is a treat and not something we get to do all the time. This was a horribly customer service experience and resulted in her not even getting to eat lunch with us. I will not return to this location again."}
{"text":"The service is lousy. One waitress. Table was dirty. The blinds on the windows are nasty. The food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Service is horrible!!  We were seated immediately and then waited 15 minutes for our server to take drink order.  I was just getting up to leave when she came over.  2 of our 3 orders were brought out by the manager who was carrying them like a football, it was weird that he couldn't carry 3 plates and the idea of my food being close to his armpits kind of grossed me out.  My sons drink was empty and the waitress stopped by the table as soon as food was out and said she would bring him a refill.  We had finished eating and I love the pay at the table kiosk so we could get out quick rather than having to wait for our waitress who we never saw again after our food first came out, he never got his refill.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Awful experience. My girlfriend and I just wanted a quick bite that wouldn't make us feel like crap, so we fell for the Applebee's ad for low calorie options. We got there and we're seated near the door despite there being plenty of room in the restaurant. They seated a man who appeared to be homeless and providing his own beverage choices (he poured a clear liquid into his water glass).  We didn't get to order for about 15 minutes. We both ordered an under 500 calorie meal and neither of us finished it. It looked like a diet microwave meal dumped on the plate. Some of the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery while others were undercooked and translucent.   Not going back, even though it is just down the street."}
{"text":"We went to Applebee's, hoping for a relaxing evening. The food was good, but the service was not. Hoping to get water, or even order an appetizer, we saw our server when she took our order, after we had waited sometime and finally realized we could order our appetizer on the little kiosk. The next time we saw her, she was apologizing for not getting all our food out. If you don't mind waiting, or needing to remind your server about your order, this is the place to be. If you want actual service, maybe look somewhere else."}
{"text":"We will never go back.. we have tried twice on our lunch break and our orders were wrong so they had to be remade which left us no time to eat. servers were rude .. we were late both times back to work."}
{"text":"Horrible service time and time again. Just sat in a booth for 15 minutes w no waitress or order. 10 minutes later a waitress tells us she will be with us...never saw her again. Complained to hostess which went upon deaf ears   Dont know why I would ever try been like this since they opened"}
{"text":"I quit going to Applebee's years ago.  But my niece graduated and my brother and his family chose here for us to meet up after the ceremony.  We were a group of 14 so I already figured if they couldn't get me and my wife's stuff right that this had the potential to be a disaster.     It was.  First it took forever for the food to come out.  But like I said it was 14 people so whatever.  I ordered the Triple Dog Dare Ya which was supposed to consist of a sandwich with onion straws, pulled pork, bacon and ham.  When they brought out the food I noticed that the onion straws looked burnt.  I tasted them and of course they were.  Visibly burned and there was no bacon.  Like why would you send that out?  Told the waitress and she took it back.  It came back very quick with a heaping of onion straws, like a comical amount like they were upset I sent the sandwich back.  I then noticed that there was no pulled pork on the sandwich.    How does one make a sandwich minus TWO major ingredients AND burned onion straws.  I talked to the manager this time.  I told her I don't even want the sandwich because clearly they don't know how to make it.  I chose just a regular bacon cheese burger.  Like they can't possible F this up.  Well that took forever to come out.  I had to go looking for the waitress to tell her never mind because everyone was finished eating and I asked her if she was planning on charging me for it and she said she thought the manager was going to.    The manager had brought the plate to the table while I had got up to find the waitress and told my wife in this BS tone not to worry about paying for it.  Applebee\"s is a joke of a restaurant.  And the management had no professionalism."}
{"text":"Where do I start.? The food is so generic here I had the steak and vegetables which was okay my vegetables were cold. My friend who I met up for lunch had a burger that wasn't cooked was overcooked. His vegetables were all so cold. And one of my other friends had the shrimp  they were not good at all. They lack seasoning. I gave it three stars because the service was good and the way it was really really nice."}
{"text":"Good food , excellence service Those ribs are awesome . We will be back .the hostel was so nice . Desert really good."}
{"text":"Only came here to use a gift card. Worst service ever from the manager on down. Nothing more I can say."}
{"text":"BADDDDD SERVICE!!!! Didn't serve drinks in time coffee was cold asked for napkins and never got them I do not recommend eating there at all?!?!"}
{"text":"This was an awful experience. The hostess was the only one who looked as if she had even showered, but she was pissed to be working. Our waitress had on leggings and slip on crocs. She had no clue as to what was on the menu. The waitress serving the table behind us was just as clueless with her table. There was a table with an unruly child, and the first couple got up and left because of it, within minutes they sat ANOTHER poor couple there. They moved. The restaurant was no where near full so there were several empty tables to seat people, but AGAIN they say more people at the adjoining table. We were so desperate to get out that we left a huge tip just so we wouldn't have to wait for change.   The food was wrong, and the shrimp had been nuked.... Definitely a letdown.   It would be amazing what a good manager could do for this place. A hygiene lesson to the waitresses and a quick lesson in professionalism. When you can sit and observe the majority of a restaurant suffering from bad food and bad service, it's the managements fault."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is awfull. Seems like they're always shortstaff. I've been there 3 times and everytime we have an issue with the service. You place your order with the waiter/waitress and just takes to getyour food. Last time i waited 45 minutes and we decided to leave because the waitress came back and told us that for some reason the order was not put in the system.  Not coming back to this particular Applebees."}
{"text":"Applebee's reminds me of childhood. It's the first casual chain type place I remember going to as a kid, but it'd been years and years before tonight.  It's a solid meal, flavorful, good portion, decently priced. Lighter options that don't taste like crap.  Efficient servers, always moving, always busy. Extra star just for them.  My plate was composed far better than you can tell from my photo. The server just asked me (politely) to cut into my steak to make sure it was cooked to my liking before I could get a picture."}
{"text":"The food was awful, the service was worse and I was sorry that out of all the places to go in that area we chose this one.  It was not my choice and will never be the choice of anyone in our family again.  The food was overcooked, not what was ordered or cold..take your pick!  The waitress that did finally show up to take our order never showed up again but we got two other waitresses that refilled our drinks all wrong and one looked at me crazy when I told her we ordred fries instead of this big mushroom cap with spinach on top!  So the plate comes back with cold fries AND the mushroom!  Yuck.  The steaks were over cooked and oh so small.  The portions have shrunk but the prices have gone up."}
{"text":"We have been customers at this location twice. The first time wasn't that bad. The server was cool and friendly. They still try to upsell you, but I understand; the bigger the check, the bigger the tip. The food is terrible! Sorry, It just is. Our second time, the server was also nice and friendly, but this time, the food was atrocious! We won't eat here ever again. Not because of the staff, it is because of the food. It is inedible and over priced. 5 stars for the staff, plus -3 for the food."}
{"text":"Take out food was fine. Hot when it came out. I was there right on time but I sat in my car for 9 minutes past the time ready. No apology, thank you or recognition that it was not ready on time by worker given."}
{"text":"My last visit to Applebees was very dissapointing. Upon entering the restaurant smelled like someone farted. I order the Green Goddess wedge salad and when i got it the lettuce was room temperature, now i know im no expert but i know perishables need to be refrigerated and the dressing was supposed to be green goddess, It was blue cheese with blue chees crumbles. When we got our food which always takes a long time, my husband's order was wrong..he ordered a reg. hamburger and it came to him with cheese on it, if he wanted a cheeseburger he would have ordered a cheeseburger. That order had to go back and we had to wait another 10 minutes. My order came..but the food tasted like its been sitting on the counter for a long time. Nothing was hot,tasty or delicious like it used to be.We ended up leaving the food,paid our bill and vowed never to go back."}
{"text":"Another chain sit down by the mall,  but not at the top of my list. The food hasn't seemed to change since I've gone here except for less options.  Waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times. Recently got a burger there. Asked for well done,  and burger arrived bloody and red.  Waiter took it back and about 5 minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside.  Was offered something else,  but the others I was with were already done.  Did get a coupon for a return visit. Good deal with the 2 for $20 and an app if your food is cooked right."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was delicious! Had a great time with my girlfriend! Will ba coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Seated quickly wait staff, not sure which was our server, walked by multiple times without even looking our way. Place wasn't busy at all. Left and went across the street to another restaurant which was very busy but seated us a took our order within a couple of minutes.  If you are looking for a quick lunch don't go here."}
{"text":"Great food, sub-par service, and little attention to detail.   We recieved the wrong order due to the server's error.   No compensatory effort was made.   not even a free dessert after waiting an \"EXTRA\" 2 hours.   Bottomline, dont eat here unless u got some spare time to blow."}
{"text":"I liked this Applebee's alot. The service was great. Really attentive and nice waitress. I also feel like Applebee's is one if those places where you can count on what you r ordering. It was clean and nice atmosphere wise. I also take advantage of the 2 for 20 pick up option sometimes. My only complaint is that I ordered a steak well done and it was fully red inside but I was already home and we had company so I couldn't even return it. And I couldn't eat it because I don't like it that way so I was still hungry that night. Next time I will specify \"no red meat inside\"   But yah it's a cool place and I went with my In laws and love them so I think that makes the memory even better"}
{"text":"I have to say I have been going to Applebee's restaurants for over 16 years and this last experience was not so pleasant.   Food- It was great, the veggies were a bit on the over cooked side because it was supper soggy.  Martini- I was in the service business for some time, but the use of a jigger is pretty routine for a commercialized business. My martini was just fruit juice in a fancy cup, come on people use the tools of the trade or at least the flash cards to build a drink.   Service- Ooooh my! When ever you have a hostess seating and taking orders and waiting tables and might I add covering other tables \"it's a no win situation\" for the guest. The service in short, sucked! Two people covering the floor and no manager to be found in eye sight!  Get your stuff together people, or shut it down!"}
{"text":"The vanilla blondie is absolutely ridiculous! This dessert will make you dream about Applebee's throughout the entire day!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great service. Will definitely come back. If I'll visit Calgary, this is one place I'll take my family. Great for kids. Try the calamari. Really good."}
{"text":"The customer service was terrible..came in and the host said the wait was 25 minutes because we had a big party. The manager came and said  it would be 10 minutes bcuz they had to put tables together. No one came back  2 check on us at the door for 30 minutes.I asked plenty of times to why we haven't been seated.One guy said bcuz they were trying to figure out our waiters.It seems as though no one wanted to work, the restaurant  wasn't even crowded. The waiters were talking in groups for 20 minutes and we were still not seated.I asked 2 speak to the manager again bcuz he never came back, he was looking as if I'm  getting on his nerves.I ask him why are we not seated and his waitress came and interrupted our conversation  really rude and blew her breathe at me..I asked her if she had a problem..she was so rude. Another manager came to seat us bcuz the one manager wasn't  doing his job. When we got to the table we had no waiters and waited another 20 minutes for water and menus. We left bcuz the service was terrible and the waiters were rude/ghetto and  the one manager did not care to take care of us.I would never go back especially  when I'm spending my money..Please do not go to this Applebee's. Go to the one on Mayfield Road."}
{"text":"I am done with Applebees. A friend and myself stopped their today to have a drink and dinner, we sat at the bar, the bar tender came over offered us menus and walked away. We were the only people at the bar and he did not ask us if we wanted a drink, he walked to the entrance and just stood there, we watched him for ten minutes and got up and left. There are plenty other places I can give my money to."}
{"text":"This place really sucked super slow service took 20 minutes for them to even come ask what drinks we would like then literally waited 30 minutes for our food. Never coming here again !"}
{"text":"Place is disgusting.  Staff at bar falling over and being obnoxious while in uniform.  Found hair in my food on several occasions.  Drinks were terrible. My advice. ...go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review because my family and I have come to this location for years and it's always great everything, expect the past few times we went. Tonight we went and it was the final straw. They changed their menus once again. Didn't have the 2 things we really came for. They messed up my wings so they had to cook them again. My families food you could tell was under the heating lamp while mine was being cooked again. My sons Mac and cheese was disgusting. Steamed broccoli was cold. Server forgot our fries. The soda was watered down. It was just horrible. The server was somewhat alright. Not the best but not the worst. We did get a discount on our meal which was nice but still not coming back with all the new restaurants that are opening up around it."}
{"text":"Used to be a great location, but we had a very poor experience recently. Extremely long waiting, poor service and grumpy waitress."}
{"text":"Never ever for lunch in the bar area Mondays are the worst I been comin here for years. They still have my dinner/happy hour but they lose me at lunch. To be blunt food is ok service is hit or miss. More miss. But I only eat in the bar to be fair. The last time after watching the manager and the help all sitting at a table eating icream. At lunch hour I walked out after five min no help. I don't think the noticed and I was the only one in the bar I can see why. I drove to he store at bell and 101 it was packed service was great."}
{"text":"A collection of quotes from our table  -overbaked -\"this isn't medium rare\" -\"my stomach hurt before I came in here but now it hurts more\" -\"Needs more clocks\" -\"no comment\" -\"the waiter gave me... a look\" -asked several times for order, didn't come at the same time, not enough chips for dip -*shrugs* -sad!!!! -not lemony enough"}
{"text":"We have had customer service problems with this place in the past, but this time I can say that I will never go back. We ordered two pasta dishes and a few hours after eating it my family got severe food poisoning. It was a horrible experience. Don't go here. You will get sick."}
{"text":"Brunch burger was great service took long seems to have not enough waitress's, but food was good"}
{"text":"Worst service, waiter didn't smile or care of his service. Even the manager on duty didn't observe of what some of his employees were acting, there we're some that we're trying nevertheless but I would of thought that all Applebee's were had the same standards. Sorry to say that this one location I will never go to again and will let people know."}
{"text":"It was nice here.  Love it hanging out with family. the servers were awesome and the food was excellent. not to mention the 3 dollars beers all day everyday. would definitely recommend this place to everyone and will come again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend  and I decided  to go out for the evening for a bit to eat. I said Apple bees it's my favorite place...untill we got there got seated and was ignored  for almost  20 mins..when finally  we just got up to leave and was approached by the manager of Applebee's who was wondering what was going on we told him that we had been sitting there for over 15 minutes no one came to bring us anything no water no napkins know anything but then two white ladies came in elderly ladies they where sat down right beside us. immediately there were three servers there to help them and give them water and taking their order, the manager was very very nice he gave us free drinks an offer to be very good to us if we decided to stay but we decided to leave and I think that will be my last visit to that Applebee's not saying don't go there to eat the food is great the manager is a very nice man just know who your waiters are..... jadeblk1"}
{"text":"We ate carryout 3/12/15. The phone order was pleasant had parking area just for pickup they asked what kind of car they came out to the car I paid the food was hot and was as good as the pictures  Dave"}
{"text":"Very mediocre lunch at Applebee's today. I've been there twice before today and so had low expectations, and they did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and service good, but the food was just corporate-restaurant slop. I ordered the pasta and it arrived lukewarm. The salad was just ok-the plate was so small that it was hard to eat without it going all over the table. Very small portion of dressing served on the side. I only went there because my friend wanted to go, but next time-well, there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Dined at this place on 12/12/2014 evening time, on our way to Vegas. Stopped off to get some dinner. I must say our waitress was one of the most unprofessional, rudest waitress I have ever encountered. I ordered one of their new hamburgers + fries ($9.99), and my date ordered a chicken Caesar salad ($11.99).   Initially I asked about substituting the french fries for a small side salad, and I was told that I would be charged $3.29 extra, I understood, and politely declined the french fry/side salad swap.   When my hamburger arrived I politely asked for some tomato, lettuce, and pickles because for $10 I'd like my hamburger to have some fixin'...ya know. That's how I like my hamburger. When I made the request I was rudely told that the hamburger didn't come with lettuce, tomato, and pickles. Really??? a $10 hamburger with no fixings? Really? Anyway, while my date was enjoying her $12 Caesar Salad, she proceeded to pluck out one of the biggest pieces of salad (butt) aka Cobb hidden in the bottom of here salad. Talk about whack! All filler no killer here.  I believe the waitress name was Courtney or something like that. She looked slightly preggers. I honestly did not want to leave a tip as she had this awful attitude toward us the whole time, but unfortunately she never returned with my change on a $23 tab.   This place is GOD AWFUL!!!!!! And I would recommend passing by on your way to Vegas, and find a different place to eat where they treat their customer well.  P.S. I did not once see a manager on duty. Friday night 7PM is, and the place was fairly busy.  DO NOT EAT HERE if you enjoy decent service."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it is always horrible service. I'm a waitress as well so I try to be very easy going with servers because I know how hard of a job it is. Tonight it took almost 30 min just to be greeted and an additional 10 min just to get our drinks. The server never came back to refill our drinks and the manager was soooooo rude. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Just had a terrible time. Will be calling tomorrow to speak with a manager. Will update how manager responds to guest issues"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  My 2nd time at this location.   This time for a working lunch.  Amy was Great! Super warm and friendly.  So was the Manager who let me sit where every I wanted.    The staff here is super accommodating.     I had a grilled chicken bbq sandwich with Swiss cheese and bacon.   Great tangy BBQ sauce.   I also had the French Onion Soup.  I'll definitely have that again.   Internet was easy to connect to.    I was here a month ago after a concert late night with a friend.   Same friendly experience then too!.    Applebees did a great job with the hip new modern style interiors - one of the reasons I like coming here.   Great TV viewing.  Bar has electrical outlets & USB ports!!! to charge run your devices.  Higher comfy bench seating in the bar area.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and our waitress was amazing. The menus were dirty and other customers were very loud. The wait on our food was a little longer then usual but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was kinda slow. There were an unusually high number of people here for 3pm on a Sunday. Can't go wrong with the Mac n cheese with chicken. Omg so good. My son liked the chicle tenders."}
{"text":"Three people, 47 dollars, for service that was mediocre at best.   (Examples) We had decided what we wanted to eat before our waitress came by to get our drink order. Clearly her time is far more important than mine. My burger was dry and take a blood pressure pill before you eat the French fries, extremely salty. The fries were suppose to be unlimited, however I didn't get that experience because my waitress never offered me more fries.   They have an electronic gizmo at the end of every table, but I have no idea what it is there for, waitress never explained. Our waitress did the bare minimum. She took our order, brought our food, and closed with the bill. I should of went to In n out. It's half the price, fresher food, and a pleasant staff.   To be fair, I must say the manager was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Beware your beer glass   It has lips mark that is not washed off. The bartender who's young is snotty and very unfriendly unless you are a guy.  Manager is very aloof."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Staff has been attentive and accommodating every time. Burgers were well cooked. The drinks wete very well made also. This is consistent even when the place is packed"}
{"text":"This Applebee's is by far the best one I've ever been to.  Sometimes it's not the food or the drinks that make a place; its sometimes one person who genuinely loves their job and who makes every guest feel welcome...and at this location, Rob, who is behind the bar, is that person for us!  As soon as we walked in yesterday, Rob waved and smiled at us and nd proceeded to say how nice it was to see us again.  He does it for most people who sit by the bar but that's because we all know and love seeing him!!! Rob is awesome and he makes this location our go-to place!  Oh ...the food and beverages are good too!  Thanks Rob!  If I had anything to say it would be that I was disappointed that the wedge salad is no longer on the menu but rob recommended the Asian chicken for me and it was delish!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my family yesterday and was disappointed. I knew my husband won\"t be able to finish his food coz he had to go to work so when it came out, the Manager, that is my assumption, asked us if we needed something else, i requested for A1 sauce for my husband and extra sauce for my daughter' s food. Well the A1 never got to our table and my husband left.without it. My daughter's extra sauce we had to ask our server. Water was not refilled and had to ask for it. We love applebees but yesterday wasn't an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight let's just say the service was horrible when the server said we were putting miles on her feet to get us drinks and half our party got food and finished while the others waited and when the food did arrive it was wrong and my grandmother ordered a steak that was a Mistake dry and over cooked being in this industry I would not recommend this place to any one . This is for sure the worst service I've ever had :("}
{"text":"Oh where to start! The food is less than desirable especially since I had a pubic hair in my salad! It was way too crowded and we were seated next to a very large of noxious group of people. Instead of the waitress realizing that we were uncomfortable and asking them to quiet down a bit she just went about her business as if nothing was going on. Shows a lack of effort! More than anything though the food is just not good! Go to Chili's instead!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food at a fair price.  This restaurant is good for families as well as adult groups. Plenty of variety in  the menu so that everyone can find something they like."}
{"text":"Yesterday, me and my mom went to this location to get lunch. As we were eating, my mom noticed something long and black in her pasta, which ended up being someone's long black piece of hair (we both are blondes). The manager came over and took her food away and gave my mom something else. She also stated that we would not have to pay for anything due to us both losing our appetite. Then, 20 minutes later, I got the bill for my food and to pay for both our drinks. I may sound cheap, but watching my mom twirl hair was not worth the $17."}
{"text":"I usually don't order meals online. I prefer to call the restaurant. They had a simple online ordering, I ordered a meal for curbside pick up, received a confirmation email, went to the restaurant sat there for 10 minutes called the restaurant phone number and was told sorry we have no specialist tonight. Then I was hung up on!So much for customer service!!"}
{"text":"As an family classic, the food is rather disappointing for its price. Although the menu offers a wide range of food, the quality and tastes of the dishes need some improvement. I personally would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice since moving to Laveen in July 2010.  Both times we had good waitstaff and both times we happened to arrive during the early evening happy hour and ordered 1/2 price drinks and appetizers.  The food and drinks were both good.  This is a typical Applebee's but unlike several of the past reviewers we have yet to experience bad service here.  We would probably come here more during the 1/2 price timeframes but we like to try to experience more local restaurants too.  We will definitely be making more trips here in the future."}
{"text":"On a cold blistery snowy day, it is REALLY chilly by the door. We had some customers who were in the table beside us requesting another table, because it was too cold! They should modify their doors or at least erect some kind of barrier, the constant chill was uncomfortable throughout the meal.  For the price they charge I was expecting slightly larger portions or at least good food, but they were neither. The portions seemed skimpy and the potatoes were plain. But by far it was the vegetables that were the worst part of the meal. The broccoli and baby carrots were way too overcooked. When you cannot even use your fork to spear the broccoli, you have got major problems. In retrospect, when our group walked in, my friend noted that most everybody was \"older\", now I know why...  On the other hand, dessert was good. Service was prompt, even though we had the server from another table converse with us before she realized and suddenly said \"Oh, sorry, I thought you were my table\".  Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We just returned from a Valentine's Day dinner. We arrived at 5:10 to beat the crowd and it was already packed. We walked in, we were greeted by Sam. My husband asked for a good seat. Sam found us a great booth. We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu. Our waiter was attentive and pleasant. My husband got ribs that were cold. He sent them back immediately. When Keith brought them back he waited while my husband tasted them. They were warm so he was fine. I got a pasta dish that I can never finish but it was good, as usual.  Overall, I was pleased particularly with how busy it was."}
{"text":"Best Classic burger in town, hand made, not the round patty."}
{"text":"I just love this location! Employees are great. Food comes really fast. Great prices. Great menu. I will never get sick of Applebee's."}
{"text":"Great food. Randy and Tammy are the best servers ever, I'd ask for them for an even better experience but all around a great restaurant regardless. Friendly staff, always clean :)"}
{"text":"Honestly the worst meal I have had in 25 years.  I did complain after the fact and the manager offered a free meal for my friend and I.  I can't do it. Even if the food got better .....how good could it really be.  The restaurant is tired and old. The menu is dated. The customers are elderly and if they like it great. Not my cup of tea thanks. Service was good."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Applebees and never get tired of the food or decore but I found this one lacking. It is clean and has enough room for the local but the service is sub par to say the least. And they were stingy on the portions which was a surprise, given what I've gotten at other Applebee restaurants. The service often makes the restaurant and in this case the staff seemed run down and forgetful, they took forever to get a glass of water! My advice if you still want to go to this Applebees be prepared to repeat yourself a lot and have a lot of patience."}
{"text":"Not recommended.   The food was awful. I had the Orange Chicken bowl. I'm pretty sure they used sawdust to batter the chicken before they fried it. It was really poor.   The music was loud and obnoxious. A complete mismatch with the octogenarians that filled the place. Mercifully for them, their hearing was probably dulled with the passing years. Sadly, mine has not. Also, I don't think most of them were particularly interested in the UFC review that was on the three or four TVs tuned to Spike TV.   The service was cheerful but annoying. I can't remember the last time I encountered wait staff so intent on up-selling. I've had my arm bent less at timeshare condo expos."}
{"text":"Great lunch... We did the 2 for $24  food was awesome.  The service was also great Doree took great care of us our drinks were never empty and she made sure to keep checking on us to make sure we were ok.  Great Applebee's to eat at"}
{"text":"I will not eat at this Applebee's again. I ordered to go. The food was cold, very greasey and did not taste good. The salad I payed almost $4.00 for was tiny and limp. The only thing that my family ordered that was good was the ranch dressing."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Applebee's. The service has been at least solid but most of the time above average the food is right on par and even when busy comes out in a timely manner. They only thing to be careful of is on Friday nights during high school football season the place is PACKED with high schoolers it gets loud and obnoxious quickly"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I really want to like as it's close to home and incredibly convenient. The problem is it just keeps falling short. It's like an employee who is a little too good to fire and not good enough to want to keep. There's always something good, and something bad when I go here. With most orders, such as the cedar plank salmon, the main thing, the salmon is good. The mixed veggies on the other hand are limp and cooked to mush. The burger one orders might be great, but the fries are cold. If the food is all good the service is bad. The place never seems to put it all together.  Also the menu seems to get a little more stale all the time. The place could and should be better than it is."}
{"text":"This place is nasty, piss all over in the mens room. The service is slow and the staff all look like meth heads. One waitress for 10 tables and she was clueless. Took 20 minutes to order our meal. This says alot for the management, last time we visit this place."}
{"text":"Manager made us feel very comfortable.. we love our server, \"Princess\" Diana..  My husband and i were seated & served promptly. #Excellentservice"}
{"text":"This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!"}
{"text":"Food was ok and would eat it again, had to wait 50 minutes or so for a takeaway order though and the package it came in leaked with no warning that there was loose sauce in it."}
{"text":"Tori is the kindest most polite manager of any restaurant we have ever been to. The other Tempe Applebee's on broadway was rude to my husband because he has Alzheimer's disease. Tori treated him with only kindness and  respect. Thank you tori. From bob and  marilyn."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I have to give this place two stars tonight. I've been here before enjoyed the food and experience, but tonight must've been amateur night. I came with family; the burger (medium) and ribs came out just fine, however the steak (well done) came out bloody. I expressed my concern to the waiter (don't know his name, he didn't introduce himself) and nothing was done, he just said \"I'll tell somebody.\" And we received our normal military discount, no special treatment. My guess is that the waiter is new, due to his lack of problem-solving skills and dumbfounded look. I would also bet a paycheck that the waiter is new. I'm sure he dropped all the meat at once and didn't ensure that the meals were cooked because he didn't want us to wait for our food. Perfectly fine, except that one of us didn't eat because of it.  The worst part: the restaurant was so slow! I will be in no rush to return."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love all the applebees. The combination dinners, one appetizer and two entree deals are the best. The best part is that they accept spc!! Great for students with it.  The atmosphere is great, a homey feeling. The food was good, it was a bit of a smaller portion than the one in Niagara, but it was still good. I went here for Mother's Day and got seating right away! I love their artichoke dip, and the calamari was just so tasty, but it was kinda over deepfried, but regardless still good."}
{"text":"It doesn't even deserve 1 star, but wont let me do no stars. Applebees I am very disappointed in you I ordered your food for pick up. Got my food home none of the sauces were right, I had 3 small pieces of chicken on the pasta,My mozzarella sticks were burnt. Ordered a chicken fajita wrap which I always do and once again disappointed smallest thing I've seen, It looks like it should of been for a child."}
{"text":"Jasmine was great. We had a lot of questions and they were all answered perfectly. I am picky about my food due to my health and accommodated my special diet with no questions and no rolling of the eyes. They worked with me. I liked the bubbly Hostess will open the doors for us and greeted us with a very cheery attitude and when we left said goodbye to us as well I didn't get her name but she was fantabulous. The sweet potatoes that were mashed where the bomb. I liked that the TVs were on the Olympics as well so we can catch up from our long trip up to New York this weekend."}
{"text":"I went out for dinner with my family on Sunday. I've been to Applebee's a couple times. I have to say I am never going back. The service was lacking and the food was terrible. As soon as I went home I was sick. The food poisoning I got from there lasted 3 days. It was terrible. I really hope nobody else got sick."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and will probably not go back. It was a weeknight. Ordered the 2 for 20 special car side to-go.  Got two burgers and fries.  Ordered the burgers pink but what I got was pretty charred on the outside and could only be considered very well done.  My burger and fries were also cold. They quoted me 20 minutes,  I arrived in 20 minutes.  Not worth $20. I would give less than 1 star if I could. I should.have saved 9 bucks (with tip) and got fast food; it would have been faster and better than this!"}
{"text":"Yesterday 12/18 I order a clubhouse sandwich. First the fries were very cold, second as I take a bite of the sandwich i bite in a plastic wrap!!!!! It was soooo nasty!! I lost my appetite. The manager never came to apologies which I thought it was so disrespectful. Horrible horrible experience!"}
{"text":"The waitress forgot our silverware and straws until halfway though the meal. The menu was very overwhelming, repetitive, and very disorganized. The food was very salt. I had the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken. The mac and cheese was soupy(very watery), and the fact that the chicken was in the mac and cheese made the chicken soggy. There was also random food bits in the mac and cheese. Things like beans, hunks of bacon, burnt slices of bacon, slices of what appears to be onions, and ?basil?. The waitress and staff were very nice though, despite their apparent rushing around. The staffing seemed to be jumping around filling different positions. I saw hostesses frequently balancing the hostessesing and returning the dishes to the kitchen"}
{"text":"I am not an Applebee's fan, but my daughter wanted to go. It was a week night so it was pretty tame service wise. Everyone was very nice and attentive. The food was so so but it always is with Applebee's. The manager held the door open for us when we left and that was a good ending touch."}
{"text":"This was bad experience from the start. We had a party of 3 (my wife, my father and myself). There were at least 4 open booths in plain view from the waiting area. It wasn't terribly busy. The hostess wouldn't sit me and my wife until the third person in my party arrived. She said she was sorry but they are busy. I insisted on being sat and she looked as though I peed in her morning coffee.   Once sat, we met our waitress. Which was one of the three times we talked to her all night. She took our drink order, didn't see her until she took our dinner order, then another time to get a refill on our drinks (which we had to ask for from one of the managers since we hardly saw our waitress.   I think part of the trouble is this new system from Applebee's with the touch screens at each table. From this screen, you can order your dinner, ask for refills, pay your bill and a few other functions. I really wish when we sat down or first met the server they gave a quick rundown on all I could do. It's great you can do all these things, but I had to \"request\" a refill via the touch screen. Our waitress passed our table several times and never once actually talked to us to see if we would like a refill.   The food was ok. It wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't terrible. The best part of the entire experience was being able to pay the bill at the table. The worst of it is that I've been to this same Applebee's a few years back, and the service was terrible then as well. Bad service is weighing this location down."}
{"text":"The service sucked when we first got there the little  girl who was the hostess didn't know what she was doing she sat people who came in after us we only had a party of 4 and she was sitting everyone else who had a party of 4 or more as well!! We finally got seated took the waitress a while for her to come get our drink order!!! The food was good and came out pretty fast!!!! When we needed refills she didn't come to the table probably because she was to busy talking to another waitress and not paying attention to her tables"}
{"text":"The food wasn't all that great and overpriced for what it was.  I had the 4 cheese mac n cheese with honey BBQ boneless chicken tenders.   The mac n cheese part was not bad but the chicken was really greasy.  My wife had the double shrimp which was really greasy too.  We're both a little queasy from all the grease.  They even charged us for an extra side of ranch for dipping the fries in.  And she didn't even end up eating the fries.  The service wasn't too bad considering we went there on a Friday night and they were really busy.   Overall,  we were very disappointed and most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Go early, before 6pm and get their burgers for 6.99. I tried their Beer Garden burger with sweet potato fries and I am glad I did. The Beer Garden burger is loaded with great flavor and I will definitely go back to get it again! I ate at the bar and watched and had discussions with the bartender about the Olympics. It was a very nice, relaxing, good flavored time."}
{"text":"Went in a while back had Brittney as a server, and everything was absolutely horrible. If you get her as a server just leave because she will ruin your day, night or whatever time of day it is. She charged us for playing games, when we didn't even have one at our table. we asked for apps to come out before food and it all came out at same time she said \" sorry I couldn't get the apps out any quicker the cooks are a little behind \" and all our food was cold! We waited 57 min for food I'm sure it was sitting back there for a good 20 min. We haven't been back and won't be going back we drive all the way to dysart instead of going here and we live half a mile from here!"}
{"text":"Upon dining at this restaurant I was sadly disappointed. Not only did my medium well steak come out bloody, and my \"pink center\" hamburger come out completely brown through the center it took us over 40 minutes to get our food. Not a good time at this applebees, unlike others."}
{"text":"After working in the service industry for 4 years, I understand how a restaurant is ran. Our server Brooke was horrible. Took a while to get our food order, had a horrible attitude, and very passive aggressive. After we waited over 30 mins for our food she handed out food to us purposely allowing the smoke to go in our faces. When we asked for boxes because we were upset she just said okay and walked away with out asking if anything was wrong. After waiting another 5 mins, she finally picked up the check. As she did it she snapped the book and walked away. It was also horrible seeing the way she talked to other staff members, mainly the bartender. Also hygiene was an issue. Worst service I've had ever!"}
{"text":"I only put one star because I had to. This was the wprst service ever. Once they sat us down noone came to greet us. The host didnt even inform us who our waiter was. No one came to take our drink order or anything. We sat there for 20 mins then left. There were easily 6 people working and only about 4 tables of people."}
{"text":"Always go to Applebee's for the good specials at home in Minnesota, so it was highly disappointing to visit this location. We waited for happy hour which I thought to restaurants meant good deals for their consumers on normally sized items, but to this location or maybe all Pennsylvania locations happy hour only means prorated meals for a prorated over price. Well that's not why I came to Applebee's for happy hour. It is however the reason I will not return. I didn't bother complaining to management because I don't want a gift card to come back. That what I was trying to use up. A gift card. Thanks. Don't worry, I didn't stiff your waitress either, she tried. And I never went to a place with trivia where you had to pay to play?"}
{"text":"This place  was not even worth 1 star we sat there for a while no one attended us. I will never. Go back to the place. So we end up going to Dennys and they WERE GREAT"}
{"text":"a bit of a bumpy start to the night. took a bit before anyone showed up to our table. the bartender noticed, and ended up getting us and taking our drink orders and appetizer orders. then 2 other people stopped by to try and do the same.   so a but of confusion there.   we ended up having the bartender (tyler) remain as our waiter. and he was awesome.   very attentive, kept our glasses full, and didn't leave us to long although still tending the bar.   food came quickly, and was very good. I had the 9oz sirloin as a main dish, and the boyfriend and I had soft pretzels with beer cheese dip and mozzarella sticks as an app.   all prepared/served as ordered.  Overall we were pretty happy.  I honestly don't think the experience would have been the same if we had a different server"}
{"text":"Love this place if you ever come in make sure to get \"Donald's \" section.  He has awesome customer service and he is just plain cool."}
{"text":"Me and my girl went here 2 days ago! The worst service I've had in a good while.  When we first arrived there was no one at the podium to greet like all other Applebee's do. We stood there for approximately 5 minutes before anyone came and seated us. After the guy seated us, 5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, 15 minutes went by. NO ONE ELSE CAME!!! Finally I got up and went to the bar to ask the bartender for two glasses of water with lemon. The bartender states: no one came to help to you guys yet? I said: no but can I have two glasses of water until they come? Bartender: let me go get them Me: waiting for my water..... no water. He dismiss me and said they will come. By this time I'm furious!! Finally a waiter came and asked the craziest thing have we been helped! I said no!! He is apoplectic and ect... but I don't care. Saying how they are short handed and stuff.  My thing is communication! The first guy who sat us knew they were short could have said something! communicate to your customers . So I asked to speak to the manager. Manager never came! And we never got out water.   So we left and gave our business across the street to Friday's!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! I ordered a medium rare 12 oz steak. But instead, they delivered me a medium well almost a well done steak. Manager talked to me and delivered me another steak. Guess what? It's the same!! Their manager does not have problem solving skills. I'm done with Applebee's. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Good place to drink and eat.Food is real good.Chicken wings traditional and shrimp salad are tasty.This is a place where we will go again and again.The ambience is excellent.Enjoy with family and friends.Service is fast but the bartenders are not friendly;they are professionals who prefer to work without a smile."}
{"text":"Not that great. In fact, I don't think I'll be coming back. The prices are average for this type of chain restaurant. The food quality however is sub par. Rubber steak, over cooked, everything is drenched in some sort of sauce to try to cover up the poor quality.   If you just want drinks, maybe. But the appetizers aren't that appealing, so why bother."}
{"text":"On July 2nd, 2015, we visited this Applebee's.  When we walked in we were greated by the hostess & told us to have a seat while she got a table ready.  When we were seated at our table, it was still wet from being cleaned & the menus were sticking to the table.  We had to wait 10 minutes for our server, Marc S. to come greet us and take our drink order.  He then took a long time to bring us our drinks & when he brought our drinks, he didn't bring my beer.  We didn't get any napkins or silverware when we were seated or when we finally got our drinks.  Marc finally brought my beer & took our order.  When he brought us our food, we still didn't have any napkins or silverware.  He brought us 2 napkins & 3 forks.  He never came back to check up on us.  We finished our drinks, and we wanted refills were wanted & I wanted another beer.  We sat at our table with no drinks trying to eat our food for at least 20 mins.  That is unacceptable.  I had to ask the hostess to have Marc come back.  He finally came over and we ordered refills.  Throughout our experience there & with Marc, he wasn't personable at all & not a pleasant interaction with him.  I though Applebee's was supposed to be an upbeat fun place to go with our family & friends for a bite to eat, get some drinks & enjoy our experience.  This was my worst experience ever at this Applebee's & any other Applebee's for that matter.  Not planning on going there again anytime soon.  Very disappointing & a terrible experience."}
{"text":"My experience here is the actual reason I decided to start making reviews because of how bad this location is. We've been sitting & waiting for our food forever & had to constantly ask for more water. We find out over a half hour of sitting there that our waiter forgot to put in our order in. All the employees are irritating & overly FAKE happy. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, couldnt get our orders right, brought our food before our kids food. Didnt even give us silverware or napkins or plates for our appetizer. When they did bring plates, they were wet! Horrible."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & fresh food. Very busy on weekend nights, including Fridays. Eat here nearly every week. Chips & salsa are a great & cheap apitizer, plus there's an unlimited amount."}
{"text":"Loved our server Renee! So kind and loving! Made us feel like part of the family! Definitely coming back! Amazing food and great service!"}
{"text":"Our server Shariah was phenomenal and when the quesadilla burger came out just slightly different then how I'd asked for it (yet still delicious! )the manager thanked us (for not being rude I guess). She then comped our baby's meal and brought us free desert and personally thanked us for our patronage . Probably one of the best experiences We have had anywhere ever!! Totally going back!!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the food is ok, the Manager at 44th street & Thomas has to be less passive to annoing customers who play their rap music on their cell phones. I doubt that we will revisit that establishment anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Precooked meals that taste microwaved."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED  Date of visit 2/13/16 5:10 pm   Checked in with a party of five and told 20-25 minutes. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting, noticed the hostess was telling everyone that came in 20-25 minutes, but nobody was being seated although I was able to count at least 6 empty tables. Right near where we were waiting there were two tables for 2 open as well as a booth for 4. In the main dining room I could see a large corner table that would seat 6, a combination table (bench & highbacks) that would seat 5 or 6 and a booth that could seat 4.  After about 20 minutes, I tried, but couldn't locate a manager to ask why they weren't sitting anyone in those open areas so I asked a server. She couldn't tell me why, but one of the bartenders chimed in and said, \"they are backed-up in the kitchen and that's why they weren't seating anyone hoping to catch up.\" I responded with, \"well you are getting a bit backed-up out the front door and she keeps telling EVERYONE 20-25 minutes!?!\"  I continued with, \"Wouldn't it make more sense to seat people 1) to clear the entrance and 2) to at least get some drink & appetizer sales while the kitchen catches up?\"  It was amazing how quickly they then started seating people in the empty areas.  Once seated, we were quickly greeted. However, two of us at the table were still trying to read the menu as it was SO dark we had to use the flashlight on our phones in order to read the menus. Our server tried, but she was very awkward, socially.  Couldn't tell if she was trying too hard or frustrated with being very busy???  Food was mediocre at best. Wife said she has had better chicken strips at home from the frozen food section. I had the Blazin' Texan burger. It was OK, but definitely not worth what it cost!  I will say the fries were very good.  In summary, very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My Fianc√© and i decided to make a quick dinner date after some father's day shopping and thought applebee's would be a good stop. We arrived a little after 7pm and were greeted by the NICEST waiter AJ. He got our order and was super polite and quick! However thats where the trouble started. We both ordered steaks and 2 sides. We waited for the food for over an hour. AJ made multiple trips to the table apologizing for the delay and stated someone else kept taking his tables orders. After we got our food and ate we had been at the table for 2 HOURS! I cannot say enough how amazing AJ was but 2 hours for steak is insane. Don't stop by unless you got a few hours to kill.   Just as a quick edit here there were multiple tables seated after us that ate and had left before our food even hit the table!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. OK place, but keeps sliding downhill. This time the first place they seated us was freezing - we were shivering so bad it was hard to talk. Others around us said they were freezing also. Host checked and told us it couldn't be adjusted. He moved us. New spot was OK.  Food was really greasy and mostly tasteless - not our previous experience with Applebee's. Service was very good.  The major problem this time was the music - blaring so loud overhead that it felt like we were being beat up - it was mentally exhausting. We were there to relax over dinner - impossible. The waitress said that people constantly complain, but the manager won't turn it down.... Huh... OK...."}
{"text":"Well to start off, I was there the other night with some friend's. We were at the bar having a good time but noticed the bartender wasn't paying attention  to any one at the bar. It wasn't just us. As we started to acknowledge this with other people it became evident that he was not concerned with us. This is not the first time he acted that way . It would make sense that if he's not happy to work some where else. Every time we here him talk it always about the store and how poorly  it is beening run. Please help I'm here to speak for everyone who goes the tee and is tires of Dan the angry bartender.   Sign The paying customers."}
{"text":"Our meal went somehow terribly wrong, from drink orders to lunch orders to timely delivery. Spoke to the manager, Deborah, and she made a bad situation better. Everyone has a bad day occasionally, I'm hoping that was all it was for our server.  Once we all got the correct (and hot) orders, lunch was tasty. Nonetheless, Deborah turned an \"I won't be coming back here\" into a \"We'll give it another shot\", and that deserves some recognition."}
{"text":"This visit which will be my last..worst service I've ever experienced.  Had to wait to be be seated. .no hostess until the manager acknowledged us. 35 min wait to receive our food. Service was less than you should ever expect.  Was held hostage to get our check and get out..which is why I have time to write this review. .avoid this location unless you're into bondage and mental torture."}
{"text":"Apparently don't come here a Sunday afternoon. We have been here an hour and still haven't got our food. Food was old, dry and cold. Better food at a dive bar."}
{"text":"The restaurant has decent, but not great food at this establishment. There are better options in the area. The service was timely and the staff was personable."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person when it comes to food or anything but I was disappointed with the service and food. They advertise their new app where you can order your food and pick it up in my area so my fiance and I decided to try it out. We ordered this 2 for $20 deal because we've never tried their food before. We got this chicken basket with fries with Caesar side salads.   Food: Salad was good. The chicken seemed kind of old; I almost would have preferred to go to McDonald's and order their chicken strips. The fries were also sub-par. 2/5  Service: When we first went in they forgot to give us our other chicken basket, our credit card, and plastic utensils. So the attention to detail is lacking or they are not prepared to do on-the-go orders. 1/5  I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy Applebees.   Seating was prompt and friendly.  The food was average.  My Chicken Freshcado, so named for the fresh ingredients, was reported to include avacado.  I found one quarter inch cube of avacado in the salsa on top of the indifferently grilled chicken.  The Three Cheese Penne did, indeed, have three cheeses.  We counted the little piles of cheese grated on top.  Our server, Deborah, seemed like she wanted to be elsewhere.  I sort of wished she had been.  While not quite surley, she was not a happy camper.  What really stood out though was that she had her fingers IN  our food dishes.  Every dish I saw her touch, not just at my table, had her fingers touching parts people might eat off of.  The water pitcher was no exception.  She had her thumb inside that as well.  If you are concerned about germs, choose a different restaurant.  On the plus side, the Strawberry Quencher Lemonade was Great!"}
{"text":"\"Went for lunch at my 4 yr old's request. NEVER AGAIN. Server (Maira) more concerned with relatives at next table and my son's steak was gray, un-cuttable and cold. Manager was napping at the counter.\" Wasn't busy, just bad."}
{"text":"Went in a few weeks ago. Long wait, cold food, waste of 60$. The only good was the margarita"}
{"text":"My wife and I like this location.It was recently updated, the staff is friendly, the food is good, the menu is often refreshed. My favorite dish is out of season right now but it is the margareta chicken with shrimp and avacodos."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but this is something that is unacceptable. I saw that there were two new managers I asked where Rafael and Shavonda were because I normally talk to them in delight (my family eats regularly here) and I liked the new manager, the tall man, I think his name was Leon. But anyways the other one was a short Latina lady, and man was she rude, her name starts with a B or something. I saw her yell at an employee not once but TWICE on different occasions. She looks like she tries to please customers which is good but... it is UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISGUSTING to chew someone out in front of paying customers. She had a terrible attitude with them from what I could hear. I can't believe that a person would humiliate a server on the resteraunt floor. I've had years of experience as a manager at different food chains and I can say that seeing that was truly sad. I love Applebee's but I just had to write about it, I hope that they don't condone that behaviour in the future with her. Anyways great food and great music."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service! Upon walking in, there was no host/hostess at all. I stood there awkwardly waiting for at least a minute or two before I was even acknowledged. After I was finally seated, I sat there for at least 5 minutes before the waiter (Troy, I believe) said he would be right with me. I was waiting for my friend to arrive, but he still did not come back to even ask what I wanted to drink. I sat there for 20 minutes (my friend finally arrived by then) before he came over to see what we wanted. After being starving from not eating much all day, my patience was pretty thin. After waiting so long, what I wanted was a sincere apology, but instead he tried to brush it off with some humor instead. I never got a refill on my drink even once. The waiter also acted extremely unprofessional and talked to us like one of his \"buds.\" I asked him if something on the menu was good and he even said \"I try not to eat where I work so I don't really know.\" This is the second time I have received terrible service at this location so I will NOT be returning here. The only reason I even came back was because I had a gift card for Applebee's and it was the closest location to me. Go somewhere else for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Our server was Sam and she was great!! Pleasant and helpful with any questions we had.  Food was really good!!"}
{"text":"\"Horrible service. Food seemed to be doused in salt! Not worth the wait at all.\""}
{"text":"Stopped in for the oriental salad. Had a wait so sat at bar. Ended up with southwestern steak salad. It was great. 12 dog beer on tap large 625. Service was great and bartenders very attentive."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge Applebee's fan but I have gone here three Thursday nights in a row!  I bring a buddy and get chips and salsa during their karaoke time. Servers are super friendly."}
{"text":"I walked out. I went to have a late lunch with my husband and stood at the hostess podium for about 5 minutes and nobody acknowledged me.  There were at least 5 employees that saw us standing there and none bothered to even say hello, they have lost my business forever."}
{"text":"After going to another Applebees regularly, we started having very negative experiences, and this location is closer to our house. We have always had wonderful service since the day we started coming here. If anything negative has happened, it was minimal enough that it's been forgotten. I have to be dairy free, and they were extremely accommodating in my requests with my steak dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. I haven't been here in years, but I will be back. I was very impressed by the selection, quality and price of food. I had the pepper steak with grains and it was prepared perfectly and delicious. The portion size was just right, but I did have have starter salad. I also recommend the mango tea, it's unsweetened. Enjoyed lunch and I will return."}
{"text":"Never got to eat. I go into the Applebees on 44th street. There was an employee up front, but she never even looked at me. It's nice if someone says hello, or something. I think the place has gone down hill some. Not just because they ignored me but because they used to have a decent steak, but the last couple times I tried it, it was expensive and food quality is going down in my opinion.  I called them up and told them thanks for nothing. I also told them there is a restaurant right next door. This is where I am eating right now. I haven't been to Applebee's on 44th street in a good year and I know it will be at least another year or two, if I ever go back. They hung up on me when I criticized on the phone but I had the last word. Maybe they  think it's a good thing when your too busy for your customers. Even an idiot can figure out that taking care of the front is as important as keeping ice tea and water glasses full. I bet they don't know that, lol."}
{"text":"The worst food ever. I can't believe they charge for that crap..the highlight was the waitress Kaitlyn amazing!!"}
{"text":"Ya know, I don't know what the hell I was expecting but here goes nothing. For some reason all the other Applebee's in the Pitt area are better than this one. The wait staff used to be great, then it took a dive and now they're starting to improve again but they aren't the main issue. The kitchen is terrible. Everything that comes out tastes like it was cooked in the microwave. The pasta, the steaks and even the burgers don't taste quite right. At other locations your food preparation is a lot better. Normally with this type of food people won't care because the ingredients are typically low quality, but when prepped hastily its just a mess. The only thing that was ever prepped right was the appetizers if it wasn't busy. I know firsthand from friends that the cook staff are overworked, understaffed and underpaid and its really not right when my bill tops off at $30."}
{"text":"Slow service and fair food. Our food, two chicken dishes took well over 30 mins to get to the table. While they are trying to set the mood of a local bar, they fall well short of that goal. The staff seemed to be more concerned about talking with each other than taking care of the customers."}
{"text":"Terrible to go service... Placed the order, told it would be ready in 15 minutes only to arrive at the given time and find out that it was never entered in their system... I'm still waiting for my food 30 minutes later. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Service is so bad here! My waiter was so bad that I had to tip the host because she cared more about my service then my own waiter.  I love apple bees to bad I have to drive further out to get better service"}
{"text":"Very bad service and food for higher price. I am surprised they are still open. We went three times- service and food were awful. Don't waste your times and money on this join. I don't think I ever seen anyone working there- even manager was talking and hanging out. No more......."}
{"text":"Our waiter was the pits He forgot our salads and then when he did bring them he made a joke of it. When our meals arrived we asked for refills never happened When he came back around to check on us he said to just flag him down if we needed anything Food was decent but the waiter was just either trying to cover his butt for his lousy service or just plain lazy"}
{"text":"I really like the Applebee's lunch specials.  I'm sad that the Applebee's location on Gilbert/202 closed. This Applebee's is just as good. The food is delicious and the servers are great."}
{"text":"We eat at Applebee's often but a recent visit prompted this review. I had a bowl of Tomato Basil Bisque soup that was really bad. It tasted like tomato puree out of the can and they served it to me lukewarm, not even hot. I think Applebee's should take note and not serve such below par food items. This soup was not really fit to eat."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, the server named Maria was very uninvolved the food selection process. She had a very bad persona about herself,when asked on different selections and varieties of food she was very nonchalant about the responses in which she gave. I would not recommend this particular location to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about applebee's, but every time I go there, im sick that night. This has been ongoing for about 15 years now. I'll eat, get sick, wont go there for a few years, and it will happen again every time! Everything seems to taste the same on 1 dish, like its all cooked together."}
{"text":"Well, I have loved going to this chain for over 20 years now.  And I have been to this one several times, and always been at ease.  My visit here this weekend was jarring to me.  It was like everything they were just got kicked out the door. Our waiter did not know what was on draft, and they didn\"t have any after she took 1/2 hour to check that.  We ordered three app's and our entree's.  The place is empty, and after an hour we got our main dishes and no side dishes.  Then  the waitress sat down next to me tell us that she has to cash us out, because she has to go on vacation.  Don't go here"}
{"text":"It was alright, seasonal vegies were bitter and inedible, steak was blah, dessert and appetizer were good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday lunch. We where met as soon as we entered and was seated. The waiter asked us immediately what we wanted to drink. Our drinks came out in a reasonable amount of time. While waiting for   Our food I needed  my drink refilled. I looked for our waiter but could not see him or anyone to get a refill. After waiting for a while I got up and went to the bar and got my own refill. We received our food and about half way through the meal we both needed drinks. Again I looked for someone but no one around. Finally got the attention of the waiter and asked for more drinks. I had to do this two times before we got our drinks. As I watched around the  restaurant  it appeared they where under staffed. Our food was just OK nothing to brag about. Probably will not go back here for a while."}
{"text":"We came in about 2:30 in the afternoon, not many other customers around and our service was extremely slow, for a party of four. One of the forks we were given still had food on it, it took some real effort to get our drinks refilled while we waited for our food. Finally had to get up and get a new fork, couldn't find anyone to help.The food was extremely salty and service was pretty bad, I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered the wan ton stir fry I got three pieces of broccoli no wan ton strips... Hello stir frys have vegetables in there not just rice not happy with my food here today"}
{"text":"The food may not be that great, but the drinks made by Sidney are delicious! I'm definitely coming back for happy hour again!"}
{"text":"Ordered online. When I picked up my order, I was missing an entree. After asking about it, I was told they were out of Sirloin. I was charged for it and wasn't told this as I paid and walked out. I walked back in and was treated like I was trying to scam them!!  Will NEVER order from again and may never bother with any Applebee's."}
{"text":"Service sucks at this location  Cassidy was out server. Waited 15 minutes for drinks. Crappy crappy crappy experience"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Applebees last night and it was not good!!  We tried the 2 for $20 promotion.  We had chicken wings for the appetizer and they were to heavy on the tobasco sauce with no real other flavor.  My wife had the cajun shrimp and pasta and I had the riblet basket.  The pasta contain pieces of uncooked pasta and could not be eaten.  The riblet basket had two tiny slabs of riblets with a very strong flavor of tenderizer.  I also received 11 french fries on my plate!  Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"Food sucks . Wings and celery are from east Sudan : Ethiopia ( stale and cold and no meat on them ) management should consider closing down. Not a good place to eat at all"}
{"text":"Definently going back. Went their lastnight and Dustin took care of me and my wife best service ever Thank You Dustin because of you we will be back soon. Drinks and Food were great."}
{"text":"Service was slow our waitress never came back after food was served had to get the manager to pay the bill it's all good tho just probably won't go back there smh crazy cause back in the day that was the spot ...it's lost its luster"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, which we never do. Great personal attention from Mike and Joey. Changed the TV to the D backs game for us and had enjoyable conversation with both of them. Food was typically Applebee's and good. Will go back."}
{"text":"i went to this place on Saturday night and the two ghetto hostesses  literally had their heads down on the front desk. I had to ask them if they were open and they responded rudely then stared at me as if they didn't know what I wanted. I finally requested that I have a seat and I sat waiting for several minutes when I saw the waiter who looked like he was either high or very tired and not interested in working there. After I saw the first 3 employees, I decided that I was going to leave. I will never ever ever go to that Applebees.  It seemed like the place didn't have a manager on duty. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the fajitas and waitress failed to offer this with that (horrible concoction they call special sauce) on the side. It was so bad, my husband who will eat anything could not stomache that disgusting product. When it was addressed to the manager on duty, well lets say he tried to blame us for it...really.  Needless to say, he and who ever came up with this horrible mexican version of a fajitas do not need to work in the food service industry [especially in Arizona, where everyone knows what they are suppose to taste like].  We've ate at many Applebee's and nothing about any of them is great but this particular one will keep me from accepting even mediocre from any of them in the future. Way to go, Applebee's, serve us horrible food with managers trying to save you a dollar and you will never see my dollar again.  Another customer gone for good."}
{"text":"I love this Applebee's! The people here are really friendly and have great service. Jeff is my favorite waiter, he's the best! The food is really good and the service is prompt. I'm giving them 5 stars because they deserve it."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give 0 stars I would. First of all the cooks are atrocious. They don't know how to properly cook steak. I asked for medium, but when I cut into the steak I basically had to use a chainsaw to cut it up. Then it was more than 50% pink. I returned it and got a different steak and still received a horrible excuse for a medium steak. Not only did they mess up my order, but they messed up my girlfriend's steak too. She asked for medium+ and got well done. Might as well have given her a leather belt. Second, the waitress and manager weren't even sympathetic about messing up my order 3 times. At the end of the day, I gave up and didn't even bother ordering anything else. 0/10 would not recommend. The boca park location is 1000 times better than this pathetic excuse of an applebees. They didn't even offer any compensation for their shitty service. Still had to pay for bullshit food"}
{"text":"This Applebee's is by far one of my favorites.  The general manager Lauren Pierce always make sure every guest has what they need and goes above and beyond.  It is clear that this staff enjoys their work and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Had a great burger at this Applebees. This is a typical, run of the mill chain restaurant and if you're looking for an applebees to deliver, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The one star is for the manager that gave us a $10 off our next visit. We will NOT be going to this location though. We did the 2 for $25 deal with the 4 cheese mac and cheese and the bourbon street chicken and shrimp and spinach artichoke dip for the appetizer. The appetizer was luke warm the cheese wasn't even melted. The plate had barbeque sauce and american cheese on it....When the food came out after an hour wait the Mac and Cheese was only warm on the bottom so clearly it was zapped in the microwave. The chicken on the mac and cheese was barely warm and didnt even have the glaze on it. The skillet the bourbon street chicken came out on was cool to the touch when it should have been sizzling. The mushrooms, onions, potatoes and shrimp were also cold. The only thing that was hot was the chicken. When our waitress finally surfaced she asked how the food was and we both said okay and she asked what was wrong. She then told us they were going to remake the food but we didnt have time to wait so the manager came over and apologized and took care of our check and gave us the $10 off for our next visit. This is also the second time my order has been messed up at this location. Save yourself and go to another one in the area."}
{"text":"I just want to say straight of the bat this is the worst place to eat. We went here with family to have lunch, the service was ok. We ordered cheese pizza for toddler from kids menu, and bourbon chicken and shrimp along with Shrimp stir fry vegetables. All the food was tasteless and it felt like none of the ingredients used were fresh, especially the cheese on the pizza was horrible. None of us could even finish half of the food, it was that bad. After leaving we all felt like puking..I would never go there again to eat.."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 stars, I would. We went to this Applebees yesterday (Saturday night) around 11:30 pm before they were about to close. We ordered a couple of appetizers (half price) and a diet pepsi. The diet pepsi that they served was awful. It had no carbonation. When I told the server, she said they cant do anything about it, but however went back and got me a regular carbonated drink. At that point I knew that this was going to be an awful experience.  Our food came and it was OK. Sliders were super dry (meat was charred) but fries were OK. My boneless buffalo wings were good. After we finished we got the check and then all customer experiences went south.  First they brought our bill which were not discounted. When I pointed that out, our server said that it was a mistake and would correct it. When the corrected bill came, they still had overcharged me for the sliders. The normal sliders were $8.79 and they charged me $4.99 for half price. I don't know where they do their math, but perhaps they should take a basic arithmetic course to learn to divide.  She corrected it and we left the place with a horrible experience. Strangely, the manager never came to apologize or say anything about the whole incident. That really is unacceptable when you are making double errors in your service. Needless to say, we are never going to go back there. I think this store has gotten enough negative reviews over the past and it should not be even open.  Really , really bad experience."}
{"text":"The food sucks shrimp is paper thin and hard small cup of coleslaw the potato chips are great but come e four bones on per cook ribs cheese sauce is ok bit come bathroom is trashed"}
{"text":"We went there on Friday night Sept 23, 2016.  The restaurant wasn't busy and we had the worst service possible.  We were seated right away and it took 45 minutes to receive our food and only have came because they dropped the other half.  They remade the dropped food but that took another 25 minutes to make.  It was chicken tenders and cheese sticks.   The whole dining experience took roughly 1 1/2 hours.  Never again.  They need to reevaluate the staff at this location"}
{"text":"Prompt courteous service.  Great menu with lots of choices.   Best of all...good food."}
{"text":"First it was freezing cold. I ordered the half rack ribs that looked burnt to a crisp. And my lady's mac and cheese was cold as the waitress. Never returning to this restaurant. I take my serve safe this week. Makes me wonder what is going on in the back of this restaurant.  Plus waitress tells us food is being remade. Where's the manager? A dissatisfied customer regarding food quality. Lack of interest in customer satisfaction and well being. Is obviously not this manager's main concern."}
{"text":"Salad had wilted lettuce.  Sanitation grade 90.5.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Dan is the best bartender ever! We come here a few days a week and have the best time with him. The staff is awesome as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"We love Applebee's so we came after our Cirque de Soleil show, Angela and Amanda were awesome. They were able to accommodate well and love there enthusiastic energy. Thanks ladies you rock!"}
{"text":"Allergic reaction?! Hives?! Unexpected trip to the ER?! Read more to find out the rest!  Oh the classic onion peel tale... A tale of disappointment with a dash of pure unadulterated disgust. Onion peel in Mac cheese.......always my favorite   On a side note if you like cold chicken wings your in luck. Wings were borderline warm.   2 for $25 dinner turned into 2 for $300 dinner with a trip to the ER. All in all we won't be returning to Applebee's."}
{"text":"1 star for being 2 blocks away from work 1 star for serving super cheap, super large beers 1 star for being kicked out from an Applebee's -YES, AN APPLEBEE'S- after 5 super cheap, super large beers"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this place. Guess its because I only like their chips and queso/salsa and I live right down the street.   EVERYTIME I come here, I order \"to-go\" (the chips and salsa) and let me name a few thigns that I am really pissed at:   1) It takes someone forever (about 3-7 minutes) just to come and take my order at the to-go desk.   2) 2 girls who work there always ring up my chips & salsa for $5.95. Well tonight I went up there & a different girl was working there and she rang up chips and salsa/queso up for like $11!! I said \"Um no, you must have put it in wrong because I always only pay $5.95\" and she got her manager and he said the same thing. \"No it's 11.97\"....wtf? I said \"Well can you try to put it in a different way maybe? Because those other two girls do it...maybe try putting it in as like chips and salsa and a SIDE of queso or something???\" and he gets an attitude & says no that theres absolutely no way to do that.....wow really?    3) They finally bring out my chips and salsa and queso (yes I paid the $11) and they bring me a TINY cup of salsa! It was so small...I laughed and said are you serious....normally they give me a NORMAL sized container of salsa...no this microscopic thing, can you bring me a normal sized one considering I just paid ELEVEN dollars for this?\" and she brings out a bigger container of salsa and had an attitude and did not say thank you or sorry or one dam thing to me.   It was some mixed girl (black and white) or something..with a tattoo on her neck.   HORRIBLE!!!!   Oh and for the record, I have tried their steaks before and they are always sooo dry and taste blah.   This place makes me so mad."}
{"text":"This location just can't get orders right.  Another Applebee's will be our destination from now on."}
{"text":"Once aqain thiz location qets a biq 5 :) Me & my boyfriend dined in today for the millonth time and had a qreat experience . I believe our servers name was jaime . I might be wrong but point is she was great . For the first time we didnt like our food but thats not qoinq to stop us from qoinq . She was kind enough to remove it from our check since we hardly ate anythinq literally . We were willinq to pay for it but AppleBeez like always takes qud care of their customers . Thank you once aqain AppleBeez for havinq qreat service like ALWAYZ :)"}
{"text":"Worst applebees I've ever been too...I ordered the same thing I always do..the oriental chicken salad. The chicken was chewy and there was hardly and dressing or toppings. It was 11am and she brought me the dinner size without asking what is prefer...my grandfather had the quesadilla burger and said it was gross and he always likes to order that regularly. Kinda mad I wasted my gift card here..."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times while shopping at Carolina Mall in Pineville,nc. My last visit was with a new server named Angela. Angela was very sweet and accommodating, she was very attentive to our table and kept our drinks full. It is refreshing to see there is still  excellent customer service in this downtime of economy. Remember to tip our servers well when they do such a fine job that Angela did. With all that said I give 5 stars because of Angela's big smile and great service."}
{"text":"After waiting for ten minutes to get asked for drink orders,  our waitress was snobby and rude. We tried ordering queso and chips and we're told they don't have it anymore despite it being listed on the menu. So we were ignored for another twenty minutes and then ordered nachos, which came with the queso.  I tried to order a side and she said it was 3.50 for a tiny cup of it.  Think ketchup dipping cup. I expressed that that was pretty high for a small cup and she just gave me a disgusted look. Ugh,  whatever. It's been nearly a decade since I've been here and I decided to give it another chance. What a waste. The food isn't worth thee snooty, condescending service. Plus the nachos came and there was no visible cheese on them.  There's supposed to be two different kinds of cheese and there was almost none."}
{"text":"The servers are way to slow to handle hour.I dont know if it was just a busy day for them or if they are horrible all the time."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a good experience here. They either get my order wrong and/or the food is disgusting."}
{"text":"Service was average. Food was adequate - not bad but nothing extra special to rush back for. The best part was the chicken wings which were meaty and breaded and larger than we expected. Drinks were mixed well and beer cold. Lots of TV's in lounge so if eating wings, drinks and a game are the plan then try this place out. For the prices there are many similar choices that have flavors that are not so bland. We ate at this chain in States a couple of years ago and remember a better meal so a bit disappointed. It was OK."}
{"text":"We don't come here very often but this review is due to the second time in a row that our service has been aweful. We walked after 15 minutes of no drink order."}
{"text":"Used to enjoy eating here.  The waiting staff was always, and continues to be, friendly and in general top notch.  The cooking, however, has a lot to be desired.  A few times I have had clearly undercooked food delivered and had to have it re-made (and had to wait around for it too).  They were always really nice about it so I continued to visit.  Unfortunately that all changed when I fell ill for a whole day after eating lunch there.  I made a point to contact the management and notify them that something was wrong (cook, ingredients, something) and to make them aware that I might not be the only one.  I did not expect, nor did I ask for, any compensation for my trouble.  The manager did not care about it.  They did not take my number, name, time of order, nothing.  I tried to offer it to her, and she cut me off saying that it was not necessary and ended the call.  My wife and I did not visit for months following that incident.  The first, and last, time that we tried to give them another shot my wife's food was completely wrong.  Again the wait staff was very gracious about it all, but they lost a customer permanently after that visit."}
{"text":"The food here is flavorless  I been here 4 times order different plate on every visit and everything is tasteless even the hamburgers this is my last visit thanks Applebee's"}
{"text":"I came here last night for a late dinner and had the best service we have ever had by Jonathan S. We were greeted quickly and got our drinks and orders in quickly as well. The food was good! The only thing I was disappointed about was they changed the pretzel cheese dip recipe since the last time we came! It was SO good and was one of the reasons we would come here. They put something in it which made is spicy, it might have been peppers. The wings and entrees were good! We had a good time and I really appreciated the good and friendly service!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went tonight as a final dinner before our wedding tomorrow and we had Trent, this AMAZING server. Not only did he have a smile on his face but he was so nice and he was on top of his game. He went above and beyond. He is truly the best server we had ever had.   We will definitely be going back on a day he works."}
{"text":"Came here apples bees is ok the sweet potato mash potatoes didnt come with the pecans its showed in the picture. Ask for my steak to be well done but came with a little pink. Also mind you we all have our food but my son was still waiting for his food after 45 minutes. Will never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Restaurant was less than half full. Waiting at our table for at least 15 minutes and no one comes by to take a drink order. Tried even get someone's attention...nope. 4 servers standing around. We finally got to leave."}
{"text":"We had family in town and wanted to take them out to eat for a later dinner, expecting to beat the dinner rush. We got there at about 9:30, was told there was about a 15 minute wait...for what, I am not sure, but there were ALOT of tables that were dirty and many that were empty. When we finally got our table, it was sticky, so when the server came to greet us, I had asked her if she could bring a rag so WE could wipe it, I didn't ask her to, however she gave me a nasty attitude. When she came back about 10 minutes later to get our drink orders, we asked to put in our food since we have already been waiting for quite sometime. Our food took 45 minutes to come out, and I had to keep asking if it was almost done. At this point we were about ready to leave. Once the food came out,  mine was cold as well as other dishes my family had ordered. The manager did NOTHING about it, when I explained my concerns. A dinner that should have been no more than 1.5 hours turned out to be 3.5 hours. I will not be returning, and I advise whoever is reading this to stay far away from this location. It is not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"I have always felt that Applebee's food is mediocre. At times they have been less than mediocre but at least consistently mediocre. It'll do when you're hungry"}
{"text":"So I rarely order carside and when I do the presentation is awful the girl is rude. Just feels like they want to get you out at fast as possible... But today I ordered carside and and it was great. Tamarah was awesome! She was super friendly on the phone and in person, she made sure I had everything I needed and even double checked and showed me when she came to the car. Now what really surprised me was about a hour or so after I received my order she called back to check and see how my meal was and asked if their was anything she could do or the restaraunt could do to make it better for next time and that shocked me. Not another restaurant or carside has ever done that or asked me. She should either be helping train these other carside girls or at least give them some good pointers. Also tamarah mentioned she was a server so next time I dine in, I will be asking for her. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been to Applebee's a lot but this was my first time combing to this location. As always food is great  but I wasn't pleased with the service and it they took a while to bring the food to the table which I found surprising since the day we went it wasn't even busy"}
{"text":"This is the second time that we've gone to this particular location. I truly enjoy the unlimited soup & salad option and while at other locations featuring this lunch, I have to wait 4ever for my next choice; it wasn't the case here. Our server was great! Speedy ( she forgot to set the 14 minute or its free timer), but our meals ( there were 4 of us) arrived way before the fourteen minutes.  She kept our H2O glasses full, which I appreciate. The noisy family down the way with children was a bit distracting at times, but they do have to eat! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food.  Typical chain."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 and went there @ 9:30pm where we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait which we were ok with. After about an hour and asking to sat at tables in the bar area and being told we had kids and could not be sat there the manager finally came and sat us in 2 booths that were in the bar area that sat open the hole time we waited. Then it took a waitress 10 min. to come and take the drink order. 30 min. Still no drinks. Order apps at the same time. After all said and done we got the wrong apps and didn't get our dinner till almost midnight. Food was cold. My brother was called an asshole by the bartender. I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's in the same strip mall as the Fry's I am now going to and also Ace Hardware, Anna's Linens and a few other places I buy stuff at when needed. I go on Saturday mornings at 11 when it opens - which is in half an hour from now, lol - there is a bartender named Monica in there, she is the bomb. She makes GREAT margaritas and I have no problem at all with the food there.  I try something different every time and I haven't been disappointed yet.  The service is good and the wait staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"We had not been to Applebees in a while.  Service was good but the food had a few issues.  The fries were cold and the roasted potatoes were like cardboard.  That said, the proteins were fine.  That included chicken, shrimp and fish.  My guess is that those sides were made in bulk and since the restaurant was only 25 pct full, they got cold.  Entrees should have more vegetable options."}
{"text":"Typical Applebee's, nothing special. The service is pretty good; it has drastically improved over the last year. Happy Hour specials (1/2 off appetizers & drinks) seem to be a bargain. Perfect place if you're looking for something fairly cheap in Laveen and don't want to make dinner at home."}
{"text":"Only been to Applebee's a few times but never this location. Applebee's is always good if it's late and your in a pinch to find a place. My friends and I tried this Applebee's last night. (We usually go to the one on 7th st.) When we first walked in it was kind of a weird feeling. When we sat down my friends and I were making comments on how the staff looks like they hate each other and how it made an awkward work environment. We are all server so we understand a bad night but seriously it was really uncomfortable in the place. All the servers and host giving each other dirty looks. The food took a while to come out which I get sometimes the kitchen is slow. New cook, under staffed whatever not to big of a deal the issue was our server. I don't know if she had a bad case of resting B**** Face or what but she just seemed like she was annoyed with our existence. This is when it really gets bad about half way through eating my burger I got stabbed in the mouth by something sharp when I pulled it out it was a bone! Now I'm not the one to complain about my food and it was really good up till the end so I just ate the fries and was just done with the burger. ( I was to grossed out to finsh.)  I wish I would have said something. I have spend my whole day off from work sick as ever. I got food poisoning. I will never eat here again. I'm just so sick and annoyed I spent money to just get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Had an early day from work and took my son on a lunch/movie date. The staff was absolutely amazing, our server Jennifer was very attentive constantly checking In on us and making sure we had everything we needed. It was such a pleasure"}
{"text":"Came in on a slow Wednesday night, I feel like my server didn't really care too much about serving me. I was friendly dressed professionally & was with my children. She didn't give me my options of sides or any other popular dishes. No friendliness just blah. The food was great and I would have tipped more if she acted like she wanted to be there."}
{"text":"Best Applebee's I've  been to.  Bartenders are friendly and attentive.  Food is always good and well prepared.  Been to other locations that were questionable but the people at this one are top notch.  I miss the potato twisters but the \"new\" chips are super crispy.  Love the specials.  Onion soup... Napa chicken... burgers... steaks.. mmmmmm"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for apps and drinks a few nights ago. Ordered the three for 12.50, and then added two more for $3.00 each. The bartender was cool, very attentive. One of the apps we ordered was the meatballs. They were ok but tasted like they had more bread in them than meat. The bread that came with had a spot of mold on it. We ate the meatballs and showed the bread to the bartender. She took it to the kitchen to get a better look at it and showed it to the manager. The manager came to us at the bar and apologized and offered us another order of meatballs which we declined. I thought it would be a more appropriate response to offer to remove the price of one appetizer from the bill........maybe I'm wrong. We're only talking about three dollars here, but we will not go back to this location, unless we're in the mood for moldy bread that is. Hey kitchen staff, how about some quality control???"}
{"text":"I ordered carside to go and arrived two minutes after they said it would be ready.  Sat there for almost fifteen minutes with no one acknowledging me before calling the store.  Dustin apologized, but still didn't come out for another ten minutes.  All and all the whole thing took about 40 minutes.  I had my one year old and four year old with me otherwise I would have gone in.  I probably could have gone inside, sat down, and ate in the amount of time it took.  Got home and my daughter's apple slices and yogurt were all mixed together so she wouldn't touch them.  Very disappointing.  I only stopped there for the convenience (I've always thought the food was overpriced and hit or miss).  Don't bother if you're looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Got a snack with my husband here to hang out someplace pleasant but remembered why we don't like Applebee's. Nice environment but the food is awful. Got the onion rings and spinach dip with chips. Dip was good but the chips were old and the oil had gone rancid. Really? Get some fresh chips people!   The onion rings were factory made, frozen and cooked. They were all fried batter and cardboardy. The barbecue dip tasted like pancake syrup with coloring, garlic and smoky flavoring. We asked for Ranch dip and it tasted like something out of a packet from McDonalds. Nope. If you want real food don't go here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my friends. The service was horrible.  Waited for our drink orders to be taken. Food was ok. A big pqrty came in and our server just basically left us.  I even asked him 4 times to refill my drink he kept saying i am getting to it. Never got my drink refilled or the desserts we were planning on ordering. Left there very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in for drinks with my husband and had a good time. Staff was very nice and everyone had a positive attitude, I only had desert which was great. I'll up it to 5 next time I come for some food"}
{"text":"Excellent value with a lot to choose from.   A young lady named Hannah rocked out the service to really upgrade the experience.    Set up is nice where you can pay your bill automatically without having to wait which is a real cool thing when you're in a hurry.      Hannah was really awesome though which brought the rating to 5 stars..   Nothing like fantastic service.   The drinks came out fast and the food came out shortly after..   Bravo Applebee's..  Bravo Hannah..."}
{"text":"Usually, the service and food aren't too bad, but dinner last night made me change my mind.  When we walked through the door, we were greeted by the crowd of customers waiting for tables. Looked in the seating area and noticed it was only a little over half full. I guess it's too much work to wipe off a table and put a new place setting there.  Instead of cleaning the regular tables, the hostess led our party to the raised table surrounded by the uncomfortable bar stools. I guess she didn't notice the 85 year old woman with us (my mother visiting for the holidays). When we said we didn't want to eat our meal on bar stools, the hostess responded in a very snooty voice \"Well, then you'll have to go back to the waiting area while we clean one of these tables off just for you\".  It takes several minutes for them to get their rears in gear and actually clean tables like they're supposed to do. We sit down, and my mother asks the hostess if they accept the senior discount card, and she says (in her usually snooty voice) \"I don't know anything about that, I've only been here for two weeks, and this is my last day\". Well, at least we now know where the bad attitude is coming from.  The food wasn't bad, and our waiter, Nathan, did a fantastic job from start to finish. The whole experience was degraded by that bitchy hostess. I'm glad Applebees got rid of her."}
{"text":"Not Impressed! Walked in and the hostess said he was getting a table ready a second couple walked in and were sat by a separate person before us. Then we were sat next to the bar (that's fine) but we sat and sat and sat no one greeted us or asked us for drinks... Good thing we could place our own order (we were only in for dessert), the server finally came over and took our drink order almost 15 min later. When our desserts came my Blonde was barely warm and the usual sizzling plate wasn't even warm."}
{"text":"My family and I came in around 9:30 pm. It was very slow so there was no reason for our waitress to have been so unattentive. It was happy hour and I asked for a margarita which was $3. She said that they were $3.50 and I agreed. When we got the bill we were charged $4. I asked her about the price and she basically said \"Oh I had the price wrong, my bad\". No offer to fix or adjust the price, just oh well! Horrible customer service!   Also the back of the drink menu says that if your waitress doesn't mention a \"perfect margarita\" to you, you get a free s'more alcoholic beverage. I asked a different waitress about it and she said she was going to ask my waitress about it and neither one came back to me and offered my free drink. Smh!  I gave 2 stars because the food was good."}
{"text":"So far I've been here twice. I had two pretty good meals. The interior is a little fancier than the Applebee's in America. The wait staff dress better as well. They are friendly and happy to accommodate when I wanted to substitute due to dietary needs."}
{"text":"I like the Applebee's at this location, their food is good and the services can be a hit or miss. It depends on who is serving you. The con is their appetizers, I don't care much for the choices they give you.  I think if they would have better choices for their appetizers I would go more often."}
{"text":"I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.  The menu is, of course, classic Applebee's, something for everyone.  But I found the service to be listless.  When I entered the restaurant the last time, the two hostesses were sitting down; they lifted their eyes to see me, and then reluctantly brought their bodies upright.  One of them greeted me without a smile, and slowly showed me to my seat.  The waiter who took my order only said about two words, and I was supposed to guess what my role was at that moment in the non-conversation.  Zombies have taken over this restaurant.  It's more \"Shaun of the Dead\" than \"My Dinner with Andre.\""}
{"text":"Never going here again!! Me and my mom decided to go out to lunch and we chose Applebee's because we have been going here for yearrrrrs. When we got there we waited 15 minutes and no one came to seat us. The employees were standing around and looking at us like we were doing something wrong. I'm surprised they were like that because we have always went here, but now we are going to find somewhere else to go. My friends have also experienced the same thing. There were also times when we waited for forever to get our takeout meal (you can order online and pick it up from the restaurant) and it was completely wrong!"}
{"text":"The pasta at Applebee's are definitely not worth the $12 they charge. The portions are way too small and not good at all. Probably won't be visiting another apples bees again"}
{"text":"Terrible service, jerk of a bar tender, he was disrespectful to the hostess in front of customers. We got served water and 25 minutes later asked what we wanted to eat. Do not go to this location"}
{"text":"Applebees is great if you want a snack or decent lunch. That's no prime rib or such sip don't mistake out as a steak house.it's had great food for the price so be appreciative... ask for Narz, Nadine,Dominik, Amanda, Charles and Omar all veterans of the service. They are professionals."}
{"text":"Great service.. servers are awsome..Cassie, is cool...and friendly. The Thai shrimp salad was off the hook.. Coffee maaaan fresh brewed baby.. well it tasted great.. be back guys thanks.."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner after a day of sitting in bleachers at a TKD tourney, and I will say dinner was good. For a chain, the food was prepared as ordered, the server 'Lizzie' (a recent Pitt grad) was friendly and the price was appropriate. At our table steak was king. Both of my kid carnivores had 4oz steaks and baked potatoes (at $5.49 each).The steaks were cooked to specifications, and came out tender w/o a lot of gumminess or fight for my sons. The potatoes were hot and steamy and their beverage of choice milk, frosty and refreshing. My wife and I rounded out the steakfest w/ 8oz servings, hers butterflied and cooked well well done, and my steak medium rare. My steak was cooked to the point that it needed very little work to ingest,  mushrooms and onions dressed the steak and if I must say, it was dressed to impress and needed very little A1 steak sauce.  My baked potatoes was moist YET flaky disappeared rather quickly. Our waitress was intuitive and kept a steady 'stream' of drinks flowing. All in all the main course was okay. No complaints. We rounded dinner off w/dessert and my triple chocolate meltdown left ALOT to be desired. The cake portion was chalkie tasting and the fudge center cold at worst, room temp at best. Will I eat there again sure. Will I have that. Same dessert. Never."}
{"text":"I would give this location zero stars if I could. I sat there for over 20 minutes as 5 servers helped the people around me, including folks who got sat after me and not once did any of them acknowledge my presence. It was not busy at all. I ended up walking out. I won't ever return here due to the terrible service."}
{"text":"Ordered carside to go and waited over 20 minutes past the time my food was supposed to be ready. A car pulled up next to me and got their food immediately. No apology or even the slightest acknowledgement that I had been waiting for so long. I had already put the tip on my card so I couldn't change it...Last time I'll try this!"}
{"text":"My wife and I Ordered 2 things off the low fare menu, the Salmon and the Chicken.  It was EXCELLENT.   Full of flavor.  If I didn't know it was off the low cal menu I wouldn't have guessed it.  I picked it up from the curbside to go.  It was out to my car and I was ready to go within 2 mins. Great food.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Well, i would give this hole no stars. I am trying to figure out why they would have an item on the menu if the don't know how to cook it. I mean seriously, how can you screw up fish and chips. Oil was running off the batter, so I peeled off the batter only to find wet uncooked fish. It was gross! Thankfully i didn't have to pay for it. Will never return to another Applebee's again!"}
{"text":"Every time I came to this place, I always had to wait for a long time to get service. After that I had to wait another whole hour to get food.  One of the waitress there was not very smart! She actually placed a hot iron plate in front of my little baby! Hello!? Baby sees baby grabs! I was trying to tell her not to and push the plate out not of course I was not fast enough. So he got 2nd degree burn. I will NEVER come back again! Bad service and stupid servers."}
{"text":"I am in Love with the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad, get it in the bottomless salad combo and save a few bucks rather than buying the salad by itself and there is unlimited refills  service is average but as long as they have the salad I'll keep going!"}
{"text":"As Las Vegas residents we have seen and done just about everything and then some! This is one place we keep going back to time and time again.   Each time we visit we find the place to be clean, comfortable and teeming with friendly, capable staff. From the moment we walk in to the moment we walk out of the door, the staff seem to go above and beyond.   We have two small children, so patience is definitely appreciated! The food always comes out delicious and within a reasonable amount of time.   I realize that people (on here especially, sheesh!) tend to knock on the food, calling it precooked and reheated etc. What you have to keep in mind is that people need to consider Applebees fast food with a bigger selection and nicer seating area. Its a bit more expensive than most chain fast food stores, but that's because you DO get better food, more/better service and we have yet to leave dissatisfied!  If you want fine, fresh dining then you probably don't want to go to a place like Chilis or Applebees. These exist for the purposes of a laid-back family friendly version of \"sit-down dining\". Instead, if you feel like you're not getting Michelin star quality cuisine, go to one of the casino restaurants, or a place on the strip and blow all your money there... But for a family of four on a budget who want tasty food, a nice atmosphere and a welcoming environment, we will ALWAYS return to Applebees!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all. It took very long to be prepared and when it finally arrived the food was not hot. The chicken in the \"Fiesta Lime Chicken\" as well as the Kids Grilled Chicken was over cooked (dry and rubbery) My daughter ordered the \"Chicken Parmesan\" and the sauce did not taste good at all.  My wife had ordered a Martini and the glass was not clean and sticky all over the stem. She had to us a tissue to hold the glass. When we received the bill we were surprised to see that the coke had been charged separately though it should have been part of the kids meal. We had to point it out to the server and have it corrected. I usually judge the quality of a restaurant by the cleanliness of the washrooms and they fell short in this department as well."}
{"text":"The best servers and bartenders in town!! They are always friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. We go at least once a week. Every time we are there we have fun and love the food."}
{"text":"we went on new years eve. The waitress was very nice, but the food was horrible! there was a big plastic strip in one of the salads, the steak was very small and not that good, the shrimp tasted undercooked. On the bright side our drinks always stayed full."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for someone to even come and greet us and take our drink order.  Never a good experience here"}
{"text":"We like it here.  The two of us went in today for lunch and there was a short wait (15 minutes) so we decided to grab our drinks at the bar while we waited.  The Bartender was visually a bit flustered as there were three unsavory looking and sounding women seemingly trying his patience with their drinks and menu ordering.  When her got to use I ordered a Cadillac Margarita on the Rocks in the Big glass and he got a tall Spotted Cow on tap.  I continued to be friendly to the Bartender as I know the type and he was tipped $3 for the drinks.  While we got down off our bar stools he did say 'thank you, enjoy your meals.'  Our waitress was Tasha and she was very pleasant; we ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and chatted in between watching basketball and Men's gymnastics on one of their many TV's.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the works (hold the cheese) and he ordered two (2) trios; one for now and one for later.  The food was good, but the fries were sparse and non-crispy while they were seasoned OK.  He had another Spotted Cow and we cashed out.  All in all another nice afternoon at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Just like other Applebees.  You always know what to expect!  The waitress was friendly to me and the BF.  We got our food on time and the meal was good.  Wish they would add a little more to the menu to make it more than just a quick consistent meal.  But overall they know how to take care of their customers.  I gave it three stars because I do think they can improve."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food was lacking. I ordered the Fiesta chicken roll up. There where two small (1inch) pieces of chicken in each half. It was stuffed with lettuce and a ton of cheese. Looked nothing like the menu picture. I've been to this Applebee's twice in a year or more and the food is always poor."}
{"text":"Called to place a order waited 5 minutes just for her to put me on hold again 5 minutes passed and she hung up called back put me on hold horrible service thanks jasmine"}
{"text":"Wife and I sometimes eat here before going to the movies near by. It's never been as bad as the restaurants in Champaign, always a solid effort, but last time with a new menu it was outstanding. I had a pork chop with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans and my wife had a whisky chicken dish. Both of us were very impressed. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deals - but the happy hour specials are DEF the best!"}
{"text":"My experiences with Applebees have usually been positive or okay. Our visit did not begin well. Our host, a young and effeminate black man, passed us over for a party of young, white and single men. After he seated them, he sat us, two Hispanic women. I guess the host has extracurricular interests in mind rather than doing his job right.   Our server, Hispanic as well, was not particularly helpful when it came to my dietary specifications. She acted like the restaurant was doing people like me some kind of favor by being accommodating. The server dedicated more time and service to white customers who were already leaving than us. She wasted our time because the server made us wait several minutes before she came back and took our order. After the iced tea that we ordered finally arrived, we checked out.   This brings me to address a serious problem in customer services that some minorities perpetuate against ourselves: treating white customers better than ourselves. Whether this is consciously done or not, it is unacceptable and must stop. One cannot presume that nonwhites are going to leave a bad tip compared to whites because some of us see ourselves as \"perpetually poor\" and less worthy.   When we paid our bill at the front, the host acted flippant and bewildered as to why we left the restaurant. We did not bother to elaborate our reasons because the Applebees staff would be too clueless to get it. Also, The waitress continued with the \"we're doing you a favor attitude\" just because she shaved us $0.40 from our bill, which was the tax. Wow. I'm supposed to feel grateful."}
{"text":"They made my elderly, mobility challenged mother cry!  Non existent service.  Not welcoming at all.  Upon entering the restaurant on Christmas Eve, instead of being greeted, the hostess barked that they were closing soon. and we would need to hurry up \"just so you know.\"  When I asked when they closed, I was told in one hour.  Really?!?  One hour and you're turning guests away, especially a party with an elderly couple on Christmas Eve!  SHAME!!!!!!  They wouldn't accommodate a basic seating preference for my elderly mother who had trouble walking.  They made her walk to the farthest side of the restaurant!!  Despite that we sat where ordered.  Then we were completely ignored.  Nobody acknowledged us at all.  Servers walked buy several times.  They wouldn't look at us or even take our drink order.  Thank you for ruining a Christmas Eve for my elderly parents.   For hours my mother was talking to family and friends about the experience and was in tears during each conversation saying that she was in complete disbelief that she would be treated so rudely, especially on Christmas Eve.  I sent two letters to their corporate office and never received even a form letter response."}
{"text":"Horrible service Food was disgusting. I ordered a cheeseburger I get to the last bite and realize that there was bacon on my burger. There was not enough people on the floor to help the server out."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was horrible.  The table was not cleaned when we were seated. A girl came to clean the table with a smelly dirty rag and brushed all the crumbs on our laps. I asked if she would please get a clean cloth. When she came back she argued with me...told me the last one was clean. If a cloth smells enough for me to notice then it's full of bacteria and not at all clean. No wifi either. Why? The waitress said it's because people stay too long. I will not be visiting any Applebee's again."}
{"text":"I love Applebee's! I've only been to this location but they're always friendly and patient with us. Karaoke nights are also really fun! The food is always nice and warm, never had a problem with it. I always order the three cheese chicken penne which is delicious! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Don't bother, awful service with no compensation. Food tasted like it was microwaved. Will not go back to that applebees, I'll like West Mifflen applebees though."}
{"text":"Valerie was an awesome server!!!!  My husband and I went for a date night...we got the 2 for $24... Mozzarella sticks, chicken finger platter and 9 oz sirloin...  The appetizer was yummy, my chicken fingers were so over cooked I could not eat them and my husbands 9 oz steak was half that (maybe).  However Valerie gave us a discount for the bad chicken fingers...even offered a replacement and she was so friendly throughout our dinner.  I ordered a vodka and RedBull which wasn't mixed very well and my husband had a long island which he \"didn't like\" (no further input). We ended up just getting a Pepsi.  Overall the experience was great even if the food sucked."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 2 stars because when walking in at around 930 pm we were greeted by a rude hostess that was not pleasant at all. We had had a long trip from San Diego to Las Vegas and was not expecting such an attitude . All her and the other hostess did was gossip loud near the front entrance.  Then while eating we noticed a women walking up to cars , provably asking for money. I think the only pleasant person that we came in contact was was actually the waiter. HE was a great server and and gave great service, I wish I would have gotten his name. I would probably go again just for convenience but would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Anthony, our waiter was excellent! His attention and concern to making sure we received the best possible experience and food is unheard of in a typical chain restaurant.  Thanks again !"}
{"text":"If you go to this location ask for Michael as your server... He wasn't my server... if I ever go back I would ask for him. The manager there was wonderful... Went above and beyond"}
{"text":"Something has changed drastically for the worse at this location. I have been going to this Applebee's for close to a decade now and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. For starters the restaurant was much emptier than usual (perhaps that could have been a warning sign). Once we arrived we requested two booster seats for our children from the host, who immediately forgot about them as soon as we were shown to our table. Our drink orders were eventually taken, but didn't arrive until long after our appetizer did. The appetizer arrived with no plates or silverware. We had to \"flag\" down a server to ask for utensils and the status of our drinks. We were told the bartender hadn't prepared for the evening yet and had to \"set up her bar stand\".  Once my margarita arrived it tasted awful. The kids meals arrived long before our entrees and the kids cheeseburger looked and tasted horrible. Eventually we were given our check to sign with no pen and had to flag down the server yet again to ask for one. Meanwhile, the restaurant is no longer a family friendly place, the clientele there has shifted to customers spewing unnecessary vulgarities left and right. It's a shame really."}
{"text":"Comfortable and familiar doesn't have to mean ordinary.  Applebee's has become a U.S. restaurant staple: serving up classic yet inventive American fare. A stop into this 'neighborhood' grill and bar finds one in an informal, comfortably-lit atmosphere -- enough TVs to keep up with the game, but not so many that it looks like the Best Buy sales floor.  We stopped into this location for some of what most folks have likely come to expect from Applebee's: a slightly above-average quality, down-to-earth meal at a reasonable price. To my amazement, not only was I served one of the best meals in months, but the service rivaled that of four-star steakhouses.  Things started pretty average. We got drinks, ordered food, waited for said food, etc. Upon the food' arrival, I found that my one of my Applebee's favorites -- the Bourbon St. steak -- was very much undercooked and coated in a sauce very foreign to me (and the menu).  Not ten seconds after Grant, our server, saw this did he insist on the kitchen remaking it, rather than simply bringing it up to my desired temperature. Both he and Matt, an attentive and polite manager, offered me complimentary soup, salad, or something else to snack on (though I politely declined, as I knew the size of the meal in my immediate future).  My replacement Bourbon St. sirloin arrived sooner than expected, cooked precisely to order. A steaming, well-seasoned 9oz sirloin served sizzling on a skillet with saut√©ed onions and mushrooms. In place of the standard redskins, I substituted the garlic mashed potatoes -- a steaming hot and irrefutably fresh choice.  Again -- this was probably the best meal *and service* I've had in months. Not only have I paid much more for far worse food, I've endured mediocre service in the process. While not all meals can be perfect all the time, I'm glad I gave this place the opportunity to correct it.  Bottom line: while I'm not terribly fond of chains, they can still surprise you once in a while, reinforcing the fact that I shouldn't necessarily hold their incorporated status against them."}
{"text":"I come here a lot with my family! And my kids love coming here! They are usually really busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so the wait to be seated is usually longer than usual. But it's not too bad if you come during the week. The food is great!  I usually have a pasta or a streak meal. And you can't go wrong with the 2 for $20 special. There is also karaoke on some nights which is pretty entertaining to watch and listen to during your meal."}
{"text":"Just off the 215 and Warm Springs, Applebee's is always a welcome sight. The menu has been updated. Choose 2 entrees for $20 has been added, or my favorite, choose 2 of the following: soup / salad / sandwich. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Some large restaurant chains such as these are over-priced and over-hyped in my opinion. So when I went to Applebee's, I did not expect much compared to the service and food you would get at a family-owned establishment. However, I was quite wrong - the service there was amazing the first time I went. And the second. Amazing in that, with a party of about 15, the waitress was patient enough to treat everyone (including refilling my water, which I down quite rapidly). Also amazing in that, with the unlimited fish & chips, she gave me as many as I asked for (and offered my girlfriend some too). I was scared of the service with the 'unlimited' food portions, but I suppose it was for no reason.  One point off for the quality of their fish and chips, however. I didn't expect too much quality from their fish and chips, but the breading was a bit too heavy. It was alright though."}
{"text":"Food look like it was jst tossed on plate and plate looked like a kids meal.not to mention i waited an hour for an appetizer tht ddnt even come with plates.horrible service"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly, seen by our waiter quickly, even visited by management. So, why don't they serve Thousand Island dressing????"}
{"text":"Cedar Lemon chicken so disappointed by the look of it you can tell how dry those chicken was it used to have some sauce in it the rice and quinoa are not bad, it has been my favorite and Im Certain what it taste like unfortunately that day wasn't what i was hoping for."}
{"text":"We've eaten here with friends several times over the past couple years.  I like their 4 cheese Mac & cheese with chicken strips.  Last night I ordered the same and found that the serving had shrunk in size by about half.  When I brought it to our servers attention, her reply was that it's always served in this bowl.  Well, yes it is...it's just not usually so little amount in the bowl.  I asked her if my dinner looked like $12.00 worth of Mac& cheese (and 3 chicken fingers).  She got the manager who 'supposed' he could get the kitchen to make some more.  I told them not to worry about it.  I don't want to sound cheap... I don't mind spending a little on my dinner... I'm just used to getting enough to take home for a lunch at work.  Not last night.  I won't be going back to this applebees. . Kinda felt like they didn't care weather I returned or not... So I wont"}
{"text":"I have been to this Applebee's many times before but this is for sure my last time! I have never been treated so badly. The bartender we had to ask for a drink and the manager to order... The bartender walked past us about 30 times not one time looking at us to see if we wanted anything else to order or drinks it was the worst Jessica is terrible don't go to this Applebee's they have terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Horrible place to go, waited for seats and when we did get seated, we waited. No one took our drink orders, we had to ask for our waiter and she just walked right past us. I seen enough waiters to help but I seen one person working and it look like the manager. Poor Service, last time I'll ever go there"}
{"text":"uggh I loath Applebees! It's like the Wal-Mart of restaurants. So corporate, cheesy, and generic. And it's not even cheap! People: Don't go to places like this, local mom and pop resturants are soo much better"}
{"text":"watch what your ordering they know who to say the food is included in your dinner but is not and cost you more do not touch the game on your table even if you don't run a credit card they charge you 1.99 there drinks are elusive on there times the waiters don't know and charge you the most ask a lot of questions"}
{"text":"The other night we went in 15 minutes before closing. We had just flown in from Arizona and Applebee's was one of the few places still open. They reassured us that it was alright for us to come in so close to closing time. Manager and server were very nice. Great service overall."}
{"text":"Folks, let's be fair when we are reviewing Applebee's. Some people act like they have high expectations while being oblivious to the fact that this is a no frills cafe. I had not been to an Applebee's in 15 years and it may be another decade before I try it again. Food is just okay. Service is fine. Atmosphere is like a Denny's. It is as expected."}
{"text":"Shiity service, waitress needs to smile more. Food was great. It was pretty full for a Tuesday night. Kind of loud with people trying to over talk the music."}
{"text":"Allan was an excellent barserver! Funny, knowledgeable,and friendly, he definitely made it a great visit. Our lunches came out hot and as expected. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today around 430pm. No hostess. Waited 15 minutes to be seated. Waited another 15 minutes and no waiter or waitress. We just got up and left. Horrible service. Won't be returning. Waisted 30 minutes of my lunch and didn't get a thing to eat."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was not very good.  Ordered the chili lime chicken something. It was not spicy, I did not notice any lime but lots of cilantro. The chicken was fine. I was told that it was a lunch sized portion, I was there for dinner, fine with me, no prob.   Basically a chicken rice and vegetable dish. Sadly the vegetable was broccoli - ugh. Not much else. Rice....,I could have counted the grains. This is apparently some calorie reduced dish, hence the smaller portion size. So why the 4 pounds of broccoli? I can't imagine ever wanting to eat that much broc - ever.   Desert, not worth mentioning. Came not as described on the menu, close but not."}
{"text":"Honestly! !  This place sucks!! The food is Not fresh at all. It's all frozen and reheated. My husband ordered ribs and they were burnt and dry. You can tell they were old,  cooked a day or two before and reheated. My salad was 90% dressing and what tasted to be imitation bacon. I returned my mango rita, it was all sour mango!! We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"flew in to town Thursday went here because it's close to the airport. Only thing that we ate that day was food from here don't get me wrong the food was amazing ordered the 2 for 20 ribs and bourbon chicken and shrimp and cheese stick appetizer but we both caught a stomach virus afterwards."}
{"text":"Got seated at around 9. Knew what we wanted and placed our order right away. The people in front of our booth and behind our booth left and more people came. We got our appetizer and first round of drinks in a timely manner. Around 930, the people that were behind us that came 15 minutes after us received their food. Thought that was weird. But then at 945 the people in front of us got their food so at that point we were annoyed. The waitress must've been able to tell because she grabbed our empty glasses off the table and said \"I'll be right back it's because they got appetizers that's why\". 5-10 minutes later the manager (I'm assuming) brought out our food. While she was sincerely apologetic, she did little to compensate for the inconvenience. She told us she would comp us a free dessert. The only issue was we never saw her again after that and never got our free dessert. Anyways, so we finally got our food. Well we only had one set of silverware so we had to wait for the waitress to come back. Mind you our empty glasses that she took off the table 15 minutes ago haven't been replaced nor has she asked us if we even needed anything else. In fact, we didn't see her again until we were done, at which point all she said was, \"anything else?\". I've been to this location numerous times and have always had pleasant experiences. This was honestly the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant. I would have been a little more understanding if she would have accepted blame or apologized at all to us. She's lucky she received even a small tip."}
{"text":"Carside to go is a great way of getting dine-In food with out dinning-in. It's fast and efficient. The Cajun shrimp from Applebee's however is not something I would recommend."}
{"text":"This is not going to be a good review. Our visit was horrible. we thought that we wasn't going to be waited on after about 15 minutes from being seated. Finally our waitress arrived with this nonchalant attitude. If it hadn't been the fact that we were tired and hungry, and would have eaten our shoes at this point, we would have gotten up and left. We ordered the under 550 calorie Sizzling Chili Lime Chicken. The chicken on top was cold and some of the vegi's were burnt. The plate was a mess. I will upload a picture for all to see. The only taste that could be detected was the sauce that they poured all over it which I bet made it more than the 550 calories that was claimed. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"\"Open till 12am or later\"  Just don't show up at 11:30pm to grab only desert. We came in at and waited about 5-8 minutes for someone to grab and seat us. The manager saw us. Went to the back. Saw us again, then came finally came out.   When he came to sit us I asked them what time they were closing, the managers response was \"in about few minutes.\" So we left."}
{"text":"I had the Blackened Tilapia, it was lightly rubbed in Cajun spices, grilled and drizzled with garlic and thyme sauce. Served with fried red potatoes and seasonal vegetables, a cold draft.   And of course I had to have a Cheesecake shot for desert"}
{"text":"Quick and easy take out with friendly service. The food is the same as other Applebee's, this location was just more convenient than driving further downtown."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was terrible. When we finished our meal, we asked the waitress for desert and she walked off and came with the bill. We also asked for a container for our food and she took our leftovers and threw them in the trash. The lady would not even make eye contact with us. I will definitely not be returning to this location. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I had a gift card to Applebee's so I went for lunch.  Except for being incredibly calorie laden the food was good and prepared in a timely manner.   Service staff was nice and took good care of me.  Given the choice I would chose something else but free food is never bad."}
{"text":"Never going to this location again! Horrible experience! My sister and I got completely burnt chicken strip and when they remade them it took over 45 minutes! Our server told us he informed the manager and that gave us the oh so generous 10% off our meal. I was so mad I complained on their survey, an hour later I get a call with an apology, i was told the manager was never really told and the server just gave us the military discount to save his our butt, and a $25 giftcard. Not even that was enough to ever make me come back the the Craig location. If I could give it half a star I would!"}
{"text":"The server Steph was awesome and I'd come back! The perfect pomegranate margarita is great and so is the friendly service and good food!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but I don't like going to that place anymore. Every single time i've been there, something is always wrong with my orders. Either they forget a certain or they just give the wrong food. Last time I was there, I ordered the Hawaiian burger that they have.. but they gave me a burger that had nothing but mushrooms on it. And the waiter STILL had the audacity to try to convince me and keep the mushroom burger. I kept on insisting on the original burger I ordered, it was a huge hassle. The service there is just terrible."}
{"text":"First things first.... They did not allow me to use my military discount. Because I don't look like the \"military type\". Even though I have my military id to prove it. The GM started asking me a billion questions. I just got fed up with it and told him at this point I don't care about the discount. 2nd thing. The rice they gave me for my fiesta line chicken was soooooooo dry it made Mohave desert seem like a resort. Yes, they did replace it with fries. But not until I asked 3 or 4 times. Horrible service. F*** their unpatriotic manager. Never going back and I wouldn't recommended anybody who's in the military that doesn't look like the \"military type\" to go either.  Rant over."}
{"text":"Been a long time since ate here but I went last night .... wow I was surprised. Great food and Ashley the bartender was awesome . Very reasonable and tasty ....sooo give the Apple a try !!"}
{"text":"Visited today with my whole family. We Waited for a while no server came in. I asked for  the manager to come to our table but he didn't show up. Server \"Ray\" stepped in to help us. We were ready to walk out. Thanks Ray"}
{"text":"If i had the option to rate it at zero I will . The worst service ever and the food was horrible also . Despite all this my wife even found a bug in the salad. It took 50 minutes to get our food . I will never go back"}
{"text":"Everybody that works at Applebee's  friendly I like family the food is great I will go back"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible meal. Our meal took over 30 min. to come. Our sandwiches were very dry like they used stale bread. The place was almost empty.  Love Applebee's but not going back to this one on Baseline & Gilbert Rd."}
{"text":"I want to thank the manager Asan Stannder for making my visit here so much better. My food was late and I didn't get my drinks till almost 20 minutes later and my hamburger was burnt. But he talk to us apologize and gave us a solution. That's how good managers should be and his one of them. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my sister after an 8 year hiatus.  Back to the hiatus.  There is a reason we have called this place \"Crapplebees\".  I was reminded of that tonight.    The shining star was the sweet potato fries, but c'mon, how hard is it to toss a handfull of fries in the fryer?  Everything else was obviously made from frozen.  Boil in bag type stuff.  Had spinach artichoke dip and macaroni and cheese.  Blech and meh.  That is my official description.  Service. Not great but nothing to be upset about. Again, meh.  I just dont know how this chain has lasted this long."}
{"text":"Extremely dissapointed. I've come this location on several occasions and for the most part it's always good. However our server Yiniva  U. needs some serious time management training. Seriously the food shouldn't take an hour to arrive. Instead our appetizers like 40 minutes to arrive ! Now I work in a restaurant and I understand delays can come arise but come on its not even busy for all this wait. She never once checked on us, I had to call her through the tablets aevery freaking time. Not only that but she had the nerve to ask us if we paid! If she would be on top of it she would of realized we paid long time before she even dropped the check. Overall don't recommend instead go to the salad bar inside Smiths. That's worth more than the unforgettable \"meal\". We didn't eat our dinners. Thanks."}
{"text":"An easy walk across the lot from the Courtyard where I was staying.  The  food was really good - chicken portobello entree.  The service was OK, not great but not terrible.  The atmosphere was really good for me as I was wanting something a little calmer than Texas Roadhouse which was total insanity when I was there last.  I will definitely return when I am in town again.  The reviews I read previously are really harsh compared to my experience."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to be sat. Everything was okay at first. But once me and my friend finished our waters we noticed the waitress Lindsey walk past us multiple times and twice with a water pitcher? Where she could've stopped for less than a minute to at least ask us if we needed anything. When we got the food (steak) everything was cold and still she wasn't attentive at all. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant. The menu and food is OK. What do you expect for the price, right? I had the rib eye steak which was decently price. I ordered veggies and a baked potato as my sides. I did not know that the baked potato was an extra $4+, I was like wow! For a baked potato? It should have been included with my entree. The steak was surprisingly good and seasoned well, even though it was probably cheap meat. I think this place is either a hit or miss depending on your mood and what you like. It narrowly passed my grade book."}
{"text":"My visit to this Applebee's was not a pleasant experience. The servers were short and directly insulting. Do not order the 4 cheese macaroni with honey pepper. It is wayyyy too sweet, it tastes like they poured sugar packets into it. Also, the lemonade is very watery (not sure if the fountain needed to be changed or if it's Light). The appetizer, wonton tacos were good. My friend got bourbon street chicken something and it was dry and the onions were basically raw.   I would not recommend coming here for a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence here,  one horrible and one good aervice, I know it's not the Wynn but good service should be accessible at any restaurant. The place is very empty, and from my personal experience  that means bad service history."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff! I usually only sit at the bar so I can really comment on the bartenders, all rather attractive and friendly! Great happy hour specials, not only from 3 to 7 but 9 to 1am?!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate lunch here. My wife discovered there is a paper in her sandwich so we called a manager about it. The manager saw the paper (paper that used for separating the hams) and replaced her sandwich. Then surprisingly, he offered that everything is on the house.... we declined but he insisted so we decided to take care of the waitress... we are sure she was happy with the tip. Service and food are always Great here."}
{"text":"Lunch is fast and fresh and Kim @ the bar is the best...she must be, always filled with regular customers..."}
{"text":"Service was great and quick. Our drinks arrived quick and our server Melissa had honest and accurate suggestions.  She was really friendly and fun!  Only problem was that it was really cold because of the air conditioning.  Otherwise it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Burbon street stake was sizzling so hard when I got it that it popped me in the face with hot grease. It tasted great after waiting 5 minutes to feel safe to eat it. I orderd it medium rare. It was well done, not even pink in the middle. If that grease had left a mark on me, there would have been hell to pay. that's why you get one star. Though the waitress was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food, great experience! I have celiac disease and have to be very careful where and what I eat. The manager, Samantha, ( at 59th ave and Peoria )was very knowledgeable and had the kitchen staff do everything possible to make my meal gluten free."}
{"text":"My dinner was plentiful and good.  However, Oriental Orange chicken should have more sauce,at  least enough to cover each chunk of chicken.  The bed of \"oriental vegetables\" was mostly carrots, onions, red bell peppers, celery and mushrooms.  Two edamame didn't quite qualify as making it oriental.  As I said,  good tasting, but NOT oriental."}
{"text":"The manager was rude this step was rude the food came out and no where near what I ordered it it sucks all the way around one of the worst restaurant I've ever been to will never go back there again"}
{"text":"My daughter and I are enjoying a nice lunch today. Everyone is so nice and accommodating which is nice because I'm on a knee scooter with a broken foot. Our food was hot fresh and fast... so fast that the entree was a bit faster than one of the appetizers so the manager took it off the tab on their own! I call that Make It Right Service- and that is service I always return for!!! Thank you Sarah for a great lunch! :)"}
{"text":"Jerry and I went their on Veterans Day not knowing of the  specials for the day. Our beer was free and Jerry's dinner was free. The servers were very happy and wonderful. We had a great time. Love Applebee's !!!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal. I walked out wishing I went to Chili's."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Three brunette hostesses at front were shooting nasty glared at my grandmother and I. They were making snarky comments and decided to keep giving us nasty looks after we asked questions. When we politely changed our minds, we handed them the menu back and all three were staring at us after we walked out. Not very professional"}
{"text":"Ok, I've tried this place on multiple occasions and each time I had a beef with them - both litterally and figuratively.  #1  I had a Pesto Burger (which was from Tyler Florence's menu inspirations or something). It was on focaccia with fresh mozzarella, pesto, amd tomato bruschetta. It came with french fries seasoned with rosemary, parmesan and sea salt.     Gak. In theory this could be delicious but what actually came out was a greasy burger on a soggy bun with unripe tomato bruschetta and soggy fries. Bummer on a plate.  #2 Bacon Cheeseburger w/fries How hard is that, really? I mean, other than the fact that you can no longer get a burger cooked to just medium - does it really need to come out the texture of a hockey puck? To add insult to injury my french fries were actually french fry skin jackets with no potato inside, they were that well done. Don't EVER go here after 7.  #3 Cowboy Burger This evil thing had a BBQ Sauce on it that was so sickly sweet.. and the onion ring on the top was soggy. Just thinking about it makes me want to.... you get the picture?  I've had other things at ABee's over my lifetime. None of which make me think about going back, ever. So this time, I probably won't."}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE If you're a type 1 diabetic or need to see nutritional facts about what you're eating them don't expect to see any here. I'm type 1 diabetic, with that comes with having to know exactly how many carbs are in what I eat. I had a problem with a waiter here when I asked for the nutritional facts explaining I'm a diabetic. They straight up told me \"we don't have to show you that\" I asked for a manager and told me THE SAME THING!!! By law they need to give customers access to nutritional facts. Never coming here again.... it's already bad enough I have to deal with carb counting and on top of it having ignorant staff denying me access to something I have a right to."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:20 and were sat in less than a minute. Service was quick.  Food was equal to other Applebee's or better."}
{"text":"Let's start off first with when we walked in there was only two cars outside and six people eating on the inside. There was more than enough servers here and I was looked at by two of them while waiting at the door to be seated. It took three minutes after that for someone to finally come up and seat us. After that I was asked by two different ladies if I needed drinks and I applaud that. The only thing is that one lady was very friendly and the other was dressed like a stripper, shirt tied in the front, a bandana over her hair, a sparkle belt, and had her stomach hanging out. For a family joint this should be unacceptable, there should be a dress code and it should be enforced. While waiting on my food then there was two waitresses standing about 15 feet away and my date and I had to have heard the word \"shit\" a solid 5 or 6 times. Again if your staff wishes to talk like this then please keep it in the back. Also I noticed that the whole time that  we have been at the restaurant 8:05 pm till 9:20 pm there has been a very little crowd. I do not know why that is speaking that it is a Thursday night and I expect this place to be popping like all the others I have been too. To top this off again for being so dead it took our food 43 minutes to get to our table, my drink sat empty for 15 minutes along with my dates drink for 12 minutes. I have always love Applebee's but I will never come back to the Savoy Applebee's till I am assured that corrective measures are taken to solve problems I have had and what I have had others tell me."}
{"text":"Great food. beer not so cheap unless it's happy hour.   I arrived around 2:30PM Wednesday I ordered the  jalape√±os,BBQ cheese burger with fries. $9.50. the burger is about the size of a Carl's JR $6 burger. But this one taste much better. Freshly cooked juicy hot. the Waiter claims that the burger meat is fresh and never frozen. It took 10 to 15 minutes to receive my burger. That is good because i want a freshly cooked burger, not a microwaved burger. The fries are okay, no wow factor. The fries portion was small in my opinion. They should give just a little more fries and maybe a side like a celery stick.    Overall, i would return to this restaurant soon. Maybe during happy hour."}
{"text":"Truly horrible service!  The food wasn't much better either. My daughter ordered that new pulled pork bacon ham sandwich. Wow!  Talk about not looking like the picture. Sad looking ham, pur√©ed pork and just gross. Server asked how everything was - we told her terrible. She ignored us. So for her full price dinner my daughter are potato chips. What?  My rubles were overlooked and fries over seasoned. My mother in law had the fiesta chicken. The only fiesta was the greasy cheese that was completely costing the tiny piece of chicken. It was so disgusting looking.   And don't think you're going to get refills. Even while looking at empty glasses our server walked away. I stopped her to ask for refills after she started walking away.   And just in case our server reads this. The 2% tip wasn't a mistake. I was feeling generous."}
{"text":"Nice place for a date as long as you and your date created the ambience .its incredible, on the other hand the restrooms are disgusting and the service at the bar for ordering food was just very lame we didn't get any condiments the server didn't come back to take our order we waited and waited and actually my man here ,he said the service sucked and it's a Sandy I think working tonight we're not going to stick around for dessert or to see what else is going to be any good or bad because we had quite enough."}
{"text":"My two friends and I went for lunch today and the service was really bad. There were several tables loaded with dirty dishes around us, which, when we left an hour it so later, were still the same way. It took so long to get our food that I did not order a second portion for fear that we would have  to wait too long.  The food, when we finally got it, was tepid soup and a spinach salad without much dressing but trying to send it back was not an option. It looked as if they were short on staff and very short on supervision.   I will not be going back for some time. This experience was very frustrating."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since they were giving away a free sampler of their appetizers and have never been. Service started out ok. We had the 2 for $20 with the wings and hamburger and riblet basket. Food was decent but what was really bad was the decline in service. The only time we we checked upon was when the food was being delivered. After finishing we wanted a to go box and check. After waiting 10 minutes we used the touchscreen at the table to call for a waitress. After doing this twice, I had to physicAlly hunt down our waitress to get a box and check. Service was so bad that a couple caddy corner to our table were having similar issues that we ended up joking about together."}
{"text":"blah... it was just blaah... ugh - our server was tired and wasn't that attentative... she tried to apologize but she kinda just trailed off... lol. But I guess its okay, but THEN... there came in a white couple and all of a sudden our waitress sprang to life!!  Uhhh... okaaaay??  At first I thought, great now she'll be attentative... ummmm... no. no she wasn't. I know that the East side of town is racist... ugh, I don't wanna talk about the ASU Bookstore Incident... Good grief!!   This chick, I WISH I caught her name... was all smiles and giggles and then came to our table (which was only about 6 feet away) and was all frowns and excuses. It was sickening.  She failed to bring us our drinks, she only refiled them once and ignored us twice when we tried to ask for more water... okay the Iced Tea was too much for you... how impossible is water??   We had enough and were ready to walk out on the check when; I guessed she sensed our frustration and brought it to the table early! *harsh sigh*   We paid in cash and got about $8 in change... which she brought to us in all ones!! omg, is she for real?? lol, I just laughed when I saw it... and I chose to leave a yelp card instead of any cash!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give this place two stars, but seriously - I HAVE experienced better.   Growing up in Laveen, where there has never been anything but dairies and fields between my house and south Phoenix. To have four lane roads and stop lights is freakin' psycho to me!! Oh my gosh! Besides my Laveen novelty of the whole idea of having an actual resturant in our lil hick town... I do like Applebee's.  You can see me there - very late at night chilling with my friends talking about God knows what enjoying appetizers and refillable sodas. Their drinks aren't anything to write home about - seriously, chili's get it better. Their appetizers aren't as weird as Chili's so I'm glad. Their decor isn't great - come on... I say Applebee's you know what I mean.   But what this place DOES have going for it is it's waitstaff. They are always friendly, quick and occasionally funny. I like their staff but once in a while they have odd lil grabass competitions that I have personally shouted at them to stop. Once they didn't quit and I complained and scored a free meal! (whoo!)   I think it's a nice place, but honestly - it's just your average Applebee's but trust me, there are some Applebee's where the servers are jerks, Thank goodness - this place isn't like that!!  Hope to see you there! -Cher"}
{"text":"I remember when Applebees used to be nice. Then they stopped caring about appearance. I was here last week around noon for lunch  I wanted to turn around and leave because it looked so dirty. If the floors around the hostess desk are filthy I shudder to think what the kitchen is like. No matter what the food tastes like if you have to wonder if it's clean it pretty much ruins it. Have some pride Applebees"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Hostess said it would be a 45min wait when there was 2 booths, 2 hightops, and chairs open at the bar. They advertise 1.00 margaritas but it takes 20 min between each drink then they ran out at 11:00ppm. If your going to have a  $1.00 drink sale all month be prepared. Have backup if people call out ect. Plus on top of that I was overcharged 2 drinks. Such bad service I'm never returning."}
{"text":"Worst experience! Also dirty restaurant not one associate cares about their customers ! I will not go here even management doesn't care!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday, my friend, her son, my son, and I met at Applebees to hangout and eat. They have a deal of 2 entrees for $20 with a free appetizer. So, both of us ordered chicken finger baskets for the kids and each of us had the steak, broccoli, and a side order of what we wanted. I had french fries and she had mash potatoes. We both ordered mozzarella sticks. She had a glass of water to go with her meal, I had sierra mist. For the kids, my son had root beer and her son had lemonade. We were too full to eat everything because we had so much food for the four of us plus with the heat here in Las Vegas didn't help us. So we took what was left home for later. The waiter was nice and polite, but the customer service was kinda slow and the thing is IT WAS NOT BUSY!!! The food was good though."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Applebee's for a while, and had never been in this specific location, so decided to try it out. When entering, the first impression was positive, as the restaurant had a warm and comfortable decor. We opted to sit at the bar, as we sometimes do when there are open seats available. (This is a seating preference, even when not consuming alcohol, as was the case on this visit). The chairs at the bar were actually quite comfortable, as they were swivel chairs with padded seats and full back support. We were promptly greeted by the bartender/server and received our beverages very quickly, as well as 2 full menus and a smaller \"happy hour menu\".  We opted for the wings, which were on special for happy hour, as are \"half price appetizers\". We also decided to get some spinach artichoke dip and chips, since they were half price.  The wings came out of the kitchen surprisingly  quickly, and they actually arrived before the chips and spinach dip. (I think the dip took longer to prepare, and it was very yummy when we did receive it, just a few moments after the wings). The food was prepared well and was tasty. We chose 3 different flavors of wings, and each were appropriately seasoned. They weren't the best wings I've ever had, but they were good, especially for the price.  The server provided good service, as she checked in with us regularly, kept our beverages refilled, and also offered to give us \"to-go\" cups when we were preparing to leave. All in all it was a pleasant dining experience, and with the happy hour prices, the tab was actually very affordable. I'm giving it 4 stars, as even though there was nothing spectacular that really made a strong or charismatic impression on me, conversely there was nothing negative to prompt me to rate it any lower."}
{"text":"Applebees has become complacent and relies on being the only chain restaurant in town.  The menu has not changed much since the opening, yet there is zero consistency. The quality of food and portions have decreased while the prices continue to rise."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with 8 of us during my nieces softball tournament. Dinner was good and service was good as well. I left behind my husbands prescription sunglasses and didn't realized for a few hours. The manager at this store was so wonderful she found them and put them away and made sure I got them back. I'm very thankful for her!  So sweet. Thankful for her kindness."}
{"text":"I think that applebee's is one of those places that you can always count on to be consistant, maybe not the best tasting, or your number 1 pick. my GF and i do the 2 for 20 deal alot, i like the steak she likes the fiesta lime chicken, I dont care for applebee's mashed potatoes, and they are always willing to replace them with a baked potato."}
{"text":"Worst service i have seen. Couldnt even be seqted on a slow night!!! Had me waiting for 10 mins Ridiculous! Stay away rather go to chilis."}
{"text":"Wow, very dissapointing! We used to come to this location all the time, but the last two visits has confirmed that this location has taken a turn for the worse. Needless to say, we will not be coming back anymore.  Started off by being seated on a Tuesday night around 5:15p when it wasn't busy. We were greeted by our waitress saying, \"I'll be right with you\". But 10mins later, she finally took our drink orders and we decided to put in our dinner orders at the same time because of the long wait.   Our drinks came quickly, but our appetizer took forever... it was only CHIPS AND SALSA! We got our appetizer, but it pretty much arrived at the same time as our dinner. Food seemed like it was under the warming lights for a long time as the plates were super hot, especially the 3 kids meals that were not brought out earlier like our waitress told us. My son thought he burned his hand on the plate.  We never got our refills or condiments that we asked for. With so much displeasure during our family dinner, we paid at the table's kiosk and got out of there. Th ironic thing was, after I paid and we all put our coats on to leave, our waitress finally stopped by and asked, \"can I get anything else for you tonight?\". After our experience and reading other recent reviews, I would recommend staying clear of this location. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Great place to eat brunch & they have Great draft selection! & the times I've been here I acouple times same server Patricia she's awesome very sweet friendly!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for the late happy hour.  Female, blonde bartender threw a fit because we wanted to sit at the bar.  We left and will never return! !!"}
{"text":"Typically if I have nothing nice to say I opt to say nothing at all.  Based on my latest experience with Applebee's I feel the need to say something.      A friend and I met up for a drink, the total was only $12.20 for the both of us.  I had an appointment to get to so I paid on the convenient little self pay device at the table so my friend and I can get going.  I left a $2.00 and change tip on the machine and my friend left a five dollar bill for our server.      We get up to leave and as we approach the door our server the tall middle aged blonde with a short haircut shouts out in an accusatory tone for the whole restaurant to hear \"DID YOU PAY?\"  Now everyone's eyes are on us like we tried to skip out on our bill.  My friend explained that we did pay and the bill was paid on the machine and she still questioned the fact!      We walked out highly embarrassed after basically being accused of skipping out on a $12.20 bill.  This woman offered no apology after totally embarrassing us in front of the other patrons.      Next time I decide to stop somewhere for a drink after work I definitely will not be stopping at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Worst service in the world!   I thought I'd surprise my husband by picking him up at work for lunch and taking him to Applebee's for a beer. Everything was awful!  From the hostess seating is with no menu, utensils, or even a friendly smile... then the waitress had an attitude because I didn't know what I wanted to order -being as I had NO menu to even look at.    My husband ordered a beer but left his id at work.  She said very rudely that they have to card him saying \"you don't look like you can be my dad\" (my husband is 43 and she was like 30 so no, he may not look old enough to be your dad but we do have a 19 year old daughter so technically yes, he is a dad..) so we asked to speak to a manager.   The manager is even worse!!  I've never been treated this way before and we are not some \"kids\" trying to get drinks we are in our 40's.  I'll never again eat here."}
{"text":"Let me just say first of all, if it wasn't for Nathan the bartender, this place gets a zero for tonight. Basics were definitely lacking - like napkins or settings with food, straws or spoons with my kid's milkshake, refilling drinks when you see its empty (I gave him 3 chances), or the unapologetic pop-in from the manager that lacked any sense for urgency. Yes, she got my napkins and settings finally, to-go boxes, and take home bag, but gee wiz, I can see the reason why our waiter lacked basic serving skills.  Now, Nathan had the urgency and common sense that I was looking for, as he smiled and apologized. I see why people come back to him for beverage service. He is on top of it, which will be the only reason I come back if ever.  The wait staff and manager? Not coming back here to dine. Ever. It wasn't even a rediculously busy night."}
{"text":"Not quite 3 stars but better than 2 so I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt. If its not happy hour it not really worth the price. You can find  much better dishes elsewhere, even nearby, for comparable prices.   Service was OK, the server took awhile to get us our drinks and he forgot to put in our apps. but he did apologize.  Its Applebee's nothing more, nothing less. Predictable chain food, not great and not awful."}
{"text":"Applebees is the only place that can mess up a burger. All around not a good restaurant. Do yourself a favor and don't come here!!!"}
{"text":"The worst applebees in town. Vehicle was broken in to 12 days ago within several items stolen and still no one from management has contacted me for resolution.  Steer clear of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I expected to have a quick lunch with friends in a cool air conditioned restaurant, the server to be attentive and quick and the food to be how I remembered it from my many visits before and that is exactly what I got.   When first arriving to Applebee's the parking lot was empty due to the time of day but it was still clean. Once stepping into the restaurant it was cool which was nice on a hot 105 degree day. There weren't any aromas from the kitchen but it did not smell so that was a plus. The music was very low so it seemed quiet making us not want to talk as loud so we wouldn't disturb over guest. The d√©cor reminded me of a sports bar but it is a family restaurant at the same time.  The restaurant was very clean and well organized. There was a nice flow for the food runners to deliver the food and return back to the restaurant. The bar had an attractive setting to view the options. Our server Allegra was very energetic and upbeat. She came and left swiftly and did not spend too much unwanted time at the table. I had the lunch special of 4 cheese mac-n-cheese and a chicken wrap. The food had a pleasant aroma that I recognized because I order the same thing and it had the same savory sweet taste that I enjoyed. Overall the food did not disappoint me. The highlight of our time was our server. She was very professional but still had great small talk. She had an answer to any question we asked and moved quickly to get out dishes and drinks. I have always enjoyed Applebee's so this time did not disappoint. The restaurant is very comfortable and relaxing. My only suggest would be to turn up the music. I don't want to feel like I have to whisper to my friends during lunch but I will be returning in the future. The service met my expectations."}
{"text":"Yep, a solid 3 stars for this Applebees (which in yelp speak means A-OK)  I like the 3-7pm happy hour and the late night happy hour is good too.  The late night happy hour and trivia makes this a nice break if you want to hang out with friends, but still have a conversation which can be all but impossible at a sports bar.  Pluses: - Recently this location has been getting busier which is a good sign - Food is better than Chilis - The new campaign to serve lunch quickly has suddenly made this a practical consideration for lunch that has to fit within one hour including driving time. - Beer is cheap in happy hour - Friendly staff  Cons: - It's an American corporate chain restaurant, so don't expect gourmet ingredients."}
{"text":"The service was OK.  I went here with a work group during lunch and the only thing on the menu I could eat was fries and onion rings.  They have no meatless and/or dairy free entrees.   I had the \"once frozen\" onion rings and a water and had to stop some where on the way back to work to get some lunch!"}
{"text":"In the north end there is a limit selection on good restaurants in the area, however I haven't had a bad meal at Applebee's for the past few visits to.  I really enjoy the Orchard Salad with Grilled Chicken Breast and I leave both satisfied and a sense of fulfillment as I ate healthy while dining out."}
{"text":"Our waiter was working his butt off with six tables.  We thought he might also be cooking the food and doing the dishes as it took a long time for our food to arrive.  Food was okay, nothing to write home about.  Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is ok, typical Applebee's fare.  Nothing impressive, nothing wonderful, but good for the price.  Unfortunately, they've stopped doing the free kid's meals.  Oh well.  Far more of a factor though is the staff.  I've eaten at Applebee's locations around the nation, and this is some of the worst service I've had.  We waited approximately 45 seconds to be allowed to enter because some guests were chatting with one of the servers and blocking the entrance, ignoring us completely.  We were seated relatively quickly once we were in (the restaurant was only approximately half full).  Our server took a little longer than normal to arrive (approximately 2 minutes instead of the usual 15-45 seconds), so we were ready to order our food at this time.  We placed our order, and about 2 1/2 minutes later she came back with our drinks.  A very reasonable amount of time.  Our appetizer is brought out (by the way, they might be changing the marinara sauce recipe, it seemed closer to ketchup this time).  Our food is brought out, and by this point my wife and I have both nearly finished with our drinks, needing refills.  She ignores this.  The manager walks by multiple times and ignores us.  Other servers ignore us.  When I'm finally able to get our server's attention (after having seen her standing with another table's initial drinks and chatting with another server for several minutes), she scowls at me when I ask her for more drinks.  5 minutes later, she comes back out, scowls at me again, and then goes back to get our drinks.  We're done eating by now, but we finally get our drinks, and ask for our check (no chance of dessert at this point).  About 4 minutes later, our check arrives.  I have my card ready to go, she returns about 2 minutes later to pick it up.  9 minutes later (according to the time between the printout of the original receipt and the printout of the card authorization receipt), she returns with my card, and we leave."}
{"text":"I took a couple of friends here for happy hour we had to wait till the exact time to get the better price, we asked the manager if we could get the happy hour price and she was very firm on no but finally she budged and gave in. Well the food I ordered  was bad it was the blackened fish it smelled really bad it was not fresh so I had them take it back and got something else, that took a while to get that and by the time they brought it back my friends were already done with there meal so I took mine to go. Please approach with caution"}
{"text":"I was dissatisfied with this particular Applebee's, the food was terrible, however the waiter we had was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at Applebee's (ok, actually you get less than what you pay for)  But I mean seriously, it's Applebee's.  If you go in there with no expectations and ignore the fact that their kitchen is probably just freezers and microwaves then you will be fine.  (and if I was basing stars on that alone I would have given it just 2, 'cause I mean...its Applebee's.. However, the beer was cheap and the staff was nice, so it gets brownie points)  I try not to go to places like these, because frankly I think if you are on that much of a budget you should either A.) Go to the grocery store and cook at home or B.) Go to a local place where you can get a better deal and real food. However, on this evening I was walking from the light rail with a friend after leaving the DBacks game, and said friend was exceptionally hungry and not in the mood to walk far..  So we went in.  I was however pleasantly surprised that their happy hour started at 9, which made me feel much better about spending money there.  The beer was a good size, either bigger than a pint or in a deceptively charming glass that makes it look bigger than a pint.  While there wasn't a lot of decent beer choices, they were cheap.  We got a couple of HH apps. and they were as expected, bleh.  But it was food and that was the whole point at that time.. The ranch was sweet... I Hate sweet ranch...gross.  The high point here was the host, he was very pleasant and efficient.  Staff over all was nice really, and the beer was cheap early on, so it served its purpose."}
{"text":"This is the worlds slowest Applebee's! Took 10 minutes for the hostess to set up a table, which she never finished because I told her to just put us in a big booth. Took another 10 minutes for a server to take our drink order. Another 10 minutes to get our drinks- water and 2 beers. Not hard. 25 minutes after that our appetizers appeared and 4 minutes later our entrees came. Well, except for my sons chicken strips which took another 10 minutes. My chicken pasta had obviously been sitting for awhile.  It tasted fine but the service is awful. Don't bother going here. We won't be back ever."}
{"text":"If you go to this location and have the server brandon, run for the hills! I'm not one to complain about servers but my fianc√© and I left genuinely annoyed and irritated. no personality, took 20 minutes to get our salads. then our actual meal came out 5 minutes later. seriously. I had finished my drink before i finished my food since it took so long to get our food so you would think I would of gotten a refill. nope. walked past me three times and didn't offer me a refill. resorted to eating the ice in my glass.  the food was fine.   won't be returning to this location"}
{"text":"We stopped in to this Applebee's tonight and had such a great experience! When we couldn't decide on orders, off menu items were made to order AND were perfect! Cherise was funny, agreeable, and accommodating! Cord helped with an allergy issue and both made this otherwise \"long day\" a relaxing retreat! :) I hope they stick around so we can come back again soon!"}
{"text":"The worst Applebee's we have been to.    I don't expect too much from these places; get the order right and serve the food hot.  Neither happened with out drinks and dinner.  Moreover, service was very substandard.  We weren't the only I satisfied customers, we could hear/see several people sending their meals back.  Management here needs to fix the kitchen and train wait staff in basic service."}
{"text":"We were only interested in desserts.  My husband and I sat in the bar for 5mins and were never acknowledged.  They were NOT busy.  Then asked the hostess to seat us, we explained the situation regarding the bar.  We were seated and again were never greated by a server.  6 more mins pass.  Perhaps we we invisible.   There was a manager talking business with a couple at the booth behind us...we explained the situation to him, his response was,  \"were you sitting at the bar or a table in the bar\"?  Are you kidding me.  Who cares which it was.  Their service is terrible.  The staff is mediocre at best.  We were reminded why we don't eat at Applebee's. I would've given less than 1 star if that was an option."}
{"text":"I like the food don't take me wrong is just the price, quantity n quality of the food don't seem to be equal, but nice place to have some fun with friends and family..."}
{"text":"So went to Applebee's on 51st Ave last night to have some drinks and appetizers with two friends and got cut off by the manager after 3 rounds! None of us were driving as we had previously arranged for rides home and we explained that to the 'I've only been here 72 hours' new manager from Maine. Before he cut us off he came to our table introduced himself, shook our hands, and chatted with us regarding establishments being liable for serving patrons too much. We totally agreed and explained that's why all 3 of us were drop off and will be picked up at the end of the evening.  Long and short been there and received horrible service many times before so I would give them 6 months before returning and see if the improved but I think this  was it for me. Finished the evening at the Greathouse and had a blast, great drinks, food, and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few Applebee's before and I can't say the food or service was bad. With this location, the question is, how long do you have to wait for your meal? ( esp. when the place is half empty) After 15 minutes maybe the server could say your meal will be here soon or would you care for some tortilla chips while you're waiting? After 20 minutes, still nothing......25 minutes ...no food, no response from the server. At 30 minutes, sorry Applebee's .... You've been Chopped! I'm out of here."}
{"text":"I don't usually complain and honestly I don't usually go to Applebee's but yesterday was an experience that I wouldn't like to repeat. It went okay at the beginning but after I finished my first cup of coffee I couldn't get a refill until after my food arrived. When I then finished my food I was waiting for a good while before my check came. Between the times that I ordered and got my food I didn't see my server once. The manager came by to see if I needed anything once but I didn't see him after that either. When my check did come I was charged for a tab with 32.00 when my entire tab was under fifteen. I know that everyone has an off day and I hope that was the case!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this applebees. In my opinion every one I have had not so pleasant service. This location i has good service once. I just love the food and the menu prices fit my budget. Other than that decent."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are regulars here! Its a fast meal when I dont feel like cooking so I make sure to swing by after physical therapy (AFC) to snag some food on the way home... We had a great time and i was going to post something last night but my battery was dying... The server was great, some rocker chick, I forget her name cuz we were drinking, she was awesome!!  We had the two for 20 meals... I ALWAYS get the rib basket and wifey always gets something that sounds healthy... Food was spectacular, but the salad was awkward because of the hot bacon vinagrette dressing, it wasn't for me...But all in all great time EVEN though it wasn't happy hour... Was cheaper then I thought... Sorry no pics... I was spending more time with my wife then the electronics and basketball game that was going on!! We love Applebee's!!"}
{"text":"WOW. I just had double jaw surgery and this place was totally compensating of the fact I could not chew. Not only did they blend my food for me (where most places will not) they actually did it specifically to my instructions.   Not only that but they offered to blend everything else as well. I am so impressed   On top of that the customer service was fantastic - I was in and out of here in just a little over an hour during dinner rush!!   Could not be happier, even tho I live in the SW I will be a regular for sure.   Thanks applebees!!"}
{"text":"Order took a long time to arrive (1 hr). Rag to clean dropped on floor still used to clean DINING table. Server always in a rush and spilled water on me and friend. Other tables around are left uncleaned."}
{"text":"Slowwwww service, food was cold and we ordered appetizers. No server was friendly, and we ordered 2 perfect margaritas with hardly any liquor in them. Bland, bland, bland."}
{"text":"Don't go here.  When we arrived we were told there would be a 25 minute wait.  The place was only half full. We finally got seated but I'm pretty sure the waiter was kitchen staff who had never taken orders. Excessive wait time, terrible food and service. We were never checked on once during the meal.  They were out of Pepsi. (Odd). I watched two other tables get up and leave as they had waited so long to be waited on. Something is going on there and it isn't good. I paid my bill just so we could get out of there.  Waste of time and money. My guess is that the place will soon be closed. Stay away"}
{"text":"Would love to leave negative stars.  Wasn't my choice to come here, but after a day spent to my bridal shower my family and I just wanted to get a quick bite to eat without doing dishes. We headed down Bell road at 7 on a Saturday night and Applebees was the only place without a wait...should've been a red flag.  I try to not come to places like this for anything but happy hour because they are well... crappy... but my diabetic mother had already waited long enough and we just needed to get her food.  We waited at the host stand for about 5 minutes... should've just left.  A manager finally came to seat us, no apologies, no personality, just a patronizing shell of a person.  Was more interested in making sure he got his canned sales pitch out and to make very, very clear that we understood happy hour was not going on right now... oy!  Another five minutes go by and we finally get one asswipe of a server.  I could go on and on about his attitude and lack of service, but frankly the more I write the more I realize that we should've never come to this hell hole to begin with and it is our fault for wasting our money here.  Long story short, server was rude and pushy while he was there, then put in our food order and disappeared.  He was spending more time sitting with the table next to us on his phone.  Our food came out after tables that ordered after us. Our food was nasty and cold.  The manager didn't care about either, but told us not to tip the server if we weren't happy.  While I am usually one to give at least 10% for the worst service ever (heck, just \"average\" service gets you 20% from me), this guy was quite possibly the worst of the worst...and besides his manager endorsed not tipping the idiot, so we just left the change on this one and he came BURSTING OUT THE BACK DOOR AND CHASING US THROUGH THE PARKING LOT!  Oh and there was the same creeper smoking next to the entrance when we walked in and when we left.... a mere 10 feet from the door.  sigh.  $40 worth of frozen, improperly described (calling a button mushroom dish a portabello mushroom dish) nasty food, came out wrong and old tasting. Patronizing manager.  Jerky disappearing server who harassed us through the parking lot.  Yeah, our bad...shouldn't of even walked through the door."}
{"text":"Well the wife and I tried an Applebee's in another part of town and there was a very long so we decided to try a different one. So we came to this one and to our surprise there was no wait and open tables even though it was in a much busier part of town. So we were seated pretty quickly bit from then on it went down hill. To sum it up the food was awful and I even had it replaced and it was still awful after that. It only went from old food to overly salted food. And the service was very poor at best as well. We just sat around for 30 minutes waiting for silverware and we even asked 3 times for it. So even with all of these problems you would think that at least your beer would be fine. But guess what it wasn't. I love getting draft beer from the bottom of the keg. It's great when it's completely flat. So please folks and take this review seriously and avoid this place completely. I now know why this place had a ton of tables open with no wait. Just head over to the Applebee's on northern if your feeling like Applebee's."}
{"text":"Walked in saw 2 tables open right in the front was told 20 minute wait I waited 20 minutes to be sat in the tank right in the front that was open the whole time the server randy was slow took him 10 minutes to take our drink order and another 10 to bring it probably longer because we walked out unorganized a waste of time stupid employees and the seats have no seperatetion from everyone else I'll never return to this apple bees the parking is shit to I'm now at I'm 43rd and peoria at applebees within 20 minutes already ordered our food thw drive 5 miles to this one is worth not going back to that shity one on northern"}
{"text":"Thank you Applebee's for providing a place close by for my family and friends to meet up and relax late night over the holidays! I love that you are open late during the week, have a late night happy hour, and above all, serve Christmas Ale! I think over Christmas break I came here 3 times in one week.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd try after our last disappointing visit. We used to frequent this Applebee's over the year but something's changed. The service has been consistently poor. The server ignored us for at least 30 minutes before coming to our table. She initially greeted me as she was walking by without stopping.  I arrived early for dinner and waited for my coworker. She never brought us appetizer plates and dropped a couple of napkins again while walking by without stopping. We shouldn't have left 15% tip but we are both heavy tippers so I thought 15 would send a message. The service was disappointing for being a slow evening and the food was just ok. The meat nachos my friend had contained blobs of fat she couldn't eat.  Kinda disgusting. Oh well we will find a new place for dinner and happy hour. I would give 1+1/2 stars being the cocktail was ok and the host was pleasant."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Applebee's for a long time, but decided to give them one more chance.  What a mistake!  Walked in, waited 10 minutes for a hostess.  Even the customers that came in after us went to go find one, but couldn't.  Finally, one comes up and asks to help us.  We told her a party of 3 - she then asks to take our name because she needs to check and see what tables are available.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  We've already waited 10 minutes, the dining room is over half empty - how about just seating us at an open table.  We just told her than we were leaving - her comment to us was to \"have a nice day!\"  How about an apology for having to wait 10 minutes for nothing!  By the way where are the managers?  MAYBE someone should be in the dining room at dinner time.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"Me an my fiance came here for day time cocktails an food. After being seated we didnt get a hello, I'll be with you in a second, until about 10 minutes later. Ordered a drink an water didnt get that for about 15 min. So we decided to move to the bar ordered food drinks an service was just moving slow. The bartender charged me for items i didnt even receive. Unfortunately she was to focused on her 1 main customer who usually comes in an i guess tips her pretty good. Anywho service was terrible she wasn't focused. The host had better customer service skills than any one in the resturant. Won't be going back there for daytime anything."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food not good. Non helpful staff. Would not recommend coming here. We were here for 1 hr before we even got our food. Try another location."}
{"text":"Now I remember why we don't come here in the past couple years.. Ok come in , request table for 2.. 4 people that come in 10 minutes after us go right to a table, we ask why we weren't seated there since we request a table... She says because that's a large table.. Um ok so if there's only 2 of you then u get seated sometime after larger parties .. Get seated and no shit 14 minutes later we stop someone to maybe order.... Just crap service... Crap food.., will NOT be back"}
{"text":"Entry- 2 ladies standing there. Both seem to have zero idea of how to seat anyone. Their looking around the empty restaurant trying to figure out the size of parties etc...  finally to seat- tall bald gentleman comes over. To the point just no personality at all. When he brought over the appetizer and sat it done he actually said \"here\" and disappeared. We don't come here a lot and now I recall why.  Husband got the bourbon street shrimp and chicken. He had to put the shrimp on the skillet so hopefully theyd cook a little more... I got the whiskey burger. Nothing special just a blah burger. Won't be back. Waiter needs to be friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Feeble attempt at service.  C'mon if I order a Turkey Bacon avocado sandwich, then put Bacon on it.  Unfortunately the server didn't check back with us until after we had finished.  Didn't offer to fix anything.  YOU OWE ME SOME BACON that I paid for.  Thank god for surveys and yelp to vent."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved on this side of town and have ordered from this applesbees 3 time. The first time they got our order wrong and we had to drive back. The second time they got our order wrong and we had to drive back. And here now the 3rd and final time they got our order wrong and I am not even going to send my husband back we are just not going to order from them any more. Let's get it together applesbees. A rack of ribs and some fiesta lime chicken is not to complicated."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews written by others...I can't help but to think that at least it wasn't just us. Service is OK but the food is very hit or miss. When I moved to the Laveen area; I was glad that there was a recognizable restaurant so close to home but our first visit resulted in a glass/plastic shard in one of our entrees (salad). So we didn't go back for a long time but when we did; again the food was just poor. The 3rd time got us another salad issue (brown wilted lettuce) and a chicken entr√©e with rubbery rice. I think 3x is enough is say that this Applebee's is just never going to be a good place to eat."}
{"text":"dam it. another bad one.. just have to say bad just bad. severs sucks and the bartender does not care about making a dime. If you like waiting a hour and a half for 1 beer and wings go right ahead and come here"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Sitting at the bar and never asked if I wanted a menu or anything else, it's been 20 minutes and still neither bartender had asked me if I want anything.  I left. It was awful."}
{"text":"Start off with saying happy hour is the best. It's always a good feel vibe. Music is usually on point. The service can be hit or miss with it being busy some nights and not so busy other nights. You should always check out the mozzarella sticks or some wings for an appetizer. And then just snack on appetizers complimented with a cold beer and you're good!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Applebee's and always saw them around. I try to avoid chain restaurants as a whole, but I had to meet a group there one night. Surprisingly, the food was good. I had the quesadilla burger, which was different  but tasty. I also tried the artichoke dip and deep-fried, batter-coated green bans, which I loved! The others with me also enjoyed their food. Also, the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"I went to this Applebee's on Stephanie's because of the great service and food I experienced at the one on Nellis. What a difference a location makes! We were there for a while and were disappointed that no one checked on us for anything, such as refills, etc. after our waitress closed out the ticket and went home. I think that is such bad service. I guess the other workers figured they weren't going to get a tip from us so why bother providing us service. We tried to use the service computer screen at our table to order some other things, but that didn't work. I'll still give it 2 stars because I still liked the food and my fav. deep fried green beans."}
{"text":"I don't go to Applebees often, and whenever I go to this one it reminds me of why.  This one, out of all the ones I have been too, has horrible service.  The waiters just seem so unfocused and the food really isn't that good.  I'd rather go to Chilis down the street."}
{"text":"We came coz we got a gift card and it reminded us why we don't come here.    1.  They said the wait time is 5, it was more 15 mins.  2.  Twisted Potatoes were very SALTY.  3.  Kids chicken finger, server told us they have to bring another piece of chicken which never came.  They did give us a 10% discount."}
{"text":"They overlooked my burger when I asked for pink twice. Then manager was rude and I waited an hour for my meal when there was only 10 people max. So frustrated."}
{"text":"This is a good Applebee's location , from my personal experience even better than the summerlin location in Boca park, on my visits here I had to wait for a table all the time but not too long it's decent busy location  servers always been attentive enough and food never disappointed.  It's an Applebee's you don't have to have expectation for fine dining service and food. Like other are complaining about the service food and refills etc... common people it's just decent food and service for the price you are paying..."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Charlotte area and my family and I decided to order out one night. I did a fairly large order online on a weeknight and went to pick it up at the restaurant. When I arrived there were several servers standing around the bar area talking, I'm assuming because it was a slow night. I told the bartender that I was there to pickup an order and she decided that her conversation with her coworker was more important than serving a customer. I waited for about 10 minutes ( my requested pickup time at the time was about 15 minutes prior to this) and my food came out. I checked my order, and saw that I was missing a dessert (maple blondie to be exact) I told the bartender what I was missing, she whispered to who coworker who then decided to come over and take a look in my bag as if I wasn't telling the truth. I had to wait for another 10-15 minutes for them to prepare what I requested. I didn't receive an apology, or a thank you; I was just handed another bag. The food was subpar to say the least. I highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out Goodfood best service. The bartender is the best his name is Dustin. He will take care of you from A-Z"}
{"text":"I took my mom and dad here for dinner and as usual, the food is always good and the server was on his game.    Personally , I think the food is a little over priced!"}
{"text":"Worst food -- I've tried this Applebees in Mt Pleasant, PA three times and I give up.  My party had ordered the fried shrimp dinner -- over fried (dark, no taste, over crunchy), the American hamburger for the 2 for 20 -- no pickle, onion and a spot of sauce, lime chicken as cold and really messy, you couldn't find the chicken.  What has happened to this restaurant? With three tries-- Applebees has struck out.  I and my party will never go back again.  Better to drive across the road and eat at Wendy's or Arby's.  Best little restaurant is Smillies up the road -- I haven't had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"I was at this location not too long ago, & I have to say it wasn't like it usually is. It seemed like we were just being rushed in and out. Our waitress(Didn't give us her name) was a bit rude. Whenever we tried to order an appetizer she just dropped our drinks on the table and walked off! It also took forever to just get a refill when the place wasn't even half full. We had ordered the soup and salad and that also took more than what it needed to be, & of course when she did bring it by she once again just whisked off before we could ask for a refill. Obviously she wasn't tipped."}
{"text":"At first, when the fine meat, referred to as the \"Half Rack Double-Glazed Baby Baby Ribs\" was laid upon the table, I was apprehensive. But once  the tender meat rubbed against my rough throat, I was filled with a euphoric sensation of bliss. A sort of \"Pouvez-vous r√©p√©ter\" if you catch my drift. But once the soft flesh of the deceased cow began to settle in, as my nostrils began to warm up, I understood what it truly means to be happy. After exiting the Applebee's, entering my 1994 Ford Pinto, I remembered what it was like before this transformative experience, hoping never to lose this  feeling. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Was not crowded.  Was waited on promptly.  It took way too long to get our food and it was an easy order....the lunch specials.  I definitely saw another  couple come in after us, receive there food and were just about finished before our food even came.  My club  sandwich was not warm to any degree.  The toasted bread was soggy on the bottom.  I'm sure it had been sitting back in the kitchen for a while.  The only redeeming part of this visit is that their strawberry lemonade is pretty darn good.  Overall it was a visit that did not make me wish to return, at least for a good while.  Might try it again when I crave  another lemonade."}
{"text":"Selection on the menu are becoming more scarce each time we dine here, leaves us wondering what type of clientele they're targeting."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating at an Applebee's establishment was last Monday. Apparently the have happy hour here from 9-until close. We arrived around 9:30 so our margaritas were only 3 bucks. We also ordered off of the 550 calorie & under menu which consisted on us getting a steak or chicken variation. The food as well as the service was very good. I bought drinks for myself & a friend plus my food brought our bill to only $27. All in all a pretty nice experience for a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Half of a star wasn't an option, so one star. I'm really not even sure where to begin. First, we waited 25+ minutes in a restaurant that only had two tables filled, and four people at the bar. Two gentlemen at the bar, visibly inebriated, were yelling  belligerently across the bar at two women, using terms such as, \"bring that ass over here\" while striking the countertop of the bar. After the two women went to them, their conversations quickly escalated to clearly audible sexual remarks such as, \"let me see that ass, that motherf**ker fat\" and \"twerk something right quick\", as the gentleman proceeded to strike her on her behind. In addition to this wonderful scene happening 5' from our table, the portion size of the appetizers were incorrect (much less), and were overcharged on each bill. We were simply attempting a full send for half price appetizers, but had an absolute brutal experience instead. You have lost my business."}
{"text":"I'm  not a fan or a regular customer of Applebee's due to a previous visit to another location. This time my daughter wanted to go so we went. I'm giving only 2 stars because I saw the same attitude of the employees. They don't care who walks in the door. The manager was talking out loud at the bar to some employee about checking their schedule. Very inappropriate to do in front of customers out loud in an open space. Very unprofessional. The food improved but still lacking consistency with the seasoning. Chicken was not seasoned and potatoes were bland no flavor. Abryana, our server was good, but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst Applebee's ever dirty smells like a MacDonald's play place awful food and even worse service never again will I eat here and I like apple bees but this one was bad food made be feel sick and nothing was remotely clean menus had greesy hand prints on them and on and on. BTW the waitresses are not attractive and that's a must to top it off ."}
{"text":"I ate here late evening on April 20th and had a steak. I ended up getting food poisioning from eating here. My daughter was born on April 22nd early in the morning and I spent the whole time doing the two affects food poisoning have on you in the delivery room. The nurse ended up having to nurture to my pregnant girlfriend and I at the same time. Unfortunately I was unable to enjoy the true experience, of the birth of my daughter, due to me being sick from a steak I ate here. I can honestly say I would never step foot in this Applebee's or any other after that. In addition to that it was by far not the best \"service\" I've received at a resturant."}
{"text":"Decent food. Not enough beers on tap. Service was average. Great location in the heart of shopping. They do have half price appetizers thru the week. Also drinks specials."}
{"text":"I try to stay away because of the food. Last time I had the chicken parmesan and the tomato sauce was horrible no flavor or spices at all. The service and atmosphere is always amazing for my family. They should work more on their menu."}
{"text":"So this is most likely my last time coming to this AppleBees. The last time before today we came our appetizers alone took almost 45 - 50 minutes to come out &' 4/5 tables including mine had the wrong items brought to us. Then we asked for waters that we never even received! Once we were ready to go we waited 25 minutes just to get to go boxes. However I chalked it up as maybe they had new hires that were learning! Today (April 7) we came in and spent 110$ on food and drinks alone without including the tip we left. Now I usually don't care to leave reviews but I had to I ordered pasta and the sauce on the pasta was sooo thin it was like I was eating pasta and water cheese. The artichoke dip was extremely odd tasting can't quite put my finger on what was wrong with it. My friends chicken was over cooked and hard she didn't even care to finish her food after two bites and the second dollarita I ordered tasted completely like juice there was almost like there was NO alcohol in there. Normally we don't complain but I spent over 100$ tonight and felt like I just wasted my money. On top of that my wife purposely didn't have lunch so she could have room for food and her food was soo greasy she's currently throwing up as I'm giving this review. I won't say don't eat here because your experience may be better than mines but after tonight I'll drive the extra 2/3 miles to go to another apple bees or another restaurant ."}
{"text":"I have been to many different Applebee's locations and I've never experienced anything like this. We went in late in the evening and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. The waitress helping us didn't come to our table to get our drink order for almost 10 minutes. Everything thereafter felt like it was moving in slow motion. Our appetizers took forever, and we sat with empty glasses for so long to the point that other servers got us drinks twice. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen to even ask her for drinks. At one point she was even talking to the table near us, complaining about how long she had been there and how management does the schedule, about her family issues and whatever else, while we sat there still with no drinks or food. My husband and I ordered burgers pink, and they both came out burnt to heck, they were actually crunchy, with no pink. I wanted to send mine back, but again, she was nowhere to be seen. I ordered my burger with nothing but grilled onions, and apparently they charge extra for them which I was not told. Some of the onions were burnt and the others were almost raw and I ended up taking them all off but somehow paying extra for them. She never came back after giving us our food to check on us or refill our drinks. I hardly ate mine. We paid on the electronic kiosk and left feeling like we wasted our money. We could have gone to any other restaurant in the area and spent the same amount and actually enjoyed our food. I don't expect wonders from chain restaurants but customer service and professionalism is appreciated."}
{"text":"My husband had a hair in his food, discovered in his broccoli, on his first bite. The server came by to remake his food. The manager, Jason I believe, came to the table. This is when the evening took a turn for the worse. He came over with an accusatory attitude, claiming he didn't know where the hair came from, as all the cooks are bald. We never once asked for anything free, simply the plate remade. As we have both worked food service, we both know the hair could have come from prep, or another waitress, such as the one who delivered the food. However, as he was on the opposite side of the table from me, and the hair was straight (my hair is naturally kinky curly), it was impossible to have been mine. The manager felt the need to state 'for all I know, the hair could have come from this table'. That was a direct quote. That was absolutely unacceptable. After telling him I didn't wish to speak to him anymore, and the number for his supervisor, he became very argumentative, and once again accusatory. I told him multiple times I didn't wish to speak with him, yet he insisted on standing right there yelling and speaking down to me and my family. My husband didn't even get a bite out of his steak, yet we were accused of putting hair in the food. That makes absolutely no sense. As we have both worked food service, we understood accidents happen. With a new plate of food, the issue would have been resolved. The manager coming over to blame us for the hair, was not ok."}
{"text":"The food was great as always. But Ben the server tried to charge us for every item we picked instead of 2 for 8. He fixed the problem but then proceeded to tell me that it was my job to let him know exactly what I wanted next time so it's less confusing. Last I checked I'm pretty sure that was the servers job. Thanks for fixing it Ben but next time don't make the customer feel responsible for you mistake. Thanks."}
{"text":"We had a Birthday with 32 people. They were very accommodating. He had plenty of help from Ana, Diana and the rest of the staff. A special thanks to Hazel! He was very patient and made sure we had everything we needed. We were very well taken care of. Thank you all again for making our family night hassle free and delicious."}
{"text":"Very clean ! The food was good and the workers were all so friendly . Perfect place to go to off the strip and good prices."}
{"text":"Gets 4 stars because the meal was good and the server was okay he could have been better, The woman who seated me was a beotch who gave me a dirty attitude for wanting a regular table and not one of those ones in the bar wit the tall chairs. Did not bring out p plate for my rib bones like the other Applebees have done had to wait for a refill of my drink which lowered my tip."}
{"text":"First off this review really should be for Jan 2015, but I didn't have Yelp then or at least wasn't on it enough.   I ordered a 9 oz steak from here for pick up. First it was ready 30 minutes later then the pick up time so I was stuck waiting in my car. Then I got home and my steak was was medium well when I wanted it well done and made that very clear on the phone, because I was 4 months pregnant and we all know the dangers of raw meat. So I was starving and tried to cook it for longer to get it to well done in my oven when I really should have thrown it away. I got the worst food poisoning of my life...and I was pregnant. Make sure that you cook the food according to what the person asks for and also something else must have happened from it sitting that long for me to be that ill.   Needless to say I will never ever go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Found a metal chicken leg wire in my 1st bite of the chicken tacos! Omg really the manager was very quick to take the napkin I put it on. Then says how sorry he was he wasn't sure how it got into the food. Then gave me a free kids meal. If that was in the chicken what is in the other meat products. GROSS"}
{"text":"So tired of coming here for there goddess salad and the wedge being so small this time it seemed to be sitting in the fridge awhile the lettuce was real limp"}
{"text":"Ever since Angela moved to another location the management has went way downhill.  This establishment has great employees, but if they don't revamp the management, it's gonna keep going downhill."}
{"text":"By far the worst service ever, food was cold ,Staff very unprofessional specially the bartenders never asked us how our food was , talking to other co workers about other customers, I couldn't believe my boyfriend and I even stayed to eat our dinner. (We were just hungry and tired) Definitely not returning to this location and wouldn't recommend it !!!!!"}
{"text":"After waiting several minutes a family of 5 came in African American asked for Michelle also African American. The family appeared to know each other. The hostess helping us said can you sit at this table located in bar. Yes ..Were cleaning it now.the aggressive family whispered to Michelle who grabbed menus and sat them at our wsiting table although we had been wanting 15 minutes and same amount of people in our party.  Michelle was rude and the hostess told her they were her first..she first walked the loud lady over came back and got the kids and the man went to sit down later..when i brought this up oh sorry it will be a few more minutes..we left we wont ever return.rude rude Michelle practice what you preach on MLK day.."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. The staff is really nice and quick. I have had a great experience every time. Jenni is the best. She is always smiling and is very attentive to her tables."}
{"text":"Nice frIendly place. Always great service. The food is really good. I have tried several items on the menu and have always been happy with everything I have eaten. We love to go here to watch football on Sunday while we have lunch."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for reasonable prices until I started realizing how shitty the food is. I just go for happy hour because my boyfriend likes the wings and I do enjoy a Long Island here and there, but this time was terrible. We didn't even get acknowledged walking in, we sat ourselves at the bar, my boyfriend ordered his wings and a Pepsi and I got a water. She got the wings to us pretty quickly and then after that she completely just forgot about us. She was too busy chatting with her friends that came to visit. Served them drink after drink and didn't even give us a refill until we were about ready to go. When she finally gave ME a refill, she completely ignored the fact my boyfriend needed one too. She rushed off to make yet another drink for her friends. My boyfriend had to yell check just to get her attention and give us our check because otherwise she would have left us sitting there. After she gave us our check she again left to make her friends another drink failing to ask if everything was alright and forgot about us again, my boyfriend had to wave his check in the air for her to notice. I've had pretty good service at Applebee's until tonight. She just completely ignored us and went on taking care of her friends."}
{"text":"Always fun having drinks and food there. Depending on who's your server you'll get your food and drink promptly. Tv's always have games on and the news. Good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"GLASS IN OUR FOOD!  Let me begin by saying that, we were regular patrons of this location prior to Monday's experience. As a family, we have probably visited this location every 1-2 months over the last year since it's close and convenient.   I think the restaurant was busy because of the Dr. MLK holiday. We seemed to beat the rush and were seated quickly. While our section was full, our server was pleasant and attentive. She kept our drinks filled and continued to check on us throughout our meal.  Since my daughter had a friend with us for the day, we decided to order dessert for the girls. We ordered two triple chocolate meltdowns that come with ice cream to share. The girls had one and the rest of us had the other. With his 2nd bite of ice cream, by dad discovered a very sharp piece of glass that he immediately spit out. We were disgusted and horrified that this was in our food and relieved that it had not been in the dish that the girls were sharing. Luckily, my Dad did not swallow this shard of glass and did not cut his tongue either.  We alerted our server who apologized and went to contact the manager. The manager walked by our table twice, but we were not able to get his attention. Our server finally alerted him and he eventually made it over to our table. After showing him the shard of glass, his only response was to tell us that \"there is no glass by the ice cream in the kitchen\" and asked if we wanted him to remove the dessert from our bill (none of us wanted to eat the rest of the dessert and most of it was left on the table). He didn't apologize or make any attempt to ensure that this wouldn't happen to any other diners who ordered ice cream after us.   Our server pushed the manager to make a further apology by taking $10 off our bill. We appreciated the offer and our server's effort (we didn't think she was at all to blame for the incident), but we will NEVER be going back to this or any other Applebee's again. The manager needs some customer service skills and our server needs a raise.  I hope no one else had or finds glass in their food."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I will start at the beginning. I walked in the door at about 11:15pm. I stood at the door for at least 2 minutes before being acknowledged. At least 5 different servers looked me in the face and continued to scurry around the restaurant without a single, \"Hello,\" \"Someone will be right with you,\" \"Welcome,\" NOTHING!!!!! So the bartender DJ saw we were there and greeted us. I told her that several servers had looked at us and kept walking and we had been standing there. She was gracious enough to leave her post at the bar and seat us. I asked her to send the manager over so that I could speak to him about what just happened. She gave us menus and took our drink orders immediately. We thanked her. She continued to check on us and make sure we were good. The manager never came. We ordered and our food came. We ordered several different items, most of which we have had before. One of my favorites are the double crunch wings with the Asian chile sauce. We ordered those and they came out soggy and loose.   I asked DJ what drink she recommended and she recommended a raspberry lemon drop and it was AMAZING!!! It was literally the highlight of the night along with her service!!!  DJ the bartender came over to check on us and I let her know that the wings were not crunchy and showed her the loose skin. She apologized and immediately went to take them to the kitchen and get us more wings. The manager Dave brought a new set of wings or and it was the same problem. I told him of my issue and he began to make excuses and tell me hat they couldn't get any crispier without being burned. I then informed him that I've had the double crunch wings before and I know what to expect and it's not loose chicken. So he said he would go and make them himself.  As if things couldn't get any worse, While waiting on our chicken my friend found a hair in her Pub Philly Sandwich. So we of course sent that back. DJ came to the rescue on this too and was extremely apologetic  Minutes later the manager Dave came with the wings and they were not right again. The manager Dave proceeded to give excuses like, \"oh they aren't meant to sit because of the sauce.\" I informed him that I've had them before and have eaten them the next day and they still had a crunch. He never even came back. DJ took the food back explained it to him and she explained the bill! I feel our whole meal should've been comped but it wasn't.   DJ the bartender's EXCELLENT service is the only reason this review got one star. But she really gave 5 Star service!!! She was so much more accommodating than the manager Dave the entire night! If you ask me she needs to be promoted to manager!!!"}
{"text":"Came here the day after Valentines. We walked in and were seated right away. But then I realized a server hadn't come up and did there normal things like greet us and ask us if we wanted any drinks. 10 minutes go buy and still no server then I realized there was like a tablet there and then to my knowledge it said call server. I had never seen that before! So I press the button and we waited about another 10 minutes for someone to come up and ask if we wanted a drink and if we knew what he wanted to eat, so we finally ordered and got our drinks. What I thought was cool was the little tablet let you order appetizers to your table. But it only did appetizers and desserts. It took us a while to keep getting a server for refills or sauce. And most of the servers just kept walking past. No one ever asked us if we were ok or if we needed anything. Probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Waited for drink. Only needed water. He forgot the lemon. OM goodness. Waited 5 more minutes.  Food was good. Artichoke spinach dip and wings. Well if you are thirsty don't come here."}
{"text":"This was a really good choice.  We came with a party of six and everything went smoothly.   The food was great and so was the service.  They also have really cool touch pads on each table now but I tried to pay and it wouldn't accept Visa.  Not sure why but nevertheless it was still cool."}
{"text":"Applebee's has always been a great place to go to for food. They always provide amazing drinks and good food, the food is never off. The only complaint I really have is that the atmosphere isn't all the greatest. It's typically a bit noisy and you have to be lucky to be served with great service. Nonetheless it's a great place to go for an eat."}
{"text":"I have not been to Applebees in a long time, and I was reminded why a few nights ago. I had a gift card from Christmas, so my boyfriend and I thought we would use it. The service was good, and we decided to get the two for $25 deal. The spinach dip we started with as an appetizer was good, but the chips were stale. I ordered ribs with a side of broccoli, and while the broccoli was good, the ribs were terrible. Overcooked and not enough sauce. I usually just older the oriental chicken rollup when I go there, and I won't be straying from that order anymore when, or if, I go back."}
{"text":"One of the better applebees ive been too. Service was great. Power went out when we were there and they comped us free dessert."}
{"text":"If I could rate it 0 stars I would. Called in a reservation and they didn't even remember it. The service was horrible, slower than anything ever. Don't go you will be stuck for hours waiting on food."}
{"text":"My husband and I meet friends at Applebee's for dinner. The door was opened for us by a smiling young man that welcomed us to the restaurant. Another very polite young man showed us to our table. We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu. I had the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken and my husband had the Shrimp Wonton Stir Fry. Both of us had the side salads. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. The salad was fresh and quite large. I'm surprised by the amount I'd food we had for $20. Our waitress was also friendly and efficient. A very good dining experience at this Applebee's location."}
{"text":"Terrible service - no follow up on our orders took us 45 minutes to get drinks and appetizers. Food was cold- Birthday celebration three small children- terrible service- waitress called us liars; manager apologized on her behalf- St. Patty's day and it was emptiness the place. Camelback and Central Ave"}
{"text":"It took us a bit to be seated but we expected that for a Monday night football night. We needed to get in and out quickly and the on table order and pay system really sped up that process. The food was great, I had the Blazin Texas burger...amazing!! And the nachos were on point also. Definitely try those two!"}
{"text":"Getting over the flu. Went for a walk with my hungry teen. Unfortunately stopped in. Was given dirty plates. Waitress gave my teen someone else's drink. When we tried to tell her she rudely brushed us off. Forgot to serve appetizer. Another person brought our food. I mentioned the forgotten appetizer but said it was alright to leave off. The other server nicely comped the forgotten appetizer. When we got the bill the drink meant for someone else was on it. When I pointed it out to our original waitress, she offhandedly said it made up for the appetizer she didn't charge us and began to walk away! I explained the other server comped it. She looked annoyed then mumbled under her breath it was because we never ordered it and walked away to check to see if we were comped. When she returned she hovered to see if I would leave a tip for my tipid soup and teen's greasy burger. I didn't. Will NEVER go back ."}
{"text":"My experience here was quite pleasant. My server was very polite and attentive. I got my tea and water in less than 1 minute and I got my food within 10 minutes. The food was amazing and the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Our fav spot for happy hour! We always order the hot wings and a blue moon... The manager is usually here and always comes over asks how we are doing..."}
{"text":"Nothing off the charts but not bad for a simple lunch or dinner or to meet up with some friends."}
{"text":"USED to be one of my favorite places but the quality has gone down majorly. Many things I loved no longer on menu. Got artichoke dip and chips were bendable and glistening with grease as if they were old and sitting around.  Got honey chicken Mac n cheese and looked like cheese had been sitting for a while and not fresh and colder then should be.  Managers used to walk around asking how things were and there was no sign a manager even there.  Hate writing bad reviews especially on places I used to love and go weekly to but this isn't the same place anymore."}
{"text":"I can't say enough bad things about this place but I'll name a few but if you're reading this with thoughts of eating here, DON'T. Go eat ELSEWHERE.   STELLA made the top 2 of The Worst Server Ever list.   It took about 30 minutes to get an order of cheese sticks. I'd ordered it with Ranch dressing and the server forgot to bring it so about 10 minutes later I tracked her down at the booth behind us and asked for the Ranch dressing, about 10 minutes after asking she stopped by with some weird paper cup with dressing in it. It didn't matter at that point, the cheese sticks were cold.  After an extremely long wait dinner was served but then I realized we didn't have napkins. I couldn't find anyone to help so I ended up going to the bar and grabbing a stack of drink napkins. My husbands order was incorrect but we once again couldn't locate our server and at this point we had already been here for an hour so he ate his bacon cheeseburger with some kind of sauce he specifically said he did not want. At this point the only decent thing to happen was a Pepsi but I could never get a refill until 10 minutes before we left. Oh yeah, my husband's fries didn't get served when he received his cheeseburger, they came out some time later. When we were able to interact with Stella it was with one word answers/comments from her...yes, sorry, odd looks etc. My son summed it up nicely by saying you can't expect much from a restaurant that's equivalent to a Walmart. I don't shop at Walmart and I'll never eat at Applebee's again.  To be fair I'll say the manager gave us 25% off all 3 dinner orders but I'd much rather have paid full price for great service even though the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I ate here 8/5/2014.It was a Tuesday, the second Tuesday in a row. As far as Applebee's go this location is my favorite. I am not normally a fan of this chain but they tend to have good food for the value. This location however is So Cool. So Tuesday July 30th my daughter wanted to come here for her birthday. We tried to make other suggestions but this is where she wanted to go. We met Jamie a manager here. She was so fun and invited us back the following week when they were having a Disney dress up day with the staff. Tuesday being kids night we were happy to return. They have the best balloon guy I have ever seen. He is just amazing.  Disney Tuesday was so much fun. Jamie played the evil queen and had my kids cracking up.   The food was wonderful and for the second week in a row the service was perfect. My kids no longer ask to go to chuck e cheese and we have a great meal at a great value. Thank You Jamie for making this restaurant a fun experience, not just a place to eat."}
{"text":"As we first walked into the restaurant, the hostess was having a sidebar conversation with someone, even though seeing us, continued the conversation until finished, then gave us a giant fake smile.. felt like I was on some prank TV show.  When she sat us down, our server came by and asked for drinks when we just barely sat down, haven't even looked at the menu yet so just ordered water.     During the time my mother and I waited for our meal, we could hear the female bartender having a conversation with one of the guests of how she loves to party, doesn't know who her daughters father is and how she hates getting low tips from customers.  Her and the guest were flirty and the entire conversation was entirely inappropriate.    Our meal finally came, by the manager himself, not our actual server.  The manager did NOT carry a tray for our food, he had each hand with a plate. As he was putting my mothers meal on the table, he stuck his thumb in her hamburger as he was setting the plate down.. EEEWWW!!!! Then he sat my plate down, all of my meal looked dried out, and it tasted like it too.  I asked the manager for lemon slices before he left so I can add it to my water (ended up using it on the food instead).   A few minutes went by and the server came by and asked us how our meal was, I said \"It's just ok.\" As it was. He didn't ask why it was just ok, he just walked away and left. Once our meals were done, he gave us a check, had the card sitting on it to have it taken and took forever to get out of there.  Then my mom asked about the hamburger she ordered to go, if we will be getting it anytime soon... he forgot it, figures. Will NEVER come back there and would never recommend. If I wanted IHOP service, I would have just gone to IHOP."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this joint but after the menu change, no thanks! No happy hours wing and the service is crappy. Go out of business and let Chili's take over."}
{"text":"I used to work for this company. And I worked at this location. We were celebrating my nephews birthday, a party of 8. All of our food was cold and disgusting. My son and I sent our meals back and they came back just as bad. After an experience like this, you would expect at least one manager to stop by.....but not a single one did. Our server Melissa was amazing and attentive to our needs, however she was put in a bad position because the food was horrendous and the management didn't seem to care. Very unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now , love the food and the service. One of my reasons for writing this review not to put down or make look bad. I came with my family a couple of weeks , this time the service was akward.... the girl in the front or the greeter was dancing around I was ok , she sat as down didn't say anything just left our menus and walked away. OK, we are a bit hungry no one came to our table for at least 30 minutes. My wife kept saying why all the waiters just passing us by. There was one girl that kept looking at us but didn't bother to ask if we have been served. They kept pointing at our table I guess they figured out no one was working on our table. Well ,the funny part was they knew because the waitress ( Apolonia ) she commented \" Oh ! the invisible table ja ja... so I just stared at her like REALLY !...  Management should not over look at this small things , it makes your restaurants look bad. Oh by the way , I left an invisible Tip ..."}
{"text":"We ordered off the lunch menu.  The chicken tacos were very good, the bourbon st chicken and shrimp not so much.  The food seemed over cooked.  The service was mediocre.  The waitress was very dingy."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy visits to this Applebee's but not yesterday. The host and server were nice. Took a little long for our food and brought wrong meal by mistake. As I had the soup and salad,  was easy fix. This is where the pleasant visit goes horribly wrong.  One bite of soup, ok, not bad. Take first bite of salad and almost gagged. Pulled a long black hair out of my mouth. If you've seen my other review,  ( Wendy's) apparently I should stop ordering salads altogether. We looked around for several minutes but no one, I mean absolutely no servers were on the floor. My husband actually had to go find the person that seated us. Server came over, offered to remake but I had no appetite whatsoever. From that point forward, she would not look us in the eye. I felt bad as I wasn't blaming her at all and like I said, she was nice. Soon, manager came over and apologized and said she'd get to bottom of it. I didn't see check as I left sooner than husband but was assured my meal was removed from bill."}
{"text":"I was a bit worried to go to this location because of the other reviews about the slow and bad service. The service was fine and timely. Just what you would expect at any Applebees, average tasting food at average prices and average service. I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Service is top notch here. I never had a problem with their waiters. Food is good too. I love their spinach dip and chips."}
{"text":"Every person in restaurant today had food issues. Staff just kept saying 'health inspection prep' was messing up orders. I call BS. Worse experience at any Applebee's we've ever been to.   But I have a feeling it isn't JUST the kitchens fault..."}
{"text":"Came around 5pm on a Saturday. Took our orders promptly. Asked for no ice but ofcourse I got ice. Appetizer was delivered in 10 min and was good. However we ordered double crunch shrimp which we were told after we placed the other that it wasn't available. The other entree was chicken bourbon and shrimp which included 5 small shrimps and an undercooked chicken breast which was sent back but they did give me a whole new entree."}
{"text":"Closest location to my home. So my family and I go to this one pretty often. We've never had an issue, staff is always attentive here. I remember we even left my son's backpack in the booth one day. We realized weeks later that the bag was there, we called and with no issues the manager let us know they it was still in their lost and found. Easily one of my favorite locations"}
{"text":"Ok. We come here quite often....and see the same ppl (workers  I mean) NO attempt to say to us--- hello again, nice to see your back..nothing.  I normally tip well, just because it's part of my nature being a part of the service industry for so long.  But this chain, especially this location and Howe Ave really need to get it together.  The service tonite was awful. First of all, they had a new waitress training. I've worked in my share of restaurants,  and the  \"Normal\" policy is for the new server to shadow the trainer. For them to learn the ropes. They usually come around and tell the customers this is....so and so..and they will be training tonite.  Nope. Not like that at all. She introduced herself, and the lack of service began.  I don't want to draw this out, but come on ppl....show some class and at least act like you guys have a clue!!!!! We were there for almost 2 hours!!!!! I kid you not.  A 3 top....., 2 for $20...with boneless wings and another order.  Yes. Almost 2 hours later we finally checked out. I just don't get it.  This location about a year and a half ago used to be so fun to go to. The servers rembrd you and were attentive. ...now they can really care less. And the food!!! Literally in the past 3 weeks we've gone, they haven't had what I normally order. (Lemon grilled chicken with the quinoa/rice )...tonite it came out smaller than ever....the rice they gave me extended past my little chicken breast maybe an inch.  So cheap. It isn't even all quinoa. But mostly rice.  Whatver. I'm  just so done.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to wait tables. But with the staff they have here now.....apparently it does.  And I'm writing corporate about them. Because we choose to go here to spend money. Every single week. The least we can get is good service and the food we order. Smh. ...."}
{"text":"Food was way over salted to the point it was impossible to eat. Going back to Chili's"}
{"text":"My husband and i recently started coming back to applebees after giving them a 5 year break and heres what weve noticed.  1. The service has been slow EVERYTIME weve gone (4 times in the last few months) 2. The decor is the same dated look and needs to be revamped. 3. The servers get confused and are inconsistent each time about the soup being unlimited if its by itself. Half the time yes and the other half no... 4. They have the BEST french onion soup which is the main reason i keep coming back."}
{"text":"The overall environment was good, but the service was bad. the servant took my plate before i finish. the lemon chicken tasted like a sponge socked in lemon. with the flat taste rice."}
{"text":"It's official, Applebee's has really gone down hill. It doesn't matter what part of the country I go they are just not what they used to be. For starters, they changed the menu several times, making the portions smaller and smaller every time. The quality is not what it was once upon a time. We order our classic spinach and artichoke did and boneless chicken. The chicken was cold when it arrived, and the size of the spinach dip was half of what it used to be. The service was great, the bartender waited on our table during reverse happy hour, he was attentive and prompt. It is not his fault for the screw ups in the kitchen. Our mixed drinks were about the only thing that was good about our meal. The perfect margarita was perfect (considering others always screwed up in Easton, MD) I didn't have to question the bartender on what he added he followed the recipe to the T. Hopefully Applebee's corporate management gets their act together and get the menu back to what it was once."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because of their Carside-to-go option. It always sounds like a good idea because of how convenient it sounds; however, they always manage to do something wrong every single time I go. This means forgetting menu items, not including sauce or dressing, and inconsistent portions."}
{"text":"I grew up with Applebee's back home. It was one of the first chains outside of Eat'n Park I went to in a regular occasion. I don't get here as much as I used to by any means, but as of late we've been using their Carside to go, so my review is for this service.  Three main reasons I've gone back twice: the price, the service, the promptness.  Applebee's, like most chain restaurants have done a good job over the years to keep their prices down with $10 meals and 2 for $20 offerings. Every time we come here I feel that we got a good deal.  Using Carside to go has been a pleasant experience. They seem to put some of their best employees working this section and they've all been incredibly nice. Even better, they focus on your food being exactly ready at the time you selected. That way when you get home it's as fresh as it can possibly be.  I'd recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying I go there about once a week.  I hear (yelp) people complain about their food being slightly off.  They do a huge business there and things can happen as at any restaurant.  If I or my friends ever have a problem with something we just ask and they remake it for us.  No problem.  They are always courteous, fast and the food is great.  Have some patience folks and enjoy your meal.  If you don't tell them, they surely can't fix it."}
{"text":"Major improvement on menu.  Very clean.  I love that they have tablets on tables to expedite service. The staff at this location are very attentive. The management team went above and beyond to quickly solve a minor dining issue. I will for sure be coming back and I recommend you to try it!!!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to find food worse than what now Applebee's offer. Used to be great, but horrible now."}
{"text":"And the lack luster staff and food are the reasons why I have not been back in years and probably won't come back again. Waitress asked me if I liked my steak bloody instead of using proper terminology. The bartender keeps touching her hair and then the glasses and people's drinks. I think that might be a health dept code violation in some states.  Update: so I lied. I'm back again bc the kid likes the cheese factor. Newer bartender - at least she's not touching her hair and face. Waitress looked more experienced than the last one. They've been more attentive bc I have the YELP app open."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a couple of locations and this one is the best. The food is fresh and the service friendly. I usually go with my wife and we have both liked everything we've ordered. We do the either 2 for $20 or 2 for $25. I also like doing just appetizers and they have a nice selection, but it would be better if they all of the appetizers for that option."}
{"text":"Worse place ever on top of the food being bad, and the server not on top of the ball, the manager at night was just as bad. this has got to be the worse establishment ever... Started of great got sat down quick took a while to get drinks, when appetizers came out they were cold ask if they can just throw them in the microwave the waitress gave a attitude... When done with the meal we paid and were about to leave when we were so quickly to get blamed for not paying the bill wtf the manager came out very inappropriate when I asked kindly that his actions were rude all he did was blame the server and the server need to be retrain blaming for no pay when we said we paid twice inside the restaurant... After all said I told the manager he need a attitude change because that's no way to treat PAYING customers.... He quickly said I can act and say whatever I like honestly this restaurant is garbage and I will never come back"}
{"text":"This Applebee's is always on top of there game every single time I have come here they always seem to do everything right... The servers are always on top of there jobs drinks refilled before I have to ask for another one.. Food always hot and ready to eat, and they are always friendly. I'm happy to say that it is always a amazing experience every time I come. Not to mention the manager is always walking around checking up on things. I will continue coming to this Applebee's only because I appreciate that they try, unlike all the others I have gone to. Especially as a server I always appreciate the little things."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this place. This has been our family restaurant since it's been opened. Was waiting to order for 18 mins, tried to get our waiters attention every time he passed. Finally came to our table at 6:08 & my mother said we would like to order from the happy hour menu. Our waiter who was an older gentleman aged  50-60 turned to my mother and blatantly told her No. it was passed 6 o clock and if you don't like it you can speak to my manager. Are you kidding me!?? What terrible customer service!!! Not I'm sorry you're past the time even if we had been waiting there 18 mins! Than the manager came over basically calling me a liar that I haven't been there that long...I even showed him the time I texted my mother I was here and she was right around the corner at 5:45!! Disgusted!!! Manager told us no at first and than said maybe I can manually do it.. I've worked for this Applebee's before & I've been coming here for decades & to be treated like they could give a shit about their customers is beyond me... not to worry I will have no problem driving 20 mins out of my way to be treated with respect. It's not the fact of saving money for happy hour, like what's the big deal just pay full price?? It's the fact that we as your customers pay your bills. I notice when my server is  having a bad day but they still try & I give them the benefit of the doubt but to treat my mother and I like that is disgusting. Chao Applebee's on Nellie and Stewart! You don't deserve any stars at this point but yelp makes at least pick one.."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Triple Pork Dare Ya sandwich. Looked NOTHING like the picture (but do they ever?). Left off the bacon and pulled pork, so I had not triple, but single dare ya. Couldn't believe it!!  Complained, then they brought the pulled pork on a separate dish. Still no bacon. And the pork looked like it had already been eaten. Anyhow, sent it back, ordered appetizers to go, got the hell outta there. Will NOT return."}
{"text":"You literally couldn't pay me to go here ever again. Which is sad because when I was young my Dad and I loved to go here. However, things have changed and standards seem to be much lower.  In short, the service was slow and the food was disgusting. The chicken was rubbery and the mashed potatoes were freezer burned...it was like eating cafeteria food only more expensive lol!  0/10 would never ever recommend."}
{"text":"I have a few food allergies and so eating out is always an experience. However, the waitress was so kind and got the manager to take care of the food for me. They both asked for items to look out for when cooking the food and made sure that every contaminant was kept out of my food. It was amazing!  The food on the other had...I've had better, but it was nice to see how out of their way they would go to help a customer. A++ Customer Service! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food is alright and the atmosphere is okay as well. Went with several bridesmaids and we had a good time, but the waiter messed up our tickets by putting everyone's order all in one so we had to wait another 20 minutes for him to figure out how to break them apart.  Not necessarily my first choice but I still think they have good lunch and early dinner specials."}
{"text":"When it's busy, it can get crowded. But they have great deals throughout the week and even for lunch and dinner. I like their riblets are pretty good."}
{"text":"I left a pair of my sunglasses on the table because I was gathering all of my 5 month olds stuff up. I understand it was my fault I didn't pay much attention and I had to call back later to ask for them back. (The only people that would have touched the table after I left would be the waitress picking up her tip or the busser cleaning the table up). The manager Kenny then told me that they weren't there. I work in customer service too and people leave things in my store all the time and come back looking for them, we on the other hand actually give the items back instead of letting our employees keep them. Sure, I left them on the table but I didn't think that makes them fair game for the employees to keep!!!!!   I called twice and \"Kenny\" was not helpful at all. He let me know when I asked for corporates phone # that he didn't think they would do anything for me then spit the # at me as fast as he could then hung up. I will definitely be calling. And posting this review everywhere I can."}
{"text":"DJ at the bar was so awesome. She never stops and is constantly going. She works hard and gave us wonderful customer service"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stay far away feom this Applebees. I ordered a Pepsi and it was flat. The server got me another one, but stated that their soda is always flat and she won't even drink it. We got the beer cheese and pretzels for an appetizer and received dried up cheese (microwaved) and there was seriously only enough cheese to cover the bottom of the bowl. I sent it back only to receive a second bowl that was watered down and more like soup. When our dinner arrived the middle was hot and around the edges were cold. (It was pasta) and probably microwaved as well. I took mine home so I could heat it at home. I'm never going hack to this place. It is horrible!"}
{"text":"Hadn't gone there in years, had a horrible server, she never stopped by our table, took over an hour to receive our food, and out appetizer came out after our food. our date night was horrible, and I had to seek out the manager who pulled me aside so I could talk to her, the manager was super sweet and understanding. now we normally aren't complainers, and our food was on point, but the serve staff needs to get their shit together"}
{"text":"Today - Went to Applebee's on N. Prospect Ave. for lunch. Wasn't too busy. Our waitress was Andretta (sp?).  She was trying to train a new server. She took our order. I ordered the 6oz steak (medium well), it came out Well done. I told her that it was over done, she picked up my plate and looked at it in the light like i was lying. She looked at me and said yes it was over done and she'd get a new one.  Few minutes later the manager came out with a new steak, this time it was raw and asked him if it could be put on longer and he did. (real nice guy).. Comes back out and it was over done 'smh', I went ahead and took it as it was. The \"waitress\" came back over after i had to wave her down,  and told her that the sides, was not replaced when they cooked the steak. (they was cold). She argued and told me she threw away the first round and watched them put new on the plate which was a lie cause she was out on the floor while it was getting done and it was the same sides as first came out. She went back to the back and told the manager it was cold, because the manager came out with steaming hot sides which wasn't the case earlier. I don't appreciate. being basically told that it's my imagination that something was cold. She acted like there was never anything wrong with my meal.. I thank the manager who made my meal at least warm enough to eat. Never had this issue at the one in Savoy. That's going to be the one I go to from now on if I want Applebee's."}
{"text":"On 9/8/15 ordered via curbside and when I arrived for my pick-up meal. I waited for about ten minutes for me to stop a waitress and tell her that I am here for a pick-up. When I walk in the door the night manager Ken walk around for several minutes and look at me and ignored my presence. I watch him walk around for ten minutes talking to the bartender laughing and smiling while ignoring me as I stood there patiently waiting for someone to retrieve my order. Horrible service. The manager was rude and should not be working in customer service."}
{"text":"Good service. The food however was just blah. I definitely don't recommend the Quesadilla burger."}
{"text":"IDK about this place. Hit and miss I guess.  The server was very nice which is always a plus. I had the lemon chicken meal which was nice. It had a very lemon flavor but nice. Now the cheese cake shot was crap. Very grainy and I was very disappointed it that."}
{"text":"A typical franchised Applebee's. The buffalo wing appetizers were good and blue moon on tap! Friendly waitress and staff."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the following things at applebees:  Wedge Salad Beer Mozz Sticks   That's about it. I always sit at the bar, so I don't know what it's like to hang out in the regular seating with all the children, but I can tell you that the bar area is nice, the bartenders have always been helpful and they have super reasonably priced beer.  The parking lot is being remodeled for the entire center so parking can be a real pain if you go in around lunch or dinner time because the lot is 1/3 the size of what it used to be, but still has all the traffic for all of the open businesses.  Anyway, it's a fun place to go to hang out and chat with friends, eat some alright food and drink good beer."}
{"text":"Considering the options available in uptown, specifically this part of uptown, why on earth would one go here? There isn't enough room to list all of the great places within walking distance of this Applebee's. St Francis, Federal Pizza, Windsor, Joyride, Postino, Huss Brewing, Sauce, Shake Shack, Sun Up Brewing, 2 Hippies, etc. This isn't even considering 7th St or 7th Ave. People, stop going here and hopefully it goes away and will be replaced by yet another great place."}
{"text":"I keep going back here to give them one more try, despite my wife saying she's had it with this restaurant.  After this latest visit, I guess I'll have to give in to her wishes.  We've had both good and bad dinners here, but lately they seem to be consistently mediocre or worse.  The chicken with portabello mushrooms was amazingly tasteless.  My wife's fries, accompanying her shrimp dinner, were stiff and unappetizing.  The waitress, friendly enough when she showed up, either wasn't trained properly to clear plates promptly or just didn't care.  The appetizer was late, so much so that it arrived only minutes before the main dishes ...we had just started into it.  I wondered to my eating companions if they understood the purpose of appetizers.  I know Applebees in other areas have been better ... so I blame this one on it's manager.  The wife wins this one ... we won't be back."}
{"text":"When you say medium rare you expect a little pink. I think shoe leather would have been easier to chew than the piece of meat I got.  The service took forever so the steak was probably cooking for the full 45 minutes.  Silverware was filthy as well. Somebody needs to step thing up or they won't last long. Unfortunately I see they've got a lot of 1 star reviews. Wish I'd looked before assuming Applebee's was a safe choice."}
{"text":"To the manager of this location:  Please do something about the panhandlers at your location.  I went to your location yesterday for lunch and there was a guy sitting out front with his bag of belongings next to him looking either very stoned or drunk ... Barefoot and begging for money when I went into the restaurant.  I said something to my server when I went inside so I figured it would be taken care of.  So guess what as I was leaving the restaurant he was still in the exact same spot within 5 or 10 feet of your front door just sitting there all stoned looking..."}
{"text":"So sick of WAITING while tables sit empty & the \"cutsie\" little greeter girls act like they are working. No idea of organization or time management. Used to love this one but not anymore.  After waiting, kids meals came when we were done eating and they were stone cold!  The one manager is very condescending & could care less.  Could be a major reason this Applebee's is going downhill.  I'll be happy to drive to north Scottsdale or even Elliot. They both have more responsible employees & managers that care."}
{"text":"This had always been my favorite Applebee's. Consistently good perfect margaritas, quick seating, great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite restaurant.  But over the past few months the service has really been lacking.  Kitchen food coming out late, going up to bar getting our own drinks, and items missing from plates.. just a real unpleasant visit.  We come every week for the last three years and have told family and friends how good the service was.... but know I will warn them to stay away!!!!   Montee Ball Sr"}
{"text":"Applebees is one of my favorite restaurants ever, I always get the chicken and shrimp bourbon street we'll never been to this location and unfortunately I don't think Ill ever go back to applebees again... spent $50+ to get food poisoning.... absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Waited almost 20 minutes ro have our order taken. Then it took another 30 minutes to get our food. When it finally arrived, the steak was overcooked and dry and the side dishes were cold. Almost like they were sitting under a heat lamp. We didn't feel like waiting for replacememts so we asked to have the items removed from our ticket. That request took another 20 minutes. The manager was busy walking around talking to employees instead of taking care of the customers. Our server asked the manager twice to adjust our ticket and she ignored it. She didn't even bother asking us what was wrong or how it can be improved. Doubt we'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience here. Our waitress never spoke to us until the food came and when it did it was overcooked and dry. The ribs had no meat on them at all. I like Applebee's, but this was terrible."}
{"text":"I'm usually quite happy with this Applebee's but today was a complete different story. I've been going to this Applebee's for years, today I wanted to go and enjoy a dinner but what I got wasn't what I expected it to be.  the hostess from the start wasn't pleasant. says it'll be twenty minutes until were seated. as time goes we're waiting. now 30 almost 40 minutes into our wait, were seeing people barely walk in and be seated right away. now with frustration I walk up to the hostess stand and see that my name has been crossed off. as I'm looking the hostess come back with attitude and say \"um, can I help you?\" I said no, you've crossed our names off and left. I know I won't be back do awhile. specially after tonight. not your best Applebee's. not your best."}
{"text":"I don't like writing this, because Wife and I have been going to this Applebee's (44th Street and Thomas Road in Phoenix, AZ) since it opened. Came to know a number of servers more or less personally over the years; always had decent service, and the food -- while not exactly gourmet quality -- was at least serviceable and tasty.   The most recent manager there that we knew was Neill Courtney. Ran a tight ship: the place was spotless, food was really good (even with the B Team in the kitchen), service was great. Then Neill left last November, got married, and went back to the UK to open his own pub.   A month later, Applebee's had deteriorated. Carpets were messy, men's restroom needed cleaning, food was inferior, service was spotty. Manager was chatty, though, and acknowledged that Things Would Be Done.   We decided this evening (1/18/18) to give it another try. Bad move. First, the server got Wife's order wrong, and brought the higher priced item. When she pointed this out to him, he blamed her; said we'd have to pay full price anyway. Strike One.   We asked to speak to the manager; he never showed. Strike Two. (To be fair, the bill was slightly -- very slightly -- adjusted later.)   I ordered the Steak and Grains, a favorite that's usually served with a little light gravy. What I was served was close to steak soup; all the ingredients swimming about loosely in a gravy pond. Strike Three.   Finally, I ordered coffee. They served the coffee and a knife. A KNIFE?? The server said, \"That's your stirrer,\" and walked off. There's no Strike Four, but there should be.   That's the end of Applebee's at this location, as far as we're concerned. There are a whole bunch of interesting new restaurants recently opened in the area. I'm sure they'll be just as happy to take our dollars.  PS: Marcus, formerly a server and now a bartender, is the one bright spot. He's great, as always."}
{"text":"My steak came out a bit over cooked, but I never complaint... our server Sarah seen that I wasn't really touching my meat ;) so she knew I wasn't happy with it, she addressed it to the manager named harry... and fixed it!!! Way to go guys... our nice dinner was saved."}
{"text":"After just visiting Applebee's I remembered why I hadn't been there in five years or so. It's just not very good.  We enjoyed the appetizer well enough, but the waitress told us that appetizers were supposed to be half off. We thought that was great and ordered it for that reason, but when we got the bill they charged us for the full price of it. What a ripoff!   The caesar salad was abysmal. I have seldom had worse. How do you mess up salad? The pasta entree we got was also not very good and oddly enough when I heated it up leftover it was much better.   At least Applebee's is open later than most places. Not that it matters since the food isn't worth the price.  Get your act together Applebee's! It may be awhile before I am willing to give you another chance."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here, from over-inquisitive hostesses looking for details from my personal life in our 20 second walk from her post to our table,  to rude broken English servers who sound like they're swearing at me when they talk.  I've had some good experiences, but chain places should accommodate everyone and servers should not zealously push you to drink alcohol to get their tip higher.  Rude!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this particular Applebees to anyone. Me and my family ordered food. My cousin and I ordered pasta and it was supposed to come with bread. They forgot that. Finished our pasta and still no bread. Also our appetizers were chips and salsa along with some spinach dip. They brought out a small plate knowing there were six of us. How were we going to eat the chips and dip? Pour the dip in our hands and dip the chip into our palm? My cousins wife's drink was done sort of Sangria with cranberry in it. She took one sip and realized how disgusting it was. The floor manager nor two orlther waitresses noticed we were missing more plates, bread for the pasta and that the big sangria drink was still full. This was a slow Sunday night by the way. It was barely even busy. I would not recommend this place. Perhaps Chilis or another similar type restaurant or different Applebees would be your best bet."}
{"text":"We went to eat here on a Wednesday night. Kind of crowded, but still we were seated within about 10 minutes (party of 2).  We were seated, then we waited.. and waited. Finally another waiter came to take our drink and food order, he said the assigned waiter was too busy. We gave him our non-complicated order: appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks. Our assigned waiter finally came around, oblivious to the fact that someone else already took our order.  Food came out fairly quickly, could have been a bit faster. Our assigned waiter brought out our entrees - no appetizer. I was a bit frustrated, but we began to ate our meals anyway. After awhile I think our waiter know how irritated we were, so the manager came by. The manager apologized (which was great), ordered our appetizer and brought it out immediately and offered us a dessert - all on the house!  I was very impressed with their ability to sense a problem and quickly correct it. For that, I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Typically Applebees. Friendly service however if you order bar drinks it usually takes a while. I love their lunch specials and the 2 for $20 or $25."}
{"text":"We enjoyed another great lunch today. We had he three cheese chicken penne. We had the chicken appetizers. The service was great , and do was the food."}
{"text":"Slow as hell.  I'm sure we were forgotten about as people behind came and went.  Finally complained.  They still wouldn't cop to forgetting us.  How long could it take to make a sandwich and a couple of salads.  And no it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Hmm yeah 2 is strictly pulling off the well customer service of one of the waitresses.   Today I and my family took a walk and dad decided he wanted to stop and get a burger. When arriving in apple bees I was shocked to see what appeared to be two teens or younger girls laughing and giggling and gossiping other then attending to the door. After 5 mins I grew aggravated and asked the curly head one to get the manager. When I asked she replied by saying oh it will be a while he's to busy, and started laughing with the other girl again. At this point another lady sitting with a newborn had explained she had been waiting a half hour for a meal she placed an order for online and it said it had been done. 2 mins later the manger appears and i explain that I think it's very unprofessional to how the guest where not treated he apologized and began to seat us, when he first attempted to seat us at a booth it was a mass amount of food that has been pushed under the table I asked for another booth next to it. The two girls continued to gossip and I pointed it out to the manager. He then disappeared. The lady that had served our table was actually very pleasant and cheerful which is the only reason we even stayed to order. Through the course of us eating I saw the two girls continue to tail behind each other. Which would be perfectly fine if it was not during happy hour when customers are actually attempting to order and be served."}
{"text":"What can I say about Applebee's?  It's an American chain restaurant.  Food options are standard fare.  Their Spinach & Artichoke Dip is what had me coming here back in the day but now my palate has matured.  REALLY nice servers tho.  The Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae is the best thing I've had here; albeit overpriced in comparison to similar desserts around town."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding Applebee's for awhile now because of bad food but since every place in the area was closed after watching a movie I thought I'll give this place another chance. I ordered the sizzling shrimp and broccoli plate. It looked like a TV dinner, not appetizing at all. It was too sweet and the vegetables were over cooked. The only good thing about our visit tonight was the fast service which might be because they were about to close. I understand so not a big deal. I just hope that they will revisit their menu and make a dramatic improvement. Sorry I won't be back soon. Another thing, the rice was undercooked. It was bad. The visit was a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Typical Food Chain Restaurant  Saw the riblets and fries commercial over and over again while watching Sunday football, so the wife and I thought why not give it try. Our service was GREAT, the food was good, and our mix drinks were good too."}
{"text":"Emancipation  A bad apple spoils the bunch. Well, at this apple we had a great lunch!   Seems that a lot of people think that the quality of the food at applebee's is not as good as other restaurants to the point that when they're reviewing a restaurants they didn't like, they  always say that the quality of the food was as bad as that of an applebees....STOP THAT! LEAVE APPLEBEE'S ALONE! Well, not really; You have to try the asiago pepper  corn  sirloin steak Served with steamed Herb potatoes and vegetables. wow! Is as good as any Delmonico's steak! ( :-) ) also you should try the grilled Dijon chicken & portobellos!  Mmmm as good as Mon Ami Gabi ( :-) ) ....I know; apples and oranges but that's my point.   service was great, waiter (Alex) was friendly and food brought to us in a timely manner. Drink refilled constantly and waiter checked on us one too many times.   This is a family restaurant but it has a full bar and they show most of the games, we got to watch soccer when I was there, couldn't be at a better timing! The place is very spacious and very clean, good for big families. And the best part! You pay Applebee's prices for (your favorite restaurant here) quality food. Usually you get what you pay for, but in this case you'll get more apples per pound. They also have the meal deal for two for twenty dollars! Wow! you can't even find that at your local supermarket.                                                                                                                      Now you know!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant I thought until tonight I was asked by the Gentleman at the door booth or table ? No eye contact know good evening Welcome, just RUDE then I'm hoping it wasn't the color of my skin I was seated in a booth Closer to the rest room . It felt as it was segregation all over again! I two booths away from the rest room Colors on one side greeter acting as if blacks should not have walked in . I just sat there and paid attention how he interacted with other Race that enter apple bee's . Our waitress was Jennifer G she had a better attitude then him even with me having a slight attitude towards her. Jennifer remained professionally well manner and continue her job well . If employees going to treat blacks as if we are ROSE Parker's and sit in the back of APPLE BEE'S begin disrespected then this one restaurant that should close are TERMINATE your Racist's employees STARTING WITH YOUR GREETER that was at the door around 5pm on 01/17/2016"}
{"text":"Came here to watch Monday night football and grab a decent dinner which we did.  Unfortunately service was horrible for some reason and I'm sure we may of been the only party feeling this way . First for starters I feel a server should offer introduction on first in counter which did not happen with us or any other tables he sat afterward . Next our appetizer came out with our main meal which was awkward because I'm sure fried green beans don't take as long as a burger. Someone else brought out the food never seen our waiter until check time he literally walked past our table seven times asking all tables were they ok except ours not mention tables that were all seated after our arrival. So after being there looking at an empty plate for 20+ minutes he brings me a refill which he spills all over my napkin never brings napkins to replace . On top of that my refill on fries were not what was ordered originally .  Manager not too attentive being that she brought our drinks out as well as our desserts but never once ask how we were doing"}

{"text":"Worst Customer Service and Food ever! If it wasn't for the gift card I would have walked out on my bill seriously!!!!! So terrible! My drink tasted like water, food came out with my appetizers and my waitress not only didn't put in my drink order but also tried to mess with our bill. Goodbye!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I ordered the \"brisket stuffed enchiladas\". They looked like enchiladas you might find in the frozen food section of Goant Eagle or Costco. And they were microwaved into a cheesy stain on the plate. $11.99 The appetizer, the mini tacos were okay.   But it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive and what a disappointment.   It didn't look anything like the menu pic. Not even close.   My wife had the sirloin. It was a far better choice.  But the total tab was over $50.00.   Thank god we had a gift card or I would have been pissed."}
{"text":"Great service! people are real friendly. Always have my drink filled  Great music in background Plenty of TV to watch games Management looks like they are involved and helping"}
{"text":"This place has lousy reviews but we tried it anyway  The food was great the service was was polite and friendly  Did not have any problems, will return when in the area"}
{"text":"Service was okay. My sizzling skillet did not sizzle at all...I notified the server and things were fixed, skillet still wasn't doing much but whatever. The appetizers are better than the entrees in my opinion. I use to work for Applebee's at a different location in PA.. So I know what to expect on a trip to the bees! Gotta love the margarita though..."}
{"text":"Karl was such a nice server. My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful experience thanks to Karl!"}
{"text":"This Applebees is hella chill. Came here to get drinks and I was really impressed. Will definitely come here again to drink again."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money at this Applebee's. They have terrible service & the food is not up to par by any means. When my plate came to the table ( I ordered to steak & shrimp) I got a horrible wiff of a terrible smell ( I thought the lady at the next table passed gas). The smell wasn't going away so I cut my steak & smelled it & nearly threw up. It smelled rotten. I asked the mgr to take the meal off my tab & he rudely stated that \"it is just the Parmesan\". No it wasn't. By the time we finally got our server back by our table for the check, she dropped it off and disappeared again. We tried asking another server to cash us out, and she wasn't able to. So we practically left exact change on the table after another 10 mins of waiting & left. I have friends that have had similar experiences. Will never go back to this place again, never ever."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday afternoon because it's never crowded and we never have to wait at Applebees.  We ordered the 3 for $20.00 which is a choice of pre selected appetizers and entrees.   We chose the Queso dip, steak dinner and chicken penne dinner.  The Queso was really good and so were the chips that came with it.  However, we waited entirely too long for the entree to come out..  I was very hungry and that may be why it felt so long but it felt like forever.  we were done with the appetizer for a long time before our meals came out.  My husband loved his steak.  I tried it and I have to admit it wasn't bad.  My chicken penne pasta was awful.  I think there may have been three strips of chicken in it and the rest was a serving bowl full of penne pasta that was dry.  I ate as much of it that I could but when I was done it didn't look like I had even touched it.  Way too long of a wait for some bland mac n cheese!!"}
{"text":"Went to Applebee's tonight with my family and it lower my rating with Applebee's.   My impression with Applebee's food is not that great, until their recent menu update. I was actually impressed when I visit the Monroeville location a couple weeks ago. However, tonight was a different story, food was okay. Definitely not something I would return for.   After we put in our order tonight, we thought we should also get an appetizer, so we browse through the kiosk/tablet on the table and ordered the Kobe style meatball. It had a gorgeous picture, while I do understand the photo are taken by a profession and the real food are usually not comparable, but when we receive our appetizer, it was ugly!!! My first moment of thought was, is that what I ordered? Looks so much different, even the portion was cut in half. The photo shows a full size ciabatta bread while I only see half on my plate. Hmmm. Fortunately it taste better than it looked.   For our entrees, we ordered a steak, Baby Back Ribs, and a Chicken entree. They all tasted decent with the exception of the steak. It's not firm like a real steak, it's actually tender but in a weird way. Not sure what kind of steak they use, but we've never had a steak like that. We returned it and got a chicken dish instead.   Overall, the food is just okay, not something I would return for. Expect more when I dine in at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I would always go on Friday for bone in hot wings and a cold beer.  They changed their wings to breaded and raised the price.  I sorry but they are nasty.  I don't know why these companies keep changing a basic item like wings, I guess they are looking for new customers...it's just dumb to turn your back on the ones you already have. If i wanted something different I would have gone somewhere else now you are forcing me to.  My wife would always go with me so they lost two customers just not one.  I think with tip I would spend about $2000 a year. Dumb dumb dumb.  At least I don't have to listen to my wife bitch about dirty silverware anymore."}
{"text":"Applebees has gone down hill. Well at least this one. Service was ok. But the food sucked. Which sucks because I used to love this spot. My glass of water had a bunch of gross stuff floating in it. The spinach dip had a weird taste. My daughters yogurt from the kids menu tasted sour. My wife's ribs tasted bitter. It was just all bad unfortunately. If they cook their food better, than all would be well."}
{"text":"Go to Outback Steakhouse, it's just down the street and the service and food are way better."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant dinner.  Ordered steak and it came out promptly and cooked to perfection.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I've never had to write a one-star review over 200 reviews never once I always find one thing that I like about her place even if the food was bad or the service was horrible there's always one thing that can make positive not here used to come here a long time ago the food was always okay Services alright but never nothing great now and there was nothing sometime you walked in the door with the hostess with the attitude and playing on the phone to the server never coming back to the table feel drinks just to bring the order to the unedible hamburger not sure how you messed that up meat and cheese no lettuce no tomato no onions when it clearly says on the menu can't find server to bring back to you ask for medium get well well done wife had the steak salad can I eat the steak cuz it was so chewy and tough dressing was horribly tasting even the bathrooms are filthy I guess that's why this place was empty at happy hour when they used to be packed before I wouldn't definitely tell everyone to stay away because I am"}
{"text":"I don't know how we ended up here, but I will not be back.  Probably to any Applebee's honestly.  So incredibly greasy, so incredibly expensive!!! I know right?   Skip it, there has to be somewhere else."}
{"text":"Poor service. The wait staff was inconsiderate during Thanksgiving. We waited 20 minutes before we were told to wait even longer. We just left at that point."}
{"text":"Big decision to go to Applebee's tonight... Family of five walked in.. no one at the door, bartender at his register, (no one at the bar), Host with her purse over her shoulder poked her head around the corner and went back.  After a few minutes and not being acknowledged or not being greeted we decided to leave and eat somewhere else! Greatly disappointed but not surprised. Too many options in the area to start off like that."}
{"text":"I don't have any problems when I go to Applebee's usually .But we went there today for Mother's Day it took us about a half an hour to get drinks and about two hours to get food I ordered the two for 22 my daughter and I Got the 6 ounce steak mix vegetables and a baked potato, the steak was way over done , One of my kids got chicken and french fries and the other one ordered steak and french fries, the steak and french fries for the kids was  burnt he could not even eat it it was that Burnt.I asked for medium well and they burned it .I complained as soon as I got it the manager came over and looked at it and said yes it is over done would you like something else I said no I'm not going to wait Another two hours so she took my meal And the kids steak off the bill. Thank you."}
{"text":"The food here is great every time I have came here to eat it has been a great expletive with good costumer service. I don't have a complaint about this place. Have been going to the same location for years. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Me and the wife eat here a lot...Where else can you get diner like food after 8pm in NLV after say 8pm? They actually have great servers, food is typically brought out hot, and restaurant is typically clean (except for front entrance where filthy tile and grout) that is due for service! They have decent deals to eat reasonably...There portions are ok for me as well...The business became more commercialized since IHOP took them over..."}
{"text":"All Applebees aren't created equal! I've worked for Applebees all throughout my undergrad years in Petersburg, VA. I've dined at many different Applebees state to state. This Applebees however is horrible!! On different occasions I've had over cooked steak, cold mashed potatoes, wilted lettuce in salads and pretty lame Margaritas.   My visit this past Monday will be my last. I went there to watch the Ravens play the Patriots. They didn't play the the sound on any of the TVS but they played really loud rock and roll  so loud that  we noticed the manager went to the bar to turn the music down twice.   For the life of me I don't understand how sports bars don't play the sound during Sunday, Monday and Thursday nights. In addition, no drink specials during the game?? Oh come on'"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual, and our waiter was a trainee. His trainer was Jerome, who was awesome!!! He made sure we were always taken care off while our waiter completed paperwork, while manning his tables as well!!! 5 stars for Jerome"}
{"text":"Now, I am giving Applebees an additional star because I really enjoyed the meal I had.  The service still lacked and my waitress only showed up twice and did not refill my water glass.  She was absent so much that I ended up drinking my husbands water.  I ordered the Signature Sirloin and Garlic Shrimp off the under 550 calorie menu.  It was pretty good and the serving size was just right.  It came with herbed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, bruschetta (which was not on my plate when served so I have no idea if it is good) and sliced almonds.  The seasonal vegetables was just a big piece of broccoli but it was good.    I waited entirely too long for the bill.  In fact, I told the people with me to go ahead and leave since they had somewhere to be and I waited for the bill and paid when the waitress decided to show up again."}
{"text":"Food was really good which kind of surprised me reading previous reviews.  My problem was the horrifically loud karaoke music playing. The restaurant isn't that big so there just isn't any reason for it to be so loud. We literally couldn't hear each other talk unless it was in between songs for the briefest of moments. Oh and the margarita was so bad I had to return it"}
{"text":"I totally love going to Applebees! Especially on Tuesday's! Karaoke!! Although, this particular Applebees kinda sucks on Karaoke Tuesday's because the d.j.'s aren't as entertaining as other d.j.'s at other Applebees. I was sad about that! But the host's are so damn nice, and cheerful! I just wanted to kiss them all! Oh, and the dinner is good as well."}
{"text":"Great food.  Menu. Was great.  They can't get the orders right.  Easily confused.  I had to beg for A soda refill.  No I'm not leaving A tip.  Especially after they ask for one."}
{"text":"Did the pick 3 appetizer option and while a great value the steak quesadilla is probably better at taco bell or your local taqueria. The mozzarella sticks and boneless wings are nothing to write home about in portion size or orginality.   Although the $1 margaritas for the month if October are amazing and a great deal stick to the unflavored versions.   Vanessa and Clint at bar were amazing and very timely with food and drinks."}
{"text":"Been eating Applebee's for years...pull Into this location hungry as sheet and they said they have 5 min wait while the entire staff goes and sings happy birthday as well as I surval the restaurant with a lot of empty tables...sure you want to go there? It's 8pm on Friday..."}
{"text":"My dinner today is \" Crosscut Ribs  With Honey BBQ \" So good Delicious  Clean.  Friendly Service  .They take care customers  good."}
{"text":"Imagine if the cast of the movie franchise \"Wrong Turn\" were real and were trying to clean their lives up a little and wanted to open up an Applebee's. That's what this is. From a hostess with no social skills (the words you are looking for, dear, are \"you're welcome\" when someone says \"thank you\") to the wait staff who seem to think that the customer should be the one waiting (for a drink, the bill, etc).   When literally every other restaurant has people waiting outside the restaurant to get a seat and there are five or six cars in the Applebee's parking lot, you know you made the wrong choice.   Fire whoever runs this place. Period."}
{"text":"four cheese mac and chees with honey pepper chicken is bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the remodel !  So glad they fixed things . . .Even the staff got better...YAY!  SO - I went to meet a friend for some drinks and was so pleasantly surprised by the remodel. The bartender was freindly and attentive. I ordered some chicken taco things and they were really good, just as she said they would be. I'm still not too excited about the restrooms, need some fixin, so you only get three stars, restrooms for women are important - we gotta sit down! as far as cost, well, Charles H. I expect to pay when I go out, be it happy hour or whatever, you cant put a price on good service!"}
{"text":"Just recently went to an Applebee's after years of not being to one. I was pleasantly surprised. Their look has changed and so has the menu, in good ways. Don't get me wrong the place was still filthy but it's changed. And the food was not disappointing. Had the steak with shrimp and it was delicious! Will probably come back and try their new items."}
{"text":"5-stars! Overall this was a over-satisfying visit. Regular Material :)  Affordable: Ok! - meals are in the range between a low $7 to a high $15 (excluding drink.), but they also have a great deal for couples who can use the 2 for $20 (excluding drink) w/ a choice of an appetizer.  Quality/Flexibility: Great! - They will allow substitutions, me not liking steamed vegetables with my meal, you can choose mash potatoes, baked potatoes or french fries.   *Today I got the 9.oz House Sirloin Steak (well-done) w/ side of mash potatoes & French fries w/ thousand Island dipping sauce. (not all restaurants carry). I had no problems with my order, it came just as specified, juicy and fresh.  Service: Great! - Today was a calm day, though it was the first day of the new year the server was on top of everything.  During our 20-30min stay she asked to refill our drinks at least 6+ times.  And always asking if we needed anything.  Parking: Great! - Tons amount of parking for at least 20-30 cars and if it fill up there is more in the shopping center area. w/ To-Go reservation parking slots included.  Wait-Time: Ok! - Steak took around 15mins-20mins to cook well-done, otherwise other orders I've gotten here take at max 15mins wait time.  P.S. double check your straws, 2nd time having a defect straw that was sealed on one end while packaging. :p"}
{"text":"Came in to enjoy a nice meal instead I got the worst service EVER !! To start the host asked if we wanted to sit in a booth or at the bar then he said they had no booths so sat us at the bar clearly seeing plenty of available Booths After being sat and asked what we wanted to drink(we ordered water with lemon)we waited ten minutes and had to ask our server/host a second time,after waiting another ten minutes we asked another server for some water she went to the back to tell our server when he returned he brought us our water and replied with a smart remark \"here is your water don't trip\" then when we ordered our meal the burger came out dry when I ordered it medium when the waiter said pink or no pink that's all we have,the menu said it came with endless fries when we asked for more fries the waiter charged us for another order of fries which we never received also while we were eating a manager(female)was speaking with our server about another situation a few feet away from our table which should be discussed privately. When we received the bill we waited till we saw the manager(Greg) when we discussed what was wrong with the bill he apologized and and offered 50% off the bill and free dessert when we waited for the Deseret our waiter(kelly p a male server) was making jokes outloud and laughing with the bartender calling us dessert faires intending we complain at diff restaurants to get free dessert, when we payed and were about to walk out our server talking outloud with the female manager says outloud \"it's because I'm black and have aids hahahaha I'm just kidding it was a sexist joke\" who says that at a restaurant and infront of guests. This will be the last time I ever eat at a Applebee's establishment ever again !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Reason why I'm giving them two stars is because I love their  food.  I love their food but I will not be returning to this location ever again, well only when the family meets up for birthdays but other than that heck no.  Seriously their  service is the worse service ever, and every time I go I have a different sever.  I gave them one last chance last night.   Trip 1. Their was a hair in my mash potatoes and the sever was rude, at the time I didn't really want to make a scene because it was my first date with my man and the sever was about to walk off cause I said it's fine. My boyfriend was like no it's not can you get her fresh mash potatoes, they did. Then the manger comes up and we told him about the hair and how the sever was kind of throwing an attitude rolling her eyes and stuff about the hair. The manger would comp are meal.   Trip 2.  I was trying to eat a nice meal with my boyfriend and the busier  wouldn't stop cleaning around us for like the entire meal. He would vacume around our table  cleaning pics around us and it was getting annoying it's like seriously you don't have to be cleaning random stuff just were we were sitting for thirty mints I'm sorry but if you have to be cleaning one section for that long then you must suck at your job because I saw a busier last I night doing the same thing with in five mints and the place looked great. Give her more shifts because she was not a bother.   Trip 3. So mad at this trip were I deiced it was mine and my boyfriends last trip, seriously there is no way you can get bad service this many times at one place. The sever didn't even come to our table for a good three mints and when she did it took her like fifth teen mints to bring out his beer. Really for a beer? Not only that but she wouldn't really give us much contact. She would carry our chips to everyone of  her tables pass it two times then drop it off to us while asking the other table how everything was doing. She didn't ask if we wanted anything,  and didn't check on us or anything. She did the same thing when our diner came out. It's like seriously I don't like watching my food pass me multiple times just drop it off then ask everyone how their doing not like you ask us if things taste good or check on us. She gave us slow service granted it was a little busy but not that busy. They were also out of fries   Last trip: last night I went with my mom it took  five mints for someone to get our drink order. It was a slower night too. I asked for a lemon in my soda didn't get it was going to ask for one but this sever talked so fast that she didn't even give you time to speak or ask questions and would be gone. Then our chips took forever to come out and so did our diner. The place was slow seriously my mom said her steak was cold I just didn't say anything because mine was warm and good, and I love my mom and all but I think she was trying to look for things on purpose because I told her how much bad service me and my boyfriend always get . We were there a good hour, which is horrible for timing on a slow night. I was going to ask for a drink to go but like I said the server just talked way to fast and if you can talk fast enough were I can't ask  for anything that's bad, because I talk fast. I think she was sadly our best sever I have had, at least she checked on us even if she talked fast, I don't know if it was the cooks who took forever or her so I can't judge if she is a good sever or not  but I think she's better than the rest of them.  Oh ya and they were out of fries again seriously how are you out of fries again.  I'm just done with this location just done."}
{"text":"I am so happy that me and my boy friend found an apple bees that we love. The food was hot, fresh and came out super fast for it being super slam. Our drinks were never empty and everyone around us seemed very satisfied. The wings were so good that I ate like a pig and didn't mind looking messy. I had to give this apple bees 5 stars because everything was just perfect I will defiantly be back at this location again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I recently had dinner here.  The 2 for $20 special was pretty decent.  We weren't particularly fond of the music that was playing that evening & our waitress was slow to keep our glasses full.  We appreciated that there was another waitress who brought us a couple of refills on the drinks.  The restaurant wasn't exceptionally busy so there wasn't too much extra noise. Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience here although we'll probably go somewhere else next time we're in town."}
{"text":"(It's been over a year since I stopped eating at chain restaurants altogether, but since I joined Yelp recently, I thought it might be nice to explain why on a case by case basis.)  Cookie cutter food prepared and served by tip-desperate, spirit-crushed, flair-bedecked post adolescents discovering how much corporate food service jobs suck. Bad or non-existent flavors covered up by extra fat and too much salt. Stupid, manufactured decor - where is the factory that makes this crap? Has to be China, or possibly hell.  Irresponsible, unappetizing and despair-inducing."}
{"text":"Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible! For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's."}
{"text":"Food and service A + we love this place. Really awesome vibes. There's never really  long wait.."}
{"text":"went yesterday about 1p.m. and had server that was unattentive to my needs. first I ordered water with lemon and he sent another waitress to give me water, no lemon. I thought ok fine. then received my meal and had no silverware or napkin. I started eating my fries till I had to ask another waitress for the napkin and silverware. He finally showed up when I had my meal 1/2 way eaten and asked if I knew how to use the machine that pays my bill and proceeded to put it in front of me and said you can swipe any time now. Very nicely rude. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in to attempt to have lunch. When we entered they were not busy at all... Kind of dead really. There in front of us was a table of maybe 5 or so servers, socializing. They saw us standing there. No one got up. Finally after waiting 5 minutes, the manager (I assume) walked by the bar and noticed us. She called out to the table of servers and said \"can someone get the door please??\" The table of servers then all looked over at us, and were all clearly annoyed that one of them had to get up to actually work. At that point I just said \"no, that's ok. We'll leave. You're all clearly very busy.\"   Yeah, never going there ever again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and came out quickly. The Happy Hour special off appetizers and drinks late nights is always a plus. If you're staying at the hotel near by you can get 10 percent off your bill. However, i waitress wasn't very attentive and kept messing up."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times trying to give this location a chance. Food has been bad all visits. Got the meatball appetizer last night. The meatballs were old, dried up and reheated. They were visibly gross as well. Was very concerned that any wait staff would brig this to the table. I think last night will be our last visit there."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in awhile.  The service and quality of food has really gone down hill.  Mid-week, mid-day, met some friends who were in town visiting family in that area.  We were seated immediately as it was not the least busy.  Took forever to get our drinks of iced teas and a soda.  Took our order of everyone having a burger and the long wait began.  Two burgers wrong, none came with any lettuce, tomato, etc.  Flagged down server and sat and waited while our food got cold.  Fries tasted old and stale.  By now everyone was pressed for time and didn't even want the food.  Never got drink refills we asked for and nobody checked on us until it was time to present the bill.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The good was TERRIBLE! In addition to that the service was even WORSE! No ice, the food was not cooked properly as well as it took forever for anything to finally make it to our table! We will never return to this particular place AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Very good service! The interior atmosphere is perfect for a relaxing lunch. The waitress Jennifer was so nice to offer a 10% discount due to the steak I ordered was oversalted. Thank you Jennifer :)"}
{"text":"The waiter (Joe) & bartender worked very slow.. we waited for our first round of drinks very long... the food was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner at the suggestion of someone who loved Applebee's in New York.   Ordered the appetizers \"Classic Combo\" which included mozzarella sticks, spinach/artichoke dip, nacho chips, cheese quesadillas.  It was a plentiful dish at happy hour pricing.  I found the dip to be a bit salty although I usually love salty things.  Another diner ordered the mozzarella sticks which were typical \"mozzarella\" sticks.  Nothing special, nothing bad.  They were, however, sizably portioned.    Now comes the bad.   I ordered the fried shrimp combo which comes with coleslaw and french fries.  I asked to get a baked potato instead of fries.  The platter arrived and the shrimp were small and chunky, meaning they were not butterflied.  The proportion of batter to shrimp was a little heavy.  The cole slaw tasted fresh.  The baked potato seemed to have something oily on the outside and salt.  I have had baked potatoes before at other restaurants (Red Lobster) which were salted on the outside, but that was not what looked strange.  The potato was yellowish on the inside and had some \"watery\" stuff inside.  It was not butter.  I tasted it and gave it a second and third tasting just to try to determine why it looked and tasted so differently (it almost didn't taste like a baked potato).  As an experienced cook, I figuered it out.  They used an eastern potato which is an inexpensive, high water content potato which should never be baked if indeed you want a great tasting baked potato.  Further, I think they boiled it first and then baked it which caused it to be even more watery.  A good idaho potato (which is what should have been used)  is a starchy potato which bakes beautifully and absorbs butter or sour cream whatever is your fancy.  They are also more expensive which is probably why it was not used. I told the waitress about the \"baked\" potato and she had a gentleman come over and I explained the issue.  He asked me what I would like to substitute and I selected garlic mashed potatoes which BTW turned out to be delicious.   Later on another gentlemen came by to ask if everything had been resolved.   The Triple Chocolate Melt came with Vanilla ice cream which was delicious and big enough to share.   So I am giving one star for Courtney F. our server who was efficient and courteous, and one for the management for correcting the baked potato issue.  However, I was still very disappointed with the quality of the shrimp I was served as I was truly looking forward to a good shrimp platter."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out service a few times, the latest this weekend, and everything has been great. Food order was correct and warm, server was professional. No complaints."}
{"text":"Went last night for Mother's Day dinner and like always we got great customer service. Sister and I tried there strawberry lime margarita a definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, great drinks, unfortunately they forgot a third of our order as it never came out but we were charged for it. No biggie, stuffed anyway and the missing item was quickly taken off the bill. The bartenders on 1-9-15 were attentive and great given how busy it was. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"OK, I know.   It's Applebee's, so many of you restaurant connoisseurs are making a smooshy face right now and considering clicking away. And that's OK - the fact that there are only three reviews of Applebee's on Vista Way tells me that either yelpers don't eat there or they are too embarrassed to check in.  I feel you, but I'm totally cool with Applebee's.  There's nothing generally \"big deal\" about this chain restaurant. My wife and I were dating almost twenty years ago at the Applebee's in Middleburg, so maybe I have a little sentimental thing happening (and I do honestly miss that old formulation of the Tequila Lime Chicken) but also, it's really a good spot if, like me, you have two 16 year olds who just completed an athletic event and hadn't had dinner yet because the varsity matches don't start until 7 PM (we won, by the way).   Just because there is no \"big deal\" doesn't mean I won't eat there - as you can see by my reviews, I'm a big fan of greasy spoons and dives, so Applebee's is a big night out for me. Well, not really, but I don't have an automatic judgment for Applebee's either.  So the details: The restaurant was nearly completely empty at 9:30 PM on a Tuesday which was not unexpected. We were of course seated immediately. The service was very efficient and the food items came out quickly and correctly. All of this is good because there was absolutely no reason for any kind of error to happen. Some mozzarella sticks, A burger, some macaroni and cheese with shrimp, and a Thai salad. All the food was good and the service was good as well. Like I said, no culinary ground is really being broken here. One nice special was the dessert S'mores Churros. A Churro as you probably know is a fried dough dessert that is usually in a stick or tube form and rolled in sugar and cinnamon. In this case, the churros were served with warm dipping chocolate and marshmallow fluff. The teens were quite happy to eat them.  Bill for three with dessert was around $45 including tip.   I feel like I should address the issue of the building site since one person seems to have reviewed the architecture rather than the actual restaurant - yes, the Vista View site was built on a landfill, and yes Wal-Mart ran out on their lease because of the perception of instability - allegations of gas leaking from the landfill into structures, et cetera. These issues have all been investigated by multiple agencies independent of the city and the developers, and if these structures were unsafe these businesses would not operate here. The side where the Applebees is has quite a few restaurants in place. It does look like a barren wasteland looking toward the Giant Eagle plaza, and there is a partially built structure nearby - so I agree that it's not picturesque, but since I'm not reviewing geology or structural engineering, I'm giving this restaurant good marks."}
{"text":"Alex the server did a good job taking our orders, keeping drinks filled and our orders were correct. My daughter enjoyed the steak quesadilla. The Southwestern Steak Salad tasted fine, the steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri was tasty. Everything came out on time, service was perfect.  But.  The salad was undersized. The four pieces of steak looked forlorn. There was no lime. There were empty spaces on a plate that should have been covered with salad. Compare the two posted photos; this is the equivalent of the photo of the fast-food burger vs what emerges from the foil and paper bag. Except this cost 4 times as much and had possibly less actual beef.   Everything else was as good as an American casual chain restaurant can be. But this salad was frankly baffling."}
{"text":"My favorite Applebee's in town, except tonight they should've had more servers. My server was awesome his name was Will, he was working really hard and trying to give us the best service he could. I think he could've used some help from other servers, I asked a gentleman for my cup of water to be refilled and he basically ignored me. My server Will was busy at the time so I had to wait until he had a chance to refill my cup which was about 10-15 Min wait. Saturday nights should have more staff."}
{"text":"This Was The Worst Service i have ever Received my server Cedric was Horrible! And it was my birthday i told him and showed my id and I did not receive a smile or well round happy birthday. The food was bad, my sister didn't get to eat cause her food was burnt and the manager acted like he didn't want to talk to us &&& the bartender was very rude i asked for a cup of ice she just kept asking what ! With a mug on her face . I will never go back to apple bees period and Im calling corporate! They need to shut it down"}
{"text":"Went there today 5/5 for lunch.  This place has changed and I won't be back.  Marginal food."}
{"text":"I brought my family of four to this Apple Bees, we were seated at a dirty booth. Asked the waitress to wipe it down and she did, she was friendly enough too. My wife received filthy silver wear then returned it to the waitress only to get more filthy silver wear covered in dry food. The food was mediocre but the gross silver wear pretty much made us lose our appetite. The waitress apologized for the problem and stated she had advised the manager of this, the manager didn't bother to stop and apologize or anything. We will never return."}
{"text":"Such an awful experience. Food is terrible and service is even worse. My shrimp was gray so i sent it back and asked for a menu to order something else.. and i didnt recieve and menu until my entire table was  finished eating. Long story short i took my business else where."}
{"text":"Wow this place has server issues to be sure.  I have been involved in the restaurant industry for many year as both front and back of house and this pace I will not revisit.  I arrived at 830  and was seated promptly no issues and I sat till 845 with menu closed and was then asked if I was helped yet, i replied that I had not ,the server then came over. It was now 850. I sat for 20 minutes and no one even bothered to take my order. My fault for not flailing my arms in the air and screaming for assistance  Such as one server did to me when she yelled \"chips\" right behind my and giggled, and nonissue not order chips . Annoying? Yes but maybe that's her idea of fun and joking around.   When my server Vito came to take my order informed him that I would be ordering dinner but that I would like to get happy hours apps during my meal... I promise you that was about the last time I saw my server for over a half hour. Really? A half hour? I don't get why my drink (iced t) was only filled once during my entire meal by request and I couldn't ask more because there was no one to ask.   never got to order my appetizer  and I was just dumb struck why a chicken parmigiana dinner took made a short dinner into a one hour + meal?   The second issue was my sever Vito asked me a question as he walked past my table not even waiting for my response. I wanted to ask for refill on my iced t and I wanted to order a happy hour app. Neither happened. Another server walked by the table and tossed some napkins on it and just kept walking by doing that to the other tables. I felt so disrespected. As for the meal, it was edible but it had an amazing amount of marinara on it. I've only given one review that was limited stars and I hate doing it but this place didn't sit well for me   I asked for the bill and he then set up the little table device for me to pay basically stating just tap the pay in full icon.  I wanted to use cash and he assumed I would use a card   I felt very low, cheated and disrespected If you go be warned and maybe just drink a lot of beer then maybe you won't care about spending your hard earned money and still being ignored   this place? ever again   Why the 2 stars? The host was nice and well that's really it. Oh yes the parking lot was near empty so finding parking was easy... maybe if I knew what it was like I would have figured why limited cars"}
{"text":"I love this location, they always have friendly staff. This is my husband's and my favorite place to come for date night. I love their margaritas. Overall it's one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The water in the restroom doesn't get hot and the floor is sticky eeeeww!!!.  The bathroom is unkept.  Service is slooow.  The food is sparse and looks nothing like the photos in the menu.   We waited 45 minutes for our food. Waiter was inattentive."}
{"text":"Definitely don't was your time or money go somewhere else! The only good thing was the house salad.  I ordered a sandwich with sauce on the side and the sauce cup was used before me, it even had sticky fingerprints on it. And the sandwich didn't even have what it was supposed to have on it."}
{"text":"So the new tech at the table is great for ordering apps, desert and paying the bill.  Aside from that that want to charge .99 cents for everything.  With a smart phone you can play trivia pursuit from the back of a catsup bottle.  So the portions are super small.  I had the brisket nachos, not sure there w actually ant meat on the thing.  Wife had a new pasta dish with chicken strips.  The plate q almost $12.  The thee chicken strips were smaller than a pinky.  Service was okay, but not enough to over come the rest of the downside."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! If I could give them a half a star, I would.   Came to give them one more try.  Had free coupons from a pervious complaint, and sadly the experience was WORSE than the last one!   We waited almosy 15 minutes for a server to even come for a drink order.  We ordered a beer and i requested a mixed drink from their menu.  10 minutes a very stressed server came back to tell me that they didnt have the ingredients, so to make things easier I just ordered something in a bottle. That took another 10 minutes. I'm not really sure what the bartender was doing, but I'm pretty sure her predominant duties were to stand around with a sour face. We ordered a combo appetizer and two soups and it took 45 minutes!   I could go on, but wont waste another minute on this horrible location. Such a shame too because I choose applebees in many other locations."}
{"text":"Mediocre, they name is Applebees. Maybe I expect too much? Maybe I'm just used to higher quality food? Maybe I'm a snob? Tough meat, WAY oversalted everything. Nothing tasted fresh at all. The chicken fingers were rubbery and not very good. Actually, nothing was very good. I had a grilled chicken something that was pretty gross... even when I just tried to eat the chicken breast itself, it was tasteless other than the mass proliferation of salt.  I remember back in the day, I used to like Applebees for their burgers. I don't know if their burgers are still any good, but I don't know that I'd return to even find out."}
{"text":"I had started to really stray from Applebees---but they have revamped the menu in a great way....though the revamp did raise their prices slightly.  We like to sit at the bar as usually there isn't a wait and the service is faster.  I love their french onion soup and wedge salad."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because the host and manager were very friendly. Unfortunately that's the only thing pleasant about this visit. I don't normally do this considering I work in the restaurant business but this was by far the worst service I have ever had. After being seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come greet us and take our drink order. (Jessica b is what the receipt said). Nachos came out with burnt chips but surprisingly still were very good! However I asked for a side of BBQ after the food was dropped off and had to ask a second time. Which by the time I did get it I was done eating. My daughter ordered a sirloin that was way over cooked and hard for her to eat. I ordered a chicken quesadilla it came out wrong and they fixed it but by the time my server finally did drop it off I lost my appetite over her poor service skills. I will try a different location next time if any."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Applebee's many times over the last 10 years. I think the food is very average and although I do not eat here very often. When I do the staff is always friendly and provides assistance in regards to the menu when needed. There happy hour is awesome and appetizers are 50% off during happy hour. I have had there baby back ribs, chicken quesadillas,bbq chicken salad, and burgers. The food is fresh even though it is just average American grub."}
{"text":"Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.  So, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again."}
{"text":"One has to wonder who Applebee's in Surprise has in mind for their target customer base, because it isn't anyone who desires a clean restaurant or attentive staff.    No doubt that the restaurant industry is highly competitive.  And those who are on the leading edge understand that it all comes down to customer service.  One can find a burger, steak, and other run-of-the-mill entrees just about anywhere... but the restaurant that provides a level of customer service second to none will build a following that propels them to the top of their competitors.  Unfortunately, Applebee's in Surprise seriously lacks this understanding.  My wife and I walked into Applebee's with our 2yo granddaughter Saturday night around 7pm... the place was less than 15% full.  We stood quite some time by the hostess area waiting for the hostess to come around; she didn't.  I walked around hoping to grab the attention of someone working there.  A few wait staff walked by without saying anything while others were huddled up together by the back of the bar laughing and joking.  Finally someone (she might have been the absentee hostess) asked if we had been helped and then sat us.  Where she parked us was a pigsty.  Yes, the table was clean, but the floors all around and underneath were about as filthy as it could get without the health department shutting them down.  We sat there for (no kidding) 5 minutes waiting for our server to come over.   One young lady working there asked asked if we had been helped, I told her no, so she huffed and turned around walking off quickly.  Another 3 to four minutes passed before our server came over introducing herself.  We had our menus when we sat down so we told our server we were ready to order.  A few minutes later a guy server brought our iced teas out, but the way he was holding them he had his hands and finger all over the rims of the glasses.  And he wasn't the cleanest looking dude, either.   There were approximately 24 empty tables all around us on our side of the restaurant and the hostess decided to sit the next group right beside us.  Not a big issue, but with a 2 yo standing in the booth one might think the hostess would've considered given the other group a little buffer space.  Nope.  The food came out was decent.  No complaints... it just wasn't anything to brag about.  At some point during our dinner a different server came by to sweep the area.  I commend her, but this task should be performed when there aren't customers at the table so not to by intrusive.  Apparently their floor sweeper was broke (possibly the handle), so the young lady was on here knees moving the sweeper back and forth trying to clean next to us.  Again, I commend her on her energy and effort.  Yet a different server walked over giggling and laughing very loudly like a very silly high school kid asking the other what she was doing.  The lady on the floor said, \"I'm cleaning!  And the sweeper is broke.\"  The other girl laughed even more hysterically (very unprofessional) and walked off.  All-in-all, I hated my experience at Applebee's last night.  And this isn't the first time the experience has been immensely sub-par.  I don't know anything about the management at this location, but it seems they should consider a refocus of efforts towards customer service as a tangible asset in building their business... as the lack of it will lead to their downfall."}
{"text":"We have been going nearly every Sunday for a couple months now that we work night shifts and they are open late. The first night we had a male manager who made a point of stopping by and signing us up for the applebees club, the bartender was awesome and food was great. The next couple of times the bartenders changed but were still decent but not as good. Tonight July 26th, the bartender, while nice enough was not attentive and we never saw the manager except when we were the last people and she was staring at us so we would leave. I still had a full drink btw. I understand they were closing but they still needed to clean the kitchen etc. They weren't going to be walking out the door for at least another hour so 10 more minutes to finish my drink shouldn't have been an issue. No one said anything but the manager staring at us was uncomfortable so we left. Didn't even offer to comp a drink next visit. Food always amazing tho."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Apple Bees for 5 + years now and I have to say it is the BEST apple bees. I have been to about three other apple bees, but this is the best by far! The staff is extremely welcoming, friendly, fun and make you feel right at home. I truly love being serve by the bartenders Ashley, and Cierra. The managers are also very nice and always check on you while you're eating or drinking to ensure everything is perfect. The night life here is so fun and even the customers are so friendly! I love this Apple Bees!"}
{"text":"Don't get to go out very often and typically when I do, I get horrible service from kids who no longer know what customer service is... However the visit last night turned my thoughts around and got me lookin forward to going out to eat my one night I have a week!  Josh our server was the best service I've had in a very long time. Tip: there is a rib let's shortage so don't order that, but when I did, Josh was so apologetic and explained they didn't have it. When my honey asked for his sides he nicely explained it came with set sides but he'd be happy to substitute. Idk as of late we've had a lot of people telling us we were wrong or being almost condescending if we altered the menu. Either way Josh was phenomenal though he had 2 things negative happen to him right of the jump he recovered well and was clam and cool the whole time. We went in on Sat night around 9:30, tables were full and Josh had a larger section to cover. Didn't matter he came to our table dozens of times, told us where he was at in helping us, I mean just so attentive! He explained the touch pad and made it easy and convenient for us to order our appetizers. Being in customer service management I really, truly appreciate good service and recognize how much the country can lack these days. Oh yeah the food was great, we had great happy hour specials we didn't know were running so that was a nice surprise! Got 3 apps, 2 entree meals, & apparently it's $1 Bahama Mama month so take advantage of that. We ate until we could eat anymore and still had left overs. Josh was quick to refill drinks, tell me what I ordered was his favorite (I love that) and get our to go boxes. He explained the pad for payment but still said he could take it if easier. I know how it works this cuts your time down and allows you to provide better service to everyone, we got you Applebee's. Go to this location. It's smaller but I like that, everyone was friendly and the food was cooked well! But this review was written mostly to give Josh the recognition he deserves for providing the very best Service out there...I recommended Applebee's, praise him and encourage him to stay with the co. Because he is why I will be returning to Applebee's and that location, and I will always ask for Josh. Though I hope he can make he way up because he worked hard and we loved it! Great job Applebee's"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last week. Both times it was the car side to go, and both times we had the pleasure of having the same waitress. Carrie. I had been in the restaurant industry for over a decade as a manager, and have seen lots of waiters/waitresses in my time. I can honestly say that Carrie was one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of having wait on me. She is very knowledgeable and experienced and even better than I that is she is an honest to goodness nice person. We get the 2 for $20 sirloin steaks every time we go, and for an extra $2.99 I add parmesan shrimp to mine. I got 7 shrimp along with my meal, plus both entrees came with two sides and we got an app. In all it came to less then $25. Like I told the management even if we didn't like the food as much as we do we would still come back just because Carrie is that great. I"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bahama Mama drink special of the month which was a huge deal for how large of a drink you get!  The service was modest but reasonable for the busy hours.  My suggestion would be to fix their computers or train employees better on partially used gift cards.  I gave them my card with credit on it and received no credit to the bill."}
{"text":"Bartender/server named Steve was the rudest person I've ever seen or encountered inside of a restaurant or service industry in general. The employees at fast food places and dollar stores know how to simply be polite. This guy should be fired immediately. He's driving away business. I have no idea how he's even employed in the service industry. The hostess however was very polite and nice. She deserves a raise and promotion."}
{"text":"Service is always good with des, (desiree). She is always quick friendly and open to giving suggestions.  BRING BACK CRISP CUT RIBS! We were saddened to come here excited to have them and find out you no longer serve."}
{"text":"We just left from having dinner at this location and we will never be back. Lexy, the hostess sat us down immediately. She at first sat us a table and we requested a booth and she was very accommodating. Lexy let us know that she would tell our server that we requested a booth and be right back. Minutes later we see the manager come over and have a very clipped conversation about where she seated us. However, once we were seated we were not asked about drinks by our waiter. It wasn't until 10 minutes later that Lexy, the hostess, checked on is. She apologized and took out drink order. Shortly after we finally got out drinks from Selma who also apologized for the wait. Brian, our server took our order for appetizers and our meals. We were served our food and my daughter finds a hair in the spinach dip! So gross. We paid our tab and we will not return. The servers were nice but very slow. The best part of our time here was Lexy."}

Its not bussy for a saturday not sure why my food didnt come out how i asked for it"}
{"text":"My wife ordered 4 Cheese Mac and Cheese with Chicken Strips, and I ordered the Firecracker  Shrimp Cavatoppi. What I received was mac and cheese with some tiny fried shrimp on it.  It was bad.  I sent it back and ordered ribs, because who can screw up ribs.  Well it appears Applebee's can.  The ribs were dry and tough.  And to make matters worse, my wife found ants at the table.  However, they did give us $5 off (LOL). This is our first time going to Applebee's in 10 years and we won't be back."}
{"text":"We're from out of town,  and after reading the reviews we were worried, but we had a gift card so we went. We were met at the door with a Hello and welcome  by an employee who held it open for us. Our server was there right after we were seated. There was nothing wrong with the food at all. Fast, prompt and exactly as I expected Applebees to taste. My steak was cooked to order, food was hot. Drinks never team empty.  Our server was attentive, accurate, and patient. The only thing I could say is the employees need to smile. It was very business like - polite, attentive,  but not much as far as a smile. No one needs to be overly bubbly, but sometimes in a restaurant atmosphere, customers want a little bubble. The pep was there though.  Overall,  based on the past reviews, our experience was amazing! No issues!"}
{"text":"Applebee's is yet another chain restaurant that charges way more than they should for their food.  I was hungry.  I was fed.  So, it did it's job.    I sat at the bar with a friend and we did have great service.  Very attentive and friendly.    This will likely never be my first suggestion for dining when a guest comes to town, but for an Applebee's, this location is fine."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING (BAD Hygiene)  This was by far the worst experience Ive ever had. I came in extremely hungry. I ordered the 2 for twenty. They forgot about my salad, 20 min later the bar tender decides to check on it. She brought it back with her. They threw lettuce on the plate with dressing on the side. I asked if they no long tossed their salads..... 20 min after the salad came out both dishes arrived freezing cold. The manager brought out the food, disregarding the quality. I asked the bartender if they could cook the food more and warm everything up. The second time the food came out the mash pots had a 1in root in it. I pulled it out of my mouth almost throwing up. I was so grossed out. I told the manager that there was some type of bone or plastic in the pots.  She picked up the thing I just pulled out of my mouth with her fingers. I gave her a weird look. \"ma'am i just pulled that out of my mouth\". She said oh my hands are clean....  Then she started to justify that it was a root and they forgot to clean the potatoes, regardless that should have never been there. She took 50% off the meal. She was not appologetic at all. I don't understand how you can mess up literally everything. Plus Im a bit concerned with the hygiene of the establishment. Ive never seen anyone pick up something with their bare hands. That is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday night around 11:15pm. The music was blaring and it felt like an ice box. I wanted to leave but we were hungry and thirsty. The music was so loud we had to shout to talk. I was shivering and my hands were like ice. (Just because it's hot outside doesn't mean people like to freeze inside). Luckily, my friend had a long sleeve shirt he offered to get for me. I gladly accepted.   The bartender was our server. He seemed rushed and quickly mentioned some of the happy hour specials. When he came back to take our order, he was a little more helpful with menu choices. Overall, he was quick with our drinks and service. HH food choices weren't that great. I believe there were only 4 items.   I give it 3 stars based on the atmosphere. If and when I come back, I will bring a sweatshirt."}

{"text":"Though our server was great, we came here to watch the Yankees game. Before being seated, we asked if they had the game, which we were told they do. Only after having sat down and ordered were we told they don't get Fox (who was airing the game). Very disappointed we came here."}
{"text":"Have been a loyal Applebee's patron for years in San Diego. This is our 3rd disappointing visit to this location. Always used to order the shrimp and Parmesan top sirloin. Last time we were here my daughter and I both ordered it and neither order was cooked correctly. The medium was rare and the medium well was rare. The shrimp and parmesan topping was minuscule and watery. Disappointing. This time I ordered a perfect margarita which tasted like drinking straight from a bottle of sweet and sour. First time I have ever sent a drink back for being undrinkable. The replacement was 25 minutes coming out and nearly as bad as the first.  The full rack ribs was charcoal. Really burnt, really dry. Tasted like burnt charcoal. So sad. I really liked Applebee's."}
{"text":"Really wish I could give negative stars for this place. Best part of of time there was walking out. The worst service and management I have seen and I have been in the service industry a long time. We ordered the 2 for 20 and a couple kids meals.. Over a hour and out appetizer never came until once we got our check and even then the two salads we got had maybe 6 drops of dressing at most. Restaurant was not that busy maybe 25 people max. We were told the kitchen was backed up but yet the manager on duty had time to stand around the bar and talk to servers and watch tv, when he should have jumped back in the kitchen and helped them. Our server was great since it wasn't his fault and all the other people were waiting on food for a while too. Manager never came by even after the server let him know that out salads came out. Once he told the manager and said they would make them to go for us It took another 10 to 15 minutes! We used to come here a lot but the way they are running this place will be why they all close. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went in there wanting to have my favorite Chinese Grilled Chicken Salad and was rudely interrupted by a customer who cried about MY cologne being too strong for her and I could NOT get out fast enough for her to STOP bitching about ME AND calling me names!!!  NO ONE accommodated ME in keeping me there!!  So I left!!!  Like if I did ANY thing wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Seriously. I hate Yelpers because most of them cry or try to be these expert review panelists, but this place is utter trash. They won't pick up the phone and it's just a disaster. Save yourself time and money."}
{"text":"Poor quality food and service. Our waitress Jewel gave us attitude the entire time and didn't check on us but twice during a two hr visit. The food tasted sub par and had an off putting after taste similar to hard boiled eggs. Never got refills on our drinks and they got snarky when we asked if our favorite was still there and Coke to find out it was discontinued two months ago. We hadn't eaten at Applebee's in two years so we had no idea what was part of the menu! We got a steak and two side items and they up charged  us ridiculously and it turned into a $25 bill. Definitely not the quality worthy of that price! Add to all that that we both got food poisoning after our meal. Overall the worst possible service we have ever received from an Applebees location. Will never return to this location"}
{"text":"Do not eat here my fries were really oily and my mac and cheese was cold and wings were cold!! I have given this applebees enough chances will not ever ever return even out of desperation to eat!!! I even informed the manger of how messed up the meal was and he did even say anything and smiled like an ass!!! DONT eat here i would give them 0 if i could !!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:55 on a Sunday, if the fact that we had to wait 5 minutes for a hostess to greet us although the restaurant was half empty wasn't the key for us to run we ignored the signs. After waiting 20 minutes we observed several already seated parties leaving and complaining of the wait. We still stayed because I insisted on Applebee's. After waiting another 20 minutes for our server to take a drink order and waiting another 25 mins for the appetizer to arrive cold. We still hung in and received cheese less 4 cheese Mac and cheese, a well done steak instead of a medium, no ketchup for burgers, sour yogurt for the kids and no apologies for the poor service. A server quit, the manager seemed to have little to no idea of how to get the ball back rolling.  To sum it up: grossly understaffed, horrible service, cold appetizers and tasteless food. Don't waste your time. It's 9:28 and we're walking out now."}
{"text":"The service is very  slow...... By the time I get my meal  I will be 80 years old. The food  tasted good"}
{"text":"I came here after an open mic and Jorge was one of the nicest and most polite servers that I have ever met. I tell you when you have A1 service it's hard to have anything less and he did his job very well. I appreciate great service from people that bring a positive human experience to their job and make it a great time. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Dependable chain restaurant quality, excellent service, and we've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a seat."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and I neighborhood Applebee's Took our order forgot the shrimp on the steak and shrimp dinner French onion soup was cold and tast like straight out of the can ordered a chicken Caesar salad and didn't even get the chicken on our salad The hostess very disrespectful when I asked her to stop gossiping behind my back she replied I don't give a shit  Manager did take off 20% of my bill but I still feel that after she replied that to mean not even a 20% to make up for the experience I had for dinner this evening $60 dollars and a ton of restoration you might want to think twice about going to your neighborhood Applebee's look in a different neighborhood !!!"}
{"text":"My server was awesome. But food was meh. I ordered the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. It came with mushroom but there was only 5 pieces not like what was shown in the picture. Chicken was good. I think people just come here for drinks and appetizers. But I'll give them 4 stars just cause the server was nice."}
{"text":"Came here to eat apps for a friend's birthday. Waited an hour for mozzarella sticks. Absolutely horrible service. Every time I attempted to let my server know I was still waiting for my food while the rest of the party had their food I was told \"wait a minute\" and was ignored. I then witnessed the server and manager discussing the situation on the dining floor a few tables a way. Manager came over and said \"I cancelled the moz sticks\". I told him, I wanted my food. Once I finally received my food, it was time to pay. The manager comped an appetizer, which we didn't ask for or care about, and I payed the remaining bill plus the birthday boys drinks using a card on their table systems. I left a tip even though she most definitely did not deserve one at all and completed a survey (with the waitress standing over the table waiting for me to finish). As I was able to leave I was told wait, we have to confirm your payment, it's not showing up in our systems. I've never received such horribly rude service in my life and been publicly embarrassed in such a manner. I showed my bank statement showing my payment and was STILL asked to show them my debit cards last 4 numbers.   We asked for a happy birthday song and they laughed. The birthday boy is a VETERAN. No happy birthday song. Discounts don't compensate for shitty service. Also, the entire staff looked extremely sloppy like they were all high. And they moved like it too. Slower than hell. We were told to chug our drinks so they could reuse our glasses. They weren't even busy. So I'm assuming they only have 10 of these glasses. We even said we didn't mind if they were put in a different glass and we're told they needed our glasses to get us a new drink.     If you want to wait 20 mins for a $1 Long Island and get your food forgotten about hit this place up. If you like a sanitary place that provides quality service and respects their customers, I strong urge you to look elsewhere.   This would be a ZERO if possible."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Applebees 4 or 5 times before.  Today I met two old classmates of mine that I have not seen in 30 some years.  (Keep in mind all 3 of us are retired and over 70 yrs old). We were promptly seated and within minutes a waitress took our order. Just then a group of 16 came in next to us, and the other tables began to fill up.  Within 20 minutes we received our orders, everything was hot, perfectly prepared and seasoned.  Our plates were cleared off  and the check was at our table within a reasonable length of time,  The 3 of us had a good long conservation and a wonderful dining experience.  I highly recommend this Applebee location to anyone that wants an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Customer service is always great so that's a plus. Anytime I go to any Applebee's location I get the same thing... The Mac n cheese with the honey pepper chicken. Usually when I get it, the chicken is already covered in the honey pepper sauce and it's delicious. The three times I have come here, there is either no sauce on the chicken... Or it's BARELY speckled on. The third time I came here I specifically asked my server to make sure that the chicken was already tossed in the sauce. And I was excited because it's delicious.. however when I got my food (as you will see in the picture) there still was no sauce on my chicken. That really annoyed me that I had to specifically ask for my meal to be prepared as it appears on the menu, and it still didn't. It was like having an overly fried chicken finger on top of my pasta. Secondly when we got our blondie, which we also get every time, it was stale and old. You could tell it was not fresh or even made that day. The texture felt like expired bread and it wasn't even warm. I always assumed they reheated the brownies anyway but this one was just disgusting and did not taste like dessert at all. After three strikes, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Carside to Go....  I placed a carside to go order on the phone. Unfortunately, you can't use the applebees app for this :( The food was ready when I arrived 20 minutes later. I ordered 2 lunch combos (both pastas with Caesar salads). The mac and cheese was delicious. The Cajun shrimp pasta was just okay. The Caesar salads were fine.   I love the fact that Applebee's brings your food to the car for to go orders. This is one of the differentiating factors this restaurant has when compared to others. I would like for the app to be better (updated menu with ability to order) and more flavorful dishes. I will definitely return to this establishment although it isn't a place I will visit regularly.   I simply couldn't give it more than 3 stars primarily because of the food...I have rated other, much better tasting, restaurants 4 stars. However, nothing \"bad\" happened on this visit. It was just fine, not memorable."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We decided to eat at this one rather than the Elyria location (do yourself a favor eat there not at this one) because we happened to be closer and didn't want to drive all the way out to Elyria.   Big mistake. I never got a refill and the waitress would pop over to our table and leave before I could request anything. Food was good. And was cooked correctly so no issues with that.   Manager was nice.   This location has had issues since it opened. And it seems things haven't changed."}
{"text":"Happy hour 1/2 price grilled chicken wonton were excellent!!!    Thai salad good and Pulled pork Pub sandwich good."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my son here.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly.  Even though the place was not busy, it took a very long time to get our food and we only ordered hamburgers.  The two pieces of basil draped across the top of my open-faced hamburger were wilted and dried out and the bun was blackened.  Possibly left under the heat lamp too long?  I think the part that bothered me most was the dirty floors and the absolutely filthy greasy card reader terminal on the table.  Can't the employees see this?  Do they even care?"}
{"text":"Service was good at the bar.  The food was normal for Applebees.  I decided to try the bottomless crosscut ribs.  Don't waste your money, they are the same riblets that they have served for years and not worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly server who was able to get steak on my caesar salad which I very much enjoyed. Comfortable and the food was enjoyable much as it is at other ANG&B's"}
{"text":"Food was poorly prepared. Too hot and then other items cold. Service was far and yet the best part of the visit. Will not repeat"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight to celebrate my husband's birthday and the service was horrible. The waitress disappeared numerous times and the food was mediocre at best. We had to ask for silverware, napkins and refills from other servers we had to flag down.   My meal was disappointing. The cedar salmon with maple mustard glaze doesn't actually come with spinach like the description and photo in the menu suggests. I was informed by the manager that it's merely a \"garnish\". So the 6 wilted leaves of spinach hiding under my over-cooked, fishy-tasting, most-likely previously frozen salmon weren't officially there as part of the meal. After commenting about it to the waitress, she looked at me with the \"what do you want me to do about it\" look.  About 5 minutes later, she returned with an appetizer plate with about 10 steamed leaves of spinach on it. The broccoli was mushy and over cooked. The baked potato was simply that. I would have been embarrassed serving that plate to someone. My husband said his burger was ok. The spinach dip tasted ok, but the ramekin was half full and it looked like it had been sitting there for a while.   There is zero pride taken into the way things are plated or delivered. For an $82 check, I could have gone somewhere else for shitty food and crappy service. It was such a painful experience all around. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Applebees is always a nice little quick restaurant to go to.  Never realized the happy hour specials they have their though.  Came here with a friend cause she's never been to one even though she's in her 20's.  I didn't think that was possible O_O  we both got chicken fingers so nothing really to quite rate the dish on that was extraordinary.  Just your basic chicken and fries basket.  Staff was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I have been here more than once, but I think I will not return.  On this trip Full Rack of Ribs,Steak Salad, and Mack and Cheese with Bacon and Chicken Fingers all was to go (take away). They should have called them chicken pinkies. That was the worst Mac and Cheese I have ever tried to eat. I would rather eat Kraft Microwave cups. Look at the photo and you tell me. The ribs were chain ribs, at least the lettuce wasn't rusty."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to visit a chain and haven't been to an Applebees in years but  I was pleasantly surprised when we visited last Monday.  It was a holiday and the place was packed for lunch.  The hostess opened the door for us and quickly had us seated in a nice sunny booth by the window.  Our waitress was fantastic-she took our order quickly and checked back on us often.  They have a lot of fun non-alcoholic drinks and my husband went with a berry lemonade which included free refills!  We ordered the chicken wonton wraps as an appetizer and they were the perfect size, very tasty with a sweet glaze on the chicken and veggies.  There are a lot of nice lunch combos for $6.99-$8.99  and I went with the chicken tortilla soup with a side salad with bacon. The soup had the perfect amount of spice and the side salad was a pretty hefty portion.  We could not skip the dessert and I went with the brownie a la mode which was decadent.  The prices are reasonable and of course a fine place to take the family."}
{"text":"Going down hill fast  When you want the onions grilled on your hamburger you should have to pay an extra 2.50 to get them grilled.   They don't clean their condiment bottles after each guest... on the germs yuck.  It's too bad that the food is comparable to Dennys"}
{"text":"No thanks. Typical chain restaurant. Bland food, practically no vegetarian options, and it looks like the food was just slapped on the plate. I guess this could be a half-way decent place for travelers who don't know the area, and need somewhere they've heard of before to eat. However, if you're from the area, choose something local in my opinion. There are a plethora of restaurants right out your front door with more diverse selections and interesting ambience. Don't go for the same old same old unless you absolutely have to. One of the only things this place has going for it is it's ability to accommodate large groups quicker and easier than a smaller, niche restaurant. Also, if you like the big azz frozen drinks, go here. So, a happy hour joint more or less."}
{"text":"Jeffrey, our server was really nice and energetic. He made sure everything was good and was constantly checking on us."}
{"text":"Shout out to our server Matt! This was the second time we have had him as our server and he is a delight. I brought my daughters in for dinner after taking them to get pictures done and to be honest I am/was quite tired. I paid the bill on the kiosk and as soon as he thought there may have been an issue with my bill he promptly addressed it and made sure all was well. That is the kind of customer service that is not very common. Thank you to him and the manager on duty for making sure that we had a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"The waiter is rude, she spilled beer on the phone didn't bring napkins when we asked looked like she got an attitude. The manager guy came and turned the lights off where we were eating and they were just staring at us eating this was at 1pm. I asked for a water never came. She brought my cousin 2 lemonades and a water. I was asked not to pay rudely cause she had to fix something on the bill that is an other story... anyways never told us she fixed it never came back we were there waiting for about 10 minutes until we checked again. We payed and left she never came. I felt like she was talking bad about us with an other costumer and an other employee at the bar. Everything was rude and uncomfortable. Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was at the Applebees on 80th and Bell.  Everything was great, a very enjoyable dining experience.  Today I met a friend from South Phx and recommended we go to an Applebees in her area.  What a difference a day makes.  We did get our menus promptly, but that's where the good service stopped.  I ordered the same item I did yesterday, bourbon street chicken & shrimp, my friend had bbq ribs with mac and cheese.  My chicken was dry, obviously over cooked, as were my shrimp and the crispy red potatoes were hard, and under cooked.   My friends order came out with mashed potatoes and we had to re order the mac and cheese.The ribs were dry, and obviously had been cook the day before.  (You can tell by the color of the pork, if its been reheated).  We finished what we could and waited another 20 minutes before our server came around.  We asked for the bill, another 15 minutes passed until we received that.  I should have read the previous reviews for this Applebees location.  I would not recommend this Applebees location to anybody.  BUT folks, lets remember, its not the name on the door, its the people who work behind the door.  Not all ApplebBees are as bad as this one.  For a good experience and good food and service, go to the one on 80th and Bell."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would. I only came here because we had a gift card but I would have rather not even had used it.  When we first walked in the hostess barely said hello. Not how many, not I'll be right with you. Once she did speak to us it took her another 10 minutes to bus our table.  Our server was nice. We put our orders in and it took about 15 minutes for 2 appetizers. The steak soup was disgusting. It had a weird smell and strange color. Out chips and salsa was definitely skimping. I ordered a side Cesar salad because they were out of Italian dressing. The salad literally had like 10 pieces of lettuce. I asked about the size and the response was \"it looks small because it's on a big plate, we're out of small ones\" mmmmk.  Once our food came they forgot 1 of our party of fives. It never even made it to the kitchen. They were gracious enough to remove it from the bill but his food took another 15 minutes or so.  The food was all cold. The mushrooms were clearly canned and not even warm and had a gray color to them.  Worst food ever and worst money ever spent. We asked if the cook was new since we saw a minimum of 5 other people send back food and our server said he had been there about 4 weeks and even hindering her from doing her job.  I didn't complain about the food since they already comped the burger and I already asked for Warner items and so many other people were sending back food, seemed pointless. Now that I think about it I should have just sent it all back and went somewhere else. What a waste of $60 for garbage food. But hey, my beer was good"}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience we had in years.  Coffee cold. Lemons brought for water already squeezed, Ribs were hard and dry, baked potato hard not cooked. I mean it's almost unbelievable.  Walked out !! Never again go to this joint!  I have never written a bad review for a restaurant but this place is terrible I had to convey to people ."}
{"text":"Tried car side to go for the first time tonight and it came out right when I pulled up! Even inside I've always had great service but I am defiantly impressed tonight with how quick the car side to go was!"}
{"text":"Bad food bad service!!they brought our appetizer too late after 30 minutes or so, food was cold! I didn't complain n start eating but my husband couldn't eat that frozen mash potato ask them to reheat it by the time they brought the food I was done with my  food ! N guess what I didn't have any water to swallow that nastiness!! N he never brought us drinks after we paid the bill he asked my husband ( not me and my father )if he wants some  drink to go!! Really?! Is this a jock?! We have been waiting thirsty the whole time now one drink to go n still not  apology?!Please close your restaurant"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our experience was very lacking tonight. The appetizer was brought out after we were eating the main dish... And only then because we asked. Both of our main dishes were lukewarm.. Not hot and they looked like they had been sitting for awhile. Ugh..... We won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"my wife and i have been to this place a few times and have not had a bad experience .service is good and they have military discount and thats what really will keep us going back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Applebee's location, and it was a busy Friday evening. I think our server worked hard and did his very best. I'd give him five stars for an amazing effort. :) However, I don't think they had enough people working or maybe people called in for the President's Day weekend?? Idk.....  Pros - The place was clean and the food was a good value. We ordered mozzarella sticks which were crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. My daughters Mac n Cheese was eaten quickly and with no complaints. My younger daughter ordered the chicken strips and they did a solid job there. Next, I had a side salad and the Tortilla soup. The tortilla soup really hit the spot! The salad was fresh, and nicely prepared.   Cons- Super busy with customers and although they tried -- it appeared like the staff couldn't keep up. For example, another server brought us our food and she gave us the wrong items -- but quickly got us the right plates. Our \"real server\" was running around constantly with drinks and other orders. I found this location to be loud and crowded - which we didn't mind at all - but some folks might.   Personally, I like the Applebee's in Henderson on Stephanie better. That location (in my experience) pays more attention to the customer and it isn't a \"rat race\" feeling. However, the food at this location was decent and the price is relatively cheap."}
{"text":"This location of Applebee's was disappointing.   We stopped in for a quick dinner.  It was during their happy hour (3-6pm) so some of the appetizers were 1/2 off.  We wanted to try their chicken quesadilla. It was full of chicken, bacon and cheese.  Actually this was probably the best part of dining here.    For our meal we split the chicken fajita rollup with french fries.   A long long time ago, this used to be my favorite thing to order here.   Boy have times changed.  It really wasn't great.  The french fries they served with it were horrible.  My body dehydrated after eating one because of all the salt they dumped on them.   I had to drink a lot water after one french fry. Needless to say I didn't eat anymore.   Service here really lacked.  I think our waiter/bartender just rolled out of bed.  There wasn't any sense of courtesy or personality.  Sorry Applebee's but I think you dropped the ball...  and it rolled away."}
{"text":"i was there to have lunch with my wife and the food was very disappointing. the steak was completely tasteless and the fries were rubbery. felt like they were cooked a day before. The server was not friendly at all and ignored us the whole time.Food arrived late and bad service.i dont remember the server's name. but it starts with a \"j\". will never be back there again."}
{"text":"Received Applebee's gift card. Upon arrival found they had a new menu. We ordered the green beans for appetizer and it was a very small portion and was served with an entirely mayo sauce that had no flavor. When we ordered they let us know the only gravy for their mashed potatoes is a stout gravy that they cannot sell you a side of - why on earth can a restaurant NOT part with a little gravy to go with a steak and mashed potato entree ??? And they have no other gravy choices on their menu for their mashed potato side. Very disappointed with the waitress 's explanation that the rules here are \"funny \" about the gravy- apparently it's made of gold, no wonder the appetizer dipping sauces are made of jar mayo !"}
{"text":"Nice bar, good staff, and tasty potstickers. Applebee's is neat and bright. I enjoy coming here to eat or have a drink, the place brings back good memories, much like driving past the old high school. You cannot go wrong here and it is family friendly."}
{"text":"Service was better than the food.  Food and Beer was served quickly.  It worked for a travel meal while on the read."}
{"text":"Slow service. Waitress kept forgetting my drink. Order chicken quesadilla  with almost no chicken."}
{"text":"2/$24 deal sucked! I got the Cajun shrimp pasta. Noodles were old and were like eating cardboard. Server had bad attitude when I told him my food was not good at all. Boneless chicken wings were good. That's the only + I can give this place. Thi is my second time eating here since moving to Laveen. I won't be returning. GARBAGE FOOD!"}
{"text":"I know it's an applebee's. but let me tell you Gavin the bartender ROCKS! His Margarita's are amazing and his service is even better! every time I eat there I love it. I usually get the three cheese chicken Penne but, I've gotten a few other things at other times. Like the fiesta Lime chicken mmm yummy. But, the  service at this particular applebee's is what puts it over the top! Keep on doing what ya do!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I just ate there today and not only were all our apps (the late night special is awesome) absolutely delicious, but the service was perfect! The host (Raymond) who greeted us was friendly and funny. Our server Diane was so kind, sweet and seemed to sincerely care about making sure we had a good dining experience. Even the management (who's name I was unfortunately unable to catch) was present and checked on us repeatedly to ensure our meals were good and what we wanted. Absolutely would recommend this restaurant to friends and family and we can't wait to come back for our next night out!"}
{"text":"Such a let down. I ordered boneless wings with ranch and got blue cheese, paid for extra celery with that and only got 3 pieces. Ordered artichoke chicken pasta with no bruschetta and it had bruschetta on it. The chicken was rubbery which means it was old (I'm a cook).  I ordered online n took it to go. Come on Applebee's. Your better than this."}
{"text":"Wow.. we came in and no one greeted us so we went to sit at the bar. Then the bar tender said the change over went bad sorry things r a little slow. We said no problem we r in no rush... soon to realize the bar tender was either high or wasted. He finally took our drink order but made horrible drinks.... stood at the computer for 10 min trying to put our order in. Kept acting like he was freaking out when there was no one at the bar. A bar tender who works there n was drinking all day came and served our friends there drinks. The bar tender brought our cold food... the manager kept coming out doing nothing. I asked the bartender for the check 3 times. He went to the computer. Printed my friends check not ours.. asked again. He went to the kitchen... then i got the manager who couldn't look me in the eye. No apology nothing. Just took apps off bill. She and the bartender will be the reason why the place goes under. Its not okay to be on the clock while on some sort of drugs or alchohol.. horrible"}
{"text":"We went in to get just desserts and both were delicious! We ordered the Butter Pecan Blondie & the Triple Chocolate Meltdown. The butter pecan dessert was served on a hot griddle which kept the cake hot the whole time & it went well with the ice-cream. The chocolate cake was also good .. Very chocolate-y & again that went well with the ice-cream.  The only couple of things that were off-putting were: the service - it took quite a while for someone to come around, so we figured we'd put the order in right away when we got drinks & also the table was so sticky! It was like it wasn't even cleaned with a clean rag.  Their happy hour menu looked really appealing - half off all appetizers & specials on their drinks. We'll probably be back for that."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Asked for a specific table,  was told we could get it when it became available and then told rudely that we couldn't have that table. Never coming to this location again. Had better service in the south side 24th St and baseline location."}
{"text":"Dinner and drinks the my middle girl! The food and drinks hit the spot!  Sat in the car at the community table and took pictures for the group next to us."}
{"text":"I come to this location every so often to get their 2 for 25 promo deal with my girlfriend. We usually get Roberto as our server who is always so nice to us and makes sure he provides us a great visit. I appreciate the constant check up to make sure we are okay but he doesn't do it annoyingly which is good. Roberto quickly soon figured out that I am constant with my request for refills on my drink and being that it is my biggest pet peeve in a restaurant is when I have to wait for a while, he just went ahead and brought me two glass of my drink which was very good! We got boneless barbecue wings for appetizers which I think is the better choice of the spinach dip, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. They have good mango lemonade which I prefer over the mango ice tea. As for the main course, I got the 4 cheese Mac n cheese with the honey pepper chicken tenders, which my girlfriend also got. Now this dish is good, but personally I think it also tastes a bit too sweet. What makes up for it is for the promo deal, there's a good amount of serving to get you full without that feeling of an over priced meal. To be honest I enjoyed the boneless barbecue wings more than my actual main course meal. The atmosphere of the place is like any Applebee's. A bit dark but still a good vibe. It does get a bit crowded at nights and it just feels really packed but I've only really had Roberto serve me most of the times and I come for the good service. I've visited once with a different host but it didn't really do it for me."}
{"text":"Local residents in a small town 30 minutes south west of downtown Phoenix are ecstatic about the new changes that have been taking place at their local Applebee's in Laveen, Arizona. Super Official News stopped by the restaurant this weekend to investigate further what's making this hot spot so popular.  Restaurant manager Paul Horner explained just a few of the exciting changes that have been happening. \"Every Friday and Saturday while we have our live Jimmy Buffet tribute band or gangster rap playing at full volume over the speakers from 3pm-2am, during breaks in the music, I've been letting my 8-year old son bang on his drum set that I just bought him for his birthday last month,\" Horner said. \"We also just got two new microwaves to cook all the food that is on the menu. We named them 'Chef 1 and 'Chef 2, Horner laughs. \"Preparing your steak how you want it will now be easier than ever! We also changed out the drainage system around the bar area so it doesn't smell like urine and human feces as much anymore.\"  Local resident Michael Spielman says he just loves the new changes at the Applebee's in Laveen. \"They repaved the parking lot and I even heard they added new insulation to the roof of the building. Also, they have installed new air conditioning vents above every table that blow out the coldest air you've ever felt in your entire life. It's like traveling to Antarctica, but you're actually in Laveen! How cool is that, no pun intended,\" Spielman laughs. \"Also I noticed there is more free mints and toothpicks when I walk in. Rip-roaring good times have come to Laveen!\"  Gerald Byrnes who has been a server since the restaurant opened two years ago gave us some inside information on the appetizers and beverages. \"No longer will our cold rubbery cheese sticks and alcoholic beverages that have no alcohol in them take an hour to arrive at your table. We have cut all our times down to 50 minutes or less or you get another alcoholic beverage with no alcohol in it free of charge! How awesome is that!\"  Horner was more than happy to explain their new menus and additional usages. \"Instead of 7-9 different menus per person we are now giving each diner 19 different menus of various sizes and colors to browse through. It will all be the same food but now just more spread out to make things more fun,\" Horner said. \"Also to keep our customers safe, we are upgrading the menus to a type of plastic recently invented by NASA that has corners that can cut through glass. If the need ever comes up to fight off an attacker, our menus will work better than a machete.\"  Assistant manager Joyce Barth explained some of the other exciting new changes that have been made to improve the restaurant. \"Our greeters and servers will no longer speak urban slang and other forms of language that make it difficult to understand when trying to order food,\" Barth says. \"We have put each and every one of our employees through a rigorous 36-week course on how to properly speak to a customer in a language that can be understood by both the young and old.\" Barth continued, \"When greeted at the front, no longer will you hear the familiar shouting of, 'Oh lawd, it's you folks again! Well git on in here and I'll get your seats right now! Not sure what's good right now for sitting, lemme check real quick for yall. You hang tight and chill, I be back after I git this figured out. I'll hit up my girlfriend Yolanda, she's one of the dish washers but she always has the down low on seats that aren't already taken up by some other fools'. This will now be replaced by, 'Hello and welcome to Applebee's. Would you like a table or a booth?'\"  Horner told Super Official News that because of all these great new changes at his restaurant, unfortunately there will come sacrifices. \"In addition to raising prices on all of our food* because of Obamacare and firing employees so we don't have to provide them with health care, we will also be forced to raise prices to cover all the costs of these new and exciting changes. But I think everyone in Laveen will agree that it's worth it the next time they come in for lunch or dinner or just to get a drink with no alcohol in it.\"  From Applebee's in Laveen to your family: We know in Laveen you have no options for good food so when you're starving, and you have no food left in your house and the grocery stores are closed, head on over to Applebee's. We'll make sure you have the worst f*cking dining experience ever!"}
{"text":"Im sort of seeing why this place is ranked so low. Our server was nice and I understand he was covering several other tables in our area where we were seated. Buuut our food took so long! Our Spinach & artichoke dip had burnt cheese. We sat in a 4 person booth with a high chair at the end. The table was not long but every time he asked if he could clear our dishes he expected us to hand it to him. Worst of all, we asked for an extra spoon he handed us a dirty one (visible food residue) on accident. Pls check what you are giving your customers! Performance is sloppy. I won't be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot of work to start off I do come here a bit and its always cold and it would be nice if the place had more room fell like I am going to run stuff over as I walk.  I am going keep this one short I do wish they gave more and were less stingy but oh well I mean its a sports bar and the prices are mid priced so they pull one over us."}
{"text":"Lmao service here is a joke. Appetizer came out WITH my meal and looked like it had been sitting out. Visiting here from Florida can't wait to go back at this point"}
{"text":"I ordered appetizers and drinks with a friend, which were great, but the service SUCKED. Kyle was our \"waiter\", and I don't know what drugs that kid is on, but he needs to share with his customers if he would like to be deemed SLIGHTLY tolerable. He didn't put our drink order in until we were served our appetizers (I was wondering why he kept asking me if I wanted lemon in a water I didn't have), AND he kept relaying our drink order incorrectly to the bartender. He would come to \"check\" on us with, \"is everything OK? \" only to rudely turn around and walk away before we could get a word in. He did this literally 5 times.  Unfortunately, I have had comparable service at this same location so I doubt this will be an option for me in the future."}
{"text":"Nothing was good in this neighborhood. Probably the most depressing place I've ever been to. Just like when you're throwing a party and no one shows up. Or when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland, but you're going to the dentist. I never expect much from chains, but this one needed more work done than kardashian. Everyone working there seemed like they were not having a good day or just not wanting to be there.  The food wasn't the disappointing part because you know what you're getting from a chain. The bummer was the service... well lack of.  I was going to take it to go, but decided to sit at the bar... was that a mistake. Ordered a beer and there was more foam on it than a mattress. Beer ended up spilling because of the overflow of foam and I asked for a napkin to clean it up. Had to ask a 2nd time and clean it up myself which is fine, but I felt like a nuisance even though I was a customer. I could go on for about 40 days and 40 nights about everything else, but I'll just never go to an Applebee's instead... especially in AZ. Still made sure I tipped 25% despite the service because i felt bad even though I didn't have the best experience."}
{"text":"Isabelle is a wonderful bartender everyone needs to see her here. Very friendly very attentive"}
{"text":"They have a Blue Lives Matter flag hung up which is a plus. Here in Arizona, we respect and are very grateful for our men and women in uniform. Rachel our server was very helpful, and the 8oz steaks weren't too bad. Between four adults, our bill came out to about 80 bucks. One of the few places to go in the area for a late night bite to eat."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had. Had to wait 25 minutes before they came to get my drink and another 40 mins for my food. And all I ordered was boneless wings. Never coming back to this location again. Deserves zero stars."}
{"text":"Sitting at Applebee's right now they brought out our food 2 burgers and southwest steak salad I couldn't believe my eyes the soughtwest salad  did not look anything like the picture it was so laugh able I sent it back no manager came over to apologize I'm sitting here watching my family eat writing this never again will I come here oh yeah they charge $12 for that salad that was worth &3"}
{"text":"I don't know what happen at this Applebee's. Service was not the greatest. After we got seated it took about 5 minutes to see our server. There were no condiments on the tables. We even had to to asked for sugar. The server didn't asked us if needed some. The burgers that were order were not the greatest either. We order the Triple Bacon Burgers. I don't think that there was any bacon in the burger like it was scribe to us. We asked for ketchup and it came fast and then there wasn't enough for one order of fries that we order. Also were we were seated they started to move tables around us. Then is when we got faster service. There must been a large party coming because we were rush to get going. Ah the larger the group the more money and let get this party of two out as soon a possible... This place has gone down hill on food and service since the last time we been there. They have lost our business."}
{"text":"The Thai Shrimp Salad is spicy, but very good.  The restaurant was very clean.  Everyone was very friendly. The $3 Margarita was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I was previously more than happy with my experience but coming again my experience was not great at all. First of all it took 25 minutes to be seated even though they said it would be 10. No big deal, I wasn't in a rush anyway. Secondly when we were seated and the server came, she gave no friendly intro nothing, straight to the \"what can I get for you.?\"...(uhmmm who are you?) I asked for a margarita for olives on the side. I got the margarita 15 minutes later no olives. And she wouldn't come often, so I let it go, unhappy, but let it go. The people who I came with asked for the quencher iced tea which looks GREAT in the menu with fresh fruit and all, what we got was a plain cup, no fruit. So why pay more for this than a regular tea? Anyway. Ordered my steak with steamed broccoli and pasta. The steak looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. The broccoli was SUPER DRY and the cheese on the pasta was already hardening. I mean..really?? This was the most unappetizing, unappealing dish I have ever ordered! So anyway I order a second margarita with olives on the side AGAIN. This time I get them but one of them looks like it's rotting away. When we asked for the check and boxes it took nearly 15-20 minutes for the check and she had to ask how many boxes THREE times before the manager David came and took care of that. Which was greatly appreciated but the manager shouldn't have to worry about something so simple like getting a customer boxes.  I'm sure he has bigger things to worry about like, great food and service. Which in my case, was a fail this time around. Hopefully if ever do decide to come back, things are different. Anyway, I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Received amazing service once I left the bar area...traditionally applebees good food and drinks, just avoid the female bartenders, unless you really want to be ignored."}
{"text":"The disappointment and frustration I just experience was at its all time high. Decide to give Applebees Whitney way location one last chance considering it's so close to home. Should have just drove to the East Side of town matter of fact next time I will drive on the East Side of tow if I'm craving Applebees ever again. Waited 15 min for my child and I to be seat to only wait 20 min for no one to take my drink order nor food order. I left especially after the hostess started taking people orders who came in after us. Hugh disappointment!!! I will not be going back because that place need major changes in how it's ran as a business!! My previous views was over a yr new staff that need a lot more training!!"}
{"text":"I have a ladies group that get together once a week and we sometimes go to dinner. This place is by far our favorite pick!   the waitress is always friendly and we get drink refills without asking( Imagine that!)   Love Love Love Applebee's on Bell !! Its a fantastic location for everyone to find . just say Applebee's on I-17 & Bell  and no one gets lost.   Thank you Applebees!"}
{"text":"This place used to be fun to go to when I was younger, it is not the same as I remember. And the food is just soso."}
{"text":"I can see the average recent reviews are quite negative.   We needed a change of pace so after avoiding for quite some time we gave this a chance.  Kevin behind the bar was great.   He was doing the best he could with a location corporate clearly forgot about.   He was friendly, working hard, keeping behind the bar clean and provided us great service.  The $1 long islands were a nice surprise too.  We had the app platter and some wings.  Hard food to screw up, and it was all pretty good.  Overall it was a fine experience.   I hope corporate reinvests here with a bigger budget for Kevin to hire more and better staff."}
{"text":"We were seated within 5 minutes, just in time to order 1/2 price appetizers.    For some reason, our table didn't  have the \"pay at your table\"/Game-play things.  I asked for one and they quickly complied.  (I hate waiting/paying for a check.)  They dropped it off and informed us there is a charge to play the games (I knew this already as I like to play the quizes-obviously i dont know my spouse very well....i always guess the wrong thing, BAHAWAAA)  We ordered the appetizer combo-Happy Hour 50% off.  It was 5:45pm.  Correct price on the check (yippy)and Totally delicious.  They even brought the correct bleu cheese dip. So many places get that wrong but not here.  We ordered the 2/$20 whiskey burger with fries.  My husband thought the meat needed more seasoning.  I took a bite and I thought the combination of the whiskey bbq steak sauce, crunchy onions, bacon, and cheese was incredible.  With all the mixture of flabors, the meat doesn't need a great deal of extra \"umph.\"  Ehat I liked about the burger was the little bit of \"crisp\" surrounding the meat pattie  As for my meal.  The chicken with white sauce covered with crunchy onions, baked tator and i got a \"premium\" side of bacon mac-n- cheese (at an extra charge.)  I think I like the mac-n-cheese the best.  Very cheesy with a creamy sauce, add in the cruch of the bacon-home run.  As for the chicken....not sure how they managed it but it was both rubbery and moist.  I took most of it home for leftovers.  \"Lunch tomorrow!\"  Not sure if for me or my dog....depends how good it is.  But hey, the dog eats anything...including my shoes and hair brush. :)  The waiter we had was awesome.  Did everything right.  Checked on us often but not too often to be a pest.  Was friendly without being flirty.  Sometimes Im in the mood to be \"chatty\" but tonight we were in a hurry.  It was time to bowl so he quickly brought boxes.  As he was bagging up the meal, I was paying for the meal.  Multi-tasking.....I love it.    Overall, 4 stars.  Only due to the rubbery chicken.  No real complaints and we had a wonderful meal.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I gave this place one star because the waitress was pretty cool. We had a giftcard so we wanted to use it before it got lost. I ordered the Southwest Jalepano Burger. The burger I got didnt look anything like the burger they have on their menu. Looks like they put some jalepanos in a jar of gelatin or something then when someone orders this burger they just pour it on the patty. Im sorry but for a ten dollar burger I couldve went to Burger King and got there Angry Whopper meal for a few dollars less and it probably would've tasted better. Also the fries were at least a day old. They were so stale and hard. They also skimped on the fries. My philosophy is if you can see the plate behind the fries then they didnt give you enough. After I ate I was still hungry. My wife wasnt happy with her meal either. She got some kind've wrap but it looked like some day old thing that you can get at Vons or some place like that. The only reason why we came back here was because of the gift card. We wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Bartender is one of the best there is!  Very personable, fit for the job.  I previously had a bad experience with the food, however, tonight I went out on a limb and tried the boneless chicken wings.  I'm extremely picky with my chicken wings and flavors - this place hit the spot.  As recommended, the BBQ wings are the best.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"food was terrible and burnt  waited a long time when place was empty i work across the street and would always refer people here well not anymore waitress was rude brought all of appetizers and dinner out 2min apart from each other, and 5min after brought us our bill. my husband and i felt extremely rushed and not welcomed. they still charged us for burnt nasty food we did not eat and there was dust or dirt not only in my malibu drink but inside my ice cube. what a waste of time and money don't go here, not worth the crappie service, dirty cups, and burnt food. i will be filing a corporate complaint our waitress was alexandria g.  tb#93 check#8883-470848"}
{"text":"My husband went to pick up a take out order last night.  He checked in at the bar and the waitress took his name and decided to go on break before checking on our order.  Several people came and went with their take out order but my husband had to wait until the waitress came back from her break 15 minutes later.  When my husband spoke to the manager, she informed him that the waitress was entitled to a break.  Completely unprofessional.  The service at the restaurant went downhill.  Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!. They cannot cook a well done steak. Waited forever for our order. The idiot girl couldn't even remember I had a 2nd drink. If I could I would leave a ZERO star rating. Shut this place down!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Spinach artichoke dip, ALWAYS MY FAVORITE. Wonderful alcoholic beverages to choose from. Haha, never fails me at Applebee's. :)"}
{"text":"I am not normally an Applebee's fan but this time I decided to give it a try. I called to carry out and was pleasantly surprised they had curbside pickup. Very nice feature. The gal taking my order was very knowledgable about the menu, professional and friendly. I arrived around the time estimate they gave me and they were out to deliver my food right on time. Again super friendly and fast  great customer service!  Food was really good. My hubby had the sirloin and baked potato and was happy. I had fiesta lime chicken which was a nice choice.  Overall very happy with the experience and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"One star for Horrible Customer Service. Was a long time customer and will never be back to this location because of your horrible customer service including rude servers. The server told us she was not trained in customer service she's just a server. Wtf applebees should have higher standards for their servers. I'll take my money elsewhere. All the manager says... I'll talk to her, maybe you should've trained her when she was hired/did a personality check."}
{"text":"This location has become a loud Mexican disco.  No longer a family oriented restaurant.  The music is so loud we had to shout to hear each other.  Disappointing as we went frequently.  Time to find another place!  If you go to this location, take ear plugs!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Terrible food...terrible waitress.... dirty... I used to like Applebee's.  Not anymore. Will never go back to this location or any others for that matter."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Applebees and have been to and will definitely come back here. The service was great and quick and the food was very delicious . The staff were very friendly ."}
{"text":"What can you say about Applebee's, they are all pretty much the same food wise IMO. The food is standard, you know what to expect if you've eaten here before. Inconsistency is with service. You never know what you're going to get. I've always had a good experience with the service at this location. So I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We were seated within minutes.  Awesome waiter.  Took our orders and everything came out correctly.  Couldn't ask for a nicer evening."}
{"text":"Being in the restaurant business I understand times are tough. Any type of promotion to bring in guests that is feasible would give the \"edge\" to a particular business. Frequenting this particular applebees I felt like I just walked into club applebees. The volume is way over the top. Service was compatible to a crowded bar with one bartender to serve. I sat at a table to wait 10 minutes before even being greeted by my server. With the music it came as no sunrise that the food order came out totally incorrect. After trying to stomach through the wrongly prepared item, I had to regrettably send it back. After 2 minutes it came back corrected with the quality parallel to Taco Bell. The identity is in question, the food is a pathetic excuse for a full service franchise, and service that I could find in a dive bar. Highly disappointed in this franchise as of late. Past three visits to different area locations have ended in similar fashion. So sad."}
{"text":"Because it's a chain, Applebee's is hard to mess up.   We stopped in before heading back to the airport on our way out of Las Vegas. Our waiter was wonderful, the service was quick, and the food was tasty.   Plus, they have these awesome touch screens at every table where you can order appetizers and desserts, and pay your bill (if you're using a card)! How handy!"}
{"text":"Applebee's is an outstanding restaurant.  I go a lot of the time and I have not had one bad experience yet. I usually get one of the Neighborhood  burgers. They are very high-quality and cooked and seasoned  well. I would really recommend Applebee's."}
{"text":"Previous 4 star review has changed. Went in for the 2 for 20 lunch which we always get. The normal burger is least expensive burger on menu. The new menu has upgraded to a more expensive burger. We wanted the less expensive burger. Waiter said no way. What. How dumb"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to come here for lunch. My waiter was friendly as he waited on me and kept returning frequently to refill my water glass. I ordered off the lunch menu and my food was delicious and not expensive.  While I ate, I was in perfect view of a TV on SportsCenter which I liked. Too bad there were no subtitles."}
{"text":"Service is ok.  A 1 1/2\" head on a beer though is NOT a \"perfect pour\" in my opinion!  Not at all happy about that & this location is the only one that uses this excuse.  And bring back the red jalapeno poppers PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices on weekdays and friendly staff. Food is what you'd expect from an Applebee's."}
{"text":"Place is nice food is so-so but it's no place for kids under 12 years of age I would not come back to location just because there are a lot of kids here. This place has ghetto trash here noisy as heck"}
{"text":"Love the people at this location. Always super friendly and helpful and we live right around the corner from here. However, whenever we order steak here we NEVER get the right cook of the steak. Today was my husbands birthday and we did a curbside order and normally I don't complain but the steak was well done instead of medium rare like we both ordered. Really hope they can get that part down because we really like this location but I am pretty disappointed today."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I don't like super-chain \"grills\"; I feel like the menu is too broad for them to serve decent food that isn't super greasy and overly salty. Applebee's wasn't my first choice for lunch today, but I went along with it anyway and was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed my dish. It would have been a 4-star experience before I tried the items on the sampler plate that my date ordered.   I ordered the Margarita Queso Chicken and Green Goddess Wedge Salad off the take two menu. Other than the little bit of browning on the lettuce (hey, we're at Applebee's) it was really good. Still crisp, and the bacon and pecans added a good crunch. It was served with an avocado ranch that was decent, if I go again, I'd order it with a vinaigrette. My first few bites of the chicken really let me down, the thin edges were way burnt and just covered in cheese, but as I got to the meatier sections, it ended up being a juicy and pretty flavorful piece of chicken. The Spanish-style rice it was served on was good too. I finished the entire plate.  My guy got the tomato basil soup, which was surprisingly tasty- it had croutons and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top. I would consider ordering it when I come again. I was not a fan of the rest of his meal, the trio appetizer plate; the boneless chicken wings weren't a good flavor, and the meat in the quesadilla towers were questionable. I didn't try the mozzarella sticks or the fries he ordered on the side, but they looked standard.   Service wasn't spectacular in any way, but it certainly wasn't bad. I would probably be a little less hesitant to visit Applebee's again in the future."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.   Better than expected after reading reviews.  Service excellent, food good, building clean.  Prices reasonable.  Hope they stay open.  Will come back."}
{"text":"We arrived and the hostess ignored us. When she finally sat us down at our table, she just walked away. We waited another 15 minutes to order and now it has been over 30 minutes and NO FOOD! Never will I come here again!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went for a nice dinner and instead I came home angry at the service she was bad, rude to us just because we were wearing workout clothes, didn't ask us if we wanted more drinks, when she brought our food didn't told us the plate was hot, they have the tablet to pay by your sell and instead of telling us if we wanted something else she put the bill for us to pay and leave  She had ponytail,dark skin, medium size, I don't remember her name but she look on her 30s and it was from 7:30pm to 9:20 pm on the left side of the restaurant don't go with her bad bad bad service with her"}
{"text":"Disappointed menu changed. Stay away from ordering the sirloin steak. On a recent visit my steak was very tough and inedible. Informed our server but no alternative or a re-do was offered.  The tastiest item on my plate were the green beans!"}
{"text":"It's your typical Applebees in regards to the menu. Basic selection, decent prices, etc. The service however is terrible.  We had what looked to be a small child seat us and he must have asked us three times how are night was before we got to the table. Maybe he was nervous? Then our waiter kneeled down next to our table and told us how he was also a chef a few nights a week here so he \"knew everything\"... Impressive!  He forgot to grab us napkins when we asked for them. He brought out some of our dishes before others. Not a fan of this location. Next time we're by campus we'll visit a different place."}
{"text":"Once again, it amazing how Applebee's love making people wait to be seated with 2 small benches (maybe for 4or5 people only)  but yet I see 4 open tables in bar area and obour 5or6 open table though out the restaurant so I ask the so called host why we can not be seated and she tells me ? \" because it's to much for the servers to handle ??? WTF is this ? Are you kidding me , god forbid they work a full section. .. what a joke, make customers wait just so the SO CALLED WORKERS done have to work .. what a joke but good for Chili's because we left and that's where we are now :-)"}
{"text":"Can I give this place a -5!!!???? Seriously .. Nothing disgusts me more than cleanliness of a restaurant!!!!! Thursday - 10pm : We never really eat here, we figured it was the closest and American food sounded good at the time.  Hostess greeted us and sat us promptly. Our server, Elizabeth G, took about 5 mins to greet us and get our drink orders. To start with we ordered White Peach Sangria, Iced Tea, Spinach Dip, and Wonton Tacos (took advantage of their happy hour). Then for main courses I ordered the Cedar Salmon and Full Rack of Ribs for him, replaced with Onion Rings with side of ranch. Fianc√© never received his Iced Tea. She offered to bring us more napkins, 20 mins later, no napkins. Water were never refilled unless we asked. Few red flags from the beginning.  We were actually enjoying our meals... and for dessert, fianc√© had asked for a root beer float. Which wasn't on the menu, but we thought wouldn't hurt to ask because they had rootbeer and they had ice cream. She said she can do it.  She came out with the rootbeer and bill. She said she didn't charge us for the rootbeer..  We looked over the bill and I went from \"ok\" to impatient. We got charged the tea we never got, a glass of Cabernet, burger sliders AND their happy hour prices were not applied on our bill. Took her 10-15 mins before coming back to our table and by that time he was close to finishing the root beer float... Here's where it gets disgusting ..  We found a piece of leaf/salad and a piece of washed up chicken!!   Better believe she was told of what we found and what she needs to correct. Came back with the \"corrected bill\" AND that was STILL wrong!!!! Took her 3 tries to correct our bill... So called \"manager\" on shift did not once bother going to our table! Apologizing on her behalf, offer to pay for the disgusting rootbeer, comp anything, kiss our asses ---anything really to help fix the situation! We saw her multiple of times to override the server's mistakes.. We did NOT see her on the floor, doing what any manager should be doing-- checking what the hell is going on in your restaurant.  You would think with all the overrides she had to do she'd have the audacity to come over apologize for anything!!   We were even given a hard time for wanting our receipt when leaving... THE RECEIPT!  Henderson Applebee's PLEASE GIVE RECOGNITION FOR YOUR MISTAKES!!!   I WILL NEVER AGAIN TAKE ANYONE, ESPECIALLY MY FAMILY, HERE!!!  IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FILTHY, POORLY MANAGED RESTAURANT.. THIS IS THE WINNER!"}
{"text":"From the 20 minute beverage wait to the very unprofessional waitress this is one Applebees I would not recommend . Though the food itself was great, it is the service that made me review this place.  My wife and I were lucky enough that the manager was on the floor and walked up to us because we were thirsty and hungry.  She took our drinks down and happily ran to the bar to get our beverages about 3 minutes later, she came out with our appetizers. Our original waiter then passed by us and commented on the fact that we just then started to eat our appetizers he said and I quote  \" you're just now eating that, that's crazy\" as he walked away. We got our food from a different waiter and enjoyed it very much. About 10 minutes into our meal the original waiter walks up to us with the receipt in hand and leaves it on the table. Unbelievable because  I wasn't even halfway done with my meal. So we finished our meal sat there for a good 10 minutes with our \"waiter\" not coming to collect we just walked towards the entrance with the receipt and another staff member called the waiter so we can pay.  Wasn't the hospitality I expected from an Applebees."}
{"text":"Love this place! We are regulars here and most of the time they already know what we want to drink. Calie is one of the best up there! Great food great service! The wonton Tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"The worst service on earth. Every time I go I'm there for at least 2 hours. Just waiting and waiting and waiting. Definitely not worth it. I get it it's just apple bees, it's not pampas or Texas de Brazil lmao. HOW EVER. If I have to wait 20 minutes for a damn strawberry lemonade I might as well make it my damn self. shooot! Burger King is right next door I should just go there. Hey but the upside is that they're pretty friendly. They're just slow. If Walmart were a restaurant it would be the apple bees on Craig. Case closed. Smh"}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible dry food I wouldn't recommend!  I don't know how they are still open! Literally I am going to Taco Bell where I can spend $5.00 and be much happier and better experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the boy and the GF to enjoy dinner with friends on a Friday.  For a Friday evening the wait for a table for five was not bad at all.  All was well, until the server came to take our order and in a snarky sort of way was leaning against a post while taking our order.  Then a game was made out of how many times we would thank our server and he would offer nothing in reply.  The saving grace was the gregarious nature of the manger who served the food.  The food was as Applebee's does....A-OK."}
{"text":"Hubby and I dine here FREQUENTLY for half off appetizers and their delicious salads!!!!! Never had a issue here of the 30 something times we've been here. The waitresses are always kind and doing their job well. Food is delicious and service is on point. I like coming here."}
{"text":"What more can i say it's Applebee's, nothing crazy, they have a few TV's and a decent bar area with a few booths around it. Not sure if it's just me but I always feel like they're understaffed at this location, although the waiters try to make it work you are still sitting waiting for them to even come around.  Not a place I'd recommend unless you're looking for just a spot to have a few beers and appetizers to watch a game or just hang out.   If you're looking for similar environment with a bit better food try chili's across the street."}
{"text":"I had a gift card for Applebee's,  so we went for lunch...the host that seated us immediately knew we were from Hawaii,  his mom grew up in pearl city,  very nice young man,  made us feel right at home.  Service was great,  food awesome,  good variety of all kinds of food,  reasonable prices,  as we were leaving,  the nice young man called us Auntie and Uncle (hawaii local style of showing respect), asked if the food was \"ono\" IT WAS!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, service a bit slow, greaters I found not overly friendly, food and portions a decent size.  Nice variety in the menu."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect.  The food is not great by any means, but the service is great and so is the happy hour specials.  I will occasionally walk to here to meet some friends for happy hour because it is so close but I prefer a few other places around the area."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on Sunday, March 3rd and it was AWFUL. I had the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, which was oily and very bland. The shrimp smelled a little off, and the garlic bread was stale. My boyfriend had chicken strips with fries. The fries were soggy and over-salted, and the chicken strips were still partially frozen. Our waitress was less than attentive, only refilling our drinks after we waived her down. The atmosphere was poor - it was very loud, very crowded.  I've had better experiences at McDonalds. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Spare your tummy and skip this resturant."}
{"text":"The first time I went the food was hot and delicious, but the second time we went I got some cold ass food because the waitress was to busy socializing with the other employees. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"So very disappointed..we have eaten here before and the food was ok...ordered the baby back ribs which came with fries and cole slaw...the ribs literally tasted like a non meat substitute...the slaw was ok..bottom line...i will never eat there again...very creepy and very questionable foods!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's wonderful grandfather treated us for lunch one day. This is his hang out spot. I wasn't very hungry so I just had mozzarella sticks. We sat at the bar so i had my usual vodka cranberry with a splash of pineapple juice which was made just right."}
{"text":"Disappointed that i found a hair in my food and as pleasant as i May have been with my findings, they didn't comp anything, not even my appetizer or my beer! They were apologetic and provided good customer service but i will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often with my daughter after gym class. AGAIN...how do you rate a chain restaurant like Applebee's, you know what youre gonna get. This one at Boca Park is always quiet and friendly perfect for doing some late homework and a glass of wine.  The food reminds me of how kids eat.  I like it here..quiet, never crowded and great service, I don't know if that's good for them, but great for me:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.  Music is blasting super loud, probably why when I called in 2 orders of wings the take out person messed it up.  I was on hold for 7 minutes, figured it was just unusually busy for a Wednesday night.  She asked bone in or bone out.... I clearly said bone in.  Boneless wings are not wings in my eyes.  Nobody came out to curbside pickup, walked in to find out she thought I said boneless, and then told me \"well you said boneless so it's gonna be a longer\".  Done with this place.  This happens way to often....I like Applebee's food so I keep giving it a chance.  No more, family it and I will never return."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this restaurant. Dirty beer glasses, sullen server, slow service and wrong order served! Only myself to blame, with so many other great choices nearby I should  know better."}
{"text":"Typical Applebee's.  Nothing spectacular.  The waitress was great and didn't mind our obnoxious girls night out.  The food though was a bit to be desired.  I had the app platter and it was so greasy! My stomach was not happy at all.   I doubt I'll be back to this location any time soon, but I'm not ruling the chain or just yet."}
{"text":"Very unpleased .... Service was ridiculously not to par ... Hardly any people eating but took almost an hour to get the food... Waitress messed up both orders ... Then messed up the bill uncountable times first undercharged my self then fixed the bill to over charge both of us ... Then said there was MORE TO PAY and \"which one of you is gunna pay the extra $7\" ... I was floored and very upset asked to speak to a manager who seemed to be completely out of it???? Offered us a $5 coupon off NEXT order of a two entree purchase  you have to be kidding me ... Why would i give you guys MORE money smh. I was extremely displeased would not recommend to anyone. Didn't even take the coupon is was so irritated.... DONT GO THERE ITLL RUIN A GOOD DAY"}
{"text":"Second times is a charm.   I revisited the place of my previous 2 for $20 salt lick with my gift card in hand, ready to give this location a second chance.   I love a deal so I went for the 2 for $20 to go again. Now if this had been a horrible experience I would have no one to blame but myself for trying the to- go again. Luckily for me, by changing up what I ordered I got a pretty good meal.   Out went the sizzling burnt shriveled chicken with salt lick potato chunks and dry pasta. In came the Mozzarella Sticks, Cajun Shrimp Pasta and the 7 oz House Sirloin.   They got it right this time. The mozzarella sticks were good, not the mozzarella logs they used to sell on the strip but well seasoned and we got 12 of them. The sauce was cold but 6 secs in the microwave took care of that. The cajun shrimp pasta was a good size portion of well cooked pasta, light sauce and about a dozen shrimp. The 7 oz house sirloin was one of the best steaks that I have had in a while. It was cooked to a perfect medium and served with mashed potatoes and veggies.   The food was great for $20 bucks and there was only a 5 minute wait from when I pulled into the to go parking space until I got my order."}
{"text":"Service and Food was amazing! KRISTINA is an awesome server.Great suggestions, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a good time with family or friends!  Lemon Parmesan Shrimp! Just perfect!"}
{"text":"We keep trying. This store is close so we continue to give them another chance. Some one once told me\" if you make the same mistake over and over, either you are not smart enough to fix it or you just don't care.\" It's time for someone to figure out the constant mistakes this store makes or find a new manager who can. Customer service is not that hard."}
{"text":"Horrible service and ignored several times by the server.  Food was prepared wrong. Cold queso.. should have went to Chili's"}
{"text":"Terrible. Takes 20 minutes to get a soda. Probably the worst service I have experience in the past few years. Had to just get up an leave. Avoid."}
{"text":"Ill start off by saying the staff was pretty nice but that's about all they had going for them. The food here is terrible! The steak was like eating rubber and the fries were extremely hard. It is like this literally every time i have gone in to Applebee's. I asked for a refill on my water and they i waited about 5-10 minutes before having to ask again. On top of the horrible food, i had a gift card that i tried to use, but they gave it back to me and said there was a zero balance on it. This was news to me since, the last time i used it there, they gave it back to me and didnt bother to tell me it was all used up! the only reason i even went to this restaurant was because i had the gift card. i never would have wasted my money on that terrible food."}
{"text":"They don't clean the plates , they give you food in nasty dirty plates it's awful i used to love apples bees now they decrease a lot in quality"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't review a \"Family\" restaurant like Appleby's but my family including my granddaughter had a delightful dinner. Jocelyn did a great job serving and the rest of the staff was very welcoming. The mgr even stopped by to thank us fir coming and make sure all was well."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to try the 2 for 20 menu the sirloin steak has now been added but it is actually part of the 2 for 25 menu a little false advertising. The waitress let us mix and match so I could get the steak and my daughter could have the 3 cheese penne. You could see that the managers were a little more hands on then I remember which is a good thing you could see that they were trying to stay on top of service."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!! Service was great.  We left and ordered Chinese to pick up. Nuff said!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent for an  Applebees. Bartender was a somewhat overly flamboyant gay dude but he was ok. He seemed to stir up bar drama with the wait staff. Other patrons seemed to enjoy his drinks so whatever. It's applebees so the microwaved food is pretty predictable so stick with what you know. Patrons ran the entire spectrum to include an 85 year old white guy regular sitting at the bar gumming down a dry ass steak. This placed lived up to it's neighbood bar identity as I sat next to the aforementioned geezer, some young mexican dude drinking coors light like water, a 30 something black female with a bad wig and petulant stare and the two slightly past their primes but sort of holding it together white women. It's America baby, good times."}
{"text":"We come here frequently as its one of the last choices for dinner out in Elyria.  Today, my son and I stopped in for lunch.  We had the spinach and artichoke dip,  the Chicken Cavatappi and the chicken tenders platter on the 2 for $20 menu. The food was excellent especially the Cavatappi. A great deal for the price!   The only reason for the 4 stars on today's visit was the waitress.    I had to ask for my water twice and when i asked for a lemon again as it was forgotten,  she was not very nice about it."}
{"text":"Tonight I was super hungry and wanted a well cooked meal, I live close and decided this was the place to go. I didn't know I would be disappointed. I walked in and was seated immediately with my 4 other family members! Our server, Kyle, quickly took our drink orders which was nice. Two parties are then seated on Kyle's side, one party with 3 people and another with 6. Kyle then takes our order perfectly . My mom orders a margarita. So far, so good. We had a long wait for our food and the party of 3 people had got so tired of waiting, they left. He didn't get to introduce himself or get their drink orders! After a long wait, we finally got our food! But one thing was missing... my moms margarita. He \"forgot\" about it. The food was worth waiting for! It was delicious! When ready to leave, I asked for my check. I hand him cash. He came back and handed me a bag for my boxes but had not given me back my change. Maybe he \"forgot\"... The change was well over 25% and was not well deserved. I understand if someone says \"keep the change\" but I did not and was expecting to leave the right deserved tip. Overall, the food is delicious but the service was terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and not to busy on a Sunday night.  They have a new drink special out with black berries, I recommend it.  Every table has the electric ordering service so it's very little communication with the staff.  Overall a great dinner there."}
{"text":"Bad experience.  I found hair in my salad bowl.  I informed the waiter,  he apologized, and replaced the bowl and salad.  When the bill came, nothing was comped.    The wait for the manager was too long.  This shows that management was extremely busy with other customer complaints.  I had kiddos with me, so I left before resolution.  I'll bring it up on my next outing"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.  The steak used to be better before they changed to the Wood Fire Grill. Never used to have to trim fat or grissel. 6 of used to be 2 for $20 and 8 is was 2 for $25. Now you get a 6oz for $25?"}
{"text":"We always get great service when we go here.  Food is always hot and cooked as requested."}
{"text":"Usually a great place to enjoy great food with great service. However, Thursday nights must not be the night to come. Service was horrendously slow with only a few employees actually working and not talking or watching tv. Although, not busy, tgats not excuse to treat what customers are there as inconviences. Our appetizer was yummy but how can you get fried mozzarella wrong.  It was the entrees that left us all regretting not going somewhere else. Food was bland (Quesadilla Burger) or overcooked (Chicken Fingers). And....burger was served without the fries. Our server said they ran out and was making more but after waiting 15 minutes, WE had to ask where they were. Server completely forgot our \"forgotten\" fries. Fries were then over seasoned and \"cold.\"  This was such a bad experience that I'm left shocked and hoping it was just a bad night and not what this location now feels is  acceptable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my cousin. The hostess Lay in our waitress Tia  (I believe that was her name) are very nice and accommodating to us. Before our food came out an emergency came in would have to leave. Tia had our food packed and ready to go within minutes. Thank you"}
{"text":"Just another Applebee's.  If your looking for average to poor service, ok food and a roof over your head.. This is the place for you. Really nothing special here."}
{"text":"Typical Applebee's. My boyfriend had a gift card to go here otherwise we definitely would've tried somewhere else. The food is just okay. We started with the white queso dip which is decent. The chips were hot which was a big plus. I had the Three Cheese Chicken Penne and it was meh. Not enough sauce and the chicken was on the grill for way too long. So dry! My boyfriend had their 9 oz sirloin and he said it was okay as well. However they gave him about a cup of sour cream with his mashed potatoes which was weird. We also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix. Bleh.  Our server was super strange too...he was very busy talking to another table and it took a lot for us to get his attention.   Place was kind of dirty. Our table was so sticky we were afraid to touch it.  Meh meh meh meh meh."}
{"text":"Waitress did a good job however the lady that sat us probably had the worst attitude I've ever seen. I understand if you've had a bad day but that's no excuse to make paying customers feel bad for choosing Applebee's for dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and myself came here on a Friday night  knowing that it would be busy we were seated in less than 10 min. We ordered and were surprised that our meal was served just as we finished our appetizer. The service was excellent  and the only thing we could find fault with was that one steak was grissly. The manager wanted to make another but I didn't think it nessary.  Our overall experience was great"}
{"text":"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. There's nothing worse than going to a restaurant starving, only to discover they don't have even ONE vegetarian option on their menu.   My dad and I made a pit stop at Applebee's on our way to the airport. We were headed on a trip and were in a bit of a time crunch. We were famished and Applebee's seemed like a safe bet. Think again. Every single item on their menu had either chicken or shrimp in it and the only thing they offered non meat-eaters was a three cheese pasta dish. Yeah, like I want to eat that and then sit on a plane for hours.   I wasn't impressed with Applebee's at all. In this day and age, it's pretty lame when a restaurant can't cater to such a prominant dietary restriction.  It was my first time there and I can guarantee you it will be my last."}
{"text":"Took my wife to the free veteran's day meal at applebees. This is the 3 rd year we visited this location. In the past, the meal portions were pretty skimpy, but the quality was good, so who can complain if it is free? Anyway this year we went and the food quality was horrible. Just horrible. I ordered \"the american standard\" burger and fries, that comes with some wierd sauce, american cheese, bacon, onions. I asked for no cheese, because I dont like smelly american cheese. I get the burger, and lift the bun, and it looks like some one took a bite out of the burger patty. I showed it to the waiter, and he agreed, and offered to get me a new one. He comes back with a supposedly new burger, which looks exactly like the one he returned. with the original bite mark, and two additional bites taken out of it. The burger had some yellow diarea looking sauce, and no bacon. I did not bother returning it, and just ate the fries. I was a cook once, and know what happens when people keep sending the food back. Wife had the chicken strip platter, and I grabbed a couple of her chicken strips. Not too good, seemed undercooked.  Needless to say, no tip for the waiter. I usually do tip, if everything is good, and service is good.  This veterans day the place was not crowded at all. Usually it is pretty crowded. Maybe a lot of people are not very impressed with the food.  I headed over to the applebees at a different location, and got a free chicke platter. Food quality no good there either.  I dont think I will be coming here for the free veterans day meals in the future. I absolutely wont be returning to pay full price for this crappy food. Just a big dis-appointment. Hey applebees, if you are reading this, the free meal thing for veterans day is an opportunity for you guys to impress people with the food, and maybe they will return as regular paying customers. But the meal portions are very skimpy and high priced, and lately the quality is horrible. example: the burger you sell is 10.99, for a couple dollars I can get a better burger at Mcdonalds.  makes me wonder how these guys remain in business."}
{"text":"August 27, 2013  5:15pm. I ordered the 7 oz sirloin medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The veggies were fine, so was the service.  The water in my glass was nasty metallic tasting. My steak was easily the worst meat I've ever been served in my life. It was an odd looking long banana-shaped thing that did not taste like beef at all. Maybe it was goat or horse but IT WAS NOT BEEF.  It sort of tasted like the jerked goat burgers I had in Jamaica. I've been eating beef my entire life, this tasted nothing like, looked nothing like, and had the consistency nothing like any beef I've ever had, in my life.  Don't think I'll be going back there. Ever.  I did not want to complain at the store because there is no coming back from being served a piece of meat like this, it should have never been served to a human customer. Complaining only jeopardizes your safety in any restaurant. Never send food back to the kitchen for replacement is my philosophy. We simply cut short our visit and got the hell out without saying a word. I'll express my displeasure by never returning."}
{"text":"Walked in and no one greeting us, there was a bartender behind the bar, and a waitress folding napkins next to the bar who clearly made eye contact with me so we sat ourselves, after 5 minutes of sitting with no attention not even a hello.  the girl folding napkins finally walked over and told us they were not seating in this area and we can seat in the bar area. Then she said \"sorry I didn't see you guys walk in\" even though we made eye contact.   Pretty sad if you ask me.   My steak came out medium and very pink, when I ordered medium well. Because I cannot eat pink/raw meat. Then the bill had been charged for the extra steak, good thing I had caught, I was not going to pay for an extra steak they messed up on.   Overall, I will never eat here again, service and food was awful."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our visit here yesterday afternoon. My husband's order was never put in. No one came to check if all our meals were given to us or if we needed refills. When we finally were able to get someone's attention, we were told that his order was never put in, and if he wanted to wait it would be an additional 15 min. By this time our group was almost done eating. My husband said forget it. We were only offered a dessert by the manager. I would have hoped she would of at least offered us a free meal when we came back (which we never will) or a discount off our tab. No tip for you."}
{"text":"I just found out about Yelp so I want to let the consumers know about Applebee on Spring Mt and Rainbow me and my son went there on Feb 2 2016. I order the quesadilla burger he had a regular burger we both had ice tea as drinks. First they don't let you know that  the game that you're playing at the table they're charging you for. So you don't know that until you look at your tickets that you got charged for a game that would just sitting at the table. Second $35 for two hamburgers and two drinks. Third it made me sick as a dog me and my son was sick for two days after eating their. Don't waste your money. I will not be going back their."}
{"text":"Really crappy food, too loud music and poor service. How does this chain stay in business. I won't be coming back b"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. Everything was perfect, ordered online and car sided. Had pasta and steak!"}
{"text":"I'm sure we've all been to an Applebee's somewhere across the country.  Yes it's a chain but I still enjoy a meal here.    The hubs and I split the Brew Pub Pretzels and cheese to start.  Great garlic flavor with not too much salt.  The cheese was creamy and covered the pretzels delightfully!   We also split the Clubhouse Grill Sandwich.  It's filled with ham, turkey, cheese, bacon and the rest of the fixins.  It was good! Maybe the toasted bread was a bit over-buttered so my hands were all shiny after eating it.  Oh well.  Id probably get it again if I were splitting it with someone.  Otherwise it is a bit much for me to eat.    Service- the waitress was great.  She was also tending the bar but she did her best at keeping our drinks filled.  We were just baffled by the time it took for the food to come out.  Did we order three steaks well done? No.   So my three stars is how I feel.  Just a -ok."}
{"text":"Horrible small portions greasy not to specifications feel bad for the waitresses that they have a horrible cook won't be back"}
{"text":"Applebee's is a great restaurant to eat at. The food, drinks, and prices Are great. But not at this location. The service sucks. And if you ask for a booth table they get pissy with you. It takes forever for them to bring the drinks. I don't like this location. I drive further down the road just for the better service."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar on a Sunday after work. Got the French onion soup (very good) and the brisket nachos. The nachos were listed as having queso cheese on them, but when I got my order all I had was a weak smattering of melted shredded cheese. As I was picking at them, I asked the bartender if I could get a side of the queso since they forgot it. After checking in the kitchen, she said they were out of the queso, but the manager would come by and probably give me a discount. The manager DID come over, but just gave a weak apology and reiterated there was no queso. No discount. He did ask if I wanted something else, but by that time I just wanted to leave. If you're out of something, let the customer know before you make it so they can order something else. The manager just didn't seem to care about anything. I won't rush back."}
{"text":"Applebee's has really stepped it up!  Lately when we go for lunch the staff has been amazing. Everyone is very friendly and the service is great.  I love how they are always adding new menu items.  This is definitely my favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Got in at 830 tonight, because Chili's was a complete nightmare. The hostess gladly sat our starving party.  Sitting, waiting. No one acknowledged us.   Finally, the bartender came and took our drink AND food order. 3 waters, a sprite, and a margarita.  He was a dick.  Cocky as hell.  Didnt have a note pad... didnt write down our order.... he did it all from memory... uh, dude... if youre going to do that... make sure you get the order actually RIGHT.  We ordered my daughter a grilled cheese, which thankfully came out quickly.  22, ---- yes twenty two---- minutes after being seated, we got our water.   45 minutes after being seated, i got my Margarita. Yep. Our food came before my beverage.... and the bar was 5 feet away from us.   The food was decent. But the service just sucked.   I ordered a cowboy burger.....  i was brought out a fajita burger.   We ordered wings with buffalo sauce on the side. Wings come, no sauce. Had to ask 2 different people for buffalo sauce.   If the staff wasn't so shitty, thisnplace would be great."}
{"text":"literally the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Hideous food, awful service. The food was burned and tasteless. Can't believe our waitress gave us the bill in the middle of our meal. Definitely won't come here again."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Applebees in a very long time and all I can give, is 2 stars. The waitress was awesome! She was very attentive and super sweet. We did the 2 for $25. I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp. It says Cajun seasoned but I couldn't  taste anything because it was BEYOND salty, and that's saying something for me because I do love my salt. But there wasn't enough water in the world to quench my thirst, I left parched! It was like it had all been soaked in salt, then seasoned with salt and cooked. It just was permeated with salt. No \"Cajun\" flavor whatsoever. The potatoes that came as the side were frozen potatoes. The only good thing we ate was the artichoke spinach dip appetizer.  Definitely not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a NO STAR review for this location.  When we walked in I told my party to 'Let's leave because there were a total of 2 patrons,' but they insisted that we stay.  So we did and thus began the nightmare of hellish food.  The only bright spot was the waitress.  Service was good and we had some idiots in our party.  Plus it was seven of us.  She did good.  To the food.  I ordered from their 'new' menu the steak & quinoa.  The steak was old and dry and instead of pink in the middle for medium rare it was gray.  And it had a smell to it.  The runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot.  It smelled & looked like food that was out of a bag & dumped into the plate for the microwave.  My granddaughters chicken tenders were as hard as rocks and her fries were cold.  My daughter's ribs were slathered in sauce but underneath were hard and old.  The broccoli was underdone and was that pale green they are underneath before cooking. The salad was drowned in Ranch dressing and the iceberg lettuce was old as shoe leather in a thrift shop.  The drinks seemed ok as my daughter ordered four shots.  But I don't even recommend going to the bar.  The bartender stood there and picked her nose.  Then flicked.  Again, the bartender picked her nosed and. Then. Flicked."}
{"text":"Late posting this was actually here Saturday around 7 pm.  So the waitress was nice but we had to ask for steak knives, the shrimp was dry over cooked and we had to keep asking for refills on ice tea- you'd think they would just see the glass was almost empty and bring the pitcher and ask if we needed a refill.  All in all it was ok but I'll choose another place for an early date night."}
{"text":"Well my good friend took me to one of our favorite dining places which is the Applebee's on 3340 S. Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas. We always have a great time there. We do our usual geeky banter talking about LOTRO and this particular time we laughed about a petting dog video on YouTube \"I pet my dog\" (Hysterical) Our waitress ISABEL O was perky and delightful. The food was divine and the dessert delish...as always Applebee's rocks!!! We have been going to them for around 18 years."}
{"text":"To Isabel.. I was happy with your service on June 8th around 12pm..I guess others in my party were not...I love coming here.my daughter and I sneak here whenever we can.this time we were celebrating her graduation...and as always it was a great time.. Even if we had to stay at the other end of the table, to be away from the party we came with..ijs....really booshie....lol....thank you .."}
{"text":"We went there on Fathers Day, what a big mistake. We got dirty dishes and one of the worst service ever. Our waitress named Diana G was a smart Ass and need to learn how to give customer service. We will never go there again and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemies. Save your time and money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered the restaurant all were dumbfounded on how they were going to accommodate us. It was 2 adults and 5 children. Myself and my kids were visiting from San Diego looking for our final meal before hitting the road. Food came out separately instead of serving us all at once we ate in tandem. My kids food was not right. So much confusion on making the Margarita right, seating us in the restaurant versus the bar....umm no we have children with us we want to sit in the restaurant. This for me was a horrible experience. I will not be returning to any Applebee's anywhere."}
{"text":"I cannot even give this location a single star, 1st it took FOREVER to be seated. But the app won't let me post this without a single start. Its not like they were busy...you can count how many ppl were in the place...the food is over priced for the amount of food you get. My wife order a well done steak & they were unable to do this simple task. We needed ketchup for my kids fried & i had to take the bottle from another table. The blue moon deal $2 for a small 6oz cup is a ripoff. The ONLY positive thing out of all this was our waitress, which was very sweet & apologetic for this horrendous experience."}
{"text":"Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee's & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don't know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool!"}
{"text":"Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok, the service can ruin the meal and experience!   That being said my coworker and I stopped into Applebee's for the Pick n' Pair lunch special. The hostess sat us at our table with no greeting and lucky for us she was our waitress as well...sarcasm intended and required.   She took our drink order walked away several minutes later she returned with our drinks...asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we placed our ordered. I chose the Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup.   Now, I don't know how long it takes to put soup in the bowl and throw some salad on a plate but with maybe two other tables occupied and it being late in the afternoon it certainly doesn't take half my lunch hour. And for those of us who try to leave the office for some peace of mind and freedom during the workday...when you are on your lunch hour every moment counts.  When our food finally arrived with the few moments we had left on a lunch break. I scarfed it down I think it tasted ok. From what I remember, the salad was spicy and the jalapeno dressing was yummy! The chicken tortilla soup was just ok. It could have used a few more pieces of chicken and spice to take it up a notch.   Overall, the experience was horrible. The service was horrible. The food was ok. I won't be running back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"All I  can say is WOW!!!!!! I really have no words to best describe this place, The best Applebee's so far, customer service is 5 stars I have been on $$$$ Restaurants in NYC and have not received this type of service......... If you ever come here and see this dude with a MR. Jackson name tag this guys is the freaking best!!!!! Recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome bartender Sam! :) Great happy hour from 9pm-close! And they have great faucets in their bathroom!"}
{"text":"I showed up early afternoon, so the place wasn't very full and therefore got pretty good service.  Tried the Triple Hog Dare Ya and it was a very interesting sandwich.  It was pretty tasty.  My drink was kept full and the food arrived quickly.  The little computer on the table was fun to play with, but I can see where it would not be very useful with a larger crowd of people.  It was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Their new menu is good but wow no sense of urgency with the staff. It's a Sunday there's a bunch of open seats and we waited 15 mins to get any ones attention. Now it's been 15 mins were just waiting for our drinks. Luckily we ordered our food with the drinks but come on. Even if you're a little short show that you are trying to be quick or get people who will be."}
{"text":"Busy place every time I show up. Great happy hour two times a day! At 3-6pm amd 9-close."}
{"text":"There are no words I can find to explain what happened here last night. A family of African American descent came in and one of them had been drinking. He came to our table and was chatting and sat down, he was not unpleasant, he was speaking about racism and how he was over it and didn't blame white people... then they asked him to move to his table and the manager came over and kicked all of them out and said it was because he was drunk. They said they just wanted to eat. Your manager was very unprofessional in her choice of words and actions. It was so upsetting to me. They were not being loud or rude at all. It was horrifying. I will not support establishments like this. Sorry Applebee's.... boycotting now."}
{"text":"I came in on Saturday expecting it to be busy and it was a little bit, not as bad as I expected. The Food was good and the waitress was nice, but they get 3 stars due to all of the little problems there were, that if only 1 or 2 had happened I wouldn't of cared.   I'm going to give only the biggest of the problems, the 1st being that when they put down our food, they took away my daughters drink, which was half full, it took 10 min before I saw someone again to get it. When I received my Cowboy burger, which I got vegetarian with no bacon, there was no BBQ sauce on it, like there was supposed to be, and I don't mean there was just a drop on the bun, there's was none. I had to ask twice for the sauce, and I got it with my daughters water, and since I don't like to eat a burger dry, I usually have mayo, or BBQ, of Ketchup on it, my Burger was cold when I finally ate it. When the waitress dropped, and I mean dropped, the water and the BBQ on the the table, she was in such a hurry that even though the cup had a lid, it still spilled on the table, Luckily it didn't hit the food.  Now the reasons we kept having problems was the waitress, even though she was friendly, she was to busy handing out business cards for her makeup business and trying to get clients that we kept having issues."}
{"text":"Seriously, people?  It's Applebee's, this is Yelp, why is this on here?  I've actually been to this one, and while it isn't worse than other locations, it's meh like all the rest.  Generic food selections, crap decor, plus this one is right by a poorly-planned mall and traffic is terrible.  This was only a good idea when I worked at the grocery store next door and could walk over and get my a** drunk after work here.  Please, consider your non-chain options, or a better chain than this.  This does NOT deserve an average of 4 stars, which puts it on par with places that are actually good as the result of critical reviews."}
{"text":"Our favorite Applebees closed, so my wife and I ventured to this particular Applebees.  We tried the 2 for 25 menu and ordered a half rack of baby back ribs. For our appetizer we had the artichoke dip. The food was not bad. Our ribs were a bit dry for my liking. The artichoke dips was great, However the chips served with our dip were stale....overall I would eat there again if I got decent chips for the dip. The service was o.k. We had to ask our server for refills.....I always say try yourself and come to your own conclusions....."}
{"text":"They have definitely upped their game here!  the food is WAY better and just all around quality and taste of the options are much better then the bland bar type food i remember from years ago!  Will start to frequent here more often"}
{"text":"I've honestly never had a good experience here. The waiters always seem to hate their jobs and the hostesses just stand there and watch TV. I just left there and got the unlimited soup and salad and our waitress only checked on us once after the food came out. We had to ask the hostess to go find her when we wanted a refills. She passed us multiple times without even looking at us and then we had to wait for her to remember about us for us to get the check. I wanted desert but I wasn't willing to wait more for it. Third bad experience. Won't give them another chance."}
{"text":"Great location! I've been coming to this location since it was built. Two nights in a row now!! Applebee's, Sweet n' Spicy Ribs, Onion Rings, n' Chili Nachos. Yessss :)"}
{"text":"Asked for the gluten-free menu and was told that I the hostesses had them so had to get up and run around to track one down--it was never found and management finally printed out a new menu about 20 minutes later.  A terrible smell kept coming back, even despite the efforts of the hostesses and their over-spraying of air freshener throughout the entire space.  The air freshener was not a good mix with my food either.    The plus, great bartender who kept the drinks coming and made sure to keep tabs on the slow food order."}
{"text":"Seriously? I'm the first to review? Anyway... I'm killing time waiting to pick a friend up from the airport and her flight is delayed so I've found myself at this Applebee's sipping on a Long Island which is apparently on special tonight for $3.99 and munching on some brew pub pretzels and cheese. Burnt cheese, to be exact. See the picture. The Long Island is tasty and not too strong and the bartenders service has been good. They just need to check the cheese before it burns. Cooking 101."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend & I decided to get lunch & it was either between IHOP & Applebee's & we went with Applebee's, I was so excited to try some new dishes out & got salads before our meal came. My boyfriend was mid done with his salad & I was just starting it when I noticed A BUG IN MY SALAD. It looked exactly like it was part of my dish & thank god I'm a observant eater & I told him to stop eating & for us to cancel our order & we left. So disappointed & disgusted. Should have went to IHOP."}
{"text":"I am not normally an Applebee's person, but I have to say we say at a bar table and the bartender was our waiter and he was fabulous.  The food was so so but the service was fabulous !"}
{"text":"Our food was good, fallon was wonderful but the management sux at this location. Stop demeaning servers in front of guests it makes you look very bad. As a restaurant manager for 25 years I've never seen this kind of behavior from a management staff."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular Applebee's customer at another location. The chain as a whole recently changed their Happy Hour menu and now the dishes that I used to get are not included. My boyfriend and I went out for appetizers and drinks and to sit an watch a football game and our bill was huge. I will not be going back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst place to go! Placed a $60 order, curbside to go. Expected longer time because large order (3 entrees, 2 appetizers). Got there in about 20 minutes. Sat 10 min, some one stuck head out said be right there. Another 10 minutes, manager came out, asked my name, told him, he took my credit card. Order was placed online and paid for?? No idea why he wanted card??, I complied. Sat another 7 minutes he came out and confirmed name, order, color of my car. About 13 minutes later he came out apologized again for the delay. FINALLY got my order after about 55 minutes. Got home and EVERYTHING WAS NASTY. Salad had brown lettuce, Riblets were so burned under sauce I was eating chunky charcoal. Paid $6.99 for 4 pieces of pretzel not over 1/2 inch long covered in cinnamon but NO caramel. Got no honey dijon sauce with the Beer cheese pretzels. The steak was so tough could not be eaten, and the chicken was like rubber.  WE THREW EVERYTHING OUT AND HAD SANDWICHES.  THIS WAS ONE OF WORST MEALS WE'VE EVER PAID FOR. FOR SURE IN TOP THREE WHAT A WASTE OF  MONEY. AND TO THINK WE TIPPED THESE INCOMPETENTS!!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!! I RECOMMEND YOU AVOID LIKE PLAGUE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, door hostess, and waitress who made great suggestions. New entree Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken (photo) just the right portion size and room for a sweet dessert also new- Brownie Bite!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible! Got back on our bike and drove to Applebee's at Southern and Power. Got here and got and drink and our food ordered I believe before we would have even been acknowledged at the one on this review. Skipping it altogether would be my recommendation!"}
{"text":"They were a little short staff today but the girl working the bar & take out was great. She was patient and polite and my food is great."}
{"text":"Usually great service. Not going to lie usually they mess up my order but are willing to fix it with no attitude that's The only reason I go back. Food is good, and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the service was great! That's why they are getting any stars at all.   Usually we have a good experience at other Applebees, but I won't be back to this location. None of the food looked very fresh and it was pretty greasy. I had lemon chicken on rice and it taste like the chicken was old and the rice was a solid clump like it had been sitting in a pot and stuck in microwave.   Sadly, the worst part was the condition of the restaurant. The tables are cracked and falling apart, the floors were so dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. My shoes stuck to the bathroom floor and the toilets were all full and had not been cleaned.  Do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good. Found out some of our favorites are going away. I'm sad.  Hope the new items will be just as good or better. The bad thing about dinner last night is a customer was on a conference call 2 tables away. It was so loud we couldn't talk at our table. The waitresses were talking about how rude and loud this lady was. She had the conference calls. 3 of them   On speaker. Not one staff member or manager said something so the rest of us could enjoy our meal. We won't be going back since no one has any back bone."}
{"text":"Overall, pretty \"meh\" experience. It's what you would expect from an Applebee's. I probably won't come back unless otherwise coerced by non-discerning co-workers or friends."}
{"text":"I could have avoided posting negative review only if Applebee's was courteous/professional enough to reply back to my feedback email on my dine-in experience: We requested server to get us water with lime and server returned back with all the glasses of water without lime. After that all the plates served were dirty and wet. I politely requested the server to replace the plates but surprisingly the plates she brought were again all wet. I then requested the manager to change server for our table and get us new plates. The new server brought us 2 plates even though we were 3 adults, and again both the plates were wet. I should mention the food was delicious and the manager and both servers were courteous. Its just that I have had better experience at Applebee's in other locations and having hygienic dine-in experience is the least I would expect."}
{"text":"Amazing service at this location. The waitress/bartender Salem is very attentive and friendly. Great recommendations from her. The other staff was wonderful as well. Manager Greg came out and helped and was very attentive and complete when bringing out the food. The food was incredible, my shrimp were cooked perfect and the steak plate was grilled to perfection. A must visit location if you are in the mood for Applebees cuisine."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Dont come here if you are in any hurry.  There is something seriously wrong with the staff when they won't acknowledge you exist.  I feel sorry for the residents of Goodyear who put up with this crap.  Will definitely NOT be coming back to this location or any applebees."}
{"text":"Food was great Service was excellent! Its nice to have a server who actually treated us good. I think her name was Hanana.Blonde girl with braids...Well good job...I'm definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to this Applebee's because it was close to home. They are not very organized and it seems as if there is no one in charge cause everyone is just doing what they want. We were sat down pretty quick but were not given silver ware which I thought is the very first thing you get. We ordered a couple apps and had someone brings us silver ware, sure enough our apps come out and behold a hair was in the food. They brought us a new fresh plate and took the first order of the bill but still charged us for the second order. To the heat of my knowledge common curtesy is to wave that off the bill. Anyways, will not be coming back at all."}
{"text":"My dad ordered curbside and we got the worst food on planet earth. This is the second time our portions were 1/4 what they should be.... had to wait on hold forever to talk to a manager. The whole operation is awful and I hope this location goes out of business. They surely won't have mine again. When we asked to credit our garbagehole meal, we were offered an insulting $25 gift card... NEWSFLASH, we will not come here again!!! Horrible service, horrible food, horrible everything  $25 credit for two awful experiences in a row! Manager should be fired.... most establishments would credit but maybe he knows this is the final curtain for Applebee's.  BYE!"}
{"text":"Quick summary: Not bad, not great... But I'll be back to try it again.  Positives: 1) Friendly service. 2) Good brownie. 3) Enjoyed the fajita roll up. 4) Nice decor/ambiance 5) Lounge has many tvs, if you're there for a game. 6) Menu has a  2 can dine for $25/$30 page that seems like a good deal (we didn't try it though).   Negatives: 1) Feels pricey for, what seems like a kitchen that would come to a standstill without their microwave (aka most items look pre-made, ready to be nuked and plated but you still pay $$$) 2) cold mushrooms. 3) Dense, cold-ish fries. 4) Service was very pleasant, but not terribly attentive. Not sure that was her fault, they might be understaffed. 5) Redundant menu items? Not really a negative but still odd, for what's a rather large menu?  Summary: It's a combo of Boston Pizza and Montana's. Quality is lacking for the price point (felt like it averaged $16 for most entrees), but (sadly) on par for the northeast. Having said that, for a place to just chill with friends, it'll do. I'm also willing to be patient with a place that's still new."}
{"text":"the drink was weak, possibly forgot to add alcohol.  Shrimp was cold, not cooked to order.  did not offer the military discount until we pointed out that Applebee's advertised one.  I sent shrimp back and the problem was corrected but did not receive my dish until my date was half way through his meal.  I'll skip their drinks from now on.  Josh, our waiter, was accommodating,  restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot with my son but when I switched my diet to lower fat dishes I was disappointed at the menu choices available at Applebee's. They sound good on paper, look good, and taste okay but the portions are so minuscule it's easy to see why they're so low-cal. Good in a pinch but watch the salsa. One time we got a bad batch and the tomatoes or something had turned - blech! Anyway, now that we're more into supporting local establishments, eating at chains is no longer part of the plan."}
{"text":"Came here because I was super Hangry and it was close to my house. The service here is good, but the food could have been better.  I ordered the 2 for 20 special dinner for 2 and for appetizer I got the bbq boneless wings and spinach artichoke dip. The wings was a grand slam because the bbq sauce was just right sweet and tangy. The artichoke dip on the other was too greasy and we barely can taste the Parmesan in there. My girl got the 6 oz sirloin steak and it was cooked perfectly. Her potatoes were cooked good but mine were refried and almost burnt. I got the bourbon chicken with shrimp and it was delicious because of that grilled taste.   If my potatoes were more edible this place would be a 4, and yes I know this franchise is a well known factor for many Americans but the quality put into cooking the food may need some improving."}
{"text":"Terrible service today. Only 4 tables filled and it took for ever to get our food. I ordered a side salad that they didn't bring out till the main dish was served. It also took 15 minutes to get our bill after asking for it. I have no problem tipping 25% but not today. No tip left today. Definitely in need of some new staff."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at! It's very conveniently located around my neighborhood. The food here is perfect. I'm usually the type of person that will order the same thing at every place that I visit. Since coming here I've had the triple bacon burger, honey pepper tenders with Mac and cheese, and most recently the shrimp and sirloin. Shrimp and sirloin is something I would recommend to everyone! Shrimps are drenched with this garlic parmesan and it's amazing! Jesus is a great waiter there"}
{"text":"I should have known with the one star rating to not go here. I have a woodfired steaks if they advert on TV. Big mistake on my part. I order the 8 ounce sirloin expecting a half way decent piece of meat Did not happen. Also my waitress named Sheila could not care less that I was not happy. The meal was 30 dollars and I felt like it was a waste of money"}
{"text":"Daughter and I went out for steaks - had a gift card to use.  Haven't been  there in a long time, but did not taste like we remembered OR we just compared it to Longhorn-which Applebees is not comparible.  Alot of gristle and fat - really thin cuts and overcooked and underseasoned too.  Might go back for other menu items but don't recommend the steaks, esp for the prices.  Waitress was pretty good and was clean inside."}
{"text":"Food has gone down and menu too. Ordered French dip sandwich and no horseradish sauce, dry. No dressing on Asian chicken salad, no barbecue sauce for sandwich ordered, garlic bread was plain breadsticks. Service is lacking and so is food. Doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"How the h*** does it take 45 mins for a salad to come out. Food takes so effin long to come and our server keeps saying that \"it will be out shortly\" or \"i will put your order in\" B.S! In between our meal of (ALL YOU CAN EAT) we asked the server to bring us another set and he said that \"I will put it in the system\" finally our food is done and server came back asked if we wanted a togo box...WTF OUR 2nds has not come back yet so we asked him about it and he said he FORGOT to put it again in the system so THAT MEANS we had to wait for another 30 effin mins for our soup and salad to come out... WTF... FML.... kitchen made me a cold food that also comes with the 2 pieces of fries (over exaggerate). Remember this day 10/26/17 and time between 2pm-5pm NEVER COME TO EAT AT THIS PLACE AT THIS TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Poor management and not at all customer friendly. Waited 20 minutes last night while seven empty tables stacked with dirty plates not cleared to make room for new customers. Left hungry and disgusted. We went across street to Native New Yorker where we were immediately greeted and given a table and drinks served quickly. The food and atmosphere was exceptional!  This Applebee's location lost my business and my respect. If I could rate zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Always fun here. Love happy hour!!  The bar staff rocks!!! Good happy hour prices and munchies."}
{"text":"took my daughter their for her sweet 16, she ordered the appitizers and I got a margarita. I let her just have one sip for her bday party and the stafff threw a tantrum. lighten up applebees, when i was 16 applesbees didnt care about that kind of stuff. no longer the kind of place to bring a well adjusted family. NO THANKS!!!!!!!!!! Pretty good prices though."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The steaks here are always juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty much what you'd expect from Applebee's, can get pretty lod on certain  nights.  Michelle, Celeste, and Jen  are awesome  can't say enough  good things about them.  Manager  izzy is a real douchedbag though and  not very smart. However manager Patrick is awesome!   Check it out for your own opinion."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere, but at the bar Rihanna needs to work on her verbal and nonverbal verbal communication skills while addressing customers."}
{"text":"They keep his place like an icebox! Music is way too loud, you can't even have a conversation at your table."}
{"text":"Wretched service and disgusting food.  Not sure why people line up for Applebees but this one was especially bad.  All I ordered was a couple of appetizers (previously learned never to order food from these places) and it took over 45 minutes.  Then the appetizers came out wrong and were no good.  I've eaten better finger foods at AM/PM.  I understand people like the 1/2 off happy hour specials but I dont.  The beer selection sucks and so do the apps.  I just need to find out who I'm going to give the last gift card I got to this place.  Note to everyone:  If you hate your friend/relative give them a gift card to Applebees."}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at an Applebee's for 7+ years.  Saw recent TV ads - thought we'd give it another try.  Food looked & smelled tasty.  But, same thing occurred as some years ago.  We all agreed that Applebees needs to change their name to \"Wannabe's\".  Restaurant chain is not a steakhouse, seafood restaurant, nor specializes in BBQ.  All if the meats are previously frozen which is evident by their tastes  and textures.  We confirmed this with our server.   Even \"flash freezing\"  causes molecular changes in all meats.  Server could not confirm if if meats were flash frozen or delivered as regular frozen. Steak was chewy, ribs were not smoked and chewy (I.e., did not fall off of the bone), and the shrimp, OMG! It was chewy & tasteless except for outside grilling flavor. The only good thing we can say about our visit was the staff  who care friendly and attentive to over compensate for the food.  Applebee's wants to be a steakhouse, seafood restaurant, and a BBQ shack, thus, our new nickname, \"Wannabe's\".   It's a restaurant for those who want something a bit nicer than Village Inn, but, do not have refined taste for fresh meats.  For a few dollars more, one can eat at a true steakhouse, freash seafood and real BBQ restaurants that serve fresh, non-frozen meats."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch because it was close to our shopping and really did not expect much from a chain restaurant but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I feel funny writing a great review for a chain restaurant but it was very good and the waitress, Heather, was great and we were seated quickly even though it was right at lunch on a Wednesday.  Manager came by and asked how everything was and was interested in what we said.  I had the 'Unlimited soup and salad\" and the first soup was their tomato basil which was great and I had the Santa Fe chicken salad with it, also very good.  Then I opted for the potato bacon soup which was very very good and the spinach shrimp salad with bacon dressing that was excellent also and for $7, that was amazing compared to Olive Garden, for example.  My wife had one of the new sandwiches which was a roast beef bacon mushroom melt and I had a bite and it was top of the line as well.  Service and food were both great, yeah, I know it is a chain restaurant and the 'foodies' will probably turn their nose up with this review but what the heck, I liked it a lot and we will be back."}
{"text":"The service here sucks and the AYCE Fish was way over priced for the amt of fish that WE GOT and was mostly batter and grease.  Had stomach issues within the hour of consuming it. Our guests ordered salads and soups which did not come until we sent the entrees back to the kitchen . Servers gave us a pissed off look when we did. Meals came back looking under the heat lamp sad and limp. Meal was overall GROSS ! Too many other good restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chicken with beer cheese topping was gre at.  Stay away from the all you can eat riblets.  They are tough and not good. Overpriced because the refill is a joke."}
{"text":"It's hard to find to find a nice sit down restaurant near the base. This is by far my favorite place to go in Nellis. The wait staff at this location are phenomenal! Kudos to you guys!  We waited only about 5 minutes on a Saturday night to be seated at a table. This location does have the table kiosk where you can order appetizers, desserts, and play games.   Our waitress was very friendly, timely, and patient with us as we were trying to find what vegan options they offer. The service was fast and food was great. Everything tastes fresh and hot! My wife loved her salmon and said it was cooked perfectly. The portion size of the fish was large, where as there was only a scant amount of veggies on the plate.   Our drinks were always full and out waitress checked in on us at the perfect moments. My friends ordered the banana Cracker Jack cheesecake and they devoured it ! I will keep coming back to this location when I feel like a sit down meal or munchies and drinks !!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and today was the worst visit ever. I ordered the parm steak and shrimp. I ordered my steak medium it came well done sent it back this time it came back rare sent it back. By the time I had gotten the second steak my husband had just about finished his entree. I told them never mind I don't want it. They offered to make something or have soup. No thanks why bother the point is to eat a meal as a family not wait for insincere apology and tell me the meat thermometer is probably not working.  I think there's been a change in management because our visits have consistently gotten worse. Last two visits my cocktails had bugs in them so I won't order from the bar anymore. I guess I won't order from the kitchen anymore either after 8 years this is our last visit."}
{"text":"I'm only in PHX 2 years, this Applebee's is just 10 minutes down from the Biltmore where I live. It is always crowded, a bit noisy, if a wait, not too long for a table. The manager, Neill, constantly checks tables to see if everything is ok with the diners. Had 1 issue with the kitchen preparation of the food on a prior visit, Neill had it corrected at once. Wait staff is very attentive even when they have a lot of tables. We had a waiter the other night, Max, who is the best of them all, so is Jeremy. The burgers are great, they have a Monday burger special with fries for $5.99, after 9 pm wings 45 cents each, always cooked to perfection. I have had lunches and dinners here, sandwiches, chicken and beef dishes, all nice portions and very tasty. I did notice with concern a full bar many nights and only 1 bartender. He was keeping up with the rush but they should have 2 on busy nights.  I am here at least 2 days a week sometimes more, so that says it."}
{"text":"Went there for Thanksgiving it was my third time there. It was clean and the staff was very friendly. I tend to go in the afternoon or early evening on weekends each time I have been there and it hasn't been crowded. Thanksgiving dinner was really tasty."}
{"text":"This is mine and my fianc√©'s favorite Applebee's location in Vegas. We eat out a lot and this is one of our go to places. Everything is really fairly priced and tastes good. We love to get the two for $25 which includes an entr√©e & 2 dinners. Are usually get the steak (which is surprisingly good!) and garlic mashed with broccoli. The hubby usually gets three cheese mac & cheese with honey chicken tenders & I always have to sneak some of that too lol. Car-side to go is a great option when you don't feel like fast food but you don't want to sit down in a restaurant either that's usually what we decide to do.  I love that they have this option & they make it easy so you can order online or on the phone ! some of the girls are a little slow in coming out to the car when they first see you but other than that it is a great experience for a nice family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? We were on vacation, and stayed in Las Vegas for 3 nights. On our first night we were very tired and just wanted to grab some food and relax in our hotel room. I called Applebee's Car-to-Go and ordered cedar grilled chicken with quinoa for myself and chicken tenders with sweet potato fries and ranch dip for my daughter.   When I got to our room and opened the take-out bag I found that instead of grilled chicken and quinoa I had salmon and potatoes (a difference of +$3.30), and my daughter had chicken tenders with regular (white potato) fries and NO dip.   Food was OK but disappointment level was at a plus 10. They totally screwed up the entire order!!   Will I try them again? Absolutely not. Will I tell all of my friends. You bet!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was Lisa, she was pretty rude and unprofessional, was pretty clueless to the menu, usually gets treated good at this Apple bees but this ruined my expierence, she was wiping down tables with this over server and all they were talking down Apple bees and just talking about when they can finally go home, if you don't want to work here th"}
{"text":"I gave five stars because : we got seated quickly; nice cosy atmosphere; order was taken quickly by pleasant waiter who was also bartender;food arrived quickly AND most importantly - it was super fresh, tasty,nicely presented, and with tip we were out of there for less than $45.00!!  My husband and I had steak from the 2 for $25.00 menu. If you r looking for FRESH and low carbohydrate food that is REAL you will not be disappointed here! Very few places are like that any more!  This Applebee's is one of the best!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Applebee's in the valley. I've gone twice and asked for the wings, grilled with light sauce. They make them completely wrong. After sending them back three times, which is awful because who likes to waste food, the manager just told me that he took it upon himself to make them without sauce, whether I liked it or not. So much for customer service.The bartender is a really good guy and hard-working, and the only reason I even gave it a second try. I will stick to any other Applebee's besides this one, they have no idea what they are doing"}
{"text":"The staff were all friendly and quite cheerful. Kept our drinks full and the endless ribs coming. Presented me with 3 different sauces to try and were always available when needed. The floor manager was even there asking how our experience was and if the food was to our liking and temperature. Wish Jesse a lot of luck with what ever she plans on doing for her life but being a waitress is right up her alley. She did everything exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Visiting from Wisconsin and we had a gift card for Applebee's. Haven't been there in almost 2 years because service is always bad and food sucks. Was hoping maybe in a different state it'd be better...it was not. Got the three cheese chicken penne, it was okay tasting, chicken was rubbery and it was a small portion. Didn't finish it. My significant other got the double crunch wings, which were surprisingly decent and actually a decent size instead of insanely small like normal. Which was one positive. We sat in the bar, and were greeted by a female bartender, she looked at my newly 21 year old girlfriends ID and said they don't accept vertical IDs...why she's 21 and we were just trying to have a couple drinks with our food; we had gone to Flemings and Red Robin already since we had been here with no problems, why is Applebee's such high security?!? She then proceeded to say that it was okay for now but my girlfriend had 30 days after her birthday to get a new one that was horizontal or they wouldn't accept it again. Okay fine, we will just spend our money someplace else than. Never going back, it was very awkward after all that. Really hoping nobody tries to give us a gift card for here again because I'll just have to throw it out. Not worth the time or money. Just go to sports bar in the area, they have better service food and drink specials and don't have awkward/rude comments about what way your ID is facing."}
{"text":"This place I have a love/hate relationship with, they have a lot of really good food and dishes like all the appetizers and burgers. But they often serve cold food and the service is subpar. But man between the prices and decent amount of really good dishes it keeps me coming back from time to time."}
{"text":"Nicole and CJ are the bees knees. I have a food allergy, and they've never made me feel weird about making obscure special requests because of it. I recommend this Applebee's for these two ladies. Pretty sure they work later, so catch them for happy hour at the Applebee's bar. Totes."}
{"text":"Here right now & I'm so irritated I'm about to just leave without paying. First off, walk in... Wait about 10 minutes to be seated. I assume the manager came to seat us, he seats us & the silverware is all jacked up. The napkin looked used & all ripped up & the guy clearly noticed it, apologized & was gonna bring us a new set. Soo we're waiting.. Waitress comes... I order Oreo cookie milkshake. She comes back & gives me this long story about how they ran out, etc... 10 minutes later comes back & apologized.. Apparently the barista played a joke on her & they actually weren't out of ice cream. Whatever ok, annoying. Meanwhile, still no utensils. So I asked waitress for utensils, she sarcastically replies \"okay I'll get them even though  your foods not here, cause I'm sure you'll need them beforehand\". Really irritated now. Get my food... Fries tasted like they'd been sitting, tasted old & not even remotely fresh or warm. To top it off, waited 15min for the bill. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Worst Applebee's every. Took 10 min for someone to get my water. Placed my order and when they brought my oriental chicken salad the chicken was hard and dried out, a drizzle of dressing. My soup bowl was completely cracked, so then I couldn't eat anymore, lost my appetite. Guy asked me once how I was doing, and didn't even give me a chance to talk. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Well they food is good but it takes forever and forever. Also you see them just standing around not sure what they are doing in the kitchen"}
{"text":"No greeter :(  waited atleast two minutes for someone to finally walk up.. It want even busy! Oh but I go for the shooters especially the chocolate mousse .. The bahama mama too during happy hour! Great desert , great server , although bad service as soon as i walked in"}
{"text":"Food was cooked well and the service was fast and good.  It was not very busy for a Thursday night so we were able to get in and out while still enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. From the general manager to our waiter. Our food was cold. It was not busy at all. The worst of it all is that it stinks when you walk in to the waiting area before you reach the hostess station to be seated. I will not go back. So sad we only have a few restaurants of this type in Laveen and this one sucks!"}
{"text":"We were the first people of the day to come in for lunch. It was a Sunday so they had all the TV's set for all the football games. The person who sat us was very nice and talkative. Our waitress was prompt at our table to welcome us and ask us for our drink order.  We ordered an appetizer the Artichoke dip and chips and two Chinese Chicken Salads. Our waitress says great those are on the 2 for $20 deal which was nice because we had no idea. We just knew what we wanted and ordered. Did not take long to get the appetizer. It was good but, it did look as if the bowl was put in microwave to reheat it because of the burned edges on the bowl. We still eat it anyway and it was ok. When the salads came they were HUGE!! We asked for extra dressing on the side because it was kinda dry and the chicken was little over cooked. However we still enjoyed our outing with great service. They are open from 11am to late!! The table and booth was clean tho the door coming in had finger smudges all over but, we did not eat off the door :) Since its in the Neighborhood we will be back."}
{"text":"I chose one star because it wouldn't let me choose none. I called the store to place a to go order and was put on hold for 6 minutes. I hung up and called again, someone answered the phone and didn't speak so I waited for 3 minutes before hanging up and calling again only to have the same thing happen again. The last time I was in the restaurant to sit down and eat the service was completely shitty! I will be making sure to tell my family not to give me any more applebees gift cards or I'll go to the one at concord mills that isn't complete SHIT !!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty takeout experience. I see that many of the poor reviews are service-related. We have never eaten in the restaurant but had decent carryout which we ordered online via their website. However, no host was waiting upon arrival and hubby had to stand and ask around awkwardly to find out where to go for pick up (in the back. Go through side entrance). We live about 10 minutes away and they estimated 15 minutes for the following food to be ready:  -2 item app combo: crispy green beans and pretzels with beer cheese and honey mustard  -American Standard burger with BBQ fries  -4-cheese Mac with honey pepper chicken  Everything arrived home hot, fresh and crispy (where applicable). The green beans came without the advertised aioli, so we used ranch from home. They were tasty and did not have as much breading as the Friday's version, in a crispy delish way. The pretzels were \"meh\" but the accompanying beer cheese was awesome.   The burger was good but couldn't taste the bacon, pickles and onion that was minced and mixed/cooked into the patty. We wish that it would have come with lettuce and tomatoes like the other burgers. Ordered well done but was cooked medium.   The Mac and cheese was pretty good and a hearty helping (I have about 1/2 for leftovers). The cheese sauce is nothing unique but I like the use of callentani noodles and the bacon (which I almost asked to omit) was crispy and a welcome change of texture. The chicken sounded a bit lame... \"honey pepper chicken strip?\" I imagined them throwing a chicken strip that had been sitting under a heat lamp on top and calling it a day. The chicken was actually really tasty. Obviously crispy but the sweet/salty combo was great with the creaminess of the pasta. I wish they had they had the option of adding veggies to make it more of a complete, adult dish. We added leftover stir-fried zuchinni, peppers and broccoli and it jazzed it up a bit. The breadstick was pretty old and tasteless and not worth the calories. While it was pretty good, I don't think I would get this again. I will go back to my usual Oriental Chicken Salad or club house grill. Worth a try once, though.   All-in all, it was fresh, well made food. Some of the best carry out we have had in the last year. They offer both car delivery and you going into the carry out area in the back. Just bring cash for a tip for the car service.  *edit: we ordered take out again and were there while food was still being prepared. Even so, taco app was soggy and fries were dry, cold and stale. It was clear that they did not time our meal prep properly. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and in-laws to dinner here last evening and enjoyed a fun evening.  The service was good, and for the most part the food was excellent.  I ordered the 6 ounce sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delicious, BUT the green beans were limp and not fresh - they had hardly any taste, so they were probably frozen food.  But I'd recommend this as a good family restaurant."}
{"text":"Place sucks. They never check back to refill your drinks or see if you need more napkins. Never again!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I work a BUSY breakfast restaurant, if I could give less than one star, I would. I was a part of a party of six, we arrived at 5:30. Our order was taken around 5:50. The last two people arrived and the area they seated us did not accommodate our party, so we asked to turn the table. The manager was short, but moved the table.   This is the issue, at the time the table was moved the server said, \"let me retake the orders, they've already been put in, but just to make sure everything is correct.\" It was 6:23 and no food, no drinks have been brought out. We ask and the response from the server \"the kitchen makes the food, I just check on it and bring it out.\" We ask about the drinks and the response is \"the bartender hasn't made them.\"   So, for the next 30 minutes food and drinks trickle out. The FIRST two orders NEVER came. We asked our server, VAL and she said she would get the manager. The manager JEFF and he came out and seemed frustrated. We mentioned the first two orders haven't came out and he was so rude saying he would check and asked for the order.   After the food came out, Val was nice. Her attitude changed. They discounted our meal, but really no reason for the attitude."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location several times, but this is my first review of it.  I don't know what Applebee's is doing, but it seems like everytime I go there, the one thing I really liked the last visit is no longer on the menu.  I ended up ordering a 9oz steak with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  Food was pretty good, but nothing amazing.  Steak was cooked pretty much how I ordered it, and mashed potatoes were really good.  I only like the brocoli part of the veggies and wish I would have ordered only brocoli.  Our server was very friendly, but there were several times mostly towards the end of the night where he just didn't come around.  We waited for much too long with my Credit card out waiting to pay, and didn't see him come by to collect.  I also never got offered a refill on my drink.  Even though I had a special drink (frozen limeade), when I run out I think the server should at least ask if I want anything else to drink.  My wife and son enjoyed there food also.  Basically the food is good and I would come back, but it's nothing too special, the service can be slow at times, and the prices aren't great for what you get either."}
{"text":"-- VETERAN'S DAY DINNER --  This is the first time i've been to Applebee's in....a while  My buddies go every year for Vets day for the free dinner. This is the first i've gone with them. My mentality with free stuff especially meals from establishments is that they cut corners to damage control giving away inventory.   Very surprised with the 7oz sirloin steak dinners. The veggies were horribly distributed. I was swimming in carrots while my buddy had two.  The potatoes were average. There wasnt anything bad about them but then there was nothing good about them either. The portion size could count as a good thing but more of mediocre is still pretty mediocre.  The steak is what surprised me the most. For such a small piece of meat it had a lot of quality. Each bite was juicy from start to finish. Grilled medium rare so from start to finish and had that lively smokey flavor fresh from the grill.  They cut corners from the sides but wow the steak was awesome."}
{"text":"The entrees are not that great. I have ordered a steak and pasta here before and they're nothing special.  I would say that their best items are the appetizer items. I love the sampler,especially! It has yummy spinach and artichoke dip, spicy boneless wings, mozzarella sticks, carrots and celery, and quesadillas. You might as well just order this as your meal.  Staff is nice."}
{"text":"Was never a fan, except for the amazing blondie brownie dessert. My visit yesterday was pretty good. The server was friendly, and very accommodating to questions, requests etc., I have multiple food in tolerances. In the end I had a plain cheeseburger without bun and plain sweet potato fries. Both were very good. Burger was a bit small but cooked right and clearly very fresh."}
{"text":"I was there a couple days ago. i have to say, the service was just like the food, horrible. My boneless wings were no where near cooked, and my steak was very dry. i will not be going back ever again."}
{"text":"Horrible (that's an understatement) Service. Sat and waited for 20 minutes for someone to even come to the table! Never going back."}
{"text":"Just look at the other terrible reviews and you will understand. Like the others, if I could give a 1/2 a star or no star, I would have. This restaurant needs to call it quits. It took them an hour and a half to get us a salad and boneless wings. The manager and staff are rude and never apologized for continuous mistakes from the beginning to the end of the meal. Someone tell those waiters their memory isn't as good as they believe. Get a freaking pad of paper and write it down!! You aren't impressing anyone! (lol)  I will never go back and have been telling everyone else the same. End of Rant."}
{"text":"This was our first time here on a Sunday night, and it wasn't very busy but the service was awful! Took forever to be seated, and then our server disappeared for a good while.  Food was better than expected ( we ordered the steak and it's usually hit or miss here ) but tonight it was better than previous visits."}
{"text":"Cheap food, decent service. Just what you would get out of your typical Applebee's. I would say my favorite thing is the dessert, try the blondie. Pro tip: they're open really late and have happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst experience I have had here. Not only was our waitress \"DJ\" rude, but she messed up my order. I asked for no pico and I ended up getting it. It'd be understandable if they were busy, but they were completely dead. And when I she asked how things were I said I had gotten pico on it. She offered to have it remade and then tried to charge me twice for her mistake. When we said we had gotten charged twice for it, then she said she can have it removed. But she had said nothing when she gave us our receipt with the double order on there. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Crapplebee's....that's what my friends and I call this place.  Unfortunately, it's one of the only restaurants in Laveen, so we keep dragging ourselves back there, just because we are lazy and are sick of McDonald's.  Food is hit or miss.  You may wonder why they keep changing their menu, it's because their food is usually horrible, so they have to.  The food is not horrendous, and it's priced ok, so that is why we keep going back.  Oh yeah, AVOID the karaoke nights.  Actually, no, if you wan't a good laugh, you should go.  It was a lot of Barry Manilow, and slow, soul music, and horrible music.  It gave my friends and I some well-needed drunken entertainment."}
{"text":"The bourbon street steak was bland. The bartender Marcus would be good as a waiter...maybe... but not a bartender. The manager was nowhere in sight. Applebee's has gone downhill over the years and they don't seem to care."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I realize that it all depends on who is serving, who is cooking and what you order.  We had two nice experiences here. Burgers on Monday are very good and inexpensive.  Most people were taking advantage of this special.  Another special was 2 for $20 or 2 for $25.  We got the 2 for $25 and started with artichoke dip and chips. Then we got bourbon chicken with onions and mushrooms which was very tasty and firecracker shrimp with spicy noodles. The shrimp were sparse but the pasta was surprisingly good! We had left overs for the next day too. Their desserts are good too, especially the chocolate cake with ice cream.  We used our gift cards and were very happy.  The server in the bar was friendly and attentive.  He served us quickly and with a smile and gave us drink refills right away.  I'd try this restaurant on a weeknight or weekday rather than a crowded weekend night."}
{"text":"The bar smells overwhelmingly like old, stale beer; I wonder if the floor mats have ever been cleaned. I have received good service here before but my experience eating alone at the bar was horrible. It took forever to be greeted, the bartender was unfriendly, took even longer to finally get to place my order (even though the bar was not crowded at all), and the smell was utterly unappetizing. If you come here, do not sit at the bar, your service will surely be better otherwise."}
{"text":"The service was cool, but the food...well.  I ordered a salad and the tomatoes were frozen. REALLY!!! For the main course I ordered the chicken penne pasta. It was dry with 3 pieces of chicken on top. I ended up not eating half the pasta due to no flavor what so ever. My hubby ordered the lime chicken...the rice was dry and the chicken breast was okay. It seems like the prices continue to rise while the qualify of food and portions decrease. I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It was a busy night. Therefore it is obvious that service and food may take a little longer than usual.   I don't mind having a busy server as long as they have a good attitude.  Out server was great. He was not the problem. Our wings came out extremely dry and crunchy, it is obvious that it was thrown into the frier a couple times. The wings were so dry and and crunchy they were clearly old wings.  The fries came out a while after the wings and we're dark brown. Clearly those were refried a couple times and they tasted awful.   This has been about the third time I've come and each time the wings come out tasting very old. I will not be coming back and would not recommend this location.  Food is awful.  Except for the Wong tong chicken tacos. Those are the bomb. Also, I had a Pina colada and the drink was extremely watered down.  The drink tasted more watery than it should've been.  Could have been due to the fact that the server was busy and it may have been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes.  It came out shortly before dinner was out."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Struck out a few times with initial beer and food choices being out of stock at the bar and kitchen. However, the food we ended up ordering came out as we asked: steak cooked medium, substitute steamed broccoli, and multiple food allergies noted. Our server, Alyssa B, was a true gem providing excellent customer service with an amiable attitude and sincerity to do her job well and try to make us happy.   On a blustery Tuesday night, we visited this Applebee's. The host (who was what seemed to be a very shy high schooler) seated us quickly. Within a few minutes, our server, Alyssa B, stopped by and was friendly even though it seemed she had quite a few tables that were sat in her section. Here's the low down:  1) We ordered a beer but the server had to come back and let us know it's out of stock. No worries, we ordered something else.  2) We ordered our entrees and let her know our food allergies. But she had to come back with the allergy menu because the kitchen was a bit nervous and wanted us to double check it. Again, no worries because it's better to be safe than sorry. We were good to go, or so we thought.  3) Alyssa came back once more, very apologetic, and let us know one of the entrees we picked is sold out. We ordered something different.  4) Maybe 5-8 minutes later, my order came out alone. Alyssa came by with two plates and explained that she noted we mentioned we were sharing anyway so she didn't want to make us wait even longer than we had been for the second entree. That was actually pretty great because we were hungry.   5) The second entree came out not too much afterward and was cooked medium as requested, which I was pleasantly surprised about because it's often overcooked at chain restaurants.  The food was good and the service was great. With at least 5 tables sat in seemingly a short period of time, Alyssa handled each mishap gracefully, which was duly noted and much appreciated. Heck, even after we paid and gave her a 30% tip, she swung by our table to sincerely thank us again.  I've worked in restaurants and other customer service jobs, and have witnessed both amazingly performed and poorly done work. People often leave reviews for the latter, but I prefer to do them because of the former, hence this review!  B+ for the food, A+ for Alyssa's serving skills."}
{"text":"just the same as any other? haha..  is kept clean.. service is usully friendly when we come and sit down to eat..   it's never a long wait for our food.. and the waiters are on top of refilling drinks and asking If everything's alright w/out being overbearing..  they also know their menus which is great because i hate when you ask what something on the menu consists of and getting an \"idk.. i can ask.\"  answer.  I only give them 3 stars because of an incident when I ordered curbside.  I made an online order for pickup and sent my son inside to grab the food  [being I was not presentable to the public: hence the ordering curbside] but when we get there... no ones in the curbside pick up room.  so he  sits in that little room waiting for someone to come [which mind u is visible by the bartenders at the bar]  5 min. pass and still no one comes.  so I honk and tell him to go to the front and to tell them that he's there to pick up an order.. so he comes and out and tells me that they said they were sending someone back.    waiting.. waiting....... waiting.  so I finally get out [pajamas and uncombed hair and all..] and have to tell the bartender that my son had been sitting in the -to go curbside pick up- room for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come back and give us our order.. he was very apologetic and called the lady who was supposed to be there.. to which I grabbed my food and let her know why her ass wasn't getting a tip...  if you know you have ppl picking up food........  have someone there.   food doesn't stay warm forever.  so anyway: my faves:  the quesadilla explosion salad.. and the trio thing they offer.  it's the best way to get a little bit of everything when you don't really know what you want.    ps:  the mini deserts in the cups.. the red velvet stuff.. yum."}
{"text":"Went here today with my family. Over 15 min passed and no one even took a drink order.  The table next to us told us it took them over an hour to get their food as well.  The restaurant was NOT busy.  This is how you lose business.  Walked over to Qdoba instead.  Save your time and your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Applebees is Applebees.  I have been to many, and I have been to this particular one several times.  Our inlaws are very generous when it comes to gift cards, and Applebees cards top their list.  As great as it is to have American bar food from time to time, I am also a firm believer in quick, courteous and accurate service.  No matter how good your food is, if the service side is lacking the whole experience is ruined.  Every time I have been to this particular Applebees, I have been disappointed with the wait staff.  The food takes a long time to come out of the kitchen, and the waitress/waiter are never there to refill drinks, bring a check or make sure your food was good.  This has happened during the lunch rush, dinner time, and somewhere in-between the two.  If you are coming here on a lunch break, make sure you have a full 45 minutes to sit there from start to finish...or a very understanding a lenient boss.    Food was great, if you aren't pressed for time."}
{"text":"Remember....tip well.... I always like coming to applebees, especially happy hour. Good food good prices.  The reviews are all over the place..... The bar service is slow, shouldn't be getting the food before drinks. If you need another straw or extra napkins the poor waitress has to go into the back....why can't management keep supply up front or have each waitress keep supply in apron like other  restaurants. .....poor time management which equates to slower customer service. They do need to busses tables quicker..."}
{"text":"Giving them one more chance, never really enjoyed the food before, usually too bland for my taste.  But we sat for 10 minutes when it was relatively slow as it was 4:30. At least 3 servers walked by our table more than once. People seated after us were greeted within the typical minute and still we sat.  There are many flaws I can tolerate but just stopping in after a customer is seated should be such a simple step.  Sadly it seems to be hard at this location."}
{"text":"My parents, the boy and I couldn't figure out what we wanted - so my parents landed on this. It's close to their home and they have liked things in the past.   The service was decent, but the food was... disappointing.   I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the pretzel sticks. They were really dark and appeared to be overdone. I ate half of one... no thanks. My mom tried a bite and didn't like it either.   My mom ordered the Thai shrimp salad. They were in such a rush to get our orders out, they forgot the shrimp! Seriously, it's in the name of the dish and you didn't realize it wasn't there? It was brought out shortly after, but still - shouldn't have happened.   The meals were overall just disappointing. We've all said, unfortunately, that that's the last time we'll eat there."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Applebee's, but a couple of friends wanted to meet here for happy hour. when we first walked in, the hosts seemed a little bothered, but we continued to our table. there wasn't much of a happy hour selection, and the food was pretty pricey. I had the quesadilla burger. it was okay, but it wasn't much of a quesadilla. it was more of a thin cheese crisp with little cheese on it. our waitress was great though, which kind of made up for everything else! most likely wouldn't be back though."}
{"text":"Had lunch there over the weekend, had a pleasant meal.  The Oriental Chicken Salad is always wonderful.  Waitress kept our drinks re-filled and kept checking on us.  My granddaughter had the Grilled Cheese, she enjoyed, and her drink was served a covered kids cup - which was also re-filled.  Overall a great place for a good meal."}
{"text":"Michael the server was extremely rude when he found out how big his tip was. He had the audacity to stop me before i left and question the amount i tipped him. He also made a rude remark that two of my friends heard about his tip. He talks way too close to you and spits on you when speaking. He is the reason i will no longer come here."}
{"text":"worst customer service by far! walked in didn't get greeted. waited for five minutes without getting greeted! sat ourselves down, while the hostess just watched us. sat at the table, still didn't get greeted for another five minutes. such a joke"}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here. Me and my girlfriend stop in at least once a week. We've been coming here for about a year now and have made it our place to go. The food is just like any other Applebee's, however, when you stop in as often as we do, the staff begins to recognize you. We're always treated great here, wether it be by the greeters, our server, or sometimes even the manager."}
{"text":"After being seated, never got service. Nobody came to take order for drinks, nobody came to take order food. We left after seeing other customer who came way after us being waited. We sat there at least 20 min....."}
{"text":"The food was horrible.  The service was good.  The manager was in denial and argued with me that the food was good.  If Chef Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares ate the dinner that I did he would probably have said disgusting!"}
{"text":"The fact that we arrived out of the nowhere and were treated rightly and with courtesy makes me want to go back soon. The hostess there treated us well and she was attentive of us at all times. I liked this Applebee's."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIS PLACE THE WAITERS TRY TO POCKET YOUR CHANGE!!! The first time it was 75 cents and this time it was 35 cents... I'm sitting there waiting for my change for 25 minutes and the waiter comes to my table and says \"you're waiting for 35 cents?\" UM YES!!!! No copy of receipt or anything, just takes my money and leaves. Not to mention the All American Burger does not come with any veggies and the waiter didn't specify that and just serves me a dry burger.... What the hell?"}
{"text":"I have always had quality service, quality food and full drinks at this Applebee's.  Applebee's is great and has a menu that changes every so often. They have some great low calorie meals that are filling and tasty."}
{"text":"It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \"holding back\" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.  Which hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.  A big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits."}
{"text":"Went there last night had a great time. Had to wait a few minutes it was busy for a Saturday night. Service was amazing food was fantastic. Expect a little noise around you but it's not overbearing. I like that you can pay at the table and the top right there on the screen. I really enjoyed this Applebee's and Ninas great service!"}
{"text":"Holy crap how many things can go wrong in one visit. Let me start at the top Allen and I like Applebee's so when this visit started going down hill we were worried. Our server was perfect she was busy but made time for us. The Bartender was wonderful busy but filling in where she could. Now we ordered from the happy hour menu and that's where the shit hit the fan as they say . Boneless wings were cold so we sent them back , the steak wonton tacos were cold but we ate them. The bartender bought the boneless wings out and they were hot , can you believe it they were raw as raw as raw could be. Needless to say I was not a happy camper, I did talk to the manager on duty and she was super, super nice needless to say because of how she and the server was we will be back(if the raw chicken dose not kill us)."}
{"text":"I would recommend this Applebee's location because they have great food, good service and friendly servers! The food was delicious! The steak was cooked well and tasted awesome, and the baked potato and mixed vegetables were really good too! They had very buttery tasting mixed vegetables that were surprisingly delicious! The mozzarella sticks were delicious as well! I would definitely go back to this location, and certainly recommend others to try this location! It does appear to be a very popular location though, so it was very busy. The atmosphere was still comfortable even though it felt kind of crowded with how packed the restaurant was around 7pm- 8pm. They also have happy hour from 3pm- 6pm and then from 9pm- 12am everyday, so that's worth checking out for the Long Island Iced Teas' that they serve there! I love those so much! They're very delicious!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a number of times and have always had the best service and great food.  All of the servers we've had were excellent and the manager always makes it a point to check on us and see if we need anything.  No complaints and we'll definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"The server was friendly, but she rarely stopped at our table to see how we were doing. Ordered a rare steak and it came almost well done. In fact all of our food was overcooked."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible food, the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of one is because they have good drinks for happy hour. The happy hour changes from time to time without notice and I have been disappointed to return to find my favorite drink no longer on sale."}
{"text":"I would give my experience here a 0 star if I could. The service sucked. We ordered the artichoke dip for an appetizer and 2 burgers. The waitress/bartender Amber, sucked big time. She stood at the bar chatting with a customer and ignored us. After 25 minutes and on our 2nd drink, I finally got up and went to the bar to ask if we were getting an appetizer soon. She asks me, you haven't gotten it yet? She should of realized this when she brought our 2nd round of sodas. I told her if the burgers are done, don't bring the appetizer. I watched someone coming out of the kitchen through one door with 2 plates of burgers and disappear through another door,as I saw our waitress shaking her head, no. She then brought out our appetizer, and my husband told her we don't want it now, we'll have just the burgers if they are done. We don't want cold burgers. She said I was going to wait 10 minutes to bring those out. Who the heck wants warm lettuce, tomatoes and soggy fries.? So now she brings the burgers, and my lettuce and tomato where warm from already sitting under the heat lamps and my fries were not fresh. When Amber tried to say they just came up, my husband showed her the crusty old cheese. Her response, yeah, your right. And walked away. This was at 3 pm on Monday, with 2 other people in her section. The rest of the restaurant was totally dead. I'll Never return to any Applebee's again! And, we go there just for the spinach artichoke dip!"}
{"text":"only 1 star because our server was great.  food was cold. margarita was not made correctly. listened to the servers talk at the pos machine and the table behind us where they were cashing out complain about  everything from station assignments to how  much they made that day.  even heard one complain about a customer.  another employee just walking around making uncomfortable conversation with guests.  no thanks"}
{"text":"the whole idea of applebee's really bothers me. chain restuarants that you can go to all over the country just seem weird. it seems so much more worth it to try something new and unique and risk it not being great than going somewhere that introduced that obnoxious song about   baby back ribs... oh wait, that was chiles. well, i feel the same way about that restaurant too.  the only times i came here were to do their happy hour, which is pretty good, if you can stand the atmosphere. the HH hours are pretty impressive; 3 to 7 and 10 to midnight every night of the week. other than that - gross, gross, gross"}
{"text":"we just went there because its my sons bday and left because 1st of all when we enter the lady didnt even smile she ask us how many? she grab the menu and didnt even call us...my son just followed her...we sat and she left...my husband is sooo disappointed so we ended up leaving the restaurant...if you guys dont like working in the restaurant then quit because working in a customer service world needs to have a people person skills--- and make to smile...it wont hurt you to smile"}
{"text":"Came here today a total of three of us, we ordered sandwiches with with side dishes a plain BLT and a club with no ham, no mayo and both came with HEAVY barbecue sauce  I tried to eat it to be nice but it was foul, the waitress was very nice good lady got us replacement sandwiches and looked liked she was just yelled at.  The food was horrendous all around and sadly so were the drinks!  I don't normally write reviews but i am currently on the toilet with diarrhea in pain, idk if it was revenge for asking for new sandwiches but whatever they put in it made me sick,  please don't come here its just not worth it"}
{"text":"Husband ordered online to go. Processed promptly. However, steak was horrible way to tough. Husband had rib tips which were average. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Horrendous and unfriendly service. Came in tonight as we had wanted Applebee's for some time now and thought it would be a good experience. The waitress was rude and short with us and everything but friendly. I get it, working in food service sucks but there's a reason you're working there. If you hate it then do something about it, don't treat your customers who determine your tip like crap. We will NEVER be going back here even if it is minutes from our home. How disappointing."}
{"text":"I am vegetarian and I asked the waiter about menu options for me and she told me they weren't vegetarian friendly and then proceeded to ask me if i ate CHICKEN. They took my drink for a refill and never returned it, after 20 min I had to ask for it. we got our food separate,  never got queso i repeatedly asked for. received nachos with meat, we hate running our server but after a period of time we gave up.  Had Never received the \"free refill of fries\" which does not phase me but still. I felt that it was a waste of money and I will never return. Time and money WASTED."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today, but the experience wasn't as good as in previous visits. I ordered the 8 oz. Sautter Home cabernet, yet when it was delivered, it was a small glass of wine. I complained to the waitress, who then took my glass and had the bartender add more wine to it. I wanted to get one of their lunch combo specials, specifically their broccoli cheddar soup and the chicken cavatappi for $6.99, but was told that there wasn't any broccoli cheddar soup. Instead, I had to order the lunch combo with the French Onion soup, which meant that I was charged extra for the soup because the one that I wanted wasn't available."}
{"text":"A wonderful lunch here with family. My husband ordered a beer ($5.29), along with the lunch combo of French Onion Soup and the Clubhouse Grille ($8.99) and I ordered the Sautter Home Cabernet ($6.25), along with the lunch combo with the French Onion Soup and the Cheese Chicken Cavatappi ($7.99). They delivered the smaller wine (6 oz) instead of the larger (8 oz), but the manager allowed me to have the first one and then brought me the larger one also, without an extra chart! Our waiter, Adam, was awesome and attentive!"}
{"text":"Utterly un-shocked that this place has such a bad yelp review.  Simply put...customer service matters.  No one goes to Applebees because they want outstanding food. They go because its upscale fast food, they can sit and have a beer, and there are TVs. Appetizers are good anywhere you go, and grabbing a quick burger and fries is all any Applebees is ever really good for.  Walked into the smallest waiting area I've ever seen in a sit-down establishment. 4 couples ahead of me and my wife...wait time is 10-15 minutes. Not bad right?  10 minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated. 3 couples have come in behind us in the meantime, and guess what their wait time is? 10-15 minutes according to the seasoned champion they had working as a Hostess. I start looking around and see an ample amount of tables empty...I start wondering, why the hell am I still waiting to be seated?  The second hand strikes 12 as we entered minute 15, and a gaggle (real word...look it up) of employees decide to stop their entire evening to go do a birthday song...at Applebees. With a lobby full of customers waiting to be seated...  It's 2016, isn't it common knowledge by now that no one has a birthday at Applebees? They just tell their waitress that as a joke to publicly embarrass the people they are with.  Needless to say, we walked out.  What a joke! This place has permanently lost my patronage."}
{"text":"Happy hour was not that great! They substituted club soda for sour mix. Ruined the drinks and thank goodness we had an amazing server!! Joel wanted to go above and beyond for us!! Food was not great either...disappointing compared to the Applebee's on Lebanon Church Road. Thought happy hour would have been a good idea, not so much."}
{"text":"I visited Applebee's in Goodyear and ordered a plate I have eaten at Applebee's all over the country. It was the Southwestern Chicken salad. I  was shocked and appalled at what I was served. After asking a server I was told that this is how \"they\" make this salad. I then asked for the manager who also told me that the salad is made to standards. Unbelievable! This location is way below any Applebee's standards in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is great, the atmosphere is lovely and at times enchanting if you're on a date and don't want to miss your favorite team play, yet at the same time not forget about your favorite lady ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this Applebee's since I was a little girl who would come here and only eat their amazing cheeseburgers and layered chocolate cake. I was heartbroken when said layered chocolate cake was taken off of the menu, but now that I'm of legal age, other parts of the menu have made up for this. More on that later.  I think compared to other restaurants in the chain, this Applebee's is a little bit smaller than other places, but the essentials are all there: comfy seating, a bar, TVs, and most importantly: good service. Plus, it has the essential Applebee's staple: a darn good menu. (Well, I think it's good anyway. If you like Applebee's menus in other lcoations, you'll like the one here.) In recent years it's also adopted a \"light option\" menu, which is positively delicious and provides perfect alternatives to things like that tasty but not-so-good-for-me burger I used to eat on a regular basis. Fortunately, steak with shrimp and potatoes and the perfect balance of spices on top make up for my inability to always indulge in my original favorite meal.  Also: this place is home to one of the biggest margaritas I've ever seen. Joe's Crab Shack still takes the prize for 1st place, but 2nd is no small feat (no pun intended) and this place is much closer and easier for me to get to. Also, free parking - always a big plus.  All in all, I still enjoy stopping in here for a good meal, and I plan on continuing to come here in the years to come."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I placed on online order for pick up at 1830. I arrived around 1825-i knew I would wait a cpl of minutes. Tried to pay beforehand-machine malfunction/waitress overwhelmed. Tried to pay again and she breaks down the 40 i gave her-didnt make sense. Manager comes out and says they lost my order. I'm starting to get pissed now. I had to tell them my order again plus wait an additional 30 min. After all these mishaps-wasn't offered anything other than sorry. Since I had to wait-i asked for a soda. Applebees was my favorite place but after yesterday I'm done."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of places I've been to that I've liked, A lot that I haven't liked, and one that I've hated that would be Apple bees Applebee's. Applebee's is horrible don't go. I can't believe people actually like the food at these restaurants."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Applebee's before and was greatly surprised. The location was nice, clean and updated. It was busy and there was plenty of waitstaff, we didn't have to wait at all during dinner rush which was nice. I love seeing the many neighborhood locals who know each other as I got seated, I love that feel.   Our waitress Ashley was quick to greet and get drinks and appetizers going, she did a great job to check in frequently since we wanted some happy hour pricing drinks. The menu had great simplicity and variety, our kids actually ate all their food for once, and they stayed entertained with the tablet. I tried a new brew house dish and hubby had tasty wings. The manager was so sweet, she brought out our dish and noticed the fries looked like it sat out a while so she brought us new fries. That was very kind and I love her high expectations for quality and appreciate that. Our server Ashley was great, she was sweet and attentive.  I will be back soon just for the fact that the staff were all great and the menu is something my kids will eat. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever gotten up and left a restaurant without paying.  The waitress was bad and took 10 minutes between refills.  When my meal finally came it was so cold that I ate only a few fries and 1/4 of the burger.  I waited another 10 minutes for the waitress before I got up and asked the hostess to see the manager.  She went in the back and said he'd be right out.  I waited another 5 minutes for the manager before I finally just gave up and left. I was too hungry/pissed to waste my time any longer.  Applebee's is a good place to eat, but skip this location. I'll drive another 10 miles out of the way to avoid this one."}
{"text":"Meh experience. This is not the first time we ate at this Applebee's, but it was our first on a Saturday. Silly us, what were we thinking?  Our wait time wasn't too bad. 15 minutes and because the weather was fabulous (Arizona winters), we waited on the benches outside. Our host was so to call us in when we were up next.  It was crowded and busy. Our server seemed really scattered and brusque. When she took our order and came by to check on us, she always seemed to be in a hurry. Because of that, she didn't seem to comprehend what we ordering at times. Fortunately, when she repeated our order, we caught her mistake.  She did refill our lemonades and teas (the unsweetened tea with mango and peach syrups was great) frequently. We ordered the unlimited riblets, chicken strips and fries and were sorely disappointed that the riblets were very dry. My daughter couldn't eat it, so she changed to chicken strips which were okay. The fries were decent.  Our Asian chicken salad was smaller that I remembered. It was tasty and the chef remembered to keep the almonds off.  Our chicken wonton tacos were the star of the evening. We had 4 orders of those. The beer cheese and pretzels were okay. The pretzel sticks were not enough to finish the beer cheese and was on the skimpy side. I would have taken a picture, but I forgot to charge my phone. My bad."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and food presentation lacking in attention to details. Our family headed to Applebee's near the Mesa Gateway Airport. We always love the Wonton Tacos which drew us here.   It started out well enough. Casey, our server was pleasant and service was customary then. We ordered one entree and 5 appetizers. My daughters split the macaroni and cheese with bacon and honey chicken. They enjoyed it.   Two of our three Wonton Tacos were not finished well. They usually  top the slaw on the tacos. Two of the tacos did not have slaw in it. Another problem with detail was the spinach artichoke dip. The kitchen had left a fairly large woody piece of artichoke in the dip.  When Casey came to check on us, she asked, \"How's everything?\" When I asked that she provide feedback to the chef that the tacos were not dressed correctly and there was a large chunk of woody artichoke in my dip. She scoffed at me and rolled her eyes dismissively. \"Okay.\" she said and walked off.   Training. I know that she was probably trained by management to ask customers how everything was going, but if servers are not interested in feedback then should at least pretend to be pleasant. Also, if you don't want feedback, don't ask the servers to ask customers how things are going. We left the restaurant disappointed with the service.  I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"AppleSleeze strikes again.  Not great service or food.  Asked for lemons, got none. Got bacon in salad but asked for non. Got several apps we wanted first but all food came out together. Portions were tiny for the price. Used to love this franchise but I'm good if we don't come back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour. Today, I went to Applebee's for HH with my colleagues. My son tagged along as it was on our way home. I was hoping to capitalize on half-price apps, but Son was hungry and wanted shrimp. We opted for the Pick 2 for $25, 2 select entrees plus a select app. We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks, Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp with Potatoes and the new Butcher's Meat and Potatoes.   The Mozzarella Sticks were okay, crispy with an okay marinara sauce. My son enjoyed them very much. The Butcher's Meat and Potatoes portion was noticeably smaller than the portion of the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp. The mash potatoes and gravy was nice. The beef tips were on the tough and chewy side. My son's chicken was tough and dry. It could've used a sauce or gravy. The shrimp looked good. The potatoes were nice and crispy, but they were under seasoned. The skillet was sizzling and looked delicious, but the actual meal was underwhelming.  Our server was swamped with our party. We had 2 tables, a total of 12. At one point he seemed frazzled when he wasn't he was given a food order, but he regained his composure and explained that he was trying to get the drink order in first. At the end of our meal, he wasn't on top of getting our bills ready for us to pay. I observed that several in our party looked impatient.  Meh, was probably an accurate description for me, but my son rates it an okay. Okay, Taric, I did order entrees, and you can laugh at me."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't mind country music, but when did Applebee's turn into a country bar? The music was loud and took away from what you want...good conversation. You have to speak up just to be heard...hey, manager of this Applebee's, do you read these reviews? Yes, it did takes long time for even drinks to be ordered."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hit or miss experience from the experience of my wife and myself. Sometimes the good is just right. Other times the food is terrible! Lady evening my daughter and I took my wife to Applebee's for their 2 for $20 offer.   When we finally got out steak dinners, the potatoes were cold and the steak was tough as can be with next to no taste for my wife and myself.  For my daughter, her hamburger was supposed to have three strips of bacon. It had none AND no lettuce or anything else! To add to it, the burger was dripping with grease in abundance!  To go one step better, the French fries were hard like they were sitting open to the air for a few hours. In essence, that was one seriously botched effort for my wife's birthday.?  When their food is done right it's the greatest but when it's not, well, do t say no one told you!"}
{"text":"waited 25 min for a dry entree and there was nobody here. then sat another 20 min and counting after finishing the \"food\" waiting on the check"}
{"text":"Best Applebees ever! Maggie is awesome! Never an empty glass at the bar. Food is great."}
{"text":"Had a great experience thanks to bartenders Johnny and Andrew!  They were amazing and made our visit!  Good food and drinks too but having good service will keep us coming back thank you!"}
{"text":"I still love Applebee's, but because of a to-go experience I had, and an awful manager, I will never step foot in this location again.   Long story short I ordered to-go and requested the order be done 20 minutes in the future. This caused a big fuss at the restaurant, no one was able to ring me up. They had to call two managers...etc. So the next to-go I asked for the order to be ready ''as soon as possible.'' The computer tells you to pick the food up in 15 minutes.   When I got to the restaurant Jesus says to me ''Your to-go order is almost ready!'' Great, I said, and sat down. A few minutes later I hear Jesus saying to the cooks ''You didn't make that to-go order?'' He then came around to me and asked me if I placed the order to be ready at 4:36 (this was noon'ish). I said no, I had placed the order to be ready as soon as possible. And I explained what happened before. Needless to say they didn't have my order.  Soon, Athena appears and makes things much worse, basically calling me a liar, and saying that my waiting wasn't a problem. I don't make to-go orders so I can sit in the restaurant another 20 minutes. If Athena KNEW anything about this restaurant, she would know there is a drop down box when you order, with 10 minute increments. It's literally impossible for me to have placed this order to be ready at 4:36. But I still got the blame.   I wrote corporate to tell them what a sucky employee they have. She basically has no idea of her job, and turns around and blames customers. I think I see why so many Applebee's are closing all over the place. I can spend $30 on lunch and be insulted elsewhere, thanks."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with friends. We were seated and got drinks. We got our appetizer promptly. Waited for another part of our party, and that was no problem. As soon as the others arrived, the server avoided our table, stopped swinging by for refills on drinks, and would beeline around our table to hit the ones across and behind us while the little tablet thing was flashing for service on ours.  When 3/4 of us had run out of drinks and had put in another order, she finally came by and told us that the tablet \"didn't work\" and wasn't putting in our drink requests (4 waters, a mixed drink, a tea, and a soda). We had told her that we had flagged her over twice (she walked right by us to chat up another table) and had asked a hostess/another server for assistance. She forgot half of the drinks, wasn't able to make a regular lemon- or limeade for us, and continued to avoid our table for check-ins throughout the meal, despite stopping by at other tables next to or across from ours. When we had issues with our food (the salmon being charred to almost burnt), the wrong thing being brought out, no condiments for a plate (sour cream and A1 for steak and baked potato) we finally asked for a manager to come by. He was kind enough to have a new piece of salmon brought out and saw that not one but all four of us had empty glasses and had been asking for service and the waitress was chatting with people she seemed to know and was giving them personal info (\"here's my cell #, you call me later!\") which may have been why she wasn't stopping by our table at all. He may have spoke to her, because after she did actually stop by our table for more than 10 seconds to refill our drinks and explain some of the desserts. We got the chocolate cake and a sundae shooter, both of which were delicious and more than enough to share.  The customer service was really lacking. I don't know if the server was really off her game the day we went in and she really wanted to catch up with old friends, but she really neglected our table. We also had issues with how food was cooked, with a chicken breast and salmon both overcooked--the salmon burnt. The steaks were purposely asked for on the rare side, so that was a saving grace, but it is something to caution against for the skillet-type meal.   The manager on duty really saved this from being an all-out fiasco. The desserts were good, the steaks were good, the mozzarella sticks were good. I ordered chicken and shrimp with roast potatoes on a skillet. The potatoes were dry and hard, the chicken was overcooked and dry--it was bland. Refills were hard to come by, anything else on the grill has to be ordered underdone or will be charred. They had a good deal for the meal, but with the service and the subpar quality on some of the food, I would pass."}
{"text":"I came here on Halloween night. Service was great. Manager and bartender was great as well. Yes it's a chain restaurant, but I'm all about customer service. I'm confused about folks complaining about portion size- heck eat slow and let the food digest. Then again obesity is #1 factor in America. I ordered the chicken finger basket which was to much for me( i threw most of it away-I was full), and by all means I'm not a toothpick. The bartender that was from west Virginia and was cool  as hell and knew how to make one of my favorite drinks- the Baltimore zoo-which is two drink in one. Boy that drink was bring back memories."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give this place NO stars. We were seated quickly, asked for water which came in filthy glasses and the straw already in the cup (huge deal to me). Anyway, then asked for ice tea which came in a similarly filthy glass and tasted like dirty water,  oh and by the way the water tasted like pool water. I mean this place was gross. I had enough and just asked to cancel my food order, tipped and left. Just don't go unless this is ur kind of place. I just wanted to have a quick lunch with my sweetheart who worked in the area. Bad idea."}
{"text":"Waited at least 20 minutes to even get water. Took another 10 to bring it out. Ordered an appetizer and it didn't even come out at all before or with my order. My friend ordered a burger specifically without onions and they still brought out his order with onions and other ingredients he also specified leaving out. His burger was burnt, patty half way off of a soggy bun. It's 6:30, been here for an hour now, and they still have yet to bring his order out correctly. Server seems overwhelmed with even just a small amount of customers on her floor. This location SUCKS. And I usually love Applebee's. I would save your time and never come to this location. ...and they just brought his order out with onions agaiiinnnn. Wtf?? HORRIBLE"}

{"text":"After years of swearing this place off like the plague, I went back Friday night.  Why?? A gift card for Christmas.  The good part is it wasn't the ordeal I remember.  Actually I hadn't ever been to this location before, but definitely smile every time I pass the CLOSED store in Chandler.  Food and service were as expected.  I didn't expect much and they fully complied."}
{"text":"I should have known better!  Every restaurant, regardless of city and state seems to have issues.  Our party of four stopped here for a leisurely weekday lunch - showing up around 1:30.  We were promptly seated and our server was very nice and friendly.  We finally ordered: soups, sandwiches, and salads.  After what seemed an eternity, three of us were served.  Our waiter offered an apology for the kitchen, returned five minutes later with another, and once more with a third apology.  After 15 minutes the manager appears with the missing dish \"at no charge.\"  Come on folks!  It was only soup & salad, and for that we waited 30 minutes!!"}

{"text":"Ever go to a restaurant and wonder why do I keep going back! Being so close to home, we always come to this location.  We had actually stopped eating Applebee's because of the horrendous service.  A few day's ago we decided to try it again.  Finally, we found a server that was pleasant, our order was perfect. We had to still wait for our food,  but at least this time we didn't have the disappearing service.  He kept coming out and saying that he was sorry.  Thankfully we understand that he has nothing to do with cooking.  He offered to buy our dessert. Our glasses remained full at all times.   The 3 star's are for the cooks Steve/steven we give you ***************. We decided to only visit when he is there!  For the little click of waitresses in the corner,  you might put food on our table there BUT remember that we put the food on yours at home!!! Stop the comments,  just because white I'm doesn't mean I CAN'T UNDERSTAND SPANISH! !!! I was raised that it's rude to speak Italian around people that don't understand it!! Maybe you should try this! !!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's applebees so I already knew what to expect. I personally prefer Chili's, but grandma wanted to go here. I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. I ordered a steak off the 2 for $20 menu and it had no seasoning whatsoever. Even the gobs of A1 I used didn't help. It came with veggies and mashed potatoes which I got \"loaded\" for an extra $1.99. Loaded comes with bacon and cheese, but there was hardly any bacon and the cheese wasn't even melted. The sweet and spicy boneless wings I got for my appetizer were good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here and not busy but service sucks.  Waiters are very slow and not attentive."}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down. Point blank period. The health department needs to be called...someone..I've never eaten at any Applebee's before but my aunt got me a gift card so I figured I'd use it. The bar was full of dirty dishes. The managers walked around with drinks in their own hands and no one would help me after multiple attempts. The place was dirty the carpet was sticky and the restaurant looked contaminated. I should've left the food there, hopefully I won't get sick. I'll definitely be calling their corporate office to beg them to bulldoze the place.   I'd really like to take the one star I gave back...but if I can't it's only because they have a place to park your car. That's about the only thing this place has going for it."}
{"text":"From one visit to the next some things have not improved. This time it was the Sizzling Double Barrel Whiskey Sirloin ordered by our guest. He ordered it medium rare yet it came out sizzling well done! Now what? It was more than 15 minutes until his medium rare steak was delivered. So I had another drink! Now the bar tab equals the food bill. Lacey, our server was nice enough but not familiar with the wine menu. Luckily, no problem ordering whiskey on the rocks for me. I tipped $20. on a $77. check. We get gift cards from time to time and will go back hoping against hope for that great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Food was very good. The manager that was working Friday night was the best I've ever encountered. Waitress  was very friendly. Will definitely be going there again."}

{"text":"Our waitress was amazing and the service was great. The food was terrible. We got the all you can eat chicken tenders and riblets. The fries were cold and hard and the chicken tenders were fried entirely to hard."}
{"text":"Are y'all hiring?? It seems like your understaffed for a non busy restaurant. Really pissed off came here with 2 friends for a small grad dinner. Mind there about 5 servers on the floor one checked our id and ordered drinks I forgot her name just like she forgot about our table for 20 mins. We're sitting there trying to get the other servers attention that's just walking around looking for things to do rather than doing something. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Poor service, cooks are slow, staff is running around dropping mother duckers (edited for public viewing), and having quite the giggle. Food was average.  Place is half empty and well know I understand why."}
{"text":"Excellent Service. I am usually not a fan of Applebee's food. Of the corporate chain food restaurants Applebees has great deserts but usually below par for dinner entrees. But this Applebees has amazing service and an excellent staff. Definitely the best atmosphere of any restaurant in the area and definitely a much better bar than any in the area. I would recommend going here before any other Applebees from California to New York. The bar staff has excellent service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night around 6pm, was seated almost immediately by The host, Greg.  He took our drink and appetizer order without needing to write it down.  He was extremely courteous and attentive throughout our stay.   The appetizers arrived quickly and they were fresh and hot !!  We ordered a sampler and an additional appetizer.  Boneless wings, spinach and artichoke dip, wonton chicken tacos, and mozzarella sticks.  They were all delicious and filling.  A server named Matthew took our entree order.  He was quick and on his A-game.  We ordered the 8oz Sirloin steak with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and 4-cheese Mac and the three cheese Chicken Cavatappi.     Everything was hot and delicious. We were extremely impressed with the staff and the food.    (This is a super late post,  that ended up in my drafts somehow)"}
{"text":"Yeah, the service here sucked.  As an Army veteran, I patronized this place for the free appreciation meal.  The hostess was nice and accommodating, and the blonde brownie dessert came out perfectly.  The fried shrimp and fries were okay.  One server greeted me on the fly as if she would take my order, but then another introduced herself as my server.  The new one seemed to have tables on the other side of the restaurant, so I wish the first one had taken my order because she seemed to be on top of things.  My server gave minimal service at best.  I had to ask yet another server nearby to get a refill and extra napkins.  She did so with a fake, disingenuous courtesy that irked me.  I asked whether the restaurant was short-staffed, which she denied and gave me some, lame explanation about a shift change, although I did understand what she meant.  I have server experience, and I had been a lunch shift closer myself.  The difference is that I would not have given minimal service, or given insincere responses.  I still tipped both servers, but I let them know the service sucked @$$.  I did not bother to tell the manager, because I got the impression my feedback would have fallen on deaf ears.  After all, this is Applebee's.  In the end, the free food hardly seemed worth it, and I really did not feel any appreciation as a military veteran, other than getting the special, limited menu."}
{"text":"We been coming to this location for the past 7years. I am so pleased every time we come. They know our names and they are super friendly specially our bartender he serves our drinks even before we order them.  5 stars. Keep up the great work And customer service."}
{"text":"Great bar to hangout at after work.  The bartenders know you and your drink by name!  Happy prices are great as well as their daily specials."}
{"text":"I've been to three Applebee's, all of which are 40 minute drive from where I live and this is definitely one of my favorite Applebee's locations. The servers are very friendly and attentive, the food is delicious, orders are accurate and the coffee is fresh. My only complaint is how wide open the windows are, which can be a bit annoying during late afternoon in the summer. It would be nice is there were dimming blinds but overall this is a great restaurant and the only mid-price casual restaurant in this area of town."}
{"text":"This Applebee's was a very odd meal experience! To get things started, our waiter had a name tag, but instead of having a regular name, the tag itself just read \"Name\". Now I am not sure if that is foreign but it led to a lot of confusion and was hard to order seriously. A member of our party ordered the \"Apple Chimi Cheesecake\". Confused on what \"chimi\" is, she made an attempt to inquire that curiosity onto \"Name\". The attempt, however, fell through due to the name tag, she didn't feel comfortable to ask. We also had several rounds of lemon water. Also from our booth we heard several shrieks coming from the kitchen! What a scare! We were confused about it. Was everyone okay? Was anyone hurt? The screams had no follow up context so we had to assume that the coast was clear and it was okay to be there... The lemons I expected to be juicer than served, and they had more seeds than the average lemon (More GMOS???) which led to the annoying picking-seed-out-of-straw-act, a hatred of mine! The food was very good, my rating would be higher if we did not have a peculiar experience at this location. Overall, we got what we ordered and it was clean! Customer service was sure a smidge bizarre. This is a good place to go if you are in need of a laugh and a story to tell"}
{"text":"Went to eat with my best friend. Everything was going great. We were getting ready to go but then I decided to order desert. Michelle k was our server. The service was ok but here is where she blew it. She placed my order in at 5:30pm. I didn't not get my order until 5:50 after I had asked the busser for my order. Someone else brings out the dessert and the ice cream is pretty much melted. Seriously. We told the busser that we wanted another ice cream. Apparently he asked someone else to bring it to us. After waiting for another  10 minutes we said that's it. We were on our way to speak with a manger and he comes running out with the ice cream. Apparently that location has a problem with communication. Thank you Applebee's."}
{"text":"Take a bow (was he the Gardner? or did they just call him that?)... you make me wana YELP.   The world of Yelp has you to thank for my relentless need to speak my mind actually hitting the computer screen.  May I add, for every bad review I will counter balance with a good review.  It's was an amazing day visiting with my BF Mrs. Bunny Brown.. the Vegas air was just right and my mouth recently quenched with Jager, was not too dry.  The mood was right until my run-in with the Manager of Applebee's.  The state of California requires you to surrender your old license (meaning they stamp it) and give you a DMV certificate.  Going on age 36, I did not think twice to show my Nevada license not expiring till Nov 2011 and an official paper from California legally stating my age, ssn, address, everything a stable business could want.... just for a simple shot of Jager on my nail outing with the best friend from high school.  I believe as a good manager he studied all of my documents and could have easily been proven as a just decision maker in court, had he obliged, but chose to be an arrow in our ass and deny our one drink wonder.  Not to say he was wrong, according to his protocol, but come on... Vegas is all about the service right?  Just another prick wanting to stab harsh reality in another girl's fun fantasy, I thought I had outgrown the ID phase.  I'm sorry for his unhappiness and for my wanting to say my peace."}
{"text":"I can understand why the LOW mark on this place.. Sitting at bar I have not been acknowledged once after the change in shift..  Money on counter, menu on counter 3-4 people and ZERO SERVICE... Guess I'm not eating here today..!!!  I guess they don't like locals or maybe just serving Customers..!!  Even management has no eye for detail... Might understand if busy, but come on ... Only 3-4 of us .. Sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with friends after work or on a late weekend night. They have \"reverse\" happy hour after 10pm and 1/2 price apappetizers and drink specials. This location does have outdoor dinning."}
{"text":"They have \"reverse\" happy hour after 10pm and 1/2 price appetizers plus drink specials. They also have Karaoke on certain nights of the week - in 2011 they had it on Tuesday nights but as of 2013 they've been doing Karaoke on certain Fri, Sat, Sun.  They also have Bud, Bud Light, and Coors on tap for $3 ALL DAY LONG.  This is as of Dec 2013.    To all you fuddy-duddys typing bad review on this place, you should realize that this location is on one of the busiest corners in the Gilbert/Mesa area, so cool your jets and stop acting likely fat grumpy self-important little pigs. (run-on sentence, I know)  Apple Bees is suppose to be a fun place to eat and spend time with friends/family or a drunken stuper.  I eat here often enough to know that your servers are constantly hustling to get your order out to you. They don't want to piss you off - they need your tips.  So be kind to your servers where ever you go....or they'll spit on your food, or worse...TRUE TAT!  P.S. I'm not in the food industry but know plenty of people who are~"}
{"text":"Wow Applebee's how much smaller can u make tour portions ? The artichoke spinach pasta with what a 2 oz chicken breast, for that price you could afford a bit more food and the brisket tacos thank gosh for a bunch of tomatoes and cheese to hide the fact of maybe one ounce of meat per taco.  I always enjoyed the taste of your dishes but as you sizes shrink and prices keep going up we will have to rethink the value you offer in your meals..."}
{"text":"Our experience was horrible tonight. It's been a while since we have been here and today was a great reminder why. We ordered our appetizer and about 10 minutes later ordered our steaks. Both arrived at the same time awfully quick. The food overall was very bad. My mashed potatoes were cold and my steak tasted more likes defrosted old meat. My fianc√©'s potatoes were overcooked and really dry.  $55 bucks down the drain. Save to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and son both had the steaks with different sides; Baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, broccoli, and mac and cheese. For the appetizer we had barbecue boneless chicken wings. All the food was amazing and cooked to our satisfaction. My wife also had a pina colada which she said was very good. The only issue would be with our waitress Dietra. She wasn't very personable. She just dropped off our drinks and food and never asked us how anything was. Whenever she brought us a plate or drink she just set it down without really paying much attention to us at all. Will definitely come back for the food but get another server next time."}
{"text":"Consistent service @ the bar w Chuck pouring drafts and mixing up fruity delights. Decent food - don't expect great. Lots of under 500 calorie and Weight Watcher items. Several tv's to watch games. You'll find everyone from book-reading wives that didn't want to cook to laborers grabbing a cheap steak & a few cold ones to huge celebrations filling many tables. It's a great community asset for many.  The Ritz, it ain't."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location yesterday and received the worst service ever!!! The waitress incorrectly took our order. Appetizers we're waiting to be delivered to the table and we're cold upon arrival entrees we're missing fries and salads we're ordered incorrectly. The waitress didn't bother to pick up the dirty plates or refill beverages my husband had to ask for another water she said ok than went to socialize at the bar forgetting his water. Worst service ever!!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with the previous reviews: dirty plates, poor presentation and the food is not good. Way overpriced for the experience"}
{"text":"This was one of thee worst Applebees's I have EVER been to. First, when we were seated the girl put us in a section all the way on the other side of the restaurant. There were plenty of open tables/boothes that we could've sat in. It was about 4p in the afternoon on a Sat and it wasn't busy at all. It took about 10 min for someone to approach our table  to order drinks. Our waitress ended up being Natasha. She must've gotten lost in the restaurant because she didn't come back often. We ordered drinks and the 2 for 20 special. When I received my steak, it didn't look good. The outside looked \"pale/light brown\" and it had very few grill marks. I go to taste it, and it tastes rubbery. I ended up only eating my potatoes and broccoli out of fear of getting sick. We also ordered dessert which was surprisingly good.When Natasha seen that I didn't eat the steak, she brought the manager out. I let him kbow my ordeal and he was kind enough to remove the 2 for 20 off of the receipt. I have never had this experience at an Applebee's before and I definitely won't be returning to this location. They should find better workers that actually want to work."}
{"text":"My first time going to Apple bees I was impressed with the setting and the food. It became my favorite restaurants afterwards. I especially love the Trio Appetizer. It's a great meal and at a good price. Their wings are the best. Their fries are excellent. The service there is pretty good and most of them are friendly. I like Applebee because of their food, service, and a great place to hang out and eat."}
{"text":"The service was great, I love my server!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in to grab a quick bite before the Cubs game. We sat in the bar area at a table. Our original server disappeared after taking our order. (didn't get her name) Someone else brought out our food and then we didn't hear from anyone for quite awhile after that. A new waitress came on shift at 5pm and had to deal with everything that the previous person left her. She took care of us and apologized several times about the previous waitress who disappeared. (wasn't her fault!) If someone's shift is ending they need to tell the next person taking over as well as their customers. Communication is very important in this business.  The food was ok. We ordered regular burgers with cheese and mine had bacon. I got through about half my burger and then bit into several gristles. I had one good piece of bacon and the rest were not cooked enough. The fries thankfully were very good.  We've eaten at this location several times in the past, but this visit was not the greatest. Hopefully future visits will be better."}
{"text":"The food was okay but their menu had down way down what from it use to be. Since a it's just me and my son our waiter has only come three times to our table. Drinks, order and brought food..but the table in front of us has two young women and you couldn't drag him away from their table. Maybe if I waved a 20 dollar bill at him. I mean I get it but come on.. I clocked him at 10 mins per eveytime he goes to that table! We have a horrible experience at an apples bees just last week so we thought we would try a different one. Guess not! Applebee's will not be our friendly neighborhood joint any longer."}
{"text":"My husband and son came in to this Applebee's this afternoon and received the worst service he has had ever in his life. I had to write his review because I was so upset seeing him so upset when he came home. They were sat right away but it took 30 mins until someone came to the table oh wait no he had to get up and ask the hostess for service. She quickly brought them drinks l. Thank you for that. She said she let a manager know. Then the waitress Wendy finally came around to asking them if they were ready to order. They ordered and then a little while later the food came out and Not one person came to the table to at least apologize.  \"I'm very busy in the back\" was the excuse he got from Wendy.   It made me so upset that my husband was so upset about what happened I had to call. A manager answered and apologied several times about what happened and comped their meal but I am sure that this  Applebee's is out for us from now on."}
{"text":"closed no longer open for business!! EDIT. Navigation led us to old site,..New building is 1000 ft down!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Atmoshere is a bit dated.  But, they make a great classic Margarita with Reposado and fresh lime juice."}
{"text":"Met some friends here tonight, waited over 40 minutes for drinks, the server got our order wrong overall not happy until....one of the managers came by and helped correct the situation.  I was in the hospitality industry a while ago and understand that most mistakes can be corrected with some understanding and respect. I will be back again only because what happened can happen anytime but the way managers handled this was a cut above what was expected.  Can't talk about the food since it was cold so the next visit will be all about the grub"}
{"text":"they get up to a 3 only for  their customer service. I used to love applebees but their \" upgrade\" on food is just the opposite... and drink prices unless you get their     pre-mixed stuff is above any regular bar price. I don't know who the are trying to fool... just too bad.."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars because of the amazing service. Our waiters name was Hugo. He was so polite and quick. The food was amazing and came out fast."}
{"text":"Eat at Applebee's having the shrimp was very good. Server was Debbie fantastic job. Also having the 4 cheese Mac & chicken! Did not give a 5 because of the plating of the shrimp just horrible!! But very clean! Mac & cheese also very good!!"}
{"text":"I was an Applebee's fan but do not waste your hard earned money eating at this location. My girlfriend and I went to this location and with few customers the service and food quality were absolutely horrible. Applebee's corporate needs to be aware that they have wasted their money investing in this building and expense to staff. What a tremendous disappointment. I will never return."}
{"text":"This review is based on drinks and apps. I love coming here late night with friends. Everything is reasonably priced and tastes good. They do a happy hour and 1/2 priced apps at this location so you really can't beat it."}
{"text":"Got surprised by dinner when I got home.The steak was ordered medium well and I couldn't cut it with a knife and fork (Over cooked).Onion rings were a side order,Under cooked tried 3 different rings and each was doughy, Baked Potato was still half cooked even after I put it in microwave to cook it longer.He ordered the 3 cheese chicken meal and it didn't look close to picture,chicken  burnt chicken and  elbow noodles were hard. Would we order from here again?Nope...3rd Bad experience in less than 90 days!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very disappointed with our service at this location. We sat at the bar in which the bartender took at least 15 minutes to acknowledge that we were even sitting there. He ordered a beer and I got an ice water until I chose my drink. . Bartender never took notice of us again. My husband had an empty glass for about 20 minutes. Bartender never once asked if I wanted something else. We ordered our food, after having to ask if we could do so. Heads up... the blazing bacon burger came out with 2 pieces of bacon and no BBQ ranch sauce (as described in menu) my husband had to make his own after having to ask for BBQ sauce. I subbed fries for onion rings and got 4 way over cooked rings total.. REALLY!?! Bartender still never asked if we needed anything else or if everything turned out ok. Keep in mind it was the very beginning of happy hour, it would be a whole other story if it was a packed house. It was not. My husband did finally get his second beer, half way thru our meal. Probably won't be back for a very long time"}
{"text":"This place is no good!!!!!!!!! We ordered appetizers that came out cold. The beer I had was cool NOT cold. The wife and sister ordered food which came out fine but by the time we got utensils and napkins which was 8min after getting the food, the food was cold. That's also asking for silverware numerous times. Upon receiving the silverware, it was dirty!!!!!UGH!!!!  Stopped going there previous to this trip about a year in and half and decided to give it another try thinking it would be different. Nope!!!!!! Sorry Applebee's you will never see us in there again."}
{"text":"This place is the pits. Such a nice area but, the place is run like the corner getto. The managers only hire young servers but, leave out the experienced older servers. Food being served in a timely and accurate manner is much more important. Everytime I eat there the servers are getting my order wrong. I'm not going to go there until they get more experienced servers. GET IT RIGHT PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Jake that does Car side to go is amazing. He never gets my order wrong. He's really nice. I hate to order when on his days off."}
{"text":"It was a very busy Friday night there ,we stopped in for a quick appetizer.  I haven't been to a Applebee's in a while. We got waited on pretty quickly. I had the fried green beans. Which were pretty good. What we didn't like was the restaurant smelled bad. But our waitress was friendly and quick. Oh I looked up the calories on the green beans 920calories wow!"}
{"text":"We decided to have have a late dinner here. There doesn't seem to be that many choices in Surprise in that area. We were seated quickly and our waitress got our drinks quickly. She was pleasant and friendly. I had a shrimp salad and my husband had a burger. My salad was OK , fresh but not alot of flavor. My husband loved his hamburger. He was happy!! So that was a good Applebee's experience!"}
{"text":"Went for late night.  Steak was over cooked and the baked potato under cooked.  Never saw our waitress after she dropped off our food until we asked for the check.  My husbands mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken was more breading than chicken and the 4 cheese mac and cheese was lacking cheese.  Won't be back. Lots of honey pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Good service and food always is prepared well and has good flavor! They always have really creative and tasty pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Had the Santa Fe salad (half order) and tomato soup.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"The service was great, out waitress was great my fiance enjoyed her food my food was ok until I ended up in your bathroom vomiting up the whiskey burger that was not fun at all not sure if my food was completely cooked tasted a bit mushy in parts the fries tasted stale as well this is the second time in my life I've got sick from a burger at an Applebees other time was when I was younger I avoided the restaurant up until last night.   Again really appreciate the great service though thanks for the hospitality"}
{"text":"Not impressed. After waiting ten minutes for drinks twenty minutes to have our order taken and an hour for food we found out they were out of baked potatoes. This disappointment, long wait, and disorganization led to us being quite annoyed. After voicing our annoyance to the manager we received nonstop glares from our server. While we enjoy Applebee's we won't be returning to this particular franchise."}
{"text":"6:15 pm Saturday May 30th.   Walked in with my husband who is half paralyze walking slow with a cane. No one greeted us then guy came to the desk and said this way, he was  taking us to the far right end of the restaurant when I stopped him and told him about my husband!  A booth was available only a few steps from the entry that I asked to be seated at.  The short cute short girl sitting at a table (Hostess?) running her hands thru her hair, on her phone in between customers, with backpack and music, standing and touching the railing, podium and handling and then... rolling clean utensils  in napkins, \"no hand wash\" She Asked the guy why we changed and glanced over at us. NOT ONE PERSON except our server smiled or acknowledged us!!!!  Not a pleasant experience with them giving us glaring looks!  The \"mess\" at the table at the front of the restaurant with all of her, I  assume the Hostess, her personal belongings and work.  This was  is a terrible first impression! Are your people so unhappy at there job that they forgot that a smile is usually part of the job?   This place needs customer service lessons!    Our server was Victoria!  Excellent server!  Attention, just enough friendly conversation with a beautiful smile.   Food was consistent to our last visit and considered fair!    We will be back and if I have the same experience or even close we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here Once a few years ago after going to the movies in Robinson Twp., Pit. PA.  My brother and I both got Sick !!   We haven't been back since !"}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best. Their menu is pretty good the boneless wings are the best, they have a great appetizer list.  Jules is the best server ever!!!!!!!  She is very kind, always a smile on her face. She comes and checks on you very frequently. And a model employee Applebees is very lucky to have her. Thanks"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Our waiter was nonexistent despite not being crowded. Couldn't get beverages. Burgers were greasy, buns soggy. Supposed to get refills on fries which were good, but no waitstaff. No bill because no waiter, so had to look it up on the tabletop computer ourselves and found out we were charged for some stupid trivia thing we didn't know about. Put cash on table and left. Won't go back. Don't waste your money at this location."}
{"text":"Staff just looked at us when we walked in. 4 of them including the manager was within talking distance of us and no one welcomed us. It looked like they were avoiding seating anyone. Took another 2 minutes for someone to walk over and seat us. Food was average. Boyfriend ordered the triple bacon burger and it seriously came with only two strips if bacon. Leaving, again staff were around but nobody acknowledged us let alone thanked us for coming. Manager was again one of them. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Our server was very attentive when it came to refilling our drinks, but when it came to getting a utensil or napkin that was a different story. Had to ask several times and by the time I got it my food was cold. Not returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Well organized for a very busy night. Service good so far, manager handling seating. Very pleased with the respectful service."}
{"text":"I went to Applebee at this location on veteran's day and experienced the best in food and service of any place that day. The worse was the sizzler. Applebees really made me feel like a guest of honor. I am grateful for the experience. I would recommend this location to my friends, family, and fellow veterans."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to order is the wonton chicken tacos, they are everything to me. Food & drinks are inexpensive, and it taste great. Good customer service here."}
{"text":"Another Fish n Chips Review.  I have to say that I've had the FnS here and at other Applebees locations.  It's consistent and about the only thing I ever get.   1. Fish.  It's always a generous portion.  3 filet I believe.  And it's a nice flaky white fish.  No deductions.  5 stars. 2. Batter.  It's crispy, golden and not too doughy.  Usually sticks pretty well to the fish and doesn't slide off the fish at the first bite. Could be a little lighter, and sometimes it's a little too greasy but rarely.  4 stars. 3. Chips.  Usually pretty good.  A good sized portion. Well seasoned.  4 Stars 4. Accompaniments: This is where they lose a couple points for me.  The Tarter sauce meets all the criteria, but there's no malt vinegar and they are stingy with the lemon wedges. 3 stars. 5.  X-factors.  It's a chain place.  They offer a lousy selection of beers, and slim pickin's on the whiskey or Scotch.  They do have G.L. Dortmunder. The servers at the Independence/Seven Hills location seem to be exceptionally good which makes this category a little unfair, but I can't give it more than 2 stars here. Sorry but this place is a lousy bar.  Tallied up that's a 3.6 which generously rounds up to a 4."}
{"text":"Ok,  now do not judge.  Normally we do not going to chain restaurants, but we decided to try out the wings at Applebee's.  They have there wings for $.25 per wing after 11pm everyday.    So,  the wings were not all that bad for the price.  We ordered them hot and they came out a little spicy.  Also when you order the wings you have to buy 10 to get them at $.25 per wing.    Since we were at Applebee's the server was really good he did a great job taking care of us.    If you decided to go to Applebee's for a late night snack.  You should try out the wings."}
{"text":"I'm staring at my empty beer while hoping my server appears and brings me plates and silverware so I can eat my food that is getting cold"}
{"text":"Typical chain food.  Nothing special.  Wait staff seemed like they'd rather be elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the quality of food at this Applebee's Grill and Bar.  I do not recommend eating at this Applebee's. While my drinks were good, the food was horrible! My steak appeared old, and was tough to eat (did not eat it)! My mashed potatoes were cold, runny, and did not taste good at all.  The vegetables and my side salad were not appear fresh. Friends and family had been warned not to go to this restaurant to eat, but  because the Applebee's Grill in the state where I used to live was one of my favorite places to eat, I ignored their recommendations and went to this Applebee's anyway. At first, I was not going to tip the waitress, then I decided that she was not responsible for cooking my tough, old steak, runny mashed potatoes, and serving me old vegetables. She was efficient and friendly. Dinner for three was a total waste of money. However, the  location was great and the drinks were good, but the food was horrible!"}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends went here to eat and have a few drinks.  We ended up being seated, then waiting 20minutes for a server to approach our table.  She then blamed the wait on the restaurant not having cash change for one of tables that she had been looking for to give to another table.    She told us she would be right back, so we waited another 10-15minutes for our waters.  She finally comes back with our waters so we were ready to order by then.  We ordered 2 perfect margaritas.  Mind you we were sitting right in front of the bar, and literally watching the bartender just stand there for about 15 minutes before making our drinks.  While we were waiting for our food we seen the manager lick his fingers while helping out delivering orders.  When the food ends up coming out it came out cold and everything came out in the wrong order and all the servers looked like they hated each other and it was such a bad customer experience for us.    Would probably never come back."}
{"text":"Jen, the new server is absolutely the worst. She decided to take it upon herself to override our songs on the music playing device and laughed at our face. I've been coming here for 7 years and can't believe this from this amazing place."}
{"text":"Went to this place with family. ..warm welcomed....there was no waiting....server Trista helped us with coustemize my order because I am vegetarian. ....food was good...nice service. .."}
{"text":"First off, came for a friends birthday and had awesome service by Maria. We did have to wait, but it was a Thursday night. My party was very please with the games on t.v. as well. I ordered the new Chicken Bacon Beer entree. Presentation was great. Mashed potatoes and broccoli was awesome. However, be aware of the rich sauce that goes over the Chicken. I was also unsure if my chicken was cooked all the way through. The outside was good, but I just felt it could have been cooked further."}
{"text":"They make it obvious they do not like large groups of people. Not a place for the masses. Customer service is very selective and takes then a while to get the job done. Slowly phasing applebees out of my rotation of places to eat with friends.   The food here was pretty average but the poor customer service was enough to keep you away. I still ended up tipping 20%. Only coming here if nowhere else in town is open and my friends want food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am HUGEEEEEE on customer service!!! Being a local business owner I know that customers will always come first!  My family and I (2 adults, 2 kids) decided to go to applebees tonight. We walk in, NOBODY greets us!! We wait for a good 10 minutes before someone even decides to come and seat us. There was maybe 7 cars in the parking lot. Nobody was sitting at the bar...NOT EVEN THE BARTENDER, and on a scale of 1-10, id say it was a 3 as far as how busy they were. A waitress came to a table close to the door TWICE before she turned around and sat us at our table. She came back and dropped our silverware off and left again. Nobody took our drink order or anything! After 20 minutes of just sitting there. My family and I got up and left!!!! As we walked out. We walked past two employees that were just standing gossipping at the bar and 1 employee who was on her way to another table. My family and I are new to the Charotte area and we will NEVER go back to this establishment. Every employee on the shift of June 7th at 7:50PM needs to be FIRED!!!!! Point blank period. They were NOT busy at all and SEVERAL employees were literally just standing around gossipping. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I was greeted right away. Sat at the bar and the lady bartender Carmen also greeted me right away. She put my food order in quickly. I've been here a few times and always have gotten great service!"}
{"text":"The worst service tonight! These waiters and waitresses are all over the place! They are taking everyone's food to wrong tables, forgetting orders, bringing incorrect food and have the worst attitudes about it like it's the customers' fault. Our entire table is done with our food and my father still doesn't have an order of simple mild boneless wings. The table next to us got a completely different order! They have people standing in the middle of the restaurant holding trays wondering where they go. This was an absolutely horrible experience. I'm still sitting here just looking at them in disgust. And please don't order the Thai shrimp salad. It's disgusting! The shrimp taste slimy. I'm so pissed. I'm not normally a complainer like this so it must be really really bad for me to go off on a rant."}
{"text":"I come often for happy hour to get 1/2 off wings. Great service. My waitress Ellen M.  was very nice! I ordered boneless medium wings and fries. The food tasted good and came out fast. It is always cold in here though, so bring a jacket."}
{"text":"The bacon commercial with non stop fries, only says \"HEART ATTACK!!!!!\"   Thanks Applebee's"}
{"text":"We spent $60 on take out and only $20 worth of it was correct. It's bad enough that Applebee's is mediocre as it is, but I order buffalo and got barbecue, and no ranch on the side like I ordered. My bfs wings were also the wrong flavor. The quesadilla did not have any of the dipping sides with it. Just disappointing. But I guess I should have double checked my bag instead of assuming that what I ordered would be what I paid for. The two stars is simply because our entrees were correct."}
{"text":"I loved it!! I had a cute little brunch date with my boyfriend here and we did the 2 for $25 and it came with 1 appetizer to share and two entrees and it was a lot of food! Our waitress was incredibly nice and such a sweet woman. The food was good, and you get a lot for what you pay for. We had to take home half of our food because it was a lot but it was really good. I would want to go once a week."}
{"text":"NO 3-6 HAPPY HOUR DRINKS!!!!!!  Stopped in for their happy hour, first time at this location and the hostess told me no drinks during this happy hour only the later happy hour. Total waste, that isn't happy hour it's just half off select apps for a couple hours."}
{"text":"Shame   How can a menu with so many tasty options  Get three stars The elves in the back burned the ribs twice   But don't let that stop you  From swingin by for some delicious cocktails  Or one of the many yummy salads   Oh and if you get lemonade Then they cure young person cancer  So it's a win win   Ps: sweet potato fries were a nice way to rev the engine"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant today for lunch with my wife. There was one couple ahead of us for seating.  Then a party of 4 came in.  A gentleman that worked there came up  with a clipboard and took our names.  The place  was about half full.  The last four that came in told the guy they would take the table in the corner and he said \"go ahead and have a seat'.  He started to turn around as to leave and I said we will take the table just our right and again he said go ahead, leaving the first couple there to wait.  We sat down at the table and  waited for about 15 minutes and no one came up to take our drink order or anything else.  WE LEFT THE PLACE."}
{"text":"Brilliant ambiance, great servers and lip smacking foods. Can get a bit busy and loud in the evenings but a fantastic place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"On December 29, 2017, my sister called to inform the Applebee's Steelyard restaurant that we were coming for dinner and would have 13 in our party.  We were instructed to call an hour in advance which she did do.  When we arrived, there were no tables available for our 11 guests and we're asked to wait until an area was available. We said \"No problem\".   Very shortly after, we were asked if we wanted to sit in a large booth. We were able to get our party seated in the booth with one chair placed by the hostess (Brandy)  in the aisle.  However, our remaining 2 guests arrived late, pulled up 2 chairs to join us.  They did not order food, just drinks.  Another hostess very rudely came over to our area and said that were not allowed to put the additional chairs in the booth area as it was a \"fire hazard\".  When we tried to explain that we were seated there, she called the manager (Phil Lowe) to the table.  He spoke very rude to us as well.   A short time later, after dinner was served by our great waitress, Mariah,  the security guard (Sgt. Todd) approached our table and threatened our guests (with his hand on his pistol) with arrest if we didn't leave.  (He said to one of our guests, \"Would you like to spend the holiday in jail?\") We tried to explain the situation and they all refused to listen until my sister explained what had happened.   Then Sgt. Todd apologized saying that Brandy was \"just hired\".  By then, we were very upset because of the way we were treated.    We did leave but will never visit this Steelyard Applebee's again!!"}
{"text":"I show up at 11pm. They close at 1pm Monday-Wednesday. Nice crowd. I sit at the bar.  The wait staff are all attentive. I order the black and bleu burger. Delicious! Fries was cold tho... I can adapt.  The barista gave me a complimentary cookies and cream shake!  Nice!  My little heart was warmed... :-)"}
{"text":"This is an understatement. I work in the industry and communication is key even when you don't want to tell your customers there is a wait.... Patchy service from our bartender but it's applebees they're always understaffed so there's usually only a bartender at any location.  My friend and I played their trivia games to keep us entertained because apparently conversations from your bartender is forbidden. Two other people had their food before us and sat down after us. Each complained about their food.   An hour after we ordered still sitting there becoming hangry I asked the bartender to just refund our food and we'd pay for our drinks. She seemed very frazzled and I don't blame her.   The bartender and manager apologized but the manager wanted to argue with me about why there was a wait.... Apparently their computer systems were down and there's no such thing as paper tickets or communication with back of house. Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband & I went there for lunch to grab a bite to eat & ordered one of the 2/20 meals. One of the meals came with an appetizer. We ordered the mozzarellla sticks. They came in a basket & they were COLD. I ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad. He got the Chicken Bruschetta. We both oredered water to drink. Neither one of us got refills on our water, the service was lousy. We had to remind her all the time to get things for us. What really turned me off was I got DIRTY SILVERWARE. Our waitress NEVER EVER PICKED UP THE DIRTY SILVERWARE THAT I PUT ON THE TABLE NEXT TO US. She gave me new silverware & that didn't look much better then the last one I had but I tried to wipe if off on the napkin. Our food was okay but not worth the money that we paid for it. They do have some decent salads to choose from for a pretty good price. All you can eat salad & soups. They do need a better variety of soups though. The soups come out cold also & we have had to send them back 2-3 times each time we got more soup. I would not really recommend this restaurant unless you aren't in a hurry & can stand to wait about a half an hour for your food to arrive cold."}
{"text":"So, I ate there on Wednesday and it is now Friday.  I have not had solid food or been able to keep anything down since I went there.  In an area that has so many great places don't go there.  Keep driving east on Camelback and hit one of the many other restaurants on that street."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Are here trice this week. Tonight server was Rob aka Robbie very nice your man.   Courteous, good personality and attentive.   I love their wonton chicken tacos even when they are not on special.     Clean location, good food and happy servers.    Steak dinners on Sunday and breakfast burger tonight.   Can always count on them for good food."}
{"text":"This is the Best Applebee's location in the valley. Exceptional service and leadership and great cooks.   The Asian chicken salad is always a go to favorite but tonight we each started with the featured drink - Bahama Mama for $3.50 and the All in burger with seasoned fries which I request extra crispy.  The burger is a hand pressed patty with the onion and bacon inside.  It was awesome, great taste, fresh and the cheese was not overpowering.    Our server Nicole was lovely, she was friendly, attentive and managed her section with precision.  Ask for Nicole' section.  Applebee's are set up similar in all locations.   This location had a mixed clientele young couples and families to seniors.   Large dining area with table and booths, along with a large \"U\" bar with hightops and TV w/ sports.  The managers Ralph and Benjamin do a good job assisting servers when it gets crowded and talking to their guests.   They seem supportive of their staff, always nice to see.    Your must try their wonton chicken tacos, these are an app, but add a small salad and you have a meal.   This location happy hours twice a day with half price apps and drinks.   Great selection of deserts too, but we never seem to get them but they look great and come in two sizes regular and small for smaller appetites.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. We had a great lunch. Its not that busy for lunch time. I think there was only one server but she did good. The food took longer than usual. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"First time going into Applebee's, satisfaction was met. My date and I where seated upon arrival. The environment was calm. We did feel a bit rushed from the waitress to order as well as finish our meals."}
{"text":"Typically we have some bad service at this location but this time around it wasn't bad at all. We had the Chicken Tacos from their happy hour menu and really enjoyed them! Well worth it for Happy hour.   I enjoy the tablet option they now have. We using have Applebee's late night so it's fun to get some games or entertainment going at the table especially with the kids.   I wish this location had more consistency with their service. I have had visits where I have waited 10 mins or more for a refill then I have visits like this one. I give it 3 starts for its inconsistency and honestly the food quality just isn't there it is Applebee's so I don't expect the best but I know that there is no care in putting these meals together."}
{"text":"This was the first time ever at this location. I have to say, I was very surprised with it, and in a good way. Service was really great. From the moment we all walked in , we were greeted by a friendly staff. the hostess held the door open for us and greeted us. We had a great server who suggested some items to our party. the girls I was with said they really liked what they got here.  I go the Chicken grilled Ceaser Salad. I was really surprised again how good it was It was late afternoon. Another great thing about them, you can order the whole menu. They do not shut down lunch to reopen for dinner. It was a spur of the moment decision to go here so I was not excepting great at all. I as well as the others I came in with for lunch also thought it was a very nice meal and great service. Lots of parking in the lot as well."}
{"text":"It's Applebees, nothing overly special about the sodium laced meals.  Usually a short wait in the evening, probably not worth it.  Sadly though, there's not much better in Surprise that has the same type of food that isn't a chain.  Parking in this lot is a PITA as it is adjacent to WallMart and is a generally poorly designed parking lot.  Mix that in with the snow birds and wallmartians ... you get the drift."}
{"text":"Excellent service, we got here early and they served us coffee to wake up! Great food, first time here and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Seriously asked for my steak done to medium and always get a well done steak.  I asked this time to give me medium and again get a well done steak.  I let my server know and he said ok I'll take care of it.  Then 15 minutes later asked for my plate with my un-eaten steak.  Then 10 minutes later In I get my steak after party have completed their meals.  Then I'm told by the manager on duty that the meat is cut thicker than others.  Does mean I'm supposed to know how the meat is cut and tell them how to cook it on any given day?...wtf!!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible!!! They are always short staffed on waiters so they sit you down and take forever to take your order. Me and my bf went to this location because we were in the area and they sat us down in the first 5 minutes and thus was around 3 pm and we literally had to hunt someone down to just take our drink order we literally sat for 20 minutes with no service and walked right out"}
{"text":"We stopped by last Friday around 4pm. Terrible customer service. We ordered drinks we usually spend a few hours there drinking and having different types of food to try out. The place was only serving like 3 other tables. But I'm assuming they just don't want any type of business the manager was standing in a table in the back not caring about what customers needed or anything in particular. The person taking care of us was rude and he has no idea what happy hour means. He brought our drinks and the appetizers with the appetizers he also brought us the ticket to pretty much go ahead and pay Lol we tried to order more drinks but he seemed to be in the worst mood ever....... we ended up leaving. This is the third time that this happened to us. Stay away. Find a better place."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. My family and I were greeted quickly upon our arrival. They offer happy hour even in the dining room area and not just the bar area. That's pretty much it for the good. Now- half our food order and beverages weren't the best. My two son's ordered frozen lemonades. We used to love them here. Now they are like shaved ice with little flavor and hard to drink through straws. One of my son's sent his back and opted for a raspberry iced tea instead. My husbands chicken penne pasta was beyond watered down. Not impressed. Sad that the cook thought it was presentable to send to a table. Safe to say it will be my first and last time eating food here."}
{"text":"This is a really great place  The music was pretty loud when we showed up around 9:45 pm but other than that Aaron our server was awesome. The guy with the tattoos lol. Super cool  Great business will be returning"}
{"text":"Yes, five stars. Our friendly server, the flavor, portion size, nutritional value of our food, the great service from Ashley. I dont give 5 stars to chain restaurants, name brand eateries like Spago, Fiery & the like, just because their name is on it. It has to BE 5 stars. For management: please provide tasting sessions for your servers.  Other than being a benefit to your bottom line, it is a valuable customer service tool."}
{"text":"Can I leave negative stars?? I had to meet someone for business on a weekday, for lunch, and this was the place suggested by that person.  Years ago when I lived on the west coast of Florida, my boyfriend and I would habitually stop at Applebee's on the way home from the beach- it was a comfy spot, great food, perfect drinks and  specials- great staff. Soon thereafter I became aware that the chain was trying to become more \"family friendly\"; meaning, I guess, that if you'd like to have a later dinner, between 7-10 PM- the bright lights were on (think \"I-hop\"-ish). No thanks. If I want to sit at a bar with a pal, have a snack at 9PM, I sure as hell don't wanna feel like it's lunch hour at the diner.  I phased them out.  If you've read any of my other bar/restaurant reviews, you'll know for sure that I have serious issues with cleanliness and health code violations.  Fast forward to this visit to Applebee's  27th/Bell. Holy crap.  Not sure if they're still doing that \"brightly daylight on the inside\" thing- it was kind of 'dimm-ish' light - AND with that lighting, you could see the dust, fingerprints, smudges general dirtiness of the place. We were seated by the doorway at a \"high-top\" table, given menus that SCREAMED bacteria- I couldn't bring myself to look through- and just ordered french fries.  The thing about meeting someone for business is: you really can't say - \"this place is disgusting, can we go someplace else?\". He actually ordered a couple menu items, I have no idea if he was ill afterward-even the serving plates were gross- (french fries come on paper in a basket). I only ordered a glass of water but no freaking way I was going to have even a sip of it when I saw the 'floaters' between the bottom of the inside of the glass & the ice -- which, never settled and stayed in a sort of suspended motion for my whole visit.  Would have loved to take a pic of that to post, but really couldn't do so during this particular meeting.  I did, however, take about 10-11 pictures inside of the ladies room- keep in mind; #1: it was 1:30 in the afternoon-not last call, #2: the employees use this restroom as well as patrons.  If the lighting is bright in the restroom(as it should be that time of day-and it was) and the photos show how gross it is, just think of how disgusting the kitchen and bar areas are.  LADIES ROOM- here goes:(see photos) Divider between stalls have splashes of God knows what...the mildew/mold/debris around the toilets, floor drain and floor tile, tile on the lower walls and the sink- quite interestingly, a fork lies atop a very dusty paper towel dispenser -- and I still can't wrap my head around what's going on inside the soap dispenser.  Applebee's: if this is a franchise, please clean up your act!! But I digress; do whatever you want, as I will never be back and will for sure dissuade anyone else from going there.  ***I try to leave a good review for every bad review I write, but I may be a little behind in the good ones***"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer restorants. Great food. Really Injoyed being. Very nice and clean. Friendly."}
{"text":"We came in for appetizers and a beer service was okay could of been better spinach dip was too blend missing some flavor but sweet potato fries were really good and the angry orchard was cold . Overall was okay for  appetizers and beers."}
{"text":"i just found out about a website that gives results of all restaurant inspections in cuyahoga county= cuy. cty. board of health. i've eaten here in the past but never again.  this applebees is dirty!  they had 4-5 critical violations which equals a \"d\" rating. do not eat here.  lyndhurst location is clean with an \"a\"."}
{"text":"Or server was Tamrah B. She was very nice and patient with our 3 year old ordering. The only complaint is the wait. It took 30 min to get our appatizer and another 20 min to get our meal."}
{"text":"Applebees food while it isn't the greatest, it is what you expect.  So I went there with the expectation to have some pretty good food and a pretty good price and I wasn't mistaken.  Food and price were what I expected and was worth it.  The problem was the service.  I walked in and the host was talking to the manager about something not work related.  The host said hi, and then went back to talking.  After a few more seconds and after the manager looked at me and looked away, the host decided to ask if I'd like a table.  I said yes and that there would be one more joining me, so he took me to a table.  The server took about 6-7 minutes to come and greet me and I ordered my drink.  My friend came a few minutes later and I still hadn't gotten my root beer I ordered.  After a few more minutes, the server came back and asked for her drink order and she ordered a pepsi.  I still didn't have my root beer.  After about 10 minutes he comes back with both drinks and we order.  Food comes out fine and it tastes like what we expected but the server is no where in sight.  So in the hour we were there, we interacted with the server 4 times.  We both drank our drinks and needed refills and each time another server who happened to be walking by refilled them.  The reason I gave them two stars is because the food is the only thing that saved them from getting a one star review for their service."}
{"text":"Happy hour at this Applebee's is like snow bird central.  There's always a line out the door, a long wait, and the dozens of grandparents who occupy it seem to be there e.v.e.r.y.d.a.y... However! We LOVE it! The specials are great (best on our side of town actually) and we get a seat at the bar almost every time regardless how crowded it is.  The 2 regular bartenders Chance and (blonde dude, can't remember his name but he's cool too) are always very nice,fast, and make awesome drinks. We come here almost every week, and it never disappoints! 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"We went early today to avoid any possible rush. Greeted nicely and seated right away. Immediate service with drinks being brought straight away. At this point my mate says; dark in here. The wait person came to take our order. Tonight we had Cory as our server, a very upbeat helpful person providing good service. We order our dinners plus soup. We both liked our soup, I enjoyed my main plate of ribs, my mate did not like his thinking; where is the Cajun in the steak. The steak it self was tender and cooked as requested. Just no discernable flavour. Even though I enjoyed my food I have a feeling we will not be going back. In the middle of the meal they turn down the lights and turn up the music. The music was just fine, why try to drown out conversation? I also might suggest that someone, everyone clean the front door where people put there fingers, it is grimy from long periods of not being cleaned. Also much closer to the diner is the shades on the windows they are absolutely disgusting with grime. I doubt they have ever been cleaned."}
{"text":"Boo! My 2 most recent visits were bad and worse. Slow service. Slow. And they were not even busy. The wrong food was brought out to my friend and the group food was not all brought together, like my fries came out 10 mins before everything else. The server Marc was slow and doesnt come back with water refills until u say something several times. No thanks. Goodbye Applebees."}
{"text":"Went here today for the 2 for $20.  Husband and I ordered the 6 oz sirloin with a baked potato.   He wanted fries as his 2nd side and I ordered broccoli.   The meals came and they were identical both with baked potato and fries.  Took a long time but my side of broccoli arrived right after I discovered a hair entwined in my sour cream on the potato.   I was really hungry when we arrived,  now I'm feeling like puking.  The manager came and offered something else so I ordered fiesta lime chicken.  This came as we were ready to go so got it to go.  The fries were dried out, the broccoli was imploded with salt, I squeezed the lime and nothing came out.  Our waitress was very slow.  They deducted $10 from our meal but I did not feel any genuine concern.  We will try a different Applebees another time but we will never visit this one again."}
{"text":"I didn't eat at the restaurant, we did the carside to go instead. The order process was good and the server that took my order was very efficient. The food came out hot and straight to my car which was super convenient. The whole Carside to go option is fabulous."}
{"text":"Ren made my experience amazing. TWICE! She's truly what great customer service is and I am pleased to say I will be coming back every Monday to see her."}
{"text":"15 minutes this time around. Actually called from 3 different phones at the same time. All 3 we're put on hold! Still nobody returned to take our order. Just passed the place and the parking lot is empty?! I don't get it. Taco Bell again. Which has great service by the way!"}
{"text":"On this cold day the restaurant was nice and warm when we walked inside.  The waitress was very friendly and nice.  Haley was very outgoing and full of energy, I was very happy to have her as our waitress.  Our drinks were brought to us quickly.  The food was very good.  The Thai shrimp salad had plenty of shrimp and the bourbon chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"I don't come to Applebee's on Peoria and 59th very often.  Their slow and by the time you get the food it's cold.  I've gone to the one on camelback and central and my food is hot.  I got a Bodie to share with my daughter on Camelback and it came out sizzling I get it here on Peoria and the only thing even slightly warm is the plate.  My chicken wings were cold.  The service is terrible.  I saw 8 tables empty but we stood 10 mins to wait for a table.  Come on Applebee's get it together.  Your service is awful.  Our waitress should have been the housekeeper because that is what she did the whole time instead of taking care of us.  Finally had to call another waitress over."}
{"text":"I only really come here for drinks, but the staff is always stellar. My friends and I especially enjoy Jimmy. He's an awesome dude."}
{"text":"I think this might be the best Applebee's in town. I have bad customer service problems at others in town but this one always seems to have great staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst customer service ever for the restaurant that I have ordered full rack  of ribs! They was cold when they arrive at my table"}
{"text":"The boyfriend inexplicably received an Applebee's gift card from one his aunts that takes too many pictures and never throws anything away.  Those last details were entirely beside the point.  He never expressed any out of the ordinary interest in this famous chain, but nonetheless we were left with a 25 dollar gift card and no choice but to man the crowded booths of our local Applebee's.   It's odd when you never go to chain restaurants how much you notice the differences between them and other places we normally eat.  We went on a Wednesday night and there were people waiting for a table.  Two million restaurants in Phoenix and these assholes are WAITING for mediocre chain food.  There were only two of us so we were seated promptly at a two top near the kitchen and instantly were mesmerized by the completely muddled,  incoherent memorabilia that lines the walls of this place.  A photo of Marilyn Monroe, next to a Route 66 sign, next to a football helmet, next to a baseball hat, next to a picture of Johnny Carson with a cigar or someshit.  Perhaps it is difficult, or rather simply unnecessary, to provide your restaurant with an easily deciphered theme.     Not that anyone who is eating at Applebee's gives a fuck.   Another thing I noticed about the ambiance is that this is certainly a watering hole for those afflicted with that whole \"obesity epidemic\" thing here in America.  And I'm not being a bitch, man, there were just a lot of fat people there.  Our server, an over weight Latino man with a raspy voice and  purposeful speed takes our drink orders right away.  We both get Long Islands which are served in an obscenely sized goblet straight out of the 18th century.  I am small and I don't work out and I hate when drinks are fucking so heavy that I have to use two hands.  I understand that it is now a trademark of these types of restaurants to make their drinks large, colorful and spectacular- but I can't help but pretentiously think as I lift the four pound concoction of watered down syrup and ice, \"this is just fucking retarded.\"  We order a few appetizers; the spicy bone-in wings and mozzarella sticks.  The wings are dinky and under salted but not disgusting.  The mozzarella sticks were... mozzarella sticks.  You can't really go wrong or right with fried cheese but they got cold fast and the cheese hardened.    The redeeming quality of our Applebee's outing was our likable and attentive server.  While we never really make our way to chain restaurants (as there is just so much other good shit Phoenix has to offer), it was sort of nice to have a friendly and non-hipster server.  A guy not concerned with spouting off specials and showing us the wine list and judging us if we order domestic instead of premium,  just a giant Mexican dude probably with a family of four at home trying to make some good tips.  And I guess that's always the nice, homey thing about chain places; it's all just so average and normal and sometimes that feels like comfort.   I can't honestly say that I'll return to Applebee's anytime soon unless we come across another gift card from another relative that takes too many pictures and doesn't throw anything away, but I can say that it was an overall interesting experience to be out of our comfort zone, talking and watching the hoards of middle Americans order their steak and shrimp or chicken fried steak and shovel it in their mouth while they talk about how the fuck they're going to pay the mortgage this month.  Maybe our server can pay HIS with the giant tip we left him."}
{"text":"Never been here during the day, but I LOVE going here on weeknights when I can, best on Thursdays so far, but they always have great specials everyday of the week and something going on each night. The staff is friendly and funny, and I've seen some regulars (we sit at the bar lol) and they are so nice too.  I am loving that I live so close to this one, and the food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. ~So is the alcohol! Except it's cold, fresh, and delicious.~ AND, it not packed, so you actually can here your conversations and have a great time. If you're close, check it out :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Applebee's in years and years. Seriously, I usually eat locally. But I was in Phoenix with a friend and honestly didn't have the time or inclination to go to a local Phoenix establishment, especially when I was starving and ready to head back to Tucson.  So, Applebee's it was. And it was great! For two people the bill was about $36 and this include two meals for about $12 year, including my big bowl of spicy shrimp pasta. It came with some bread, and a big plate of onion rings and a delicious sauce- tasted like Jack Daniel's sauce. We finished it off with the little .99 cent brownie bites with ice cream- since I could barely move and was so full with delicious goodness it was a perfect size to finish off with.   Service was outstanding, ice tea refilled on a constant basis. Very very good!"}
{"text":"Service is good, food is decent and it's all you can expect from an Applebee's...  Ordered a margarita and it took 15 min to get there. Server apologized twice but regardless, the restaurant was empty.  Grilled jalape√±o line shrimp was ok but nothing great, lacks a little bit of flavor.  In general, restaurant is decent, there are better options out there."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening to a 30 minute or so wait. We were seated in a nice spot on the north side, the loudest area is definitely the bar. The wait for our food wasn't bad at all. Our waiter was certainly nice and made pleasant conversation and checked in on us occasionally as supposed. Our food was mediocre at best, my sirloin was tougher than I expected and wanted. My dates food was bland and we were eager to leave and get dessert elsewhere. If it's not much farther, I'd recommend the one in Tempe, or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 2 times now and both times the service as well as the food have been amazing. First time I came with some family from out of town. Total of 5 of us. I wish I remembered the waiters name because this guy was great. Soft spoken, Hispanic gentlemen. He remembered all of our drink orders (no 2 drinks were the same), and all of our food orders (all different orders with a few slight variations) without once writing it down or even repeating it out loud. The food and time it takes to get to the table is very quick. I did not however like how I offered a pasta dish and it seemed rather small. I left slightly hungry that day. Second time I ordered a steak and it was perfect. My girlfriend had gotten the Cowboy burger each time and loves it. She loves Red Robin and the burgers there, but said that the burger she gets here is way better.  Definitely will be coming here again. Just a short 10 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"Have been craving fish and chips for a while so i had that with a mango lemonade and it hit the spot :) our server paul was super nice but i feel bad for giving him a tip in coins but i gave him 5 dollars in quarters (im a waitress too so that was my collective tips) overal yummy place"}
{"text":"Applebee-ware... come here for great deals!  They always seem to have fantastic deals and thats mainly the reason why my husband and I continue to come here.  Where else can you get 2 entree's and an appetizer for 20 bucks?! Especially when I order the spicy shrimp pasta and he ordered the ribs and fries. The app we decided would be the spinach artichoke dip. Overall the food is mediocre. Nothing special. Whenever we come here we notice that the food lacks some flavor. Bland? you could say so. Its good enough to eat, but not good enough to where I want to stuff myself or lick my plate or fingers.  The service is nice and friendly but never over the top. They smile, they're always taking plates or refilling drinks but its never the type of service that makes you want to come back, just cause the service is amazing. OR i've never left, being able to remember his or her name, saying wow they did spectacular.   I'm always impressed with their changing menu. I like that they have dishes that are for everyone. A couple for the weight watchers group (yes, that includes my grandma), the low carb dieters (me, once in a while) or the over the top carb lovers (my hubs digs those dishes)."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday for appetizers and drinks and wow was it a disappointment. The service was horrid and I will not be returning.   It took forever to be seated, without even being greeted, the hostess just stood their texting on her phone.   Next, it took 15 mins just to get our drinks.   And another 35 to get appetizers, ridiculous, my daughter was with us and she was not having it. Those with kids know what I'm talking about. 35 mins seems like an hour to them and when they're hungry, they are hungry. Someone has released the cracken.   What probably ticked me off the most was when I asked for the bone in wings. She said they didn't have them. I said okay well then instead I will have the spinach dip. She then tried five times to convince me to get boneless wings. First time I said no I don't like them, then second I said it's okay thanks I'd rather go with the dip. After the third and continuously pushy way she tried to get me I ignored her and just stood forward looking at my husband to stop myself from being rude. I want bone in not boneless... Period. Yes I'm picky but I'm buying what I like and want,   It then lastly took another 35 mins to get the bill, which by then I practically threw at her so I could leave and get my daughter to bed. All in all bad bad experience."}
{"text":"Applebee's will always be my go to place when I don't feel like cooking. Good food ok service weather it's to go or I sit down inside. I have had good and bad service there over the years but hey that happens."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday because I heard they were doing AYCE crosscut ribs to promote the new menu item. The ribs could be ordered as a single order for $11.99 or AYCE for $13.99 so it's a no brainer which one I picked. Before showing up I was a little unsure what crosscut ribs were exactly...apparently they are a rack of ribs that have been sliced...which means the bones are flat shaped. There are 3 different sauces to choose from: Asian sweet chili, smokey chipotle and honey BBQ. They all sounded good so I was sure to try all 3 of them. The orders come with a full order of fries each time although the amount of ribs you get is less each time. The ribs were a lot more tender than I had imagined and they're definitely not as dry and chewy as rib tips or riblets at most other places.  Service was mediocre, mainly because I was seated at a table in the bar area so the lone bartender had to run around serving everyone. It took a while to get the server's attention each time but when I finally did, my refills and food orders came out pretty quickly. The manager saw that I was having the new ribs and stopped by to chat and see how I liked them  The restaurant overall was fairly clean and quiet, which is different than locations I've gone to in other cities. This was probably my first lunch at this location in over a year but I seem to remember that service was more efficient the last time I had a weekday lunch here."}
{"text":"My faith in Applebees has been restored thanks to my experience tonight. Mike is a fantastic server, both attentive and kind. The recent additions to the menu are inspired and unexpectedly delicious.  Before we dive into details, let me say that I am giving 4 stars understanding that I came here on a Thursday at 1 AM. My fiance and I were one of 2 couples eating. Most of the negative reviews I see here come from busy lunch/dinner shifts. I will need a second incredible experience before I will be willing to give this restaurant five stars. However, I definitely had a five star night out.   So the last time I went to Applebees was late last year, at the one on Bell and the 17, and that whole meal was just awful. I had a disgustingly greasy quesadilla burger and my fiance had the blandest mac n cheese ever. It was a Sunday during a football game, and our server seemed more interested in watching the game than paying any attention to her customers. That day we made a promise: NEVER AGAIN.  I now have a night-shift tech job, and my fiance is in college, so we've become nocturnal. This really limits our options when we get hungry for dinner after midnight. Tonight, we were on our way to maybe find something to eat/drink around Metrocenter, but we saw the Applebees on the way and thought, why not? Let's give it a shot.  Within minutes of arriving, Mike had us enjoying small talk and drinks. My fiance had a martini made exactly to their specifications (which MANY restaurants fail to do) and I had a Sam Adams.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip. Most places put too much cheese in this appetizer, but this time the vegetables really got a chance to speak.  I had the Brew Pub Philly, a new sandwich on the menu, and sweet potato fries. I was skeptical about spending twelve dollars on a sandwich, but I gladly would again. The steak was tender. The cheese was gooey and tasty, and the whole sandwich had just the right amount of spicy.   My fiance had the mushroom swiss burger, which is something they normally get at other restaurants. The burger was perfect. It was so juicy. They asked for it pink, and it wasn't too pink. The vegetables were great, but the sauce really took it over the edge, making it one of the best burgers they had ever had.   Also, my fiance wasn't sure if they wanted fries or onion rings. They expressed this to Mike, but decided on onion rings. Mike later came out saying that the cook burned the onion rings, so he brought them some fries while another batch of onion rings was cooked. So we still ended up with both! It was either a happy accident or some outstanding customer service from Mike.  We ended up boxing up half of our meals so that we could have some dessert: churro smores. I know what you're saying: What?! We said the same thing. But it was so good. I even ended up with some chocolate sauce on my shirt.   The whole time we were eating, Mike was always there to offer an extra napkin or refill our waters. He even gave us to-go waters when we left. As my people say, he was a real mensch. He mentioned that he just recently started working at Applebees. He's the main reason why we're coming back."}
{"text":"Went to Applebee's with my boyfriend and the kitchen was very late in giving us our food. Also, they did not have much beer. To end it, the waitress took his card and without asking, swiped it on the machine at the table and gave herself a huge tip.  So i suggest you all make sure you look at your receipt. My boyfriend was angry and stated we will not be back to that one.   He said she obviously needed it more than he did."}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service means,Poor Management! Waited a long time for the greeter or host with no personality.Staff's glanced but didn't acknowledged us.Our waitress was alright but needs a little improvement.Maybe because she was too busy with the other customers too,that she can't really attend to our needs.  Luckily,we enjoyed our food.  Suggestion: Customer Service Training!"}
{"text":"The waitresses were very nice, we came in a big group. they got our food out very quick but my whole class got food poisoning here."}
{"text":"Should have known when on a Friday night there were very few cars that meal would be subpar.  Steak with shrimp on top was good but had 2 shrimp on top. Had to pay 1.99 extra for a potato which we asked to use my husbands 2nd side as. Instead we were brought 2 baked potatoes that were so cold the butter did not melt and were charged a total of $4 extra.  Sons burger was fine, husbands ribs were good also.  Would not recommend or go back"}
{"text":"Our server Rissi doesnt seem like shes ever been a server before, pretty much waited 15 minutes to be greeted, another 15 for our drinks to come . Just slow server. Being one myself,theirs plenty she could do to show she is working for her tips. Slop job ."}
{"text":"Great food great service Erica was excellent made great drinks and they took the AARP.card  ya yummy"}
{"text":"server loudly ridiculed us when we told her we weren't drinking alcohol at 4 in the afternoon.  also left after only taking half our orders. Had to send my burger back, at that point i figured I just wouldn't eat or that the kitchen staff had messed with it. I gave her money for the bill and she shorted us on change. The only reason I didn't call the manager over to get it back was because I just wanted the hell out of there.  Servers name was Ashley B., and she ruined my life."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here three times so far.  Mainly up here to buy a car, for a free oil/filter change and a recall on the same car.  Would come here to eat.  Every time the food and the service has been excellent."}
{"text":"What happened to Applebee's?  Stopped there this evening to have dinner and ordered their combined appetizers platter.  The menu made it look like a good deal but the food came out....  there was very little food and the quality of the food looked horrible.  Didn't want to eat it.  Sent it back and left.  Felt bad for the waitress and left her a tip... it wasn't her fault.  We are well aware that Applebee's is not fine dining.  But it was always good food at a fair price.  Not tonight.  Did Applebee's standards dip that far?  Horribly disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last evening.and ordered Margaritas.  We had the Clubhouse Grill sandwich, Oriental chicken salad and Bourbon street steak and a brownie with ice cream for dessert.  The food and drinks were excellent and so was the bartender's service and demeanor.  Well run joint!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Applebee's in forever. I had my car taken for an oil change and had an hour to kill and get lunch. My waitress was very polite. Super nice! The food came fast and to my great surprise my quesadilla burger tasted fresh. The fries did look very white and tired. They looked sort of dead. But after I poured a bunch of ketchup on them - life was good. My hour passed by fast... listening to disco music and realizing I haven't missed that much at Applebee's."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Shocked to read the reviews, my visits are great. Well I guess you can't really mess up wings & drinks."}
{"text":"This is my first time being at an Applebee's ever in life. The starts aren't so much for the food because I cleaned my plate no problem, but more so for the service.   I came here for lunch with my friend and we did the 2 for 20. The waitresses seems way uninterested in our table. I finished eating and sat there for about 15 mins. They weren't concerned with us after the food was on the table, not once asking how we were or if we needed anything. I could possibly understand if the place was super busy but it wasn't.  Maybe next time I'll try the Applebee's near my house and have a better experience. :/"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pretty reasonable priced date night, Applebee's would be one of my recommendations. Their food pricing is very cheap, they have the 2 for $20 meals which includes 2 main dish entrees and 1 appetizer you can share. This is typically good for two people.   We came here on a Monday night which was $6.99 for ALL burgers and unlimited fries! Quality wise, I wouldn't say it's the very best, but it wasn't the worst neither. I love that they have blue moon on tap! I'm a big blue moon fan, and anywhere who sells blue moon on tap automatically catches my attention.   Anyways, ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. (Oh!!! They also have happy hour which is from 4-9p and its half off all appetizers) and got 2 burgers. One was the western burger and the other was probably their basic American burger (I can't remember the name). This is a good date night place during the weekday. Very casual, very chill."}
{"text":"Not 2 stars for the location... just in Applebee's the corporation. Family and I use to go in at least once a week because they had a awesome happy hour for apps and beer, now there happy hour menu has like 4 items and they are not very good."}
{"text":"This is the third time we've ordered take-out from Applebee's and the entire order was incomplete. This location did it today and the other two times were at the Power Rd./Ray Rd. location. That said, each time, the Manager's have been kind to put my name on the Manager's Log for a meal replacement towards future orders. We continue to give Applebee's a chance because their food is good and their prices are good. Plus, they have the salad that I am obsessed with, the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad with jalapeno dressing! That said, the food quality does seem to be decreasing. So, with everything is consideration, we may be ending our loyalty to Applebee's in Mesa and Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is one of the few location of Applebees that my boyfriend and I go to. For one, it's Applebees. Nothing too fancy just a casual restaurant to go with a friend or even to have happy hour at.  They have a happy hour menu for drinks by the bar and at some tables.  I also go for the 2 for $20. It's always good and very filling. The staff here is always nice and very polite. If anyone ever goes here on a friday night then ask for the station that Esmi is working at. She is our regular server. She's been in the industry for quite some time.   For those that likes to expect a lot more than just bar food, get out! It's just a casual place to have brunch with your friends or even family and to talk and have fun. Don't expect this place to be a 5 star fine restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst experience at an Applebee's that I have ever had in my life! First ordered to go waited curbside for 10min then had to go inside myself to pick up! I got green beans instead of the broccoli I ordered, my steak I ordered med rare it was well done and the extra side I ordered of the Mac n cheese was cold and stiff as heck!!!  I only got through 2 bites of my food when there was a strand of short hair in my mashed potatoes!!! Sooo disappointed and still hungry!!! Tried to call back and was put on hold for over 5minutes just waiting to speak to a manager...after waiting on hold I finally had enough and gave up!!!! I will never be back again!!"}
{"text":"Took 25 mins for the manager to take our names to seat three of us,another 15mins to be seated,been sitting for 20mins now no server came to take drink orders,we have decided to just leave too hungry to sit & watch other customers enjoy their meal without so much as some water to sip on."}
{"text":"Easy online ordering using 'carside to go', ...ordered the 'Blazin' Texan' burger...it was cooked perfectly and ready on time as promised..and it's really good!"}
{"text":"Just sat at Applebee's for almost an hour, never even got my side salad, watching people at three tables seated long after me happily enjoying their appetizers. I sat there patiently sipping on the one single beer that the waiter brought me, who totally ignored me after that. When I said I was leaving, he said he would bring me my check. Spoke with the manager and she apologized and comped the beer. Small price for totally wasting an hour of my life, and I'm starving now. I'm in the area for business, and I would never purposely choose Applebee's, but there is literally nothing else around here. Back to the hotel for the same limited menu I've dealt with all week. Joy! Ugh."}
{"text":"I gave one star because that is the lowest amount of stars you can give. This restaurant does not realize that there are too many restaurants in the immediate area for both the food and service to be subpar. The restaurant was fairly empty (approximately 7 occupied tables), however, the server was not attentive and slow to serve. She barely came to the table to check on us. She never once refilled our waters. And, she never cleared the table of the appetizer plates; we were eating our entrees and she never came back to clear the table of those plates. It was a crowded mess. Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, \"well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones.\" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, \"thanks for the feedback,\" then he left. The food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste. Needless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to come her quite weekly. It was insane. And then slowly but surely service and rudeness stopped me from coming. Decided to order online yesterday because I was sick. My husband went to pick it up at car-side-to-go. He waited for twenty mins outside before being told by Applebee's staff and going to the wrong area but to go to the bartender. The bartender working yesterday at 2/11/18 at around 1:30 is rude as hell! She messed up our order. I ordered a classic combo and I usually get a full four quesadillas to which I only got two! She didn't put in the ranch dressing until after my husband asked if she did then rudely yelled \"I took care of it!\" She not to mention forgot my sons chocolate milk and made the kid sized drink a coke when I ordered a regular coke to go. They forgot his yogurt and strawberries and my food was cold. Because my husband had to wait almost a half an hour! Let's not forget the rude bartender. People Don't go to this one! It's horrible!"}
{"text":"Alright.. i went to this restaurant with my friends and they took a very very long time to get our order. Finally we got a food after long wait and guess what... food is worst. This was my first applebees where the food tasted very very worst.. and couple of my friends just left the food on the table after tasting the food. Not expecting this from applebees at all..."}
{"text":"Went there recently,  have not been to one in AZ.  Was mildly surprised by it not being very good.  We frequented Applebees a lot in CO. because it was close to work.  I ordered a chinese chicken salad and it was about a saucer full for nearly 10 dollars. My husband had soup and sandwich. All you can eat soup came in cup size bowl and sandwich was 1/2,  for 8 dollars.   Where is the value in that?  The waitress was very SLOW to arrive but after that was attentive and very friendly.  We both walked out still hungry after an over $20.00 check.   Wont be going back to Applebees.  Would have had a much better lunch at Cheesecake Factory for about the same price."}
{"text":"RT if you are surprised this restaurant chain is still in business. I only came here because I've been binge watching Friday Night Lights. The food was whatever but at least they had WiFi. A nearby table was celebrating a birthday and the staff seemed really insincere when they showed up to sing. It was heartbreaking. If you are going to waste your time with a subpar restaurant chain maybe you should consider taking a trip to Olive Garden because even if it sucks at least you're family."}
{"text":"OH WOW!! THIS WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE AND INSULTING EXPERIENCE!!!!  I chose this location to have a family lunch to send off my daughter back to school. I was sooo excited for the all you can eat riblets. I'm not even going to talk about horrible our server was, his name was Christopher.  The manager had to fill out refills because Christopher was nowhere to be seen, and this is a small store. It took 25 min to get our food,  they did bring us chips and salsa. But there were no plates and napkins. My God I'm ranting!! I ordered the ribs naked with sauce on the side and they arrived fully sauced. I explained that they were supposed to be naked and sauce in side. My family ate all of their food and I still didn't get my plate. After 40 min. a kid showed up, but come on, no thank you send them back. The manager didn't even come by to speak to us. Christopher wasn't even aware I sent the food back when I asked him to remove the item from my bill. I told him that this was a horrible experience, he shrugged it off. Server came back and informed me that the manager removed the ribs from the bill. But no manager came to visit the table, guy sucks at his job. But, I was given a to go box with 4 ribs,  How Effin insulting,  I went in for all you can eat, and their solution was to give me a box of cold ribs.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH APPLEBEES!!! NO STARS!!!! I spent $70 and didn't eat."}
{"text":"Horrible... I ordered car side to go because I was in a hurry and thought it would be a good way to save time. I placed my order with a server who didn't know anything about the menu or lunch specials. I was told my order would be ready at 1:30 and asked what type of vehicle I drive. Pulled up in the car side spot around 1:40 and continued to sit in my car and wait another 8 minutes. Finally walked in the side door to a server who was standing there talking on the phone. He acknowledged me while still on the phone and I told him I was picking up an order to go. He looked at a few tickets and didn't bother to check the bag that was sitting right in front of him, said it would be a few minutes and then moved to another station to get on a personal phone call. Waiting another couple of minutes another server came out bringing drinks and asked what I needed. Finally he was able to get me my food that was sitting at the station the whole time. I let him know I was out there waiting 10 minutes and that there was another car there waiting too. This is just ridiculous whats the point of car side. I may be able to understand if it was busy but the place was dead and servers seem to care more about their personal phone calls then their customers agenda."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute disgrace.  Arrived and was seated.  Looked through the menu and there were some good options.   Our party ordered and it was all downhill from there.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta.  The Price was quite a bit and the quality didn't come close, the portion was small and the \"garlic bread\" was 2 breadstick that look like they came from a grade school cafeteria...    My girlfriend and her father ordered steaks both medium rare, they came 10 minutes after everyone else's food and both were well done.  Her daughters Corn-dog from the kids menu was literally sopping with grease.  Applebee's appears, from the menu and the prices, to be a competitor to Chili's but overall is a complete joke.  If you want this style food at the same prices and want it to be good go to Chili's.  Applebee's is an absolute disaster, bad food, small portions and mediocre service.  I would strongly recommend against!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pretty large order for Curbside To Go. A few items were missing from our order. One, quick, phone call to the Manager and everything was replaced...and some. The manager I gave the initial call to was Bruno. He was very efficient and helpful. When I actually picked up the order the manager on site was Shannon. She is amazing! So friendly and took extra special care of our fixed order. I highly recommend this Applebee's. As a chain they have great food. But, local customer service is what will have us return! Thank you Bruno and Shannon,"}
{"text":"We ordered hot Potatoe twisters and they came cold. We ordered a bowl of soup and it was small. We ordered a strawberry mojito without simple syrup and it came with simple syrup. They replaced the hot chips with at least warm chips. We are still waiting on the sliders."}
{"text":"Props to Applebee's on 27th and Bell. I went there for the free Veteran's meal. It was packed but they got me in at the bar right away, and had my meal in front of me within 10 minutes. The whole time Courtney and Kara did an awesome job taking care of us all at the bar. Really great customer service!"}
{"text":"This review is for the to go team. We have ordered numerous times in the last couple months, always pleased with the portions, freshness and time. The food is always delicious. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Reviewing Applebee's and taking some sort of stance on the expectations you had for the dining experience is like buying a used '85 Chrysler Fifth Avenue and then complaining about the poor fuel economy and awful \"presentation.\"    There's a reason I don't eat at chain restaurants - for the most part, they suck.  Nonetheless, at times, we all somehow find ourselves getting seated in the over sized booths amongst the blue hairs and the coloring kids...  THE UP-SIDE:  On the few occasions that I've been to Applebee's, I've found the food to be exactly what I expected - nothing horrid, nothing stellar.  It's decidedly average, just like any good chain should be.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  To be honest, I can't think of any real negative experience I've had at Applebee's.    THE SUM-IT-UP:  Hey, it's a chain.  It sucks.  Taking that into consideration, Applebee's ain't that bad."}
{"text":"Good so far haven't been here in years let ya know when the food gets here and I just got my food and I ordered the blazin Texan w/fries and let's say the fries were better then the burger this is the reason y don't go to places like this tgifridays is so much better stay away the burger didn't even make sense"}
{"text":"Im so disappointed.. This location needs to upgraded new management.. something.. So dirty .. went to sit down had to wipe something off seat.. Menus dirty we decided just order drinks because table was dirty, dividing wall edge dirty had paper crumbled still left on edge ,hand prints and glass separating tables dirty..and cloth they use was being washed with a pot that had water hanging in isle which to me is using same dirty water over and over again. Unacceptable The list goes on. Im not kidding.Get a cleaning crew in there to detail this this.."}
{"text":"this place has won me back! I love burgers! im an American gross darn it haha but they has great food and great customer service! a lot better than b4 so I will now be spending a lot of money at this place again! thanks for the improvement!"}
{"text":"Great food flavor and kid friendly menu. My meal came out on the cooler side and had to be sent back, they microwaved it to heat it up. Server charged our card the wrong amount for the bill and had to fix it so we were delayed in leaving, overall good service, just not happy with the cool pasta."}
{"text":"Worst experience since coming here. We waited for over a half hour for our food and it wasn't crowded. The food on both plates were cold. They brought my husbands back out and it looked like they just threw it into the microwave because the gravy my husband put all over the plate and onion rings was still there and the onion rings were flat. We still ended up paying for the meal."}
{"text":"I love Applebee's.  I use to take all the chicks to Applebee's for a NICE date. Now they take me here haha. Ignore me. The meds are kicking in.  Never come here for lunch. I've always heard about how bad it gets.  It gets crazy busy and yet they do not know how to handle it. Last time I was here with some of the guys from work, maybe 6 of us. Once again someone didn't get their food until the almost very end.  This time it was me. boo. it seems like almost every other time someone in our group gets screwed. SMH  But yet I still love Applebee's because for those who aren't adventurous with their food, as I am, they're usually satisfied with Applebee's."}
{"text":"Good food, variety, Affordable fare, & Pleasant waitstaff are all the makings for a two thumbs up review!   The menu is often changing so the variety of options never really gets old ...  The salads are great! The salmon is delicious and the burgers and such are tasty ....  The portions are perfect... you won't leave hungry !"}
{"text":"There was a miscommunication on our order and they made it right faster than most places would.  We ordered a bunch of half price apps and a burger.  All the food was delicious.  The fried wontons were perfect.  The Asian wings were amazing.  The pretzels were to die for. The steak quesedilla was spot on. The flavoring for the iced tea was a delightful treat.  The music was all older than my 12 year old son, but I loved it.  Our waitress was pleasant and very attentive. Would be back if it were closer to the hotel."}
{"text":"This Applebees is like most other locations. I will say they have very friendly service and attentive managers which is a HUGE factor when deciding where to eat.  Right. Now they are re-pushing their 2/$20 promo and $7 specialty seasonal drinks pretty heavily. All of the marketing thru the resteraunt and on their menu cards talk about one or the other. (A little too much advertising for my taste but that's just me.)  In terms of their food, obviously I think it's generally understood Applebees is a chain and do not have 5 star quality dishes. However, most night for a cheaper sit down service resteraunt they do alright.  Tonight I ordered the Boo Lagoon, spinach and artichoke dip appetizer and Burbon street chicken and shrimp 2/$20 dish. For me personally it became very obvious that some parts of my food were made earlier that day and then heated up to a boiling point when ordered.   Tonight was just not a high win for my table, but it served its purpose."}
{"text":"Waiter was very nice, but he forgot to order our appetizer  we just canceled it....if you come here don't expect speedy service. The food was ok. I would have preferred it warmer. We probably won't be back. Why? Because there are so many other options out there."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend for the day and she suggested going to Applebee's for lunch.  I have to say I was thinking that I would rather go to a \"non-chain\" restaurant.  However, our meal was excellent.  We shared the \"2 for $20\" lunch and had the Spinach Artichoke dip as an appetizer and the new Lemon Chicken served over rice, quinoa and cranberries and topped with a Granny Smith apple relish.  We also had the Oriental Grilled Chicken salad as the second entree.  The chicken in both dishes was cooked to perfection, it was moist and delicious!  Our server was very attentive and service was prompt.  I have to say that I was very impressed and would go there again the next time I visit my friend in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was nice very promptly, o u r waitress was awsome. Just chilling here with my dad on our officially move to Vegas. It's definitely going to be different from living in Oxnard."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch as other local places were packed on a Sunday afternoon.  None of us had been to this location and I, myself, had never been at an Applebee's.  Great first impression!  The waitress, I believe her name was Diane (She said there was two but this one worked sunday opening) was great.  Great service, food, and overall experience."}
{"text":"Um yea...I order french onion soup and it comes out like horrible, mild, practically see through, A PLASTIC SPOON, cheese on the bottom....I order wings and they actually told me they were out of blue cheese dressing, then when I told them to take the wings back they told me to hold on while they double checked....miraculously there was some in the back, had the sampler and the quee Dillan came out with the cook at the end of the meal, cold,  she said she couldn't find who they belonged to...and they tasted horrible....NEVER, EVER, EVER, AGAIN....WORST PLACE"}
{"text":"Do not go to this applebees and Do not order the chicken shrip platter on the 2 for 25 we didnt complain when we were in there but the onions still had the skin on them, they werent even peeled the chicken had flavor but was rubbery  the shimp had no flavor my daughters chicken fingers had 2 ok sized ones and 1 small one that was mostly breading. we like applebees but wont go back to this one and to top it off we saw the waitress try to give are onion rings to someone else"}
{"text":"Came in was seated, then asked to move, and was seated at back by the bathroom where the lights from the phone order pick up shine directly in our faces the entire time we wait. 15 minutes after being seated the waitress finally comes over and says \"sorry for taking forever what can I get you?\" So obviously she was aware that we waited forever and then we get the driest salads ever and of course our waitress is no where to be found, then after the 3rd time of being blinded by the car lights I ask the host to speak to a manager about moving tables,(cause again no waitress in sight) then 16 minutes later my waitress comes over and I ask for the manager and what's going on and she said \"oh who did you ask? The little guy up front? You should've asked me, i'll go get him for you!\" And I respond with, \"well I could t find you...to which she says, \"oh yeah, sorry I wasn't around, you know cause....\" (So obviously she was aware she was not attentive, and when the manager finally came over, and asked what the problem was, he said with a stank ass attitude \"well if you would've asked me of course I would've been happy to move you, it's no problem at all,but as for the lights there isn't any thing I can do, no one else seems to have an issue--thats where our car side pick up is so people are constantly pulling in and out of that lane.\" NEVER DID HE APOLOGIZE FOR THE WAIT, THE SHIT SERVICE, THE BLINDING LIGHTS OR THE FACT THAT WE HAD ALREADY BEEN MOVED ONCE. Even after our waitress said out of her own mouth, \"sorry I wasn't attentive--\" he had a horrible attitude and treated me as if I was the problem, or my issues were trivial and not important, and it was my fault I waited 15 minutes for him. He did offer to move us but after waiting on him so long my party was finished and ready to leave. I didnt eat and had my plate refunded, but that was met with smacked lips and rolled eyes as well. I was too irritated with the lack or professionalism displayed by the wannabe  thug manager with his crappy neck tattoos and giant fake diamond earrings, to even eat, let alone enjoy my night out with friends.  Applebee's has no standards if this is the kind of thing that is considered acceptable at their establishment. Even another waiter I complained too said,\" oh yeah! I don't know why they don't put a curtain on the door or a sign that asks the curbside cars to turn their lights off? I always see spots too because people pull up with their lights on and blind me when i work in that section.\""}
{"text":"I'm at the emergency room as i type this with my innocent child vomiting everything he ingested today. The exact food in solids all over,about every 15 minutes...do NOT EAT HERE     After 8 hours in the ER,we have returned to the entire party that attended dinner,vomiting including myself. I now know it couldn't have been the food,but the person preparing the food as we all had different meals.  Most people would be raising hell and honestly I'm too sick to...I'm just giving the warning this place has some very unsanitary practices or something we are all violently sick"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service my waitress was clumsy (Amy) dropped our silverware on the floor picked it up and gave it to us told her give us fresh silverware. Food was bought out one by one after an hour of a not busy night and it was only apps. Orders chicken quesadillas and they had no chicken on it with lettuce, boneless wings were served cold French onion soup was cold. The fries were nice and hot though. The manager (KIM) exchanged our food and bought out the same garbage and did not even comp our meals. I visited this establishment often this was the worst I have ever encountered at any restaurant of any caliber. I will NEVER visit this specific Applebee's again in life, even though it is 10 minutes from my home. I am very disappointed in this service."}
{"text":"Ordered the strawberry avocado salad and the queso chicken on their Take 2 special menu.  Seems healthy but no calorie count on the menu.  Here is hoping!  The salad is bathed in a sweet and spicy vinaigrette which tastes great but I am sure there is a lot of sugar.  Overall a tasty salad.  The queso chicken tastes great.  Rice, corn, black beans, avocado, chicken all bathed in that queso.  Quite a tasty entree.  If you like these flavors mixed with a lime glaze you will like this dish.   Overall not a bad meal.   Service is friendly but awkward.  Food is slightly above average. Price is about average."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience at this Applebee's.   Recently, I had to take my car to the mechanic and was told it would be a few hours to repair, so I decided to catch an Uber to this Applebee's for some lunch and sports on TV. My server was very good at his job and very attentive, despite how busy the afternoon rush was.   My appetizer, main course, and drink refills were all on point and perfect. The food overall was excellent and my burger was juicy and exactly how I wanted it. In terms of my wait time, I had plenty of time still to play games on the tablet and watch TV and kill time.   My only negative was the family that sat at the table adjacent to me. Their kid was stinking up the place with his smelly diaper and his screaming went on ignored by both parents for like 15 minutes. That's when I decided to catch an Uber back to my mechanic and bail.   Despite that, I give this Applebee's 4-stars for good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Omg!! Slowest service ever. When we walked in, there was no host. So, we went straight to the bar thinking we will get quick service....WRONG!! The place wasn't that busy. There were 2 couples at the bar along with another table that the bartender had. There was a long wait for a greet. She said she had to go find mint for my mojito.we finally got our drinks but was never offered menus. I had to go to the host stand to get my own menus. I ordered water before the meal and the bartender never brought it. I asked for water again by someone who dropped the food off. The food is ok....typical Applebee's food. We finished the appetizer, drinks, and entrees. Nothing was cleared off until she picked up our credit card for payment. What really pissed me off is that a 3-top walked in at the bar and the bartender knew them and she greeted them and got their drinks immediately...I will never go back even if the restaurant was conveniently located behind the hotel."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience ever.  Water is tap water, Waited 1hr for food to be served on a dirty plate. Called mgr over to resolve and he apologized and said he'd get one replaced, after 20 minutes i cancelled it all.. server was very nice but this place is run very poorly........   I woukd not tell any friends to try it"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on Sunday afternoon and the food was outstanding and well worth the money. Our server was good and all the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I love Aoplebees but not this one. Service was bad - things were forgotten, including silverware. We had to flag down a waitress for silverware! My son waves down a waiter because they forgot to put dressing on my mom's salad and he said \"you have to wait\". 5 minutes later he came back. The bathroom was trashed. Just very disappointed in this location for a restaurant I typically love."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was excellent Cierra and Ashley made the whole night.  MyGlass was never empty they were professional friendly and dealt with many many drunk patrons in a kind and professional manner. They made the whole night"}
{"text":"Love coming here its never over crowded  server are nice sometimes they forget to bring you the glass of water or something extra you order like olives, but never the food they always bring it on a good timing and food always delicious"}
{"text":"So it's been about a year since coming here.  They have remodeled and the inside looks nice.  5 person party with a surprise out of town guest.  Steaks were to be medium rare and medium well. Both were very overlooked and the medium rare did not have any pink in the middle.  The ribs were cold when they came out.  My mac and cheese with chicken strips was bland...very bland.   The waitress did keep our drinks consistently full.  However, the food quality has gone way down hill at Applebee's"}
{"text":"I called at 9:15 pm on a Sunday and told them I wanted carside to go. I was told after ordering my simple meal that I would have to come inside to pick it up! Huh? It's carside to go! The young lady told me that they were unable to come outside after a certain hour. Ummmm, ok.....then after a certain hour you should offer TAKE OUT not curbside to go! Do not go to this Applebee's if you want the convenience that they say they offer!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here!  Had a gift card or wouldn't have bothered since food poisoning, (rotten fish) at Prescott location long ago.  After 25 minute wait, the waitress from cell block C finally showed up!  We both ordered 1/2 rack of ribs, the animal must have come from a concentration camp, nothing but bones!!!  Greasy fries, dry, tasteless slaw, even my beer was stale and odd color.  I think the only reason we didn't contract food poisoning is because there wasn't enough edible food to consume. We realized any complaint would be ignored, chalked it up to another bad experience with Applebee's.  Possibly didn't see cockroaches since it was too dark to see the floor.  We often joke, \"want to eat at Applebee's?\" and LAUGH, \"not if starving on a desert island!!!\"  I took their survey, giving lowest marks possible, but as expected, haven't been contacted, clearly NO ONE CARES....Applebee's deserves to go out of business!"}
{"text":"Ordered their House Serloin. It was fatty throughout, tough, couldn't cut through it even though I ordered it medium. The mashed potatoes felt processed and had been sitting for a while and just reheated. I lost all respect for this resturant."}
{"text":"Nathan was trying his hardest to take care of us his a good employee trying to make a living in this crazy world. Unfortunately this management wasn't picking up slack and took away his help which made it nearly impossible for him to be able to take care of all his tables."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour to see what their updated menu items were since we haven't been here in awhile. We sat in the bar area and had pretty decent service. They have some good, cheap drinks and appetizers on the menu. Happy hour is from 3-6. We got our go to spinach dip and trid some of the wonton tacos. Both were good, but I wish there was more to the tacos. I always get their peach sangrias because they're delicious and even better when they're cheap. We ended up ordering some food as well and I have to say, I wasn't really impressed. I used to always get the Chinese chicken salad and thought it was amazing, but this time it didn't taste that great.  It seemed smaller than it used to be too. My boyfriend got the mac n cheese and thought it was just ok. It was kind of dry and the honey sauce that's supposed to be on it, was barely there."}
{"text":"Its applebees what can you expect than the usual.  You don't come here for the service or a luxurious atmosphere. As long as you are treated well and keep your drinks filled at all times you are golden, and this location did that. I usually just go to Applebees for their happy hour drinks and food(you cant beat their $.55 bone in wings). Food was slow to come out thats the reason for the 4 stars but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Yeah,  not a good night.....my well done steak was barking. Since I'm a regular I'm gonna attribute it to new folks in the back."}
{"text":"I was in the area with family today looking for lunch. Since I  wasnt familiar qith the area I used Yelp and the first place I saw was Applebees.    There was an offer to check in and receive a free app (up to $12.50) with the purchase of an entre√©, and another offer for mentioning yelp to get 15% off total bill. What a sweet deal!!  For the free app we got the wonton taco with chicken  (4/5). We ordered fish tacos (3/5) with a side of 4 cheese macaroni & bacon (4/5) and another entre√© with mashed potatoes, sirloin steak,  topped with gravy and onion rings (3.5/5). The mac & cheese was pretty good. We ordered another side of it!  The total bill came out to $40 after the 2 promos.  Thank you Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"I guess it is what it is, cheap and fast, git a salad with the wrong dressing, guy dropped it and ran away without asking if everything was ok, I couldn't even tell him about the wrong dressing, I ate it dry until I actually got the dressing. Dad's shrimp were raw, and my full rack of  ribs sauce on the side, came as a half rack with sauce. Did get my rack pretty quick though after telling the server!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Had the side salad with ruble tots off the two for twenty. The new sweet potato fries are a great addition to the menu."}
{"text":"We gave this place a few chances.   But the service is always horrible. The drinks are the worst! They really need to get a bartemder who knows what he is doing... The one they have is always staring at the game and takes forever just to serve a beer...the cocktails always taste like alcohol and sweetner, so gross."}
{"text":"Easily the best service I received in a local restaurant. I say that because I've eaten at some nice strip restaurants.... And even then this server gave them a run for their money.   Jesus is an amazing server and my kids absolutely loved him.... I wish he was a manny on the side."}
{"text":"I was in here today, and while the food was excellent, the server ruined the entire experience. Chrystal was rude and inattentive. We sat for many minutes before she walked by and said (with a grown) \"I'll be with ya'll eventually.\" After another 2-3 minutes she finally came to the table, by this time we had already decided what we were going to eat, so we gave her the whole order. She said she would put the order in and bring our drinks right back. She left for a few more minutes, came back and checked in with another table without our drinks. She then went to get our drinks. She checked in with us multiple times throughout our meal just in passing, and not acknowledging when we needed more drinks and forcing us to either put empty glasses to the end of the table or request them. About halfway through eating, she brought us the check, never inquiring if we would want dessert. When she came back 5-10 minutes later, we had long since finished eating and asked for 2 boxes. She brought the boxes and my 6 year old had decided to take her leftovers home as well, so we asked for a third, only for her to promptly roll her eyes at the table and walk away without acknowledging our request verbally. When she came back, a member of my party outstretched her hand to take the box and begin packaging the leftovers, when Chrystal looked right at her and put the box on the end of the table, just out of her reach. After the check was paid and we stood up to leave, I witnessed Chrystal do a celebratory dance that we were leaving. Very visible and inappropriate. I understand that her shift was probably over, but I am disgusted that this is the way that servers are allowed to act in this establishment and will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Really torn between a 2* or a 3* review. Came in for Easter late lunch/early dinner. We had server Jennifer A and she was busy with a large party that was leaving so we could see that she wasn't going to get to us right away. The issue of this review does not lie with the food. The food was OK. The shrimp spiral pasta was surprising small vs the huge plate that it was on. But other than that, food was OK  So the server needs to work on her time management. She took a long time getting chip refills (after the salsa was taken away. Also after the spinach dip came out) and when my friend asked for her dessert first and before dinner. I had to remind her about it and by then the food came out before the dessert. Which was a tiny shooter mind you. Another thing that got to me was her rudeness when we asked of she could do/take something away from the table. Not apologies or kindness. Just an \"I'm busy and have my hands full\" then she walked away. She was not a very professional server and poorly handled her situation when she was in the weeds."}
{"text":"No ham. No burger. Omg. Went to try the all you can eat chicken and rib let's. As I was eating my food and enjoying my mango lemonade. Which was good. I noticed my server on the floor cleaning the booth. The table pushed the walk way. And the seat flipped on its side. AAWH. HELL NAW. REALLY. AND NO GLOVES ON. I asked him is it customarily the protocol to clean and serve. He stated management has a pushed to clean. Needless to say. I tried giving him the benefit of doubt that he uses the hand washing concept. But my OCD got the best of and lost my appetite. My date even left a tip in spite of. However no sir. No ma'am. Will never do that LOCATION"}
{"text":"Service tonight a bit slow. Wife's stir fry had too much sauce with uncooked rice. My bourbon steak was flavourful but the toughest piece of meat I've had in years. The knife could barely cut it.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food.  Pretty much what you would expect from a chain restaurant in this category.  I normally wouldn't do dinner out here but they are open late and have lots to choose from.  The service is good and the prices for a meal are reasonable.  They do have good deals on small appetizers and drinks if that's your thing, with a large group of friends it could be a pretty good time."}
{"text":"Bartenders and servers couldn't be better. Menu is blah and the food isn't much better."}
{"text":"Went in with my daughter for just some appetizers, nothing big. Upon arriving I was greeted by Erik, who sat us in a section that idk even know of there was a server. Nobody came over to say anything or offer us water or anything. I saw Erik again so I asked him to seat us elsewhere, somewhere that has a server. He apologized & quickly sat us in Ninas section who took our quick Water and Wonton Taco order which were delicious as usual. Nina was nice and friendly and very quick. I can tell shes a hard working mama on a mission. So thank youu nina for turning our night into a good one. I will never know if \"shaun\" was a good server or not because he never came over to say anything. We would have been good with a \"ill be right with you\" but not even that. It looked like a slow night, idk if maybe everybody kinda came in all at once or what the deal was but communication with your guests is key."}
{"text":"The service was good. I had Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp. Food was good and fair price."}
{"text":"I only come here for the Mac N Cheese  food is good, but nothing in the world tastes like this macaroni. One time I had a burger, it was great, but I got mac n cheese to go. Never come here without ordering the macaroni & cheese."}
{"text":"Really good experience! After reading reviews, I was nervous to come, but we decided to come anyways because we had plans to meet a friend for dollar margaritas! Went on a week night, they had a decent bit of people inside so it was nice. Service was quick, dollar Rita's tasted really good and you can customize flavor for 25 cents! Can't beat the deal. We decided to eat and all ordered different burgers and fries. They were very filling, pink inside, meaty, and perfect! Very surprisingly happy with our visit. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in years.  Left a 10% tip when I normally leave 20-25%.  15-20 periods without seeing the waitress, seemed annoyed when we wanted receipt and not use the auto machine on the table."}
{"text":"I went into Applebee's and it was very understaffed. I waited for 20 minutes and no one said hello to me. I started at the bar and worked my way to the front booth no luck anywhere. I left, Olive Garden's down the street."}
{"text":"Applebee is one of our favorite places to eat. This is my forst time atbthe Northern location and they did not disappoint me at all. Great food, great service as usual."}
{"text":"First time ordering online although I been to this location previously.  Online process was smooth, was able to use a $5.00 off coupon.  Bought the 2 for $20 deal.  Standard burger was very good, bacon and onion are cut small.  I originally thought they were missing.  Definitely order extra bacon! Boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks we're decent, the mashed potatoes were lacking in taste. Big plus that bags of food have a sticker with name of employee who has  checked order for accuracy."}
{"text":"We came here again, and I have to say the service was better. I mean, the waitresses still seemed like they could have used a bit of help, but they were a lot faster and very friendly!! Our food came out great!!! Super delicious!!! I ordered To Go tonight and my order was precise and tasted great!!! So I'm much more satisfied than last time. Thanks for the improvements, keep it up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner. We were seated quickly although the host seemed confused on where to seat us. He had a great attitude and we didn't think much of it. The restaurant seemed fairly empty. We sat for a few minutes looking over the menus and about after 10 minutes began to wonder when we would be greeted by our server. She came over a few minutes later and took my boyfriend's order. He ordered one burger and the waitress started to walk away from or table. She didn't even acknowledge that I wanted to order as well. It made no sense at all! So I grabbed her attention before she walked away that I wanted to order too and she said \"Oh ok.\" So I gave her my order and we never saw her again. 25 minutes went by and we started to wonder where our food was, let alone our drinks. After about 30 minutes, possibly more, the manager came over to our table and explained to my boyfriend that they were out of the pulled pork they use on the burger he had ordered, and offered to use brisket instead. My boyfriend said that didn't sound satisfying and wasn't sure about that idea. The man insisted it would taste great, and described the brisket. My boyfriend explained that we were on a time limit as he had to leave for work, and how we really didn't have much time to spare as we planned to be close to done by then. The man said he would have the burger done right away. He decided to accept the offer, and the manager left us. We decided we did not want to wait for our food any longer, as it shouldn't take over 30 minutes to inform us that they are out of meat for an entree... So I tried to locate our waitress to cancel the order, and I found her standing behind a wall talking with other employees out of view. I guess those drink orders or vital information weren't really that important to her. I told her to cancel the order and why and she didn't apologize, she just said \"ok.\" We won't be back here, the customer service we received was extremely poor!"}
{"text":"I agree with a few others who wrote that the drinks are watered down. If I wanted a cup of ice I would ask for it.  We are not coming back  once you loose a couple you loose them forever."}
{"text":"I've lived in Henderson for 2 years and had not visited... Got a free entree for my birthday. (love those to explore new restaurants).   I ordered the free entree and also an appetizer as I was super hungry and was looking forward to the go-box.   I ordered a pasta chicken and the sriracha (sp) shrimp. The chicken was bland and the pasta tasteless;  and the shrimp was soggy...  and needless to say I went home without the go box. Service was slow, so I did not stay to talk to the manager.   Instead of writing on Yelp to be seen by everyone, I wrote them directly.  I did receive a call from a person named \"S....\" via voicemail.  I called back twice to see what she had to say, and left messages Both times.  Need I say I've never heard back.  I am so disappointed that a restaurant to close to me is not one I'll go back to."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was awful.  Waiter Javey was prompt with our order and bringing the food, but very inattentive and forgetful on other things.  We asked him twice for lemons for our drinks and, after waiting about 20 minutes, got up and got them ourselves at the bar.  It was my and my guest's birthday, and our wives mentioned it to him TWICE (out of our earshot) and asked about the birthday dessert.  He gave them an attitude and never did bring it until the manager was called and ordered him to do it.  At the end of the meal, I asked twice for a go cup for my soda and again, never got it until the manager came around to check on it.  I did leave him a $4 tip on a $52 bill because I thought he deserved something for the service he did render, but after finding out about his attitude on the desserts, I would have left him nothing.  Hoping the manager gets this straightened out before we go back.  We really like Applebee's food."}
{"text":"I love going to Applebee's. The service is always amazing. The kids have a great time as well. Servers are always so polite and know exactly how to do their jobs correctly. The food is always amazing and not long of a wait. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Ok service. Bad food!! Food was cold and inedible! Won't go back!! Would not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Wow!  AMAZING service!    We went there to celebrate my birthday (be sure to join Applebee's loyalty club because they e-mail you a coupon for a free entree on your birthday!) and they honored our coupon even though I had not noticed that it was technically only redeemable at a different Applebee's location.  Very classy!    More importantly, the lovely manager, Abeer, was so gracious and cheerful about it.  Instead of making us feel like she just did us a big favor by bending the rules for us, she was just delighted that we had found her Applebee's store, and she wanted me to have a wonderful time celebrating my birthday at \"her\" store.  I actually thought she must be the owner of the business, she was so warm and welcoming.  After the meal, she stopped by again to make sure everything had been to our liking, and I told her she had been so welcoming that I thought she must be the owner, and she actually started to mist up at the compliment.  What a lovely lady!  She must also be a solid manager, too, because EVERYTHING about our time there was spot-on: from the warm welcome at the door, to smiling friendly servers, to hot food being served piping hot and cooked as requested, to our check being brought over immediately when we were ready for it, to drinks being refilled promptly, etc.!    This isn't the closest Applebee's to our house, but we signed my hubby up for the loyalty club for THIS Applebee's location and we'll make the extra drive to come back here!  Abeer, if you are reading this, thank you for making me feel like a total VIP on my birthday!  You are a fantastic manager and if I owned any service business, I would have made you a competing job offer on the spot.  I am sure you have been a key to the success of every place you have ever worked!"}
{"text":"I will give it three stars the service is extra slow we have been waiting over 60 minutes for our main dishes. The place is not crowded so I fail to see the problem. The staff seem a little extra over worked and tired. I give it 3 stars. We just waited to long and once we got our dishes hump they were wrong yet we didn't send them back out of fear of starving to death."}
{"text":"Do not go for the food. This one for drinking only, my opinion. Nice staff though. The chicken wings, greasy .  Don't bother"}
{"text":"Just like any other franchise its a hit or miss.  This particular Applebees is a miss.  The waiter we had wasnt attentive and didnt even provide us with a napkin or eating utensils.  It wasnt just our waiter either all the tables had the same problem either not refilling your drink, bringing out cold food, or walking around with no purpose because you forgot the purpose.  I have ate at other locations like  Goodyear and they were great and that was at 1am in the morning and this Applebees couldnt get it together at 4pm."}
{"text":"Give this place one star I went there on a Tuesday afternoon the place was dead empty I ordered a hamburger and french fries with the cheese on the side I got the burger added my condiments to it and cut it in half as I normally do the burger was  stone cold in the center I asked the waitress if she can send it back and have it refired because it's raw she rolled her eyes and said Okay this is my third bad experience at this Applebee's location this Applebee's is in desperate help of new management and new cooking and waiting staff I will go the extra 15 minutes to the mentor Applebee's where their more experienced and a prideful restaurant"}
{"text":"I am not much of a fan of Applebee's but if it is late and you are looking for something affordable and casual this is a good option. The late night happy hour (after 9pm) is a great deal with drink specials and half price appetizers. I met up with a friend thinking we were just going to grab a very late dinner but we ended up snacking on some appetizers. The chicken wonton tacos were delicious! The spinach and artichoke dip was nothing special but tasty. They also had a special on Bahama Mamas for under $4.  The service was good but the place really needs a deep cleaning."}
{"text":"The food here was ok, as most restaurants of this caliber tend to be. None of the appetizers came out piping hot, which is the main reason for my rating. Eating lukewarm food is never something I enjoy doing. My entree however, the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp, came out hot and sizzling as it is served on a cast iron plate. Applebee's is just one of those places where I don't expect a fine dining experience but I go for a quick and budget friendly meal. Happy hour is from 3-6pm, and for the month of February they're offering $1 Bahama Mamas."}
{"text":"Good food decent prices and consistent service. No matter what time of day or how many people I go with always decent."}
{"text":"First time at this Applebee's. Had trepidation about the service, based on previous reviews. Service was just fine, with quick seating, friendly greeting and just the right amount of attention.   My wife ordered the Seasonal Berry and Spinach Salad and wine while I had the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and a Strawberry Lemonade.   The salad was fresh and light but they forgot the pecans. My wife always likes crunch with her salads, so that was a key missing piece for her.   My entree was tasty but needed help. The cheese sauce was so thin that it didn't cling to the pasta. Also the chicken was SO sweet that the flavor of the chicken (and pasta) got lost. The breadstick was a nice touch, as it was very similar to the mouth watering Olive Garden bread. Not a bad meal, just needed some tweaking to the recipe.   We will try Applebee's again, but not the Mac 'N Chicken."}
{"text":"I have been here maybe a couple of times. But this night we waited so late to eat after they Bill Bellamy show.  We were in and out.  Keren our waitress was a bad A$$!  She took all 4 of our orders, with her hands on her hips.. she never wrote down anything!!  We got ALL of our food \"exactly\" how we ordered it.  She was on us with extra water, drinks, etc.  she checked on us the whole time. Amazing service.  She should be a Manager!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I order the four-wheeled Mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken and everytime there is no cheese on it..I always have to ask for extra cheese and they have the nerve to charge me for it...very frustrated...might just stop going all together.."}
{"text":"I went here for a hurried lunch with a large number of co-workers. The food was hot and tasty, and the service was friendly and quick.We were in and out and back to work on time."}
{"text":"I seriously went to this place because I had a gift card and it was close to the golf course I was playing on a Sunday afternoon.  I walked away impressed.  Had queso and chips as an appetizer and it was great.  Had a nice subtle zing to it, which I appreciated.  The chips were warm and crisp.  For my main meal I had a blue cheese burger with a veggie burger substitution.  The fact that this Applebees has veggie burgers is awesome, and that too one that tastes good is like icing on the cake.    Service was excellent, food was good, price was right.  We sat by the bar with a plethora of big screen TVs so I could catch the golf tournament and the Laker's game at the same time.  Not a bad way to spend dinner.    In summary, it may not be the most unique place, but it gets the job done and its actually quite good."}
{"text":"Ate here on 4/29/17 and got food poison.  Had the hamburger with salad and got sick within an hour.  Took a couple trips to the dump.   We are not planning to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed. This was our second time getting to go from this location. It was very disappointing. The mozzarella sticks were not even warm. The bourbon chicken had nearly raw onions instead of caramelized onions, to the point they were not edible. Being that there is an additional charge for the bourbon chicken just raises the frustration. I had a really long day and depended on a $50+ dinner being good and as ordered. I most likely will not return to this location. Way to make a customers experience memorably bad."}
{"text":"Menus were old, dirty and torn...manager talked to 3 tables around us because they had issues. Our food came out wrong but we didn't feel like waiting for more. The manager seemed to handle himself and the customers well...that's honestly the only thing that impressed me. 3 visits and poor service/surroundings."}
{"text":"I went out with the hubbi this eve. Well I will say it could be better but it's just your typical random Applebee's ...ahhh...they didn't fix my drink right. In my Sir Charles Barkley voice it was terrible. Then I sent that back the first drink & took a picture of the 2nd drink. The over all service was two star worthy. But I'm feeling gracious tonight so a 3 is what I will give them. Should u view my pictures you will see I had shrimp & salad. Will I return hmmmm I guess. (Rolls my eyes) they could have done better."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at an AppleBees in a long time... We had a few appetizers the pulled pork sliders, shrimp. The appetizers were good. I had a steak and my son had a burger, my wife had a salad. Overall the food was good and we must have got a good waitress because I can't complain about the service. I can't say it's a place I will rush to visit again, but if I am in the area I would stop by."}
{"text":"Its Applebees, nothing wow about it, just the happy hour deal. Came to this place one evening on a weekday with my brother and his Fiance for drinks. There was a woman at the table next to us who honestly should had been cut off a long time ago, she was so sauced up, loud and obnoxious that our time spent there was ultimately just unpleasant, after much observation, she seemed to know the staff, what do you know, she works there. UNPROFESSIONAL. Not returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"We Decided to go to Applebee's for Lunch as Our car was getting Serviced and this was close by, we was greeted almost straight away and was able to get a beer, after studying the menu, we decided to get 2 for $25 plus a appetiser, we got boneless chicken wings with honey coating, we was presented with BBQ when we said we got the wrong flavour we was told that this was Honey BBQ we did not order BBQ and there was no way this was honey bbq, it looked like they had just emptied a jar of bbq sauce over the wings, so much so that My husband could not eat them, there is a big Difference between honey and bbq sauce and this was just bbq sauce poured on top of the wings terrible, then My main came I had the steak medium well but it came out medium rare, My husband wanted stir fry the meat on my dish and his was tough and I mean tough, we would have had another desert and another Samuel Adams beer but trying to tell us BBQ sauce was honey and then having meat tough as old nails and not cooked the way we wanted it, put us off. we was served by Isabel O at 13:50 on 06.23.16 we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Hands down...the best Applebees I've ever been to. Our server, Caylan, was amazing and the manager was super friendly. Our food came fast, our drinks were always full, and she even got us drinks to go without even having to ask her. The restaurant was cozy and very clean. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend going to this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Star 1: the atmosphere being decent.  Star 2 is for the service. It was nothing out of this world but still done well.   No third star for food quality. I ordered boneless wings which I have enjoyed at other Applebee's and these ones were pretty good just a little chewy. The nachos were horrible! I loved their old ones but these new ones were not very good. Everything on it was pretty cold and gross.  No fourth star because those nachos definitely weren't worth the 11 bucks I paid for them. The wings were priced well at 50 cents though.  No fifth star because I was definitely not wowed by this experience."}
{"text":"Service has been good here.  Food has been decent.  I like going there because it is pretty much consistent."}
{"text":"We got a giftcard for Christmas so we thought we'd give Applebees another try.  My son actualy insisted I write this review during our dinner so some of this review will contain his words.  Caught up to hubby and son at Applebees after a PTA meeting and they had already ordered appetizers. The cheesesticks were pretty basic. Cheesy, crispy, and not bad though the marinara was bland. The steak quesadilla thing was decent too. I'm sorry I don't know exactly what its called...that's what son called it. It was like a burrito though and not a quesadilla but I don't care enough to go look. Again, the flavor was ok, but just not sure what to expect.  Dinner however was just blah. Hubby and our friend each ordered the Quesadilla burger. Both said it was totally bland. Hubby had coleslaw which was overdressed. Friend had french fries which were crispy and hot but bland. Hubby added mayo and ketchup and that still didn't help the burger though.   I had the 3 cheese chicken penne. Bland. Thank god they put diced tomatoes in it or there wouldn't be any color to it either. The pasta was overcooked and also appeared to have been sitting around in another vessel before I got it because it was very oddly bent for penne.  My son had a rueben. He's used to the ruebens at Archie's Deli which are A-MAZING. This one at Applebees was so very salty that he couldn't eat it. The meat wasn't fresh and the saurkraut was clearly from a can. He was very disappointed and after 3 bites informed me that I better Yelp this restaurant because it's TERRIBLE and people need to know.  Now the only saving grace was our server. I didn't catch her name but she was friendly, polite, unintrusive, and kept our drinks filled. She brought the food out while it was hot rather than letting it sit in the window and the crappy food wasn't her fault at all. That's the only reason Applebees didn't get 1 star."}
{"text":"Just left and I regret paying for what the employees call, \"food\" and \"service.\" We arrived at 545pm and were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. Upon surveying the restaurant, I noticed that less than half of the tables were filled with patrons... wtf??? Fine, we sit down and wait.... and wait... and wait... four customers left while we were waiting and still we were never seated. FINALLY we are seated at 609pm and our server took our order at 611pm.   Chips and artichoke dip arrives a short while after with about 14 tortilla chips to go with our artichoke dip... uh... okay... seems like an appropriate amount of chips (sarcasm)... oh wait, we ran out. Shoot! So we ask for more and wait again... and wait...  After 15 minutes we finally get more chips (18 this time, holla!!!) It is now 649pm and our food is nowhere to be found, much like our server. There are no typos here, you read right, a 39 MINUTE TICKET TIME! that may be some kind of record. I spoke to the manager who tried to blame it on being busy but I quickly shut that down by showing him that he had more empty tabled than filled ones. Meanwhile, there were more people waiting to be seated than there were sitting at tables. Unfortunately the manager didn't seem to care at all.   Yay! We finally got our food, but wait it's awful! My wife's chicken strips are closer in size to nuggets, my sons slider is so burnt that it cant be propely recognised as beef anymore. My burger has some nasty sauce on it that the server failed to mention when I asked her what all it had on it. So now I have to wait for my meal to be made again. Not to mention, my $1.49 onion ring \"upgrade\" included five onion rings about 1\"-1.5\" in diameter. By the time my burger arrived again, my entire family had finished eating and I had to take it to go.   Needless to say, I'm never going back to Applebees and don't recommend anyone else visit this location. This poor excuse of a meal and service wasn't worth the money spent and even if it had been free, I'd rather pay for good food and service."}
{"text":"I love Applebee's but this location always seem to disappoint me. Whenever I decide to try something new on the menu, they never have what I want available. I always end up settling for something that I can possibly make at home :/ but overall, it's not a bad hang out spot especially if you're local."}
{"text":"I ordered a Montreal steak sandwich with onion rings! The amount of cheese on the sandwich was ridiculous!!! Over flowing into the plate! There was a small bowl with cheese as if the amount of cheese wasn't enough! I could barely pick up the sandwich! If chef Ramsey saw this he would tell the chef to get the hell out of the kitchen! The onion rings are good!! Very large onion rings with good flavor"}
{"text":"I don't go to Applebee's in general very often, but I do remember the food being decent.  Not the case at this location (Warm Springs/215).  We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, they were barely cooked.  Cheese not even slightly melted on the inside.  I got a steak, ordered medium and got just below well done.  It was seasoned nice though but why even ask how I want it cooked if you're not going to get it even close.  My friend got the chicken finger mac n cheese and she said it was pretty substandard. We both agreed that this is basically Denny's quality food but at twice the price."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Applebee's in general, however they typically have good French Onion Soup and my 10-year old wanted that & salad tonight. After being seated, we waited several minutes before our server took our drink order. (I had enough time to read the entire menu, the supplemental menu and all of the table flyers/specials.) When I gave our drink order, I placed an appetizer order as well. We were practically done with our sweet potato fries before our dinner order was taken. Then it turned out they were out of French Onion Soup - the whole reason for our visit. My daughter settled on a Caesar salad, and I ordered Tomato Basil Soup and more sweet potato fries. When our food finally arrived 20 minutes later my soup looked like it had been sitting out so long the top had congealed. My daughter's drink sat empty from before we even got our food. Overall it took an hour to get a water, a soda, two orders of fries, a small salad and a bowl of soup. The second star was only because they removed the soup from my bill."}
{"text":"Great service, which counts for a lot. The food was only standard though. I asked for my steak medium and it was cooked well. They charged $5 for kids Mac and cheese that was not good."}
{"text":"I'm so mind blown at the service we just received by Robert. So well mannered and his service was so exceptional. I haven't been to Applebee's in so long and he made me want to come here more often. Thank you Robert for being so amazing!"}
{"text":"Last night had the worst experience at an Applebee's that I have ever had.  We were seated pretty quickly but waiting for our food took forever.  Over an hour.  The waitress barely acknowledged our wait.  She did say once it was coming right out, but that was still 30 minutes before the food showed up.  Then when it did my brother's side was incorrect. She said she was going to get the right side and that took another 10 minutes. When she dropped it off she said nothing.  She eventually blamed the kitchen, which could have been true, but her lack of friendliness didn't do much for the experience. I'm I afraid for the first time in my life I tipped accordingly to the service. If was just too bad to do otherwise.  I'm usually a good tipper, but not last night. I can't imagine going back there."}
{"text":"We would like to personally thank Rebecca the manager for the wonderful service she provided to my brother and his friends for prom. I was given bad information for my brother and his friends for prom night but Rebecca worked everything out and was so wonderful to have a table waiting and ready when they arrived. Thank you, thank you, thank you that was so awesome that you were able to do that."}
{"text":"Just had the slowest service. I ate my whole meal without anything to drink. I ordered my drink 10 min before my food arrived. This is insane."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20+ yrs. ...progressively worse and worse. Tonight was awful!  Had to ask for silverware and napkins!  The card reader didn't work. ...food was mediocre!  I'm done!"}
{"text":"We arrived and were seated quick.  Our server came over right away and asked us what we wanted to drink. She was nice however she didn't do much for us.  For one she dropped a fork and kinda laughed it off. The whole time she took our order she had dirty dishes. I've been a server myself and I would have never done that. Never refilled our water cups however she constantly was aware of the customers behind us. I know that Mexican people have a bad rep. about tipping so I'm not sure if that's why she didn't pay much attention to us. It took very long to bring me my other drinks. She also would ask us a question,we would answer and mid sentence she would walk away. Overall the food was good but the service was pretty bad. I would never come back to this location.."}
{"text":"I give it four stars the service could be a bit faster. Their is no need to wait for drinks for over an hour. Otherwise the food is great!"}
{"text":"Overall, I'm pleased with this location.  The staff is friendly and aims to please.  They have take out service and you can call ahead to make a reservation no matter how many (or little) people you have so you don't have to wait in line!  The food is good and they make every attempt to meet your needs and or dietary requirements.  My only complaint is the placement of the tables.  I always try to get a booth because the tables are placed very close to each other and you usually end up bumping chairs with the person behind you.  Other than that, Applebees's is a great place to go both for food or drinks."}
{"text":"This Applebee's has gone downhill dramatically. The service was terrible. Our waitress asked \"are you ready to order or do you need another minute?\" I responded yes, implying we were ready to order and she walked away, obviously misunderstanding my response. She then disappeared on numerous occasions and I even spotted her counting her tips while we waited for our drinks. We waited nearly 45 minutes for our food. Then the kitchen screwed up our order. After having to hunt down our waitress to tell her the order was messed up we waited another 15 minutes for the right meal. Both dishes were over cooked, the first one that was correct was extremely over cooked. We spent over an hour and a half in this restaurant, only saw our waitress maybe 4 times aside to when we went looking for her. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because they discounted us on the meal that was screwed up... Will not be going to this Applebee's again! Terrible service, terrible food... terrible experience. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I do really REALLY wish they would actually have their blondie come out SIZZLING like they used to.  Why serve it on a griddle when you aren't going to have it even hardly hot??  Service was not great at all.  Yes, we were a larger group, but the place wasn't that busy and our server kept disappearing and there were many times our drinks were empty for longer than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I go here fairly often... usually the one on Happy Valley road (which doesn't have the capability to review) but this one is my backup...  Happy hour at \"Happlebee's\" is a lot of fun.  $2 beers, $3 well drinks... who doesn't want that after a long hard day at work?  The service is great... they pay attention very well and they are very nice.  And if you're back more than once, they usually remember you.  Now that's pretty cool. :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by admitting to not being a big Applebee's guy. The food is ~okay~ and I've had terrible experiences at other locations. Not at this one, however. It has been slow, but even then it wasn't due to server inattentiveness. I would definitely suggest bringing a light sweater because even in July, it's too cold in there. I love the staff here; our waitress last time was perfection. Plus: liquor. Happy hour here WINS. My MAIN issues with it is the temperature, and the fact that it can get very, very loud in there very quickly. And if you are one of the poor sobs that gets there during a dinner rush, I'll light a candle for you."}
{"text":"Took the fam here for Saturday night dinner, was largely a disappointment. While the staff is friendly and attentive, the food quality is still suspect. I had the sirloin and whole grains from the light choices menu. The steak was ok, but the whole grains tasted moldy. This chain continues to define mediocrity in the food service industry."}
{"text":"Everything was gross this time and the service was terrible. This location may actually ruin applebees for me forever."}
{"text":"My sister and I went out for a \"sisters nite out\" this passed Saturday night. We found ourselves at this wonderful Applebee's location. We were greeted and quickly seated. I loved the fact they played oldie but goodie songs while I  enjoyed a delicious and tasty meal with my sister.  The waitress was great as she provided outstanding service. I am happy to have found a friendly place to dine out."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner with my sister here today after a long day at the office. The meal was great, the place was clean and the waitress was on point with refills and also had checked back on us very 10 mins.  The only thing that I had a problem with during this visit that cost the establishment 2 stars from this review was that the receipt came not $5 nor $10 short but $20... yes $20 short. The manager was informed of the issue and the money was quickly recovered and paid back to us."}
{"text":"I had a chicken sandwich with a house salad . The food was very fresh and flavorful. But we were a little up set by the service. It was so slow that the appetizer came after the food.  Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First off they were not even busy and secondly we waited over 10 mins for a waiter to acknowledge us. No water no nothing! Horrible service at this location! Won't be coming back! We walked out and drove up the street to Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"This is the second Applebee's that I tried in the last year.  I went again to this one for a simple lunch with a friend, and we decided to try the 2 for $20 special again.  Once again, I was disappointed -- so I must remember to honor the old saying, \"fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me\".  We shared the one appetizer, and we selected the fried mozzarella sticks.  They were bad and hard.  My friend order the SW shrimp and pasta dish and that looked pretty bad (I did not get a chance to taste it).  I ordered the three cheese pasta and grilled chicken.  There was some cheese on the pasta -- I could taste it, but there was no sauce or liquid -- just dry, cooked pasta, that tasted cheesy.  And my chicken was burnt and dry and overcooked.  The whole dish was disturbingly dry and bad!!    I know that what they show on their TV advertising and on their menus are \"doctored\" and \"made up\" dishes to make them \"show\" better for advertising purposes.  But what they actually serve is pretty bad and that is a travesty.    I think the other \"semi-fast food\" places like Olive Garden, Chili's, and Red Lobster, have better food.  And I think Applebee's would be better off (or perhaps their customers) if they provided small salads instead of the sickly \"one appetizer to share\" option.  So if anyone ever sees me write another Applebee's review, slap me up against the side of my head!!"}
{"text":"As my father struggles to finish his dry pork chop my wife and I had to send our orders back (my chicken was very tough, the wife's dish was missing the shrimp that was described on the menu).  I've been here on occassion...I fear won't be anymore. Although our server was gracious her manager gave a half hearted apology. Our meals were redone. My meal was better, the wife's not much more.  Now I just discovered the digital pay unit was for another table. The hits just keep coming.  To say I'm never coming back would be an understatement."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Placed an order to go and was told my food would be ready by 7:17pm. Got here at 7:20 with all car side to go full, had to go inside and wait nearly 15mins to NOT being greeted or asked about my food. Horrible service and restaurant wasn't even busy. Ended up walking out with no food smh. NEVER coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Jennifer and it took awhile to get our drink order which was fine but our food took awhile which was delivered by another person  and my mashed was cold so they replaced them my ribs were dry and hardly had any sauce on them I am guessing our food sat in the window awhile .server had a party of about 10 people whom I noticed were getting excellent service ..we have been to this applebees b4 and had excellent service from a waitress named Kat .very disappointed this time Jennifer would have known the ribs were awful if she had at least come by once to check back but never did ..she took excellent care of her large party .I usually don't complain because I to am a server but there was no reason for her not to come by at least once to check on our dinner we were just a party of two ..I did tip but she did miss out on a very large tip because of our service .hope large party tipped well cause she only took care of them"}
{"text":"We ordered the appetizer platter and it was so so, the spinach artichoke dip was not good and it was just creamed spinach and needed some seasoning. My Fiesta Lime chicken was good though. The service was good and fast as we said we were in a hurry. The mashed potatoes needs more seasoning too. But not spicy just salt and maybe garlic.  Bad side was a screaming baby right behind me, that is the parents fault though."}
{"text":"This location is the worst!! Food was not good at all and this will be my last time eating here!! The food has gone down hill for many years now. They used to be one of my favorite places. Done with them."}
{"text":"good food  and good  prompt   service  2  orders  for  ruben sandwich  and 1  club sandwich.  when in t5he mood, I  shall  return."}
{"text":"I cannot remember ever having a good meal at any Applebees anywhere.  I ordered a side of veggies with my dinner and cook didn't have the common decency to strain the veggies which left  a rapidly cooling water in the bottom of my plate.  Which in turn made my entire meal unpleasant and extra soggy.   This restaurant is such a disgrace, and I use the word restaurant very loosely.   I will be avoiding Applebees in the future."}
{"text":"Waiter is ok. Food is bad. Cold food and waited forever till anyone came to get our drink order. Worst experience."}
{"text":"Save your money and your time!! Wouldn't give this place one star. Awful service from walking in to walking out. Made the mistake of celebrating my birthday here. Never visiting again. Super long wait for food. Manager and servers sitting at booths on their cell phones."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The servers have always been really great, except once, when the dude was a total idiot. Food is consistent and good. It's your typical cookie cutter franchise."}
{"text":"I always come here , for happy hour , especially on Thursdays for karaoke , majority of which I have good service , this past Thursday 4/4/14 we had a new server that we've never had before Noe R. , excellent service , and not just with us , I noticed how he was hit the rest of his section . Definitely will be asking for his section in the future . We also usually get the trio sampler appetizer , wings , mozz sticks & wonton tacos & out of all the other times we've gotten this , this time was the best , service , drinks , food and music was on point !"}
{"text":"This experience was the most terrible one I've had yet to encounter. I have came to Applebee's my entire life and have had no problems up until tonight. My boyfriend and I had a new waitress who was the sweetest girl ever, she was no where near the problem. Our food took 35 minutes to come out and was cold, didn't have much sauce on top, and looked like it had been sitting for hours. We requested to leave but insisted to stay due to the manager. The manager came and didn't seem to care much at all. He said he would take down our check slightly due to inconvenience and assured us the food would be out in under 5 minutes. Around 18 minutes later our new wings had came out. They were the same exact wings, sauceless and looked as if they were thrown in the oven for 3 minutes if that. They still were cold so we requested the bill and to leave. We paid and shortly realized he didn't comp anything and in fact charged us for our drinks twice! Mine of which were free refills and my boyfriend finished his one and then requested water. It's a shame I've been coming here loyally since I was a little girl and it took this one unfair experience to change my outlook. They overcharged us, gave us cold/old food, and took over and hour for wings that were very poor looking. I've had nothing other than the boneless wings my entire life so I know how they normally look. This place doesn't honor the customer is always right policy most places do and could've cared less about us. The waitress felt so bad and did everything she could so we thank her! The manager didn't make anything right and never came back to check to see how it was the second go around. I highly don't recommend this location as the manager is terrible. My review is 0/5 stars for this visit."}
{"text":"I was more than impressed with this Applebees location! I placed an order to-go online. It was quick & easy. When I arrived, I was about 5 minutes early... the nice gal at the hostess stand promptly ran my payment & even offered me a water & some chips/salsa while I waited for my order.   I felt very comfortable & appreciated as a customer who only had to wait a short amount of time when it was my fault for arriving early. The order was perfectly accurate, the food still hot and very nicely organized in containers that kept the heat/quality of the food and lasted the transport home with no issues. It was a really great experience and a place I will be happy to return to give my business! Especially when they are offering better deals, portions & food quality than their competitors!"}
{"text":"I usually always come to this Applebee's late night & unfortunately this time we didn't get our usual server ( forgot her name) instead we got Tiffany. Just horrible service. She was rude & looked like she hated her life. We ordered our drinks & I got a Pepsi & when it came out it , it was flat. Once I let her know she let us know that she was aware that the soda was flat. Like why would you bother to bring me it to begin with. Then when we got our order it came out wrong & she made it seem like it was my fault because I had changed my side ? Like what the hell. These people need to step their game up . Don't recommend it go to the apple bees on Eastern & horizon !!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER....waited and waited to be greeted, took forever to get our payment was very rude towards our table. i don't recommended this location AT ALL. Lisa is the worst server i've ever had...i work in the restaurant business and I understand it's hard sometimes but there should be no reason for rude service towards paying guests."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon - December 2017 - for lunch with my husband. Found long blond hair in my salad (I'm a brunette). Called Manager over and told her. I refused to pay for my meal and walked out. I was ready to throw up! They made my husband pay for his half-eaten cheeseburger and fries and the drink I left on the table, even though his lunch was ruined also by what he saw and I was already in the car while he sat in restaurant alone waiting for the waiter to \"fix\" the bill. They took my special made salad and the appetizer off the bill only. Unacceptable!! I feel we should have been able to leave without paying anything! Horrible! Will NEVER go to this location again."}
{"text":"Service and food quality has fallen off at this location over the last couple of years.  Usually takes a long time to get your order and while chain food is usually at least consistent, we've been less than impressed and this used to be our go to for an affordable meal.  Willoughby location is doing it right."}
{"text":"The quality of food and service at this location has been excellent.  Accept it for what it is-bar food.  They have good salads & burgers.  2 for $20 and other deals make this a good budget place to eat.  Good selection keeps my kids happy too."}
{"text":"The food and bar drinks are consistently slow to reach the table at this location. Today it was 40 minutes for the food and it was dead... maybe 8 tables in entire restaurant.  I keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and have eaten here over 25 times since I live close by..but it is the same experience 90% of the time. Ordering appetizers through the table tablet seems to be the only way to get any food quickly.  I keep hoping the management makes changes but doesn't seem like it will happen."}
{"text":"We were greeted and sat down almost a minute in. Our server was great! Waited while we took forever to order. Happy hour drinks came out great! Food took a good minute but that's expected on a Friday night. Our steak was to perfection! Our server was very attentive! I would rather their steak then Marie Calenders or red lobsters and way more inexpensive!"}
{"text":"A decent place to go when it's not too busy. Service is average. Unfortunately I went during the holidays waited over 30 minutes to eat after being seated even though it was just me and my girl. Had to ask for knives twice to cut my steak. Other than that it's ok."}
{"text":"Shame on this location for serving a clearly intoxicated lady with 2 small children alcohol. When brought up to management that she was in no condition to keep drinking they blew it off saying she was a \"regular\" there and that she is still ok because she always comes in there with her kids. I will never come back to this location after witnessing this."}
{"text":"Terrible TERRIBLE service We were seated at this tiny table when they had a bunch of tables open then I asked for an appetizer never got that , I had to wait 20 mins each time I would ask for a drink refill we also waited over an hour for our food other people around us that were there after us got their food first I won't ever go back to this location"}
{"text":"If I were reviewing this on service alone, I would give 5 stars to our waiter.  He was overworked and had a very slow kitchen to deal with.  Yes, we were a party of 8 and another party of 8 was seated just before us.  You are a chain.  Isn't your kitchen prepared for big parties?  Our waiter was very patient and fantastic.  We had 4 hungry and tired kids.  It seemed like the food took forever to come out to the table.  I don't think we were complicated just had a lot of people.  Applebees please staff your restaurant appropriately, so our poor waiter can have the help he deserves."}
{"text":"I just went to eat here at 5pm and my and my girlfriend found a hair . And then they said it was going to be free . 1 hour later and no plate yet . I just left I was too mad ."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for my husband who is a very picky burger guy. He really enjoyed this one. Service was ok. Caesar salad was decent but nothing to write about. We will be back for his new found burger spot."}
{"text":"Fernando! Fernando! Fernando! Is the manager there at Applebee's a very friendly individual my wife and I had a great time and would come back solely on the fact that his customer service was impeccable. He kept his patience and helped my wife  find the perfect dish that she enjoyed."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was subpar. The 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese had too much jalape√±o for my taste and the pasta was otherwise bland, but the honey chicken tenders were delicious, albeit tiny. Order your steak a level of redness below your preference, it will continue to cook on its skillet after it is placed in front of you.   The staff were very attentive and friendly. This review is getting three stars because Applebee's just doesn't have the food to match its service."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the customer service is lacking like water in Arizona."}
{"text":"Ordered \"to go\" last night, got the two for twenty with a app and two standard burgers. The burgers were missing all of the toppings, we were given a burger patty and bun. I know they were busy, but for for the price it still would have been a much better deal heading to any drive-thru. I don't like leaving bad reviews but I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I feel like I want to like this restaurant because it has a convenient location and a menu that doesn't suggest complexity. Unfortunately, the food is just atrocious. The quality of everything they use is very poor, and it shows.   I'd advise you to save your money and just pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Appitezers came at the same time as the entree, the waitress told me I couldn't get a dish of lemon wedges with my water because the bar likes to mess with her. When the Asian salad came, I moved the veggie and found 2 small drops of the peanut salad dressing the size of a dime, the salad was completely dry. This is not the place to go if you want to enjoy a meal, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed the Soup and Salad All you can eat is gone for lunch.  They offered smallish servings of a soup and a salad and then you could re-order to try different types.  Decent food for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"My first journey out of the house, after moving to this state yesterday, landed me at Applebees. The only problem was that it was 11:20pm... And they close at midnight! I felt like such a d-bag, strolling in that late and so near to closing time. BUT the staff didn't seem to mind... Or at least they were pretty good at faking it! Our food and drinks were delivered in record time.   As a recently displaced Chicagoan I look forward to trying all the different foods in the area. I realize Applebees is a nation chain and will have the same food everywhere, but I will still come back here because they served my food without spitting in it even though it was so near closing time, and, I don't want to turn Yelp into a Craigslist 'missed connections' section, but my waitress Melissa (W?) was awfully cute :)"}
{"text":"For the third plus time (shame on us) we sat for over :10 minutes with no one even asking if we want water. Good thing more restaurants are opening up near here. This place blows."}
{"text":"Service was fabulous, professional, courteous w a smile, and beyond expectation for a casual chain restaurant.  I was impressed w my server, Stephanie, and especially w another one I observed (Chanel).  Chanel was extremely patient w a special needs gentleman.  She brought each of the dressings to taste.  She pointed to each one describing and writing what they were. She was consistently taking her time with him with his many questions and listening intently to his speech impediment to understand his needs.  She even kept him updated on his spending to keep within his spending budget and; yet, she still was able to take care of her other tables at the same time without slacking. Wow!  I ordered the unlimited soups & salads between 11-3 for $6.99 & my mom ordered the baby back ribs (nice smoky flavor she commented).  The grilled shrimp & spinach salad was very tasty served w hot (actually served nice & perfectly warm) bacon vinaigrette and Steph made sure I  was perfectly satisfied and full w refills of the great salad & soup of the day (broccoli & cheese).   Once again, pleasantly surprised with the quality & price for a casual dining experience. Thank you Steph, Chanel, and the hostess Yvonne."}
{"text":"hmmm, never knew that TGIF's was less expensive than Applebees as the quality of food is much nicer at TGIF's. yesterday me and my girls went to happy hour at Applebees in hopes of finding some good inexpensive appetizers to go with some tasty cocktails. our visit was on to a great start, as our server took care of us like we were in a 5 star restaurant. he was so awesome; he should have been in a tux and bow tie.   the cost for our drinks and food totaled $41.00 for 3 apps and 7 drinks which isn't bad for happy hour, but a few weeks ago we went to TGIF's for happy hour and ended up with 4 apps, and 2 rounds of specialty cocktails for 3 of us and the bill was under $30. all the appetizers were served at half mass, or at least half the portion served by TGIF's. the potato skins were so greasy not even the sour cream could make it go down smoothly. i did enjoy the spinach and artichoke dip, but the greasy chips were a little too much. kinda funny that the buffalo wings weren't greasy at all. my fav's were the spinach dip and the wings. the spinach dip was served in a kettle pan and there were big chunks of artichoke in it. the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking.  i'll give them another try, but next time it's only wings for me!"}
{"text":"Usually do not fill these out but this service was horrible. Waited almost full half an hour for curbside service. Had to go in twice and wait. No one came out to the car. Asked to speak to manager and waited for 5 minutes before I left. Never coming back here"}
{"text":"There service here was friendly and polite, but the food was just kind of poor.  The spinach/artichoke dip, for example, looked right but was quite bland in flavor.  Other items seem to be randomly either over-cooked or under - some real inconsistencies here."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying normally I enjoy my meal here.   But today my spouse and I decided to get the tavern steaks.   NO!! I don't know if they just bought a bunch of cheap steak and figure no one will know the difference or figure the folks who don't care will out number the ppl who does.   Well I do!   My taste buds were assaulted and I'm a big girl,  I don't play that,  I'm really mad.   If you don't care that your steak has so many ligaments that your sharp steak knife  protest with every saw motion then go ahead.   But if like me you like a nice delicious tender moist steak it wasn't mine."}
{"text":"Shelby and Mimi satisfy my appetite at Applebee's after hours lol.. professional and polite fun funny girls..n the chef is the bomb"}
{"text":"We went to this location's Apple bee's at night around 9:00 o'clock. A server Kelly was excellent! We loved her service! We ordered 2 for 20 and Spinach and artichoke dip was good. They got little machine on each table, she said we can't pay on the machine but soon we will be able to. :) It was our 2nd time, 1st time wasn't that good but seems like their service is getting better."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and quite frankly I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews. Tonight was definitely not their night. It took forever to get service and once our food came out I knew it would be cold. I just told the kids, they are having a bad night lets go.  Bathrooms are a mess.  Service was terrible and slow.  This place needs some serious help. It's a direct reflection of the management or lack there of.  The stereo was way too loud for a family type atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here because we had a gift certificate. Seated right away and our waitress was great.  Is not that I dislike Applebee's it just not somewhere I'd choose to go if i have an alternative. Food is average and I think overpriced for some stuff, especially the appetizers. Not much choice for the 2 for 20 or 2 for 25 deal that my husband and we coins choose. Not really much to say,  nothing stood out that would make me say wow or a dish that would make Applebee's a place to go for a repeated dish."}
{"text":"We went to this Applebee's twice last week, Sunday we did the two for 20 the chicken salad was fine, but my ribs tasted like Jerky. We checked the menu that was at the table and they advertised four different appetizers that were on special ALL day Tuesday and Thursday, so we thought we would give them a try on Thursday. We asked about the all day specials, waited 15 minutes for a server (should have walked out ). They claim to have never heard about that special. I told the manager which table that menu was at , he didn't bother to check and gave us that attitude that we did not know what we were talking about. The food this time was about what you would expect for $20 , nothing special. That will be our last visit to that Applebee's, we have many restaurants to choose from in this area, and do not need to dine at one with that attitude."}
{"text":"It is a good second choice kind of restaurant. You can never go wrong when going there. I cannot give it 5 stars as it never has anything that is different. It would be nice to have a menu that was specific to each location and have some items be the same for location to location."}
{"text":"I am not sure what has changed at this Applebee's, but it certainly isn't as good as it used to me. On Mother's Day we ordered take out. The Oriental Chicken Salads didn't come with any of their special dressing and we ordered boneless wings - but we got bone in ones instead.  My husband called to talk to the manager and he apologized and said he would send us something in the mail. One week later my husband called and the manager said he didn't have any stamps, but it was in the mail now. Three days later we received a coupon for two free entrees with a note to give them another chance. So we went in tonight and the salad was a little brown and it was translucent like it had been cooled too long. It just didn't have the same taste as the Oriental Chicken Salads from the past. My husband's Caesar Salad didn't look very good either. We ordered boneless wings right before their happy hour ended and we asked if we ordered them in time. He said yes, but them we were charged full price instead of half price. The steak my daughter ordered came with shrimp and cheese sauce on it. She didn't order it that way so we had to wait for them to make a new one as she doesn't like shrimp and she has a dairy allergy. They charged for the wrong, more expensive steak but took off 7 for \"quality\". My daughter liked the steak. It it was very small for the price. It did not look like 8 ounces. The service was extremely slow. It took 10 minutes just to get water after we sat down. The bill finally got straightened out. They took off for 2 free entrees and 7 for making us all wait for them to remake my daughter's steak.  The wings were still full price but we just wanted to leave so we just let it go. I am surprised the manager didn't come to speak to us. Especially after we showed the waiter the salad that we couldn't eat. The chicken was good that was on our salads. Also the French onion soup wasn't bad  and my husband and daughter said the wings were good.  The manager made the $7 \"quality\" adjustment for the steak but never came to talk to us. Not sure we will be back.  The management and wait staff could care less about their customers!!"}
{"text":"God this place sure has went down hill. Waited over and hour for food and all I ordered was unlimited soup and salad and a \"large\" lol house steak. Ive seen beef jerky out of a bag thats bigger then their large house steak. Lol"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Worst Applebees in town. Lots of servers, empty restaurant, waited 15 minutes for a server to take my order, nbody came, I left. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Great service but terrible food. We did the appetizer sampler; the chicken wings were great but our spinach dip was cold and nachos were extremely soggy."}
{"text":"Terrible service from bartender. Order a perfect margarita came out tasting like water sent it back he says it will taste the same have her order something else. Fool I can hear you sorry ass. Will be taking my business up the street. Damn I loved this place crystal or server was outstanding. Manager is an asshole too."}
{"text":"Close to home and 2 can dine for $20 bucks. Can't beat that. Good variety of food and great prices."}
{"text":"I ordered carside to go (service was great). When I got home, I cut into my chicken sandwich and discovered the chicken was not fully cooked. Ended up taking the chicken off the bun and making it a bacon and cheese sandwich. The fries were lukewarm at best, and soggy. This was my first visit to Applebee's in over a year, and will probably be my last visit."}
{"text":"Not good in the neighborhood at this place!  With the restaurant half empty , were told we had a 15 minute wait.  A large party that arrived after our group was seated, which was fine as they had reservations.  After waiting and waiting, asked manager Ron if we could at least sit at one the five or six empty tables available to wait and have a drink, but he was not seating anybody right now!  Our group could have at least sat, watched the Cavs game, and ordered some drinks.  PATHETIC.  Will not waste my time going there....they obviously did not want our business!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Robbie was our server.  Worst service I have had in a long time. Took 8 min to greet. 5 more min to come back to take drink order. Saw where this was going so put our food order in right away. Food took more than 30 min. We ordered soup salad and a sandwich. Server claimed that the cook was making fresh chicken for salad. Chicken was cold.. so that was a lie. Server told another table that was sitting without being greeted that he had been on a break. Total time in restaurant: 1 hour and 45 min. I hadn't been to this applebees in a long time and now I probably won't be back. As we were leaving...the table next to us was complaining about the same server.  Hmm."}
{"text":"A family in here was visibly harrassing a server and management did nothing to protect the employee. The family was causing a scene and even told the server to meet them outside to fight, while everyone near them had to hear the altercation.  The family should have been asked to leave, but instead it looks like they got their meal comped or taken care of... which is probably what they wanted. The manager should GROW SOME and back his employees, especially when they are being threatened.  The food took forever, had to ask for everything twice, came out hard and not enjoyable. 0/10 do NOT recommend.... unless you're looking for Jerry Springer type fighting at a family restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm don't eat a chains much but I'll stop in to my neighborhood Applebee's when I'm feeling it. This location in particular is great! The staff is attentive and they care about your experience. That Kind of service honestly makes the meal a little bit better. I usually get the 2 for 25$ with my buddy and it's honestly an amazing deal."}
{"text":"I been to many Applebee's before but this one takes the cake. The waiting is long!!!!! The place is dirty you can tell they don't do a deep cleaning enough. The server take forever to take your order and to fill up your drinks as well. Let's not forget the food it's gross. For example I order a cheese dip and it was cold. I swear they just poured it out of the bag and stuck it in the microwave and my chicken was very dry. I order a margarita and I'm pretty sure the mixture is from a bag that they add water to it. I only finished it because it had tequila. I had plenty of margaritas to taste the difference. Whatever happened to making them the old fashioned way??? I WILL NEVER EVER GO AGAIN IN MY LIFE. I'll make sure my friends know as well."}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Great customer service! Love the car side to go. My orders are always perfect! I will always choose applebees over our local Fridays!"}
{"text":"The best part of carside to go is when Camille brings out your food. Always pleasant and so extremely helpful!!! Whoever signs off on this girls checks needs to give her a raise! The foods not bad either :)"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in Applebee's right now. The service sucks my 2 for 25 was small portions. There was a man at the bar that was shows is ass the whole time and the staff was laughing never said anything. I didn't enjoy my because of this just sad!"}
{"text":"Five stars and ill tell you why. Many people underrate this place but if you don't like Applebee's style food then go somewhere else. Some people act like they are going to the Wynn when they walk into Applebee's and expect something unbelievable to eat. I work next door to this location and eat there three times a week I live the fiesta like chicken. It's as good if not better than any Applebee's I have Eaten at before. The molten chocolate cake it amazing also."}
{"text":"Great service and love the new menu choices. Quality of the food is very good for a chain restaurant. Just had the brunch burger and it was just OK. Won't get it again.  Sure doesn't look like the picture on the menu. Love the salads and the finger food choices. Build your appetizers is a great idea. We've ordered that couple of times.  Wish the \"wood fire grill\" had a little more smoked flavor on the steaks and burgers. We'll be back for the great service and menu variety."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food left a lot to be desired. I had the fish n chips. Outside very crispy but the inside was not cooked properly There was little flavor to the fish. Hubby had the Club sandwich...he said he has had better.  Margarita was ok.   Paid $1.99 for the worst game system ever.  I prefer  Chili's over Applebee's for food, drinks and games."}
{"text":"Tonight my gf order the 6 ounce steak medium well.. when it came (after a really long wait) it was over cooked and dry! Our server was nice enough and apologized. It was sent back. I was completely done with our appetizer and my meal before her new steak came back out! How did it take that long?!? If anything it should've been rushed through.. this time the steak was even DRIER then the first time and it looked as if it had been sitting there for a long time. Again we sent it back and time we asked to see the manager. He came over and apologized and offered to cook the steak himself. We agreed because my gf was hungry! Do you know it took EVEN longer to get the second steak then the first one?!? The one the MANAGER was supposed to be making himself? We were comped the steak meal but it still was absolutely insane. This is exactly why I usually don't go to chain restaurants. Our server was nice but this was awful!"}
{"text":"How could it take 30 mins to make spinach dip especially when it was slow? Wilted salad disgusting. I usually like going here for happy hour. This was my first bad experience! Hopefully they get more cooks wal know what their doing. And it's all about the management. Step it up!"}
{"text":"Horrible lunch service yesterday. SLLLOOOOOWWW. Took over 30 minutes to get our orders, three of which were wrong. No pico, they added pico. Add bacon? They forgot. Med Well burger, it was pink. The restaurant was dead so I have no idea what was going on in the back but Manager was uninterested. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Ok came here to strictly drink booze with Ellen F., we don't normally come here but we didn't want the cigarette stank on our clothes and it was either here or chili's for the moment. Cheesecake factory sounded a lil pricey and out of the way.   So we were the only ones in the joint as it had just opened. We walked right up to the bar and made our intentions very clear, 2 vodka sodas with a splash a lime please! The drinks came in a tall glass which I did like as it gives the illusion that there's more alcohol in the drink then intended.   Don't sit at the number 6 spot at the bar as the register is there and other bartender functions I suppose and feels like the bartender is hovering over you. Totally not their fault, should have moved. The drinks worked their magic and an hour and change later I left quite satisfied.   Oh ya the hostess doing her makeup and licking her hands wasn't cool, even if it's in the corner of the restaurant. Still saw it! Time and place home girl. And when wifey asked for water the inconvenienced look was no bueno either but hey its hump day so who knows.   Anyone else know a place on the west side (not the old one) where you can get a drink early that's not smoking, otherwise we will be coming back, not quite four stars I'd give it 3.5 if they allowed it. Solely based on the drinking experience not the food."}
{"text":"Way overpriced! That steak they gave me was not 8 oz. can't believe I paid 24 dollars for a meal worth half that much. Very disappointed. I forgot how much Applebee's was a disappointment. Maybe the company should re evaluate their approach. It could bring in more customers. Service kind of sucked too. Waited a hot minute to get my drink."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and kids and ordered the kids meal cheeseburgers with yogurt and strawberries one for a 3 year old and another for an 8 year old... the kids meals where so small it was about two oz of yogurt and about 1.5 strawberries and the burgers were about three bites we ended up having to stop and grab them each another dinner on the way home."}
{"text":"Very nice server named Tiffani T. Very polite and great customer service. Filled our water when needed. Food came quick and the 2 for 25 deal is awesome."}
{"text":"Terrible steak, small, fatty, and undercooked like crazy. Will not be eating here ever again. Waste of dinner. TGIFridays for me and all my friends and family for now on.  Or buy a steak at Walmart, it's better than this one! How do I give 1/2 a star? One star is too much"}
{"text":"Server was quick and food was delicious. Their 2 for 20 menu is great for saving money. They're open until 1am so is great for a midnight bite to eat plus their happy hour goes all night too!"}
{"text":"Went for the all in one burgers and did not dissapoint.  We we greeted by a friendly hostess and seated quickly and then it went downhill.  Our waitress was either new or Very incompetent.  No personality, took way long on everything, did not check back to refill drinks, did not ask if we wanted dessert, messed up the check.  I think she is in the wrong business, she tryed but must be overwhelmed by the job.  Now for the food, brunch burger is Good, would get again.  Bottomless fries were not since waitress did not come back until we were done."}
{"text":"Yesterday my Mom, took us to lunch at this Applebees  after shopping at Target in Boca Park, it was empty at lunchtime, about 1:30 or so on Labor day. My two small children were \"starving\" so I ordered their Meals First.. they came out with My mom's Steak, about 40 minutes later ! New waiter, he introduced himself as...... the food was O.K The wait was sooo Long. The place was empty. No Mgr in sight ! What Happened Applebee's? You used to be a kid friendly place ? It sucked."}
{"text":"Takeout is a mess at this location. In the past I've had to wait 30 minutes past the time they gave for pickup, and sit on hold for 15+ minutes only to find out it was because they didn't have anyone manning the phone. The last time they didn't include an entree we'd ordered, and a month later have failed to send a gift card to make up for the cost."}
{"text":"Food is good happy hour prices are bomb ...  wonton chicken tacos are bomb sweet and crunchy"}
{"text":"Sorry to leave a bad review but this place is gross! They took my food to the table behind me, left it there a good 5 min then realized what they did so they took it from the other guy and set it down in front of me.... I don't think so!!! I don't know what that other guy did t it while they left my food unattended with him for several min. Granted if they realized it was a mistake sooner (before they walked away) I would of had no problem eating it. Why would they expect me to eat that?! also the hostess that sat me wasn't very friendly I just didn't get good vibes. I hope I don't get sick from this place."}
{"text":"I like this place but their waitresses/waiters are rude sometimes. I was there with my family and the waiter kept pushing for us to buy drinks. Why? I have no idea why. I thought it was rude and so did my family."}
{"text":"I love this location the last time I was there out waiter was so nice and friendly. The food is really good and I love the atmosphere. I've tried a lot of their menu items and i really like everything but I think I like their drinks more than the food. Lol"}
{"text":"This is a location to pass on. At least till the get new kitchen and serving staff. Its graduation season and being a location near where many high school kids matriculated, large groups can happen a lot making the wait time for a seat substantial. But it is also leading to a holiday weekend and just summer we're friends come from out of town to visit. The issues is when your 'large' group has to hunt down the waitress to get a drink (forget about a refill), try to do food orders, get food with colds sides (guess I should be thank full the protein was warm) with out giving the opportunity to get it fixed, wait almost half an hour for the check that has been requested multiple times (yet runs to the table after the person just leaving saying their check, yeah we got it and need the change), and to top it off for dessert the ice cream was more melty  than standard making me think it might even be warmer than my sides. At least the brownie was still warm. For get a drink to wash it down with, that's what the cream soup is for. I guess."}
{"text":"Great service. Staff was nice and checked on often enough with out being over bearing. Good food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came in because I saw a commercial where they have the $12.99 deal for ribs and steak or you get to choose 2 item's and a couple of sides.  Well it was starting at $12.99 LOL I ended up doing the Monday burger and fries special for $7.99.   I ordered the whiskey bbq bacon burger and a Pepsi.  The burger was was topped off with onion string which I liked.  The burger overall was ok.  A little dry but yet oily.  The bbq sauce was a bit tangy.  It didn't have enough sauce so I asked for a side of sauce.  The fries was decent.   Our table was clean the bathroom was clean, and our server was great.   Overall experience was decent."}
{"text":"Very Clean Location with Exceptional Service provided by AMBER! We tried the 2 Entrees for $25 special. The Baby Backs were good quality, and the person that ordered the steak said its the best cut they have had in years!  Nice, Central Location with ample parking from the adjacent mall. Management seems to work hard in providing a great atmosphere for an Excellent staff."}
{"text":"I normally love Applebees but this experience was not so pleasant. I wanted something that was on the share menu like I always get. The waitress informs me there is a menu change and that is no longer on it. I was like well when did this go into effect, she says yesterday, lol. They wouldnt budge on letting me have it this one time since I was not aware of the change nor was the menu accurate. The hostess kept her distance after that. I will not be returning. They didnt even reach out to me after I asked who the manager was...He didnt even come out to speak to me."}
{"text":"I had the boneless chicken wings which are good any time. Also had the orential chicken salad one of my favorites.  Hubby had the chicken pasta penne dinner and a bonus was all the football on tv for him"}
{"text":"Came here tonight. Server was really friendly. I ordered bbq ribs and mash potatoes with greens. My food had good flavor but my ribs were COLD. Kinda disappointed. It's the second time that I come here and my food is cold"}
{"text":"Hostess seated us promptly. Lots of open tables which was a warm welcome considering all restaurants on Rockside have at least an hour wait. The service was ok. We weren't greeted by server promptly and it was a bit slow. Food was of Applebees quality and we had an overall average experience."}
{"text":"Ohhhh this Applebees. Well here goes...  My mom, sister, and myself came here for happy hour on a Monday. We sat at a high top in the bar which close to the door. We were sitting down for close to 10 minutes before the waitress even made an appearance. She asked what we wanted to drink.. My mom got a Long Island, I got a margarita, and my sister got sangria.   Fast forward 10 minutes, we see our drinks sitting at the bar just calling our name! Another few minutes go by and we see the waitress walking around not even checking for our drinks! Finally my mom gets up and has to ask the hostess to have our waitress please bring our drinks that have been sitting up there for 15+ minutes.  She finally brings the drinks over.. And she brings my mom a margarita instead of her Long Island. Not a big deal, these things happen. But no, the waitress decided to argue with us that my mom said she wanted a margarita... Well then.  She brings the correct drink back.. We don't see her for another 10/15 mins and we are starving!   Not once did she smile or make small talk. This Applebees is just sad. We won't be back, which is Unfortunate because my sister lives a mile away!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  manager was always on the floor greet guest,  Tiffany sever was in a good mood cheerful, and was checking on was every 6 mins."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would..I usually don't leave a review but the food taste worst than a damn box.  If you want to drink great..eating is a whole nother story. .tuck!!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised people eat here and downright shocked that people order food to go. Applebees is gross. I wait for my husband to pick me up at the one at Rural and Broadway after work and the place is one step up from a total dive. The staff is friendly which is the only good thing about the place."}
{"text":"Typical Applebee's:   The waiter is pissed to be at work. The food is average. The food arrival time is average.  The cost is average.  TV's are everywhere with various sports events on.  I don't show up here by choice, it's always someone else's half-hearted idea. If you are playing it safe, this is it. If you want something to remember or an exciting time, this is not the place."}
{"text":"My family used to go to Applebee's as a dinner so I've been to many different ones. This was by far the worst one. When me and my guest arrived there was hardly any business.  We ordered our food and drink fairly quickly because of the 2 for $25 deal they offered. When our food came out they didn't bring my guests toast. When we asked for it, it began to get busy and then we were completely ignored. Not only did we have to ask several times to get our toast and check, but we received them together after I had already finished my food and my guest was almost finished. I will not return."}
{"text":"Ate a BLT here for lunch which gave me severe food poisoning...avoid. On the flip side the staff is very nice but food quality seems to get worse everytime I go."}
{"text":"Janice was our waitress today and she's absolutely awesome. Very accommodating , friendly and funny ! excellent customer service, I'd definitely recommend to family and friends. I tried the artichoke & spinach dip & we got the chicken pasta. Quick, efficient , sanitary & fast service."}
{"text":"This place was like walking into the arctic.  It was so cold where we were sitting that as soon as the food was brought out it was cold.  They turned the air up but that was about a 10 minute reprieve. Can't say we'll be back..."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. First off we had one of the best servers in that restaurant his name was Daniel and he was so bubbly and willing to help anyway that he could. Great job makes me want to continue to have him as our server. Now the downfall the food has way I mean way to much sauce for anyone's liking easy on the sauce there. Other then that very very pleased."}
{"text":"I would give it less stars if possible. Had to wait 10 min. For waitress to come take our drink order, then she took our food order at the same time. Next I me we saw her she brought the drinks and the food at the same time 20 min. later. Food was cold, French fries (their speciality as they are suppose to be bottomless) were like rubber, chicken strips were over cooked. Would have complained but never saw manager. After we finished had to wait 20 minutes for waitress to come back so we could ask for ticket. Wife and daughter never got a refill because of no waitress. Let's not talk about the table if kids they sat us next to when there were many other not being used. Table were not cleaned off. I have eaten here several times and it has always been like this. Do not think I will ever go back again. DO NOT GO HERE. Go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was good.  There would have been more if there was any type of service. Stopped in yesterday for lunch, the restaurant was less than 1/2 full and we were there at peak lunchtime. Our server introduced herself and got our drinks. She later returned to get our order. We waited for about 15 minutes and one of our entrees came out by another server. 5 minutes later the second entr√©e came out from yet another server... 5 to 7 minutes after that the 3rd entr√©e came out delivered by I believe the manager, and the entr√©e was wrong. How two salads and a soup had to come out at 3 different times is unacceptable. If you come in together to eat , you should be able to eat at the same time. Oh and the electronic order/pay pad is large and annoying on the table and back and forth with the server."}
{"text":"It's certainly not the best food, but it is close to our house, usually prompt, and pretty cheap with the 2 for $20 and kids eat free. So, it was an OK choice on occasional nights when we didn't feel like cooking or just wanted a change of scenery.  That is, until last night. After first waiting for 15 minutes for any wait staff to appear, then waiting an additional several minutes for our waters to arrive (not to mention the additional 10 minutes for the single beer to brought out), then waiting for quite some time for our meals to arrive, we discovered that somehow 1 order wasn't placed. At this point it was a full hour from when we were seated. I waited an additional 10-15 minutes for my salad to arrive. The manager stopped by to offer chips and salsa, but we'd already had an app with the 2 for $20, so we declined.  At this point, the kids were tired and restless, and ready to head home. I packed my salad in a to go box and asked for the check. They offered a 10% discount, which amounted to less than $3 on the total bill. Unfortunately, at this point we discovered that the restaurant had stopped the kids eat free plan as well.   So, all told, the meal took twice as long as we planned, with a lot more hassle than necessary, and we spent more than the quality of food warranted, and certainly more than the overall experience warranted.  Since the primary reasons we chose Applebee's on nights like last night were the convenience and relative cheap cost, we won't bother going back in the future."}
{"text":"Applebee's was great the first few months it was open.  This time was not so good.  Soup had to reheated in microwave.  Pretzel appetizers looked like they were from last week - hard at the ends and all wrinkled.  Table beside us had same issue.  Kids ordered milkshakes - they tasted like milk in shaved ice.  They were so terrible the kids didn't even take a second sip.  Music was so loud you couldn't hold a conversation - had to ask twice to have it lowered even then it was to loud for 5pm.  Hoping our next visit will be better."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I was sad to see you guys didn't make the regular chicken quesadilla anymore. I know you have the smaller version in appetizers so I got that since its basically the same just smaller. It was so good and hit the spot in my tummy! YUM. The water was really good and filtered. My only concern is that the place is always packed and you guys need a bigger place!"}
{"text":"It's cheap good food.  Not outstanding but you get what you pay for so you can't really complain.  And lets face it, you're not really going there for the atmosphere or some top notch dish, you just want a variety decent food at a good price.  Sure it's a chain, who cares? Sorry to all those anti-chain people, let me guess, you're drinking microbrew right now?  Get over it you yuppie!"}
{"text":"Great Price's! Fun people! The staff is usually very and honest. If you ask them what is good they will tell you they let you know about specials. Cristi is a great bar tender she will make you laugh she is very attentive. It's a fun place to go most of the time people are friendly. This is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Standard Applebees's sit down restaurant  and bar. Hostess didn't know any menu items really at all. Our server wasn't very talkative but kept our glasses full. Seat was freshly wiped when we were seated. No knives til we asked. Could probably have just used their digital system and left but weren't really informed of that until the very end. We are so use to a paper check."}
{"text":"Last week my family and I went out to dinner and had the worst experience. My child was served an expired milk (expired a month ago). When I brought it to the management's attention they reacted totally inappropriately and offered no apology, except to \"thank\" me. Meanwhile the waitress tried to justify the expired milk saying \"good thing she didn't gag when she took a drink\" or \"you know it didn't smell bad so it wasn't rotten\". Both statements being completely irrelevant seeing as it expired may 29th! Yet they continued to thank me and my husband and assured us \"the other milks were thrown out\". Now I work in food service and there are laws and regulations in place to keep something like this from happening. Laws and regulations this Applebee's just happens to ignore.  Needless to say be careful here."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant so I figured it would be generic food, not super delicious, but not horrible food. The customer service was good and service seemed to be pretty fast. The only thing that didn't really seem to hit the nail on the head, so to speak, was the food itself.  They're blue cheese wedge salad is not appetizing at all. The lettuce was not rinsed off all the way so it had sort of a gritty texture underneath the abundance of blue cheese dressing they slathered on top of it. The dressing itself was not high quality. If you were to do a blind taste test, I would not be able to tell this dressing from a watered down ranch. The only reason they have 2 stars is because they're baked potatoes are to die for! They are cooked perfectly and they have the right amount of toppings, but then I think \"how hard can it be to cook a potato?\".   The boneless wings also have some weird sprinkles of 'something' on them and they're dipping sauces taste like they got all of them out of a cheap bottle @ a really cheap market. ew.   Choose Chili's instead if you're looking for something relatively cheap."}
{"text":"Went last night, the restaurant was clean and we got right in. The waiter took our drink order and our order timely but brought the wrong soup for both my daughter and I..he took my soup bowl but not my daughters so we had to ask to have hers traded which seemed to irritate the server. Our entrees looked good but was lukewarm and when our server refilled our tea it was raspberry not regular like we ordered. We ended up just leaving even though we weren't finished, both of the tables around us also had complaints and we felt uncomfortable at that point."}
{"text":"I'm all about eating local, supporting small business and all that... I never thought I could become a fan of such a corporatey chain as Applebee's... but it truly is the staff that makes the place.  Everybody here is super friendly. Robert is a fantastic bartender, and hardly ever short on ideas for new drinks. On top of all that, they've got karaoke on Tuesday nights that is a blast! Yes, you read that right. Karaoke at Applebee's. Crazy, I know, but lots of fun regardless.  Oh yeah and their shredded pork wonton tacos... YUM!"}
{"text":"Awful. My girlfriend and I went to this Applebees last night because we haven't been to one in YEARS, and now I remember why. We got the 2 for $25 with an app and the appetizer was spinach and artichoke dip, the dip tasted like it was purely microwaved. She got chicken tenders with pasta, and the bacon and cheese flavor was artificial crap. I got sirloin with fries and mixed vegetables. IT CLEARLY states you get two sides with this meal and I was charged for one side. The mixed vegetables were huge but somehow they all tasted the same ??? My sirloin was undercooked and top it all off my girlfriend and I and Now sick as dogs today mmmmmm I WONDER WHY! Service was quick but it was only because the staff wanted to close up earlier. If you don't mind stuffing crap down your gullet and paying a decent amount for it, look no further!!!"}
{"text":"They have these ridiculous I pad things at the tables that your kids can inadvertently add charges to your bill by pulling up games. Not to mention we go to dinner for family time not video game time. Whoever thought this idea up was a total moron."}
{"text":"We just finished eating here. The food was just fine but the service was so sad. Our waiter was pleasant enough but could not seem to handle more than one table at a time. My son wanted a refill of his soda and practically had to trip another waitress to ask her to get him a soda. Thank god we were able to pay at the table or we might still be there waiting for our check."}
{"text":"Julia is really is good. Happy hour is really good. Wings at discounted rate.   Be back for sure"}
{"text":"Okay seriously AZ? This Applebee's is EMBARRASSING! The service! The food! My drink! Servers and bartenders are extremely unprofessional. They RUIN the Applebee's name! Can't wait till Chilis across the street opens! Hopefully they have better employees who take pride in their work and service! Shame on you Applebee's on 75th Ave!"}
{"text":"Frequent lunch spot, service is normally good."}
{"text":"Don't even bother going here, every time I go in service is terrible there commute no one in the restaurants and the service will be so slow! Not only is the service bad but the food taste very commercialized"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this Applebee's location I'm treated like precious cargo.   Really.   I've never had a waiter/waitress here that didn't exemplify utmost amazingness. This time I was waited on by an Italian Irish fellow named Ryan. And I must say Ryan was the shit.  But why three stars? Well it is a restaurant. And a crucial part of any restaurant is food. Applebee's food sucks. Everytime I go, no matter the location, the food sucks.   And the drinks...the detail that means the most to me...suck. I had two fishbowls. 2 fishbowls!!! I should have been woozy, dizzy, happy...anything to show I had consumed alcohol, but all I felt was the need to drink water to erase some of the super sugary taste out of my mouth.  I mean really Applebee's! Club bees! Mistah Apple!   You disappoint me."}
{"text":"I always receive good service here, went yesterday around lunch time and was seated promptly.  Food came out in a very decent time frame.  2 entrees and an appetizer for only $20 YOU CAN  NOT BEAT IT!  And the food was excellent  Also, there is karaoke until around 2am, I'm not sure exactly what nights besides Friday's and Saturdays, but it's always entertaining!  Check the location out for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place needs an overhaul and some help.  My friends like to do happy hour and this place is by their work. They used to offer mudslides, sangria and other amazing drinks but now they have taken all that away. It's gotten to the point that there is pretty much nothing on happy hour anymore. I think they offered a margarita, two wines and a few straight liquors.   The food is super salty and there is almost no flavor to it. I usually get an artichoke dip if that. Though recently they added pretzel rolls with beer cheese and that is actually pretty good. Though, how could you screw up cheese?!   Last time we went, there was no hostess. My friend waited a solid five minutes before we asked a bartender for help. The only saving grace of this place is the wait staff. Most of them have a good sense of humor and make sure you are set. Our waiter made out night fun but everything else was pretty mediocre at best.  Bring back the mudslides to happy hour!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, delightful experience. My husband and I sat at the bar to watch the USA soccer game. The bartender was inviting and knowledgable. Our drinks never went empty. The appetizers came out promptly as well as our meal. Most chain restaurants I expect a wait for our meals; regardless of the restaurant being packed, we got our meals within 20 minutes of being seated. We even had time for dessert."}
{"text":"I'm adding 2 stars back to a total of 3. Tonight, I had the small steak and baked potato and it was wonderful. I'll be back again as they are really trying here. Every restaurant has a bad spell and I overlook that.  Upward and onward!"}
{"text":"Ordered Nachos wasn't pleased with my order!!! This nacho cost $10 and there was nothing on there!! Bar tender was nice. But overall pretty displeased!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this location 5 stars but it's  not even worth 1.  It was not that busy so the wait time couldn't  be that long  right? Wrong. i was very patient for 45 minutes but when the family that came  on the 46th minute sat down and got their food before my table did, i walked out and no one even noticed.  I WILL NOT EVER VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN. Big ."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the half-price apps great deal. Loved the wings and tacos. Server was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff, fast service! But was a little disappointed I had to send my order back and the manager herself made it again for me and it was absolutely delicious it's posted on my pics."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat out as I am fairly health conscious and most restaurants use horrible quality ingredients and too much salt buuuut I was feeling lazy and I'll be gone for a few days so I didn't want to go far or have food in my fridge going bad. I ordered food online from the Applebee's a few blocks away. I only wanted fish for some reason and didn't have a taste for anything else. The only fish they showed was blackened tilapia and salmon. I chose the tilapia because chain restaurants never get salmon correct. You can't screw up blacked tilapia right? I also added some garlic mashed potatoes with butter, sour cream and cheese. I know, not very healthy. It was about 6:50 when I ordered and said my food would be ready by 7:09. I left immediately and got there just before 7. I didn't wait long when 2 girls came out with my check. Thankfully I optioned to pay cash and not credit. I gave her a $20 and she said she would be back with my change. She was back shortly and said my food was still cooking and it would be a few minutes. I said OK. I have a toddler so I was trying to entertain him while we waited. A few minutes later she came back with a menu to tell me that they didn't have tilapia. Not that they ran out but that they just no longer had it on the menu. She asked if I wanted anything else. No apologies, no offer of a free item, nothing. Just handed me the menu and stood quietly while I flipped through. I said I didn't want anything else, that I specifically wanted the tilapia and handed her the menu back. She just look dumbfounded. The girl behind her asked if I still wanted the mashed potatoes and I said I guess so because they were for my son. And I said, \"So my food wasn't even cooking when you said it was.\" She said no and that she went into the kitchen to ask if the tilapia was done and they said they don't do tilapia anymore. Still no apology or offer of compensation. They left and I waited for about 10 minutes for her to bring my change back. I had left a tip over 20% when I paid initially but she did not give that back. I told her anyways to keep the tip because I'd been a waitress before and I know how much the job sucks. But to assume after all the waiting for nothing but a small side of mashed potatoes she would just keep the tip, offer no apology and barely speak to me? Seriously? I chalk it up to her first day of training for her first job ever. She couldn't have been over 18 years old. By the way, the mashed potatoes were disgusting, I didn't get sour cream and as I stirred them I noticed remnants of green onion I never asked for. Ended up driving thru McDonalds. Yuck. Serves me right for trying a chain restaurant again."}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was awful.  It was bland and stale for one dish and too spicy for the other.  When I sent them back, the waitress gave me no problems and immediately took it off the bill."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the half soup an sandwich combo. It was horrible ! The bread from the sandwich was like dipped in butter it was soggy. The tomato basil soup was so thick, it was like mash potatoes. Never again I'll I stop there. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today was seated quickly the waitress was polite & professional the service was excellent & also fast the food was very good will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Today I feel unamerican.  Freedom, liberty, the right to speak and choose without punishment is one of the most sacred treasures we have as Americans. Out of all the good food, restaurants, and entertainment choices given, Applebee's on N prospect was chosen. To think I have free will and I picked Applebee's?!   Everyone on staff could be potentially the stupidest people we have in America. The manager hired them so that goes without saying. Not one item was correct that we ordered, except the drinks, in which half were water. The food looked like it was picked out of the dumpster and put on a plate from Walmart. The food tasted worse than it looked. The manager apologized and charged us for the drinks only, so at least that almost made up for the rest of the night.   The rest of my night, miserable. I, and another member of the party, have had stomach pains and have been throwing up from eating their food. Conspiracies arise as to what happened back in that Applebee's kitchen Saturday evening, but only my stomach has the facts. As I turn and hug the toilet for life, the founding fathers are turning over in their graves disgusted. Disgusted in the fact that they gave us independence and freedom, and I chose Applebee's.   Please execute your right, independence, and freedom. Do not choose Applebee's. god bless."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever gotten when going to Applebee's. Alfredo was my server and he was amazing!! He constantly checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Great attitude, wonderful smile. All servers need to be like this. Give this man a raise!"}
{"text":"So they used to have strawberry lemonade on their menu. If you go here and order a strawberry lemonade or a quencher lemonade the only difference is one has some canned strawberries added and cost two dollars more without refills. Asked for the manager and he clearly admitted that the picture in the menu is very misleading. The menu shows what looks like a premium drink and what we got was from the fountain. Applebee's in general is declining in quality and atmosphere but this location has been particularly hit hard. Service is bad and waiters and waitresses are a mess. The food here tastes like they just pour salt on everything way too much. You shouldn't have to Yelp Applebee's but I found it very comical that the menu and what you actually get has such a discrepancy."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely horrible experience at this location and have been to this location before and that time it was great but I brought my family here again and we were told they were behind and it would be a 30 minute wait just for the food which was fine no rush we were seated and our nice waiter came to get out drink order and food order when our food came to the table everything was very good but we had no refills the entire hour to the point I was going to buy drinks from a gas station and come back we paged our waiter multiple times he never came we even asked the front desk employee to get him for us but he never came he decided to stand and Talk with a group of young guys and got them multiple refills of alcohol I decided to tell the front desk employee for boxes to go because the waiter couldn't do his job $70 for horrible service we would have been better off staying home for dinner I will never be back to this location made me feel like me and my family weren't welcome in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Slow slow and slower! This place took FOREVER to bring appetizers and the main course! Food was pretty good wonton tacos are thee single best  app on the menu... Our server was the sweeter then a sonic cheesecake milkshake and was very knowledgeable but the overall experience was a draggggg."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I enjoyed the meals both times. We also got dessert both times and they were both delicious. Plus our waiter Cody was a delight both times. Good job Applebee's!!!  Sorry I Couldn't get a picture of the dessert before hand my boyfriend didn't give me a chance."}
{"text":"So we went to this Applebee's for the first time in a long time. The waiter was great. That's the only good thing. The food was ok. We saw 2 infants in the bar area and 4 toddlers at 10:30 pm. Maybe some people are ok with this but can't believe they allow kids in the bar area. Then there was the Karaoke...........at Applebee's?  The only ones singing were the Karaoke guy and the employees. Our waiter even said he didn't like it! Just when I thought the Karaoke was the worst part of our evening. Oh no, we go out to our car and their was a piece of crap Mustang parked next to us and two people were in it having sex in it! Yes, I said sex! Needless to say we will not be going back to Applebee's period."}
{"text":"This is the 7th time coming here n it is the 7th time theyve done me wrong.. This time was the ultimate worst im so over this location... The food sucks they got my order wrong n shit is under cooked..... Just unhappy all together .."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a huge smile, our drinks and order was taken right away, the food was great and service was fast, first time at this location definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ignored the no mushrooms on hubbies chicken and dumped a shaker worth of pepper on my steak to cover up the gristle?? Nice waitress... ir it would be one star"}
{"text":"Dinner review... terrible lighting. .. over dressed salad... drunk spewing profanity at the bar... will not be back again after dark... never had bad meal on weekend at lunch."}
{"text":"Ok, went here for dinner and found the service to be much improved! The food was good as well. So it's worth another visit if you've been avoiding the place."}
{"text":"One star lost for making are perfect margaritas taste different then usual. Nothing worse then not seeing your normal bartender and then a simple signature franchise drink taste so wrong . One more star for no service at table. We waited 15 min for check after they cleared table and in middle of shift change 4pm and we went unnoticed from workers . Korean wontons and happy hr items were always a gem for the $$$.."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a low review but.....whatever chef was in today was the best! I'm picky when it comes to my steak and normally other Applebee's are not too good at making a perfect juicy steak but let me tell you this chef was on point."}
{"text":"Made the order online, the process is easy and fast, only wished that there were more menu options. Picking up the food at the restaurant was fast. The food tasted great, overall a very good experience for mothers day."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Applebees been here numerous times over the past 10 years I own a business a couple blocks down the way and come here on my lunch break a few times a week and also bring my customers for lunch while they wait and they are also completely satisfied definitely recommend this Applebees"}
{"text":"Sarah is our server/waitress tonight ! She's so nice & makes us feel welcomed food is awesome prices are great ! Clean and comfy love it (:"}
{"text":"Well all I can say is the 3 times a year I go to Applebee's I have been satisfied with my meal and the service is decent as well .yesterday I sat in the bar and had the nachos as I said I thought they were good and the waitperson was polite and  Effeciant"}
{"text":"It's applebees what can you expect. The server had too many tables, the drinks were slow due to the bartender serving too many guests. I sort of expect it though. That's why I normally sit at the bar and will from now on. The Happy hour is nice though."}
{"text":"We got seated quickly, waiter started off bringing the wrong drink for my son. VICTOR is the waiters name. He took our order so quickly but we wanted an appetizer since is was happy hour. But he took over 20 mins to come back and said it was past happy hour time. My sons food has refills on the fries and he told us it doesnt but menu says it does. Then he said is 99 cents and should of told him from the beginning  of the order. I will never eat here again if my server is VICTOR. This man needs to be fired. The ladys next to us complained to the Manager about him. Wow fire VICTOR"}
{"text":"Not the best neighborhood... Lock your cars before going into Applebee's.... The waitresses smoke a lot... And they're gone for awhile.. Took a long time to get our bills.  I liked their fried green beans at just $4. It's a really awesome appetizer... They're crispy but slightly drenched in oil but the ranch dressing with the green beans went well!   I usually just get appetizers since I get there so late, they're half off.. Cheese sticks with marinara sauce, grilled chicken wantons and chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"Went there for some boneless wings with friends and our server MARGARET was the absolute WORST. She had the ugliest personality and and acted like she hated us. We got waters and asked for lemon but never got them. I finished my water before our food got there and never received a refill. I ordered boneless wings and when they came they were HORRIBLE. They were just cut up chicken and were not even breaded completely. I didn't even want to bother asking for a remake because we would have probably been there all night. Since I never got a refill I ate my meal without water. How ridiculous is that?? Our server was totally avoiding us. I work at a restaurant and I understand that there are off days but this was absolutely horrible. Worst service ever. If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"I will never come here ever ever ever again . We waited for 2 hours before getting asked for drinks and they definitely don't know anything about customer service . They need to get retrained all over again . The waitress was very disrespectful and the manager acts like she could care less . GET YOUR STORE IN ORDER & they have attitudes because we asked for what we WANT & NEED . The customer is always first like get it together . Never again , they don't care what they do nor care bout customers. WORST APPLEBEES IN CHARLOTTE!!!!"}
{"text":"So I came here today because I had a coupon to get a couple dollars off of their 6 oz steak meal. The waitresses were pretty cool up until they found out that I had a coupon and then their demeanor changed entirely. It was very quiet when I went and the noise level was too a minimum so that was nice. The service was prompt but the food was pretty bad and it will keep me from ever coming here again. So after waiting for about 15-20 minutes my food finally arrived. First off the steak was not even close to a 6 oz steak at all this thing was more on par with a 2 oz steak it was so tiny. I mean a 6 oz isn't huge at all about fist size but this was extraordinarily small. The steak was also mostly fat and gristle so the only real steak you got was about 4-5 small bites.  The steak had no real flavor so using the A1 was a requirement and it was just not a very good experience. It was a decent and quiet venue with okay and prompt service but I would think twice before using a coupon here. I had to have gotten the worst or at least second worst cut of meat they had available and they lost a customer. Only reason I give this place 3 stars and not 1 is because it was quiet and I was seated and served immediately."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER HAD!! We had 2 separate waiters and they both sucked! Attitudes were terrible. They took forever with our orders. Ugh. Very dissatisfied with this location!"}
{"text":"not starting off good.......they are not busy, several tables empty....5 employees sitting at a table in the bar...apparently not their job to seat a party of two.....no one else in the lobby, just my husband  and i.....6 minutes for some to walk over and acknowledge us.  finally, got a table....seated at 5:02.....order taken at 5:14.   but much to our dismay, the couple next to us had already sent both of their steaks back...twice.   then finally left (mind you, this was just in the 12 minutes that we had been seated).  getting concerned and hangry.....  we order  mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers and a burger....fingers crossed   nothing earth shattering, but nothing consistent.  going to a chain restaurant,  you expect a certain level of consistency...not here.  fries came luke warm at best, burger leaning more toward medium rare than the requested medium, chicken fingers were more the size of nuggets.  our server,  the poor guy,  was getting crap left and right....and his \"manager\" did not much than offer in support other than attitude to customers who complained.  I would highly rethink your decision to visit this Applebee's, sorry to say"}
{"text":"We were immediately seated and warmly greeted by Shane, our server.   He informed us of the late night appetizers, which were 50% off, what a deal.  The Chicken Quesadillas were very good, quite delicious."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting here ( Arizona Business Connection) with Bob from Minute man cleaners & Jens The handyman,  I think it it was a good choice for the meeting, I had the Fiesta chicken chopped salad also a good choice but the other guys sandwiches looked better.  Over all a great meeting, good service and good food."}
{"text":"Since we can't get Caso Dip any more we got chips & salsa. I've had MUCH  better salsa out of plastic jars. Yuck. The green was better but both were extremely gringo mild.   The meals, were ok. But we miss a lot of the menu items we used to love. It's close to home & not crowded anymore so sometimes its a place for a meal &  quick beer on Saturday night when you can't get a seat at the good places."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE IF YOURE UNDER 50.   My party and I ate here for the 2 for twenty deal. We noticed how there were so many senior citizens at the place. All but my party and another. But then we realized why. Seems Applebee's workers only care for the elderly and do not waste their time on anything else.   Our waiter seemed nice at first but then after he gave us our drinks he kind of got distracted by other customers. To the older people he helped, he was extremely attentive and polite but whenever he came back to our table he didn't seem to give a DAMN.   Never refilled our waters. Took 40 mins until our food arrived because he didn't take our order until 20 mins in...He passed by our table numerous times, and even asked us if the food was alright but didn't notice our drinks getting less and less. My friend started to suck on her straw so loud cause there was nothing left, and it finally caught his attention.   There was also an older couple who came in during the time our waiter took our order. Also taken care of by the same waiter, and their food came before us.. My friend ordered a salad for goodness sakes and hers came out last!   Even the manager who was on the floor today greeted and mingled with people over the age of 45... He talked to everyone on our side of the restaurant except my group and the other group who didn't qualify for being a senior citizen... Food was bland but I don't have high hopes when coming into a chained restaurant like that anyway. But seriously... I understand you should respect your elders.. However we are paying customers who deserve to be treated equally."}
{"text":"Horrible service.......we told the server we were going to a movie at the theater next door. The other couple ordered a drink with our dinner as did I had to ask three different times for my drink and two separate servers. The other couple had there drink right away. The server brought My whiskey cocktail with the bill. I ordered one drink and had to down it to make it to the movie on time.  If I wasn't in a hurry I would have made them take it back and remove it from the charge but based on how slow it took to get I didnt want to be anymore late for my movie. Horrible since there were only 3 tables in My section filled.  My bill was 46.50 and I only tipped enough to make it an even 50 dollar. And I felt that was a little much. Really disappointed since we have gone there in the past and it seems to be going down hill."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way from home to the airport.  We gave ourselves about an hour to eat and it took all of that.   Walking in, the carpet wad stained and dirty. Rolled up silverware was strewn all over the hostess station making entry seem like it was thru a backroom and the entire place smelled foul.  Three staff were standing at the entrance. Two females didn't even look up but the male greeted us, but didn't offer to seat us. I mentioned \"We'd like a table for four and not a booth if there is someone that works here that's no too busy.\" My 86 year old mother was with us walking with her cane. The hostess I being totally oblivious leads us the stairs.  She asked \"Are you ok?\" Mom replied \"I can walk the distance just not up stairs.\" Again,  oblivious. Other tables had food and trash on the floor.  We were given menus promptly and greeted by our waitress. I stressed our tight timing and she said \"Oh you'll be fine.\"  She took beverage orders and returned when we summoned to take orders.   Food came out after quite a wait. The place was only half full so we wondered what the delay was, since we ordered simply, being on a tight timeline. The food was marginal at best. The wife's burger came out black with wilted lettuce and luke warm fries. Had it not been that we were in a hurry,  it would have been sent back.  No condiments,  just catsup on the table.  Halfway thru the burger the server returns asking if we wanted anything else. \"Mustard would have been nice\" was my wife's reply \"But you disappeared.\" My quesadilla tasted fine but in less than 30 minutes I got sick barely making it to the airport restroom. A change of clothes was a necessity.  The house salad was fine.  This is the closest eatery to our home and now I remember why we rarely eat here. Maybe when its dark and drink are cheap would be a better time to come."}
{"text":"Good food and service but you cannot get a shot and a beer at the same time! Un- American to say the least. Attorneys are killing us for their gain."}
{"text":"From 8/26/15  Came here for a late lunch.   When we walked in the place was practically empty, which was perfectly fine; that only means our food would come out faster haha. Now I have not been to an Applebees in quite some time, and from the looks of it, their game has been stepped up a notch, menu-wise.  I ordered the \"Build your own Sampler,\" you can pick any two for $9.50 or pick 3 for $12.50. I decided to get the \"Pick two,\" and ordered the Pot Stickers, and French Onion Soup. It was pretty good and satisfying.   Now that I see that Applebee's has improved I will have no problem going in for lunch at some other point and time."}
{"text":"I would give my experience ZERO stars. Went in a couple days ago for dinner... Took about 15 minutes for our server to say a word to us..... Took our drink and dinner order..... Ordered steak with a baked potato and green beans.... Also a side house salad no tomato...   Salad comes out WITH tomatoes all over it and no salad dressing......  About 20 minutes later it dinner comes out..... Steak looked great, green beans  looked good and the baked potato....... Was a plain ass potato.... No butter, no sour cream NOTHING..... When server asked if we needed anything else- responding with.. YES butter and sour cream- the look on her face as if I said her face looked like asshole was beyond surprising..... I didn't know asking for what should have already been on the baked potato was  no no."}
{"text":"I guess this location has their own chart on how to cook steak that's different from the rest of the world. Wasted a whole hour for them to give me a medium  steak that's well done but they claim medium has no pink. So sent it back to get a steak that has pink and they give me rare. Never coming back to this location or any applebee's at that."}
{"text":"I'm about as not fond of this Applebee's as I can be.   Let's start with car side to go. Three quarters of the time, I end up going in to get my food because no one comes out. And this isn't counting the times when they've been slammed, or shortstaffed, and have told me to come in when I placed my order.  If you offer a service, it should work. Not at this location.  The food has always been hit or miss, but with more misses. Frequently undercooked food, especially with car side orders. Last time, I cut up my fiesta lime chicken to find 1/3 of it still raw.    The service (for dine in) is always fine, and it's clean. Still, I avoid this location due to bad experiences."}
{"text":"Going to Applebee's after work for happy hour seemed like a good decision. I remember loving the Orlando location by my former university. I came here with the intentions of a 1 to 2 hour meal with a few co-workers. However, this turned into closer to a 3 hour experience due to slow service. I got the boneless hot wings and the wanton chicken tacos. I am pretty sure the hot wings were straight from a freezer because of the texture of the breading. The quality of the food I had from the happy hour menu was not too great, and thankfully I only paid happy hour prices. My happy hour margarita was just okay. The worst part was the service. The waiter stopped by our table only occasionally and walked off a few different times before taking the entire party's order.        At the end, when it came time for me to cash out, the waiter brought our checks out with the orders not separated right. This wouldn't be a problem, if the following did not occur. The waiter went to go make the needed corrections, but then she comes back 15 minutes later and tells us to use the touch pad to pay on the table. There is a touchpad available, but no-one explains how to use it. At this point, other than to bring the food, the wait staff would be better replaced by the touch pad anyways.       Will I come back? Only if it's my co-workers birthday and they choose to go to this place. However, I would never choose to come here when the decision is solely in my hand."}
{"text":"The front so called hostess was very rude. I came in with three kids and she said you and three only. I said yes me and my kids would like a table. Her response oh where's  there mom I said married to some looser. Now could we please get a table. The food was good steak on the 2/20 went up. That sux."}
{"text":"Went today since it was Halloween and a nice day. We walked in and asked if the service was going to take long and a girl with a halo costume replied \"nope\" and walked away. We were seated and asked for drinks and our waitress , Miranda, had a very disgusting attitude and made it VERY clear that she did not want to be or work there. We ordered our food and got it quickly. However , Miranda continued to be very disrespectful and gave dirty looks to our table. Someone needs to teach this GIRL some manners. Not coming back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I understand I visited Applebee's on Cinco de Mayo so it was busy. Took about 35 minutes for us to get our food. The food was average. At least my drink of coke and Jameson was strong."}
{"text":"Food has always been great here,accept for lately every time I visit there are no baked potatoes during dinner hours there for I do not dine at this location. There has been other occasions where other items on the menu are also not available. I really hope that this problem can be fixed because this is my neighborhood Applebees and I would really hope to eat there again."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience of customer service at this place. I can't say anything about the food because we didn't make it that far. We came in around 5 pm and the place looked half empty. We noticed there was 3 families waiting upfront so we were expecting a wait and didn't mind. We were standing upfront for about 7 minutes wondering if anybody ANYBODY is going to notice our presence or at least acknowledge that we were there. Finally, a girl showed up and we assumed she was a hostess. We expected at least:\" hello! We have a wait.. blah blah blah\". Usual. Instead, she went right in front of us, turned around and looked at her list. Then she looked at people nearby, grabbed menus and proceeded going away. No hello, no nothing. We were shocked but we thought maybe she was really REALLY busy and simply didn't think we were there, in front of her, waiting to be put on the list. After waiting another 6 minutes she showed up again and AGAIN turned her back to us and was about to leave. That's when I mentioned to her that we were actually there and waiting to be out in the list. Her reaction was priceless. She asked us:\" well, did you write your name here??!\" I never went to the restaurant where I had to write my name myself on the waiting list. So I told her my name and I mentioned that she passed all three of us TWICE without even acknowledging we were there or simply saying \"hello\". She said she was Super busy busing tables and seating people. We were still there waiting when 3 elderly people came in. After noticing that she didn't even say \"Hello\" or \"good evening\" and ignored them completely we were done with that place. No respect towards guests, no respect towards elderly. The manager really REALLY need to provide better training for the hostess and at least make sure people don't have to write their names on the list themselves. Or at least be around to answer questions about his restaurant."}
{"text":"Roaches on floor manager said they sprayed outside and they come in when people come thru the door. It's really disappointing to eat the see them crawling."}
{"text":"One reason I'm writing this review is in hopes that the manager takes it as a quality assurance opportunity. And to save others who happen to be in the area and thinking of coming here for lunch. My dad and I went here (he's elderly) for a quick lunch. We were seated at a dirty table-not grossly dirty, but it still had spilled stuff on it (could have been overlooked on a busy day)(don't think so). The little flyers that encourage you to get the drinks and appetizers were dirty to the point they stuck together. We sat a good 10 minutes without being recognized, no water--nothing. The manager finally came over to let us know our waitress would be there soon. I pointed out the stuck together flyers and he took them away with an apology--but to me, customers should not have to do that. We both ordered a chicken salad, he got a draft beer and I got a diet soda. The salad was the best part of our experience (fiesta chicken)..We had to ask for utensils because they weren't on the table. Maybe they would have been put there when they cleaned the table. Oh-right-it wasn't properly cleaned. I was not offered another soda until the waitress brought the check which meant that we were going to leave soon anyway--the drink should have been checked way before then. When she brought back my atm card with the check, she called me \"Ms. Barbara\" as if we had been chatting it up all afternoon. It was the first real personal connection and really seemed to be a way to get a better tip. It didn't work. And the kicker was, for a diet pepsi, draft beer, 2 salads at lunch--it came to $30. For awful service, dirty tables and inattentive staff.  To my mind, to run a business, to run a good business, you need to have great customer service. The food can be meh but with great customer service (cleanliness, attention to needs, pleasantness), people will come back.The place was not all that crowded.  We won't be back here."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrible. The bartenders were awful. They got all the regulars served in no time, but the people at the tables had to wait forever. The mixed drinks seemed like they had no alcohol in them. The food was disgusting. Everything had so much salt put on it. Our poor server was serving tables all over the restaurant. That's caused him to not be able to properly keep an eye on his tables. That wasn't his fault though. I blame it on the lack of management. The manager was too busy talking to the regulars to do his job. I will never return to this location and will recommend everyone I know to go somewhere else. Worst restaurant experience ever."}
{"text":"It's great as always, I mean you get what you pay for. Service was good always checking up on us. Food was good we had the chicken and shrimp. Only thing beer took the longest but I understand. But for a quick snack this it the place, been coming here for few months and so far I enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place needs new management. The quality of food has gone down. The atmosphere is not how it used to be. The I got the sliders. The pulled pork was so salty that I couldn't take more than one bite."}
{"text":"We love Applebees for dinner. Lots of options available for meals and drinks. The food is always pretty well priced an the staff is pretty nice. The staff seems to changeover often at this location, not sure why, but that does bring a learning curve to the staff. Overall, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. They said there was a 15-20 minute wait with over half the tables empty. As we waited another customer had to yell across the restaurant for service so she could pay her bill. We finally left after 10 minutes of waiting on nothing. Will never return to this location and maybe the whole franchise."}
{"text":"We have not been at this Applebee's in quite some time and stopped in after leaving another local restaurant after not getting any service after 10 minutes of waiting.  Anyway.......it was great and I wanted to mention on nice our server was.  Roxie rocked and we always had everything we wanted and right on time.  It's always great to write about great service and food.    We'll be back."}
{"text":"Steak was not cooked right they took it back to fix it still couldn't get it right at that point everybody in my party was done eating kids are getting restless I told him I didn't even want the meal and the manager was so nice she covered my whole bill because of their mess up I kept insisting that I would like to pay for what my kids ate and she kept telling me not to worry about it I must say that is very good customer service she was very nice and we will continue to keep eating at this Applebee's"}
{"text":"It was my family's first time at Applebee's and our expectations were not only met, but were exceeded and blown out of the park.   Our server Sarah was prompt with our food and drinks and provided hands down the best service I've ever received in an establishment. I really appreciated how genuine she was and how she always came back to check on us. I got the impression I was talking to an actual person and not a robot. Other servers and people in the food industry should take notes.   While you're here, you MUST try the raspberry lemonade. Bottomless refills. Refreshing. Delicious."}
{"text":"There is some good and some bad. Picked up some car side Togo tonight. The positive is the food was really flavorful. They are currently featuring tex next food on there menu. We chose a chicken and shrimp dish along with a steak dish. Both were juicy and made my taste buds happy. Now the bad the side on the steak were so small it literally made me laugh. They might as well not have even put anything on it. It was really pathetic. Still it tasted good. I also with there was more beer cheese with the app as well. Over all it was about as expected."}
{"text":"Four stars compared to other dine-in chain restaurants. Been to plenty of Applebee's and other restaurants of the same mold and felt as though this one was particularly good. Very friendly and quick service.  I had the four-cheese mac and cheese which I felt was certainly one of the better specials I've had in a while, and surprisingly good for such a simple dish."}
{"text":"Here for $1 margaritas still waiting for my food it's been 20 minutes and it's hardly any business the server left to smoke a cigarette and has not came back she didn't even put my order in & the second server was rude as hell"}
{"text":"Tried this place out of desperation and not wanting to stop at one of the many fast food places nearby. Maybe I would have been better off at one of them. The service was ok, waitress was friendly. Very dark lighting and the food was below average. Maybe it's just me but it seems that the food in all these restaurant chains has taken a turn for the worse. We ordered off the 2 for 20 section and got the wings as an appetizer, which were not wings at all. More like chunks of chicken. Got an order of the chicken strips with fries for the kids, again not very chicken like. And an order of the 3 cheese penne with chicken. Well by now I think you can guess that the chicken sucked here. None of the food was hot, just sort of warm. The food all tasted pretty crappy and very processed. I guess that's what I get for going to a chain like this. Never again."}
{"text":"We won't be back. Advertised as the neighborhood bar and grill. Went to have a drink and appetizers and watch the Diamondbacks. You'd think that a \"neighborhood\" establishment would promote local sports. Ten TVs in the bar and no local game on. We requested the game and the bartender said she'd check into it. Twenty minutes later she asked which game we wanted. Service was not what I expected. She finally put the game on. The guy sitting next responded that he too couldn't understand why your establishment didn't run local games for the neighborhood residents. Where was the management? I'd expect that management would support local teams.   Thumbs down today.....the soup was also cold.  3 out of 10 or 1 out of 5"}
{"text":"Seems everytime we come here experience varies tremendously.   This time ordered The Roma Steak medium. Came out almost raw. It came with cut red saut√©ed potatoes. They were red, they were saut√©ed,  but there were 5 pieces. Really 5 pieces of red potatoes which as we all know are small. A shame. Mushroom on the plate was mushy with a concoction.   Very disappointing probably won't be back again.  Now my guest ordered a Strawberry, Chicken, Avocado. 5 little pieces of strawberries.  Avocado brown and black on the plate. Chicken was tasty, but the spinach in the salad was brown and wilted. Another fail in my book. Waitress was great, the appetizer was great. The chicken wonton tacos, excellent flavors.  That is why for the 2 stars. God Bless all."}
{"text":"I have come to this location for lunch a few times and unfortunately it is true what they say about people leaving reviews for negative experiences. Today I have Valentina - I have never had a server that was so slow, didn't come check on the table, and didn't have all of our items on the bill when it was time for us to pay and leave. I do want to say thank you to Jessica. She noticed how slow the services was and did attempt to check on our order status, get our desert out to us and bring us our change because even that took way to long.   Hoping our next experience is a better one... and of course I will have to remember to leave that positive feed back ."}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant in my life, this was the second time. the bar did not know how to make a highball,  nor did the server know what he was doing. Kathy if she's the manager at the establishment she is very good.. And I might add the only person serving and taking care of the customers. I will be contacting the GM tomorrow morning about the service and the meal we were  served..."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience I've had in a restaurant.   We arrive around 7:45 PM on a Thrusday. The place was empty except for about 4 tables. We were greeted and seated quickly. It took the waitress approximately 10 minutes to finally come over and take our order. She was friendly and polite. She took our drink orders (there were 6 of us; 3 adults and 3 kids) which were pretty simple and we ordered our food (2 appetizer samplers and 2 kids meals) shortly thereafter. This puts us at about... I'll be generous and say 8:15. Then we waited about 30 minutes when finally I watched the table in front of me who was seated AFTER we had arrived get their meals and I finally said something. The waitress forgot to place our order! A man (Not sure who he was or what he had to do with the restaurant) brought us chips and salsa which weren't too bad and the bar tender brought one of us a free drink. Unfortunately, my kids and I waited 45 minutes until they finally brought our order and by that time we were very hungry. The food was decent (I mean... It's bar food). We eat it and we're finally finished. It's approximately 9:20 by now. I want to pay and go home but I can't because the pad at the table isn't working! The manager brings a paper bill with an appetizer sampler and one kids meal comped.. still with everything added up it was $55. Way too expensive and I guarantee I will never be back simply due to the fact their food is not worth $55. Then the table in front of us went berserk. They started yelling at one of the employees for having an attitude and talking about them and as the manager comes out, she thinks it's a good idea to sit down with this disgruntled and beligerant diner RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR TABLE. Isn't there a better place to meet for that? Like... Oh I dunno.... The CLOSED portion of your restaurant? Forget this place. Do not go here unless you're sitting at the bar drinking shitty $1 Margarita's because your life sucks"}
{"text":"I has pasta  3 cheese penned pasta. .no flavor.  We had to ask for silver ware. Won't go back"}
{"text":"I'm so torn!!! Does excellent customer service out weigh not liking some of the food?  So I used to love Applebee's in the 90's and early 2000's. Good food and drinks. I think back then it was all about Applebee's Chillies and Fridays. Wow what a down grade. The menu is limited to mostly processed and pre-made foods.   I walked in on my lunch hour saw a blonde girl she greeted me and said the host will be right with you. Hostess came another blonde but she had glasses. Walker towards the bar area asked if I wanted to sit at the bar I said no. I was sat on the bright side of Applebee's. It was so bright from the sun that I was blinded if I sat normal and the shades were pulled down. It also made my booth hot. I took a picture everyone who was seated here was complaining about it.   My server Christopher came up right away. Btw the hostess said Michael would be my server. I hope there is a Michael working there or that's just plain rude not learning the servers names. Anyway he is sooo attentive and so nice. I would say he was a great server. I ordered an iced tea with lemon. When he returned he told me that on Mondays the cheese burgers are half off. So I looked at them again. I really wanted a regular burger. Didn't see one so I ordered the bacon burger and added pickles. I chose regular fries and I ordered the pot stickers which came with peanut sauce and an oil with chili flakes that they called pot sticker sauce. Christopher asked if I wanted the pot stickers first. I told him I was on my lunch and just to bring out what is ready first.   He came back with my check and said no rush but I know how it is when you are on your lunch and also I can get you an iced tea to go. BEST SERVER EVER!!!! Finally someone who gets it! I only have an hour and I hate waiting for my check. Generally I ask for my check when ordering. This time I forgot and usually they don't do it anyways, so I have to wait 15 minutes for my check and pay. Not this time!!! I whipped out my card and paid before I even got my food.   First the pot stickers came out. They are obviously processed and come frozen in a bag. They are tiny but there are a bunch of them. The peanut sauce is good. Just get a double dose of that. Right after was burger I ordered medium well. I think if I ordered it well it would have come out medium well. It was a bit pinker than I like. I don't send food back unless necessary. So I ate most of it the fries were over seasoned. I should have went with the sweet potato fries like he suggested. I finished my meal it was paid for Christopher asked if I wanted a tea to go and I said yes and a to go menu if they have one. He said they are by the hostess stand. He came back with my tea and made the hostess bring me a menu (they weren't stocked) she practically ran with a menu.   I'm going to see if there is something really good here and fresh just because the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm writing my review while seating waiting for our food. Damn there are less than 50 people right now  walked in around 8-8:10 got seated right away. Our server took our order quick but it's been almost 30-35 mins and we still don't have our food. They won't even at least tell you that \"ohh your food will be there\" or something. Very bad customer service. I've been to diff Applebee's this is the worst. I would understand and willing to wait if there's so many people but fuck man ridiculously upsetting. And to top of that they give the wrong order!!!!! Never coming back again! Fuck this place. The only good thing that happen..... NOTHING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So... as many of you know by now- and I now know about myself- apparently(!) I am masochistic and I love to be abused by mediocre establishments. My husband and I ordered Applebee's to go *gulp*  yet again. Traffic was heavy so we weren't perfectly timed when the stuff came out of the... Oven? Microwave?... er... you get the idea. We get home and the food is cold as all get out. (Some how pizza guys can manage to keep the pies hot... but I digress...). The big problem is we did the '2 for $20' special (you know, the one managers here don't think exist) and my husband's fries were missing. And we don't exactly live a hop, skip, and a jump away. Plus my husband has school to be at in a half an hour. So we call and they put us on the phone with some wretched manager named 'Janie'. And Janie is just aghast apparently that a customer would have the nerve to talk to her... let alone complain! Janie has to get the kitchens side of the story because we all know... the customer is NEVER right and their side of the story should NEVER be heard before the staff! She could barely listen to our side first. Janie is unapologetic, unfriendly, and tries to blame us for this. I guess I missed my second job shift as a cook back there. Or maybe I was supposed to be the car side-to-go guy... Well. She says we can come back... Sorry lady- can't do that unless you want to fill my gas tank and sit in a class for my husband. Then she says she can't void a single item on the receipt. But, my husband asks, she could void the transaction altogether and charge us for what we had minus the burger meal. Ummm... well.... Then she hangs up in my husband's face-- or do those landlines get really bad reception these days? Er. Okay so he has to go to school so I call back within a few minutes and the rude guy who answers the phone already knows we are calling and magically and just as unexpected as  a unicorn parted the sky with glittery rainbows the manager has evaporated and is now in a meeting with 'another manager'. And I am beyond pissed off at this point and tell him that is unacceptable, I need to speak to her, and I will wait. After throwing that curve ball that they totally did not plan for because the hang up was like totally an accident *end sarcasm* he tells me she is just going to void the transaction. And he has attitude galore and is totally unprofessional but considering who his manager is... am I suprised? NO. But I am still yelping about it. ;) So, the point is, from my perspective, they have messed up more than a handful of times over the past year or so and the management clearly has not implemented any changes, they do not apologize still, and they certainly do not try to rectify any wrong doings. I mean, at least TRY to problem solve. Like offer us a replacement meal in the future (and follow through for once), or offer a future desert/appetizer... but because I am NOT interested in freebies- just suck it up and apologize (because you are the manager at a resteraunt- your skin needs to be a little thicker than that) and offer to take off the meal that went wrong (no matter the logistics because we all know it can be done- if there is a will there is a way!!!). I hate to be the one to tell Applebee's staff this... but... us customers are the reason your doors are open and you have a paycheck. If no one comes to your establishment and they tell their friends not to go because you suck... who then tell their friends you are awful... who Yelp about how you deserve a NEGATIVE 3 STAR RATING... eventually doors will start closing, investors will get all upset and go elsewhere, and then another mediocre neighborhood grill will take your place. If you don't want that to happen: change your ways. My advice to Yelpers: Gilbert has some pretty awesome places to eat- please give your money to the places that deserve your time and money- and DO NOT eat here. Whatever excuse you are thinking in your head about why Applebee's is still okay- you are only fooling yourself. This place is leagues below other nearby venues. The end.  Now I am going to go feed my cold, tiny, soggy chicken tenders to my dog if you don't mind. Oh wait. She deserves better than that."}
{"text":"Not terribly bad for a chain restaurant. We had the same waitress both visits and she remembered us, our kids, and what our special needs were. We'll most likely be back."}
{"text":"Applebee's has come a long way since the last time I visited. (years ago) The food was good, service was good. The manager, Omar stopped by our table to see how everything was which we appreciated. He was very funny! We'll be back!"}

{"text":"The short girl behind the bar is named Erica. WORST. BARTENDER. EVER. If you're not a regular you are crap. I had people sit down after me and I had to interrupt to put my order in. This after waiting almost 10 minutes.  The service is great other than the one exception."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying...this was our second time going to this AppleBees...so in all fairness, this isnt a one time issue...as I start...  It had to be valentines night...we walk in and asked to be seated. The girl at the front says the wait is 5 minutes long. On a night like valentines, thats a really good wait time. So, me and my wife waited to be seated. It took around 10 mins to be seated. We sit down and order drinks, as most resturants do. Our waitress name is Jessica C by the way. We look over the menu and decide we want an appietiser and two meals. So, she comes back and we order all it at one time. No issue there and sounds as though it might be a really prompt meal.  A few minutes go by and we do get our appitiser first. I didnt realize that BBQ sauce came with it...no worries, we will just order/ask for ranch. To get Jessica's attention was near impossible. We finally do and i asked her for ranch sauce. No problem she said and we along her way. As we are enjoying what we can of our food, she comes back with other drinks for another guest, well i assumed that the ranch would be on this tray, but no. She gives other people their drinks and continues to take orders. By this time I getting a little heated, we are almost done with our appitiser and no ranch sauce. Again, to get her attention near impossible.. Just so happens when our main dish comes out we ask the cook for ranch and bingo in less than a minute we get it...he even asked if we wanted a little extra...  So, continue our meal...pretty pissed now. And no attention from Jessica C at all. After around 20 minutes or so I do get her attention and asked her for refills on our drinks. And yes i did mention that we got our ranch sauce already. No apology no nothing. This takes forever as well. I finally had to get the bussers attention and ask her for refills. Around 5 mins later Jessica C had our refills at our table...she blamed new customers on her delays. What she doesnt realize is that i watched her the entire time mess with that stupid computer. After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to go and asked for our check. Oh Boy that was at our table in less than a minute. I payed her for the meals and didnt leave a tip...heck no...a tip is a thank you for great service...didnt happen! Even when we left the girls at the front didnt even say thank you for coming and visiting...WE NEVER PLAN TO EVER VISIT AGAIN!!"}

Top Shelf, Long Island Ice Teas - Amazingly delicious and strong enough to give a buzz; I will be back for this.   Mozzarella Sticks - Hot, cheesy and worth ordering again, came w/ marinara.   Spinach Dip - Hot and cheesy with a few pieces of artichoke in the dip. Chips were too salty, accompanied with a mild salsa, salsa was just ok.   Boneless Buffalo wings, Honey BBQ - Savory and sweet, accompanied with celery and ranch.   Onion Rings - Large pieces or onion, breading was too thick. Accompanied with BBQ sauce.   Blackened Chicken Penne - Amazing and slightly spicy. Blackened chicken over penne with diced tomato and a few leaves of spinach in a creamy alfredo all topped with extra cheese on top. Accompanied with a garlic bread stick.  Craving this right now.   Service: Our server was attentive and recommended we add another drink before happy hour was over, I appreciated this.   Atmosphere: Causal, family friendly.  The customers at the time depend on the special for that day. Misbehaving children has been rare.   Will I be back?  Yes.  Applebee's is consistently good, usually I order the 2 for $20, but I choose the 7oz sirloin. I have noticed the sirloin with broccoli as a side has as odor. Perhaps it is the steamed broccoli, but I won't be getting that anymore.   The blackened chicken penne was worth ordering again, this also comes in the 2 for $24 deal, but is blackened sirloin.   The all you can eat soup and salad lunch special is delicious too. This special runs from 11AM to 3PM. There are about 8 salads to choose from and at least 2 soups; yes, you are able to mix and match.  My favorites: French onion soup, pecan chicken salad, and the oriental salad (grilled).     Happy Hour Special : 1/2 price alcholoic drink, excluding shots.  1/2 price on selcet appetizers.    *** This is my first real review, feedback is appreciated."}
{"text":"Came in 930 tonight for dinner after a show at the Smith Center and they told us it was a 15 minute wait. The place was 3/4 empty but we were informed they had no server available.  If you are going to stay open till 12 then you need to have enough staff to serve your guests. Wound up going to another place down the street that was willing and able to accommodate the 2 of us immediately."}
{"text":"I like Applebee's food but the service at this location is really, really bad not once but twice."}
{"text":"We haven't been to an Applebees in like ten years. We received a $30 gift card for Christmas so a course we went. Customer service is really great here with all the employees being cheerful, having smiles on their faces and being friendly.   My wife ordered a medium well steak with mash potatoes but it came rare. It took nearly 30 minutes to get her new steak and when it arrived they gave her steamed vegetables instead of mash potatoes but they quickly brought them out when mentioned.   Applebees gets four stars because of their great customer service and specials plus the manager and server apologized countless times about the steak. They comped my wife's dinner and offered us dessert for free. It was a great gesture and definitely left us with a great impression.  We will be back at some point as the food is decent and the prices reasonable especially during happy hour and other promotional days. Its definitely a great place to unwind, enjoy some comfort food and drinks."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm here is because of 3 gift certificates my daughter gave us.  Service was fine, our bartender was good. Disappointed in their corporate beer selection though. I hate the standard beer selection. Do I want a glass of crap light or glass of that crap light.  Food was surprisingly decent, we did the 2/25 deal. My wife got the chicken over rice, and I got the shrimp. The one complaint I have..........ok this is a family and corporate establishment. When you have 2 guys across from one another at the bar having a loud and vulgar conversation, this is where the bartender or the management steps in and says, hey.......one more F bomb and your going to have to leave. Don't get me wrong, I use the word at least 12 times a day, but I don't shout it across the bar to my drunk counter part in conversation. They both even made jokes how they've been asked to leave before because of their language. If I had my kids with me, we would of had a different situation on our hands."}
{"text":"I always get the same steak dinner each time I visit Applebee's, and each time I try to figure out why they get such bad reviews. I've never had an issue with my service or meal. The desserts are good too."}
{"text":"Great club sandwich in the lunch combo! They serve pepsi here, whilst other Applebee's randomly serve Coca Cola. I don't care, but though you might want to know.."}
{"text":"Not a good experiance. Or waitress was great and sweet as can be but the food was undercooked. By the time my food was ready to eat my husband was finished. I just got a to go box. Not a great start to date night!"}
{"text":"It's Applebee's ..and my experience was just that --  I saw the commercial with the spinach dip app and decided to go check it out. Cruised myself to Applebee's for happy hour, there was no wait - got a great seat where I could see out the window and day dreamed while I drank my yummy peach tea (had real peaches in it) and my app with chips and dip. It was ten bucks and they had the fancy little electronic gadget on my table so when I was ready I could pay via it and be on my way."}
{"text":"Wouldn't it be nice if when you got seated at a restaurant, somewhere, ANYONE, would come over to at the very least acknowledge that we have been sitting here for 10 minutes?! Finally someone rushed by and said someone would be with us soon. Meanwhile the manager is wandering around, clearly not managing or helping, but doing something \"managerial\". Perhaps it's a staffing thing, or perhaps it's just incompetence on the part of the manager and their staff. Either way, I am not at all impressed with my experience here thus far. I seriously doubt I will ever be back to this location."}
{"text":"What is it about Applebees that makes us keep coming back to this chain?! Maybe the reasonable prices, the happy hour... but I always leave feeling under satisfied. The food is mediocre. I can think of so many other local places that serve quality American food but for some reason, we find ourselves at Applebees at least twice, maybe 4-5 times a year. It's a safe choice for late light munchies. And this location has friendly, attentive staff. You'll always be seated right away. And one of their charming bartenders does magic! Try to find him. See ya next time, Applebees."}
{"text":"The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a \"night out\" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.  Two stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"It's was okay but this time I came it was so many flies flying around. The service was mediocre at best and our waiter was constantly talking to another couple. I wasn't very happy I actually got my food to go this time. I probably won't be back my other times here was good though. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Got some lunch with a friend here last week. When we arrived, we had to wait 5 minutes for someone to seat us. It was dead in there! A couple of servers noticed us but noone came to help us. Finally, after being seated, we had to wait another 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. We were more than ready to order at that point. I ordered a lunch combo, which consisted of a grilled shrimp salad and the California Turkey Club. My friend got the chicken brocolli pasta. We got our food reasonably fast.  Anyway, my salad was pretty tasty but the sandwich was BLAND. The portions were tiny. My friend said she liked the pasta but it looked kinda dry to me.  I would recommend going somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"Not really a big fan of Applebees. The service is always on the slower side. It's freezing as heck inside. The servers lack character. The food is pretty much less than mediocre. Only come in here once in a blue moon when we don't know where to eat and do not want to drive far.   Last visit we stumbled in during happy hour which is my favorite hour of the day! They had a happy hour menu (per picture) which I thought was pretty decent. The Blue Coconut Rita was one of my favorites, and it was only $5 during HH.   Also our server didn't charge us 1 of the drinks I ordered and discounted one of the foods we ordered, which I did not complain about but thought it was kinda odd. So for that I did add an extra star. Lol   Any other day, Applebees is a solid 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Spent the New Year at this place after a brutal Fiesta Bowl game.  Had a nice meal and complementary drink for toasting the new year.  Took the edge off before the 4 hour drive back to reality. Thanks."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on 12/23/15.  We all ordered the salad bar with either soup or baked potato.  Food was good and our server was very friendly.  Only issue was the LOUD music.  We could barely hear each other talk.  There were only about  15 people in the whole restaurant and all you could hear was this blaring music.  We asked the server to turn it down, he said he had & will do it again, but that the bartender will turn it up again.  When you look up, there are speakers about every 5 feet on both sides of the ceiling so there wasn't even a table where you could escape the noise.  We all sighed with relief when we walked outside..."}
{"text":"Worst Applebee's ever! Go to the one in Boca Park instead.  Terrible service! First time I've never left a tip. Yes, it was that bad!"}
{"text":"Our server wouldn't check if our table was fine or if our food was okay. My grandfather's steak never came out even when we had finished our food, manager was unprofessional when finding a solution seemed like he was new or didn't care. By the time we were leaving our server never came by to check on us or to close our check. She completely avoided us. It was very disappointing service tonight usually we go there to have a fun night with the family and leave happy as well as satisfied."}
{"text":"This is solely covering the topic of to-go orders.  I ordered on the website, which told me it would be ready for pickup at 3:54pm. I arrived at 4:05 pm, parked in the to-go parking, and waited for approximately 2 minutes before I got out and went inside.  My order was ready, the bartender attempted to assist (even though she had a bar full of customers to handle of her own) so props to her for that.    A manager arrived shortly thereafter to take my payment.    Overall a smooth experience, but I would suggest that the lettuce in the salads could be fresher, going forward."}
{"text":"Boy, its super hot today! Was able to order to go and pay with gift card and cash. Super friendly waitstaff and host. Awesome people who know how to acknowledge their customers. Ill be coming back to dine in soon after i gather my groupies. Lol."}
{"text":"Samantha the bartender was awesome - very attentive and made sure everything was right for me. Their TAP IS COLD!!! so my blue moon was very tasteful. I ordered both times there with NY steak with fries and mash potatoes. AMAZING both time my steak came delicious and the fries were crispy and fresh - seems like made to order - unlike other places that just heats it up and throw on grill to get grill marks. the chef is amazing. will go again when I am in town"}
{"text":"The wait was short to get seated, but the wait for our food was extremely long. Not even that busy so dont understand the wait. When they bring out my steak salad it was a burned steak, that was greyish. Not wanting to wait any longer for something i told the manager to take my plate i lost my appetite, all he said was sorry about that and walked away. Thanks Applebees for a wonderful anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Anthony! Brought my mom and sister in for lunch. My mom is quite the handful and Anthony was still so sweet and helpful while we were trying to order! Thanks so much :)"}
{"text":"Came to Applebee's again today. Another excellent visit. Ahmad and Kelly were very attentive when we walked in. The staff always seems to be in a great mood. Kria was an awesome server and let us know about all the happy hour specials and answered a few questions we had. I love it here. Normally rarely post yelp reviews but this staff deserves to be recognized every time."}
{"text":"Why is every place going downhill? When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order.  Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get...  We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward.  Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample.  The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there...  We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell.  So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home.  We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order. This one is going on the list as well. Next time we'll drive all the way out to Baseline and 51st Ave. They seem to still understand customer service out there."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience.  Couldn't get a refill on my coffee till I order a beer and then was denied service at 37 years old.  My id was expired by a month and I didn't notice because I never get carded because I am 37 years old. Our server only showed up to take the order. She never came back to refill our drinks and a manager had to come out and get me a coffee. It's a shame Applebee's is spending all kinds of money to reform their failing brand and just have know idea about The ever-changing landscape of the service industry.  I will be sure to let the people I talk to know that new grills and new menu items didn't change a poorly run restaurant"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Came in got seated in the bar, 3  workers behind the bar not doing a damn thing totally ignored us. Our \"server\" never came over to even offer water to us in the 10 minutes we sat there.  We got up and left, the hostess said thanks and we reacted with \"for what\" as we walked out! Place is a joke....  Drove down the street to chili's and enjoying our dinner!"}
{"text":"The only reason they are getting 1 star is because you can't select 0 .... But their service here is absolutely HORRIBLE!!   We sat for 15 minutes with no one coming for our drink order even after going to the bar to ask for a waiter we waited another 5 minutes and all they did was stare at us.. Needless to say we got up and left . Spend your money some where else!"}
{"text":"I dig their quesadilla burgers and triple chocolat meltdowns, it gets me every time. The quesadilla burger is a work of art, its not messy at all to eat, has the feel and texture of a proper quesadilla with the tortilla bun and somehow the final cook along with all of the toppings come out perfectly and in tact. The flavor is is great and consistency is for the most part there. This time we also had a loaded brisket enchilada and that was decent. They give you enough meat to keep you satisfied, comes with rice, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, etc. Yea we went full Mexican for this lunch. Finishing it all off we had the almighty triple chocolate meltdown aka the best lava cake money can buy HOWEVER this time the brownie wasnt super hot as it usually is, it was room temp, the fudge was warm but not hot like it normally is. If it was piping hot, the contrast with the vanilla ice cream is what melts your heart away, and is a clear 10/5 on all time best desserts. My other fav dessert around here is the Pizookie from BJ's Brewery and that always comes out hot. Sad, but still 4/5 overall."}
{"text":"Great appetizers! All the food was fresh and hot. Really hit the spot.. The service, was not up to par. I was thirsty and finished my water promptly. Not once did our server come over to refill.. The food was good, the staff could use some uplifting and improvement."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would there was a long wait time which was expected considering it's a Saturday night that's not a problem we finally got seated down and we waited like a good 10 mins before we were serviced and we waited 20 mins before our appetizers finally came there was only one good item out of the 5 that were ordered. Our main entrees were very bland  and had very little portions. Also the oil for frying is very old and burnt . My mother ordered fried shrimp and it tasted like old burnt oil ,we complained to the manager and she was the only helpful person in the whole place and she fixed our bill and made the situation better .WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN"}
{"text":"Came in tonight @ 10:45p. We patiently waited for 5 min w/ ppl at bar & not a worker in site. Unfortunately, nothing In area was open & we were hungry so we waited. Finally, I walked in the kitchen & found manager on personal phone & other worker hanging out. Instead of apologizing, manager looked at me in disbelief. So Rude! We sat while manager found server & then hung out laughing @ bar with friends. When the manager sat us, he pointed out that 2 tables were dirty & NEVER bothered to clean them. He never once checked on us. Service was good, Emily (I believe), food ok, but manager is representing a horrible example of good work ethic. We may not be back because of the manager's examples. Just pathetic for a corporate company. U should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Simply put.  Go North five miles to Strongsville!  The no lemon in the water can happen.  The cold French onion soup?  Shouldn't someone brown the cheese?  Shouldn't the waitress hear you say something?  Ok trick question, chicken tortilla soup does it have tortillas in it right?! Nope. Does waitress come back? Nope.  My knife was covered in dried cheese from last person.  Left knife out for the waitress, never got another.  The \"pink\" burger was brown, the brown burger was black as in burnt!  I know there will be a manager stop by right?  He was sweeping, or someone in a blue shirt was.  The bartender talking on the restraurant's phone, so that's why the liquor was missing?  There are better Applebee's, hell anyplace would be better.  If steak & shake served liquor....."}
{"text":"love love love the steaks they make!!! there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebee's because I want their stake; I eat stakes everywhere, even the Japanese Steak Houses where they only make steaks weren't like Applebee's :)  the only No at this place was, I oredered pine apple juice and it was so old that it smelled and tasted and kind of even looked like Mold;  but other than that I love theirr Stakes :)"}
{"text":"The server was over the top obnoxious.   He insisted on having our names just to take our order.  He was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive.  He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.  When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.  When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.    The manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table, so we had to listen to all the Applebee's rules and regulations.  Let me tell you, there are a lot of them. The manager's list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost, every sentence started with \"I can't\" or  \"You can't\".  The manager made me hate this place even more."}
{"text":"We had to wait over 10 minutes for drinks. Our waiter Joshua was great. However,  the forks were dirty and sticky. We were given more which were also dirty. The knives were dirty with small food particles.  The small plates were also dirty. My friends liked their food. I got the sample appetizer plate. It was bad. We had the chocolate lava cake which was delicious.  The pomegranate ice tea was delicious.  Probably will never eat there again."}
{"text":"The service was slow, plates were dirty and our water came to the table only after we asked for it three times. The spicy Asian boneless wings had a funny taste to them."}
{"text":"Service is kinda slow. Drinks were pretty solid when they finally arrived. The food was average at best for an Applebee's. I would probably hit a drive thru before coming back here for a sit-down. Management really needs to figure out the issue with the service here, i would hate to see them go but they need to fix a few things. Good luck Applebee's."}
{"text":"Service was so slow. Took for ever to get waited on and soft drinks took a long time as well. Then after placing our order (2) orders of fish and chips and (1) 1/2 rack of ribs took over 45 mins to be brought out. The waiter had to flagged down to get refills ever dissapointed in the service."}
{"text":"Had a gift card and honestly BROKE right now. The girls at the bar (Se√±ora and Nay) are working their ass off and have looked at me anytime I start to question something, they know before I do. Will definitely be back, minus the gift card."}
{"text":"Baby, baby, baby. I am holding my chest hoping that my heart won't give out. The first person to review this joint described the food as being salty. My friends, this lad was correct... Beyond correct. We ordered a number of appetizers and somehow each of them tasted like some naughty salt fairy had sprinkled her noxious gift. I literally could taste little beyond the salt, so much so that I could taste the actual granules. Baby, if you're tasting granules it means that in addition to the precooked salt, someone had the bright idea to sprinkle salt topping post cooking.   There are few reviews I have hated to provide but this is one I reach within myself for; the truth is the staff is amazingly kind and helpful and if it weren't for this fact, I would have needed to provide a 1."}
{"text":"After a day out hiking in the mountains I was pooped and wanted to just get something fast and reasonably priced to eat and then crash.  Came here as it was close to our hotel, sat in the bar and had the speediest and most charming server ever.  The dude was killing it handling the bar and the high tops around it.  We both had a non-alcoholic drink and those fixed price special meals.  For the two of us it came to $29 and that ain't bad.    Andrew M was our server and I salute him for his skills in handling his business."}
{"text":"Everything was great! My family tries to find any excuse to go here.. Our server \"Marcelo\" was so great! We were very pleased. We didn't have to ask for anything, he was on top of all of our drinks and our food was delicious! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Their food is... \"okay\" We ordered and then literally 2 minutes later, we got the food. The food was dry and cold. I know it doesnt take 2 minutes to make 2 meals, so maybe this happens to be someone elses order that they forgot or something... who knows, but there was no way they cooked up our food in 2 minutes. I think applebees has become my last resort. we didnt even finish our food. it was gross."}
{"text":"Food is good , however staff could be a little more friendlier .. Only reason I went was I had a gift card, i probably would go back because of the food was yummy"}
{"text":"The worst experience I ever had at a restaurant. My 2 friends who were US Marines came to visit from NY, and we all decided to go to Applebees. We had the worse experience at Applebee's, the server did not sit us down. The restaurant was not busy at all and many of the servers were talking while one could simply have taken the time to get our order or drinks. After the server showed, I asked if there were any vegetarian options she replies \"i don't know, look on the menu\". Despite of her rude behavior we had kindly ordered our food. She did not come by once to ask us if we were good, took at least 30 minutes to bring in water and food was taking even longer. As the boys were getting restless they decided to just leave. I hope that Applebees takes it into consideration on how they treat their customers and provide a better service to other customers in future."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waiting 10 minutes to be seated, another 15 to actually get our drinks and place our food order. Waitress failed to give us straws upon ordering drinks, asked for some- only to receive a \"sure\" and an eye roll to go along w it.  45 minutes later, we receive our food and..... My mother's chicken breast was charred black, my fried shrimp were soggy and sitting in a puddle of grease. Waitress checked in at her other tables and didn't visit us once during our meal-- much less offer us refills. After we finished, she brought out the check and left. This behavior is unacceptable and should be fixed. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food..to start off we had a server that did explain that she was new , BUT if you take forever to bring drinks then you probably shouldnt be a server cause thats the easiest part...so me and my bf get our sodas and takes another 10 min to get my sons apple juice! And we made our dinner orders when we ordered our drinks and we got our appetizers on time and waited forever for our food and come to find out by a new server that took over, that our order was never put in and that she would buy us dessert and she had told the cooks to rush and make our food. If it wasnt so late(after 10pm) and we didnt have to eat we wouldve just left. We finally get our food and my rice was hard and chips were stale. Yes it was nice to have been offered free dessert(which is why i gave an extra star)but service was bad and food made it worse. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The wait isn't long on a Friday night but the music is too loud. It seems like you're in a club, you can't hear the person sitting in front of you. They play all kinds of music which is cool but not a place to go with family, especially when you're trying to have a conversation. The customer service is great but don't think I will be visiting again on a weekend."}
{"text":"Went with my husband for lunch. We were seated immediately. Our waitress greeted us with dirty dishes in her hands and took our drink order. Mine and my husbands meals came quickly and tasted good; although mine was on a well worn plate. Within 5 minutes of eating our waitress asked if we wanted dessert. Huh? We had barely started our lunch. After we told her no, she promptly brought us our check. Didn't know I wasn't wanted there for business. She was friendly, but very hyper vigilant. This particular Applebee's is a hit or miss restaurant. Good luck."}
{"text":"Would have been good if my steak had come out the way I ordered it but was tooo rare for me so waiter took it back.  15 minutes later I asked what happened to my steak?   Oh???? Every thing else on my plate had been eaten or was cold.  Steak came out hot and over done.  I am done here!  Service was good that's why 2 stars."}
{"text":"My work schedule prohibits me from visiting Applebee's as often as I like. When I get the chance, I visit the Rainbow location. If you arrive at the right time, you'll be greeted at the door by the always smiling and helpful Ninfa.  Stick to the basic fare that Applebee's is known for and you will most likely enjoy a decent meal. The bar is especially attractive to the local crowd that doesn't want to deal with smoke and video poker machines begging you for your last dollar. The service ranges from good to great, as long as you remember that during their busiest of times, there could be be dozens of people wanting attention as quickly as you."}
{"text":"Sadly we had a poor experience here. Took a while until we could order. Our server Mayo seemed to be in a bad mood, clearly because of under staffing. The four cheese mac and cheese was dry and bland. One of us ordered steak that was under cooked. Our server made an awkward joke at the end of the night after we needed to correct the bill. Not a great time.   Ps. As of this month they no longer have a drink menu which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"I am a very easy going guy, I have been here 3 times and this place was horrible. Most of the ppl I speak to have also had bad experiences. From cold food to never not once having a decent waiter. Every few months I will try again to see if there have been improvements and still nothing.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Very unorganized when they bringing your appetizer last and food first not koo. Plus waiting a hour for food not to mention the 20min  (not even driks)wait for to order!"}
{"text":"Navigating through space on this giant rocked so surely named Terra I find myself utterly confused and nearly constantly hungry. Upon my many travels I have found myself being forced to eat food other bipedal carbonoids have made for me. This place was full of many such creatures. All of those employed by this Earth station were genuinely nice and more than willing to service any such needs as long as they were confined to the ramifications of their rule book or \"menu.\"  Where I am from we do not eat mammals, fish, or anything that may have been ripped from their bodies no matter how willing they may have seemed. I order a plain baked potato, steamed broccoli, potatoes fried in the french style and a plain vegetable style burger. I asked if our human service representative would bring them out one at a time in alphabetical order(as is the custom where I am from) and they kindly obliged.  All of the food tasted exactly as I remembered learning they would taste. Our human representative checked in on us intermittently while servicing other tables full of flesh bags. They visited our table a total of 9 times which I found to be nearly perfect. The only problem I encountered was with the other \"humans\" that were visiting this station in search of food. They seemed mostly ruder and totally unkempt. For this I felt what you would call empathy for our service person. Surely they deserve to be treated better during their short time on this space sphere. Perhaps Applebee's should consider giving their future station visitors an I.Q. test before allowing them to enter the establishment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Applebee's to have dinner this week. To start we ordered the sampler for an appetizer: boneless chicken wings, chicken quesadilla, mozzarella sticks and spinach artichoke dip. The appetizer plate was half a$$ed, thrown on a plate, the boneless chicken wings weren't even tossed in a sauce. We we asked about management about the chicken and she stated \"we've never mixed the sauce with the wings\" but there was a clear picture proving that statement in correct. I ordered pasta and he ordered a steak medium rare, the steak came back practically mooing. After sending the steak back to be cooked more, it still wasn't cooked right. To top everything off, I ordered a peach ice tea which came with pure syrup and a little bit of tea. I took 1 sip and asked for a water instead...we were still charged for the drink. The quality of this restaurant has really gone down! :/"}
{"text":"I came here to order to go and we sat at the bar and the bartender have a attitude you can tell by her face that she didn't want to be here or serve guest. Like come on if your not enjoying you job then leave people are trying to have a nice time specially when they are working all day. Really professional using your phone in front of your guys."}
{"text":"First time there we ended up walking out because we couldn't get any service. Second time there service was ok, but the food was terrible. Ive never been a Applebees girl, but I wanted to prove myself wrong . Well I was right , I will never step foot into one again..."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and overall it was a good experience.  Arrival Upon entering I was treated right away and was immediately seated.  Only problem is I was given a Spanish version of the menu.  Service The service was very good; greeted right away and drinks were brought moments after ordering and were refilled without asking.  Checked up on me regularly throughout my dining experience.  Food The food was decent.  Ordered the chicken finger plate and substituted the coleslaw for mexirice.  The fries tasted good as did the rice, however o didn't care for the chicken fingers.  Overall If your looking for a quick bite to eat in a friendly atmosphere I would definitely visit this location."}
{"text":"I don't like the burgers with supposedly everything built in or mixed in opposed to real bacon  on top of cheese with fresh lettuce and onions...just old school.  Salad was wilted and not very good or crisp."}
{"text":"Came around 5pm this Friday. Food was good. No complaints. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings my son chicken strips and fries. And we shared cheese sticks. The only little issue was the waiter had to come back to ask us what side my son had and cheese sticks came after food."}
{"text":"I will try this place once every few months hoping that it is different, but it never is. Take it from me and the endless reviews when we say: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. Horrible service. Each time it's been a 2 hour experience just for dinner. Management clearly doesn't care to change it."}
{"text":"Ehhh. I always dislike going to Applebee's unless my family wants to go so I just go to enjoy their company. Went last night. Ordered the pick 3 sampler. I tried the wonton chicken tacos (they were gross and greasy). I also tried the brisket nachos (tasty but the tortilla chips were so thin I couldn't grab one without it breaking so I ate the whole thing with a spoon). Last, I tried the s'mores churros. These had a good flavor but were overcooked and cold by the time I got them. The chocolate sauce was chocolate syrup straight out of the Hershey's bottle. Not very pleasant. Our waitress was friendly and refilled our drinks quickly. This is the first time I've been to Applebee's since they got the tablets on the tables that you use to pay the bill with. You can order on them too. We refused to use it because we felt strange about the tip situation. Why should I tip the waitress 15% minimum if she doesn't take our order or handle the bill at the end? Seems weird."}
{"text":"As far as chains go, Applebee's isn't my favorite-- given the choice, I'd usually opt for Chili's or Outback for a similar product.  But they have a good 2 for $20 deal, a handy online ordering system, and they're pretty close to our house.  We've gotten takeout a couple of times, and it's not amazing, but our orders have been accurate and we've never had any problems.  Their salads are always fresh-tasting, and they've got a nice variety of dressing options.  My husband says the bourbon chicken and shrimp is really good.  I've liked the oriental chicken salad (with grilled chicken), chicken tenders, and honey crunch shrimp.  They always quote 15 minutes until orders are ready and that's a little overly optimistic, but I've never had to wait too long.  Not my favorite option in the area, but sometimes when we're feeling lazy it does the trick."}
{"text":"If I could go negative, I would and I am usually a big fan of Applebee's! Had the same experience with the gift card fiasco as someone else reviewing and it didn't impress me.   Called in car side yesterday and showed up at time they said.  Sat in my car with another customer beside me for over 5 mins, no one came out. I called the store and they sent someone out to get my name and order!! Um, didn't you get all that PLUS make n color when I ordered?!? He had to then go back in to get it.  I was livid by now so I just gave him the cash and drove off.  Never again will I go to this one.  I will drive outta my way next time..."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Applebees on 1/10/14.  As usual, we ordered off the lunch menu.  The last time we were here, I ordered the mac/cheese and it wasn't very good...kind of watery with little cheese.  I ordered the m&C again and this time it came prepared perfectly.  Our server, Jennifer B was very attentive without being overbearing.  Our server asked me to take their survey at my convenience and showed me the information on the receipt for taking the survey.    I took the survey today, answered all the questions, gave the experience a very good rating until I came to the last section of the survey...Applebees wanted my full name and address plus phone number and I would not give that information.  So Applebees, here's a suggestion for you...if you want your guests to provide answers to a survey, MAKE IT ANONYMOUS!    The 5 star rating is for the restaurant, food and service.   I give the survey a 0.1 star rating."}
{"text":"Not happy! We went to dinner tonight to celebrate our family member Michael's birthday. We wanted it to be fun an special so the first thing we did before he got there was tell our server that we were celebrating a birthday and if they could please bring out the little sundae and sing for him at the end. Now, not only could you immediately tell that all but maybe 2 of the employees (including the hostess and our server) were completely uninterested and just wanted to go home but we werent even done eating yet when the server comes back and asks MICHAEL if he even wanted them to come out and sing for him or if he just wanted to skip the whole thing to which Michael, being an older man, then said, \" Well no, that's ok then, I've heard it before, its wonderful\". The server then proceeded to ignore us completely when we told him that we WOULD like them to sing. That was the whole point of us telling him (the server) in the first place. I personally was really irritated by this and so were the other two people that came to show love and appreciation to Michael, who has done so much for us. First off, WE were paying the bill, WE requested the surprise. The fact that we are young does NOT mean that we can be easily dismissed because someone is choosing to be careless and lazy. The server never should have come to ruin it by ASKING if the birthday man even wanted it after we had already told him That's what we wanted. That's the whole point of it being a surprise, whether or not its been experienced before."}
{"text":"Awesome, good food here. Don't say this often about Applebee's. Had the bourbon chicken and shrimp and it was to die for. Just delicious. Our waiter Shanel was excellent. She took very good care of me and I couldn't complain at all.   I will definitely come back here again.....  A++ in my book"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming here and I just have to say that my experience was great!! My servers name was Jeff he was courteous, polite and most of all very attentive. He came around a few times during our meal to check and make sure that everything was ok. Our food came kind of early as we had just gotten our appetizers a few minutes before but I didn't mind it since we normally like taking left overs home anyways. I had the fiesta lime chicken and I have to say kudos to the chef! It was nice and moist you could feel it in the first bite. The rice wasn't exactly my cup of tea but I normally go for the chicken anyways. My son had the tenders and fries the tenders were also pretty moist which was great and the fries were salted to perfection based on my experiences today I will definitely return to this location! Hope that Applebee's reads this review and knows what a great employee they have! The brownie bite dessert is the best!! Yum! Make sure you try it if you're into chocolate and ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Usually I like Applebees...but not this one.  35 minute wait for a table, my date order a medium well steak that was rare...twice, and our server scratching his privates while taking our order.  Best part of the experience was getting a tugjob in the parking lot while waiting for our table."}
{"text":"I normally have a 4 star time when I go there or order out but today my husband wanted to order out and I wasn't feeling it but I agreed I got the French onion soup(my favorite), garlic mashed potatoes, the boneless honey BBQ wings, and the double glazed ribs. My husband got something else, everything was good until I got to the ribs I ate the smaller end piece it was soo peppery not spicy peppery like they caked it with pepper... My lips have been tingling for 45 minutes and it made me so sick it was soo covered in pepper. The worst part is from what I could taste from the sauce it tasted watery and bland. I am sorry but this had to be shared I've never had something like this happen to me at a restaurant. I really hope this never happens again."}
{"text":"Mondays are burger night. Any burger for $6.99 only from 4p- close. Tuesdays - kids eat free & Wednesdays are the steak night for $10.99."}
{"text":"Applebee's is your regular bar/grill chain restaurant.  This one is very basic and easy to describe.  Like all other Applebee's  Serivce is decent, nothing over the top Food is somewhat infrequently in quality but maintains portions."}
{"text":"I was here a yr ago in Jan 2015.  Had great serivce. Good food and drinks.  They even open the door for us while entering. And after leaving from having our late lunch here."}
{"text":"We Love the Applebees. So when we were in the area, went here, and had a really graat time and great food. Every time we dine in, we are treated with fast friendly service!  We recommend Applebees to anyone looking for a really good meal for an affordable price in a friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My waitress DJ was fantasmagoric, going above and beyond. She checked with me and my guest about a half dozen times without being invasive; she's just a natural. She's also genuine, a nice touch, which goes along way in the restaurant business. She made my desert not just a dish but a mini celebration on New Years Eve. Love Ya DJ; hope to see you again. And kudos to the Bee for hiring her. Sincerely Frank"}
{"text":"Server just seemed out of it. Wasn't very attentive or personable. Food took a really long time to come out and our section was not very busy. Dinner portions and sides were very small and not very appealing looking. Everything tasted really mediocre. Steamed broccoli was overdone and wilty."}
{"text":"Visited here whilst in town to see friends August 21st 2012, the staff were so helpful especially as one of our friends has to use an electric scooter. The servers were brilliant, helpful and never to far away if you had a question.  Food came out very promptly, hot and cooked perfectly.  What a thing, find a restaurant that gives you want you want.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Had the steak wontons for the first time and omg sooo good. I'll come get those again just for a lunch. Also had a great entree. Our server Erica was sweet and on o point with all our needs tkank you so much."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the food was good (when we finally got it) I have been here several times with my guy and his family since they live in Henderson and you can't really screw up a chain. You CAN however, screw up on service and while we have had good/ok/poor service before - this last Sunday took the cake. We (my guy/parents/myself making 4) we came in for lunch together and it was before the 'lunch rush' because there wasn't a wait to sit at a table like we are used to. We get situated with the usual 'the server will be with you shortly' nearly 15 minutes goes by and the girl behind the bar comes out to take our drink order after catching eye contact with us a few times during that period. I'm a bartender myself and I also sometimes have to wait tables so I know how that goes- I assumed she didn't know we were her table so that was the delay. She takes our order for drinks and nearly 15 mins pass, just two sodas a beer and a water. Nothing fancy. We weren't in any rush as we were enjoying catching up with one another and watching the game. We all know what we want by this time because it's been a half hour since we first arrived- she starts with my order and stammers over it and I have to correct her. Now, myself being a server- this is when I would've grabbed a pen and notepad- I have a great memory and don't write anything down ever- BUT if you are struggling with the first order which is simply a burger with no pickles w fries, better go grab that pen! She takes the rest of our orders (along with saying she will be back with refills) and we literally take a bet on our food being screwed up amongst ourselves. We continue our conversation and 30+ minutes later our food comes out still no refills- we flag a different server down to get refills. Our food came out after two groups who were sat after us get their food. It was burgers all the way around nothing too time consuming, thought it was odd that we were served last but we let that slide-except one of our orders is completely wrong. We try to get the attention of our server who's chatting with a customer behind the bar (she was only 12 feet from us)  and one of the managers came over instead. We tell him the issue with one of our orders being completely wrong- it was a cowboy burger with no cheese that was ordered but we were delivered a mushroom Swiss. When he asks the server/bartender she says no, they ordered a mushroom swiss! When my guy's mom corrects her and says 'No, it was a cowboy burger with no cheese' she looks at the guy she's been chatting up with and says 'oh, I'm sorry.. they ordered a mushroom swiss and I guess it was still in my head'  This is when that pen comes in handy! The manager says he will get it fixed asap, by then everyone's hungry because we have been there an hour now and everyone felt bad about eating in front of one of our party. Her burger came out pretty quick which made us wonder why they all took so long originally. We line up our empty glasses on the edge of our table because our server is still too busy chatting with the guy sitting at the bar. It takes me f.o.r.e.v.e.r. to even drink half a glass of anything so for my glass to be empty, you know it's been quite some time! I usually never even need a single refill. A different server asks if we need refills as she walks by and we tell her that would be most appreciated. Our server just glares at us, then goes back to her conversation. About five minutes after we get the refills from the kind server who had a completely different section, our server brings us refills (when our glasses are practically still full) and it's the wrong drinks anyway. She doesn't say a word and just goes back to talking to the guest at the bar. We are all fed up with her at this point, we now have 8 full glasses of drinks (three being wrong) on our table. I catch her name on her name tag- it's Shauna or a similar spelling. This review is getting extremely long, but she never came to check on us, we didn't need any refills at that point with 8 glasses now for 4 people and I hardly drink anything ever. She never asked us if we needed anything else, or when I clearly needed a box. I waved to her, she saw me and turned her back then pretended to dry glassware that was already dry. I walked over to the kitchen to where I knew the boxes were and asked the same server who got us the refills if she could please grab me a box. She went to the back and I could hear her talking to the manager and she brought me the box a few moments later. I thanked her and proceeded to pack my food up. We waited an additional 20 minutes for the check, I even motioned to our server about needing the check, she nodded but never brought it. I had planned to pay in cash, but instead used my card because it has the option of paying at the table. I wanted to leave no tip at all and I'm always a great tipper!! (25% or more) I left $1 per per person. Shauna or however you spell it, is in the wrong profession."}
{"text":"The service is very slow- it could be because the server's appear to be drinking while working...."}
{"text":"Service was EXCELLENT even servers that weren't ours helped and didn't seem bothered by questions they interacted with my baby, management was GREAT as well. Unfortunately food quality is poor and Applebee's was my favorite restaurant in college. Had to get my steak cooked twice and it still came out bad it was however cooked to the right temperature the 3rd time around but the quality of beef YUCK I couldn't take more then two bites I literally threw up as soon as I got to the parking lot (SORRY to whoever had to clean that up) well at least I had a great margarita and Caesar salad even if I never got a chance to digest it. I'd still go back for a drink at least."}
{"text":"The food was good, BUT they kept bringing the wrong order continuously, my food was dry and I asked for extra Alfredo sauce and they kept forgetting to bring it, they kept saying \"it'll be out in a second,\" they forgot my mans baked potato, they forgot my friend's lemonade and her water with lemon..  refills took forever...   But the food was delicious"}
{"text":"I picked up dinner, and order full slab of their baby back ribs, and they were so TOUGH, barely chewable.  I should of tried them in the car, cause when I got home was too tired to return  them.  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Friend and I had the 2-for-$20.00 menu item. We both chose the Fiesta Lime Chicken which was moist and tasty. I love anything with lime anyway. Sitting at the table, I did notice this computer-like thing advertising other menu items and didn't really pay much attention to it.  But when it came time to pay the check, our food server showed us how we could pay right there from our table. I was pleasantly surprised about that, since I thought the constantly-changing pictures of menu items were for advertising only. I didn't take the time to check out the electronic gadget which also allows one to order as well as pay from the convenience of your seat. Nice!"}
{"text":"Always my go-to favorite for lunch or dinner. They offer a wide variety of choices which is good when you have a friend who cannot eat seafood. Everyone in our party is happy with their choice of meal, and prices are not way out of line. This location is where we had our Christmas luncheon last year, and I think we'll be choosing this place again this December."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my husband I picked a traditional burger, which said it had bacon onions Cheese,pickles and special sauce, well got my burger it was a burger , cheese a drop of sauce, , no onion bacon or pickle, as described on menu, waitress tried to tell me it was chopped up in the meat , come on nothing was chopped up in meat, very disappointed, then waitress says after dinner that kitchen was busy $ they must of gave me the wrong burger, not adjusting bill, or anything , I will never go to another Applebee's again , bad customer service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, it is a chain, but what is open for dinner at 945 where they don't glared at you when you come in for dinner. Really good service, drinks and apps. One star off cause it could be cleaner. Will come again. Part of it is...Be  nice. Stop being rude. Servers were really good. Other guests were not nice. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food!  Megan (the waitress) and Jon (the bartender, maybe manager?) treated us so well! My parents & I came in at 11:30pm and they didn't rush us one bit. Food was super enjoyable and there was a great selection. And Happy hour has $4 margaritas!  The only issue we had was that we weren't acknowledged while we waited for a table... after a few minutes we sat down then a waitress had to escort us to a different table. Other than that, we couldn't have asked for a better meal or better service! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. We received a gift card as a wedding present and we're very excited to have dinner here. Our waitress was incredible she was nothing short of lovely smart and very consistent with making any of our needs happen. We gave her a $10 tip and suggested to her to find a new job somewhere else for her talents can be appreciated. The food however was absolutely disgusting I ordered the triple bacon burger which I would assume would have triple the bacon and had two tiny slices of bacon on top. I I was hoping it at least would taste good. It did not the Baconator from Wendy's has more bacon than this did and the taste is much better. Now for $12 for a burger I would expect more. My partner had the steak and shrimp parmesan he looked nauseous as he ate it. We both just got through our meals and hoped we could just finish. I'm sorry we both agreed we would never go back to Applebees again. We told our waitress over the huge concern over our food however I know there's nothing she could do about it. She did her job and provided exceptional service Applebees did not do their job by providing absolutely terrible food for their clients to eat never ever ever ever will go back."}
{"text":"Awful food and service. I won't be back. Too much for Dennys grade food."}
{"text":"Nice Applebee's. Looked great, food was good. However, service was unacceptable. Waitress didn't know what she was doing. Ordered our drinks, they came ten minutes after. Ordered food. Kids food came 15 minutes before my mom and I's, dads came ten minutes after that when everyone was done eating. Drink (Sprite) was watered down and gave me heartburn (that's never happened before). Has potential, but needs faster service."}
{"text":"This Applebee's is nice, good size. Always busy during dinner. I'd come for their happy hour! great deals on food and drinks! The staff is ok. Management is scary bad"}
{"text":"Service was really slow and our server didn't attend us much. Chips were stale and dip was cold. We got an incomplete appetizer plate. Our table was filled with empty glasses of water and plates because server wouldn't pick them up. Took 10 minutes to get a drink refill. Server didn't know the difference between the diet drink and regular that she had in her hand, so she sniffed the drink and gave us the wrong one.  Never again am I going to this location, it has been the worst service ever."}
{"text":"It's good to see the building on the corner of 36th  and Sunridge Mall (yes there is a street name, but you can't miss the Applebee's) where the old Cheesecake caf√© used to be sporting an Applebee's.   I love Applebee's.  And I love that there is an affordable lunch duo right now.  The soup and Salad combo also rolls into a half-salad or soup and sandwich combo.  It was reasonable and my girlfriend and I liked it.   It's a good go to if you want a simple lunch after shopping or just to go out and have lunch with a friend.  What I'm really excited to try are their drinks deals and their Friday night music.   Admittedly because I'm a \"if I can cook it at home, why buy it at a restaurant \" kind of person, I usually go for the things on the menu I don't often make at home but what earned this Applebee's four stars was their service.   I can't get friendly service at home, since I'm the cook, waitperson and kitchen staff, too!  It didn't hurt that the manager himself 'manned' the 'hostess station' and he did a fine job.   That the manager can sub in anywhere without resentment showing speaks highly of how he treats his staff.   I like that in a restaurant.   I watched the wait staff with children ... they were patient kind and they took their time. They have take out too, and dinner for two which would be great before or after a theatre date! And the restaurant is clean  with a decent d√©cor.   I will be back and let y'all know what the music and drinks are like.  And don't miss the Blondie if you're just in the area and want to have a coffee and a treat.  They are absolutely The Best Thing about Applebee's and definitely big enough to share."}
{"text":"I had a soup and salad lunch combo (French onion soup and Caesar salad) for $5.99. So far I am liking this place. Jessica  was my server and she was friendly and prompt. I had a good experience here for lunch!"}
{"text":"A 9 oz. pour of Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio costs $12.50.  A 750ml bottle (25.4 oz) costs $12.99 in our Pennsylvania State Store system.  Can you say gouging?"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a Applebee's. I wish there was an option for less than one star. Waited for quite sometime to be sat. Got our drinks but our waitress disappeared for a while. Our food came out at extremely different times. Got some of the order and waited an extra 20 minutes for the rest. The wings were soaked in sauce to the point where you could not taste the chicken. The salmon was burnt. The mashed potatoes were clearly microwaved. Then felt quite rushed by the waitress. The manager seemed to be doing three jobs with no help from his staff. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I went here recently for dinner with my family and about 5 minutes after our appetizer arrived so did our dinner so we didn't even get a chance to enjoy our first round. The steak I ordered was way undercooked when I asked for medium well, It was so red it was dripping.  Our server was very nice about the situation but it was the manager that had an attitude.  The manager explained to me that medium well takes a long time to cook and that's why my new steak was taking so long.. Of course I know that it takes a long time. That's why I was surprised it came out so quick. Terrible service from the manager and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Got take out and spent almost 30 bucks with tip to get a burned sandwich. How did something like this leave the kitchen???"}
{"text":"I never write review for a chain restaurant before but this time I will. I went to this Apple Bee's for a quick lunch. As usual I love to order their sirloin steak. The host forgot to assign a waiter to our table so we have to wait for 15 minutes until we actually got someone to our table. But once he came, he's very polite, apologize for our waiting time and the food came in 5 minutes after we ordered. What make me even more surprise was the manager came into each table and greet us and making sure that everything was okay and we got whatever we need. I definitely satisfied with the service and it leave a good memories. Thanks Apple Bee's for beyond standard service!"}
{"text":"Food at Applebees tis just okay, got their soup and salad which is a good deal.  Caylee was our server and she was great so that is why they got 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Eh, I'll be generous and give it 3 stars.  Applebee's, Chili's, Lone Star, etc.  They're all in this area.  It fills the bill if you'e going to a movie at the nearby Maxi-Saver as my friend Lisa and I were.  They've got a Sizzling Asian Shrimp & Broccoli on their under 550 calorie menu which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Amazing service. The best part of the meal was the appetizer platter. Applebee's always has amazing appetizers! The appetizer consisted of mozzarella sticks, spinach artichoke dip, boneless wings, and quesadillas. After the appetizer I got the chicken fajita roll up. Definitely a good wrap and choice for a sandwich. The restaurant was a little pricey however and didn't seem to have much quality for the price. I'd probably go again just for appetizer and wrap."}
{"text":"The manager, going by the name of Kristy was by far one of the rudest and under cover racist people I've encountered. And if I was a betting women, I'd bet my life she was hitting on a female waitress. I heard most of their conversation. And it was very annoying!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and the food was good; portions have gotten smaller, but the tomato basil soup is great. What kicked it up was our server, Toni; she was outstanding - excellent service!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the portions you get. Slow service and food was underwealming both times I have been there, once for their steak with shrimp and the other for neighborhood burger. They got my order wrong for my burger. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went back for another try. The burger was gross. This restaurant is just bad. I've tried and tried. It's just bad. Has no identity. The food is mediocre at its best. I unfortunately won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a chain, yes, but the food is decent and consistent.  I love the fact that they have healthy options and even have WW \"Points\" listed on certain menu items.    I got the Italian Chicken and Portobello Sandwich and after the initial laughter at my table died down about how small the portion was, I dove in and found it quite tasty.  The side of fruit left something to be desired (a few pieces of apple and 1 strawberry), but I finished the meal satisfied and feeling good about myself.    Kudos to you Applebee's, for making it a little easier to meet people for a quick lunch without having to completely sabotage my diet.  The only reason I'm not giving it more stars is the service - what can I say, it was \"OK\" at best.  But I'll be back for the menu options and cheap eats for sure."}
{"text":"Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night.   My friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20."}
{"text":"I heard someone call Applebees the Walmart of restaurants and I couldn't agree more.   Everybody assumes I would love this place because it has apple in the name and I really like apple themed things. But no. Ugh. Gross. Nothing on the menu is good and the prices aren't even cheap!! I can understand cheap prices for cheap food but the prices are the same as Chilis or TGI Fridays. Except they have good food.  The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever come here is because my boyfriends parents love it. No idea why."}
{"text":"I'm being super super super nice by giving this particular applebees an average \"A-OK\" rating.  When you come visit this restaurant, your experience will be very hit-or-miss.  From what I've come to learn and see, when you visit when it's mildly busy to super busy, the service is HORRIBLE. You get constant neglect and it takes the waitresses an average time of around 15 minutes for them to come back and check on you to see if you need any refills or would like your check.  It really just depends because on the other hand I've had a small few visits here where certain waitress's were fantastic and very attentive.  The food is always usually pretty great no real complaints there. This Apple bee's just really needs to work on evaluating certain employees because for the most part, they suck here I won't even sugarcoat it."}
{"text":"We stopped in this Applebees restaurant on the way home from a soccer game. it was getting close to dinner time and we didn't think the kids are going to make it home without dying of starvation first. So something that they have that is pretty neat are the tablets that are on the tables to which can keep the kids entertained and you can also order appetizers and desserts or it'll messenger server to head back to the table if you need something. however what they don't tell you is ask if your 8 year old child gets a hold of this miracle ordering tablet there are games on this tablet that they will start charging you if your kids play them.    I ordered a 9 ounce sirloin which was cooked well but trimmed poorly. My daughter ordered the smaller sirloin which was not very good.   the manager had to come over and remove C 99 cents charge that was a result of playing the game on the tablet. Overall the food was decent the tablets were all smeared with fingerprints so it seems that some deep cleaning needed to be done."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed to find out they discontinued their signature Riblets but we pushed on and I ordered the rack of ribs with the Honey BBQ sauce & my gal the chicken both were cooked nicely and tasted good, the loaded mashed potato's were too salty to eat but the two blended margaritas tasted good.  The bill came to $60+ for 2 dinners, though the main courses tasted good compared to the bill it left you wondering what you paid for.. the service was good we ordered from the bar.  I think it was a bad business decision to get rid of the riblets being that it was their signature dish, without it they are nothing more than an overpriced burger house that serves liquor. I gave it two stars because I have had ribs & chicken cooked just as well and have paid far less right in the same general area."}
{"text":"I love the food and the service!  We've been coming here for forever and every time we go in Nathan is our server. He's just wonderful. Great customer service! He greets us by our names, and helps us right away. Just awesome.  The food here is great, we never have to wait too long for our food to come out, no matter how busy it is."}
{"text":"That stout gravy steak was delicious.  The new (at least for me it is) gadget at the table where I can pay when I'm done instead of waiting for waitstaff is amazing.  Great staff by the way. Love your potent drinks, too."}
{"text":"My brother and I went out for a little birthday dinner and received the best service we've had in years. The server, Donald, was absolutely amazing! He made us laugh and feel incredibly welcome. I recommend this restaurant only because Donald is awesome....and the food is good. #donaldisawesome"}
{"text":"Eh. I could take it or leave it. Got the 2 for $20 deal which really, truth be known, is a good deal. But I'd be willing to pay more for better food and service.   Our appetizer arrived without plates so my nephew (my lucky dinner partner tonight) and I had to eat them off the plate they were served on. Not a huge faux pas but aren't we supposed to get our own little app plates? It almost felt Neanderthal-ish to dish it up without them.   In the course of eating the appetizer, my nephew's Sprite needed to be refilled. Despite the fact that we set the empty glass on the edge of the table and at least 3 servers (including our own) and a manager walked by, we had to wait until we got our entrees to inform the food runner that we needed a fresh Sprite.   My entree was ok at best. I went with the 3 cheese pasta with chicken and bruschetta tomatoes. The pasta was on the dry side and could have benefitted from just a tad bit more sauce. The real downer was the chicken. It was cold. Not ice cold, mind you, but too cold to be served. My nephew enthusiastically said his entree of macaroni and cheese with bacon and chicken strips was \"really, really good!\" Full disclosure: he's 13 years old and I'm quite certain will eat absolutely anything you put in front of him.   More than halfway through dinner my nephew was finally delivered what should have been that Sprite refill buuuuuut it was actually water. At this point we were almost finished so we didn't even point out the error.   Our server was sweet and was knowledgable in answering the questions I had prior to ordering so she wasn't the problem at all. I think maybe I just selected a blas√© meal in the first place. I will say that the newly (?) revamped menu looks promising so maybe I'll be back to try something else. Or maybe not.   Like I said at the start...Eh. I could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went out for a drink and some appetizers. We are asked if a high top table is okay we say no we'd prefer a booth the greater then proceeds to look frantically for a booth then asks again if a high top is okay again we decline... she finally seats us and then we wait for about five minutes and press the call server button.he comes over asks us for our drink orders we then tell him we'd like to order our food as well.. when the food finally arrives half of it was cold. We had to wait for our server for quite awhile before he came to check up on us. There were only 2 tables on his side so I'm not sure what he was doing. Overall I felt like he could have had better customer service and he could have checked up on his tables more frequently."}
{"text":"Applebee's is usually the place I am for. Get togethers but I not sure anymore,  when my meal came I tried a frie, boy it was so sour, way to much salt with every frie I ate I had to scrub of the salt, also our sever never came back for refills or to ask us if we needed anything. I just hope this is a one time thing"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Applebee's in awhile but remembered it being pretty good. The menu has change since last time I went. The food was pretty good. But the employees and manager were extremely unprofessional. They were all standing on the side of the dinning room joking and laughing in front of all the customer and telling inappropriate stories. I found it quite odd and out of place. I had to wait over 15mins for a waitress to ask if I wanted another drink. I don't think I will be visiting this Applebee's again."}
{"text":"Appetizers came out within 45 min... I forgot I was hungry. The peach tea is gross. I'm going back to Chilli's *still waiting for food like *"}
{"text":"My friend and I have lunch here pretty often.  After today we will be taking some time away. The food is pretty good but some of the new staff have much to be desired. The tables are not clean.  The staff sits around talking while they should be cleaning. Their personal hygiene is not a priority. A young man came to our table to take our drink order.  He looked like a homeless guy off the street."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go tonight since we didn't feel like sitting in; chose the fish and chips (subbed onion rings), steak with fries and grilled veggies, an appetizer of spinach artichoke dip and chicken quesadilla, and just because I hadn't eaten all day, I added a shrimp skewer. When I arrived I was greeted promptly. In fact, if I was judging my experience completely on service and food I would be giving this place five stars. After I arrived I was quickly told that the grilled veggies I had ordered with my steak were no longer available and had been taken off the menu. I DO NOT BLAME THEM for this problem. I do, however, blame Applebee's for not updating their online menu and allowing me to pay extra money for nothing. The people in charge of the to-go order tried everything they could to make it right. They offered me a different side, a double amount of my other side, a drink, a dessert, anything. I actively refused because it was only a couple of bucks, I don't have to pay for dinner that often, and I just wanted my food because I was really hungry. After trying their very best, my food is brought to me by the very apologetic to-go waitress and...I get home and they've forgotten my shrimp. All that fuss over the veggies must have caused it to slip their minds (and, of course, it was my luck that it was the part of the meal I was looking forward to the most). All the rest of the food we got was just wonderful and we made quick work of it. It just irks me a little that instead of just a couple dollars down the drain due to a website error transformed into about seven dollars spent for nothing. Also, again this is in NO way the waitstaff's fault, the to-go pick up area is weird. It's like being invited to go behind the cash registers in a retail store because when you come in through the to-go door you are supposed to stand directly behind the computers used to keep track of to-go orders. You stand in anyone's way that wants to come through that way, and because the computers are faced toward you, that means that any employee using those computers are faced away from you. If you make no noise when you enter they don't see you. It's kind of an awkward placement but the people working here get told where things go so I definitely don't blame them. Like I said, if I was just talking about food and service this would be a five star review, but unfortunately other stuff got in the way of an otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"They provided healthy menu options for sum time now. They now have a very good happy hour for $3.50 two of my favs spinach artichoke dip and the grilled chicken wontons."}
{"text":"Applebee's has ok food, but it's an easy place to meet people and eat and have drinks.    I do love their traditional hot wings."}
{"text":"Wow how Applebee's has went down hill. Only good part of my meal was the celery sticks"}
{"text":"I usually looooove this Applebee's. I'm a regular usually here at least twice a month. Tonight though, ughhhhhhhh-nnoying, our server, Alex was so incredibly inattentive. It took very long to have drinks ordered after being sat. Then I didn't get to start my meal for exactly 1 hour and 2 minutes (I timed it). Also, the water glasses tasted awful and due to how we were NEVER given attention to for over 40 minutes, they stayed at our table until we finally said something. To top it off refills were NEVER offered until after our food came.Even when the food came we were never asked the infamous \"how is everything, ladies.\" Thankfully, Neill Courtney (The Manager) came and explained the entire situation and deducted our bill. Absolutely amazing service on his part."}
{"text":"Service is fine. Had a very good barmaid, but it did not help the food. Wife had a sirloin with garlic shrimp dish and for $15 it was a rip off. Steak was small, frozen and tough even medium rare. Shrimp were warm water shrimp and might have been 70-90 count. I had a chicken dish with mushrooms and it too was terrible. Dry burnt breast with all the cartilage still on it and the sauce/veggies were frozen. Not to mention $5 for a draft bud.....we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great bartender however, my food order was SW Sirloin Salad which I had numerous times and always was one of favorites go to although, the steak had to be remade because it was over-cooked , 2nd time the steak had no flavor and way to much dressing.  Furthermore, sometimes you need to stayed because the atmosphere  was happy and festive and they turn up the  music and just have another Seasonal Octoberfest Beer!"}
{"text":"Can you guys just be a little quick? Who the hell would wait 40 mins on a single burger???"}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour for meal to arrive. Waitress was good but the rest of the staff seemed like they were in slow motion."}
{"text":"I almost feel strange giving this Applebee's a favorable review. Judging from previous reviews local residents hate this place, but I feel compelled to be honest.  We were in town visiting. Decided to have an early Saturday night dinner.  Pleasant looking restaurant.  Inside the air conditioning did catch our attention. 120 degrees outside contrasted sharply with near 70 degrees inside. Brr-rrr-rrrr . . . But that wasn't a negative. Didn't take long to get used to the frigid atmosphere.  After a pleasant greeting we were seated and within minutes our server took drink orders.  Lemonade and ice tea arrived right away. Received a new lemonade from our attentive waitress when my glass emptied.  We ordered Steak and Shrimp combo, Won Ton Tacos and Lettuce Wedge topped with Green Goddess dressing sprinkled with toasted Pecan & Bacon bits. Tasty shrimp. Tough steak. Tacos and lettuce to die for. We'll order the noteworthy appetizers again and again. Nice flavor, fresh and light."}
{"text":"Missed it at every opportunity. We went there today for the 3 o'clock happy hour appetizers. We were (not) greeted at the door by a young girl who said nothing to us as she was getting the menus.     Once we were seated and the drink orders were placed, I looked around and I knew we were in trouble. There were 11 tables seated and only two servers on the floor. The drinks came out and my (Not) iced tea had all of the ice melted in it already. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and my girlfriend ordered two appetizers. As the last words came out of my mouth about my order the waitress clicked her pen and took off before I could ask for more ice.        We waited 25 minutes for the Mac and Cheese and two appetizers to arrive. The order was brought out by the second server who dropped the food and took off once again before I could ask for more ice.       The pasta was warm but way over-cooked and was too soft to serve. The two appetizers came out okay.       We didn't get extra ice or any refills at all because the server never came back. I had to eat my dinner with no drink. I flagged the girl down after I gulped my last bite to get the check and she said we could pay at the table with the Kiosk. She again was rushing off when I yelled back, we are paying cash.      The check finally came and as we were walking out the manager held the door open for us. She watched us stroll out and our exit ended just like our entrance with no greeting  thank you or inquiry about our experience. What a missed opportunity. She actually said nothing to us as we walked by her.     This is the second time I have had a bad experience here and we will not be back to get burned for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"I wrote a very bad review for The Applebees on Eastern in Henderson last year and I haven't been back since. My daughter wanted to go to Applebee's tonight so we went to the one on Warm Springs and Pollock. I ordered the Cedar Salmon and my three year old had the Mac and Cheese off of the kids menu.      When our drinks came, the diet Pepsi was completely flat and gross. I asked the server to take it off the bill and I just drank my water. He took it off and had no followup with me about what he did to correct the problem. I guess the next gut was getting a flat soda too.      The reason I ordered the Cedar Salmon was that the picture looked so appealing. When the  dish arrived it was 1/4 of the size of the picture in the menu (Pictures Attached). I asked the waiter where the rest of my dinner was and he said, \"That's the way it comes\". My daughters Mac and cheese was obviously the box version of Craft Mac and Cheese, because they didn't mix the cheese powder thoroughly and you could see the dry powder on the pasta (Gross).       I am completely done with Applebee's. Every time I go to any location it ends badly."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend and was less than impressed. When we walked in, nobody was there to greet or seat us. Usually when we go to an Applebee's they open the door inside the restaurant for us, but whatever. Maybe they were busy we figured. We waited for about 5 minutes before someone acknowledged we were there and a manager pointed to us to a worker without saying hello or anything. We ordered mango teas that tasted awful. I always ordered mango teas and they're my favorite, but they had no mango flavor and when I asked our server if I could get get more flavor or change to a different drink she implied I wouldn't like them and I just got water. Our food tasted so bland and I asked for extra dressing with my salad upon ordering that I never received. Not satisfied with this place at all and won't be coming back. Shitty service and disappointing food and drink."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Went with a couple of friends and got smushed into a little booth. Got a horrible, rude waitress who didn't let us enjoy our time there and shoved us out the door. I love applebees, but this one has crappy service."}
{"text":"Got seated and sat there for about 15 mins before a very nice girl named meryln came and asked if we have been helped because she noticed we had been sitting there for a while now. We said no so she took our drink order waited another 5 mins .   The food was nothing to go crazy about I had chicken strips and fries my partner had spicy wonton shrimp . She usually finishes her plate and mine but she did not good was not the greatest.  We then sat with no soda in our cups for the whole meal time.  Not the greatest service   Cleanliness - everything looked pretty clean   Service - not good not horrible   Merlyn was very nice she tried maybe at least and we appreciated that. 2 star only for our server."}
{"text":"Our service was ok but the food,all three of our meals were not satisfactory at all. I did complain and they will be sending vouchers out to me that I will probly not even use because I will never go back. Not good Applebee's not good. Food was cold flavorless and disquieting. Save yourself the time and drive past this Applebee's location."}
{"text":"Started with the house salad, loved that, lots of bacon and tomato made it delish, next was the chicken cavatappi pasta dish, loved it! Server very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Me and my Hubs enjoy coming here for little dinners. We ALWAYS get the chicken wonton tacos. They are so GOOOOD!! I got the Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp which was good but I have had it better. I was slightly disappointed with it this time. The hubs got the spinach and artichoke chicken cavatappi pasta bowl. He said he enjoyed it. My daughter got the ribs (as usual) and really enjoyed them. We ended the evening with the triple chocolate meltdown which is a lava cake and vanilla ice cream with a chocolate drizzle. This was definitely the star of the night!!!!! Jenn, a server, is totally amazing. She's the best around."}
{"text":"I am not a picky eater but everything here is so bland and boring. The spinach dip was watery and tasted weird. My pasta needed tons of salt and pepper because it tasted like a Michelina's frozen dinner.  The prices are pretty cheap but you can go elsewhere for food that tastes much better for the same price."}
{"text":"This Applebees locations needs to do something with their 'management' or lack of. We came here for Hispanic Mother's day. Why? I have not clue, mom is a sweetheart and likes the simple things in life. Upon my arrival at 7:30PM I walked in and there was no host/hostess to greet or help me. I waited about 2-3 minutes before someone came over and asked me how many?  No 'hello how are you doing today?' just 'how many today?'. I told her we would be 5 total so she took my name and told me it would be about 10-15 minutes. We were seated around 7:50 so not too bad. While waiting I noticed how many Hispanic families there was in the building(about 90% of their customers). I also noticed many seemed unhappy and there were so many empty tables,but about 15 people waiting to be seated. Clearly whoever is managing this place has no idea when peak days or international holidays/events are. How can you work in the service industry and not know this.  Our waiter Devin came and took our drink order and placed our orders rather quickly. He seemed very flustered and already frustrated because I am sure he was getting many complaints and disgruntled guests. It took our drinks about 10 minutes to get to us. My brother ordered a beer and it came stale, he tried a different one, same exact thing. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes, around 8:35 is when we got them. 2 Salads, 1 order of wings, and 1 order of Mozzarella sticks. We had no silverware, plates, or napkins at our table. I had to wait a couple minutes until one of the wait staff walked by and ask for them. Once we finally got a hold of someone we received our knife and fork wrapped in a regular brown napkin, pretty sloppy.  Our food finally came out around 8:50PM and it was cold, very small amounts of chicken in a pasta, my medium steak was cooked well done and potatoes were cold. I did not want to wait another hour to try and get another steak, instead I had go ask for a steak knife because butter knives aren't meant for steaks, who knew? I tried eating it and couldn't get past the first bite, it was like trying to chew leather.  I almost forgot to mention, when our food was coming out we had set our appetizer bows and plates to be taken away and 3 different wait staff came to our table to bring our food and none of them bothered getting them out of our way so we could eat comfortably. It wasn't until once younger lady stopped by and took them off our table, I didn't get her name, but she was very pleasant and had a nice attitude and apologized about. She also asked us if we needed anything. Once we finally were ready to leave it took us about 15 minute just to get our check and another 10 for our waiter to come and check on us again. Once he finally came in I asked him if he knew what today was and told me, yes, he found out a couple hours prior, but they were not pre-shifted or talked about today, which explains why they were so short staffed on what I assume was a rather busy day for them. There was maybe a total of 40-50 people max in the restaurant all night, but could not even come close to proving decent service.  As I looked around I could see all of the disgruntled and very upset customers. There was no manager anywhere to be found, nobody stopped by and asked how our meal was and if there was anything else we needed, or a simple 'I am sorry, we are short staffed and we sincerely apologize for the long wait times and maybe offer some type of credit or discount for the less than stellar customer service. I talked to our waiter Devin and told him I understand it is not his fault that the manager does not give a damn about its customers and training or supporting their team. I still  None of the wait staff looked happy or like they were a team. I still gave him a $15 tip because I know it is not his fault the kitchen and management is crap and only so much a waiter can do. There is a clear lack of leadership at this location and something needs to be done. There are so many of the same complaints and management is in denial or just turning a blind eye to the problem at hand. I can assure you we will never be returning to this Applebee's and would highly suggest you think twice about visiting this location until it is under new management that cares about its team and customers. If there was a manager on site, they are not fit to be running a restaurant if you can't handle a small holiday like this one."}
{"text":"Not the best experience. I've never like Applebee's, only been 2 times in my life, this was the second time. Hostess was very friendly. Our server Savannah L. Was a different story. She was kinda stuck up and repeatedly told us she would be right back.   We had the cheeseburger egg rolls (good) the steak chili (more like taco sauce and meat, no beans or anything) I had the Mac and cheese (lacking sauce, came with chicken tenders but some wackadoo poured honey mustard all over it) not impressed.   We ate, and paid and for the first time in my life I gave a tip less than 5 dollars (2.50 to be exact)   Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner was seated quickly waitress was right over took our drink orders food came out quickly everything was delicious our waitress was very nice and professional"}
{"text":"We had the 2 for $20.00 meals, my wife had the Pasta in a Bowl and I had the Rib Basket.  My (3) Riblets and fries were skimpy and I would not recommend but the appetizer was good and my wife like her meal.  Service was great, we had Ariel.  If not for the Ribs I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"So I saw the comercial about the all you can eat ribblets and chicken tenders and decided to go and check it out with my mom and my boyfriend at 10 pm on a Wednesday and it turned out to be a very bad decision. Ordered just the 12.99 special for each of us, the ribblets tasted weird to me but I figured that it was ok since my boyfriend was eating them. Everyone finished their protein and half of the fries, we waited about 6/7 min for the waitress to come and  take the refill order (she was busy attending almost 20 customers) we waited 15 min for the order to come out, 3 chicken tenders per plate and 3 small rib racks, I ordered more once the food arrived, it took about 20 min to get to the table anyways, by that time I was full from all the french fries that comes with every plate (the best tasting item), we got home and my boyfriend is so SICK FROM THE FOOD he ate 3 orders of ribblets I thought they tasted weird!!!!!! What a bad night. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY GOING TO THIS PLACE, IF PEOPLE GET SICK IS BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG --THERE IS NO ALL YOU CAN EAT, THEY FILL YOU UP WITH FRIES AND MAKE YOU WAIT FOR SO LONG FOR 3 PIECES OF CHICKEN!! POOR SERVICE BECAUSE IS NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING !!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is very busy on the weekends between 5-9pm - parking lot is always packed and there is at least a 45-60 min wait for a table. Food is decent, service is good but the prices could be better. Run if the mill chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Applebee's, just not this one.  We went a few weeks ago and saw the new burgers that they had.  My husband was excited to try the one with the egg on top.  He gets a super upset stomach if he eats an onions so he asked for no onions.  When he bit into his burger he tasted onion so asked the server if they could remake it.  Then the manager came to talk to him and told him that he was confident that there were no onions in the burger that he had watched it being made, but they would make him a new one.  At this point we felt like children that had been scolded by a parent and he left.  Funny that we hadn't complained that my salad had no dressing and our youngest should have gotten cheese sticks with her meal but instead got French Fries.  We were cutting them some slack because it was a Friday night.  Well by the time the other three of us were done with our meal, our server came and told us his burger would be right out.  He asked if he could just get it to go since we were all finished.  They finally brought it out.  We paid over $50 for a meal for four people (two kids) and got treated like deadbeats.  I wont ever go back to this Applebee's.  What a terrible place."}
{"text":"So I don't usually eat at Applebee's and they reminded me why. Ordered the \"new\" mushroom Swiss burger. I get home, it was a curbside order, the burger looks decent. I start eating it and realized there's nothing on the burger except for the cheese. I call the location and tell them they forgot the mushrooms and was told the mushrooms are ground into the meat. I could not taste them at all if that was true. The burger was horrible, I can't believe they got $10.99 for this trash. Never going to Applebee's again."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience at Applebee's  We love it here, the service is good and the food is better. I could cry just thinking about the Mac N Cheese with bacon and chicken on top. The menu has tons of options and they don't run out of ingredients. Always a good dinner spot!"}
{"text":"I've came here a couple of times. Nothing special here, just another big name franchise. You can tell they try to cater the younger customers. Never been a big fan of this franchise, but will come back to try something new or meet up with someone? Food is usually salty and not much flavor. There is a lot of other options out there for you to try instead."}
{"text":"Met some family members here who were in town visiting. Most of this franchised restaurants are all about the same. Food is basically OK, and has to much salt. Only thing different is their service. There were about seven of us, the service was pretty good. None of us had nothing to complain about. We all ate our meal, and had a good time. Applebee's has never been a favorite of mine, but this location made the experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Wife, Daughter, and Daughter's boyfriend! Yes I said it, Daughter's boyfriend. Well they wanted to meet me for lunch. So they picked Applebee's? I have never been much of a fan of this franchise, I just never liked them. So any who! Daughter and wife shared a two for twenty meal. Daughter had the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne, she actually enjoyed it, I had a taste of it. It wasn't to bad. Chicken was really good, and since she likes bruschetta! This made the plate even more enjoyable for her. Wife was OK with her sirloin steak, and broccoli. Only problem was it had to much salt on both the steak and veggies. The boyfried (we are calling him this as of now) had their Classic Buffalo Wings and fries. Since it was all gone, I guessed he liked them. I had the Provolone-Stuffed Meatballs with Fettuccine, I seen the commercials, so I wanted to try this. It's alright. I just didn't like the mixture of the cream sauce and marinara sauce. Meatballs were very good. Service needs to get better, but overall it was OK."}
{"text":"The food was good, it had a lot of flavor, and the service was great. The manager also called me a rat. 10/10"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Applebee's but met up with friends per their request. Went on a Friday at 2:45pm for appetizers...but ending up getting the two for $20 with the hubs.   We started with buffalo chicken wings, then my hubbys entree was a hamburger and fries with bacon. From the couple of bites I took...I was not impressed. The bacon seemed half cooked, the tomatoes/lettuce were very unappealing visually, the hamburger clearly wasn't quality. (but what do you expect...its Applebee's.)  I ordered the shrimp/fries...totally great if you are craving fried food as I was on this particular visit.   Like Ellen B mentioned...no \"culinary excellence\" here...but that is only to be expected. Overall, not horrible but not fabulous...just \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" ;0)"}
{"text":"Initial Entering restaurant: Unorganized hostess Very nice but they Do not know how to deal with Guests.  They told us it's a 20-30min wait. There is Empty booths that can sit 4 adults and 2 Children in High chairs.  This place is NOT PACKED, not busy, it's Quiet and there Is barely anyone in here.   If there is a problem with Short staff it would be WISE to inform guest Initially so we know what to expect from The service.   The hostess where Very nice."}
{"text":"Horrible service, two girls talking trash, look and laugh. 5 minute wait with several open tables. That was just the beginning, we left before it could get worse."}
{"text":"We frequent this location a few time a year as we live in the area and do a lot of things in the vicinity.  Whenever Ginger Beef is packed, we would come here if we were in a hurry.  The food, although not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination, is edible and takes the hunger away.   Why then you ask that I gave a lowly one star?  Actually I would have given 0 star if I could.  The short of it is that our server, while reaching over one of our group to give an appetizer to another of our group sitting on the other side, dropped mayo on the guy sitting on the outside.  That is going to stain the sweater he was wearing I thought.  I was surprised that the guy that just got his sweater ruined reacted so calmly.  While accidents happen all the time, it is what she did or didn't do that upsets me.  She apologized and gave us napkins to clean up but that was it.  During the entire meal, she continued to serve dishes in the same careless manner over guests sitting on the outside.  It was lucky that no one else had things dropped on them.  Typically, in this type of situation, the server would call the manager/supervisor over at least to apologize and check on the guests, but that did not happen here.  This reflects poorly on management as this type of situations should have standard procedures to make sure the guests are taken care of.  The consensus around the table (there were 9 of us) was that we will not be back to this restaurant with what happened.  Next time, we might drive a bit farther to find something to eat if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food everytime I go. Wait time isn't too long. Sometimes they get busy and the food takes awhile to come out,  but it's worth it. I always get the half rack of ribs, Mac n cheese with bacon, a side salad, and usually some kind of potatoes. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Man! This remodel is awesome!  Bartenders always always always remember our orders and drinks we like.  Thank you to the Management for taking your time to touch tables including the people at the bar and thank you to your staff to always making us laugh and enjoy our time that we spend there.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Got seated by the host, waited for 15 Minutes and had to go find someone to take our drink order. Horrible Horible service. I know Applebees have bad service but this place is the worse."}
{"text":"Well my wife and I used to come here every once in a while for their happy hour, however they just changed their menu and the choices are awful. No more boneless wings on the happy hour menu and the prices increased to boot. The 2 for $20 mwnu continues to be subpar and they even moved some items to the 2 for $25 menu. Needless to say, we will not be back for a while. Nothing there that would keep us coming back like before."}
{"text":"The host & server were so friendly! The manager made his way to our table also just to say hello. All very friendly and great service"}
{"text":"Applebee's is pretty good. Good selections of food. It can be hit or miss with quality of food and customer service, but if you're looking for something to eat and can't decide,  Applebee's may just be the place."}
{"text":"Everyone has complaints about the staff here, but our server was great. She and her brother both work at this Applebee's and they were both pleasant and helpful. Especially considering the size of our table and the complexities when splitting the bill.  Food is average, but that's what I expect from any Applebee's. The beers are cold and the food was warm. What else do you need from a \"neighborhood\" bar and grill?"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Applebee's restaurant, worst customer service. Took 30 minuets to be seated and there were table available. It Took me to call for our waiter to get our order started, they fucked up our drinks I ordered on the rocks Blue agave they gave me a slushy drink, of course they couldn't leave the drinks so they took them? excuse me I didn't fuck up the order you guys did!!! okay that's fine i don't need freebies!  Food was cold I ordered my meat medium and got well done, and the pasta was dry. And now one asked us for a drink refill. But wait they split the bill and we didn't ask for the bill to be split, and still charged me for my cousins drinks ? Okay so if you took it upon your self to split it why would you charge me both drinks? I clearly only had one because no offered me to get another drink !!! And I gave it a one star because I had too but honestly they deserve ZERO STARS   Mind you we were there at 7:30 didn't leave until 10:30 a lil ridiculous if you ask me."}
{"text":"This place is definitly going down hill and resembles a bar, it has too many beer posters cluttering the walls The service is bad, don't hold your breath for drink refills. My wife ordered an ice tea and got a water then politely reminded that she also wanted ice tea. She never got the ice tea however they charged us for it and then a manager had to get involved to delete it off the check. The portions are very small so the \"low price\" value goes out the window when a entree salad is the size of a side salad. Many better choices exist in this area for the same price point."}
{"text":"DJ the bartender is the best. I know it's only an Applebee's but sit at the bar. It's good and reliable."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I went to this location for a lunch date with my friend. We ordered our food and our drinks. After 45mins of waiting for at least our drinks we still didn't have them. I had to ask her again for our water with lemon. She brought it to us, but without the lemon. Then after a hour and half of waiting for our food she came and told us she didn't know what happened to our order it wasn't made. She asked us again what we wanted to eat. I also asked her to put the food on separated receipts because we were paying separate. She put it all together. When she asked us for anything else. I asked her if we could at least have a free drink for being there for so long and everything getting messed up. She said no. I will not go there ever again. WORST experience."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, staff is pleasant. Nice environment as well :)"}
{"text":"The food has certainly improved since my last visit but what disgusted me was the service that we received from Ashley. After ordering ginger ale she tried to give me the bar's cheap alternative to it without letting me know (soda water with a splash of coke) ok.foul tip. After asking for 7up, she gave me Sierra mist without telling me. I then asked for an ice tea in hopes that there would not be any more misunderstandings(3rd times a charm). A little Communication goes a long way and I would just  like to receive what I ask for,instead of having an alternative chosen for me. The icing on the Crapplebee pie was that she had to  correct the bill after our party was charged for appetizers individually vs.(The way we ordered them) The pick your meal deal."}
{"text":"Arrived at this location at 1:15pm on a weekday. Was promptly seated and the host let us know that all burgers were $7 today. Definitely a good deal and my wife and I decided to take advantage of that.  Service was a little slow, and even worse, the server was stacking orders. He took 4 tables orders and then put them in after taking all 4.  A big no no in food service industry.  It took over 40 minutes to get a couple of burgers.  After we ate quickly, we received the bill and the burgers were rung in at full price.  I flagged the waiter and let him know of the error.  The manager comes out and says that the burgers are not $7.  I said to go ask your host what he said.  He does not and wants to argue instead and says that that promotion is on a different day.  I asked again if he was going to ask his host and he said no, but he would adjust the price down.  As a manager, leader, you need to stand behind your employees, even if they make a mistake."}
{"text":"We been sitting here for almost 1hr and 30 mins and they havnt served our food !!!! And other ppl been here less time and already got our food. They told us they got a new employee cooking and he sucks but that's not our fault they told us we would get a discount it better ne like a 50% discount"}
{"text":"This Applebee's is about standard for any other Applesbee's. We went for lunch on a Thursday and it was about 90% full at 1 in the afternoon. We were seated quickly close to the bar area. Our waitress was very attentive, a little too chatty sometimes but was on par with refills. Food came out quickly and hot! Drink prices were ridiculous. We ordered two sweet teas and we paid $6 a tea. Overall if you do the 2 for $20 it's not a bad deal. The location surprises me as it's kind of away from the rest of the chain style restaurants on the west side. More power to them to draw people to Whitney Way though."}
{"text":"This place needs some help!  Service sucks, appetizers come out 45 minutes after ordering with 1 meal!!  They were ice cold!!  Server got upset when we asked the meal come out with the other 7 meals.  Had to beg to have dirty glasses removed from the table.    Manager was no help."}
{"text":"Went to applebees to wait for a appointment we were to early for. We went straight to the bar and sat. In front of my seat on the bar was a big puddle of brown liquid not a good start. The bartender was very pleasant and said she would clean the puddle. She made my husband and I a drink and never cleaned the mess.  We sat and visited and my husband said I needed to drink up it was time to go. The next thing I hear is what the h*ll. I look at my husband and he is pulling something out of his mouth it was glass. It cut the roof of his mouth and tongue. The bartender came over and saw the glass and my husbands tongue bleeding. She got manager and he saw the glass was chipped . He said he would cover our drinks and asked if we needed to file a report. We were so done and just walked out. If my husband would of swallowed glass it could have been really bad. This place is not clean or caring . Avoid!"}
{"text":"Boy, this location keeps worse each time we come here. Do not come in here after 11:30 pm even on an evening when open until 1 am and expect good and proper  food orders."}
{"text":"This chain has gotten heavy handed on the salt. They will kill someone someday. It's not just this store of the chain."}
{"text":"Went with my son and a friend of ours on a weekday night. It was Nov. 3rd to be exact. First of all the menu doesn't have as many good selections as it used to. I just wasn't in the mood for anything on the menu and I used to love going to AppleBee's. Our waiter came and right away I felt as though I was bothering him. The impression we received is (I have a lot to do hurry and tell me what you want). This is the first review I am giving on yelp, yet realize this has to be read by the establishment (or so I would hope) and they then can work on what needs to be improved. About half way through the meal I don't know what happened but the waiter became friendlier which was nice. The appetizers were good though. The main point of my review is to let servers know to please treat customers friendly from the beginning to end. I am sure they work hard and the customers who came in most likely worked hard all day as well. As for the menu well I probably won't ever go to an Applebee's again. Food selection wasn't good."}
{"text":"I went there for my daughter's birthday. The food was great. The waitress were friendly. They sang for my little sweet daughter. It was the best dinner ever."}
{"text":"Not bad for an Applebees around this area. Since my cousin saw a special of \"ALL YOU CAN EAT RIBLETS FOR $12.99\" she decided to invite me and my brother for dinner.   Man, I haven't had Applebees for over 10 years now. Since the Applebees near my house closed down, we decided to choose this location since we need to do some shopping around here.  As we went in, we waited a minute for someone to greet us and take us to our table. We were taken in and sat in a booth. We took a look at the menu and saw the special of unlimited ribs. A few minutes later, our server came and welcomed us, asked us what we like to drink. And out to get our drinks. As she came back with our drinks, we might as well order.  We ordered: 2 X Honey BBQ Unlimited Riblets, french fries, and coleslaw 1 X Spicy Texas BBQ Unlimited RIBLETS, french fries, and coleslaw 1 X Mac N Cheese  About 10 minutes later, our food came out hot. Of course, I took some of the photos of the food and it looks delicious. We ate our portion of the food, me and my cousin had the Honey BBQ and my brother had the Spicy Texas.  The Honey BBQ tasted so good and very delicious. It did however had small bones in the ribs which you have to be careful of. The fries were very good no complaints of. Since I haven't had coleslaw for a while, I decided to try it and man, it taste delicious.  As for the Spicy Texas, my brother's portion, I tasted a little bit of his. His portion tasted ok, it didn't have any spicy taste to it and kind of tasted plain. I even gave my brother my portion of the Honey BBQ, and he loved it so much that he was jealous.  As for the service, it was good. Our server, I forgot her name, responded quickly and asked us if we wanted any refills for our drinks or if we wanted seconds for our ribs. Very nice and respectful server."}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews, but I was so uncomfortable the last time I ate here. Usually the service is okay and there have been times the food was not fully cooked but the management has always been quick to respond and I appreciate that. However, the last time my boyfriend and I went to dinner, we were served by a talkative waitress on a slow night who only had to go back and forth between our table and a table a few booths behind us. She was talkative, loud, and very nice to both our table and the one back. We could easily hear the conversation she was having with the table in the back and I'm sure they could hear ours with the waitress. This waitress talked about her daughter between both our tables and that's when shit hit the fan. She went on this homophobic rant about gay people and how she's never let her daughter be gay and how she thinks it's ridiculous that we have so many gay people in the media. I have a boyfriend but I am not straight. I was so disgusted that a waitress would go on such a bigoted rant in front of customers. As someone who works in service, I have my opinions and I keep them to myself in order to ensure my customers are comfortable and happy. She can have her opinions but not in the company of customers ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS WHO BELONG TO THAT SAME  LGBT* COMMUNITY THAT SHE LOUDLY SHAMED. Management should really have a conversation about professionalism and sensitivity with their employees."}
{"text":"Had an Applebee's gift card to use up, so stopped by for lunch with my 4 year old granddaughter. She had the kid's meal chicken fingers, seasoned french fries, and a box of apple juice (normally $4.99, but because this was a Tuesday it was only $0.99). It was OK, just average. I had the lunch combo special for $6.59. My choice was a turkey breast sandwich and an oriental salad with fried chicken tenders. It was OK, just average for flavors and portion size.  At 11:45 am we were seated promptly and our server was terrific. The food arrived promptly. Parking is close to the door."}
{"text":"Applebee's just underwent a major revamp of the menu so I thought this would be a good time to update my review. The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse.  I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy.  Overall, the meal was a great value. I just question whether the Valley needs yet another steakhouse chain."}
{"text":"Been here before more than a few times. Each time the service is a little worse. Every time we come here they don't have any tables available, and the hostess has to go clean off a table. Yet there are few clean tables but no one is sitting there. Wtf???   I noticed that they do not have bus people here..the waiter or hostess is running around going it all.   Tonight..had to wait again to get a clean table. Then no silver ware. Asked the waitress..nothing. The apps come out...uh we need silver ware and plates. She brings the plates, but only two sets of silverware...there is 3 of us! 45 min and still no dinner food.   Now also the 2 for $20 has become 2 for $25. We'll be going to Chilis going forward plus they have the rewards so usually a free desert or app or drinks."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we patronized this Applebee's. We have had bad experience a few years ago. We went there the other day and was served by Josh who was pleasant. The food we ordered was delicious. My fave was the pretzels appetizer. The Manager on duty came by to our booth and say hi. We had a very nice night at this location. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Trust me. Go to Chili's.  It took an hour and 10 minuets to get our food. Plus the 5 minuets to be seated even though it wasn't even busy. Food was sub par. I'm gonna give the one on the East side a shot just to be sure but I'm pretty sure I'll be going to Chili's next time I want a cheap kinda healthy night out."}
{"text":"I'll never go there again. At times the food is served cold and the service is slow. I remember during happy hour a bartender (Not Mike or Joey) broke a glass cup on the counter above the ice. Instead of cleaning and removing the entire ice box he only cleaned up the large pieces. He continued serving drinks to customers using the same ice. I had to complain to another employee before he finally removed the ice from bar. If you have a stomach ache after a night of happy hour now you know why."}
{"text":"Came for dinner, it happened to be late night happy hour. Food was yummy as always we got wonton tacos, fiesta lime chicken & fries. The manager (missed his name) was friendly and seated us quickly. Our waitress Keren was amazing ! She was very attentive and nice. Overall great experience his Applebees is always worth the drive. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Some of this review is in regards to this location and some of it is in regards to applebee's in general.  First, I stopped going to this particular restaurant because it had become grungy, and gross. They always play music WAY too loud. I like to talk to the person or people I am dining with. service is sloppy. The last few times we went the tables have been sticky. The carpet looked like the floor of a new york taxi.  As to applebee's in general. They change the menu often but everything just has no punch, no wow, no \"I have to have this again\". They push drinks and deserts to the point of being obnoxious.   We were given a gift certificate to here, and gave it to some people we know who are not as picky as we are. They were not impressed either.  On a side note, you have to wonder how a location with consistently bad reviews seems to get occasional 5 stars. Shill much maybe?"}
{"text":"We love the happy hour specials and there dinner. We come here often roughly about three times a month. The food is always good here. Today's service was awful! We came, got greeted by the host asked for a booth there was no one ahead of us, two other couples came in after us also were greeted and got there names put down on a sheet. We were never asked for our names. He then sat a couple before us on a booth . I went up to the host let him know my name and reminded him that we were before the couple and I wanted a booth. He then told me \" it's going to take a minute.\" He then called up the other couple and sat him down on another booth. So then a family of 7 walk in and they wait a few minutes and get seated so now we're the last ones to get seated.. I then ask him for the hosts name he says and points to the seat and said have a set, I then asked him kindly again for his name he said \"Curtis\". That was very unpleasant it made the vibe very uncomfortable. The meals and drinks were great once again, but this service was very poor. I also let the manager know she said \"she would take care of and they have a specific procedure.\" I'll go to another Applebee's next time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is rated so low, I've been here twice and the service is excellent. Sure the food is not the greatest but I didn't expect the greatest, after all it is Applebee's not some high end restaurant. The prices are fair and you can see they operate as a team which speaks volumes. I sat at the bar both times and the bartender Jordan really made me feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, Sunday evening, May 21 at the Greentree location. It was like the server was testing us to see if she could get us to leave, so we did! Tons of empty tables, but we were seated in the far off corner next to a broom and bucket, that were set IN the walkway of the dining area. Gross. But it was the reaction of the waitress when I asked that the tv sound be lowered that caused us to walk out. TVs were all over the place, not just at the central bar. We could hardly hear ourselves think with the TV blasting commercials. According to our server, ALL restaurants are now like this and we better get used to it. She smugly added that once the game on tv ended and the music began, it would be even louder. She seemed to delight in making things as difficult for us as she could. So we left. And we'll never go back."}
{"text":"Yes, yes I am really giving it a 5 star rating. First off let me start out by saying we had a $10 buck gift card and that is really what prompted the visit.   I ordered the clubhouse grill with no bacon. It has turkey and ham with a BBQ sauce. I wasn't expecting it to be a melt but it hit the spot. Managed to take a picture.  That and fries with two sides of ranch and I was in heaven. My husband had the endless soup and salad lunch special. First up for him was French onion soup and a spinach and shrimp salad. Next the chilly and an Asian chicken salad. Both were great and although we had not planned on getting desert our awesome waitress who filled my water glass a million times without me noticing talked us into brownie bites for 99 cents. So cute these small triangle brownies and one scoop of ice cream. I wish I would have remembered my camera. The place was clean the food was good and the service was great!  I wasn't expecting to give it 5 stars but it really couldn't have gone any better. Delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the nicer Applebee's ive been to but an Applebee's is an Applebeee's right? Service was okay, nothing above average. Food was good as usual."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I ate here. For some reason, I just wanted to eat there and now I regret it. First it was Sunday at 7:30 and the restaurant had 15-20 people.  No one came after we walked in. Odd to hear the hostess who sat us mentioned our server's name and the manager in case we had any problems !!! that was a warning already. I never had someone mention the manager at the beginning.  The food...cold fries, baby back ribs were overlooked dry and looked like it had been re-heated not fresh :(...the server did bring us freshly cooked fried. My husband had 4 cheese macaroni with chicken tenders. it was over poked almost most burnt and hard to chew. macaroni was ok.  Very disappointed we told the server and she took the plates back because we barely touched the food. The Manager spoke to us and apologized and offered us to choose something else. we kindly declined and the manager took care of the bill. I hope they turn it around and prepare fresh cooked food rather than reheated."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch Fri 3-9-18 approx 2 p.m.  There were approx 5 other tables with guest.  I ordered a margarita, it came in a tall narrow glass with nothing around the rim.  Our waiter had a hard time understanding our order, 2 salads, dressing on the side.  Our meals arrived & we waited 5 minutes for silverware. The waiter blamed it on the hostess.  You can pay at the table, but your receipt prints at the bar.  After waiting & waiting for the receipt we left without it!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Not so hot. We ordered an appetizer no sooner do I take a bite here comes our meals. Mt food was ok. My wife didn't fair as well. She ordered a steak medium, it came well done. Sent it back it took lonfer the secound time to cook less. So she ended up not eating."}
{"text":"Normally, I am not a fan or chains, but I am going to give this place a good review because of it's location in Irwin.  There are not many places like this at all in Irwin and I give them props for being the first to land in the town.  It is a normal Applebee's as you would expect so your average chain restaurant, but for a town full of fast food and sit down restaurants like Denny's, I would say that this is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Actually went last night as we are frequent visitors and as usual, Service and Food was on point!  We've given up on all the other national chains because of bad service and terrible food but this Applebee's is always just right.  Thanks to our favorite Applebee's guy, Captain Aaron For great drinks and superhero service.  See you next week!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. The happy hour was great, I got a coronarita and boneless wings. Tricia was exceptional, she had refills on everything before we even had to ask."}
{"text":"I am beyond upset. We stopped at Applebees, after an incredibly long day, around 7:00 PM. We decided to eat in the bar area to save time and get home. Boy what a mistake!!! Ordered a glass of wine for me and a beer for my fiancee. I also ordered water with lemon. Took 15 minutes to get our drinks and the water - No Lemon. We waited another 10 minutes for the server to take our order. Only burgers. We did not get our food for an hour and 15 minutes. Were told that because I ordered a quesadilla burger and the 1st attempt didnt make it they had to remake it. Really? An hour and 15 minutes to make 2 burgers? I also ordered mine with some pink, mine was raw in the middle. By the time we got them, i didnt care. Our server Marcus was very nice and we asked to speak to the manager. He finally made it over after tripping over a chair. Came to the table and did nothing. We werent comped anything! An hour and 15 minutes, 2 burgers, 2 beers, 1 glass of wine and $60 later, we left. Asked for a to go box, never came. Wrapped up my left over in napkins and made it home finally at 9:15. It was a horrendous night. Will NOT go back!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried to call to order to go but we got hung up on. So when we got there we were directed to go to the carside window but they were closed, so we had to order @ the bar. The wait was sooo long that we ordered a drink to wait, but that was too long of a wait as well. Hope our order comes to us correct! Ho hum! We're tired!"}
{"text":"Well the host was cheery & our waitress seemed quite patient although we already knew what we wAnted. LOL Now let's see how well they do us over here shall we? Although this place didn't quite make our usual like the other place we usually go to but my Rhoda sure enjoyed the playlist that they played tonight!"}
{"text":"First time @ this location although we can say that we are regular Applebee's customers. We should've sat @ the bar because we ordered the spinach dip w/chips & mango margaritas. The service was ok"}
{"text":"This Applebee's is great! I've been to others, and I judge them by the steak. At this Pineville location the steak is always exactly like I ask for it. They cook the best steak! It's a good and a bad though because I expect this kind of excellent perfectly prepared steak at other Applesbee's locations - no luck. This is the Diamond of Applebee's other locations don't compare (concord location near exit 36 - their cook needs to learn from the one in Pineville)"}
{"text":"Dont come here everything from the food to the service is nasty.  From the manager to the hostess and dont want to get me started with our server."}
{"text":"We used the be regulars but they have terrible service now. Bartenders are all new and don't know what to do. This Adriana chick has three customers and is terrible. She doesn't know how to take care of few customers she has but can dance and run to vape.  Service has gone done and managers don't deserve anything to improve either. Won't be returning with Adriana working to give her a third opportunity take my money else where!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I got carside to go so I figured if the same thing happens twice it must be the norm. The person who delivered our food to the car was very friendly! I was a little nervous about the food because we got burgers so I figured they might get soggy had they been sitting for awhile before we got there but when we got home everything was really good! I've never eaten inside but the food carside has always been good so we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, I love Applebee's. I've been to this one, many times, I just never got around to reviewing them. But overall, I love the place, I love the food, I love the service.   I learned, to get the best out of the restaurant, is to go during the down time. Mainly right after the lunch rush, and before the dinner rush. You get the best service during those time. Even though I do believe that they do give good service through their shift. I believe that your best choice, is going during down time. Since they seem less stressed and more relaxed, that you will see the energy, when they come up and serve you.   I love their Mudslide, its a drink that I'll always get. They do have a wide selection of food, but we just came in for dessert this time around. We had this dessert that had Oreo Cookie on it, and it was delicious. The soft chewy cookie on the bottom, topped off with two scoops of ice cream, decorated with whip cream, hot fudge and Oreo cookie crumbs. It was presented very well, and scarfed down very quickly.   Now, I recommend the dessert, and the mudslide. I for one love the food they have to offer, and I love the service. Just keep in mind, if you do go here, maybe try going during their down time, and I'm sure you'll see the difference. Even though you'll probably good service either way. You tend to get your food faster, their attention a more and you would really feel that energy."}
{"text":"Take your time and money elsewhere. Stopped in on the way home from Vegas yesterday. It was 11:30 and although I hated being that guy that comes in 30 minutes before closing time, we were starving and had to. The staff at Applebee's took a new approach to how to treat customers who walk in a little before closing... They ignored us. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes, making eye contact with multiple staff members. Soon enough we had it and walked over to the bar and grill next door, who was more than happy to serve us and take our money!  Will never go back to this location, let alone any other Applebee's."}
{"text":"Surprising the Roma Pepper Steak was delicious. Waiter knew how they made their steaks  and ensured I would get medium rare, the red tomato topping added a good tangy taste. Red potatoes were soft and great. Portobello mushroom with artichoke cheese spread good also. I enjoyed the plate."}
{"text":"great food, awesome service, excellent prices. i just wish the music was free for everyone to select and not some \"free app\" with overpriced music to play app!"}
{"text":"My mother and I went here for lunch yesterday.  Not crowded at all at 12:45pm.  We got the '2 for $20' deal which is always what I end up getting at Applebee's.  Large, tasty portions on the entrees, large hot vegetable sides.  Very good service.  Honestly the only thing that I could complain about is that the table could have been cleaned a little better before we sat down."}
{"text":"I really dig their two-person specials with dessert for like $20. Their cheese and broccoli soup is super creamy. They have every flavor of tea imaginable so when I come here, I make mine pomegranate.   Our waiter was chill. I ordered \"penne\" and explained that saying it makes me laugh because while it's pasta in Italian, it also means \"dick\" in Spanish at which he laughed and went and told everyone who works in the back.   Well, everything's filling. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Although I have eaten at this chain many times, this recent visit was the best.  The 9 Oz Sirloin was grilled to perfection and the veggies & baked potato along side just as good.  Service 9 out of 10.  Very attentive.   Tip: Get there at 3:00 pm and Miller Lite on tap is only $3.  Yay!"}
{"text":"The reviews are on point! By far the WORST Applebee's experience EVER!! I did read the reviews but the place was recommended by a friend so I thought I'd give it a try. We got seated fairly quickly so I was hopeful but I realized it's because nobody comes here. I've never been to an Applebee's happy hour that was dead.  I waited over 5 minutes for beer and had to remind the server that I ordered it.Appetizers  were not brought out at the same time. Our friends got their wings before us. Not to mention they totally forgot about our Mozzarella sticks. Had to remind the server about those after our meals were brought out. Which also weren't brought out at the same time. The food was bleh. Waited over an hour for a sandwich!  There was no silverware on the table so when we asked for silverware the server said the had no rolled silverware. She threw napkins & silverware on table. Really? They couldn't have rolled the silverware? It's not like it was busy. I waited so long for my second beer that I actually had to go to the bar to ask for it. By far hands down the worst Applebee's experience ever! Do not waste you $ on this poor establishment."}
{"text":"This place is trash  I'd rather eat McDonald's. Staff is rude Food is awful My daughters highchair was filthy, I asked for a new one and was told that was the only one.  I had to ask for a refill 4 times, never once did my waiter do it without being asked. Never was offered to go boxes or even got our check. We were expected to pay at the little tablet thing I assume.  Waste of $50"}
{"text":"Rachel was the best!!! She had to wait several tables because it was short staff but she made sure we were good and keep us entertained. Thank Rachel for being great and an amazing host!!!! I would give you 10 STARS if I could."}
{"text":"The absolute WORST! Food is absolutely horrible.  They brought used(filthy) app plates to the table!!!! Soggy salad.  Greasy burger.  Ugly people.  TV playing football so loud x 10 you couldn't hear yourself think."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always come here because it is our favorite! The Honey BBQ Wings with ranch are on point and are only 5 bucks during happy hour! The steak is always amazing, we got sauteed mushrooms on the side, I got the fish and chips and it was so delicious. The coleslaw that comes with it as a side was probably the best I have ever had. Come here if you want good food and great service! Linsey was our waitress and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. The food has gone down in quality in the past few months.  Not sure if management has changed or what has happened.  Staff is usually friendly but it seems they are understaffed."}
{"text":"And I go to Applebees I always order the steak and shrimp parmesan and it did not disappoint this time I enjoyed almost everything about my experience there our waitress was nice and she didn't come over too many times but she always was capable of being around when we needed her the food was really good my only issue was my drink my margarita was extremely extremely salty I wouldn't recommend a margarita there but I have had other drinks that were much better"}
{"text":"We wanted to take my kids out to dinner this weekend and stopped at Applebees since it was pretty empty. After the hostesses treated us rudely and skipped over us SEVERAL TIMES, seating groups of people who had the same number of us and arrived well after us, my boyfriend commented and we promptly left. This is both the smallest and most unfriendly applebees we've been to. There are plenty of other places to eat down the street. No wonder they weren't so busy on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Stopped here after church with ten women who Worked our server Alexandria B!.....I mean worked her, but she was patient and kind through it all....Thanks Alex !"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this location a handful of times a year. Let me just start with the food was great. The service was terrible. Our server, Shelbi, was pre occupied with the table behind us. She only delivered our initial drink order and a water refill. Two different servers delivered our appetizer and entrees. She never once checked to see if the food was ok. We ordered drink refills from the new table ordering system and had to ask another server to get the refills. We had to ask the manager for more napkins.The server  stood at the side station and sat with the table behind us while we sat with empty drinks. We ended up paying on the new table computer and she is lucky she got a 10 percent tip. My husband and I are both in the business so we understand if a server is busy. She was not. Let me reiterate... Service was terrible and this wasn't the first time."}
{"text":"I just left and man the server was so horrible!  I don't want to be mean or rude but I find when I have older server's they don't \"hear\" you good. I came to relax and enjoy a nice margarita with my meal. Ugh! I eas seated server took ten mins I gave her my order and waited another 15 mins for my appetizer to come still no drink ::Sigh:: couple min later drink comes..and eww the glass was sticky and dirty I had to pour my drink in the martini glass? Ok?  Serving a margarita in a martini glass?! Whatever .. let it slide.. then I'm sipping and then I swallowed something strange.. I called the server over she doesn't even seem to care nor believe I swallowed a strange object that was in the glass I had to ask her to bring me a new drink with a CLEAN glass.. another couple mins ..new drink. Glass is still dirty I had to wipe myself!  And its already been 40 mins no food call over the manager explains what happens. . Dude pulls server she didn't \"hear\" my entree... great! At this point I lost my cool i just decided to pay for the lousy margatini lol whatever that thing was and my appetizer . At least the manager just told me it was no charge for it. I would avoid going here lol I should of went to like native new yorker or chipolte. Sucks laveen has no nice restaurants"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon and was seated with my party of 4 in 2 minutes. We were greeted by our server Jorge a few minutes after that.   So far so good, quick and friendly.  We ordered and waited about 20-25 minutes for the food. I ordered the shrimp combo and it didn't look anything like the menu picture (does anything ever look as good?).   My only real complaint about the food is that the rice pilaf was a little hard, but it was hardly noticeable under the flavors of the scrimp scampi (buttery and delicious). The fried shrimp was good, and the cocktail sauce on the side made it great. This was no bland or boring cocktail sauce but had a nice kick to it.   Overall the meal was better than I expected (from reading some of the previous reviews) and Jorge was the perfect kind of waiter (there when you need him but not hovering).  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We came here last night and there were at least 10 tables open that we could see. There were people waiting in the lobby and we were confused since there were so many tables open. The hostess comes up to me and asks how many. I asked if there was a wait and she said yes and I said why there are so many tables open and she said the kitchen is backed up.... at 630 on a Friday night?! We didn't bother staying. Last time we come here."}
{"text":"I'll give it 2 stars cause our server was awesome. The food on the other hand was not good at all!!! It was just like getting the last of food left for the day. To start off our appetizer onion rings were over cooked, my husbands steak was over cooked as well, his mac and cheese that he paid extra for was rubbery. All in all Ithe food was dried not very appetizing"}
{"text":"My folks love this place and I can't imagine why.  I had the chicken wrap and it could not hold a candle to the wraps at the Great Dane. The fries are so overly seasoned they are almost impossible to eat without a huge glass of water.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch at 1245 on a Wed. Place was packed and the wait was longer then expected but well worth it! My waitress was Alyssa and she was on cue throughout the entire meal! Excellent job!   I ordered the Roma Steak medium rare w/ a stuffed Portabella Mushroom. The food was expertly prepared and delicious! This is not a steak house and yet they out shined Black Angus of Chandler by a mile!! Highly recommend them if you're on that side of town.   The manager even came over to greet me and ask how the experience was- now I really don't care for that but there were a number of patrons that did appreciate his attention. After reading some of the other reviews- I think they've heard the issues and have attempted to correct them."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out / 2 for $20.    Person taking order was very nice - food was good. My only issue is the pick-up process.  When I walked in to a crowded lobby (on a Saturday night) I asked about where to pick up a carry out.  I was directed to stand in front of a sign on the wall at the far end of the bar (where the service staff work, enter orders and exit the kitchen.  VERY busy area !  This is where I waited...paid and received my order.  I felt like I was in everyone's way...especially when a second person joined me to pick up a second order.  This place really needs a designated pick-up location.  (plus some better flow in their lobby)"}
{"text":"So, first off. Not only did it take an hour to get ONLY our appetizers but when we finally got our drinks, the sweet tea wasn't sweet at all. Second, the waitress was very rude and seemed like she did not care much to serve us as she would go walk around the restaurant instead of putting our orders in. Third, it took 45 minutes to come back and tell us they didn't have pasta for one of our meals, NEVER come to this Applebee's!"}
{"text":"I wish I expected a better meal, but I don't. Food was fair, service was good. Dirty utensils and plates. The atmosphere is claustrophobic. All the seating is so close together."}
{"text":"Last night was the worst take out experience I have ever had. Applebee's in Monroeville, used to be an okay chain restaurant that you knew wasn't great but was convent and always knew what to expect. We loved the take out from Olive Garden and thought to try Applebee's. WHAT A MISTAKE !!   It was easy to order online and I truly expect something much better then what we received. It was cold and horrible. Online order said 20 mins to pick up and we left in plenty of time to make sure everything was hot when we got it home.   We ordered the Stir Fry Dinners, one Beef and one Shrimp and a tender basket with fries and Mozzarella sticks. Okay I didn't expect much for those the sticks and I wasn't disappointed was exactly what I expected. I son couldn't finish the fries. Fries I guess are the worst thing to order out they don't travel well.   The orders came in huge boxes that made everything so unappealing. and COLD. A smaller box would have helped in the appealing factor. I receive more in a Chinese take out order then, that they gave.   I don't recommend and will never order again from Applebee's  I will continue with OLIVE GARDEN !!"}
{"text":"Husband & I both ordered the Shrimp & Parmesan Sirloin (its my fave) well done. Mine came and was fine, his cut had quite a bit of fat on it; he cut about half of his steak off before he found actual meat. Wasnt going to complain. Server (Nadine, very nice) asked if everything was good, he let her know it could be better because of all of the fat in his cut. She gets the manager (Marty, also very nice) and he has the kitchen make husband a brand new steak. 2nd one was fantastic.  Obviously mistakes and mishaps are going to happen occasionally, nobody's fault thats life, but their willingness to correct the situation was greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"Applebee's will never get old! Great service nothing too hyped from it but That 2 for 20$ deal is awesome! This time I ordered the artichoke spinach dip! Amazing!! For my main meal I ordered the 3cheese chicken pasta! Very good! To accompanied my meal I ordered a Long Island iced tea :)"}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  My sister, nephew, and I went to Applebee's on Tuesday night for a quick bite to eat. We arrived around 6:45 pm and were told that it would be a few minute wait to be seated. Within a few minutes the hostess came by to seat us.  Our server greeted us promptly and told us she would be back in a few minutes to take our drink orders. Since we were short on time we had our entr√©e's selections ready when our server returned. We all ordered Pepsi to drink. My sister and I ordered the sirloin with a loaded mashed potatos and rice. My nephew had the classic burger with fries, and we shared honey  BBQ wings for an appetizer.  About 10 minutes passed, before our server brought our drinks to the table. The Pepsi tasted flat so we asked our server for a different drink selection, Sierra Mist. Another 10 minutes passed before  our server brought our soft drinks to the table, however the Sierra Mist was also flat. So we opted for water.  Another 12 or 15 minutes pass before our appetizer was brought to the table. The honey bbq wings were drenched in bbq sauce, soggy, and just didn't taste good.  We wait  some more, and finally our entr√©e's arrive.  I notice that the loaded mashed potato were not hot, but only a bit warm and the rice is crunchy and over cooked. The steak that I ordered medium rare is more like well done, dry, and lacked any seasoning. My sisters entree was as bad as mine and my nephews burger was absolutely dry and lacked and type of flavor.  Our server does not come back for quite some time. Again we are in a hurry.  I try to eat my meal, and I actually finished about 1/3 of my entree when I decided to just pay my bill and leave. Finally, our server comes back, asked if my nephew still wanted a refill on his drink that we ordered 20 minutes prior, or if we wanted take out boxes for our entr√©e's.  I replied no, to the refill, and no to boxes.  This by far was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time."}
{"text":"Courteous staff but confusing happy hour. I went online to see what cocktails were included and the price. They differed greatly from the website. The manager explained I must go to the franchises own website to see what's available. That's too much work, one price no matter the location. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"If I could give this particular Applebee's 0 stars I would. We've been there several times and each time we left disappointed. The last time we visited this place it was so bad, we vowed NEVER to go back there again. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table but that wasn't our main complaint. It was a weekend, Saturday night to be exact, so we expected a wait. Once we were seated, we realized we were seated across from a family with a few unruly kids. No biggie because it happens from time to time. What really angered us was our scatter-brained waitress. She was totally inept. She couldn't even get our drink order right. That was our first sign that we weren't going to have a good meal. We ordered flavored lemonades. I asked to have mine with no ice. She returned with the drinks and I had gotten the wrong flavor and it had ice in it. I pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back. When she arrived for the second time, she had the flavor right but there was ice in it again. I decided to just let it slide. We ordered our dinners waited, and waited, and waited. It must have been 30 - 35 minutes before it came. She set our plates down and scurried off. She never even gave us silverware or napkins. We managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins. She went to go get them and never returned. After about 10 minutes a man came around checking on each table. I assumed he was a manager. We told him about the silverware and napkins and he apologized and brought them right away. At this time the bungling waitress comes over to ask if we needed anything. At that point we didn't. She went over to the next table and they complained about something and we heard her apologizing. She went to another table and they complained and we heard her apologizing again. Apparently she was screwing up orders at every table. We finished the meal, paid, and left without tipping. Be aware of this particular Applebee's because they always seem to have issues."}
{"text":"It was a very nice meal and it went above my last experience with Applebee's. The only reason for not a 5 star is the service because the server was awful. Other then that it was a great meal"}
{"text":"This is our neighboorhood applebee's.  We enjoy taking them up for the kids eat free Wednesday's.  The carside to go is always nice as well for the nights when you just do not feel like cooking.  Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Spoiled brat I am! When I come to this Applebee's I get nothing but fantastic service. The food is quick and delicious. Service is usually very prompt, and cooked to perfection! Thanks Courtney behind the bar at night! Thanks Nathan R for customizing my orders just for me! (Picky & in the industry!)  see you guys soon! Gina"}
{"text":"I usually go to Applebee's for happy hour and apps ! Can't  go wrong with the happy hour specials ! This is my go to Applebee's !"}
{"text":"Strange experience. Staff was friendly, restaurant was moderately clean. However, my wife ordered a hamburger with an egg (can't remember the name). The egg was Sunnyside up. When we asked them to cook it completely we were told they would burn it. I asked why they couldn't cook another egg....the kitchen manager said \"no one wants it that way\". After much discussion they cooked another egg. My bill was $90 with tip......would've been spent more wisely somewhere else. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here to take advantage of their half priced appetizers after 10pm.  I like their combo platter, but I will concur with earlier reviews about fries tasting cold and old.  I would highly recommend their long island iced tea because of the price.  Their servers were great though as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? The food used to be really good, and the portions reasonable. Nowadays the portion sizes are skimpy and it's obvious the food isn't fresh, but reheated. Today I ordered the soup and salad lunch combo, which I've ordered before. I love their French onion soup, even if it is reheated, but the salad was really disappointing. I should have taken a picture. The serving size was noticeably smaller than normal. I've ordered the combo before, so I get that is a smaller portion, but this was just sad. If I had to guess, I'd say there was less than a cup of lettuce, and I feel like they skimped on the chicken too (I ordered the southwest chicken salad). The kids meals are sad too. The serving sizes are very small, and personally I feel like a sit-down restaurant should be making their own mac and cheese instead of using Kraft. It just feels cheap and half-assed, and they charge $5 for it.   Another thing that I've found disappointing over the years with Applebees is how they've discontinued so many good dishes. One of my favorite things was their blackened chicken salad. Now, they only have a lot four or five different salads to choose from and they're hella-expensive for the regular size - over $11. That's insane. Years ago it used to be $8-$9 was which a little more reasonable.   I've also heard from current/former employees that the food isn't made fresh. It's reheated. How can Applebees have the audacity to masquerade as an actual restaurant if they lack actual cooks in their kitchens?   The entire franchise has really gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"We had the two for twenty. I had the low calorie option and it was very good. This place is really close to the the airport and a double tree not really local people dinning mostly transient people. There are more options up eastern."}
{"text":"First Applebee's in YEARS!!! But hey, when they mommies get out for a drink, where not picky. Was greeted right away on a Friday night round 830- bar was about half open, was able to get a spot for me and my friend right away. Bartender Jess was nice and prompt on greeting me! Tried the Irish peach sour. It was different but could definitely taste the Jameson which I liked. (Mamma don't like no weak drinks). My gf came and we finished our drinks, only to stop by after our movie was done. Jess was still there- she recognized is and asked how the movie was! And as before was very quick to get our orders, drinks out, food out, etc. all in all I had a very good experience here, thanks mostly to Jess!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Applebees in over a year, and I recall back then how pleased my family and I were with the food (taste and portion size) and attentive service at a few different locations that we dined at.  Last night I visited this location near 44th St and Thomas and was extremely disappointed with the experience.   In the past my favorite dish had been shrimp with pasta (forgot the exact dish name), as this was served in a large, indented serving bowl and the portion size was very generous.   This time I ordered a new menu item --  Shrimp and Broccoli Cavatappi, which was delicious, but they totally skimped on the portion size, as there was very little pasta and shrimp - - seemingly a child's portion -- and I had to order some soup afterward as I was still hungry.  My aunt had ordered the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken, which she found to be dry, bland and overcooked.   Then unfortunately, there was the deplorable service.  The hostess that served our party was very slow to respond to our requests for additional food items and cutlery.   The server had forgotten all about my soup and had to put the order in again, and my sister-in-law had asked for an extra knife, but after 10 minutes she had to go up and look around for an extra knife herself.  Don't know why there has been a steep decline in the quality and service at Applebees, but based on this recent visit, neither me nor my family plan on returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Not a huge Applebee's fan to begin with but thought ide give it a shot after seeing all the commercials for the new 2 for 20 and quesadilla burger. Let's just say should a gone to chilis.. First the service was so bad I was almost shocked and I thought the awfulness that is Applebee's couldn't surprise me anymore.. Me and my friend walk in and there's a few people in the waiting area..the hostess and the manager walk past us without a word..not sure of their names but the girl was a larger girl with faded red hair and the manager was a short man and African american.. I was and little surprised not one of them acknowledged us .. Then the host grabs her silver ware and without even looking up at the two groups of people waiting to be seated she says okay who was here last..like excuse me..I'm fine thanks for asking.. The family ahead of us stated they were waiting on a both and she takes them to it.. The manager looks at us and says it will be a few minutes not even a greeting..my friend states we would like a booth and he says okay it'll be a few minutes and just stares at us.. Then he begins to clean a booth next to the waiting are and asks if it's okay. We say yes and he cleans it.. The hostess comes back and says he cleaned the booth for you guys right, again no greeting or smile..so rude.. So we sit down annndnd guess what now my annndnd is wet because the moron manager couldn't even clean the booth properly. At this point I wanna go but then our server comes I think her name was adriana or something similar and thank got she waited on us. She was terrific, fast friendly I wish I could say her amazing service made up for the trip but then the food came.. We got the quesadilla burgers. .so gross and soggy and salty... we asked for napkins the manager gave us 3..then when he brought us our condiments he didn't even bother to walk.around to our table he was reached over the side and handed it to us..like what the heck I've never seen anything so unprofessional and rude and from the manager.. And the man has no people skills my friend took the meat outta her quesadilla burger halfway thru he asked her if she wanted something else..not even coming to the table just leaning over the side yet again..she said no thank you it was just to much meat for her taste and he asks if she's sure she states yes and he like stated her down then walked away.. I can't believe these people work in customer service ..Applebee's your food sucks at least make sure your staff doesn't and give that Arianna girl a raise..the only one in the building doing her job"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they took off the lime chicken on 2 for 20 so I don't go there anymore.  Service so so and the cocktails are pre measured an weak. Better places to go."}
{"text":"My beer draft split on a floor due to table moving and got offer from the manger 1/2 cup beer ,so we are laughing are u serious?? Let me have full cub and ill pay for it ,what management don't have experience"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I came here is because I had a gift card. I haven't eaten here since about '08, and now I remember why. Haha.   1. Our waitress was pretty bad. Didn't know the menu or if the pathetic excuse for a kitchen had common seasonings and spices, such as cayenne pepper. According to her, no they did not.   2. She also was very slow, and there was enough staff to accommodate the few guests that they had. Pretty poor service given the customer to waiter ratio. I've waited tables before, and this was terrible, there was only three of us, and all of our drinks had run out. When she finally noticed, it took 15 minutes to bring refills.   3. Our ticket time was a good 25 minutes. We ordered chicken tenders w/ onion rings, penne pasta with chicken, fiesta chicken w/ rice and artichoke spinach dip appetizer. My pasta was dry and hardly had any sauce. The chicken was okay, but my brother said the onion rings were gross.   4. Lastly, I informed the manager about the experience and he didn't seem to receive it well. I definitely wasn't looking for any discounts or coupons for the next visit (there won't be one!). I hope they take the money from my tab and invest in improving the restaurant, menu, and training the staff. He kind of just brushed me off and didn't try to make it right. I didn't really expect much anyway, but thought they could use the feedback."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed this place regardless of the low reviews here. We were hesitant to come here, not going to lie. We are huge fans of bar/grill chains and this is the definition of a Caucasian chain. I still really wanted to try Applebee's so HERE. WE. GO.  Dinner service was quiet on a Sunday night and we had a great meal. I was happy to see their menu had a lot of variety & a lot of macro friendly and healthy foods! I ordered the grilled chicken breast bruschetta, which came with potatoes and steamed veggies. Not impressed by the veggies, the chicken was average. Honestly I think it may have been a bit over cooked and the bruschetta was just average. I was just happy they had such a clean source of protein and allowed me to fit my macros even when eating out- which is rare! I was left full, content and satisfied. My bf ordered fish tacos and they were HUGE! Portions are large and he was stuffed, which is hard to do.. haha. I probably could've eaten one and a half and been full.  One thing I also enjoyed is they offer small bite sized desserts (bite size brownie, LEGGGGGO). A small decadent brownie with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Fabulous for your calorie count and stomach. Just enough to satisfy that inner dessert craving. Only $2 too!  Service was great as well. Very attentive and impressed with how well we were served even though our waitress was on crutches.  I'd definitely go here again! Way better than a Kelsey's any day."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I've been to Applebees, we came late night after a Shania Twain concert. Came for the app specials they were very tasty, we got the tacos, spinach dip, pretzels, boneless wings.        The waitress wasn't the best though, she didn't check on us, we had to go to the bar for refills in our drinks. Then she had an attitude when we asked for our bill."}
{"text":"Living in Laveen I want to support the local establishments. However, I would rather drive to Apache Junction then eat here again. The food is over priced mediocre at best. The employees all speak and act as though your in some bad gang movie, all the time touting there new renovations. The place still screams nasty dark truck stop, the Appelbees Corp needs to get a Handel on this ASAP."}
{"text":"The Applebee's on Elliot is a Big NO for me. Service is very slow & they didn't even give me the correct amount of food I paid for! I will say that I do go to the Applebee's on 24th & Baseline quite frequently. It's good for a quick drink, food is average, service is ok! Go during non-busy hrs to avoid the crowd. Drink of choice is the Blue Moon or Long Island Iced Tea"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I have ever had at at a restaurant and I didn't even get to eat. We walk in, obviously they are busy people are sitting in the front and waiting. The hostess were not friendly. They don't greet you. I was stared at with a look of disdain and annoyance when our table was finally ready twenty minutes later, I didn't mind, we knew we had to wait she just walked us back and left... Didn't ask us if we needed a high chair for any of my kids or anything. Just left. We sat there another fifteen minutes and not a single person stopped by. We stared at many workers yet no one heeded our dear in the headlights look. Finally, one of the hostess, k*****, was behind us clearing a table. I simply said \"excuse me, it had been over fifteen minutes and no one has come by our table\" Another look of annoyance and then a very rude Response with a snippy attitude. I asked for her manager who just so happened to be right behind her. I told her of my experiences thus far and then decided to leave. Upon leaving k***** was upfront whispering with her blonde minion. I asked for her name and she held up her name tag and said \"yeah! It's K*****!\" In a very hostile manner. I let the manager know, but obviously this girl has somewhat of a free range because she has no issues being a complete c word to customers. I will never go to an apple bees again. Ever. And K***** you are a super CLASSY broad. That attitude will get you super far in life"}
{"text":"Slow.  Our server greeted us took our order. And said \"I'll be back with your drinks as soon as I can\"  went and put our order in. Then. Checked on another table then. Went and cashed out another table..   I see NO teamwork here. Hostess walking around could certainly assist the 1 server on the floor..  certainly could use a lesson on service. Decor needs updated. Broken blinds. Worn flooring, worn table tops, nails hanging out of woodwork.  Dirty bathroom. Smells of urine.  Dining room ceiling is filthy with dust especially around the air vents and returns..  Hostess walking around in a daydream state. It's quite funny.   No manager visit. It's slow this is a crucial service period.  16 minutes early have passed still no food..ordered French onion soup. It would help if their was actual soup in the bowl.. Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp was overcooked.. we won't be back.. we recommend other places"}
{"text":"Saturday 8/22/15  Really sweet hostess greeted us and held the door open for me & a friend. It seemed  promising until we walked into a ghost town. We asked to be seated at the bar. At 3:17 pm we were greeted by Emmie A.  I was willing to try the two for $20.  I choose the salad & the American standard burger that comes with sauce.  It was good, but my bottom bun was soaked in with tangy sauce. I liked the sauce but next time i'll ask light sauce.  I thought the burger meat was really good and it was a big portion.  I don't like how you have to respond to the touch screen to get a refill.  I like it when your waitress asks a quick question, \"how's the food?\"  That touch screen eliminates human interaction.  When she came by she never asked if I liked my burger so I felt like she didn't care about our experience. She did smirk dropping of the guest copy but never smiled or welcomed us back soon.  I like it when when people try to get out their shell. I'm quiet too but I wanted to like this newly renovated location.  I don't live that far from it either.  I saw after we finished our meals I noticed the happy hour menu 3-6pm 9-close. I would of liked to of known that before ordering but it was hiding behind the big ketchup bottle.  You must order a beverage with it."}
{"text":"Horrible! Just horrible! I ordered  pickup & there is nothing positive I can say about our meal. The spinach/ artichoke dip was awful. The salad was basically greens with one cherry tomato, two croutons & about four shreds of cheese. The steak I ordered medium was extremely rare, the shrimp that came with it amounted to three pieces, the garlic mashed potatoes were stiff & void of any garlic & the veggies were hard & undercooked. I have never had such a disappointing meal that cost $50, ever. I will never go to Applebee's again. I could have had a better meal at a fast food joint and a  lot cheaper."}
{"text":"Awesome location, such friendly staff .. Oh don't get me started on the Hot Blonde dessert... it's a must"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this exact one for years and years. Everyone knows what to expect from an applebeas. But, the friendly staff always makes meals more enjoyable. And I can say, this may not be in the best of areas, but it's very friendly. Check it out."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Applebee's in probably over a year but last week I took my co worker up on her offer to go to lunch! I'm sure glad I did because the lunch was great! We came during the lunch hour special and both of us had the Caesar Salad with shrimp pasta! The portion isn't huge but it's definitely enough to hit that hunger spot! Our waitress was very friendly and attentive which goes a long way in my book! The fact that they have this little tablet thingy you can order your own deserts and appetizers on is pretty cool! Technology is incredible I tell ha hopefully it's not putting nobody out of a job :-/ anyways I'll be sure to return if the opportunity presents itself again in the near future! You can't go wrong with the 2 for $20 deals!"}
{"text":"Applebee's you disappointed me for sure. I took a leap out on faith and decided to try eating at Applebee's being that it's being so long since my last visit. The other night I was so hungry and really wasn't looking to sit down in the restaurant so I tried out the whole car side to go thing. Ordering the food on line was a breeze but whether or not you get the food correctly and at the stated time is a different story. I had to deduct a couple stars because my food wasn't ready at the time that they stated it would be... To add insult to injury I got all the way to my next destination to only find out that they didn't place my silverware in the bag when I specifically check marked the box online indicating I would like some. The sauce for my buffalo wings was ranch instead of the blue cheese I requested. The girl who brought out the order brought my food to the wrong car originally and yeah it was just a complete mess I won't be using the service any more and I will also make sure that I check the bag, silly me for trusting that my order was correct."}
{"text":"Walked in at 12:30pm and was blown away by the wait staff. I have had meals for $300 per person that didn't have such good service. Waiter was there in under thirty seconds whenever I raised my hand but otherwise didn't distract me from my meal and audiobook. Food was above average and cooked as perfectly as is possible with pasta."}
{"text":"Let's start off the review by talking about how nasty it was to be greeted by a cricket once we were seated at our booth! I really should've left but I didn't because my friend and I had been driving around looking for food prior to making this stop to Applebee's. Once I brought it to the servers attention she apologized and moved us to a different table! This was a very quick in and out type of dining trip anyways so.. We went with the 3 for $12.50 deal where you can pick from both the Bar Snacks and appetizers! Since we weren't that starving we preferred to only prefer off that part of the menu. Our server was nice but super persistent about up selling these additional appetizers for $3 more.. Since when did they get commission or something for up selling more food? Beats me but we weren't having it I ordered what I ordered nothing more. Food was mediocre at best but what else can you expect with the appetizers and bar snacks? Anyways did the job but filling that hunger spot.. Not sure I'll be back to this location.."}
{"text":"No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever."}
{"text":"Applebee's always have the best chicken and shrimp that I've ever tasted and I also love the jasmine rice with the mushrooms so awesome meal"}
{"text":"El d√≠a s√°bado por la noche invite a mis suegros a cenar y decide llevarlos a Applebee, fue la peor experiencia que pude haber tenido espere 30 minutos para pasar a la mesa inmediatamente ordenamos la cena esperamos por 40 minutos y nos informaron que tres de los platos no saldr√≠an me pareci√≥ muy mal servicio porque nos hicieron esperar m√°s de 40 minutos para informarnos que la orden saldr√≠a por la mitad y que por los otros platos habr√≠a que esperar m√°s  Pienso que la mesera no paso la orden a tiempo nosotros nos paramos y decidimos irnos del restaurante el m√°nager sali√≥ y pidi√≥ disculpas y nos dijo que no pasar√≠amos las bebidas 1 cerveza 2 sodas 1 agua Terminamos cenando en el Mac Donald que est√° al frente fueron 2 horas que perd√≠ y quede mal con mis invitados  De versa fue una mala experiencia en est√° restaurante"}
{"text":"I usually order here often but this last week they really showed they don't give a fuck   Ordered steak well done and both where still pink .  Then they had the nerve to argue me down about it.  Pick up area smells like a urinalysis, hella pods and toilet smells , not a good look and they dropped a few notches in my book"}
{"text":"I have been here many times because I've lived in surprise for 16 years. I have never been this upset at this Applebee's. The music has been blaring for far too long. My friend got a headache. And yes we went and complained but they only turned it down a little. This is unacceptable. I'm very disappointed. If we had gotten our food already I would have eaten quickly and left. If you come late at night I would say you shouldn't. Thank you.   This isn't a concert. This is a restaurant. My friends and I are not the only ones covering our ears. There is an elderly couple who are trying to enjoy their food but can't because they are having their ears. This should not be allowed. I am very upset and can't believe that this is allowed."}
{"text":"Ok. We come here and find out they are out of fries, out of potatoes, out of lemons and out of won ton tacos.   In addition we find out the wait time to get our food is an hour.  Really, whoever is the manager needs to be fired and they need to start over."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Tiffany was our server the last time we went and she made us feel like old friends. Very personable, and kept our water and iced tea filled to the brim. (I was with the bf, and like most desert dwellers, we're always parched)  I love their unlimited soup and salad. for 30 cents upcharge, you can get the salads with chicken or shrimp. hardly unreasonable. I think it's $7.29 (6.99 for veg salads only) I like the tomato soup, and french onion soup.  The decor here is awesome. Very nostalgic with plenty of happy pictures to look at.  I come here for lunch on the weekends about once a month, consistently.  Good for any age."}
{"text":"$1 MARGARITAS....watered down but hey it's a $1, what did I expect! Good marketing strategy though...it brought the crowd in!!! Kudos"}
{"text":"We ordered the fiesta lime chicken. It was like licking a salt shaker   I became so sick and I only had three bites., I ended up in the ER.  Thanks Applebee's. Why not ad more salt to your meals.  This is my last visit there. We use to love this Resturant"}
{"text":"Don't agree with the previous reviews.  I am staying next door at Courtyard.  As soon as I seated myself at the tables by the bar, was immediately attended.  Abbie was my waitress and took great care of me.  Matt, Manager, stopped in to check on me.  Very satisfied."}
{"text":"We came for lunch with a group of 8 and had really great service!!! Of course we ordered the ribs, soup and salad, chicken, and the kids had chicken tenders:) our server was Lisa, and she was really attentive and very friendly"}
{"text":"Everything was very good, love the new menu!  I used to not be a big fan, but I will be back.  Now to get my wife to try Applebee's again..."}
{"text":"Their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Probably the worst AppleBees ever. Every time my friend and go, I've noticed the manager touches every table but ours. This is really a concern and can no longer be a patron."}
{"text":"Dec 26 ordered appetizers, drinks and $6.99 bugers and fries.  Waited 40 minutes for appetizers.  Had to ask waitress 2 times.  She said manager would come see us.  Jaime Brown was rude, made excuses, rude, rude and finally walked off after saying she has done this for 18 years.    Appetizer ( chips and salsa) showed up.   Within 5 minutes our food arrived.  Waitress said the food was on Applebee's and she apologized.   Manager said they were not short handed for a Monday----Dec 26 is usually super busy everywhere.   Over heard wait staff saying people did not show up for their shift.   Plenty of open tables, but no wait staff. Rude and excuses don't make for a pleasant family meal.   Thanks for buying us lunch but the rudeness was unexcusable."}
{"text":"I've been to a different Applebee's location a few times and could never figure out why I kept going back, giving them chance after chance. It was NEVER a good experience so when my family came into town and wanted to go eat at the Applebee's by my house I was skeptical. Well let me tell you, this location is amazing. Short wait to be seated, the staff was really friendly and knowledgeable and the food was amazing. I wanted to order as dairy and meat free as possible and our server DJ was so kind and accommodating. I wanted a salad that I had read about online but was no longer on the menu, DJ made it happen. The wait time for food was average and it was fresh and delicious! I won't think twice about coming here next time :)"}
{"text":"Very bad service. Also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here. Also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEE's"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for father's day dinner. Bourbon Street Steaks were good as always but the blonde skillet ordered for desert came without the icing.   When i called to let them know they it was left out they seemed unconcerned and said i could drive back and get it uf i wanted it. The lady on the phone made me feel like they didnt want to know they had messed up.    Probably wont visit this Applebee's again. They dont care about their customers getting what they paid for,  just wont pay them for anything again. Mesa has too many good places to eat to deal with poor attitude"}
{"text":"EYAN WAS A PERFECT SERVER! she was one of the nicest people that i have ever came across in the food industry:) She was super attentive and patient. Every time she walked by our drinks were filled and she always offered if we needed anything else. This location is extremely clean and everyone here is super nice and attentive. the atmosphere is perfect! Prices arent high at all so if youre on a budget eat here lol. The food is yummy and very filling."}
{"text":"Good easy access location. Server very friendly and food is pretty good. Average for similar chains. Good value.  Definitely good variety and new additions all the time."}
{"text":"First I haven't been to Applebee's for some time . Now I remember why. When we walked in it was pretty busy and loud. I asked to sit at a booth. The host n hostess looked around said said it would be 5 minutes or so. So I scanned the room and there are 3 open and clean booths. So I asked if they're saving those for good customers or what? Obviously challenging yhe powers of Applebees staff can be dangerous but now I'm feelin like \" Game on \"  let's dance . So they immediately seat me and are pissed so I started taking pictures of everything including them to send to corporate.  Ok server was a rookie and tried hard but obviously new. We ordered and drinks and food came out pretty quick. But then a girl comes over and started sweeping in front of my table. Like restaurant sin 101. Food was presented nice and they have a really wide menu. The taste was better than expected for the won ton tacos and boneless buffalo wings. Tasty sauces for Applebee's.  The rating is for overall experience as there was some surprising high spots and more low spots. Ciao"}
{"text":"Honestly, not a fan of Applebee's to begin with, but we were hungry and it was our best \"cheap\" sit down dinner spot around. Service was awful, our waitress was hardly around and never once asked how our meals were. I ordered the fiesta chicken wrap or whatever... it's chicken, pico de gallo and lettuce in a white flour tortilla with melted cheese and let me tell you... don't wast the 9.59 this thing costs. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place service is terrible.  Ordered no appetizer no refills. No sever totally ignoring us.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Just for a drink took about 20 minutes, waitress was rude and the food tasted like it came out of a bag from the freezer. Nothing at all good to say about this Applebee's."}
{"text":"The food was AmAzInG!!!!! The service was very friendly! By far the best service of any restaurant that I've been to in Calgary yet. The kitchen didn't see the note to substitute mashed potatoes for fries, so they ended up bringing my partner both...at no extra charge! Very pleased with everything, will totally be returning!"}
{"text":"Went for endless riblettes and chicken tenders.  Was seated and greeted quickly.  Orders taken quickly too.  Ordered riblettes first, took a good 20 minutes to come out, only a handful of tables there.  Fries were hot, coleslaw was nice, riblettes were only warm and kinda annoying to eat.  Next we ordered the chicken strips, don't like the over breaded type they serve, fries this round were either chewy and cold or chewy and warm."}
{"text":"First time at this location and we were not impressed at all with the food. We waited for 10min to be seated the hostess said \" we are having complications with servers\", our server I forget his name but he was a great server especially since it was 4pm and he wasnt even clocked in until 5pm ( I overheard him)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, convenient.  Today husband and I ordered: Husband: steak, ribs, green beans and fries: Ribs and fries hot  delicious. Steak and green beans cold! My meal: steak, garlic grilled shrimp, brocolli, onion rings. Onion rings hot and delicious. Steak cold, brocolli cold and shrimp cold! No more! How can you serve cold food? Yes, food came out picture perfect, but not not good. Our server was very nice and very embarrassed!"}
{"text":"Shit! Cold food. Leftovers served here. Wouldn't recommend this location. Waited 30 minutes for the plate. Returned it to get a new made because the \"4 Cheese Pasta\" was missing the sauce and ironically the cheese. They come back 5 minutes later to tell me that they don't have anymore. My Fathers plate was also cold."}
{"text":"We still frequent this location. We still sit at the bar and it's typically Danny (Dex) that is behind the bar nowadays.  Being regular, they all know us when we walk in which is awesome because it's a real \"local\" feel. If Ever is behind the doors in the kitchen, do yourself a favor and order a steak. He's awesome on the grille. Now that high school football is here, it'll be a few more weeks before we can get back to our \"regulars\" status, but rest assured, when the season is done, we'll be back, sitting in our regular seats at the bar."}
{"text":"Nasty manager. Presented a coupon. The waiter said i can use it for appetizer as stated in the coupon. When i got the bill they did not apply it. When i argued about the coupon use the manager came in and was very nasty in her response. She said that is only for US Applebees not Canadian one. However the coupon posted on Yelp for Applebees in Canada not US. Extremely unprofessional and very poor reaction."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and prompt. But the food was so overpriced and unimpressive . I paid $12 for a Thai shrimp salad, it was a bowl of lettuce with 6 little shrimp in it. I am so over the mediocre overpriced food at Applebee's. I am not going back. Ugh"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night with a couple friends. It was surprisingly quiet in there. Our server was polite and helpful and talked with us a bit about the game that was on their tvs. Wasn't a particularly special experience but that's not why we came there. It's a national chain with decent food and a good atmosphere and that's what we got. Although I will say, a server walked behind me with someone's food and it sounded like it was a skillet and it smelled really good. I wish I knew what it was and ordered it, but alas, it wasn't meant to be"}
{"text":"Worst Postmates delivery from here! Ordered 3 things: oriental chicken salad (crispy chicken and dressing on side), oriental chicken salad (friend chicken and No almonds) and kids chicken and French fries with side of honey mustard and chocolate milk. Delivery came and guy has a 5 star rating. What I received: 2 oriental chicken salads both with almonds and dressing. A kids chicken fingers with no lie, about 15 French fries and no chocolate milk. That's it! Never again from here or Postmates in general! If I could, I'd give them a 0."}
{"text":"Service was great. Foods great. Roger the manager was very nice and welcoming to all the veterans on  veterans day. Great time"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and the service just keeps getting worst and worst. Today I saw three people get up and leave after waiting for 30-45 minutes. Our wait time was long too and the waiter was horrible. Feels like their food keeps getting worst too."}
{"text":"Typical applebees. The host is crazy and talks too much, the food is reliably good and consistent."}
{"text":"Expect to wait to be seated and have a lot of staff ignore you. We waited about 8 minutes to get seated on a Friday night. The bartender, who had three people total at the bar, kept looking over at us and the other parties waiting, and did nothing. One waitress looked at everyone, and instead of seating people or getting a hostess plopped herself down at the bar and started chatting with the bartender. There at least 6 employees who saw people waiting to be seated and did nothing. Besides the awful service, the portion sizes are getting smaller and smaller and the prices higher. Applebees used to get good. Crossing this location off our list of places to go."}
{"text":"Holy mother of siracha shrimp. I could live off of that mouth watering goodness.  Talk about epic mouthgasms.... I was always hesitant about Applebee's outside of the closest and cheapest place to drink after a long night at work. Pick a flavor and they will make it into a freaking Long Island.  I'm sold. Booze and shrimp 4 lyf3!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food came out hot, delicious and timely! We got the 2 for 20 deal, but they also have 2 for 25 that includes steak. They have tons of specials and happy hour! Make sure you check the website for the happy hour times..I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife picked up dinner from here, and placed the order online. I got the parmesan shrimp and sirloin. While the steak and grilled vegetables are delicious, there is ZERO shrimp in my meal. How hard is it to put one of the two main ingredients in the box. I am not driving all the way back there to complain, but COME ON! It is a STEAK AND SHRIMP MEAL!! I realize that it is Friday night a very busy, but if you can't handle it, HIRE MORE HELP!"}
{"text":"For a bees its what I have come to expect, fast and courteous service at a good price. Here at happy hour plenty of tables, but not empty. Good wings and drink prices during happy hr. Ill come back once in a while for sure."}
{"text":"I like their lunch menu. The portions are a tiny bit small but still fills you up. I'm a of the pick 2 lunch deal. And it's awesome they let us choose 2 entrees. Usually get the penne pasta and chicken wrap. Price is right and food is good. Definitely a worthwhile lunch spot. Only negative is its always busy during lunch ao food and bill will take a while tO get to you. Don't think I've ever made it back in under an hour and it's a block away."}
{"text":"Applebees .month of Dec.2017 dont get reeled in for the $1.00 Long Island Ice Teas for $1.You get what you pay for!  they looked like sewer water and tasted worst. and they only let me order 1 drink special at a time. They dont know how to make them properly. Yuk. although excellent quick service and polite.....Spring Mountain Location"}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Sunday afternoon. Noticed it wasn't too many cars in the parking lot and there were many open tables from what we could see through the window, which was very odd for a Sunday. But when entering the establishment we could easily see that they had a Sanitation Rating of 92.5. IMMEDIATELY my wife said we will not be eating here, though I was willing to go for it. We ended up making a U-turn and leaving before getting to the hostess. But after now seeing the Yelp reviews for this location, I am very happy we did not eat there."}
{"text":"Tried to order to go two nights in a row. App wouldn't allow for any changes to meals, i.e. Hold tomatoes, so had to call in. Second night finally got someone to answer phone AND take order. Previous attempts were answered, asked to hold, then forgotten about. When finally did get food parts were cold and other parts were wrong. Inedible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"went here after doing my MS walk to have lunch with my family to celebrate.. we had a party of 10 food took 2 hours, they kept forgetting to bring some orders out, then on top of that all my family was served but myself because they had not made mine so I had to wait an additional 30 minutes. a party of 15 came in after us and had their food before us with no problems this was soooo horrible. I will say this our server was beyond amazing loved his energy patience & communication!! I will never go here again if I could give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Bad Service. Four time visitor as a temporary transplant, it seems only long time locals get service.  No condiments with take out. Maybe ketchup, mayonnaise, steak sauce if what you order would usually come with? No Wonder Applebee's is closing 250 locations. The food is no surprise, mediocre, exactly what you would expect."}
{"text":"I have stayed away from Applebee's for several years as they ALWAYS made a mistake on my order. I always order car side to go. I am a busy professional and I eat out quite frequently. I placed my order. As always, my order was not on time. (When I placed my order online I was given a time it would be ready ) I waited a good 10minutes before I was acknowledged. I received my order in another 15minutes. I get home and I find out that they messed up my order. Mind you it's 115 degrees outside and I live about 15-20min away. I call the store to speak with a manager. She offered to remake my meal and I would travel to go pick it up or she could report it to Corporate and they would send me something. It was hot out and I was tired. I opted for Corporate to send me something. I received two $5 coupons. The audacity...the insult!! I am sure I spent close to $40 on my order. The $5 coupon is a slap in the face! I will not take time out of my day to order a meal and be treated poorly as a customer! I had the expectation that my meal would be replaced and not at my expense! #WorstExperienceEver #LostMeAsACustomer"}
{"text":"Worst Applebee's ever, this location reminded me why I stopped eating at this chain period. First the wait for the food was long and they weren't even busy second we asked for medium rare on our sirloin and all our meat was well done. drinks never got refilled we ordered mixed drinks that took over 30 min to get. Oh and the manager asked us what kinda sauce we wanted and I guess he forgot to bring us the A1 cause he never came back. Our waitress wasn't attentive. Applebee's is not the spot like it use to be years ago. This location sucks take your business somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Came in for the all you can eat riblets. However maybe I should have picked another Applebees that didn't have a 2 star rating :(  The service here was ultra slow, think we was seated for 15 minutes before the waitress even came by.  The giblets finally came out and they tasted suprisingly good. After I cleared my first round again 15 minutes of waiting for the waitress to come by. Finally she does and then brings a plate with only 3 little rickets on it. I didn't want to wait anymore so I left.   I gave 2 stars because the riblets actually tasted great. Just the service was abysmal."}
{"text":"I am an avid Applebees fan. In high school I used to go a few times a month for half price apps.   Since they've changed their menu, I've rarely gone. After moving to Matthews, my boyfriend and I visited this location twice. Both times were subpar. The food has gone downhill. Not sure if it's because of the menu change or this particular location, but the quality just isn't there.   Both times the service was horrible. They were nice but so slow and rarely checked in. As much as I love Applebees, they've lost a long time customer. I will be back, eventually, but probably not to this location."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been here several times this month and everything was cooked perfectly!  I am now recommending to try it out again. Several years back I swore to never go back but gave them another chance...we are making it a date night once a month now!  I want to try everything!  Fast and friendly service with good coffee."}
{"text":"I don't usually dine at corporate restaurants, but I've been craving the Oriental Chicken Salad for some time now so I thought I'd grab one before my hair appointment. The salad was good. Just as I remember. Nothing spectacular, but subsided my craving. I was alone so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. Everyone was really helpful and the bartender is lovely, but she seems so overwhelmed having 6 patrons at the bar. I think she may have had another bartop table, but absolutely nothing crazy. A bartender shouldn't be weeded with so little going on. Maybe she was just having an off day, but I think it's a safe to suggest she's in the wrong field.  I'll come back again when I have another craving but probably not soon. The happy hour drinks are a petty good deal of you want to grab a quick drink. Anyway, good luck!!!"}
{"text":"The two for $25 deal is pretty awesome. Choose one app to share and pick 2 entrees. We had a steak with baked potato and the Bourbon St chicken and shrimp. Both were good. Chicken was juicy and tender and the Cajun flavor was awesome. Steak was typical. Server forgot our order of the pretzels with queso dip but no biggie. We had room for dessert. The triple chocolate meltdown is mouthwateringly good!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Applebee's for a long time since they stopped offering Riblets, but when they announced a Riblets special I decided to give it a try; I also ordered the Blue Moon beer special.  The first thing that was off was the sauce. It wasn't the Riblets sauce they were known for in decades past. It was some gloppy supermarket bottle-type, and simply not very good. But even worse, the meat was old. It wasn't quite spoiled but it definitely had that old-freezer-meat taste, disgusting. Unfortunately the beer wasn't much better, it was stale. I exchanged it for a Coors light, and that was better but also a bit stale. How can a restaurant not even have fresh Coors light? Maybe they let kegs sit around for six months before tapping them? I ate at the bar, the bartender was pleasant, that was the only good thing here, the food was terrible and I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Applebees ever! My boyfriend and I came for the soup and salad lunch special. The waitress seemed to be someplace else the entire time. When I ordered my first salad and soup I asked that no bread be put in my French onion soup. When it came not only did it have bread it had a french fry in it. I sent the soup back and asked for the breadsticks that accompany and the waitress brought back the soup and no breadsticks. Long story short we had to ask 3 additional times for breadsticks and when they finally came they were greasy as hell. Besides the piss poor service the dishes were dirty. The only thing that was consistent was the waitress apologizing to the other patrons for the multiple screw ups. Never again, it makes no sense to have such horrible customer service and expect to be tipped."}
{"text":"Good stable place for reliable food. Service adequate but timing poor. If we order appetizers we like to finish b 4 the meal not get the meal and then have to choose. Music ridiculously loud.  I am not pleased w the pay at the table; Weird and not very personable which is the reason to eat out, personal service. Moved down a few notches on the go to list. Prices still great for good food."}
{"text":"After leaving the location on 24th street and Baseline, I drive here looking for better service.  We walked in and were sat immediately. The restaurant was nearly empty. We went to our booth and about 10 minutes later, a waitress comes over and says she'll be taking our drink order.  Now I already knew what I wanted since we waited a bit to even make human contact with anyone besides the host. The young lady took my drink order, and when I attempted to make my meal order she said she'll be right back.   Well right back never happened because she was so busy chatting it up with the table behind us. 10 minutes passed, then 20. Still with NO DRINKS not even water! So I got up just as I did the first location and took my ass to McDonald's. What a night."}
{"text":"Second time i come here and i tried to avoid it but i figured since i was gifted a giftcard ill go ahead and use it. The waiter was great , we avoided certain items like the dried ribs and rubber rice this time and played it safe with the pasta dishes.However, it appeared that they were unable to use my giftcard because of a \"internet issue\" but were able to charge my card. Claiming that the system was down but hey is it okay if we charge it on your card?... like really? did i really have a choice? Mmmmmmmm. The issue is that i wasnt really given a second option. I checked the gift card balance over the phone why cant they? Regretfully i will not be returning nor does it seem i will be able to redeem the giftcard."}
{"text":"we were greeted and seated right away on a Saturday afternoon. The strawberry lime margarita was like a fruit punch. The waitress was informed but did nothing just stated that is how it is. The mozzarella sticks were good but the sauce was out of jar. The burger was sad. I wished we had gone to Culvers or Freddys for a better burger and fries. My mother had a pomegranate flavored tea served warm with melted ice. We asked the server to add more pomegranate. We added the ice from the margarita glass which was a tall glass skinny filled to the brim with ice to the tea. The shrimp and fries from the 2 for 25 deal was bland. Tasted frozen my mom was upset for a 53.00 dollar meal that we could have had better from frozen items at home. I had not been to this Applebees in 6 years. I will not be back, so sad and they say they love their seniors. Poor food quality and high prices. Shame on Applebees!"}
{"text":"I just left this place with my friend, the only pro is that the waiters were super friendly and the service was fast, got our food pretty quick considering it was busy. We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap."}
{"text":"Great place I enjoyed the service and my server was amazing definitely recommend this location for a great meal and even better service  thank you Libby"}
{"text":"Worst bartender ever! The bartender Mike ignored me for over 15 minutes! In addition, the entire bar smelled like raw sewage...never again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I use to eat here and then we stopped because of the low quality meals. We came back and discovered that they are still serving low quality. I ordered the steak quesadilla and literally had 5 small pieces in the entire order and my husband ordered the pasta and chicken and had 4 pieces of chicken. If this is what Applebee's call acceptable than their manager should be fired."}
{"text":"Secure is excellent and the prices are fair. The happy hour offers such amazing deals, and the drink specials are awesome too! I have to give 3 stars because much of the food is low quality. Had the ribs tonight and they were bone dry. The shrimp from the Asian shrimp salad tasted like nothing. The Mac n cheese was decent, but the fries were over salted. The artichoke dip was also very salty."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place in horrible. Brittany was our waitress and when we told her our steak was well done and we asked for medium she responded \"we don't cut the steaks in the back\" like duh! How about placing the order correctly and then coming to see how it tastes like regular waitresses. The supervisor's name is Amy and she didn't bother to check on the problem but instead removed the dirty plates next to us that had been there for 45 minutes when I asked what is the managers name loudly. Terrible, terrible!"}
{"text":"Been to this Applebee's multiple times and received poor service every single time from multiple staff members. This location seriously needs to get it together in terms of customer service."}
{"text":"Great management. I really like Kelly. Beer was ice cold. Bartender was nice. I really enjoy coming here. If you are looking for good deals and quick service, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy Applebees. It is not a 4 or 5 star experience though. I take my son to lunch because he likes the boneless wings. He is rather picky even at 19. I wanted a lunch combo, but recent menu changes shiw my favotite and soup having been removed.  Soo, I got creative. I ordered a pick your iwn 3 app sampler. 2 choices were the chicken wonton tacos and 3rd choice was a house salad.  This option was 2.00 more than a combo, but considering the choices for lunch,  I was satisfied. It was really more food than I thought I would get. Definitely enough for 2. The waitress was okay. Doing her job but not overyly friendly. Kept our drinks refilled and table cleared.  All in all, exactly as I expected."}
{"text":"I forget how awesome this place can be.  I enjoyed the spinach and shrimp  salad with a bowl of french onion soup.   The new menu is full of okd classics with a new twist.  Come and try them all!"}
{"text":"Well over 10 minutes after we were seated for a waitress. Two managers standing at the hostest stand watching basket ball. Not addressing the issue that no one has come to the table. Waitress finally sees she has a table so we order everything all at once just in case she disappears. One manager sitting at a table to watch basketball. Not going to tables. Oh well guess I shouldn't expect to much after all it is applebees"}
{"text":"Went there with my 12 yo triplets on their birthday and the entire staff was awesome throughout!  Nina did a great job as our server, was very attentive and polite throughout.  Handled the kids and their request like a champ and even had a very pleasant conversation with her and Mary, the manager on duty about their families and kids.  They also made the triplets day by doing the Birthday song and the entire staff came out and got involved.  Was a real treat for the kids!  Thank you all!!  But extra thank you for all the staff members who dug into the trash to find my daughters retainer, which saved a complete meltdown.  That was awesome and much appreciated!  You guys really went above and beyond!!  So thank you again to Nina, Mary, Mimi and all the rest I unfortunately didn't get the names of.  You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and asked for a booth and was told I would have to wait 10 min for one to become available despite pointing out 3 open booths. The problem was the hostess just seated someone in that section. And couldn't seat us there. How is this my problem??"}
{"text":"It's Applebee's what more would it be but 3 stars? Well I will say the place was a life saver when I was getting my car fixed at the sears. I had wanton tacos and big bud light during their happy hour which is 7 days a week which is awesome. It was only 8 dollars! I was happy to be able to just sit in the air conditioning and have a colds beer and friendly service and tasty tacos. So very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Don't bother here when there is Chili's.  Walked in and no one greeted or offered to seat me and I sat down myself then was later moved. My table screen didn't work and was dirty. Plates are small and overpriced. Beer happy hour menu is missleading. Staff is trained to upsell. Waitress rolled her eyes when I ordered a water before the beer."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because my husband likes the ribs and as usual they were very good. But I had the chicken tortilla soup and the chicken lime salsa salad (or something like that) lunch combo. The soup was served luke warm with the tortilla strips doused in the soup so they were all mushy and really ruined the soup. The salad was very good but if you get the lunch combo the salad is extremely small so I left still hungry. The servers are excellent and very friendly here."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't even deserve a star worst service ever shitty manager when u get seated quick and then u sit and wait twenty minutes and it takes another 15 just to get the manager to stop we ask for drinks he didn't apologize he says ok what do u want let me know and I'll go slap the servers,  not funny and then the waiter finally gets to the table and was shitty and mind u this is after four attempts to Bring shit that wasn't ours waiters male and female are walking around carrying food that no one knows who ordered what.  Horrible horrible the waiter said sorry I have a bad attitude I had a lot of tables and I'm thinking there are more servers in there with fewer tables than any place I have ever been to in Vegas and they still couldn't get their shit right!  My advice DONT GO HERE!!! Don't waste your time or tour money!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst apple bees restaurant I've ever been to! My cousin and I waited for about 25 to 30 mins okay that would of been fine if I didn't see empty tables next to tables that were occupied! When we finally got seated,it took our server 20 mins literally to get our drinks out to us! The restaurant was not even that busy! I didn't understand the hold up!We only ordered lemonade! Then we got our food,and our food was real lukewarm! I did not have a good experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I've been to Applebee's a billion times, but yesterday I went with my mom for the 6.99 burger night with a free refill on fries;that they have on Mondays. I ordered the brunch burger with sweet potato fries, and the burger was really good, but my fries I didn't care for to much. The service was pretty slow as well, and I kept having to search for my waitress when I needed something!  Overall, I really enjoyed my burger and some quality time with my mom."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Apple Bee's location. As usual, they have menu options for just about everyone (the skinny, the big and the rich and the poor). The hockey championship game was playing so the bar was full. There was also a 21st birthday party there which was pretty cool. Our waiter was great. He was also waiting on the party, but he made sure to check in with us as often as he could. He check in with us a few times about our food which was a little weird. I guess the way it works is if we order an appetizer it delays the time our entree's come out which is fine. We were in no rush. We had made it just in time for the last 30 minutes of happy hour. The one thing that was also a little weird about our waiter is that he mentioned that he used to work at TGI Fridays and that they all closed down because business was not good. To me, that's not a small talk topic for a party you are waiting on. I ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas. I didn't realize that it does not come with rice on the side, but the rice is really not needed. They give you the chicken, shrimp, peppers and onions plus all the fixings for the fajitas (cheese, salsa, sour cream and softshells). That filled me up.  Otherwise, it seemed like a typical AppleBee's nothing exceptional about it, and there is no reason why I would not go back."}
{"text":"When I think of a place to go for a drink I didn't think of Applebee's but I'm glad I went. They have great drinks and friendly service. The waitress we had removed a drink from my receipt even though I drank the whole drink that I didn't really like. She made sure our glasses were never empty and our food was served hot. They have ladies night every week and kids eat free I think on Tuesday or Wednesday's. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great location, but you never know if they'll be open until you get there.  Thursday night the sign on front door says open until 1:00 am, unfortunately it was 11:40 pm and they were closed?  They have a new way of cooking a burger over there, pink or no pink... If you say pink, it comes out bloody as hell.  If you say no pink it comes out dry as a bone!  What ever happened to medium or medium well?  I will say the service from the waiters and bar staff is always decent and the food isn't too bad!  Great spot for late night food, if they are open!"}
{"text":"We called, made a reservation so we could eat before our show, got there and were told it would be 45 minutes!!!!!  Why did they tell me it was okay, then change their tune when we arrived!!!  That's just wrong!  Say what you mean!  Then tried to say \"well you didn't talk to me\". Get your employees on the same page!!!  No excuse"}
{"text":"Leckeres Essen in toller Atmosph√§re !!! F√ºr jeden etwas dabei nur weiter zu empfehlen"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Applebee's for a few years. Maybe this was why. Place was clean and not very busy. It took a while  before our server stopped by. I had the Brisket something. The server  mentioned that they were very popular and that the brisket was running low, at 6:30pm. I joked that maybe I should  try something else but was told to not worry. I should have worried. I had the hardest time trying to find the meat. Wendy's would have been a better option for the beef."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp. It tasted super good. I was disappointed a little, because it comes with saut√©ed onions and \"mushrooms\". I got no mushrooms"}
{"text":"I am apart of the industry (bartender) and I was completely disappointed on the service I got here tonight 08/16 Tuesday night at our neighborhood bar and grill Applebee's, I came to enjoy a late night after work beer and snack with my significant other and sat down at a table in the bar which is self seating. We sat down going over what we wanted on the small menus in front of us.. 15 minutes rolls by and NO service yet. We could tell the bartender noticed us when we took a few minutes looking for a place to sit realizing there was no room at the bar so we took a table in the bar.   And she never approached us or said hi or welcomed us. As we're sitting there Aaron one of the servers at your location came up to us because he noticed we've been sitting here for awhile now. He asked if we were waiting for drinks and if we've been helped yet. He made sure we got everything we needed and had to go let the bartender ( Ashley) know we were sitting here. Aaron went over the reverse happy hour with us and apologized again for our wait. I am a mom so I know about patience. The girl that was serving us still let us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome like we were an inconvenience for her because we couldn't sit at the bar. So we didn't leave a 20% tip like I usually would because I am in the industry.. Honestly we should've given it to Aaron because he showed us we were welcomed here. I know we are 2 out of thousands of people that visit your restaurant location, but your bad reviews adds up. I understand why you guys are a 2 1/2 star we probably won't ever come back and won't recommend your location to anyone else we know."}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thursday/10:00pm  I brought my family to this establishment for some \"good\" american food. hostess was nice and sat us. Elizabeth our server took 5 mins to acknowledge us. placed our order: mango ice tea, (2)peach sangria, spinach dip, won ton tacos, cedar salmon and full rack of ribs. My fianc√© got her sangria but I never received my mango ice tea (strike 1). We asked for more napkins and that took her 10 mins. (Strike 2). for dessert, I actually requested if I can have a root beer float even if it wasn't in the menu and she obliged. Unfortunately, as I was enjoying my float I chewed on leftover salad leaf and chicken!!! (Strike 3).They didn't wash the glasses, utensils and dishes properly. I was so disgusted!!! I wasn't going to say anything and be whatever it happens. So Elizabeth gave us the bill and that's when our patience ran out. she charged us for mango tea that she never got me. She put in a glass of Cabernet and burger sliders which we never ordered. The wonton tacos and spin dip was suppose to be half off and they weren't. That's when I told her I appreciate that she made me the root beer float but I was very disgusted of what I found and had put in my mouth. I even showed her and nothing really happened. Manager didn't bother on coming out to apologize and make things right. they didn't offer anything to fix the situation. So we said f*** it and just fix the bill. We told her but it took her 3x to get it right. Like really?? You fed me dishwasher leftover chicken salad,  neglected bringing us the essentials, forgot my drink and messed up my bill. We were so irritated. Gave us our change without the receipt so we asked for our receipt and they gave us a hard time with that! I work in the industry and I know shady tactics so we demanded for the receipt. (Strike OUT FOR LIFE!)   FYI, We were actually enjoying ourselves and looked pass the forgotten drink and slow neglecting service but it all went to hell after dessert. Yuck! NEVER AGAIN!   I know it's not entirely our servers fault and this place failed as a restaurant. I blame the manager that night. I never saw the manager step out the restaurant. She only went out to override the computers but never checked on floor/tables and customers. The situation could've been turned around. poor management equals poor service and poor work ethic through out the establishment. This restaurant is a disgrace."}
{"text":"If I could give this place NO STARS I would. My brothers and I took my Mom their once for their birthday and waited about 30 minutes for someone else with the same amount of people in their party to get seated before us when they had arrived after. The girl that was in charge of putting us down on the list totally forgot to do so. We only figured this out when my brother when to ask her how much longer we would be waiting she looked at him super confused like what are you talking about your not on the list but with out having to say anything. I got so mad that we just left and went ac cross the street to Friday's unfortunately is not longer open. I will not be going their ever again tried to report them to corporate and I couldn't find a way to do it."}
{"text":"Seated quickly. After 10 minutes of waiting for a server to order drinks I went looking for him.  After order placed waited another 10 minutes for drinks.  30 minutes in and the incorrect appetizer brought to our table.  Left cash for drinks and left.  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Great server but when I come in with a toddler I expect a children's menu. I asked twice and never got one. There were 5 tables at the time in the restaurant. I get it, I'm in the business too. But not to check on you or ask if you need anything is why I will not be coming back. Day severs I guess"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we were given a gift card. I will say that the front door is a little awkward to locate from the parking lot but we eventually got in. Our waitress, from the get go, was funny and fun to talk with. We enjoyed her interaction with us!    Other than my steak coming out medium to well done, rather than medium rare, the food was very good! I will say that even though the steak was over cooked, it was still very tender and tasted great, which usually doesn't happen when it is over cooked!  We would come back here and eat again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Applebee's many times in the past, their Fiesta Lime Chicken being one of my favourite dishes. I need to eat gluten free and in the past the Fiesta Lime Chicken was marked gluten free on the menu. Now it wasn't. I was going to inquire about this but decided to take the opportunity to try their ribs which are gluten free. I ordered a small order of their Riblets. The sauce was tasty enough but I could not find but a few shreds of meat on the ribs. Fortunately the fries were quite good so I did get something to eat. I won't be ordering ribs at Applebee's again, if I ever return.  This is definitely a candidate for my \"worst meal of the year\" award for 2018."}
{"text":"Wish  I could give 0 stars. The employees are rude, loud and ghetto. The good is always cold. After ordering car side and waiting in my car for 15 minutes I have to go in and wait some more. The food is never right. I will never come back. Unfortunately this is close to my work so it was convenient. I would rather eat at burger king.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Came here for late night happy hour. Had the $1 Bahama Mamas and chicken tacos. Good food for happy hour. The bartender Tracy was amazing! She has great people skills. She moves fast and keeps the counters clean. I will come back to this Applebee's just for her customer service."}
{"text":"we are first time customers and wanted an early dinner.   there were only about 3 tables and 2 bar patrons in the restaurant ... the bartender was our waitress.   my guest ordered the triple bacon burger & fries ... $10.99   i ordered the salmon dinner ..$14.99     after about 20 minutes i asked where our dinner was ... our server was at the bar talking to someone ...  after getting her attention she rushed into the kitchen and brought us our slighly warm meal.   it was sitting for awhile waiting for her to pick up.    the burger had 2 slices of bacon on top ... what makes it a triple bacon burger?  on the platter for the burger were a small handful of french fries ... enough for a childs porton.     my salmon was very well cooked and only warm and very dry.    it looked nothing like the picture on the menu and it was a small slab of salmon .... very sad.    i asked for the manager and she was very graceful and after showing her the diet triple cheeseburger ... she brought out more fries and bacon ...  she did ask to help the salmon,  but we were hungry and  eat it and thanked her anyway.     your happy hour has $3 bud light ... i got a miller lite because you had no bud light ... charged $4 mot the $3 happy hour prices ...   your food looks great on the television ...$46.50 + tip not too much value here ... pass this along to your staff ... we hope to try it again ..."}
{"text":"Ok...here goes:  We ordered the appetizer sampler and EVERYTHING WAS JUST RIGHT!! We have all had that one platter where some stuff is under-cooked and the rest mediocre, right? Not this time...  My son ordered the Quesidilla Burger...nice presentation, I wish I had thought to snap pics before we all started. He said it was cooked just right.  My mother had a turkey & avocado sandwich with fries...huge sandwich that I seriously doubt she will finish. (Great--there's lunch).  I ordered something from the low calorie selections...don't remember it's name, but it had a steak, potatoes, stuffed portabello mushroom cap with spinach and Parmesan cheese. It tasted great.  Overall I gave it 4 stars only because  1) the air was cranked up and I was cold most of the time 2) my plate didn't look as appetizing as it tasted..again steak was well seasoned 3) the calorie counts were on a sheet that the server had to bring to me....overdue for them to have all of that info ON THE MENU.  But I will certainly come again!"}
{"text":"Can't say much when the service and the food was just terrible going downhill quickly and we live very close never going back again Olive Garden beats it all the way around."}
{"text":"Killer happy hour deals!!! 1/2 off appetizers! I'm not a big drinker but they have some killer deals on drinks too! The service was quick, table was clean and enjoyed a late lunch, early dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Our server Ray was great with a great attitude. The menu has changed since our last trip to Applebee's and it was a refreshing change. The American BLT was very good.  My burger was done just right and the blonde brownie was wonderful."}
{"text":"Ok, so I do not eat at applebees often at all however we ordered applebees for lunch and I got the southwest chicken salad with my lunch special. OMG the best f% ¬Ä;!^@ salad I think I have ever had. Make sure you ask for an extra dressing though. It has a little bit of spice to it but ohhhh so good. If they ever take this off the menu I do not think id ever eat here again. Oh and we only got it for pickup so not really sure about all of the customer service or anything, but that salad!!!! I think im going to go get another one tonight lol."}
{"text":"Horrible disgusting food.. Old meat and Hair in my food ... Ew don't go to this apple bees. Not clean and they are sloppy with the orders . Poor example of how apple bees should be"}
{"text":"My friends and I learned our lesson to go to somewhere better for good customer service instead of coming here for drinks. The drink I got I didn't like it at all because it was extremely sweet and I could barely taste any alcohol in it. My friends tried it and they agreed with me. When I asked a waitress walking around if I could change it she said no because the drink I have is the one with the most alcohol on the menu and if I don't like it I would have to pay for it and pay for the new one. You go central bistro, postinos, st. Francis (which are places around that area) they will exchange your drink if you don't like it for free which will make us want to give them a bigger tip, but I guess cheaper places are too cheap for that. I recommend the other places I just named rather then coming here for food that isn't half as good as those places !"}
{"text":"Got a gift card for them and I got exactly what I expected when I went. Greasy food, screaming children and a stomach ache. Great staff tho;]"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Have been to this place a hand full of times. Received good service twice and bad service thee times. Steak was good, chicken salad awe full. Music was good. Will not be going back. Don't like Russian roulette with eateries."}
{"text":"We we arrived it was about a 15 minute wait and there was plenty of booths, tables and at the bar yet people were still waiting. One meal was brought with onion rings extra charge, I waited 45 minutes for my friends meal, when I finally came there were no onion rings, she took my cold meal back and brought another with fries. We canceled the dessert that took 30 minutes for the waitress to remember it never came. She insisted  we have it after telling her no. On the bill we were charged for 2 sides of onion rings, 1.99 for a game (?) and the dessert.  After complaining about the cold food, charges for onion rings and the dessert we didnt want, the Manager Vincente brought the new bill, with 2 orders of onion rings and dessert. Eventually they gave us our meal on the house. After sitting there for 2 hours for 2 burgers that was the least they could do. We will never be going back to that Applebee's  or any other Applebee's."}
{"text":"I wanted take a moment to give a shout out to Applebee's.  i do not eat out often, so it is important that I have a good experience.  I was so pleased last Thursday when Applebee's exceeded my expectations.  The service was outstanding, as good as you would receive in a five star restaurant.   Our server was so professional, well informed, timely and pleasant, it added so much to the experience.  I did not order a lot, my tab was under 15.00.  The service was worth that alone.  I will go back to this Applebee's.  Such a great experience."}
{"text":"Applebee's is a chain restaurant and once you've been there you pretty much know what to expect. One guest in our party had the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi. The kitchen was happy to substitute the chicken for shrimp as requested. However, At $11.99 the meal could at least come with a couple breadsticks or side salad. Compare this to Olive Garden's chicken Alfredo at $14.99 that comes with unlimited breadsticks and salad. Another member of the party had the heart healthy Thai shrimp salad. At 370 cal it is spicy and satisfying with a decent portion of grilled spicy shrimp. The steak on another's steak salad was nicely medium rare. Service was friendly and prompt on that Sunday for a 2:00 lunch."}
{"text":"Good service and nice environment  ! I can't wait to come back , the employees were friendly and food were great!"}
{"text":"This is my sons absolutely favorite place to eat! I love the new menu , so many fun new choices! What I love most about Applebee's is the prices !! So reasonable for a family night out . Service is always really good , food is great and very clean !"}
{"text":"Applebee's has gone downhill so far, they may never make it back up again. And no, don't blame the \"millennials\" and no I am NOT a millennial. Applebee's your food just sucks these days. My daughter, grandson and I went about a month ago, the visit was disappointing and thought maybe a one off night. We went back 11/8/2017 and nothing but disappointment once again. Both times the steak we got for our growing boy was nothing but nasty bundle of gristle. Very poor quality. I used to always order the ribs...but no more because there is \"no more\" meat on the bones. I literally got a plate of bones. Very apparent they buy bottom of the barrel grades of meat. The prices have gone up the food quality has gone done. We will never go back to Applebee's again. If Applebee's closes up and dies, it's because their food is horrible these days...not because of a Millennial. This location used to be my \"happy hour\" place but Applebee's has also destroyed happy hour, it's not happy, it's just an hour these days. When they took the boneless wings off the HH menu is when I ceased to spend my hour there."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! First off they took forever for the drinks, second our server wasn't even serving our food our our drinks half the time, it was other servers, and third we had a party of 7 and all of us did the 2 for 25 and when our food came out everyone's came out except for mine, so while everyone started eating there food I had to sit and extra fifteen minutes to for them to bring my food out, the only experience I really got out of it was that it was nice inside and also it wasn't loud, but other than that it was a horrible service I tipped twenty dollars because servers live off of there tips but still it was just one of there locations I will not be going to at all and I highly recommend taking my advice and doing the same thing, please do not go to this location"}
{"text":"Dan the man! I usually watch football on Sundays and Mondays. Always sit at the bar, Dan the bartender is always on top of it. Super friendly, always hustling, and you can't beat the happy hour prices. Half off domestics/half off appetizers. This is definitely my spot for Sunday/Monday night games."}
{"text":"As crazy as it sounds,  this was only my second time at Applebee.  My experience was five star! Wonton tacos, boneless Asian wings, and steak quesadilla were so yummy! But the best part about my experience was our waitress Brittany. She made our time so amazing we are going bad next week! If you go to this location, ask for her."}
{"text":"Portions very small food was very bland dying for salt My wife ordered a drink waitress never checked in for refills appetizers were brought out 2 mins before entrees because waitress forgot  them first time eating here would never go back"}
{"text":"Great food tonight, haven't been in a while, new menu items very nice, had ribs, needed a tad more sauce, but very good. Server was great, fast service, very nice attitude. Jerome has great people skills. Overall nice meal, get your friends head over its worth the trip."}
{"text":"They are going through a remodeling phase right now so the atmosphere is kinda weird. And the food never looks like the pictures!!"}
{"text":"I genuinely like Applebee's so it's not a stretch for me to give it 4 stars. Rhonda, the manager checked on us twice......before we ordered and as we ate. Our waitress was outstanding.......attentive, friendly, but not overly so.  My whiskey barrel sirloins were cooked to med well perfection. I know there have been some bad reviews here at the Brimfield Applebee's, but I've eaten here twice on visits to Kent and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and honestly don't know if I'll ever come back. We've been here a few times before with no real issues but today was awful. We had Amber as our server and since she had a very large group, she felt she didn't need to care for her other tables. She took our order and that was the last we saw of her. I understand the money comes from larger groups,  but that doesn't give you any reason not to care for your other tables. So very upsetting. I am, however, very grateful for the manager, Tiffany who listened to our concerns and continued to help us until we left. She's the reason I gave 3 stars. If we do return, I will definitely be ensuring Amber is not our server. She was nice and all but couldn't manage the demand of having a few tables."}
{"text":"Are there last night. Service snd food was awesome.  I highly recommend this Location."}
{"text":"Okay food and terrible service.  Usually we go the Applebee's off of Grand Avenue and we have always had great food and pretty good service.  We did not have a good experience at the Bell Road location today.  We arrived at around 1pm and there were already 2 couples waiting ahead of us to be seated and the hostess was nowhere around.  When she did finally show up she looked to the 4th set of people that were walking in the door behind us and asked them if they would like to be seated.  What the heck?  There was a line of people clearly there before them and she just seated them first.  Then she came back and asked the 2nd couple in line to follow her back to be seated.  After another few minutes another girl came in and seated the first couple that was waiting and then came back for us.    Once we finally got to our table and our waitress came the service was fine.  However, when we were leaving the couple at the table next to us was complaining to the manager that they had been waiting over an hour for their food.  The manager replied that it \"happens sometimes\" when they are busy.  I didn't hear him offer any apology or an offer to see what happened with their food or compensate them in any way, just an excuse for slow service and he walked away.  Obviously the lack of customer service at this location comes froom the top down."}
{"text":"With this being the only local chain that keeps their menu fresh and up to date it is busy with a long wait during the evening and weekends. Food is good service has been above average with one exception which is the hostess station. The youngsters at the hostess station are not very attentive they consistently take elderly or visibly handicapped guests to hightops then are disgusted when customers ask for more suitable accommodations. Been to this location a good bit due to convenience."}
{"text":"Always try to give this place a chance once a year and EVERYTIME we are completely let down! Total disappointment.  Food is always bad and never looks like the menu. This is the last time we will be at Applebee's.   OH AND THEY NO LONGER HAVE \"RIBLETS\" why would you get rid of the ONE thing that put you on the map."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food. I did the 2 for 27 meal with my Mom and we got the spinach artichoke chip, she got I believe a bourbon chicken meal and I got the buffalo tender Mac and cheese. The food was all good but the service is where they missed the mark. Our server, Dylan, was way more concerned with playing grab-ass with the host than he was with waiting tables. She was also putting everybody in his section and I think she should have been spreading them out a bit. He walked past our table multiple times when my drink was empty and never even checked on us let alone refill my drink. He finally decided to refill it at the end of the meal. The nail in the coffin was calling me \"hun\". Gross. You don't know me, don't give me a pet name. I get that it's Applebee's and it was a really random, out-of-the-way trip for us so we probably won't be back any time soon but Dylan and the antics of the host pretty much solidified that decision."}
{"text":"Food was not good at all today. I ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they were warm. As a meal I ordered the four cheese Mac and cheese and that came out cold. The plate was warmer than the actual food. I don't think I have ever been disappointed with my food. I work in the restaurant business and food should never be served cold to a patron. Giving this place one star because I have to rate it."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre not very good at all I was really disappointed In the quality as I have eaten at this Applebee's before and gotten really good service but this last time they fell really short hope the next time I go they nail it"}
{"text":"We used to like coming to this location,  we always sit at the bar and usually love the bartenders, Autumn(?) was our favorite. Today is the first time coming back in about 6 months.  HORRIBLE X 100. The bartender (Kara) had the worst attitude ever for customer service. She rolled her eyes while another customer complained that their order was still not right after 30 minutes,  she got my drink order wrong twice and gave me a dirty plate but still had an attitude that she didn't even try to hide.   Ridiculous. I don't know that is all her fault though, the entire restaurant seems to have gone completely downhill.  The employees wear earpieces and talk loudly to each other and managememt right between customers at the bar and have no concept of customer service.  Karen and Rayna were the only positive parts of todays experience.  Truly disappointed. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight. We chose it because I'm on a diet. The chicken caprese was super yum and only 700 calories. The staff was efficient and fast. Enjoyed our evening and didn't blow my diet.the bathroom was very clean and smelled good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a huge disappointment and does not live up to the chains reputation. The waitress was non attentive they brought out cold clumped rice and the rest of the food was not much better. So much for there \"high tech\" gadget to call the server.  Ten minutes later she finally showed up after the others in the party were finished and offered to get a new plate. Then the manager came over acting all defensive and took off a portion of the meal that was sent back.  The whole restaurant staff from top to bottom needs re-training."}
{"text":"Love this place. Go here every couple weeks with business associates and always have great service and great food. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Miserable experience. Not only did we wait over 30 minutes for our drinks, but I was the one who picked them up from the bar. Identical entrees came out with a 15 minute difference, with half of the food being cold. The salads that were ordered as appetizers came after the cold meals, and our server did not bring any sauces or condiments that came with the meal. The manager had a blank expression, and was simply rude. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat on Rockside."}
{"text":"today there wasn't many people there, yet the service was really slow :(  like really really slow :("}
{"text":"I can truly say I experienced both good and bad at this location. They've had several changes to their menu; all for the better.  If you want a good experience request Yadi! I've never had an issue or concern. She's very pleasant and attentive. The only reason why I frequent this location."}
{"text":"The music playing in the background was a nice touch. Too bad it wasn't Foreigner's \"Cold As Ice\", as it was rather chilly inside. You could hear patrons throughout commenting on just how cold it was. Our server, Teri, was friendly, knowledgable and helpful. The food was out quickly. I opted for the Quesadilla Burger, which was fresh and flavorful as were the french fries. The iced tea, however, was not so fresh and had an odd taste. They have some TV's for viewing the sport de jour and I heard the waiter run through a long list of beers for the table behind me. There are other places in the area I would be more apt to visit, but Applebee's is worth a return trip. Nothing to warrant less than three stars, but nothing to justify a four star on this visit either."}
{"text":"Small plate with so few food on it. And plus, they gave me a cheap to go cup for my drink saying they ran out of clean cups, while giving the table with a bunch of frat guys next to me regular cups. What the heck???? Really discriminative. Never ever go there again."}
{"text":"staff was awesome ...manager harlen stinnet took care of me and my family ... will be going back again soon! general manager angela centeno was amazing ! thx guys for a great experience !"}
{"text":"I was here the other night with my family and we opted for the 2 for $25 deal noted in their menu.  This offer comes with two main entrees and one appetizer, which I thought wasn't such a bad deal.  For my main dish, I ordered the Double Crunch Shrimp and my husband ordered the Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger.  My parents both ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad.  The appetizers we selected were the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and my parents had the Onion Rings.  Let's start with the appetizers:  Although I was impressed with the size of the Spinach and Artichoke Dip appetizer, I was not impressed with the flavour!  It was quite bland and had more cheese than spinach... and I don't think the artichoke even made an appearance!  I'm also not quite sure why it came with a small dish of salsa on the side... seemed like an odd combination.  The onion rings, although large and crispy didn't seem to compare in value to the dip (see pictures attached)... but I must say, they did restore my faith after the John Anderson's onion ring debacle (see previous review).  On to the mains:  The Double Crunch Shrimp consisted of 12 breaded shrimp, cocktail sauce, fries and coleslaw.  I'm not sure what justified the name of 'Double Crunch' though as there wasn't really much crunch to them at all.  The fries were so bland that they weren't even worth eating.  I think the only saving grace for this dish was the cocktail sauce (to give some flavour to the shrimp) and the coleslaw.  The Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger came with all the usual condiments and I must say, the bacon was cooked perfectly.  Sadly to say, even though the burger was flavourful, it was really dry... and we won't even get back into talking about the fries.  The saving grace for this dish was the salsa that came with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip... perhaps this is what added the flavour to the burger...?  On to the Oriental Chicken Salad.  This dish left a lot to be desired.  The chicken had far too much breading and was extremely dry.  The lettuce wasn't even a nice mix of greens, it was just romaine.  Romaine!  That's it!  Are you trying to tell me that there are no other types of lettuce in the orient?  C'mon!  There was so much more they could have done to this dish... I'm not even sure why it was called 'oriental'.  The saving grace for this dish was the dressing.  It had a really nice consistency and was quite sweet.  I can't say that I'll be back.  Applebee's used to have good quality food for a good price.  I feel that the quality of the food has gone down in direct relationship to the rise in prices.  There are far better restaurants out there for me to spend my money at.  Last, but not least... the saving grace for the whole evening was the service.  Our waitress was pleasant and cheerful.  She even presented my Dad with a free dessert for his birthday.  Happy Birthday Dad... sorry we picked such a shoddy restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty bad.  I was given 2 Applebee's gift certificates, meaning I've been forced there multiple times.  The Food: It's typical Applebee's food, not great, just good...although, my coveted artichoke dip was cold last time.  Alcohol:  The bartender's suck, I ordered a \"Long Beach\" two separate times and the first time it tasted purely of tequila (WTF?), the second time I ordered it with a kicker (that the bartender recommended) but it tasted purely of sugar...and I don't mind sugary drinks but this was bad.  The Service: Probably the best part of the restaurant, very friendly in my experience (the reason for the second star).  Management: incredibly unorganized, managers clearly disliked their jobs, one told us how ghetto the clientele is...which is probably true considering some of the stories I've heard...  In essence, the food is hit or miss, the alcohol sucks, and literally most of the management hates their lives...do yourself a favor and go somewhere where there's a little TLC put into the place..."}
{"text":"Food is good service the worst I live 1 block away from this place and I rather drive 20 minutes to a different location than this one they serve you food with out utensils no napkins and they don't even let you say something they just walk away. My wife was drinking a margarita and wanted another one, my daughter wanted dessert but waiter just brought us check and walked away. Take my word this place is awful we have been here previously on a week night and service is just as bad."}
{"text":"When you order a full rack of ribs to go make sure you check before leaving. My daughter picked up our meal and surprise surprise I received a half rack... that's something that should not be messed up.  Lame applebees you owe me like four bucks."}
{"text":"I've been to some pretty ghetto, hood-like places in my day and I am not proud of this but never in my life have I ever been served such stale tortilla chips like my Lord. I realize that it's Applebee's and it's 1. Redneck City and 2. Not in any type of tortilla chip business but really? I almost lost teeth.   But my entree was good and my server was friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this Applebee's location, the waitress did a great service a give her 5 stars , but to the food just 1 I was very disappointed when I saw my plate but I also was very hungry, I ate part, and my husband look at me like 'it's not good ?  And I said no but I'm so hungry."}
{"text":"Blugh...I hate national chains but my treat and friends made the choice... I got the shimp pasta and I know... MINE IS BETTER!!!!! Lacking flavour and stupid small portions at $12.95 NO SIDE!!!!! Another buck fifty for fries that kinda helped fill me up.... Got home and had a REAL meal... Don't waste your time..."}
{"text":"Food was great went during lunch hour. Waited awhile to get our food. Then took forever to get our check. We were done eating then finally told my sister to take the check up. That too took forever. Our only Applebee's near work. I believe in second chances. We will try another day if the same poor customer service then we will stick to bringing our lunch to work."}
{"text":"The customer service was absolutely horrible, we waited for over 25 minutes(while she was talking to another coworker) for our server to come around and even acknowledge us so my kid could get a refill, when you upset my kid because you could not perform the responsibilities of your job, I will tell you exactly how I feel and make sure every hears me...DO NOT IGNORE YOUR CUSTOMERS....People will get pissed, I hope she was terminated immediately"}
{"text":"We have had great service here every time we visit this place. The trio of apps are good and we always get the fiesta salad. YUM!  No complaints here and yes we will go back."}
{"text":"Nice place it was the only place open late, but I wasn't too found of the food. I had the 2 for $20: Chips w/spinach artichoke dip and grilled chicken wonton tacos. The tacos wasn't too bad actually."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I ordered a white wine spritzer, the server told me I don't think we carry that, I don't know these fancy drink names. I told her what it was and that it's been around forever. My wife ordered a frozen strawberry lemonade and got a regular. When ordering our food she laughed when I specified no poblano peppers or any spice. I ordered a weight watchers meal as I wasn't too terribly starving. When our food came she just assumed that my wife who is larger than I wanted the weight watchers. I was completely appalled. I spoke to the manager at once told her everything and explained we were leaving and I was paying for nothing. Next time I visit Phoenix this will not be where I go."}
{"text":"Just came from Applebee's,  had bone in chicken wings and chips and artichoke dip. Chips and artichoke dip was ok, nothing special. But the wings were covered in hot sauce, it was so thick was not appealing. The guy, not my waitress, dropped off our appetizers and said he w a going to bring plates, never saw him again...no one asked about our food no extra napkins for wings, nothing. Self check out,so they don't have to hear how bad the food is...the waitress seemed rushed..that's too bad Applebee's you could be better."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on the weekend with family, just a party of 2 nothing complicated.  Was expecting to have a good lunch, but unfortunately service wasn't good that day.  Our order was incorrectly taken as we had ordered steak, but got chicken instead.  So one of us had food, while the other waited for their order to come out.  When we went to pay our bill, something went wrong with their computer/register and it took forever to get receipt printed.  Server and staff apologized, but unsure if we'll be back.  The only thing we liked that tasted great was an appetizer, the chicken wonton tacos."}
{"text":"It took our server here AN HOUR AND A HALF (90 minutes) to get the bill separated.  Our server was visibly and audibly having a psychological breakdown, unable to handle a party of 10 with appetizers and drinks for each person. She sat down at the table multiple times, drawing diagrams and equations so complex and confusing I can't even imagine. She was openly complaining to us about her other tables and constantly delivering drinks to the wrong person.   This one star is strictly due to the service. The food and drinks are decent quality and moderately priced so in any other situation I'm sure it would've been three even four stars...."}
{"text":"The service was slow the lady who greeted took us to a table ididnt like iasked her if icould get a booth she said No right away. Iasked can find out if get one shes like well you have to wait 10min. Our waiter was nice and refill our drinks often, the food took at least 1hr. When food arrived forgotten my veggies iasked the lady she said ok bring it, Never brought finished my food. Food Was Ok,"}
{"text":"My 12 oz sirloin was at least 4oz of fat. Gross. Pathetic, really.  Also pathetic, someone from the kitchen delivered food to another patron. The patron asked a question, and the kitchen attendant answered the question while walking away, making zero eye contact.  Poor product. Poor service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Never eating here again!  From beginning to end, our family's experience here was just plain horrible.  It was our first time going to this location. We walked in & the entrance is odd.  It didn't resemble restaurant entry ways that we've ever been to.  We entered & just saw dining tables.  There was a small table, attempting to look like a starting point for diners go to request to be seated but nothing that stood out like other places. When we entered there was no employee in sight.  After waiting a bit, employee #1 came & told us to follow her.  We tried to tell her that we just walked in but she just kept on walking.  Another employee came & we explained that we just walked in & the employee #1 must have mistaken us for another group.  Employee #2 called employee #1 back & asked her what group she was seating.  She pointed to us & said, (name), party of 8.  It was just me, my husband, & our 2 children.  Employee #2 walks to the \"waiting area\" (that you can't see when entering unless you walk around the corner) & calls the name out.  Thankfully that was worked out.  Employee #1 sat us & unfortunately for us, she was our waitress for our meal.   She seemed pleasant at first.  She introduced herself, took our order for drinks, & didn't come back for 20 min.  My husband had to get up to go find her to ask about our drinks.  (It was not a busy night by any means).  Our waitress told us that the kitchen were backed up with orders (I'm going to mention again that it was not a busy night.  Plenty of empty tables) & she can't believe it's taking them so long.  She complained about the other staff & she complained about working there.  We politely listened to her ongoing rant.  When she finally finished we asked her for our drinks & also asked that she take our order (fearing we wouldn't see her again for another 20 min).  She took our order & almost 15 min later she arrives with our drinks.  Another 15 min we got bored so we checked out the table tablets they had.  Pretty cool!  Had games to keep the kids busy.  We checked out the dessert menu & asked another waitress passing by, if we ordered dessert, if it would come after our main courses.  She said yes so we ordered. We literally got our dessert 10 minutes by a very friendly & upbeat gentleman.   Our waitress just happened to walk by so we snagged her & asked her when our main course meals would be coming.  She saw our desserts, rolled her eyes, and walked away.   We ate our desserts & our meals finally came.  We asked for boxes & our bill, packed up our food, & paid for our meal on the tablet.  It was all we could do to get of there.  We love Applebee's but this location needs some serious work.  Hopefully they can get it together.  My family & I will never know firsthand because we will never return. Dessert was awesome!  Food was mediocre.   Food plus extremely poor service, big thumbs down!!"}
{"text":"Great service from Christian. The truth is sometimes I just want good old WT food. The food is greasy and good. To many people want to rate places by comparing them to one of the best steakhouses. I try to rate it for what it is. It's a good place to go for some good greasy food. I enjoyed everything I had there!"}
{"text":"The food was good. But the service was not the greatest...  Not a romantic place. But for a cheap place with decent food not place to go. Happy Hour deals are decent as well."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place has, THE WORST service. I first, waited 10 minutes to be asked what I wanted to drink. There was only 2 tables with people on my section. Let's just say....IT WAS SLOW!!! After ordering my drinks and food, I was told they didn't have wild berry Frozen lemonade, so my daughter chose Mango instead. It took 15 minutes to get a drink  Anywho, the  food was GREAT. We got the chicken and artichoke. No complaints there. The service was not good! Our server, was vacuuming the whole time I was there and she asked did I want a refill, literally 3 minutes before I was about to leave. I will DEFINITELY not come back to this particular Applebee's. I was not happy but AGAIN, the food was AWESOME! The 2 stars are for the food."}
{"text":"Wow... I eat here all the time with my family and we always receive good service but today the service was less than satisfactory. Our waitress Kaitlynn H took 10 minutes to take our drink order and we are her only table... she never checked on us. I had to get another waitress to get her for us to complain about the stale fries that we had. She replaced the fries and they were stale AGAIN. She said that she told the manager but when we asked her what her manager said she forgot what her manager told her... really?... And then she gave us our check right away. Um, hello? I'm still eating and my family will be ordering dessert. I feel like she just wants to get us in and out like damn... If you don't want to be here or if you're having a messed up day then you should check yourself at the door or stay home.   Today's service was a FAIL."}
{"text":"So disappointing .. Service was not good altho the waiter was very nice.. He took another table order when we were there first but assured us ours would go in first..  WE had not been here in a year because the food was so bad the last time.. Steak was raw and cold, broccoli not even cooked, mashed potatoes cold in center and inedible.. it was bad.. But we decided to give it another chance.. My salad was good except it had hardly any dressing on it.. and the waiter never returned to ask if everything was ok.. He was too interested in other tables.. It ws the oriental chicken salad.. Then we had our aarp card which gives a 15% senior discount but when we showed it to the waiter he goes what is that , I don't know what that is.. He was really rude.. Then he goes I need to get my manager.. So the manager comes over and says I can only give you 10% i showed him the website from aarp stating 15% he goes i don't have a 15% button.. duh i was in retail for 25 years customer service and this was not customer service.. He goes I can give you 10% .. He was rude as well .. Then i look up and on the wall is a sign We Love our Seniors lol are you kidding me??? Needless to say there are so many wonderful restaurants around we do not need to go there to be treated this way and spend money there.."}
{"text":"Worst place ever !!!  Our waitress was one of the worst she never even bother to come and check on our table.  Took 10 min just to get our drinks. And all we order was water.  Asked her for lemon for our waters and didn't even bring them. The food was not like the other Applebee's we won't be going back there again that's for sure horrible place to eat.  Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Food is par for the course, the curbside pickup is a joke.  10-15 min wait times after the eta.  Why even bother."}
{"text":"I don't ever really expect quality food at Applebees, but I do expect good selections and light options.   They did not disappoint.     I had a shrimp and veggie bowl and my girlfriend had the steak salad.  We had the Wonton chicken tacos for apps and they were awesome.  Good service, but it was slow and in the middle of the day.  Good place for lunch and apps."}
{"text":"I had gift card given to me and thought I would hit this place up for lunch via though carside to go option.  We got the 2 for 20 deal. I had the steak, mixed veggies, and mashed potatoes. I never had a steak that tasted that salty EVER before plus they were off the temperature as well. A little overly done. The mixed veggies were so soft you could very gentle press the fork down and it would be made into mush fit for a baby. The potatoes were alright but nothing to great.   My husband got the Riblets, we must have gotten a crappy batch cause they were so little meat actually on them. He was pretty much just chewing a flavored piece of bone and fat. The sauce tasted like one out of a bottle you can get at a store.  The waitress was nice and bought the food out of the car pretty fast, that is the only reason why they didn't get 1 star."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad experience.   I like their new menu with the toppers.  My GF got the steak topped with the fried Bacon Onions.  The broccoli looked a little old and the steak was a little tough.  Overall I believe it was $13.99 which isn't bad.  She got the 6oz steak.  I got the Shrimp Asian bowl thing.  I asked for no Muchrooms but of course a few snuck in.  It tasted a little bland, not like I remembered from the other Applebees in Phoenix.   Waitress and manager came over and they did a great job.  Place was nice and clean.  It was a Saturday around noon so we were sat right away.  An average lunch.  Tab came to $40 as we did get an app."}
{"text":"Just had lunch in their newly remodeled store.  This was by far the worst lunch we've had in quite some time.  Server brought my order and not my dining partner's.   The waitress checked back later and said the other order was \"dropped\" and was reordered. Both food orders were awful.  It is hard to ruin a simple hamburger and onion rings but they managed quite easily.  The table behind us had their order messed up too.   We will definitely NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss each time...  I've had 5 star visits and 1 star visits here. Food wise it is very consistent.. Service wise amazing or just plain horrible!"}
{"text":"Nice staff and we're ready to help our party of 7 which was very nice. The waitress was helpful explaining the happy hour menu which is nice when you are trying to save a dollar or 2 lol The food came out right away and it was all very good! We only had appetizers no entrees, but we were all very pleased with the taste. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars was because we were not asked if we wanted a second round of drinks which we did so we all just needed up drinking our water. Other than that the experience was good and the restaurant was clean which is a plus."}
{"text":"Weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar. However, we went with a group of friends for the Veteran's Day deal where they provided a free meal to veterans. I was meeting someone for lunch later so I only had a drink, everyone else ordered a meal(including the veterans in our group). Here we are 2 days later and every single person, that ate there all have flu symptoms. I feel fine and coincidentally I didn't order anything to eat. Some line cook was probably sick and they wouldn't let him call out since they were busy for the holiday. Way to give some veterans the flu with their free meal Applebee's!"}
{"text":"Hate on me all you want for patronizing a chain restaurant, but sometimes a girl just needs a quick dessert fix and Applebee's Butter Pecan Blondie does not disappoint! Ugh that stuff is sooooo good!   For $5.49 you get a warm blond brownie with glazed pecans, vanilla ice cream, and this like maple glaze sauce to drizzle all over it. Mmm! Usually I take pictures, but there was no time, this dessert needed to be eaten stat!  The five stars is only for the Butter Pecan Blondie, I can't speak on the other food they serve."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning ... enough said.    No more reheater places for me!  Well as long as the wife doesn't force me."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service! I went in today and waited at the  host stand for almost 5 minutes while employees watched me wait and no one came to seat me. I then proceeded to sit at the bar and the bartender said she would be with me shortly. I waited and 10 minutes later, I didn't have a menu nor did she ask for my drink order. I then watched her sit the next group that came in at the host stand and she still hadn't came back to check on me or bring anything....something similar happened the last time I visited this location so I WILL NOT be back. It wasn't even busy so There wasn't an excuse for the poor service"}
{"text":"Had dinner there a couple of weeks ago with my wife,daughter and 2 grandkids. Everybody enjoyed the food and overall experience. Nice to know what to expect when traveling."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at Applebee's last week.  I got there first, and was seated at a table where I could check out the menu items before my friend arrived.  The waitress politely answered all of my questions about the menu.  I decided to order the fish and chips and received what I would consider to be a generous portion of haddock served with fries on a platter.  My friend ordered the same.  Both of us were very happy with the taste of the food and the size of the portions.  It only took about ten minutes to get our food delivered to our table after we placed our order.  We consider this to be very fast service, since it was a Friday night, and the place was quite busy.  All in all, we had a very enjoyable time.  I had a Strawberry Daiquiri, and my friend had a virgin Strawberry Daiquiri.  The drinks were excellent.  With the two meals, drinks and one tea for me, the cost was about $46.  Overall, we enjoyed our meals, the ambiance of the restaurant, and the efficiency of the wait staff.  We will definitely go back again.    This is the perfect location to meet up with friends, or to have something to eat after shopping at the nearby Sunridge Mall."}
{"text":"Friday my daughter and I went here for lunch - shared mozzarella sticks and both got sick. Tuesday I was in there and told the manager on duty - - he didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Very POOR service. One person in the party got grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't even melted. Waitress seemed out of it and didn't care AT ALL. Ordered a medium well cowboy burger. It was RAW!! Wasn't the first time food has gone back here and the fact that 2 out 3 orders in one sitting went back was ridiculous. It wasn't even a crowded night."}
{"text":"It's never been a great place, but it's unfortunately gotten worse. We had the American Standard burgers which were possibly the most greasy burgers either of us have had from any joint we've been to.  It oozed out of the burger and ran down our hands and forearms.  Also, if you want lettuce, tomatoes, onions or pickles which are expected to come automatically with your burger, you have to ask for it.  We had the appy of boneless chicken tenders which had maybe 40% breast meat. The sauce was hot, pretty good.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay I guess. The service was terrible. Couldn't even get silverware without asking even after food was on the table. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty pricey for what you are getting, a chicken Caesar salad will set you back $12. I ordered a chicken Caesar car-side to go and they didn't put the chicken in it, so I paid $12 for lettuce and croutons. When I called them the manager said she would send me a gift certificate to use the next time I came in, but she never sent it. The inside dining area is relatively clean, but the service has been lacking, slow and forgetting to bring things."}
{"text":"Applebee's is so stinking good. Pretty solid!  I'd recommend waiting until reverse happy hour at 9pm to come in for a late night snack because they have half off appetizers and drinks which is a steal.   Their Crispy Oriental Chicken Salad is great but their wings, spin dip, salsa, and nachos are great. I have had their steak which isn't too shabby.  I love their pomegranate perfect margarita. They bring it in a shaker for you to pour for yourself. Cool!  I had a mudslide to finish off my feast and sheesh. This place just has it all.  Eatin' good in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Butcher's Meat and its ties was very good. Great value too. Dawn was an excellent server."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by today after our workout to get an order of salad because we wanted something light for dinner. The minute we stepped in, I heard my favorite country song playing and following by many more wonderful country songs after that. They had such an awesome selection of music playing tonight. I love country music so it's just the perfect place for me. The sweet waitress came shortly after, greeted us and took our orders. The staff members were all nice and friendly. As we were waiting for our orders, other customers walked in and they were greeted in no time at all. The place is spotlessly clean and had a nice warm comfortable atmosphere. Also a really nice bar for beverages, if we wanted an alcoholic beverages. There are lots of TVs around the restaurant as well. We didn't have to wait long for our salads and the waitress even left  the sauce on the side so that our salads won't get all soggy by the time we get home. Greatly appreciate her thoughtfulness. I would totally be back here again to enjoy my dinner with some awesome country music!!!"}
{"text":"A run-of-the-mill neighborhood franchise. Service has been generally very friendly on our handful of visits over the years. As for food & drinks, I'll start with drinks - their Perfect Margarita is better than expected; they offer happy hour $4 apps, $3 draft & margaritas from 3-6pm & 9pm-Midnight. Monday nights they offer $6.99 burgers and fries all evening. These, their signature combos (soup+sandwich, salad+ their double dinners, with a shared appetizer are the best deal-wise.  Foodwise- have tried steaks & salads, for the most part. Hubby & I have had a few steaks and they are good in the flavor department, well seasoned. Although the sirloin isn't the most tender of cuts- they have done a good job preparing them to our preferred doneness (rare & medium rare.) I'm surprised when I get a true rare steak even in the highest-starred restaurants. Ceasar salad, French onion soup and the basic burger are also fine, though the soup is overly salty- I would guess it arrives frozen, not made in-house.  The restaurant feels and looks clean but the ladies restroom needs work- stray towels scattered, unkempt and off-putting.  I get a factory-feeling here. Similar to a place like O.G., I get the sense that their food is packaged in a warehouse somewhere and popped on the stove to warm in-house before serving- not necessarily bad, but I prefer local & fresh.  In sum, I'd say it is a 2.5 star experience, right in the middle- nothing great, nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Not good! Overcooked food, pre made drinks, and underwhelming service. I'll never go back to this location ever again. I gave it 2 tries, once for lunch and once for dinner, both times were subpar. Ribs were dry, broccoli wasn't seasoned, steak was overcooked, cheese dip lacked any kind of flavor, and the pours behind the bar were laughable. Lesson learned, NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Amazing service! My friend and I were sat at a booth right away and our waitress Ashley was there in seconds ready to get us drinks. She was fun, easy to talk to, and very helpful with our food selection. She even understood our weird dislike of bacon lol. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A year ago we went here, and I was really disappointed.  The cooks or management must have since changed.  It is much better and now on par with some of the better Applebee's locations.  The service was very attentive, and our waitress was able to patiently explain how things are served.  She was able to get the chicken to make changes for my guest who had food restrictions.    My tomato basil soup and Southwestern Steak Salad were actually both delicious."}
{"text":"I have given this Applebee's the benefit of the doubt, not 1,2ce, but 3 times and I just have to say something because I've had enough.  We ordered and paid for the food online, thinking it would be much faster and I'd be able to just pick up and go, but it took close to an hour for it to be ready.  This is especially slow service considering the website quoted 20 min.  However, the length of time it took to get our food makes sense considering my steak was bland and well done.  I had asked for my steak to be medium rare, the garlic green beans were over cooked and the sweet potatoes looked like slop.  At best, this reminded me of my high school cafeteria food!  How is it possible that they think it's ok to sell food like this, especially for the price that they sell it for?   I couldn't even justify that the reason it was less than good was because they were busy.  that was not the case.  I would definitely not recommend even my worst enemy to eat there and I'm not one to be so opinionated or share my experiences so openly."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Super slow even though there is barely anyone in the place. People who got seated after us had their orders and  food brought before us and our drinks were very off, who puts a lemon in a corona? Food was just ok. Not worth coming back for"}
{"text":"Waited 25 min after being told 5-10. Then tried to seat us in the bar at a high top but I can't sit in them because I have a leg that doesn't bend. The entire time we waited there was an open booth in the bar area that we were told we couldn't sit at. Then a group that came in after us was offered the booth. But they took a night top, so I asked again about the booth. Still no. Even the manager didn't help. Her response was \"I can't just jump in and tell her how to seat people\" never coming to this applebees again!"}
{"text":"This place has been here forever! Nothing really sticks out.  It's just an okay place to eat.  I always seem to be disappointed, flavor wise whenever I dine here."}
{"text":"My husband and I don't eat at chain restaurants very frequently...we try to avoid them when possible.  Saturday night when trying to decide where to go out for dinner (we are running out of food in our house), I had a list of places I want to try. However, my husband didn't want to spend more than $30 on dinner (no clue why), so all of my ideas were out the window.  We decided on Applebee's since I had a slight craving for a mucho mudslide.  The only highlight of our trip to Applebee's was my mucho mudslide (it was yummy).  My fried chicken salad was large for a half-size and was pretty good.  I'd be concerned if a place could really mess something up as simple as that. My husband got the ultimate trio (basically he got to pick three appetizers)...he ordered the mozzarella sticks (blah...they were barely hot and not as good as they used to be back in the day); the sliders (what is up with every place, not fancy and fancy, having sliders on the menu nowadays??), and chicken wraps (Chris said they were OK).    Our service was worse than the food. It took over 10 minutes after we placed our drink order for our drinks to appear on the table. No clue why it took that long because the bar area wasn't busy and the bartender didn't look backed up.  Second, it took our food forever to come out...we have no clue why.  A mother and daughter walked in after we placed our dinner order and when I glanced over wondering where our food was, I noticed they were eating! They got food before we did!!! GRRRRRRR.  Our bill came to $28, but it was hardly worth it.  On our drive home, we said we should have just gone to Wendy's for dinner...better quality food at a much much cheaper price."}
{"text":"Looking for a true Phoenix experience? Here you go. You show up for happy hour and instead you get cockroaches. The food isn't great. The service isn't bad. The roaches are a wonderful effect of bringing together the \"Phoenix vibe\"."}
{"text":"Our food was cooked perfectly and they were very flexible when I asked to change a few things to my meal. Alycia was our server & she was awesome. Very friendly and personable . She made sure we were always taken care of with whatever we needed . We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on Veteran's day because I'm a Veteran and they offered a free meal to Veterans. We've been here several times along with the one on Hudson Drive in Stow, and the one on Howe Road in Akron. Each time the food is good, and the wait staff is helpful and interested in making your meal a pleasant one. We prefer this Applebees over the other ones due to cleanliness and wait staff. Yes Applebee food is the same from place to place, but with today's prices for a decent meal, Applebees gives a good meal for a decent price. Will we return? DEFINATELY!"}
{"text":"NASTY! The appetizers were cold and we took one bite of out entr√©es and couldn't eat anymore. My chicken was burnt so bad it was black and hard to cut and DRAMATICALLY over seasoned. While my potatoes weren't cooked enough and had ZERO seasoning. We were to nice and didn't speak up about the terrible food but my stomach is still sour as I write this! BARF!"}
{"text":"Last night, Valentine's Day of 2018, my Fianc√© and I went to Apple bees at just before 10pm. We arrived and it was busy, so I was optimistic for a good experience. We got sat at a table and I asked for a booth, they moved us. We ordered our drinks and Hot Buffalo boneless wings for the appetizer. When the plate arrived they were cold. Not room temperature cold but like borderline fridge cold. They quickly replaced the plate with a delicious piping hot one. My Fianc√© ordered a peppercorn rice steak plate, I cannot remember what it was called. I ordered a Triple Bacon burger. Her food was luke warm at the bottom, but hot on top. My burger had 2 slices of bacon and just didn't taste seasoned or anything. I couldn't hardly eat my burger, however I finished my fries. They took it off my order without me requesting, witch was surprising and somewhat redeeming. Overall the waitress was mostly attentive and I felt like I was being payed attention to."}
{"text":"The food is good because newer restaurant. The salad bar is good and at a decent price. The prices are better here,then at the airport. If your waiting around by the airport for someone to come in from where ever. Have eaten at the bar a couple times now and always enjoyed the service and food!!"}
{"text":"Well this place sucks. I ordered stir fry and they brought out mashed potatoes and meat. Sent that back then they sent out a plate of cold stir fry. The vegetables were not cooked, the meat was cold, and the rice was under cooked. My fiancee ordered pasta and the noodles were under cooked. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The waitress deserves 5 stars. She was amazing. Even went as far as to order my sauce on the side for my Mac and cheese with tenders. However the manager is not in the right position. After our food showed up late. Keep in mind it's a salad with shrimp. The manager said the shrimp had to be re-cooked...it's pre cooked..how does that work? Anyway he shows up with the plate after the waiter had to tell the manager to bring it over to us and speak with us. He walks up puts the plate down and stands there..doesn't say anything for about 10 seconds. Than says \"sorry about it being late\" didn't even sound sincere.. Later comes back to ask my mom if she wants a refill. 10 min later the waiter came back with the drink. The manager has no people skills. He seems lost on his own. He does not have the proper training to run a restaurant. Corporate should really re-evaluate the staff."}
{"text":"Went after work late night around 10 pm. Food was okay the customer was awesome. Had a good time had a couple drinks. My kids loved the tablet but the only bad part was we had to pay for them to play on the games. I didn't like that and it only 1 per table. That kinda sucks I have 2 little ones. I would go back without kids and have a drink night with my babe."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the salad I ordered. I got the fiesta chopped chicken salad. It was depressing for $9.99 .... Totally not worth it ... I looked like maybe a $2 salad ... Just thrown together"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch  now the best thing they have here is their two for 20 deal. As for the service it was average not that great not that bad. They did take some time crediting our bill with the coupons we had. That was the disappointing part of the lunch other then that everything was ok."}
{"text":"This place, to put it in simple terms, is a knock-off Chili's and TGI Fridays, but it just tastes worse.  It stays open late, which is a good thing, but the food is just, for lack of better words, meh. I also had those dessert shots (that they stole from Chili's) and the ice cream was old and there were ice chunks in it. Booo...  They have a nice bar, though, I must say. And the atmosphere is okay."}
{"text":"I hadn't visited an Applebee's for a long time. We had a late lunch for appetizers we had the chicken wonton tacos very delicious. Entree the new chicken Parmesan and the fish and chips, very good we ate it all no complains very satisfied. Customer services was great nice experience overall."}
{"text":"I know I said I hate \"chain\" restaurants...but honestly I really do.    We were looking for a reverse happy hour and this was close by so we gave in.  The beer was cold, but our food took FOREVER...literally!  Then, they cooked my steak incorrectly...instead medium rare it came out super over done...I asked for a baked potato and got mashed.  I can say that the bartender (we sat at the bar), noticed immediately and sent it back and had it taken off of our bill.  So the two stars is for the food and for the slow service of the kitchen...I'd give more for the attentiveness of the bartender and the manager!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in last Saturday around 1:30ish and it wasn't super busy, pretty steady. We were on our way to go sit in one of the bar booths and we asked the hostess if we could sit there, she said \"no, I just sat this section and the server is getting drinks right now for other tables!\" She then offered a dirty high top to us, so we sat there. The family that came in right behind us got greeted and sat right at the booth we requested before. Annoying. Then as we sat in the high top for 10 minutes with no service or acknowledgement that we were even there. At least 6 people walked by us without saying a word. One waitress walked by multiple times and didn't give any service. She seemed \"in the weeds\". We were not greeted by the bartender as well who also walked by multiple times. We then decided to leave. It sucks cause I like this place, hopefully it was just a fluke!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food.  The theme for the lunch was dry. The Mac and cheese was...dry.  The chicken was...dry. The wings were...dry.  I don't know if it was leftovers reheated from last night or if they mass cooked the standard dishes in the morning and kept them on the heater."}
{"text":"Showed up at noon on Monday.....14 empty tables... Still had us wait for 15+ min..... Wow this is a training issue.... Servers standing around.... Clearly a management issue..... Will not eat here again.....went to another resturant .. For a quick luncheon meal"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in the Applebee's franchise altogether. About 10 years ago it was like the best place to go for food and drinks. Now it sucks balls! They took away the veggie patch pizza and the grande nachos. Now they only have a select amount of appetizers for half off. What a rip off! I doubt if I'll ever eat at this franchise again, there are better places to go with better food. Even the drink I had was weak, very disappointing"}
{"text":"I came to meet a friend here since I was visiting from California and brought my one month old baby. I had to use the restroom to change baby and when I opened the changing table a bunch of green flakes came flying down and onto the table, which to me looked like marijuana. I told my waitress, she just apologized and said she was going to tell the manager. The manager did not come to our table to apologize and tell us that they were going to take care of it and thank you for letting them know. I have never been to a place where the manager does not take responsibility for something that they are managing!"}
{"text":"Thee absolute most unprofessional restaurant chain I've ever eaten at, ever. Steer clear of this place at all costs, don't waste your money or your time because you will most definitely regret it. Management doesn't care about their employees or their customers, not to mention the food quality has diminished significantly. In a city where customers have a vast variety of food choices you'd think they would be more appreciative of the little business that they do receive, but I guess that's not their on their agenda! If I could give this restaurant in particular a 0 star review I would, but since I can't  I'll just say that 1 star is way too good for what you'll receive if you so choose to eat here."}
{"text":"Applebees is a good, cheaper option compared to other restaurants in the area. The food is decent, regular Applebees fare, but it's not always hot and fresh. Occasionally you will get a good server, but more often than not you'll get someone that is slow or acts like they have no idea what they're doing. However, the management are quick to fix things and friendly."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner last night at this location because my family had previously had a great experience sitting at the bar with SANDY.  But last night overall our experience wasn't the best. Our server GABBY was fine at first. She took our order and brought out the drinks and food with a decent attitude. Checked on our table as she should. Everything was good and then came time for us to check out. My sister and my girlfriend used the little kiosk that are at the table to pay with their debit cards. Let me just say, we never tip on card we always leave cash. We felt as if she did well enough to deserve a tip so we had planned to leave cash. But as she seen there was no tip, she still needed to bring our receipt to be signed. After she RUDELY SLAMMED a *crumbled* receipt on the table she didn't say a word and walked away. The bill got signed and she snatched them off the table and crumbled them in her hand as soon as she took them off the table. So therefore she lost the tip she WAS going to get. Throughout the time we were finishing our drinks she was mumbling things in Spanish as if I couldn't understand her and slamming things mopping around. She's really needs to grow up."}
{"text":"ZACH! YES! Go in and ask for him! 1st time he has been our server. He is so thorough with all of his tables. I'm not rating him on our table alone. I always watch how servers take care of all their tables. 1 impatient person at our table was like where is he. I said \"he's doing his job\". Talking to other ppl around us. It was late and most servers hate late tables, nope, not Zach. I'll make sure we are here more often because of him."}
{"text":"I have not been to Applebee's in over 5 years because the food was terrible. Recently my sister told me that they've changed their menu and I should give Applebee's another try. So we decided to try their online order option with curbside pickup. I ordered 3 cheese CHICKEN penne. Got the food home and there was no chicken. Seriously?! It's in the name of the dish. The food was not great. Seems as tho our memories of Applebee's food holds up. Bleck! No thanks  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Their new beef brisket enchiladas are \"da bomb\"!  High recommend. With a Cadillac Margarita you're in heaven!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to always come to Applebee's but it's just gone down hill, fast. The food is below average at best. If you drink they have good happy hour specials but that's about it. Also, the booth was sat in was disgusting. I took a picture of it because I wanted to show my husband. I think there was one of everything down there including a chicken wing and a birthday candle. Ew!! The waiter was very nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"Oh great, I'm reviewing another chain restaurant and have nothing great to say about anything!  My roommate and I go here because their happy hour specials from 9-close are actually really reasonable and I'm a huge J-E-W so it makes my wallet happy. They have like 5-6 apps under $5 as well as $3 tall draft beers. The bartenders are always friendly and helpful so you can't really complain. The apps are greasy and respectable at best so 3 stars sounds about right."}
{"text":"Great spot for a beer and MAYBE an app, that's about it. Wasn't looking for to much since its Applebee's but decided to give it a whirl & Tried the quesadilla burger. Honestly the worst burger I have ever had, soaked in oil and quality of meat was poor. I am not a critic and hate to bash but I wouldn't wish that plate upon my enemy."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's, if you've eaten here through the years you know how much the food has changed; it's defiantly not like it use to be. I use to love heading to Applebee's for happy hour, but I'm not sure if this location gets that kind of business because the bar always seems to be slow.   I'm a fan of the skinny margarita and honestly it's the only reason I ever want to put it out there for a resturant choice from time to time. The menu is pretty basic to me, nothing that sticks out so much anymore. There are so many other places that surpass what Applebee's is and it's too bad because in the 90's this was the spot.   This location is always inconsistent. Sometimes the food is meh and the waitstaff is also, and there have been times the experience has been good, so it's a hit and miss. I just cant give it more than 2 stars. The food just doesn't taste nearly as fresh and taken care of. It taste overly processed and standard. If this if like your favorite restaurant in the whole world (please venture out) than this experience may be expected or it may be sub par, this location produces, just-that"}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 2 years maybe once a month. But Saturday's service was not up to par. Our waitress never checked on our order. I had to get up and track someone down after waiting 50 min for food that was never even made. Marty the manager came over and fixed the problem right away. Comped our food. I do have to say the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Two starving kids ordered appetizers and kids meals to come out first. 20 minutes later our dinner salads came out. Asked about appetizers and kids meals soon very soon. At 30 minutes cancelled apps. Still no kids meals. Needless to say it all came out together at about 40 minutes. Food is good service horrible."}
{"text":"The food was great but slow service served drinks in the beginng never saw her. after brought-us.   more drinks when lunch was over I'm like really?kim d slow server nice but slow motion is faster then she is!!!!!! Good meal thou belly happy ...... Clean fresh food severed hot and looked great..... ! Ok she going to hate my tip...... Whoops get her some skates......;)"}
{"text":"Great experience with my family. I would definitely recommend this location to others. The service was great they must have a good management team in place and the staff were friendly and efficient. We ordered from the server Amber who was great and off the table side screen that was some of the quickest responses I've ever had. Thanks for a great experience and great food!"}
{"text":"Had this sick waiter at da Greens, he was WHOA! Had me screwed up in the head I mean WHOA! Bought me some boneless hot wings I mean WHOA! Shoulda seen them stains in my undies, like WHOA! Now money ain't a problem, see my dough is like WHOA! Pulled out my bankroll on y'all alphas like WHOA! Floss the abees napkins down there like WHOA! Jamie runnin' business in the house, I'm like WHOA! Had to hit the brakes on y'all car side like WHOA! So I'ma go toe to toe, blow for blow like WHOA! Live the fast life, come'n through the door real slow like WHOA! My peoples like dough, light 'dro, nitro, my flow, nice clothes, abees is like WHOA!"}
{"text":"I like this place on weekends , the food is good so the prices,service needs some improvement."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain very often when it comes to restaurants and service, because I too have worked in the industry and know how tough it can be. My friend and I were in there a week ago, received horrible service, cold food and our appetizer (the spinach dip) was so over cooked, that the entire dip was crusted to the sides of the dish. After making a comment to the manager, we had a slight compensation for the evening. So, I decided last night, to give them one chance at redemption... worst decision! Not only were my boneless chicken wings cold, they tasted as if they were fried in old grease. To top it off, our spinach dip was very runny and also under cooked. The \"perfect margarita\" tasted as if it was made entirely of sweet and sour and the \"Bahama mama\" tasted chalky and gritty. I can handle when service isn't that great, but when I get food poisoning from their lack of QA, that's where I draw the line. Never again will I return to this location!"}
{"text":"Very Salty food husband and u went couse we had a gift card to spend, but the food was meh. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"This place gets a 1 star because the server was nice besides that WOW We ordered the spinach artichoke Dip ( I have had at other applebees) It came out looking like someone dumped a can of Cream spinach in a bowl it didn't even have the cheese on top just green mush. The chips looked like the bottom of the bag and tasted like it to stale and super salty. I ordered the Chicken Penne it came out with mushy over cooked noodles with Alfredo thrown on top the chicken looked like scraps of a leftover plate. All I can say it Yuk. The bread was still frozen in the center. I have had this dish at other Applebees and it never looked or tasted like this one. My Husband got Fish & Chips ( We also have had at other Applebees) This one came out on a plate not a basket. The fish was a dark Brown color like it was fried in old grease and under the fish was a pool of yellow grease. The forgot the Fry's Haha they actual forgot the chip part of Fish & Chips. We called the server over and right away she knew what was wrong and stated she could tell the Fish was way to greasy. The Manager came over and just brushed everything off. I do not believe he tried to fix the situation. We did not want replacement food so we tipped the waitress because it's not her fault the Kitchen sucks and we left never to return. Applebees Surprise is off the list. Worst Applebees we have ever been to. You are better off with Burger King."}
{"text":"Visiting from California with my girlfriend and we decided to stop in here while we were waiting for our friend to get off work. Our server was Karl and he was extremely polite, personable and attentive to our needs if ever needed anything. He checked in often enough to be present and he always seemed super genuine when he did check in. The flavored iced tea was great, and it was cool to hear that he made it himself. I'd recommend that you ask and see if you can get Karl as your server, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Applebee's is one of those places that has gotten better over the years. They actually reduced the portion sizes a bit and improved the taste of their food. I wasn't overly in love with the fish and chips I ordered, but it wasn't bad. Just tasted a bit off from what I expected. The fries were good, and the portion sizes were much more reasonable than I remember. Hubby liked his meal as well, and the blondie for dessert is always our favorite. They're back to bringing them out piping hot instead of lukewarm like they did for a few years. Service was fast and friendly. As always though, if you want a quiet restaurant where you can chat, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, service and customer care. Many thanks to the kitchen for preparing our delicious food; to Janielle for her awesome service - perfect combination of professional and personal (just a genuinely kind person); and to Ken for making our celebration extra special by acknowledging our kids' piano recitals with free meals for them today and coupons for another free meal each!"}
{"text":"My entire family and I have been going to this location for 3 years on a weekly basis \"sometimes twice a week.\"  Most the night staff know us when we walk in the door.  We have shared many laughs and great times with the Applebee's evening staff but let me say the day management is so unprofessional and the service was so bad that I literally wouldn't feel comfortable ever going to this location again.  Go anywhere else but this location."}
{"text":"The food was not that hot. It was good. But it was definitely sitting a minute. That ribs are really good!"}
{"text":"This is a zero rating. Worst place to eat. Let's start from the beginning. When walking in took a while to be greeted even though multiple employees were standing chatting by the door. When it came to ordering, I wanted a tea with a lemon slice but I got something different. Eventually they addressed the mistake and it took two people and three times asking for my lemon. When we received our food it was cold and salty and under cooked. When I asked for my side to be heated a little it came back as hot as lava is there no happy medium. Lastly one employee busted our table but already had a full hand and proceeded to drop silverware and food everywhere, so unprofessional. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"This review is for you if you often find yourself looking for decently priced sit-down style dining in the late evening...  Believe me I know: After 10pm there is not much for sit-down selection, and everyone knows the service almost always is terrible and sometimes the food too...when you walk into a restaurant after 9 when it closes at 10....  I admit I walked in to here after delaying my eating to the point where selection was slim(9:15ish)... I wanted Japanese but unfortunately the hipsters and millennials had taken over all of the Japanese restaurants to eat their cold, raw, \"delicious\", sushi .. I walked into a Japanese restaurant that had a revolving sushi bar, a list where you write your own name down, twenty people STANDING at the entrance, and went ungreeted - it appeared that's the way the business was meant to be until you sit down and get service. .. I went to put my name on the list and immediately changed my mind..  HECK, that list made me feel like a loser because EVERYONE on it had more than one person, and here I am, this restaurant wants me to proclaim to everyone who views the waiting list that I am the only loner in the room!   So I went to Applebee's down the street.   On a Friday night they had domestic pints for $2.29 - wow!   They close at 1 so I felt in no hurry. At 10:00 the entire restaurant was busy and provided a great vibe.  Food deal was amazing for the price.   Applebee's should be a go to for so many."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try their all day brunch burger. It did not disappoint!  The burger was well seasoned and just the right amount of pink. The roll was toasted. The egg on top of hash browns was done perfectly. As soon as I cut the burger in half, the yolk spilled over. It was awesome!  The onion rings were very crispy. The service was on point. They have really stepped up their game!"}
{"text":"Spoiler alert...this place sucks.  This was the worst, slowest service of all time. Our server was pleasantly rehearsed and unconcerned when our food took almost an hour to come out. How long can it take to microwave some chicken?   I have to say I gave it 2 stars over only one because the healthy grilled options were actually healthy and were quite good. I got grilled chicken with broccoli and fire roasted veggies for $11, and my hubby had same but double broccoli for $10."}
{"text":"Went to This Applebee's the 1 st time, since all the others seam to get worse with every visit.  We ordered our favorite app the brewpub pretzels. And my husband and I had the 2 for $25 we ordered salads with our meals and to my surprise, the salad here was a really good quality. I had no bad leaves in it that I had to pick out.  I ordered my steak medium/well, it was more well and my hubby ordered medium what was more well, too! But all in all our food was tasting pretty good.  I was freezing like crazy at this place, I had to ask twice to turn down the AC, that bothered me a little. It was blowing right on us."}
{"text":"Lunch was good.  However my first table had ants crawling (by the window)  We were quickly reseated.  Applebees is good for a quick meal.  I had the shrimp thai salad.  Our server was attentive and kept our glasses filled.  Valerie had a burger that was perfectly cooked as well.  All in all I do like Applebees."}
{"text":"It was past lunch time & we had 35 min. to eat. I remember when Applebee's had 12 minute lunch options so my husband & I headed over for a quick bite to eat.  We were seated behind a mgr. interviewing a waitress which was a first for me. It was a bit strange because I thought maybe that should be done somewhere private or at least NOT directly behind a booth of customers so who can overhear the questions & answers.  We ordered & received our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. HOWEVER, we ordered a chocolate lava dessert (for me) & an all you can eat soup & salad (for my husband) and after TWENTY MINUTES we did not get any food!!! I ended up having to cancel my dessert order & leave to pick up our children from school & drive BACK to the restaurant to get my husband since he chose to go ahead & wait for the food because he really likes the tomato basil, french onion & chicken tortilla soup (he also likes it at Chili's) and the oriental chicken salad as well as the fiesta chicken salad.  While I was gone he moved to a table in the bar area to see the \"game\" on TV & told me the bartender was friendly. However, I don't plan on going back here for a LOOONG time. Especially since today we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery on Superstition Springs & Power where they have all you can eat soup & salad for only $7.95 as opposed to the $9.99 price at Applebee's.  Thinking back I do remember having a problem at this location about 5 yrs. ago when we went for a family dinner with my parents & they sent us a gift card in the mail because of the problems we had then. I guess they haven't improved much in those years. :/"}
{"text":"I seriously tried to make this place work.  I placed another to-go order and the entire thing was ridiculous - completely wrong. The hostess was so rude it was obnoxious, the manager was rude, instead of replacing my food they charged me twice for it. So much happened Applebee's isnt even worth me wasting my time writing them a bad review - I WILL NEVER GO TO ANOTHER APPLEBEES IN MY LIFE - TRUST ME STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and 5min later walked right out. Not one server acknowledged us and multiple ones made eye contact. After a while we walked up to the bar to ask if it was open seating she said no and someone would be out to help.... no one came to seat us it was during the day time there were plenty of open seats. Worst experience ever. Talked to the manager who was pleasant however my family and I were over the experience there and ate at a nearby restaurant."}
{"text":"Our server was somewhat a dumb ass and not very good.  Drinks sat empty appetizer was never delivered. I probably won't go back to that AB when we are in the area..."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this Applebee's, and I've been going there for years.  terrific service almost every time -- sometimes I've even called the manager over to COMPLIMENT the server.    The decor is kinda casual laidback sports bar.  It's a neighborhood chain folks:  Don't go there expecting the it to be like the Ritz or the Biltmore.  A steak dinner here only costs $10-$12 bucks.  And for that price, it's surprisingly good!!!  I want my steak medium-rare (on the rare side), and that's how they serve 'em to me.  On the rare occasion that I'm dissatisfied, I ask 'em to \"repair the damage\" and they do it immediately - and with an apology and a friendly smile.  The first time I at here I really liked it, and I told my 'rents.   They wouldn't even try it.  Took me weeks to convince them to walk in the door.  Then, they decided to eat at this Applebee's 3 - 5 nights a week!  And, sometimes they did eat at the Ritz, so they knew the diff.  As far as I'm concerned, for a neighborhood chain restaurant, Applebee's is just fine, thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Be sure to sit at the bar and enjoy an Apple Sangria!  Hand made to order and delish!!!"}
{"text":"A truly classic menu, well proportioned meal, at just the the right pricing.    We enjoy sitting at bar, there is usually a sporting match on.   Staff are friendly and check on you frequently.   Downfall:  There is a small gadget on the table in which you can order & pay for meal  without having any human interaction.  I am not a fan.  If I wanted isolation and a lack luster encounter I would stay home."}
{"text":"Not the best for how much it is. Kinda looks like the food had been sitting out for a while before serving it. Not very fresh or tasty and portions are small. Service is great but won't go again."}
{"text":"My wife and i eat here a lot since it is in our neighborhood.  Today we met up with me parents who are in town.    My parents had the two for $20 special.  I went with a new entree that had roasted , smashed baby red potatoes,  artichoke hearts, peppers and onions over a sirloin steak with a balsamic glaze.  My entree was excellent.  I will definitely try this one again.  The Shocktop on draft was very cold and excellent.  Service was on the spot.  All our needs were taken care of and our waiter stopped by periodically to make sure we were doing well.  The place was very busy which is something we don't see all the time.  Overall another good visit to this location.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for the type of food served, I ordered Sirloin and it was a dry peace of meat not worth the money we spent for the night Caesar salad came out with hardly and dressing and little lettuce on the plate. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"I visited this Applebees location with my friends not too long ago. I am 9 months pregnant and the restaurant was busy so the only parking spots were curbside to go or all the way in the back outside of their designated parking area by Burlington or McDonalds. I have a difficult time walking 9 months pregnant as it is because I waddle, my hips hurt and I have pressure on my pelvis, but it was also icy, and slippery being January and it was dark out.... so I parked in one of the 3 available curbside to go parking spots. When I got in the restaurant, the hostess told me that I couldn't park there because it was for curbside to go customers only. I kindly explained to her that there was no other parking and I was 9 months pregnant making it hard to walk from a further spot.  She started explaining to me that someone could have dropped me off at the door and parked somewhere else, to which I replied that I drove myself and was meeting friends. She then started talking to another associate telling her that I couldn't walk because I was pregnant, almost making me sound lazy. So I got upset with her and told her how ridiculous she was being because nobody was parked in curbside to go. The manager came over because she saw I was upset and she agreed to seat me but asked me if I could move my car if another spot became available. When another spot became available she came and got me, and my friend kindly moved my car for me. The manager gave me a free appetizer for my trouble, which I thought was nice. Although the manager handled things much better than the hostess, I am still baffled and upset at how they worry more about their curbside to go customers who stay for 2 minutes and then leave than a 9 month pregnant customer who wants to come in and eat and tip a waitress.... I get the importance of the spots for curbside but I wish they would have made an exception for me this time given the circumstances and that there weren't any curbside parkers at the time. Aside from the parking situation, we did have a friendly waitress and my food tasted very good."}
{"text":"I think if you mentally lower your expectations then the food is decent for the price. We did the carside to go thing for the first time. It went smoothly and the service was good which is why I have the 3 stars. Food was packaged nicely and it was ok warm by the time we got to our destination.  Like I said, food was ok but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"If I could give a 1/2 of a star I would. The service is TERRIBLE! We were first sat where it was freezing and the waiter was very unprofessional & made it uncomfortable with stupid little remarks. We then moved to the bar area because that the only place you can get the happy hour appetizers, which isn't unheard of but would have been nice if the waiter promoted what they have. After ordering our main course (I got shrimp) and as the food came out they told me they were out of cocktail sauce. I then waited 30 minutes for extra lemon (which I never got because no one checked on us after the first time again). This was by far the WORST experience I've ever had anywhere. Never again. Save your money."}
{"text":"The veggies were so good I could have made a meal out of just them. But the 9 ounce sirloin was delicious. And the mashed potatoes mmmmm."}
{"text":"It's the chain Bar hang out. Not thrilling yet fun.  Good food and drinks. Wait staff is fun and good workers.  Prices are in line."}
{"text":"If you are looking to dine at Applebee's, do not dine at this location. Service was slow, employees talking bad about each other around customers, the server even dropped a plate on my friend. Asked for ranch , never got it, other people were served before my party was and they came in after us. We were waiting for our appetizers for almost an hour. Our orders were wrong. We even complained to the manger Manny Avila and he acted like he didn't care. He didn't even apologize for the mistakes that were made nor did he come back to check on us. After paying for the horrible service, we had to wait 25 minutes JUST to get our cards back."}
{"text":"First time going there and the customer service is so poor, the food was cold, and they took forever to bring out the food. I'm not ever going back I rather go somewhere else and spend my money ! I'm not going to leave tips to horrible service and horrible food ! The girls that work there look so miserable ! They aren't nice and don't check to see how you're doing. Worse of all the food tasted cold and the wait time was super long and didn't seem as busy. Look for a better Applebee's because this one was horrible ! My experience wasn't good and hopefully is better for someone else but I'm for sure not coming back to horrible service ! Not even the food was good so there was nothing pleasing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible all around. Was seated with no silverware. When we asked for silverware it seemed like a hassle for the wait staff to get us silverware. We were brought 4 forks(no knives)and that is after receiving our entree. Half the food was cold. Salad that was ordered for appetizer came out after the entree and was not even correct. The place was half full so it's not like they were slammed busy. Would not recommend this place even if you had a gift card."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate Applebee's. It's always one of my girlfriends who drags me into this establishment. Usually on the pretenses that they're paying, because if I were paying there's a lot of other places I would rather be.   Let's start with what they do good. The service is usually pretty good the people that work there are very nice, you never usually have to wait for a table. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. Whenever you have a complaint staff usually address it with no hassles and a smile.   The order was the spinach dip with the fiesta chicken and a bourbon steak  The spinach dip was Ok the chips were coated in salt, so much that I found it to be not edible.  The fiesta chicken tasted like a nacho supreme from Taco Bell with chicken  The Bourbon steak it was good I mean you can't really screw up steak but it came with the wrong side order.   I'm still trying to figure out what people like about this place."}
{"text":"Man where do I start!!! Not only did the host forget about us, we did not get noticed  till my son called on the bus boy to get us a waitress!! Finally got our food but all our drinks were empty and no silver ware or napkins!! It just seems like these poor staff have NO Formal training."}
{"text":"The food used to be better, and why cant you serve fajitas anymore? The service is usually pretty good, just wish there was more choice on the menu and the beer wasnt so darn expensive"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and recieved ok service. Drinks were slow service was slow until today. Server Nic was absoulutly an amazing server.  Applebee's management needs to take note. This guy is amazing. I love getting awesome service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Got here from the Lightrail and it was a much needed lunch break. My wife got the steak and shrimp and I got pretzels and beer, both were super delicious. Our waitress was nice and even made a custom fruit drink for my significant other. We both left full and happy"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice and both times were horrible.  Slow servers and they act as if it's an inconvenience to serve you. Food both times have been luke warm."}
{"text":"This Applebee's is way better than the location in Champaign I've been here several times and the staff has always been really friendly also the recently to a wood fire grill and it has made a big difference in the quality of food"}
{"text":"Went into this store because they unexpectedly closed my usual Applebee's on Chandler Blvd. I was seated quickly in the bar area as requested. The poor schmuck behind the bar was tasked with covering/serving the entire bar area including all the hi-tops and booths AND mix drinks.  I ordered and was served a drink relatively quickly given the short staffing. Upon ordering a refill I placed an order for the fish and chips. My food was served within 10 - 15 minutes. The first bite was good but the closer I got to the middle of the piece of fish the colder the food became until it was just plain cold. After informing the bar tender/waiter and sending the plate back, the manager on duty stepped up and apologized for the under-cooked food. About 10 minutes later another order was delivered to my table. This time it was HOT and cooked through. The point of this review is not to condemn the entire restaurant for the mistake of one cook. The manager's apology was appropriate but an offer to comp the dinner would have been more appropriate and appreciated. Things could have been worse - under-cooked fish - just sayin'."}
{"text":"It's an okay place. Have been to better Applebee's. Also, was a little bit upset because my friend couldn't purchase a drink because her ID was not horizontal, although she is 21. Anyways, this was just an okay experience."}
{"text":"Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff and the French onion soup was pretty good, the sriracha shrimp I won't order again...we'll be back....my fianc√©e did enjoy his burger :)"}
{"text":"Local hangout great Margarita and salads, nice bartenders. Go to the bar and meet a neighbor..."}
{"text":"Applebee's is a pretty safe bet for a decent meal, and this one is no exception.   Nothing about the food stands out to me. I usually go with a steak and potato kind of meal here, and there'snot too much you can screw up there. They even get the temperature of the streak right just about every time. Full bar, of course, though the specialty drinks I think are a little to expensive with too little booze. (It's a chain, what can ya' do?) But the beer is priced just right, and that's good enough for me.   The service is what rubs me the wrong way here. I've witnessed the staff being inappropriate. (dirty jokes, flirty comments, etc) It wasn't the worst thing ever, but it's consistent enough that I usually give a second thought to going here.  Karaoke on Monday nights is a fun diversion from the norm as well!"}
{"text":"Toooooooo freaking bright ,  i am gettin lightbulb burn.   Servers sitting at the bar with their uniform.  The bartender took 8!minites to acknowled me.   Toooooooo bright! Not likelly to return :-(."}
{"text":"This Applebee's suffers from slow service. Our server was a big dude. When he finally brought our meals, I felt like he was throwing the food at me. I ordered tomato basil soup. It tasted good but was served at room temperature. I also ordered chicken quesadilla. It was good, but the salsa was muy caliente. My dining partner ordered French Onion soup. It was hot and tasted great. She also ordered a garden salad. It was colorful and fresh."}
{"text":"Soooo we decided to return tonight and our server was Christian and he was just as Awesome as Billy! We actually saw Billy and he stopped by to chat. I must say that this location is a must on our next trip out here. Have to admit that this location can train the locations in Cali, keep up the great work! See you next time"}
{"text":"So I sat in the bar and watched the bar tender tell a guest that he was overwhelmed right now and couldn't take someone's order.  4 people at the bar and 2 tables with people. Finally the guest asked for the manager and the bartender said I will be right with her after I finish I am really busy   Maybe a new bartender is needed. Guest placed her order after 15 min wait...."}
{"text":"The food is good but boy management needs to get their act together at this place I went to this restaurant and there were many seats available however because their computers not working they couldn't sit anybody that's ridiculous the manager didn't seem to understand old-school basic customer service all they needed to do was sit somebody down and once the computers back up enter the table into the system."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner on 9/18/13. Usual service was good for the establishment. We tried the new additions to the menu. I had the Honey Pepper steak and the wife had the Honey Chicken Shrimp. The honey really overpowered the dish. The steak was cooked how I ordered. I tried the wife's shrimp and thought I was eating candy. This dish will never be ordered again. The onions and jalape√±os were smothered in the honey syrup. It should have been fried and placed on the steak after it was cooked. That's how it looked on the menu. On a scale of 1-10 I rate this dinner a 2. This Applebee's is In my neighborhood and we will keep going but will not be trying any new dishes especially if honey is added."}
{"text":"Let's just sum it up quickly. Wait was terrible on a late Thursday night. Finally seated, 15 mins before they took our order. Food came out, cold and or overcooked. Only good thing was our waiter, he was doing his best. Will not be returning with all the late night choices down Central."}
{"text":"Well it was my 1st Applebee's in Canada ... I've been to many U.S locations but never one here in the GTA .  It was pretty much the same in atmosphere and food . Quality was good as was the food . I wish it was the same prices as in the U.S but what can you do .... Our server was nice and courtious...took great care of our group . Drink specials are decent as is cocktail selection . All in all 2 thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Food was very good, tasted fresh! service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"OK Chain restaurant.  I went here with a gift card that I received for my birthday.  Not somewhere I would ever choose to go!  The best thing i can say about the restaurant is that we had a great waitress.  The manager was berating the hostess in front of all the customers.  It was ridiculous!  The manager felt that she was superior to al the staff b/c she had some title.  it was a bit ridiculous.  The other staff seem tog et along with each other very well.    The restaurant was not crowded by any means.  Not my restaurant of choice.  if you want quick, OK, food, with good service, then go here or stop somewhere else on McKnight road!"}
{"text":"The table they set us at was sticky, our server didn't take out drink order for a good 5-10 minutes ten proceed to take multiple customer's orders who arrived after us orders for food before we even got our drinks. Will likely not return to this location because of the waitress."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend on a Tuesday night. They were NOT busy, I know how being busy is considered, i work at a restaurant. We had horrible service. We waited 10 minutes at the front, while servers looked at us and walked past us. When the person came up to us to seat us, we didn't even know we were being sat because he just took menus to a table without saying anything to us. We figured it out when we saw him glaring at us for not following him. When we were sat, it was another 10 minutes before we were greeted. My friend and I both ordered water, which took another 10 minutes. When the water came, there was literally things floating around in it. It was disgusting. Our food also took forever and came out cold. I had the 4 cheese Mac and cheese and there was not any sauce on my noodles. When I asked for a side of it, she told me she would have to change me $3. I told her there is literally no cheese for my pasta why would I be charged? She gave me a nasty look and said she wouldn't change me. She didn't check up on us once during our meal and we had to ask someone to get our check. When she came to get our money, she brought up they were short staffed. I really don't understand how they were because I saw 3 managers walking around with 10 waitresses (I counted) with no more than 10 tables. At my work, we are lucky if we have 3 waitresses working at a time. She also charged me $4 for the cheese sauce, after she told me it would be $3 and that she wouldn't change me. She tried to argue with me about how she never told either of those things, then manger came over and took it off for me."}
{"text":"Scary experience!a request for a simple pasta with no meat(am veg) lands me with a pasta with chicken pieces in it!how to trust what you put in your dishes when you cant follow simple instructions of customers.. No more eating at this outlet any more."}
{"text":"been to this pace a few times, each time the food wasn't as good as other Applebee's I've been to. service was lacking and I'm just not enthused about going back. plenty of other options around."}
{"text":"The place needs a facelift, badly. It felt grungy; there was a stain of some kind on one of the seats at our table and the table was sticky. Our daughter's \"cheese pizza\" was on a tortilla and the cheese was not melted all the way along with WAY too much sauce. Either the waitress or the chef got my order wrong (a totally different dish than I ordered) so while my family ate I had to wait for my food to be remade. Only good part about our experience was that we had a gift card so we only paid $13 after tip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"go to's\" when I want something light and fast without being labeled as fast food. I usually try to get there around happy hour because the beer and appetizers are half off. The wonton chicken tacos are my favorite. They were a lil greasy this time which I was totally surprised. I always ask for limes on the side to make them a little more tasteful. The spinach artichoke dip is something I order as well. My friend doesn't eat meat ordered the artichoke chicken pasta without the chicken but complained that it was cold when he received it. For some odd reason the service wasn't as good as I normally receive. Maybe because it was kind of late. We went there after 9pm. We had to wait to be seated because no hostess was around to seat us, although we were the only ones there waiting. I eventually flagged someone down and asked if we were to seat ourselves. He said no and went to find someone. I would definitely give Applebee's another go round because it's close to my house and I usually like the service and the food. Oh I got the ribs and fries to go because I was already full from the appetizers. They were delicious! I had them for lunch the next day at work."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience from beginning g to end. We waited forever for a waitress when there were only three other tables filled. Then we discussed the menu and chose a 2 for $20 plus one free appetizer order. My husband wanted wings first then he ordered the fiesta chicken and I ordered the classic burger with bacon, cheese & pickles.  It took over 30 minutes for her to bring out not our wings, BUT our main courses!  I asked where the wings were and she said we didn't order them!  Took back entrees and 25 more min went by before the wings appeared. Finally she brought out the orders. I didn't have bacon or pickles nor the mayo I specifically ordered. Took 5 more min for these to come. When the bill came, we were charged wrong!!!! Not the 2/20, but by individual prices. She had to redo the bill.  Never go to Applebes on E Ray Road!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, I just went in to get a quick gift card.  It was an easy process, we were greeted, I told her what I wanted, she asked how much!  Boom, Bam, Done! And off to the party! I don't think I ever ate here, I hope it's decent!  lol"}
{"text":"Applebee's is always consistent. I ordered the salmon with spinach and mashed potatoes. My salmon was cooked to my liking and everything else was delicious! I ordered a perfect margarita and it was just that! Perfect! Unfortunately, I don't remember my server's name but she was a sweetheart. We were catching a 6:10 p.m. movie showing so I'd say, I was dining here between 3:45 to about 5:15 p.m. just this Saturday past. I appreciated her attentiveness and how she took special care to get our order, \"just right!\" Kudos to her! She was a gem and I mentioned that in my personal customer satisfaction survey that she asked me to participate in, after dinner. She is the perfect example of how to deliver great customer service from beginning to end! Hadn't been to Applebee's in awhile but if I had to do it again soon, it will be to this exact location and I'd ask to be sat on her side, which was to the right of the bar, as you're escorted in. Thank you to her and the hiring manager for hiring a great lady and helping us solidify our return. Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"This was single handedly the worst food I have ever had to pay for. I have had fresher, better tasting foods at fast food joints. Why 2 stars? Only because service was mediocre and no where near as nauseating as the food.  I ordered the salmon, the only thing that sounded anyhow attractive. Salmon came on a bed of spinach that looked like it was microwaved in the folds of a morbidly obese guy. No, wait, that might actually taste better than what it was. I am not exaggerating when I say that the nasty rubbery taste of that spinach stayed in my mouth for 2 days. My husband's steak was on a bed of the same disgusting spinach. I don't know if they keep buckets of that crap in the back, but seems like it oozes out of every dish they bring out. The salmon was dry a dry plank of fish that could not possibly been prepared only once. If I didn't know any better I would say it was stale to begin with and microwaved twice over the course of a week, the grill marks were drawn on with a brown sharpie and then set gently in front of me for food.   Applebees, I gave up all hope. I used to love your food, it used to be good, but after a factory packaged, cold chocolate cake you gave me to go a year ago, paired with the above mentioned recent fiasco, I have to break up with you. Publicly. FOREVER."}
{"text":"Why is this place busy?  Burger and salmon were both over cooked; third entre presentation was blah. Service was slow but friendly. Used up a $50 gift card on 3 meals and one dessert so no need to go back!"}
{"text":"I've had a few experiences here and I don't think any of them were good.  Seems like maybe once a year we go, have a bad experience, then remember \"oh yeah, that's why we don't ever come here.\"  First off, a couple of years ago my wife and I went here we had an issue with undercooked food & bad service.  We were later given a survey and the manager ended up contacting us and giving us a gift card for the next time we were in.    A year later we ended up using the gift card in part to get some burgers to go. We ordered online, specified exactly what we wanted on the burgers, and my wife picked it up.  Apparently \"plain with meat, cheese, and bun\" means slather some thousand island on the burgers, because that's what they did.  Unfortunately my wife didn't notice this until she got back home and had to go back to get the corrected order.  Just the other night we went again and ordered an appetizer and a couple of entrees.  The entrees were different and the sides were different.  They put the wrong sides with the wrong entrees.  My wife eats broccoli and I do not.  To me the smell of it makes me want to vomit.  The manager is the one who brought out our food and I pointed out to him that the wrong sides were on the wrong plate and that broccoli weirds me out.  He said he could take the plate back and get the right side on there and \"it would only take a minute.\"  Basically he indicated that to correct the problem he was going to scrape the broccoli off and put the right side on.    No, I do not want the rest of my food covered in broccoli juice.  My wife and I just ended up swapping entrees.    There's a reason this place only has 2.5 stars.  I think we have been here 3 times in 3 years and every time it's either bad service, bad food, or both."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars.  Not the best Applebees I've been to but not the worst either.  They seem to have some strange policies in place.  If you order car side to go after 8:00 they make you go into the restaurant.  They also won't seat until your entire party is there even if your entire party is two people and the restaurant is fairly empty.    The servers were fairly unprofessional.  At one point our server shouted over our table to the bar tender about something.  I suppose that sort of thing happens when the oldest employee that evening appered to be under 30 years old.  Not that people who are young can't be professional, but this crew certainly was not.  Service was also fairly slow.  Often I had to ask more then once for either more water or a side of sauce.    Food is typical of any Applebees.  As long as you go expecting chain restaurant food, you won't be disappointed.  The best deals are to go after 9 and get half off of a nice selection of appetizers."}
{"text":"Worst Applebee's experience I've had.  We were seated and then waited 10 minutes to even be greeted.  And then it was only because we flagged someone down.  No apologies when we were finally taken care of.  I needed to ask for water three times before I finally went up to the bar to ask for some.  It was then that our server came over with water.  We ordered soup and entrees.  He delivered one soup and an appetizer claiming that was what we ordered and there was no way he misheard.  About five minutes later a manager came over and said something to the lines of \"I understand that you've had some issues\"  I then proceeded to very calmly explain what our issues had been.  You could tell he wasn't very interested in what we had to say and didn't seem to care that his server had issues.  His lack of caring was apparent in the fact that while we were waiting to be greeted and during one of the many asks for water, there were several servers and the manager standing behind the bar shooting the breeze.  The food (once the order was right) was good, but the wait and the mistakes make it highly unlikely we will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Our go to place for a quick dinner before movies. Love the burgers. Our little one loves the mac and cheese. All in all, great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Swore off ever coming here again a year ago now I remember why... Bad service slow service and mediocre food. Boring and too pricey for quality. Damn commercials do a good job making this crud look good."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for one of their servers, Jayme. My friend and I were in town Saturday night from Chicago for the Brat fest, and we decided to stop here before heading back home. From the onset you can tell he is very courteous and attentive, as any server should be. At first glance it appears as though he's the only one working the entire restaurant because he's so busy attending to everyone's needs, including at the host desk. However, Jayme was having a difficult night due to unruly and disrespectful customers who were demanding his time unnecessarily. My friend and I observed him treating everyone with the same level of kindness, respect, and attention - certain tables were the problem, not him. To the management - please give him a round of applause cause he's amazing and clearly a harder worker than the other servers (that evening). To Jayme - you're so great, don't let a handful of idiots stop you from being a good person!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. I got the fish and chips. The fish came out hot but it was a tad too salty. French fries were mediocre but very good cole slaw. My friend got the shrimp stir fry which she had to send back because it tasted like a salt lick. The manager spoke to her to see if he could get her something else.  She decided on the quesadilla burger in which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"One step above 1star because the occasional car side employee is nice. I've been to this location since I was a high school student in the 90s and it has been a continuous downhill experience since. Food quality is terrible and I'm no conesuir or foodie by any means. I have two unused gift cards in my wallet that I can't bare to use and I'm under a mile away from this location."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  This location as always busy. Ive been holding off on the review. Each time we go i feel that they just dont have it together. Maybe its just a poor manager.   Food has always been great. The last time we went our server was awesome. 1 out of 3 visits..it should always be awesome or at least good.  On a side note: you bartender gets a 1 star for pouring beer into hot mugs. Had to get the beer replaced a few sips in because it had already got warmish.  Still not sure if we will be back. So many great spots to go in this area.  That going somewhere that is not giving it 100% seems like just a bad idea. Even if Applebee's is somewhat a good deal price wise"}
{"text":"Another example of \"I'm a chain restaurant and I don't care about my next paycheck.\" My issues with our experience are quite simple but cemented the fact that we will never return. One, my wife's steak was requested well done. Came to our table at best, medium. Her steak came with a healthy dose of gristle and fat. When asked to have a replacement, to my wife's objection, the waitress just left. Two, only when the check was brought to our table did we get offered ONE dessert to share complements of the manager. I have a few issues with this. Why did our server wait til the check to inform us of this. Why did the manager not address us personally. Lastly, if the best you could do was a free, mass produced dessert, well shame on Applebee's. Here's the best part, the only reason we were there was because of a gift card Christmas present. We left and went to Bar None in Aliquippa and had better food, better service and better prices."}
{"text":"I was feeling great before I went to Applebee's. Later that night in my hotel, I was up all night in the bathroom.  It makes me feel nauseous just thinking about food at Applebee's now. I hope it was just a fluke and my appetite returns. The staff was friendly and professional.  The food did taste good. I think it was a giant portobello mushroom with spinach.  I guess I will never know."}
{"text":"GROSS!  It had been years since I've been here, so I took my kids recently.  The music from the bar area was so loud, I could not hear my thoughts!  We had to wait a few minutes too long for an waitress introduction and drink order. While we waited for our server to appear, we had plenty of time to decide what to order and did so at the same time we ordered drinks. The food was cheap and low-quality.  My daughters mac and cheese looked like something frozen and reheated from home.  Her side fruit actually came in a store-bought container.  The food just yucky-the service and atmosphere even worse!"}
{"text":"I absolutely detest the chain restaurants but since this location is close to my house I've been talked into coming here a few times. Honestly, their food isn't bad and I usually have pretty good service so that's why I'm begrudgingly giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"There Really needs to be no stars. !!!!  They just wasted an hour and a half of my life that I can't get back .  Then when I never got my food I was told the manager was taking care of my dinner and I could leave .  I would've had to of gotten a dinner first .!  I sat for over 20 minutes at the bar before she even acknowledged me . what a complete waste of time and I still haven't eaten"}
{"text":"Had an early lunch here this afternoon with the in-laws as they live close, and like this place. We must have gotten there right when they opened as there about 3 groups of people waiting to be seated. With one waiter and the bartender trying to handle seating everyone.  We ended up being sat by the bartender in his section and that worked out well. He was really great, actually had personality (which is rare to see in chain restaurants) , and got everything right on the money. Wife and I ended up with 2 for $20 which includes an app and 2 entr√©es.  Everything else was pretty ok.  Nothing disastrous, but nothing great except our service."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 9 (one of them our 2 yr old) here and it was a Friday night so we understood a wait was going to happen so we gave our name and went to wait, they told us a 40 min. wait time, well 30 min. in we heard them call my friends name, went inside and they said no sorry they didn't have enough seats for 9 only 6 so never mind, went outside to wait again and after another 15 minutes my friend went in to ask if our table was ready yet, they said it would have to be another 40 minutes because when they had called our name the first time they crossed our group off!!! Needless to say we told them they were the dumbest lousy people in the world and left to eat at Zipp's on Bethany Home near 15th street, we had a great time and great food there instead!"}
{"text":"Pretty good performance by the Applebee's in Robinson a few days ago. We ordered our food after 10pm, so our appetizer was half-off. We had the boneless BBQ wings, a must-have! My friend ordered the honey chicken macaroni, and he thought it was marvelous. I had the stout sirloin with gravy, and I ordered it rare, but it came out medium. That's the only reason I gave this restaurant a 4/5. If I'm in the area, I'd come back. The server was attentive, the atmosphere was good, and the food was hot."}
{"text":"1.  Went online to order.   The options for selecting ceasar salad make u either select no dressing or other dressing before u can submit the order.   So I had to call in the order.  STRIKE 1.  2.  Went to curbside pick up. Waited 15 min. And no one came out.  Watched thru the window as she... MARIELA IS HER NAME, talked to another employee.   Then took a phone call.  So I called from my cell and said HELLO... can someone come out... OOOOOK, then someone walks in and she takes his order... still waiting... finally the bartender comes out... Oh boy, I ask for a manager, because by now I am mad, neglected, and certian food will be cold.  So I wait another hmmm 7+ minutes.  Lady comes out, I ask r u the manager?  She nicely replies sorta.  Sorta? Yes, she says I'm in training.   I express my frustrating story... so sorry,  I will have the manager call u.  Hmmm but I am here now?  STRIKE 2.   3.  I get home 4 min 1.5 mile drive,  AND there is a message from the night manager.  WTF?  SO I call, get the same take out girl, put on hold,  4 minutes, then disconnected.   STRIKE 3.  4.  I call back.  Get Juan the P.M. manager he says.  My fries are not hot,  worse not even warm... worse actually cold, and raw.  Burger missing the bacon, pickles, onions, ( read online description 2 for $20 burger option... the bun so hard, incredibly hard burger way overcooked and dry.   NO EXHAGGERATION ~ ALL FACTS!   I ask for a credit, take it off my card please. I'd even return the food, it's not eatable.     Sorry can't do that.  STRIKE 4 = YELP REVIEW.    SHAME ON ME FOR NOT READING THE OTHER REVIEWS OF THIS STORE FIRST!  Hope u the reader will take this warning."}
{"text":"Their menu changed for the worst. Had salmon w artichokes and the portion was small, and for a $15 meal, it wasn't enough. It didn't even come w a salad, so I left starving and went to another restaurant. I probably won't come here anymore."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night for my husbands birthday. Atmosphere was good, not too many people eating out on a Monday. Nate, our server, was very attentive and always checked up on us and kept our drinks full. Food was delicious! The Mac and cheese was phenomenal highly recommend. The only problem was that I ordered my steak medium and it came out rare which I can usually handle but it was just too rare for my liking. Nate was with other customers but luckily the manager, Amy, checked up on us and I was able to send my steak back (which I don't usually like doing). Thankfully it came back really quick and it was the perfect temp. I will return next time I'm in the mood for Applebee's."}
{"text":"I'm giving these guys 4 stars cause we have never been disappointed coming here. Food has always been good, especially their 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 specials! Staff has always been great to us but most of all I love the location. Nowhere near a busy area so we've always been seated right away coming here and just been nothing but good experiences. Their Happy Hour is awesome too."}
{"text":"Me and my co worker stopped here for lunch. The staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar ordered our tortilla soup and oriental salad they were both delicious. The sangria is really good here and so is the bartender. Definitely recommend you stopping by."}
{"text":"Great service and good food! We really like Aaron, one of the waiters there who always seems to make our visits pleasurable. He always provides prompt service and seems to know what you need before you even have to ask."}
{"text":"My family and I have visited this location on numerous occasions and we have had great service. Unfortunately tonight's visit was far from superb as we are used to. We walked in and requested a BOOTH for 5, we told there was another group ahead of us and it would be 10- 15 minutes. When our table was finally ready for us 15 minutes later, it was not a booth. I told her specifically ,\"I requested a booth not a table with chairs.\" She responded with, \" I was not aware of that request.\" So I told her, \"I refuse this table since I requested a booth.\" She again responds, \" you didnt say anything of that sort when you walked in.\" At this point my fiance chimes in with, \"Actually, he said a booth for 5 please?\" The hostess then tells us,\"This table is all we have for you at this time and to wait for a booth will be another 30 minutes.\" I told her, \"Fine then we will will wait.\" She got an attitude and began gathering all the napkins and flat ware that she just laid out at the table along with the menus. At this point I was furious, more so because I was getting the attitude from someone who obviously had no concern for my request and then got upset when I corrected her. I was so mad that I was ready to leave and go elsewhere and when I expressed that to her. She retorted \"Fine, go somewhere else and eat I don't care!\" After hearing her say that I asked to speak to the manager, she completely ignored me and walked away. Another employee gladly got the attention of the manager for me and when I expressed my disbelief and how I felt so disrespected to him. All I was told is, \"I will talk to her about this this.\"  I'm sorry but when people come into your establishment and no matter what the situation is, automatically spend $60 or more on food and drinks you should do everything in your power to make them feel at ease. We finally got our booth in a matter of minutes after talking to the manager. To put the icing on the cake, I noticed after that anyone requesting a booth after we were seated got one right away. This had me heated, then my fiance told me,\" You made a  complaint, so now she is gonna do everything to make sure she doesn't get another one tonight.\"   To say the least I hope the young lady has a much better night. Our server EMO was great, he was very attentive and got everything correct! He turned my experience around for such an awful beginning."}
{"text":"A lot of people assume that all chain restaurant locations are more or less the same, but there is often a lot of variation between different locations. As far as Applebee's goes, the Mentor location is one of the best in my opinion. The food was good, the service was fast and polite, the restaurant was clean and inviting, and the price is right. It's everything you could ask for from a casual dining restaurant. No, it's not a super hip indie restaurant with certified fresh organic ingredients and trendy music piped in through the speakers. But of you've got twenty bucks in your pocket and you want to catch up with an old friend over a burger and a couple drinks, you could sure do a whole lot worse."}
{"text":"Okay, Here's the truth: I go to this Applebee's for dinner because my son and I can walk there from the movie theater, where we've been dropped off to see a show. The food is not very good. It's mostly out of a box or a bag that started in the freezer and prepared by someone with limited culinary training or authority. They are reheating and combining. What little comes fresh is often not fresh at all (think two to three item salads, with that one wonky tomato wedge). We once asked for steamed broccoli for my son and were brought a hunk of broccoli that had not even been trimmed -- stalk, leaves, and all. It had been lightly steamed, at least.   What's best are things like steaks, burgers, little sliders and other fried appetizers (because, well, fried), dessert shots (like pudding in a glass). The drinks are okay, too.   The tables are getting sticky with age. They're wiped off with a communal rag kept in a bucket of disinfectant stuff behind the greeters' podium (it just makes my skin crawl every time it comes out of the gray \"water\").   The best thing about the place is the staff. They're nice folks and well focused on customer service. We try to leave a good tip every time."}
{"text":"Always a good place to come. I love happy hour as all appetizers are half off! Makes for a decent break on the wallet. Usually pretty pack especially on weekends. Come early!"}
{"text":"Last time I was here I had a great time I ate good drank good... There Mudslides are freaking awesome."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends ... service was poor and I think the portions are not as large as they have been."}
{"text":"There wasn't one giant event that made me not want to eat here again but instead, a collection of smaller things that bugged me enough to decide we'll spend our money elsewhere.   We arrived at about 7 pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty full. The layout was weird so we weren't sure at first if it was \"seat yourself\" or whether we should wait for a hostess to appear. We chose to wait and it took an uncomfortable amount of time before a hostess finally deigned to seat us.   When we sat down, our table had no silverware and was sticky. We'd watched the hostess wipe it down but the weird residue that the rag left made me uncomfortable all night.   Our server swung by our table to tell us she'd be right back to take our order, but then she didn't come back for a really long time. When she did, she seemed rushed and asked us what food we wanted without even offering us drinks. We corrected her, ordered drinks, and then soups for an appetizer.   The french onion soup was meh at best. The flavor was off, it wasn't particularly hot, and the cheese was obviously low quality. When our food came out, we had to ask for silverware and napkins before we finally got them.   The entrees were definitely the best part of the meal. My boyfriend absolutely loved his burger and my pasta was okay. The chicken on top was definitely the best part.   When our bill came, it was around $50 for 2 sodas, two soups, and two entrees, which surprised me. There wasn't a mistake but for the quality we received, I kind of expected it to be less. When we go to Chili's or TGI Fridays and order similar meals, we get bigger portions and higher quality food for usually about $40.   So overall, it's acceptable but you can definitely do better."}
{"text":"Total lack of strong management on this day. I don't frequent this business; my experience leads me not to return. The servers were okay. VERY SLOW, and seemed a bit distraught. Never once saw a manager throughout the dining experience. Took forever for the drinks, apps, and food. Food was cold, and I was told the manager was on the line cooking. Make whatever excuses you may, but the restaurant wasn't even busy; 10 tables the 5 servers I saw on the floor. There are the most annoying flies there as well! Michelle clearly needed help but no team work was present. Just a overall bad experience."}
{"text":"I'm going to say 3.5 stars. I will give credit where credit is due.  I won a 25$ gift card to this \"Chain\"   It twas the Thursday Night 2 nights before Xmas. I met up with a couple of my BOYZ, and advised hey this one is one me.   Being a bit cautious I walked in and the place was moderately busy for 9:30 pm. We rolled up to the bar and noticed that they had winter ale, 4 bucks for a big one. Nice! My friend assured me that I would be OK, and I started to relax.   After sucking down a nice winter ale we noticed that all burgers were only 5$ after 9:00 pm and they came with fries. All Apps were like 4.50.   OK so we all ordered this burger that came with bacon, straw onions, and cheese. I asked if it could be cooked Medium Rare. The barkeep said they could make it pink. I like pink but only when it comes to meat!   Burgers came out perfectly cooked and were mighty tasty! The fries decent. I must say I felt like a mini Santa Claus after this, ho ho ho!  The service was polite and efficient. The bartender was stuck making some sort of ice cream liqueur concoction. he apologized and said he would be with us in just a minute.   I must say if I'm in this area and want to ingest 5000 calories for 5 bucks I know where to do it ,and just may do it again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Men's bathroom was absolutely disgusting and the stall door didn't even close."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at this restaurant with a friend and her daughter.   The food was good. We did the 2 for $25 deal. It's a great deal...appetizer and 2 entrees.   What I am going to rave about is the service. Jessica was our waitress and she was INCREDIBLE. Maybe one of the best servers in Las Vegas.   She was friendly and check on us and when my friend didn't like her food Jessica took it back no questions asked.   The service will be what brings me back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just left after several minutes of the same 2 servers walking past us again and again without saying a word, the amazing hostess even checking on us and going to tell someone we were still waiting, and still nothing. The place had less than 1/2 capacity, a lot of empty tables aside from in the bar, now I know why! Next place we left this establishment to go to: ordered immediately and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"We went to the Ajax Applebee's tonight for my wife's birthday. We waited 20 min. To be seated, on a Friday night that's not bad at all. We were then escorted to a table, no cutlery was available, but it wasn't required at the present time. We selected what we wanted from the menu and waited....waited.....waited, and no waitress ever showed up. So after 15 min. Of waiting we all got up and left.  Look on the bright side they cleared a table for more guests a lot faster then usual. So much for my loyalty cards. We are now across the street at the keg. We were seated in 15 min. and I have a drink in front of me already.  Don't waist your time at Applebee's go to the Keg."}
{"text":"One of the only reasons i go to applebee's is cause it is so close to my work and threes not much but fast food around me, but every time i go there I feel the service is not that great the food always takes so long. I got a soup and salad lunchtime deal and it took like 15min which i know is not that long but for salad and soup?? They are never that busy but again the service is slow, I for the most part should not have to flag down a waiter to get a refill.  I will start packing my lunch from now on :/"}
{"text":"Most the time the food is good, but I went there a few days ago with my fiance for their half-priced appetizers and felt differently. We got the quesadilla, two different kinds of wings, and pretzels and shared. The food was mediocre at best. There was a weird aftertaste for the pretzels and cheese dip. I got to go home and experience the pleasures of food poisoning. I'll be back, but it might be awhile, and I'll avoid the appetizers... I usually get the 2 for $20 shrimp... Service was fine."}
{"text":"Very clean and very nicely setup for a sports bar. Valerie is our server and she is very sweet and knows the menu inside and out. Thank God we have her helping us out. There are to many menus and they all have different deals, etc. Real confusing. The menus are very dirty, need to be replaced or cleaned more frequently. We just tried some apps that Valerie recommended and they were very good."}
{"text":"Dropped my daughter off at her in laws house in South Phoenix and my son and I had some time to kill before we had to pick her back up, and I wasn't into driving back into Chandler. I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's.  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years, and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for us.  So off we went, it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait, which we thought was pretty cool.  When we got to our booth, we talked about the times we had been there , and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery, it was fun talking about the old memories.  We went with the 2 for 20 deal, and the food tasted great, our service was friendly and fast, it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my, I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on,  he said mom, just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feet...I said WHAT!! He said yes, it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go, let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right then....but I didn't, I left the tip, because she was good, and we left.  Yes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse, he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guy.  BUT OMG!!! I hate mice, I will not be coming back, I know it happens more often than I would like to know about, this was a place that held some fun memories for us, but I am not looking to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Who tries to make reservations at Applebees?? ME that's who LOL,  I was coordinating a get together for my birthday, and we are all on a budget and the 2 for 20 works well and what I had thought was going to be a party of maybe 6 turned into a party of 16, for me that's great!! I was tickled pink that everyone wanted to come and celebrate my bday dinner, but then kinda like uh oh better call Applebees LOL So I called them with a hour's notice and they were shocked and said we don't take reservations I said ok but I have a party of 16 headed your way LOL they said they could make it happen! Way to Go Applebees!! Ok mind you we had to wait about 30 mins for our table, but we were a fun group and didn't mind the wait. I have to say our server was very nice and quick and didn't let anything fall through the cracks everyone got what they ordered and we had a great time. Some in the party where are not a Applebee's fan, but walked away with a great experience!  I for one am a fan of Applebee's and do plan on going back!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've gotten curb side Togo and it's the last. They not only have messed up and forgot things in my order they also didn't give us napkins or silver wear? I repeated on the phone at least five times that I wanted a some thing on the side and they completely forgot it. Never again Applebee's"}
{"text":"So-so.  We used to go here a lot but the quality started to go downhill.  My wife noticed it first.   I had a hard time admitting it because I liked this place but I had to after time.   The quality doesn't meet up to the price.   Their portions are smaller than we would like for the entrees and their flavors are absent.   The atmosphere of the place is typical \"chain restaurant/sports bar\".   Something we don't really like and consider somewhat cookie cutter and Sept 10. Sorry Applebee\"s but we would rather go elsewhere for better atmosphere and quality."}
{"text":"Very disappointed called ahead to see how long the wait was the guy told me 10 to 15 minutes just cause it was karaoke night which was fine so we get there and noones waiting in the lobby. But the tables were all full which was fine again, we expected it. Then the hostess tells us that its going to be an hour wait and says it very rude i might add. Im a server at a restaurant i understand how a wait works we would have waited maybe 20 minutes tops nobody is there for a concert. So obviously we left"}
{"text":"Air Conditioning wasn't working and we were there on  a day when it was 118.  The manager wasn't very helpful.  He basically told us all their customers were complaining it was too warm inside.  If they could have told us when we arrived that they were warm we would have gone somewhere else.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitress was ok. I really love applebees so it is a disappointment to rate then this low. First, they only have 4 ot 5 options for 1/2 off appetizers. Next, we ordered the spinach dip which eas one of my favorite items. Sadly, the chips were the kind you bit from the store. Salsa was soo small there was no point. I then ordered the classic burger. It was pretty burnt even though I said medium rare. Had no bacon and it just looked a hot mess! Fries were small portion and soggy. Definitely the last time coming here. Such a shame."}
{"text":"I have not been to an Applebee's in awhile.  The menu has changed but it still had a LOT of choices to pick from.  We were not aware of the 2 for $20 deal until the 2nd to the last page of the menu.  Why not?  Got the Southern BBQ boneless chicken for the appetizer.  The BBQ was not too bad.  The chicken was crispy and juicy.  I ordered the chicken tenders with fries and the hubby ordered the three cheese penne with chicken.  The chicken tenders were a little on the dry side.  The three cheese penne with chicken was not too bad.    Our server AJ kicked a$$.  He was on top of his game.  Always checking in on us and he attitude was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Had the ribblet dinner... it was ok.  I should have had the ribs.  The 2 for $20 deal is a great deal.  My mom got the bacon cheese burger.  The bread was hard.  I know normally their burgers are pretty good"}
{"text":"Applee's Server in Tempe Added $5 Tip to my Credit Card Receipt Dyllan S.  He was already paid a $9 Cash Tip.  So I'm visiting from NCAL and me and the parentals decide to go visit this Applebee's.  Hurrah I say.  I haven't had half priced pretzel sticks and beer cheese in years after Applebee's in Fremont charged me $8 extra for extra dipping cheese for the pretzel sticks (the promo picture showed a whole bowl but the actual quantity received was barely enough to dip 3 of 6 pretzel sticks).  We are seated and get to semi choose our booth.  We get our waiter.  He's a \"yeah cool, sweet\" apathetic millenial guy named Dyllan S (Remember this because he should not be working at any restaurant ever)  My parents ask about the PBR special.  It's $2.49 for the Brewtus.  My step mom says I thought it was $2.  I ask the waiter.  Is the 16oz $2?  He ignores me and goes on to say that the dos equis, etc. etc. is $2.  So what about the 16oz PBR?  Never addressed.  Suspecting he doesn't know.  Ask questions about the menu.  Waiter clueless.  Hear him give multiple excuses to other parties that he's only been working there for 2 weeks.  Yes, so why don't you know the menu, prices, and food?  My parents order the 2 for $25.  My Dad's riblets absolutely horrible.  He was struggling with them the entire meal.  He said no meat.  It's flat bones and weird.  I think he actually ordered extra riblets but wishes he wouldn't have.  My step mom seemed to be happy with her fiesta chicken.  I ordered the 6 oz sirloin (I know steak at Applebee's but I didn't really like anything else on the menu).  When I first ordered I noticed that the sides were only vegetables or potatoes.  I asked the server so no salads are includes as sides?  He gives some BS answer.  No but you can order a side salad for like $3 and it's a lot and you'll have extra.  OK how much is it really since you've already proven you know nothing about prices and menu?  I opt out and just get broccoli.  I had A-1 sauce new bottle but there was still something off about my sirloin.  Didn't get sick so that's good.  We're done.  I pay for the meal with my CC.  Parentals are not happy so I say hey pay for the tip. We gather the money.  $9 cash on a $47.97 tab after tax so Dyllan is getting 20% tip for service I personally would have rewarded a 5% tip to.  I'm reviewing my credit card statement today.  Hmmmm there's a charge for $52.97 at Applebee's.  I have the top level receipt.  Our total charge was $47.97.  The server added a $5 tip on the the credit card receipt.  I call my cc company.  They say dispute with Applebee's.  I call Applebee's and get a hold of Lou the Manager at the time.  He's going to refund my $5 but he asked nothing about my receipt number.  I wanted to verify the loser server was actually Dyllan S.  He said Dyllan was there for one day and borrowed from another store and that adding tips was a fireable offense.  Well you gotta have some better proof for firing Dyllan because he did steal money from me so I'll be contacting Applebee's again to see what's happening."}
{"text":"Last time I went I was very disappointed in the service. We had a large group so I can understand it taking a little longer than normal but our server took forever to ask us what we wanted to drink (we were a little later than the rest of the party who already had a drink). Also all the TVs were on a preface channel while there was another game that was actually on. I don't think I'd ever pick to go there again. Will only go if someone else wants to."}
{"text":"Eh. That pretty much sums everything up.  The food was just ok.  The service was just ok.  I have no reason to ever come back."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was fine, and the restaurant was clean. My friends and I had a good time. There was music, but it was low enough for us to still be able to talk to each other without disturbance. I'm not a picky eater, so I thought my food was good! I would recommend it. I had the All Day Brunch Burger."}
{"text":"Good food . Great service. Wendy the bartender went above and beyond to take care of us."}
{"text":"In the Fall of 2004 I moved on a whim to Charlotte, NC. I needed employment fast and I sauntered into this Applebee's and was immediately given a job. The Management and my coworkers were really amazing and immediately accepted me into their family. I didn't spend too much time in Charlotte but my best memories are intertwined with this Applebee's and the folks that I worked with. I know what this store is capable of and I hope that if it has gone downhill like some of the reviews state, that they will remember their core values and step their game back up."}
{"text":"Once seated, we were served by a very rude waitress. She was of no assistance with the menu. Consistently informing us of additional charges in a demeaning manor. I figured that would be the end of it, I was extremely wrong. I ordered my son the kids cheese burger. It resembled a meat ball with cheese on hamburger buns. The food preparation was horrible, I will stick to TGI for our next family meals..."}
{"text":"Food was really good ...  Great service ... Not too crowded so it was awesome for the kids ...would most definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The hostess was awesome. She held the door for me and had a bubbly personality. This is the type of person you want working at the front. I was seated right away. I had the steak with shrimp on top. It was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that the side of broccoli came in huge pieces. It was a little overwhelming and just different. I like broccoli but the pieces needs to be smaller, not the size of little trees.  My server was very nice and attentive.   The restaurant was clean but they were playing Spanish music the whole time I was there. It was just a little odd since this is a neighborhood grill. Other guests at the restaurant were also making comments regarding the music. The manager on duty was not seen at all. Normally they make their rounds which I feel is important."}
{"text":"Applebees has such great food, but the service is horrible. I went today and mind you it is a Monday night and it was very dead. It took forever for the server to come ask us what we wanted for dinner. He then would take awhile to keep refilling our water cups. His name was Jeremiah. He was such a nice guy and I felt bad because I think he was the only one server working. They should have had at least two waiters even though it was a slow night. There was no excuse for them to be this slow."}
{"text":"Bad service! I came here at 10:30 at night. My friend and I had to wait at least 15mins before anyone acknowledge us.  We had to ask a waiter if anyone was going to help us. Once we got someone to come to our table. She came with an attitude. It took them 45 mins to serve us the appetizer by the time we got to our meal we weren't even hungry anymore. I asked for a water and she forgot about my water never got a refill. This place was horrible for my first time coming here."}
{"text":"I actually joined Yelp just to write a review about the awesome customer service we received from our waitress Mia on Sunday evening. My husband, 3 children and I came in around 4 and were quickly seated. Mia brought over our menus, silverware, and high chair. She introduced herself and then proceeded to ask everyone their names which I have never seen before, she then starts with a charming personality and very easy going attitude. She acknowledged everyone by name including our 1 year old and was sure to bring us all the side condiments we asked for. She never missed a beat with refills and came back to check on us just enough times. The food itself was good but she really made it a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This is a chain and with any chain food is a 7.5 at best. It's more so convenience rather than preference. Now there is a 5 at this location and its a waitress I cannot recall her name but she's mid 30's blonde hair, heavy set woman. She is the best server in the place. Usually if I can sit in her section I leave. Other than that today when we went the food came out pretty fast but what made me quite upset was how long it took on refills and the young man seemed like he didn't want to help us. The best thing on the menu to me is the 2 for 20 or 2 for 25 you won't be displeased with anything on that section. Now my wife likes the pub grill diet salmon but I've never had it. I get ribs or the sirloin and for a chain the steak is pretty good. The management is quite friendly ironically they speak and are very cordial but quite a bit of the wait staff is impatient, rude, and could condescending."}

{"text":"I was so excited to find out that they had Happy Hour ALL weekend for St. Patty's Day! Had I known sooner... I would have camped out there! Bummed that Blue Moon is ONLY served from the bottle and not on tap any more :/ BOO! It was replaced by PBR (WHAT THE?!?!?!) BUT I recommend the boneless hot wings and asian won ton tacos MMMMM! (they give you 4 here where some places only give you 3!) Great Weight Watchers options that are delish even if you aren't on a diet. And you can't go wrong with the NEW Pub Pretzels. They are the perfect soft, warm, savory, and salty that you would want. They are always friendly, have all the games on, and it's very clean. Applebee's is our favorite go-to place any day of the week... but usually during happy hour is when you'll find us! #Applebees #fan #love"}
{"text":"This Applebee's does not deserve one star,it is the only way I can leave a review. Beware...!!! We had take out, so as I type this I am sick with food poisoning. The food was not that good either but when you spend your money you feel the need to at least try what you ordered.Never Again! BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"OK sooo I had never eaten here before until I worked here....Thank God I didn't waste my money here!!!   BIG YUCKO!   Where do I start? Well working here you got a major discount and a lot of the times the cooks would just give me free food! Let me tell you its all precooked microwave CRAP! I don't understand why people like this place and I don't understand how their still in business.   Working here I tried plenty of different meals such as their 3 cheese penne pasta, steaks appetizers you name it i tried it. I would never step foot in this restaurant again!   Please don't waste or time or your money eating here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch after I got off work. I work really early from 4:45 am to 12:00 pm  as a counselor, so it's nice to de stress and spend time with my beloved at the same time. We selected one of their featured lunch specials. We both chose the cheese burger with fries and onion rings. The food was fresh, hot and delicious. I added ice tea to my lunch and my husband had ice water. We had a wonderful waitress whom checked on us often to make sure everything was good. The ambience of the restaurant was low key, rather quiet which was nice for us. We enjoyed our meal and I recommend this location of Applebee's for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Horrible! Waited 40 minutes on a Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken. no one came up to us for 15 minutes and he was rude and dirty. waitress was rude and had dirty fingernails. she kept sighing and grunting and would just throw stuff on our table. hamburger was served raw. Literally RAW. Won't even go on about it. Ruined appledbees for me forever. Stay AWAY!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a celebration with daughter, s-i-l, and granddaughter.  Got seated quickly for a large party, and our server was great.  The problem was the kitchen.  I ordered the house special sirloin, medium rare, which is my usual order.  When the steak came (and it was the last of six plates out of the kitchen), the steak was vastly overdone - it was WELL done, and would have been inedible.  I asked the server to take it back, and by the time it came, everyone else had finished their meal---I don't believe that the kitchen put the right emphasis on replacing it.  When the second steak came, it was so full of gristle that I managed to get about 3 bites out of it...I left the rest of it on the plate.    This is truly the first time I've had a problem with Applebee's, and I've eaten in locations from Arizona to Tennessee and back.  I wasn't very impressed with this one."}
{"text":"My server was great and courteous! Food was ok. My drink was good! I would recommend this location for a fast bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is not too bad, but the staff is three screwdrivers short of a tool box.  I picked up a to go car side order, 10 minutes later a teen decides to grace me with his presence and show up at my car door.  I tell him my name, hand a gift card and he said he would be right back.  10 minutes after that confirms my pick up order and comes back to tell me my total.  I have to ping out to him to read the paper gift card I put in his hands.  Light bulb goes off and gets my food.  After all the back and forth 20 minutes later or so, I'm finally good to go.  The 2 for 20 is seldom 2 for 20 because they now have up-charges for many of their choices."}
{"text":"I love the fact you can order online and your food is brought to your car. Very convenient. Send my daughter for the pick ups. Love it."}
{"text":"Planned to have lunch & a drink (alcohol) w/my dad & bf.  The server carded me (I'm 30!!!) , she \"I can't take this ID, it's vertical\", when I gave her my (valid) license. I sat there till others were finished. Then I thought HEY! I have another (more recent) Government Issued ID! My Marijuana Medical License card w/my bday on it !!   The manager came out & told me... \"I'm sorry we can't take this ID either, *nervous chuckles*, we recently had a meeting on this, we cant take any of these ID's, sorry, I do believe that you're you. I know, I've been having the same problem cuz I'm 21 and I just had to get another license to make it horizontal\"   I said, \"Are u kidding me? You won't give me a drink, even though you said u believe these ID's are me !?!! & my dad is right here.\"    This is some bureaucratic bullshit!! WHY is Applebee's trying to FORCE me to go to the DMV, to get a 5$ license renewal, so it can be *horizontal* instead of vertical?!  Why the hell??? My card doesn't expire till 2049, whats the problem?  Applebee's, even when I do have *the right* direction of license card,  you will NOT be getting ANY buisiness from me!!  I ended up drinking water."}
{"text":"Food was awfulllllllllllll!!  Beer was good. Cold and fast.  Food was worse than TV dinners. Absolutely nothing at all like the TV commercial that brought me into the restaurant for dinner. Sloppy presentation. No taste.   What could be worse? I ordered a salad with chicken to go for my lunch at work the following day. Sooo, at work I remove my salad from the refrigerator and consider eating it. Two other employees asked me about the wilted brown-tipped broccoli in the container. I threw the entire container away without taking a bite. That was about $10-11 including tip tossed in the trash.   Next day after extensive searching for a contact for the Monroeville, PA location, I sent an e-mail describing my excellent beer, pretty good service, mediocre meal not finished and the terrible salad packaged to-go. There was no sarcasm at that time, just an honest description of the food and service.  The manager's  response was that I should ask for him or another manager when I returned. No refund offered. No \" come in for a free meal to offset two awful meals previously paid for.\" I would not return for a $100.00 gift card.   The experience and response fits Applebee's. Neither are worth consideration. Maybe that is why the restaurant was nearly empty when I visited.   Save your money. Get \"fast food\" instead. That would be better!"}
{"text":"I usually love Applebees and enjoy the food. Our lunchtime experience at the Steelyard location was very disappointing.  Service was horrible even though the place was empty.  After drinks arrived, long wait to order food.  Food came , another long wait but without utensils.  Could not locate server to get a fork, finally asked busboy.  Another wait! When the check arrived we were asked to donate money to their charity.  When we said no, the server rolled her eyes at us.  Saw that!  Another wait for change!   I understand waiting if place was busy but I could easily count the number of patrons in the room.   Sent a review to corporate office and was promised a reply in 3-5 business days.  No response after 2 weeks.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I sat at my table for 2 hours. My waiter came 2 times. When we were given our appetizers they were already cold and they didn't bring us plates or forks to eat our appetizers with. We had to stop someone passing by and ask for them. Then we were severed our food almost 1 hour later and I asked the guy that brought our food for a knife. How could I cut my dinner with no knife. He went around the entire restaurant asking people how their service was. And brought me no knife. I waited 17 minutes to get a knife. Worst experience ever. I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"We traveled all day and wanted to grab a quick bite before checking into our hotel so we chose this place. Been to Applebee's before and honestly they have not been great, but this was by far the worst ever. Should have checked Yelp first!  We were seated by the hostess quickly , good start right? Wrong. We sat for over 15 minutes with many servers passing us including the one assigned to our table. Another server we had not seen stopped by and asked if we had been helped. He took our drink order and was extremely pleasant. Waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes. Ordered and received our food my wife ordered the Asian salad and started eating and when she got to the bottom of the bowl a hair was at the bottom. Called manager and he came over. Not very customer service oriented. My wife had to ask if the salad would be compensated after he asked if she would like something else to which he responded, sure apologized and left. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Applebees is rarely on my radar.  Thanks to a gift card , I found myself here,  and really enjoyed this visit from beginning to end.  The convenient location, and the warm greeting we received as we entered, got things off to a pleasant start.  We were given several seating options vs just being led to a designated table.  Seating, and overall surroundings, are comfortable, and inviting.  Nice lay-out  with a locally based decor theme. I suppose this is where the \"neighborhood \" reference comes into play.  The menu is easy to follow, and offers some decent choices.  I was really pleased to see that the menu description matched up with what was being served.  Relief!  I am always disappointed when the description is better than the actual food.  Our server was upbeat, and focused, even though we were in the midst of a relentless snowstorm outside.  I know I was thankful to be inside enjoying a satisfying meal and drinks.    I hope my future visits are just as enjoyable.  With, or without a gift card!"}
{"text":"This is usually my go to Applebee's. But today I met a waiter Luis B. who seems to hate his job. It's Tuesday at 1pm very slow day. Took him about 10 minutes just to ask for our drinks, wanted to rush us out so he could hang out at the bar with the hostess who also seemed to be inattentive with guests. Don't get me wrong I always go here and have a great time. When he finally came back we ordered 2 burgers, he rushed said ok and left didn't ask us what style we wanted the meat and assumed French fries. Once he gave us the burger he ran off back to the bar. I waved him down he made a face and came back. I asked for hot sauce took him I kid you not 9 minutes to bring one Tabasco! Nobody was in the restaurant. Oh he did ask to refill our drinks when we finished the food!! Overall I was so displeased. If I could give the 0 I would."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service is just horrible , first of all we had to wait for 15 to get a table and seeing there were about 10 tables available. Second our waiter was nice at first but then we never seen her come back after we finished eating and then she randomly comes and takes my boyfriends cup and says I'll give you a refill, found that very rude , and last another waiter (the waiter that brought our food) she just came and gave us our plates but with an attitude and didn't say one word , I don't recommend going here if you're really hungry you'll wait long"}
{"text":"I ordered the trio special (artichoke dip, boneless buffalo wings, and sliders) all for $12 bucks. This is MONSTEROUS.  Make sure you either are super hungry or are sharing this with someone.  I had about 8 wings and two decent size sliders.  There were so much tortilla chips for the dip it didn't even look like I made a dent in it.    The food is exactly what you expect of Applebee's.  I prefer their regular wings (with bones).   Service was slow (it was noon).    FYI:  Make sure you go you bring your own hand wipes.  The bathroom is nasty."}
{"text":"The service is good and fast! They are really nice there and the food is delicious!!!   I love Applebees !!!!"}
{"text":"I was here last night during reverse happy hour. It was awful. They had soooo many people working but it still look forever for everything. We ordered a blue moon and a Bahama Mama. They brought 2 blue moons. When my gf told them the mistake they just took one of the beers & walked off. 10 minutes later she had to flag down another server to reorder my drink. Even then it took another 15 mins to get my drink. No apologies or anything. Rude."}
{"text":"Lunch special was great.  Pretty hard to mess up soup and salad.  Then again I have had a soup and salad that wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Burger Monday. Whiskey and brunch. Whiskey was real good. I added jalape√±os. They added a nice flavor. My beautiful wife enjoyed the Brunch burger"}
{"text":"I don't go to this location often and had not been here in years, but decided to stop in for lunch with my Mom after we finished up at the nearby Target. This place is in a great location and I really like the location by my home. We walked in and were not greeted by a hostess, not something I am used to at an Applebee's. The hostess came by within a few minutes and took our name down and said it would be about 30 minutes. Okay- doesn't look that busy, but what do we know. There was another group already waiting and then a woman and her child came in after us- they left rather than wait. We were seated and greeted by a server after a few minutes. The server was friendly and polite, but I heard the same story about three different times between our table and two nearby. He said he had only been working here for about a month and that he would do his best, we said no biggie as long as the food is good and you keep us updated.  It felt like ages between the appetizer, entr√©e and check... it was also forever before we were given silverware or even napkins. I watched my mom squeeze lemon everywhere, and then have it stuck on her hands with nowhere to clean them off.  The we got a two for $20 deal... the salads came out and were doused with dressing. The lettuce was either not washed or just old, there were brown spots on it everywhere so I was leaning towards old lettuce. My mom had the um, steak stir fry and I had the fiesta lime chicken. She enjoyed her meal but I wasn't impressed with mine, I think the salad just let me down.  We saw tables in our section get up and move to other sections. The server was not bad, just talkative. I could tell you his career goals for the industry, and this was only our first time meeting him. I can't really remember ever eating at this location, well nothing other than an appetizer with a pint so I really cannot say whether this was a fluke visit or a normal occurrence."}
{"text":"We are becoming quite the regulars here! Its so refreshing to get off work and have somewhere to look forward to going to get the same service we strive to give at our jobs ! Big thanks to Jane our server tonight, great suggestions and great personality :-)"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Cub game and grab dinner and a drink. We had to ask them to change the channel which was handled without any issue, but they left something that required a selection up on the screen. We asked our server if she could fix it, so she asked a bartender which was rude and short with her. He said he was slammed and didn't have the time. We were shocked, she covered for him and everything was okay. Then we saw how the bartender treated others...  he kind of pushed the balloon person out of his way and he just seemed like he had better places to be. His attitude bothered us and we (my boyfriend and I) agreed we would ask to move if we were ever sat in his section. Well, our server was great and the service we received from her was awesome! Oh, the Cubs won... we may have a new tradition."}
{"text":"It's Applebee's. Beer is great and the food sucks most of the time.   Most of the time my order is right but it seems more often than not they mess up!   Today I order the all day bunch burger.  The egg on it was over cooked ( It looked like a fry boiled egg)  and the burger was pink like super rare pink. I asked for no pink but I'm okay with medium rare pink tho.   So come here, Eat and Drink but make sure your order is right!"}
{"text":"My mother and I ordered the choose 3 appetizers for $12.99 deal for lunch today. We ordered two french onion soups & pretzels and cheese. After waiting 25 minutes the server came and said that she was just told they have no more pretzels which confused us because they could have told us 25 minutes ago. The manager came up and apologized saying it was her fault because she was short staffed and busy and couldn't relay the message to the server fast enough. We then got spinach dip to replace the pretzels and it was disgusting. They took the dip away and ended up taking it off the bill and one of the soups. The soup was awesome but the management was terrible. She had enough time to relay the message because she was conversing at the bar for ten minutes. Very disappointed and will not be returning to this applebees anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have always loved Applebee's. This location is one of the reasons why. Excellent service, friendly, knowledgable, attentive, but not annoying. I haven't had a bad anything from here."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Sean was our service did an amazing job ( although he has the same talking points for all his tables lol ) he's a great server! Our food was delicious! & That 2 for 25 menu is great! Highly suggest it. Me and my friend have came here many times and we really enjoy this Applebee's we visit quite often and always great food and great service :)"}
{"text":"I visited this new Applebee's with a friend.   It's Kinda hard to find at night so you guys should light up that sign so we can see it. As well add some lighting to that back path to get there.   Jay was my server. He was decent and pleasant but seemed really rehearsed.   My Perfect Margaritas took 20 minutes to come out but that wasn't my servers fault. We watched the bartender just not make them.   I ordered the onion Soup and it wasn't hot. I ate it cuz I love onion soup and I hate sending food back.   I wasn't the happiest about this visit but I love Applebee's so I'll be back. Just get it together guys.   #ColorTheCritic"}
{"text":"The service is always great and the food very tasty. They also are far enough away from the majority of town they rarely have a wait even on busy weekends."}
{"text":"Always promptly greeted with a friendly smile.  I visit at least 3-4 times a month.  The food is always fresh, and quick service in the bar area.  Definitely not as busy as other Applebees I've visited, but no wait makes it great!!"}
{"text":"I took my 9 yr old daughter to lunch- I was happy to see new sandwhiches added to the menu-- hostess pointed out kiosk on table - my 9 yr old immediatly scans it and checks out the kids games link -said to me O it says 1.99 I tell her O don't touch- we ignore - of course bill comes there is $1.99 charge snuck on there- waitress seems annoyed I asked for it to b removed- beware of these table side kiosks it's a rip off scam and it's completely redicioulous- food was  good- server was ok-"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party with about 13 of us from the office. Food was good and the price was right. I had the lunch combo with the 4 cheese Mac & cheese with bacon and honey pepper chicken and the California shrimp salad. Both were tasty. The best part though was the $.99 brownie bite with a tiny scoop of ice cream for dessert. Just the perfect size! Service was good especially considering how big our party was."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, the hostess sat down and ate the taco order we were waiting on and it was not even busy. Still waiting on a steak knife and ketchup."}
{"text":"always get the oriental chicken salad best salad ever always the same  great staff ice cold beer steak is always cooked how you want it and good"}
{"text":"Had a perfect Patron margarita which was delicious! I really don't care for the food at Applebee's due to their limited menu and lack of seasoning. I had the crosscut ribs appetizer and spin dip both were pretty good! Great waitress, no wait time overall great experience."}
{"text":"We live in one of the gated communities on south mountain. Been eating at applebees probably once a week. Lately we have been going in and leaving without even sitting down. Seems to be a weird and aweful smell and can not stomache."}
{"text":"Lol. This place literally makes me laugh when I think about how shit their service is. We went in. I asked to sit at a booth and was denied. Said it would be 15 minutes. We were then seated and said our waiter would be right there. We waited 15 minutes, no \"just give me a couple more minutes or anything. We didn't even get to see our server. We waited an additional 5 and still nothing, so we walked out. After reading the other reviews I see most people have had this issue. F Apple bees. I'd give it zero Stars if I could lol."}
{"text":"Decided to stop and get food before leaving on our flight. We walked in and were greeted and seated. Then, CRICKETS! The server walked by our table 3 or 4 times, never smiled, never greeted us, and definitely did not indicate she'd take our order. The bartender, female, disappeared for over 5 minutes as did the server and front door host. We got up and left.  Worst service ever. Hmmm, manager! You have a problem!"}
{"text":"Under staffed and needs to work on higene ......food quality of average ..... not worth the drive ......needs improvement in cleanliness specially for restrooms"}
{"text":"Wow...was not expecting to leave such a great review for Applebee's but both my back to back visits at this location were amazing to say the least. The first night we picked up some late night snacks and they were on point, today when we ordered for lunch it got even better, the steak was cooked perfectly to my liking even for being a pick up order, they perfected it! You guys killed it! Oh the staff and manager were very helpful, courteous and full of life!"}
{"text":"Okay Applebee's is not my favorite and never has been .. especially this one where the pleasant hostess seems to be way to serious and the polite servers are slow as molasses.  So why the 4 rating!  Because today they are winning me back.  First of all there was the new server and the old server .. the new server took our order, got our drinks and brought our food .. turns out we weren't her table, she just did it because she saw us waiting so long .. the old server took back over and our drinks were dry and it took forever to check out!  Yay new server!  can we bet more like her!  Next winner, the new manager that checked on us, very nice and talkative, made us feel comfortable and finally the menu changes!  I had this thing they call a Wonton Taco!  WOW!  That was fantastic.  It's an appetizer but I had it for lunch and was completely satisfied.  Never thought I'd say this about Applebee's but I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered take out from this location and it was absolutely disappointing. First of all, they told us our order would be ready at 9 pm and we didnt get our food until 9:45. Second of all, we ordered the Triple Hog Dare You which was so bad that my boyfriend didn't eat it. We also ordered cheese fries which looked and tasted like they were a day old, again, we didn't even eat them. I also ordered the shrimp scampi. It had way too much butter and the breadstick was stale. For our whole meal we paid $45 and waited over 1 hour. This is the second chance we give this Applebees and it is safe to say I will never be returning. The service is bad and the food is worse."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere different to go, we decided to drive to Applebee's, just like that at random.   We usually go to the location in Niagara Falls and have been to the one in Barrie (which usually sucks) so expectations wasn't high.  The 2 for $30 is a good deal. (One appetizer, two main meals) some chain restaurants want $30 for one meal so this is a pretty decent offer.  We had a super nice server, who used to work at the location in Mississauga (which is now closed) It always makes for a pleasant dinner when you have a friendly server.   We both ordered fiesta lime chicken, I believe it was called which is what we usually end up ordering on the 2 for $30 menu and I have to say it was probably the best one I've had!  I will surely come to this location again, just not sure when.."}
{"text":"The thing about Applebee's is that you know what you're getting. Or you think you do. We stopped in last night around 9 pm and sat at the bar to have a quick bite and a drink. There were about 5 other people at the bar. The service bar was busy and there was only one bartender on. Now all that is fine, I've worked in food service for many years, I understand better than many the challenges of juggling the needs of people and trying to manage my space.   This woman, however, did not. She clearly understood how to make all the drinks (pink ones green ones, crazy Applebee special drinks whatever). Sadly, she never thought to say hello, wipe the bar in front of us, or be with you in a minute or anything. Eventually she came by and tossed down a couple of sticky menus and left again. We got drinks and ordered, someone from the kitchen brought out food (mine on a plate with fingerprints all over it, ugh) but didn't feel the need to offer silverware, salt and pepper or the like. (There was no silverware behind the bar, she had to go retrieve some from somewhere) I watched in dismay as dirty dishes piled up on the end of the bar, drinks and dirty glasses were crowded side by side at the service bar, and I swear there was no telling what was what. It was disgusting.   I kept looking for the manager, thinking he should be helping her, when finally he stopped by with his hands full of dirty dishes to ask us if he could take our plates (by this time we had finished and I was hoping to be cashed out in the near future) He did not ask us how everything was, which gave us a chuckle, because he would've gotten an ear full. We did ask to speak to him on the way out and let him know we were unhappy. He said \"Next time get me involved sooner\". My friend said \"How about you give her a talk on customer service for next time?\"  I know people go through things, maybe something terrible had happened to her that day, I don't know (in which case her manager should have been supporting her) but I can tell you there won't be a next time for me. There are tons of places to eat around there, Applebee's doesn't even need to make the list."}

{"text":"Quick lunch-(for dinner) cedar grilled chicken. A supposedly smaller dish that is still enough for leftovers. The flavor is excellent-a bit sweet from the cranberries and tart from the lemon- a good combination that raves to be eaten! So it's a go for Applebee's in my book. And of course the menu is varied so mostly there's likely something for everyone's taste. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The epitome of a crap chain.  Why did I get talked into going here?  Because I am a tool.  Crowded, loud, mediocre food, slow service, and on this particular occasion a strange man two tables down and across the aisle staring at me and not his dining companion, during the entire meal.  I should have just yelled, \"watch my head spin\" and vomited there at the table."}
{"text":"This food chain needs to go. The food is meh as always, and the look is okay. Wouldn't come back, ever Lol."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here for dinner on a Friday night ( 2 weeks ago to be exact), & not even 2 minutes after we walked in, we were greeted by a very friendly host & seated right away. Our server (I believe his name was Ryan), was pretty awesome, the food was excellent ( I recommend the 3-cheese macaroni from the 2 for $25 entrees; NOM NOM NOM!) , & the prices are really reasonable-especially for the amount of food you get. They pay attention to their patrons & you definitely feel welcome there. Give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Good Food but I think the blaring rap music was s bit much. Applebee's last I checked was a family resturaunt it was very unclassy to watch the wait staff jiving and rapping lyrics along the songs with the manager sitting in a chair in a corner booth jerking his head to the music. Had my 8 yr old with us and half the words did not needed to heard by anyone's ears!"}
{"text":"Applebee's offers a great happy hour, \"The 2 for 20\" deal and tons of drinks to choose from....A great Family/Friend spot with booze :D I like this Location because It's always very clean and the servers are great."}
{"text":"Usually it's a hit or miss when I come to any Applebee's. Came in  with my family and we ordered from happy hour and a few drinks from the bar. Omar was our server and he was one of the best we've had. He was fast, like suuuuper fast we didn't even have to ask him for anything. Our drinks from the bar came within 5 minutes which has never happened before. My boyfriend did not like the Long Island ice tea and Omar was kind enough to take it off our bill. Will be asking for Omar whenever we come here from now on!"}
{"text":"Applebees is always good for a quick bite to eat without having to go to a fast food restaurant. I ordered the side salad which one of the better side appetizer salads. It includes bacon, cheese, cucumber, tomato, and croutons. For dressing I ordered the honey balsamic which isn't as good as their old hot bacon dressing but it's pretty good. My main meal I ordered one of the lesser calorie dishes, the cider grilled lemon chicken with rice cranberries apples and quinoa. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was great, we loved it.  Our server, Matthew, was totally awesome.  I do believe he is the best server we have ever had.  Great job Matthew.  We hope to see you again.  You are great."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I have been going to this location for a couple of years now. We will not go back due to their lack of customer service. Last time we went their \"Happy Hour\" bud light special was $5.50 and when we inquired with the waitress she said that it was discounted for happy hour. We then asked to speak to a manager who we saw 10 minutes earlier. She said she did not know where he was, so we left our number  so that he could call us back and we could ask about the changes. He has yet to call us back. So they have lost our business."}
{"text":"Had to give 1 star, However they did not deserve one. This place is awful and the manager is very rude. Went there Saturday night for happy hour. The place was not super full however it took 20 mins to have a rude waitress come ask for drinks and that took 15 more minutes. I asked for the manager and he was extremely rude! My party had to leave and will never return to that awful place."}
{"text":"I came back and gave this location another try when the manager called me and discussed why my visit was so horrible.  When I walked in, the energy felt like a new place. I don't know if they got rid of the staff members who seemed very out of it, but it was nice to not see them around. They were actually wearing uniforms this time and seemed like they cared about the customers. I don't know what the manager did, but keep it up! We will because of the improvements we saw!"}
{"text":"the food was very cold the butter wouldn't melt,bad service and no manager to be found ,oh the hostesse stand there with the waitresses and talks crap on everyone in there, I heard nothing but negative things about everyone eating (the customers)and they sat this older man up on the booth side he couldn't even walk up or down the steps ,my heart when out to him and they dident even open the door for him ,if you like very cold food you will get it there for sure !!!:((("}
{"text":"Steak here has never disappointed us.  One of my regulars the bourbon steak.  Some of the best tasting steaks around and I've tried the pricey and the cheap.  This beats some of the pricier places by far.  Great with mash potatoes!"}
{"text":"So I never go into Applebee's,there is only one in the area where I live, about 10 miles away so when I visited my folks in the Anthem area of Henderson I thought why not, it's not a place I would normally go to but the food was Delish, the staff was friendly and the service was good...I left there and forgot my wallet and so i called the they called me two days later and they had found it with all of my contents still inside....Many, Many Thanks"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my steak it was cooked just as I asked and my waitress was very helpful . Nothing wrong with this Applebee's !"}
{"text":"It's always good and gas ...happy hour is really good the wonton tacos are the best in the West!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly clean, friendly attentive staff and accommodating.  I was in a hurry with a party of 5.  We were paired with a great server Des.  My only complaint was hair in my salad and the pasta dish didn't look as good as the photo.   It did however taste wonderful.   The salad was fixed.   Thank you team for getting us in and out abd filling up our tea."}
{"text":"Awesome food, nice atmosphere, and if your server is as good as Owen you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Now I'm a loyal Applebees customer to Avon and North Olmsted, but I ventured here during the holiday season and boy am I glad I did. Service was fast and good.  I always order the veggie patch pizza, not on the menu but they still make it and it is awesome, see pics!   Apparently during happy hour my entree and app was half price! My total was $7, I mean come on, that is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Out of North Olmsted, Fairview, and Westlake, I choose Avon Applebees. I love love love the staff here, super friendly and always willing to go out of their way for a customer. Food is always good, portions are big, and it comes in a timely manner. Out of the numerous times I've been to this location, I have never had to wait, which is a plus.   I have also done carside to go once, which was OK, I had to wait a little longer than planned, but still it was worth waiting, because the veggie patch pizza is awesome :)"}
{"text":"Half price appetizers, yes please!   Dave is the best server - ask for him!  Love all the half price appetizers, got them all, they were all wonderful.   Only minus was that we sat in a corner area and that part was pretty cool so food (and me) got cold quick. Not a big deal.   Overall, if you can wait till 10pm on a Saturday or whenever they have the deal - go for it!"}
{"text":"Horrendous! My friend and I went on 2/24/18 around 12:30pm. At first our waitress was really friendly, she took our drink orders (two milk shakes). It took about 15 minutes for her to bring us the milk shakes and she gave us water. She gives Rachel hers and then she gives me mine and it was overflowing which then caused a mess at the table. She said \"sorry the bartender kind of overflowed it, so just drink it fast.\" Which whatever, okay would have been fine I guess, but then I had to use my napkin that I planning to use when we got our meal. The waitress didn't give me any more napkins to wipe off the glass or give me a coaster. I work in customer service and presentation is everything and I would never have given a customer something like that and expected them to clean it up thereselves. The table and my hands were really sticky then from the shake and trying to clean it up. The waitress takes our order and and I had gotten a burger and asked for ranch for the fries. She said \"okay\" wrote it down and walked away. Some time went by and an other waitress brings us our food, literally drops it off to us and hurried up and left before we could ask for more napkins and I could ask for the ranch that was forgotten. Rachel and I went through almost our whole meal without The waitress checking on us, we never got our water refilled, and when she finally came and asked how everything was. I asked (because I saved my fries for last) for ranch. She says \"okay of course.\" She never came back! She gave us our checks, we paid and left. Overall it was not a satisfactory visit."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner (they were not very busy) we waited for about ten minutes.  The waitress came by once & said she'd be right back.  Ten minutes & not even stopping for a drink order,  really?   Four empty tables right around us & still crappie service!   Clearly you didn't want my business.  The service has definately gotten worse over the years & maybe it's time we never return!   I see why you only have 2 1/2 stars on yelp!"}
{"text":"This Applebee's DESERVES a 5 star rating all around!  It is by far my favorite place to go to eat.  So affordable to take my family to dinner every time, great food & i LOVE their sweet potato fries.  I always have excellent cust service here.  Fast, friendly, and attentive.  Even the host last night , he was so friendly and sweet. Or server Donald waa exceptional as well.  I will return as much as I can especially to this specific location.  LOVE U GUYS!"}
{"text":"Plenty of seating but still told there was a 25-30 minute wait time. We sat at the bar and watched the 3 couples ahead of us get seated and then 2 that came in after us. All the while there was 3 dirty tables in the bar. Asked the hostess if someone could clean one of them and she said  no, they were for people waiting. The bartender Monica was super sweet and helpful and got the manager. He had a table cleaned for us and the hostess put someone at it. Fine we took the next table. It took our server 10 minutes to get to us and while waiting for our food my bf noticed something floating in my drink. GROSS... Then when we got our food our server didn't give us any silverware or napkins. THANK GOODNESS for Monica. Again she came to the rescue. I wish I could remember the managers name. He was super helpful and very apologetic. 1 star for Monica and 1 star for the sweet manager."}
{"text":"This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Service was terrible, food was terrible..... Waited 10 mins to order drinks.  The mozzarella sticks were not melted.  The sirloin was cooked right temperature but had a terrible taste. Waitress never even checked back to see how our food was, even thought my entire steak was still on the plate pushed to end of table.   I now know why it was so empty when we got here.  I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"My fianc√©, his family, and I ordered to go from here and all of us were a bit unimpressed. I ordered the maple glaze salmon with garlic potatoes, which sounded quite good. However, when we picked it up and drove back to our hotel (couple minutes away) it was cold and the mashed potatoes were hard. Now, being a person with only one known allergy (dust), I was quite surprised when I took a bite and started getting similar effects to when I have an allergic reaction. So after we checked the ingredients twice to see if there was anything out of the ordinary (Im a regular consumer of potatoes, maple syrup, peppercorns, salmon, etc. You name it) we noticed nothing in the ingredients would've made me break out so badly. While weird, I'd rather not take my chances again with that apple bees."}
{"text":"Stale chips and bartender kept turning up the R&B music louder and louder. We dined from 9:30-10:30pm, by 10:30 my wife and I could barely hear each other talking."}
{"text":"I've been to many applebees and this was the worst.  Poor service,  food seemed like it was cooked by a kid with no love.  Burnt food and generally small portions.  I'll skip this chain from now on and just go to nearby pubs"}
{"text":"Had a great server, nice small town atmosphere. Can tell lots of regulars come here. They even helped us out with some special food needs and didn't charge us extra! The salads were yummy too!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever received from any Applebee's I've ever been to. The waiter was very inaccurate with our order, and we had to wait 30 minutes for our appetizer and 45 for our entrees. Also, when inquired about the Spinach Artichoke Cavatappi with its taste, we were told that it was \"green\", and that was about it.Today was supposed to kick off my 25th birthday, and this lunch hasn't started it off right. Not even the ice cream we received was good. Just a lump of ice cream with very little chocolate sauce at the very bottom of the cup. Highly dissatisfied with my visit to this location, and I will never come back."}
{"text":"I usually don't frequent Applebees but there's a good reason why this location has 2 stars. We sent one meal back because it came out cold, only to get a steak so inedible that I wouldn't feed it to my enemies dog. The only saving grace was our server, Leah was very nice and made it right by having it taken off the bill. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food for the price I wouldn't say great. I think it's the cook sometimes. I never had an issue with service. Sometimes the food I ordered is a bit salty or cold and other times it's great. But for the price the portions are good."}
{"text":"Loved our server Jaime!  Loved their Brew Pub Pretzels!  Love their Take Two Seasonal Menu, the Green Goddess Wedge Salad, and the  Lemon Shrimp Fettucine!  Rocky Bleier was there! Yay!"}
{"text":"Went in today for dinner. Ordered the 17.99 steak with parm and shrimp. Literally 1/3 of the steak was fat. I showed the waitress, she said I'm sorry and that was that. I really know I should not expect a lot but she showed the manager and ... Nothing. We gave Applebee's a shot but honestly go to Chilis . I have never had a bad meal there . Applebee's is hit and miss. I just hate paying 17 bucks for fat."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I can't/won't work for a cooperate structure anymore... So I stopped in to an Applebees to have some cold drink & food, the bar tender is so sweet & atentative...every thing was hunky dory until another paytron decides to start being abusive.  They stated she comes in all the time, complains, makes a scene & gets stuff for free.  I finally had to speak up because the bartender did mot deserve this unwarranted abuse!  The manager came out a couple times, spoke with her...and nothing happened!  This bartender STILL HAD TO SERVE HER & ENDURE MORE OF HER B.S.!!!  W.T.H.?!?! Having worked the industry & still having friends in the industry....I am slamming corporate but GIVING HUGE CUDOS to Rachel at Applebee's on 9330 W. Northern in Glendale.  I didn't let that belligerent ruin my experience & I'll be back,  ONLY when Rachel is there!  Also my burger was overcooked, bun was dry & everything over salted.  Honestly...the only good part about my experience was the staff."}
{"text":"This location is amazing. THANK YOU FERNANDO for going above and beyond. I got this post card in the mail after I moved in my new home. Said $25 gift card for applebees. I went to the location and they have no idea what this is. Come to find out it's some scam where they want to have you agree to some water test. Luckily I had some cash on me and Fernando the manager still gave me $10 off my order since I was already here and just to be helpful. I will definitely come to this location a lot more just because of this. It has nothing to do with the money. I couldn't careless about the cost. But the friendliness and get customer service means everything to me. Great job guys"}
{"text":"This time around was bad, bad, BAD. We came in, no hello nor \"how many in your party\"  no greetings really. The manager looked our way twice and still didnt check to see if we needed help. He was chatting with some friends. 10 mins into arriving someone finally came by as asked either booth or table. We sat down and started to order the waiter was extremely nice and the food came by real fast that would be the only reason why I gave this restaurant a 2 star other than that we still had to wait a very long time to be seated. When we were leaving not even a goodbye nor come again it really didn't feel like I was welcome this time."}
{"text":"I think Applebees is what it is. A chain restaurant with average food. A coworker of mine wanted to go for lunch so we went. No real options for a vegetarian and even the salads are not noteworthy and all with meat. I did order the house salad which was fine (without bacon). My friend ordered the steak salad. I chose not to take a pic and now wish I had. The whole salad was a greyish color... from the dressing? He said the steak was overcooked and the lettuce looked old. Side note: our server was great! Super friendly and attentative.  There are so many options in Tempe. Why go to a chain that really doesn't care about the quality of their mass produced recipes when you can eat at one of the wonderful local restaurants all around the area."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and still had to wait another 10 additional minutes for our waters.  When we asked for a lemon for a drink, the the waiter came back with a whole bowl of lemons to be rude. When they finally came out with waters and the bus boy asked if we wanted straws, someone replied yes, he threw 10 straws on the table.  Customer service has been awful and I would not return."}
{"text":"Level this place - pleeeeese. It can't go on and neither can I keep trying to give it yet one more try"}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent.  I've ordered beef too many times and have not been happy.  I sent it back once because it was overcooked.  I asked for it medium rare/pink in the middle.  It wasn't pink.  The waiter tried to tell me it was.  Except for the one time the waiter told me my meat was cooked to order, the wait staff has been friendly,  We usually go here because it's close and convenient."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of days ago for dinner with a friend; it was not impressive.  A friend and I are both calorie-counting right now and due to the new Diet-Conscious menu that Applebee's is so heavily advertising, we decided to give it a try. This was pretty stupid on our part...   PROS: The \"Under 500 Calorie Meal\" options on the menu; Average Pricing; Restrooms were clean. Our waitress was nice and was willing to answer the questions that we asked about the menu.  CONS: Food Quality is somewhere between Good and Fair; My plate came out looking like someone had just slopped the food onto it; Nothing too original on the menu; They don't carry any Low or No Fat Salad Dressings.  All in all, this wasn't that good of a trip--it was \"okay\", at best. If you're interested in some sub-par chain restaurant food... go for it! If you go here thinking that you'll be able to watch your waistline AND eat some good food, you're heading towards disappointment."}
{"text":"Being that I'm in the service industry myself, I understand the dynamic of how a restaurant is ran. This place, SUCKED!!! I went with my mother to dinner. I asked to sit out on the patio, they said, no because they had no one serving the outside tables. I asked if I could sit out there anyways, and I will go to the bar place my order, and the food runner can just bring out our food. Im doing all the leg work, and I didnt want to be stuck inside a stuffy restaurant. They still said no. We waited 15 mins to be sat, resonable until I saw all the unbussed drty tables. No servers, No Bussers, No Food Runner either, lack of complete staff. They had a new bartender who had completely screwed up making their new Mango Jalapeno Margarita I had ordered. Over doing it on the mango puree making it a smoothie and you couldn't taste anything else in it. It had to be remade. Our appetizers took 20 minutes. Our waiter was very attentive and apologetic. Then he got cut and was replaced with Brittany. You could tell she didn't want to be there, which later she confirmed when I over heard her complaining about her job to another server. If you don't like your job, get a new one."}
{"text":"Bad barmaid service from Amanda. Not the one who has been there for 9yrs. Only paid attention to the men, including her boss (of another job). Didnt ask about how my drink was (which are more than $12 each...) or make any conversation beyond my initial drink order. Not a busy time either. Just ridiculous. Last time I came I was helped by Kimberly, who is wonderful and attentive and the cooks made the best food (steaks!) id ever had at any applebees. But I will walk out if I ever see this Amanda barmaid again. Not even worth ordering food or a second drink.  I got a tip for her, pay attention. Be genuine. EARN your money! She should be embarrassed at her neglect of patrons. Especially when they're unknowingly there often. Disappointing. The Amanda who has been here for quite some time is personable, respectful & honest. Good worker. The company is lucky to have her."}
{"text":"Food was good, but \"Samantha\" pretty much ignored me. I had to leave my table and walk across the restaurant to the bar to get a refill on my Diet Pepsi."}
{"text":"Nice place. Not fine dining of course. Clean environment  & happy employees. Had a good time & can't beat the prices for the portions & quality. I know everyone is a critic & wants $1 well drinks or giant kids meals, but wanted to say this place is just right. Thank you"}
{"text":"We wanted a comfortable, non-fast food, but fast service place to eat supper and chose Applebees. The place was crowded and the wait was 15-20 minutes. I ordered the blackened steak medium rare. It was delicious! My friend ordered the blackened talaptia (fish for Lent) and said it was good. Thanks for a nice evening out, Applebees. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place mike awsome bar tebder, food greate, do recommend u all come and see for ur self"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Lisa K was our server. She was \"bi polar\". She gruffly told me I hadn't asked for ranch when I had. She was slow on getting us our appetizer (which is also the kitchens fault) and drink refills. Finally when I asked her name she than magically started to speed up and also have a better attitude. I know it's hard in the food business. Customer service is VERY important."}
{"text":"All the Applebee's are closing without notice.  This is the 3rd Applebee's we have been to today that wasn't out of business! The biggest complaint is BRING A SWEATSHIRT!! Every Applebee's is always cold.  To the point of uncomfort! Food and drinks are always good and prices are reasonable.  Don't know why they are all closing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food. We ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert and coffee and it was all great.  Tracey, our waitress, was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Just don't.   Really, if you need legitimate reasons I can give you a few. The service is ok which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 but the food is awful. I used to enjoy Applebees and quite honestly I have no idea what happened. Every time I go here I am running to the bathroom 30 minutes later with uncontrollable bowel movements. It's so bad that when someone bought me a gift card here for my birthday, I regifted it."}
{"text":"Bug in our food and managers were very noncarrying and very standoffish regarding this"}
{"text":"This Applebees always has friendly staff.  The price is amazing with the $1 margaritas till the end oof the month and the half price appetizers.  The people and vibe in this Applebees is always upbeat and welcoming.  Two great appetizers to try are the boneless wings and the chicken wontons. If you live in Laveen this is a great place for Happy Hour !"}
{"text":"Today a group of friends and I went to this apple bees location for some drinks and appetizers and had less than satisfactory service. We were seated quickly, but it all went downhill from there. We waited 15 mins before our waiter Elizabeth even noticed that we were there. She took our drink and appetizer order and then we waited a good 15 mins for our 4 drinks to come out and another 15 mins after that to get half our food. Unfortunately she didn't have the greatest memory and tried to hand us all the wrong food. After all this though we still forgave her and we were perfectly fine  until 30 mins later when we still didn't have the rest of the and she had not checked up on us once and never offered to refill our drinks. That lost the company about $15 on drinks that they could have made from us. When we asked her about the rest offood the food she ditzilly replied that she had forgotten and asked us to remind her of our order.  Twenty mins later she brought the rest of the food and still never asked us if we needed refills. We just had to ask for silverware since we didn't have that our entire meal. So cups empty and highly unsatisfied with our waitress she come back to ask if we are just chillen or if we are ready for the checks. We are all in our mid twenties and do not appreciate being talked to like teenagers and ignored by all of the waiters because they are too busy talking amongst themselves to notice any customers. The manager Andrew was called and he apologized and was nice about it and took s few things off. Free stuff doesn't really change the experience, but we appreciated the fact that he tried to make it right. Andrew just needs to have a little more control over his people in the future in order to run a successful business and not lose more sales."}
{"text":"Well I came here on Sunday afternoon to impress my date. I was not impressed, nor was she. First off, she got a salad, and three bites into it realize that there was a hair in it. I would've taken a photograph, but I was far too disgusted to do so. When I show this to the waitress, she offered to replace it with fresh french fries, that would take two minutes. Over 10 minutes later, she brings me my french fries, by then, the burger has gotten cold. Once I finally bite into my burger, the hashbrowns were completely burnt. And the yoke was not runny even though that's the way we asked for it. Then to top it all off as we are leaving, we realize that we are being charge for the salad, the one with the hair in it. I promptly complained, and the hare salad was taken off. But then nothing was done about my burnt hashbrowns on my burger. We paid a lot of money. This is highly unacceptable Applebee's. and I cannot believe that nobody has gotten back to me about this situation"}
{"text":"Two hours, two Altoids, and a vigorous brushing of teeth and I still can't get rid of the taste in my mouth from a single bite of seriously nasty potato soup. The cook could not have tasted it before serving, and we sent it back. My mom and I then shared a chicken piadini and some house chips, which was just ok. That plus two glasses of bad Pepsi and the bill came to over $16. Overpriced and mediocre. Oh, and the employees who had nothing to do sat around the bar joking around loudly."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Applebee's fan, mostly after reading that most of their food is pre-packaged and heated in a microwave. I went yesterday and ordered their ciabatta turkey sandwich with a side of steamed broccoli. The sandwich was big chunks of turkey, which suspiciously looked like what would come in a can. It had no flavor. The broccoli was cold and rubbery. Then I ordered their new salted caramel pretzel sticks for dessert. They tasted nothing like pretzels, more like little doughnuts. The server was very nice, offered to do something about the broccoli, but after a point you just don't care anymore."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but lunch fish and chips with a Pepsi was $16.50. Crazy price for the quality. My real issue was the server, Sari. Very sweet, but two things--(1) she was wearing a very sweet, overpowering perfume, possibly vanilla, which took over the taste and smell of the food; (2) she continually called me sweetie. I absolutely HATE being called sweetie by employees of any establishment. I'm sure she had no ill intent, but it is condescending. Sari is a good server, but management, you have to work on those two issues with her."}
{"text":"Matthew was the best server we could have ask for not only was he super polite, speedy service, wonderful trained, but hands down the most attractive person to walk this planet. Matt from Applebee's could get it any day! Wedding bells are a definite possibility in the near future, and for this reason alone this Applebee's will be the one and only Applebee's that gets my service. This boy deserves a raise!!"}
{"text":"Applebee's always has a nice selection and a variety of items to choose from. As a \"Whachamacallit\" (as my boyfriend would say) they're pretty good at delivering all food items but a master of none. Same goes at this location. Food just fine. Service, however, is lacking. On a very slow afternoon during August with maybe a handful of other people in the restaurant with us... It took our waiter exponentially longer to tend to us than it should've. Let's face it: even if the food is delectable, if I receive crappy service it weighs heavy on my review. Yet again, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We go to this Applebee's all the time! This is like a regular family hangout for us. My kids love the place, and we always try to get Vanessa to wait on us if she's available - she's absolutely the best! Great place to go for good food with the family! I also really like the new items on their menu - and Applebee's keeps on coming up with new items!"}
{"text":"Look, it's Applebee's.  They are in the same vein as TGI Fridays and Olive Garden.  You don't expect or receive gourmet when you say hey, let's go to Applebee's!  It's chain food, the whole family on a tight budget food, secretaries from the office night out food.  But they did it well tonight.  With a gift card from the mother in law we stopped here for dinner.  The service was attentive and accurate, our food would not win any culinary awards but darn it I really enjoyed the sriracha shrimp.  None of the food was cooked improperly and everything was good within the context.  The price was right, I have certainly payed more for less.  Overall a great experience for what it is.  Would I come back without a gift card?  Unlikely.  But they are good at what they do and if all you are looking for is an inexpensive meal from a chain, come here and bring the kids.  They almost lose a star for the birthday song and clapping at the next table over, but again it isn't a place you go expecting your foodie palate to be sated and high brow sensibilities to be appeased.  4 stars for being good at what they do and who they are!"}
{"text":"The Applebee's on J.W. Clay in Charlotte, NC is the most ghetto Applebee's I've ever visited. This morning, the staff and manager allowed a customer to sit at the bar and play his Pandora playlist from his phone on full volume. After several comments to our waiter, the self identified DJ wasn't address nor did his music stop. My group was very disappointed in the lack of leadership displayed in addressing an activity that was impacting the entire restaurant. He played his playlist like a hired DJ and not one employee said anything. It wasn't until I asked whom the manager on duty was that the waiter seemed concerned. It was an hour and 20 minutes too late. I will not be  returning to Applebee's... Friday's is a cross the street."}
{"text":"I got the 6 oz sirloin steak dinner for $9.99.  I always order it midrare...the kitchen actually made my steak to midrare.  The service was good... The baked potato was good and the salad was really great.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Look, it's Applebee's. It's a chain. How great can it be right?  It's actually not bad at all. I only go in for late night dining, mostly for the great specials after 10PM. Many drink specials to choose from including $10 bottles of wine and half off many of their appetizers. I always sit at the bar, but the specials are available in the dining room as well.   My drink of choice is Jack Daniels and Dr. Pepper $7.50. Yes higher than a dive bar but less than a regular restaurant and it's worth every penny. They don't skimp on the Jack, so I always order a tall here.   Sometimes I will order an entree. Steaks are good, burgers are good, salads and soups are all good too.   I really enjoy this location because of the regulars who sit at the bar. Night after night you see the same people, usually stopping by to relax after work. Many are servers at other restaurants. Staff is very friendly and so are the regulars. It's almost like a Phoenix version of Cheers!  Stop by sometime!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I came in with apprehension. I haven't been in, in awhile and was not impressed previously. Our service was great. Allen mentioned the two for $20 and the mac and cheese was amazing."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good tasting food. Lots of TVs and good happy hour drink prices."}
{"text":"Terrible To-Go service! I called twice, no answer so I assumed they were busy, I then decided to order at the restaurant. I waited well over 15 mins for the lady to take my order!  Several ladies asked if I've been helped, and I said \"no\"... Finally someone took my order. After all the wait time, I get home with my order and it's wrong!! I would advise you to check every single item before leaving!  Furious that my request was not followed!! Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Ok. Appetizer of mozzarella sticks were good. Bourbon chicken great. Baby back ribs were cold. Sent it back. Meanwhile, he finished his meal and I was still waiting for mine. Came out hot. Asked server to ask manager for discount. Offered free dessert. Lol hmm. Brownie bite. Literally. A bite. Customer service yuck."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We were seated but no waiter ever showed after 10-12 minute wait.  We asked bartender to change tv channel so we could watch football game which was ok with customers.  He said just a minute but never happened.  This is not first time our service was far below average. Bye bye Applebee's"}
{"text":"Not really bad, not really good either. The waitress was surprised I asked what cuts of steak they had, it so happens they only serve top sirloin, and it's not one of the best cuts, because it's not a marbled steak. Garlic fries were great. Service: Waitress was ok, but she wasn't really attentive or friendly(although she wasn't rude). They need to understand that we as customers don't know the menu, it's their job to be helpful."}
{"text":"I love my Oriental Chicken Salad..sorry I forgot to feature it's beauty for you. So sue me. I got hungry. They forgot to bring out the appetizer but made up for it by taking it off the bill. Greg the waiter was mediocre at best. But the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Niki is an awesome waitress. Make sure you ask for her. Josh the manager is ver pleasant   I will be back and we will ask for Niki. Food was good and restaurant is well lit."}
{"text":"Went out with my wife and the kids last night. Got there around 730 or so. Didn't seem too busy. Walked right in and the hostess was ready and waiting for us and found a nice booth right away. Waitress came by within a few minutes to get our drinks orders. Perfect amount of time. Quick, but not too quick. Enough time to choose what we want. Got our drinks and gave our order. I got the burger with the caramelized jalape√±os.  My daughter got a burger, forget which one, southwest maybe? My son got a corn dog kids meal, and my wife got a trio sampler with the tacos, southwest egg rolls, and something else. Everything was very good and te service was great. I like Applebee's anyway do I will come back."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner around 9pm. My friend and I ordered off the 2 for $25 menu which comes with our choice of entree and shared appetizer. We decided to share the boneless wings. They forgot to bring our side of celery. We both ordered the chicken and shrimp skillet and also noticed the skillet wasn't sizzling.   Both of us were thrown off by that. Our server was all over the place and seemed very overwhelmed as she was pacing back and forth between tables. We observed that she was also training another girl.   Our food wasn't bad but it wasn't hot either which should have been the case because it was on a skillet. Also the potatoes were cold.   We were waiting to pay for a while and then noticed the option to pay via electronic device on the table and chose that route since it was getting late. Our server came over and said she will print our receipt. I left the option on the computer for zero tip because I had cash. I looked over at the server and she looked over at us in disgust assuming we weren't going to leave tip and pre judged us. She then handed the receipt to her trainee and mouthed something to her. The trainee was the one who brung the receipt.  What a way to represent Applebee's with a service like that. I wouldn't want to be trained by someone like the server we had and experienced. Who knows what kind of service you will get"}
{"text":"So, Applebee's is never my choice, but other people seem to like it, so I go with it. Applebee's is what it is and doesn't really seem to try to be anything else.  There's generally a wait at this location around dinner time, and the bar table seating isn't open, it's also part of the wait-list.  You're not going to find complex flavor profiles here, but everything will be familiar, and if you have kids you'll probably find something they'll actually eat.    I do like that they added house salads on the 2 for $20 and 2 for $25 menus instead of having to get a carb loaded/fried appetizer.  Their Happy Hour specials are a pretty good deal too."}
{"text":"So we tried to have dinner there this evening.  The waitress came over to our drink order and brought our drinks as we got our drinks we order our food and then waited over 30 minutes finally our food came all together salads and entree.  Except mine was wrong and I ask for the right entree.  The waitress seem irritated that I just didn't take what she brought me.  So I waited for mine and ask to speak to the manager.  He came over and said they where remaking the food.  NO ONE EVER APOLOGIZED AT ALL.  THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS OUR FAULT.  After an hour and a half I got tired and asked for my check and then I demanded my check and all he could say is he didn't appreciate my cuss word.  I ended up paying $50.00 for lousy service and I didn't even eat.  The management there is a joke.  I will never step foot in that restaurant again and will contact corporate.  I will use social media to get the word out about this place.  ONE STAR IS WAY TO MUCH FOR THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I just finished dinner at this Applebee's. I was alone, and the hostess immediatly took me to the bar area for seating which was exactly where I did NOT want to go, so I had to ask her for a table and she was hesitant and puzzled. My server was pleasant and friendly, and the service was quick.  The wine (Sutter Home Cab) was good.  The water was good.  I ordered double vegetables in lieu of the potatoes, and they were ok (about what you would expect in an Applebee's).  The 12 oz strip steak, however, was not very good.  It was overcooked and somewhat tough.  As a result, I can only rate this visit as \"average\"."}
{"text":"It's the policy of the restaurant to put the wet naps on the plate with the food  That wet nap was in storage after storage where rats piss on the box and then it's put on the plate along with the food disgusting"}
{"text":"Maybe I am too picky with my Fish & Chips.  These ones sucked too!  We keep getting gift cards for this places but I have not had a meal I was happy with here.  The water is good."}
{"text":"I have a serious pork allergy (google it, it's a real thing) I politely explained and asked the lady on the phone to tell the cook about my allergy to make sure my food didn't touch anything with pork. I finished my order and went to hang up. She didn't hang up the phone properly and I heard her tell someone \"idiot says she is allergic to pork, and to not let her precious food touch anything with pork, we don't even have pork!\" When I went in to the restaurant I asked for the lady by name and still being polite explained that they do have pork on their menu. \"No we don't\". Ok how are bacon burgers made? Or  ribs? \"Oh well I wrote a note on the order so you should be fine!\" She hands me the order, and taped to the bag is the order slip. With NO note of my allergy. I asked for the manager and got a similar attitude. If I was a child with a nut allergy I feel I would have been taken seriously."}
{"text":"So ordered drinks an appetizers... then dinner... dunner came 3 minutes after appetizers... my steak was well done... ordered medium. They sent it back... no offer to refire my fiances dinner so we could eat at the same time.... as I watched my fiance finish his dinner they brought my dinner still over done.... I waited over a half hr..... I told them to keep it I was over it.... they said I'm so sorry we didn't charge you for the steak..... really???? R you kiddin me????  Bad service ....."}
{"text":"Chain chain chain, I'm a fool for thinking I would go here for a good meal.  But the menu has much improved.  Surprised by the grilled shrimp and spinach salad, with French dippers at a price not to kill your lunch budget.  Just don't get a pop.  Because pop is now gold.  It always gets me what places charge for pop vs the cost to them.  So its applebees.  I will spare you the d√©cor and style comments.  What makes this one different.  The wait staff is average.  It is usually pretty busy, but you can do the hour lunch."}
{"text":"Very horrible food I order a burger no pink damn cooks didn't listen and was loud and annoying I told gm about it didn't do anything we waited like 40 minutes for your food and I said it was pink took it back and it was still pink worst place ever"}
{"text":"Although I just ordered water and an appetizer, I can't say much about this place food wise. Our server was very nice and fast too. We came in for lunch and was about in about 30 minutes. The hostess greeted us at the door with a smiling face. The appetizer that we ordered were pretzels and it was pretty good. Came with 4 long sticks and there were 2 dipping sauce which was honey mustard and their beer cheese. My favorite was the honey mustard. The beer cheese was alright, a bit on the salty side. Will come back again whenever we need a fast lunch."}
{"text":"Before you order the steak, make sure they have A1. We ordered 3 steak entrees. All of us like A1. Only after serving our meals were we informed there was no A1. Service was friendly but we should have been informed before we ordered. I would have ordered chicken or fish instead. No Bueno. :("}
{"text":"Everytime i come here i leave satisfied. The customer service today was amazing. Like always. I had called in advance and received great customer service over the phone. Then, when i came in, the guys working here (the host, Steve my server and the manager Tommy) tonight were very polite, courteous and knowledgeable of the menu. I really feel like i was at a 5 star restaurant. All it takes is common courtesy and a smile.  I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location a 1 star, for reasons of:  Poor Customer Service.   - Table touching is low. And Table cleaning up is very bad. They'll clean it roughly by 20 mins that the customer is gone. (Which is bad)  - Food service is sooooooo slow. 1 request is taking forever.  - Order wise? Good for 20-30mins waiting time.  - Food? Penne is too dry. So unless u asked for i, then they'll do something about it.    Going back here? Lemme think about it again."}
{"text":"I live by this Applebee's, so time and time again my family and I decide to give it a second chance. However we are ultimately disappointed each time.   The food, for starters, tastes like frozen food that is warmed up again. I order the fish and chips almost each time and the fish tastes like pre frozen fish from Walmart - yuck! Even with their new menu, the food is OK but still tastes like it's been bought at a store and not prepared by a chef. On busy nights, it is impossible to get good service - I once went an entire meal without having my drink refilled. The staff is often ok but if you do not get your servers attention then you will rarely get service.  I feel like this restaurant has potential, but it's just not there yet. Until then, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I write only on the behalf of the amazing services received from Eric, our waiter. Last Saturday I felt like I was his only table of the night and that our family was dining at a 5 star restaurant. He was extremely efficient, thoughtful, organized and funny!!! My family LOVED him!!! Truly we can't say enough great things about his professionalism and hard work!!! Thank you!!   Also, Sandy is our regular girl to see. We missed her deeply that night. She always knows what we need and like  love her!!"}
{"text":"I would describe my experience but considering I wasn't acknowledged by one single employee during the 10 minutes I sat at the hostess stand, I wouldn't say I had much of an experience. They have a promo for unlimited chicken tenders and unlimited rip tips, so it was very busy. I'm from the industry so I completely understand it being busy. But for a hostess to walk right past my family multiple times and not say a single word, that's not terrible service, that's NO SERVICE. I didn't even get bad service because I didn't get any service AT ALL. I wouldn't have minded waiting 15-25 min for a table, but I would rather do it knowing I'm only waiting for that time. I mean come on, we had to leave because my two daughter was crying; she was hungry, go figure! The fact that nobody stepped up and Played the \"that's not my job role\" is atrocious, but the fact that the hostess(who's job it is to TALK to people and seat them) didn't do or say anything is the worst part. As you can see I'm extremely disappointed, rightfully so. I know managers and higher ups read this stuff so get a good look and actually use this to help your store. I don't want other people not being able to eat, including 2 year old children -_- I can't say I'll ever return. It's right down the street from my house, but I'll drive further to actually get service."}
{"text":"It feels dumb to review a place Applebee's because what do you really expect at a low rent chain place? But I think I expected a quick, decent dinner? That was not to be found here.   AC was broken, sweltering in there. They were understaffed and super flaky on service. Two beer taps weren't working. The food sucked. Took several tries to get silverware out of the waitress. Just a mess. Total mess. Never again. Now I know I why this parking lot was empty on a Saturday at prime dinner hour.  Getting the check and paying was a 20 minute ordeal of disappearing waitress.   NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"We were seated as soon as we walked in the door and a waitress appeared immediately with the menu.....she gave us proper time to make our selections...very pleasant and perky young lady.  Our food arrived within a reasonable time BUT the waitress was over attentive and kept coming over to see if everything was alright.  Now this would be a good thing if it weren't over done.  It was annoying because she kept interrupting our conversation.  Too much of a good thing is too much."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my favorite place to frequent. The food is always good, the burgers are great, and the drink specials are tough to be. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came in and was seated really fast but again it was a Monday afternoon. While waiting for our food I politely asked if they can play the winter Olympic since the place was pretty empty. the host was the closest I asked her she said yes and never did change the tv so I asked my waiter and she did notified the manager he did change it and then 15 mins into the show someone turned it off then the manager noticed and he put it back on. After he asked who turned my tv off."}
{"text":"This applebees completely sucks never come here... had to wait 30 minutes just for our appetizer and it came out cold along with our entrees 10 minutes later completely cold and the service is terrible probably the worse restraunt I've ever been to in my life... if I could I'd shut it down myself"}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't ever go to this restaurant. My fianc√© and I thought it would be convenient to order online and do car side pickup. When we arrived to the location, I had to get out to get my food. Not only that but they didn't have some of the food ready. I always already waiting an extra 20 minutes just to get my bag, which they offered no compensation for the additional wait. Upon getting the food, the ribs were burnt; the fries were limp and tasteless; the chicken penne was rubber and not made with penne noodles and the mozzarella sticks were hard. I will never ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I went to an Applebee's several years ago & thought the food was dreadful. I went back today because that's where my son & grandkids wanted to go. The food was even worse than I remembered.  I had the shrimp Thai salad. It was so spicy I couldn't really taste anything.   In fairness, my three grandsons liked their triple bacon burgers & sliders.   They also enjoyed the games they could play on the little monitor at the table.   Bottom line: If you're a kid who judges your food by quantity, this place is OK. If you're an adult who likes food with flavor, skip go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible service ordered a rare steak got it well done ordered a Blue Moon got a Bud light"}
{"text":"What can I see Applebees sucks and so does it's management. Never received a fork. Was delivered too really crappy Bourbon St steaks. Management had zero answers. Spent $17 to not eat dinner and have to go someplace else."}
{"text":"The service is not that great...our server was nice, but very pushy. She kept trying to give us things we didn't want nor ask for...asked for a water 3 times and didn't get it until almost done with my meal.  Going to pay with their little new pay yourself device...took the card from my moms hand...omg people these days!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would rate a chain so highly but their burgers are absolutely delicious!  I got the Standard, stuffed with bacon, pickle and onions cooked 'pink' (not rare or well-done; just right). Super juicy on a perfectly toasted bun. I would have ate 2 if my stomach had room. Fries were good and french onion soup is above average. I would give 5 stars but they were short staffed and drink refills were hard to come by and they forgot our soup so it came with the meal instead of before which we made sure to request to avoid that. Despite that small inconvenience, the burgers made up for it. Staff was very nice despite being stretched too thin. Get the burger!"}
{"text":"What is there to say its Applebees. Food is generally reasonably priced but decent tasting at best. Its convenient for an easy bite. This location is clean and usually has pretty good service."}
{"text":"Its hard to find the right words to talk about Applebee's  because the reality of it is that ITS APPLEBEES!!! You don't come here looking for culinary masterpieces. Hell, half the time we dont even come here for the food!  But.. when  you pack in some friends.. a couple cocktails and the spinach dip.. it cant be beat.   The service here is usually adequate... The food is usually adequate... The atmosphere is adequate...  For a quick bite to eat... its ok !"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We were a large party and I understand that there is a reasonable wait time but they need to give a good and honest estimate of wait time not just keep saying \"soon\". We waited an hour at first they told us just 30mins and we kept asking them and they would say oh just ten minutes. Not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. An hour and we hadn't even ordered our food. Never got silverware. Had to go look for the server to pay for the appetizer and pops that had been long gone before we finally gave up and decided to leave. I don't mind paying but dang we totally wasted our time with very little sympathy and no offer to make it right. Very disappointed. Not acceptable in food service I'd say."}
{"text":"I placed an order for pick up, the food wasn't ready (even though I was running late to get it). The bartender told us it was because they were waiting for fresh fries. The fries didn't seem hot and fresh, my boyfriend ordered the all day brunch burger with an extra beef patty, he said it was great. My sandwich on the other hand was such a disappointment. I ordered the kickin turkey stacker, one slice of bread was soggy the other was so dry and toasted it turned to dust. All it was was turkey, major melted cheese, and slaw. It was supposed to have a sriracha Chile lime sauce on it which was NO WHERE to be found! The sandwich had no flavor! And the sweet potato fries were nothing to rave about either."}
{"text":"I love this place, relaxed ambiance and good food. It's right next to our apartment, my hbd and I often stop by late in the evening after a long work day. I love their house salad  with the Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp, Yummy."}
{"text":"I have come here numerous times with friends and have never encountered a problem.  Except seeing how rude some of the people are to the staff! The food is good and the servers have always been great to us. Never a problem getting seated or collecting our bill. We even have a favorite waiter (Waters) now who greets us with a hug. The food is good for the price. The restrooms are clean and parking is never a problem. It's Applebee's but it fits the budget!"}
{"text":"First, of all where do I start....hahaha the server took forever to greet us. When I ordered my drink, I said I didn't like it and got another one. She took 5 to 8 mins to get me my drink. Her customer service skills suck and they seemed too occupied to pay attention to anything you do. I can tell you one thing I don't come here for the customer service it's horrible. The food was not that great and the service was slow and disappointing. Then offer me a $50 dollar gift card on top of that haha what a joke if I spent $50 or something. I regret coming here and won't be ever coming back. Horrible service, no wonder most of them closed down in California from where I am from because they suck compared to other restaurants. I'm not happy and wasted $45. Don't come here ever. On top of that the walls and tables were covered with ANTS....how gross! This is a gross place to eat and unhealthy."}
{"text":"We've had our ups and downs with them I would call myself a regular customer, so we can go frequently the service staff is nice the food is good if there's ever mistakes they're happy to fix it, I go every year for my birthday thanks!!! I will be there every year to make me feel a year younger each time."}
{"text":"Applebee's has changed their menu since I have been last and a lot of it looks really yummy!! I had their chicken won ton tacos, you get 4 little tacos for $5.99 and they also have pulled pork. They were sooo good!! This was a take out order, so I can not comment on the service in the restaurant. Maybe I will visit them more often.  You can also get delivery for Applebee's from You Buy and We Fly food delivery service!!"}
{"text":"I don't remember what I wrote before but it has been years since I have been here. I remember kind of that Applebee's suckered for some reason. But I have been seeing commercials on TV for them and it looked good. Funny thing is I did not get what I saw on TV. It tasted good, the spinach chicken I got. Nothing to write home about. The waiters Trace was super nice."}
{"text":"Are waiter is great but the food was just so so and the plate is dirty has a oil film on it .. A bit disappointed"}
{"text":"This was not my first visit here but this trip was annoying. I use carside service on most visits. I usually wait about 3-5 minutes before someone comes out but I can see them acknowledging my existence and getting my food. This time I sat for 10 minutes and saw no one checking outside (it's dark and my headlights shine right in the door). The manager even came out the carside door as I was getting out of my car and kept walking to the back of the building. Alrighty. After asking the hostess if carside service was available she went to ask about my food. The manager came back with it. Yes. The same one who saw me get out of my car. He told me my total, walked away with my card and offered no apology or acknowledgement that anything was wrong. I left angrier at the whole place and thinking that maybe I just don't understand how carside service is supposed to work. And my husbands chicken was dry when I got it home.  It's not that I'm lazy. I'm not. But if I'm not prepared to go into a restaurant, my attire might reflect those of pajamas and it's annoying to be put in that situation with no remorse from the staff."}
{"text":"Just okay.  My boyfriend and I went to get out of the house and decided they might have some decent happy hour specials on food and drinks.  Their happy hour was pretty good, so we got a few things- the mozzarella sticks and the chicken wonton tacos, and I also got a side salad and he got a side Caesar salad.  The salad was lettuce, tomatoes, and a mountain of croutons. The ranch dressing was not great, straight out of a container.  He said his Caesar salad was okay, but the dressing was the same kind of blah.  I did not care for the chicken tacos, they were bland and heavy handed with a tropical type cole slaw. He said they weren't bad so he had most of those.  The cheese sticks were the same- blah with bland marinara sauce.  Applebee's is always that place you go so everyone can find something to eat because they have a good variety of foods, but I always leave disappointed because the food is boring and nothing tastes homemade. Save this restaurant for the occasional lunch you have with your grandma.   Also, the restaurant was very dim and felt like they were trying to save on their electricity bill or something! I will say our waiter was very nice and on top of everything, making the customer service side of the experience a positive for sure."}
{"text":"Great service ! Our server Misty was very nice and friendly. Definitely will come back. The food was great to I always end up getting the combo sampler thing"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Waitress was very friendly and helpful. However the manager or the general manager is totally and completely worthless!! He cared more about the patrons in the bar then he did about a problem I had with my food! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy! Do yourself a favor avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Service by Alyse was great but the food was very disappointing..sandwich was clumped in the middle and wasn't at all what i expected"}
{"text":"No, thanks.  I can't help but think of Office Space's \"Chotchke's and their pieces of flair every time I get sucked into going to Applebee's. The poor wait staff.   And the food is just not good. It could be just an unfortunate coibncidence that of the seven or eight things I have tried they have all failed to impress me but somehow I doubt it.   I don't like TGI Friday's very much, but of the two comparable restaurants, I much prefer it to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Food was slow and after receiving it, the food was cold in places and overcooked in others.  There was no ketchup in the bottle at all at the table.  We mentioned this to the waitress who switched out the bottle with another table.  So now whoever sits at the other table gets empty bottle.  Awful.  Waste of money and reminded me why I don't like Applebee's."}
{"text":"Had a nice time with the family and we all enjoyed our meals. Waiter was very friendly and attentive.  The next morning I went into my wallet and my credit card wasn't there. I knew I left it at Applebee's so I called them and they had it waiting for me.  Thank you Applebee's for a nice family dining experience and for your integrity in returning my credit card!!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. Food was average. Tables were sticky. Dishes dirty. I was not happy. Complained to manager. She gave me my limeade free of charge. I won't be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Got the 2/$25 deal. Spinach artichoke dip for the appetizer. It was good though usually the portions are a good size bigger. I got the bourbon street steak with grilled red potatoes and onions, ordered medium. My adult daughter got the baby back ribs with honey bbq sauce, fries, and cole slaw.  The steak was overdone. Not tender and sort of dry. The red potatoes were dry and tasteless. And the onions were only partially cooked, not at all caramelized.  The ribs had good flavor but we're really dry and the sauce was pasty.  The fries were perfect. The cole slaw fairly decent.  We had planned on ordering brownie bites, but the server didn't ask us, she just brought a check. (Faster than she brought our refills. Which she only did when we flagged her down after multiple passes.)  I recommend a different Applebee's location. The one on Baseline and Gilbert in Mesa (near Trader Joes) is a much nicer establishment, better service and perfect food."}
{"text":"We stopped off for a drink here on our way out to other things.  She had a strawberry daquiri which wasn't bad at all.  I was inspired to drink something fruity and ended up drinking a strawberry pina colada which was terrible.  I don't know what I was thinking.  The Pina Colada song started playing in my head and I felt compelled.  Rest assured it's a compulsion I will be able to resist until I'm on a beach in the Bahamas.  Which will be like, never since I'm not a big tropical beach person.  Big D had a martini and said it wasn't so great.  A wave of whimsey crashed against the rocks of my disappointment (or perhaps chunks of ice) in my pina colada, and I had a craving for broccoli cheese soup.  It was edible, but nothing spectacular.  I think I'm too hard on such things.  Cheese soups aren't easy to get right I suppose, because it seems to fall below my expectations at most places, but when they get it right I am in cheese laden nirvana.  The only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 was that the service was excellent.  Our server was always checking in with us, asking about drink refills, talked with us about menu items - in an informative and non-pushy way - answering all of our questions and making conversation rather than suggestive selling.  She was just very attentive and very nice which always makes me happy."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of this location. The wait was about 30-40 minutes which is expected for a Saturday night. After we were finally seated, it felt like the chairs were ready to break from under us. They were extremely wobbly and frail. Our server was nice enough and she was attentive. It took a while to get our food. I ordered the Brewhouse chicken (I think that's what it was called). It was alright but it didn't wow me. The presentation of the food was sort of sloppy. My friend ordered the enchilada platter. His rice was extremely dry and had no flavor at all. He asked for a replacement and the waitress brought it no problem and he said it was much better. Overall, the service was alright but the food, not so much. I would have rather gone to Chili's."}
{"text":"We went on. Saturday night, we were seated efficiently and semi quickly. We ordered and our waitress was so nice, she was from Michigan a d very quick to get us our drinks and order in . All seemed well. We receive our food, my mother recie ved a burning hot skillet which was awesome I recieved my food the chicken cedar plank. (Chicken tasted like the frozen patties you get from the freezer section in walmart) but flavor was okay. My boyfriend however recieved his burger in the there at plate I have ever seen (see pictures) we first thought oh it's just scratches, however we can wipe the dirty soot off with a slight bit of pressure. We brought this up to the waitress and she said that \"is just the way our plates are\" the manager Frank came over and reiterated that's just how these plates are .umm!!!! clean them before you put food in it period . Ugh won't be going back thats so nasty!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted the pretzel sticks and I didn't order them - LOL  MY French onion soup was delicious, my salad was crisp and my meal was good. Best mashed potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant - I wanted the baked potato, but they were out !  My husband thought all of his food was just ok  All in all, we enjoyed our meals but we were FLOORED when we got the bill! It was outrageous! We could have had a full steak dinner for what we paid. So NOT worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress had way too many tables. Other employees were useless. It took FOREVER to get simple food. Soup was partially frozen. All the other food was cold. The table was so wobbly that the soup ended up spilling everywhere so that didn't matter anyway. Poor waitress actually paid for our soup. Disgusting. Bad environment. DO NOT GO HERE AND DEFINITELY DO NOT BRING KIDS!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I walked into this place and the country music was blasting. Like really blasting. Initially we laughed it off but then it was country song after country after country song. It was like they had it on a loop. My sister noticed the \"jukebox\" and went to add some variety. She'd been standing there for over five minutes before the bartender told her she'd have to download the app on her phone. She came back to our table and did so. As she's looking through the song/artist options she realizes all the hip hop songs/artists were unavailable. When the waitress came around we asked about it. Her response was, \"Oh I don't know. Probably because the language is inappropriate.\" We let her know that most artist's have edited versions for such venues. She just said, \"Well I just don't know!\", and walked away. Soon after the country music changed to 60's classics like The Supreme's and Diana Ross. Such a coincidence!"}
{"text":"We had been working all day and decided to go to Applebees cuz it was the closest restaurant candidly. It was a Friday night and we got there around 8PM and had a 10 minute wait for a table.  Once Seated we were greeted by our server who was great. He took super care of us all night and never let any of our drinks get too low.  For dinner we ordered the Bourbon chicken and Shrimp and the Salmon for the wife, both were actually cooked just perfectly which was actually a surprise as so many chains will overcook chicken and fish but both of our entrees were done perfectly.  This place was clean and the service was superb...........just wish were werent watching our calories right now as the desserts looked great going by!!"}
{"text":"Apple Bees is not what it used to be,  because of that, that's the  reason why Don't  eat there a lot. Yes they had deals BUT some the food is not that cheap.The have the 2 for $20 (one app and 2 meals). I had the  shrimp wu tag stir fry, it was $10.99 they shrimp was cooked prefect and not over cooked. It had really good flavor."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this apple bees for years! Today we got the best service we have gotten in a while. Even while dealing with a stubborn family next to us Javie came with a smile to make sure we were doing alright. We appreciate it! Food and dessert were great! Hope we get him as a server next time!"}
{"text":"It's an Applebee's...what do you expect?  Every Applebee's I've ever been to has sticky tables...must be something in how they are made or cleaned.  The shot glass desserts aren't bad, but if you go here, you know what you are getting in to."}
{"text":"I gave them 1 star because I couldn't give a negative star. The restaurant was empty, and it took almost an hour for the waiter to come. Then when they did come, it took over an hour for our food to come. It gets worst, the waiter brought everyone's food out, but forgot to put one of orders in to the kitchen. The last meal didn't come until everyone was done eating. When I asked for the manager, it took 30 more minutes for him to show as well. They gave us a discount for the mishap. Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had at an Applebees, I will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Toni is the BEST waitress.  We only ask for her!  Best service EVER!  We go there for lunch.  Make sure to ask for the French onion soup well done so the cheese melts completely.  Otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"My chicken was burnt, the side that was black was facing down to hide it! I sent it back and ordered a rare steak. It came out  well done and full of gristle. Their idea of making amends, was to ONLY charge for the burnt chicken, but took off the steak! Unbelievable! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Applebee's is nothing speical. I ordered their Bacon Burger and was asked if I wanted it pink or not pink. Generally I like Medium rare, but they don't do that. I choose Pink and got a 'well done' probably Mircowaved burger that seemed to have semi burnt burger flakes from a previous burger. The person I was with also had aburger the results were the same. The fries were fine and the waitress did a fine job. But like most experences at big chains, I end up leaving full yet unimpressed"}
{"text":"Went to Applebee's for lunch.  We tried the lunch specials.  We both had the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey chicken.  I had a salad with mine and my husband had the club sandwich.  We were both disappointed with both.  The mac and cheese was just weird with some sort of chicken pieces and my salad was just a bunch of lettuce with a little bit of parm shaved on top with very little dressing.  My husband said his sandwich was nothing special."}
{"text":"What a joke! There were barely any patrons dining when we arrived, we were sat, and no one bothered to come back to check on us again... it's not like we were seated in a back corner,  we were in the middle of the room!!!   I make a comment to the bartender that no one has taken our drink orders yet..... I might as well have been invisible. After 14min and no one still has acknowledged our table, we just left... and ate at Chili's. Won't return here ever!"}
{"text":"The food and service is good. If not, they usually take care of it. Bathrooms are gross and it's usually pretty busy but overall decent place to eat out with great HH."}
{"text":"Rocky, the bartender, is amazing EVEN though she is being a pussy wimp about her softball injury. 5 stars would recommend."}
{"text":"Omg! Amazing pizza! Amazing service, thanks Amanda! And great prices! I'll be back and I'm only in town for 3 days!"}
{"text":"Samo samo chain food stalls... Couldnt be any better people? Always the same crappy food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and I missed my other Applebee's for lunch soup and salad so thought I would try this one out and thankfully it was just as awesome ! Went in just one time bartender Catherine remembered my name and drink and the manager Kathy was also very friendly ! Good place for a relaxing stop in for lunch ."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 star simply because if it wasn't for the server working the tables around the bar actually listening to me and helping me this place would get a zero. The bar tender sucks. She's not intuitive to all her customers. She defiantly has her regulars that she tends to more. But let's face it. Regulars around the ages of 21-25 don't tip well. She never asked me how my meal was but that one waiter has actually attended to me more by just walking around this u shape bar. I came in to eat dinner and drink a hot tatee cause I don't feel good and this is the service I receive. I'm an out of towner to. And get this she never carded me. I always get carded cause I look like I'm 20. Yeah so what I'm 30. I ALWAYS get carded. And this woman doesn't even know me. I even had to grab pepper off of another table. The no meat no chz salad that I ordered too was so ice cold. The plate was even ice. It hurt my teeth eating it. My mouth was frozen. I took only two bites and had brain freeze thereafter. After a long day of work to this. Sorry Applebee's get it together. Back home our Applebee's is the shit. This place has great servers but a damn horrible bartender. She will not be tipped for she didn't wait on me. Noah is getting my tip and should be the bar tender cause he is way more personable."}
{"text":"Why, why, why...do I subject myself to this place?!?!  There are times when I don't mind a chain food experience and I've had positive experiences at Applebee's before, but overall I think the bad experiences override the good ones.    So on to my most recent experience at Apps.  I ordered the sirloin with shrimp that my mother and I were planning on sharing.  I need my meat cooked so I asked for medium well.    The entree came out and I was cutting it in half to give a portion to my mom when my steak knife wouldn't really cut through the meat.  I thought it was weird until I saw that there was one millimeter (no joke) of the meat cooked and I was basically cutting raw meat.    It was disgusting, especially for someone who is really picky about meat.  And it was also super annoying b/c it was done rare, not even medium, but rare.  I think I may have been able to let it slide if it was at least medium.  So needless to say when the server came back I told her that it wasn't cooked properly.  She said that she'd tell them to put it back on the grill.  Ummm...no thanks.  The only thing that may be equally horrible as having your meat undercooked is having it thrown back on the grill so that when it's returned you're eating an animal chew toy at that point.    So asked our waitress if I can order something else.  She was nice about it, but I could sense she was annoyed.  But I'm the one who suffers b/c I'm waiting around for the new order to come out while everyone else is chomping down on their food.  I should mention that I was really hungry b/c it was after work and I hadn't eaten since lunch.    Anyhoo - I'll be thinking twice before going to Applebee's."}
{"text":"I've been here before, an it's the last time. I have a gluten allergy and each time I come in, it seems to be an issue. Not sure if it's the wait staff, the cooks or management that are not educated, but they've lost this customer for sure. I won't be back."}
{"text":"So I went here this weekend with my family and my in laws. It was Saturday and they were pretty quiet to tell the truth.  We had a sweet waitress but she kept trying to upsell and it sounded so scripted and honestly it was pretty annoying after the thirds time. MY father in law fell for it though and ordered an appetizer.  Overall the food was ok, it was pretty hot. My hubby ordered a side salad and it was so small, it was like a handful of lettuce, He said his potatoes and veggies were so salty he didn't eat much. I had  sliders and fries, the fries were nice and crispy, but overall it was just ok.  Its not a place I would choose to eat out, but its ok in a pinch...."}
{"text":"We went here last night, something we do about twice a year.  I've generally been pleased with the food I get and that stayed the same last night.   I started with a cup of the broccoli and cheese soup.  It was very thick and very tasty.  For the main course, I had their new Sizzling Cajun Steak and Shrimp.  It was a 7 ounce steak topped with blackened shrimp and Cajun gumbo.  The rub on the steak gave it some zing and the gumbo had some spiciness too.  The shrimp were not blackened, but they were good.  As for the gumbo, it was very tasty but I would have liked to have more than one piece of okra.  Service was very good.  Arnold, our server, was quick and coming to the table to take our order, and he was on top of iced tea refills.    My only complaint was when the music was turned on, it was terribly loud, making a conversation impossible.  I had to almost yell to be heard just across the table."}
{"text":"I will not order from this applebees again. I got carside to go & was told it would be a 20 min wait however I waited 50 mins. I finally called & they said that they were still working on my order. Finally my order comes out & the guy said that he didn't bother to look at the parking spot I was in.. even tho it was a carside parking spot? Then as he hands me my food, there was ranch spilt all inside the bag. A complete mess. Probably because they put a lid on that was way too big for the container. To top it all off, my boneless wings were completely cold and undercooked. Super awful ."}
{"text":"My Wife and I used to go to this restaurant , however after the last visit, it took twenty plus minutes to get the entrees. The appetizer that  we had ordered had not arrived  The server went looking and returned, It was cold When asked about this  we were ignored from that point. we got another server, who was just as lackadaisical we also asked for a manager, and never had any response  In all we will not return to this Applebees, and all other restaurants from this company are off my list"}
{"text":"Host was funny and personable, waitress initially dished on the trials n tribs of the \"$1 Long Island iced tea\" special of the month- the fact that The special negates some tip amounts in most cases \"especially in Lorain County\". While true were in a depressed county of alcoholics- the job entails working for tips unfortunately in this country and complaining about low tips is not going to charm many people into increased pity tips. Afterwards for some reason she seemed to be offended and /or expecting a larger tip based on previous spilled tea about the special and neglected basic wait skills such as timely delivery of food and refills, and even fudged the order several times. Food was meh- mozz stix were cold n solid, chips for the choke dip were stale and greasy tho that's how my partner likes em...Drinks were cheap n strong, as expected and overall experience was as to be expected, as it is Applebee's. Relatively decent, tho disappointing, in humankind if nothing else. Take care  Came back 9 days later, waiter again got tude about the $1 LITs, look- a waiter can't just assume they're gonna get low tips bc of the total bill; but one can assume the tips are not going to be great based on poor service. This is a hospitality line of work. Booooo also the drinks were heavy on the mix"}
{"text":"Generous portions of delicious food.  I almost licked my plate and the desert was out of this world too!   The service was friendly.  I would not say that it was bad service but they do give you some space.  When we needed someone they were always there.  I took off one star because the credit card machine has a % minimum of 15% tip and they charge tip on tax too.  I'm pretty sure that is something that they can tweak.  Next time I will choose a dollar amount for my tip."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and very helpful. We ordered the cheese burger egg rolls. They very good. We also had the tortilla soup very good also. I found this Applebee's to be clean which is very important to me. My only problem was we wanted to pay in cash and had to seek out our waitress. They have a tablet on every table to pay with a credit card. I guess with these tablets it's the only way to go."}
{"text":"First time in a long time that we've eaten here. Was not happy, I had shrimp scampi fettuccini, there was 5 or 6 small shrimp and a lot of pasta, no bread or salad included price $13.99. My husband had brisket enchiladas, he rated as just ok."}
{"text":"Well...  What can you say?  This place does ok for what it is supposed to do.   Applebee's has made a lot of sacrifices lately as a company and the menu just continues to slide south.    This location has mixed service.   We have been here twice and the first time it was pretty crazy bad.   The next time it was great.     None of that changed the food.   For what you pay, you are getting cafeteria food.   To that end, you are probably paying too much.     I hope Applebee's figures it out someday."}
{"text":"Not a good Applebee's at all. My food is never right and always has to be sent back. Don't order a burger as it will be overcooked. The waitresses are simply annoying and incompetent to get orders right. I wish this was good as it is right down the street."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service. I enjoyed my last few visits here. I will definitely return here in the future. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"The food was delicious as always. The customer service was good very attentive to when ever I needed anything. The only negative thing I can take from my time at Applebees was my poop consistency was not as it should be. It was a lot harder than it should have been, but let's not ruin the whole experience."}
{"text":"I have always valued Applebee's, price wise and quality. We ordered their nachos with pulled pork or brisket, we had to go with brisket of course! The picture looked great, nice size pieces of brisket per 3 to 4 chips. What we got was a liquid with chunks of meat in it, maybe a chunk per 10 chips. I asked if they had forgot the brisket and she said she could bring out more if I liked... I liked. So she brings out this plastic cup the size of a jello cup with this liquid in it. Then went on to say that the the cooks usually put 4 to 5 of these on but since the regional manager was there that they had to go by the book and put on 2.  So congratulations Applebee's, if this is how you run your company you just lost a customer. I am not a fan of false advertisement!"}
{"text":"I try not to expect much out of chain restaurants, and I'm not particularly a fan of any Applebee's, but this location just sucks. We came here because it's cheap and they have basic menu items to accommodate some of the pickier members in our party of 6. The hostess' make it clear that they hate their jobs. No smile. No sense of humor. Just cold miserable stares.  For an appetizer we ordered 2 orders of Mozzarella Sticks that came too cold on the inside. It was like eating a string cheese fresh out of the fridge.  It took 46 minutes for our main course to arrive. 46 minutes to make 3 steaks, 1 sandwich, a bowl of French Onion soup, and a burger. My rare steak came well done. My boyfriends food (which was just a turkey sandwich and fries) didn't come at all. Everyone else's food was cold, including our grandpas soup.  Not the first time I've had an experience like this. Not a fan."}
{"text":"First off. Latic a terrible waitress on three different occasions she would service the table next to us and would completely walk away from us.   I'm sitting next to a pile of dirty dishes that have been here for ten minutes and three servers and a host have walked past. My boyfriend food came out wrong and did our server latrece even say anything about it. Or speak to us. No. She simply told the food runner that it wasn't wrong but two mins later the food runner comes over takes me boyfriends food and doesn't say anything.  Asking for a knife from two different people took over 5 mins.   The manager John came over. Overall impression is not impressed. Just didn't look put together. I'm clearly bussing my own table and all he says is oh we gotta get these guys up to par.   Has the waitress said anything to us yet. No.   Even as we are leaving the waitress doesnt say a word to us :("}
{"text":"Been sitting here for 15 minutes with an empty cup because our waitress hasn't checked on us once. Mind you there's only 4 tables that have people, the place is dead. Food is horrible, I am sending it back and yet there's no one here to come take it back. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Applebee's food and overall quality has improved so much over the past couple years! I went here about a week ago for the first time in about three years and it completely changed my opinion of the chain restaurant. They had a much better selection and quality of food items. There prices were reasonable. The atmosphere and setting was appropriate, and the staff was polite. They have a large parking lot, and many seats in the sitting areas, so their is usually not a wait (when I've been there). The bar area also looked wonderful with a large drink menu. I would recommend Applebees after this experience."}
{"text":"Mike the bartender is great. So friendly and personable. Food is good just like any other Apple bees but the service at this location is great"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience with this place! We've eaten at Applebees in the past and have never been let down; however, up until now, we had always dined at the restaurant. This time, we decided to try something new so we placed our order online. As you can imagine, ordering online turned out to be a very simple process. We got to pick specifically what we wanted with each meal and appetizer. For example, I ordered a burger so I got to specify how I wanted it cooked, what toppings (including sauces and type of cheese), and I even got to specify that I wanted my fries seasoned with garlic. We then set the time for when we wanted the food to be ready.  At the specified time, we drove to the restaurant and parked in the space designated for car-side pick-up. Within minutes, a very polite gentleman approached us and asked to confirm our order. Soon afterwards, he brought us our food, which smelled absolutely wonderful on the ride home.  The food was terrific. My burger was just fantastic. It was made exactly as I had ordered. My wife had the chicken tenders (which I sampled) and those were awesome too. We also got the boneless barbecue wings, which also rocked.   I can't wait to have Applebees again!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and food not so good. Had the soup and Cesar salad-it was basically a plate of iceberg lettuce with Parmesan cheese, a few croutons with a little dressing. Soup was not hot (barely warm). Everyone else's food was marginal for the cost. Was never offered a refill-considering the cost of a glass of tea and soda would have been nice.  The couple at the table behind us left right when their drinks came. Wish I was smart enough to have done that as well."}
{"text":"I've been to several Applebee's and this one is the worst, the service is horrible as a matter fact no service I walked inside their waited 15 minutes and nobody ever came to even give me a glass of water!!! Bad bad management!!!"}
{"text":"I went there two times lately, and I didn't like it. First, they removed the Rip Eye steak from their menu. The menu became smaller and has less options!  Their new steak is not tasty at all. I ordered it \"medium well\" and it was not juicy at all. I definitely would go to Texas Roadhouse instead."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!  If 0 star was an option, it would have been selected... I suppose the 1 star is given simply for our servers kindness, he was kind and he did try... but it was clear he had little to NO training...  We waited at least 15-20 for our drinks, and probably 30 mins. for our appetizer...  Which wouldn't have been a huge deal besides the fact the entire place was DEAD... besides us there may have been 4 other tables sat.  Overall the restaurant was gross, it was obvious they did little to no cleaning/sanitation.  But most importantly the food was disgusting, I ordered the sirloin... 6oz, which it wasn't...  the taste was so terrible I couldn't eat it.  I ordered the steak medium, yet it was well WELL done... burnt to a crisp. I asked for sauce, which took another 10 mins. Even the steak sauce couldn't cover the disgusting taste... my fries were also burnt, and the broccoli was horrible, too!  We ordered a kids meal (corn dog,) and requested that it come out first... yet 15 mins after receiving our food the corn dog was still no where to be seen, so we canceled the order.  Over all, it was just a incredibly terrible experience and we will NEVER BE BACK..."}
{"text":"I find Applebee's to generally be inconsistent.  The food is ok. Typically heavily salted and a bit overdone. Sometimes it'll be better, it's just rare.  The waitstaff at this location turns over a lot due to the campus nature of waitstaff in Champaign Urbana. Your experience will likely vary here.  If you're a fan of Applebee's in general this will probably suffice."}
{"text":"This location gets worse every time I go... they are always busy so a wait is expected but having to wave the wait staff down is ridiculous and the portion size was like horrifically small so sad when this was one of my top three go to restaurants and now I won't be back oh ya one more thing we never got refills thru the entire meal for drinks until just before she brought the check"}
{"text":"Wegives this place a four. \"You got some bomb chicken\" says my date. \"And I like your fries, I just don't understand why you would not have fries and chicken in the same order. That is really unfair\" She continued on with other complaints. But then she concluded they, the fries and chicken were both amazing. The fries had their signature seasoning and the boneless wings  dipped in buffalo sauce ultimately made her become a fan. Those electronic order machines were probably a hefty investment for the company but we think unnecessary. Definitely will be back to try more options on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few Saturdays in the past couple months, Clara is a super star. She knows what I want for a drink before I sit down. She's friendly and attentive to everyone. The food has been great also."}
{"text":"Don't go stay away worst experience have had not worth the frustration.they must need a recipe to make water doesn't anyone bus dirty dishes any more"}
{"text":"So excited to visit one of my favorite places and I have officially been let down again. Not by the food but by the service. While waiting 15 minutes to even order drinks at a time where it isn't that busy we were barley acknowledged. When we were approached by what  I believe to be the manager she was nice enough and we ordered everything at that point.  When our server finally approached us her attitude was OK until we told her we already  put our order in. From there she walks off and groups together with two other younger girls who then turn to look at my table. Just not very professional. Food comes and there are things wrong but we hate to complain so we just proceeded to eat. Food actually was really good they just forgot the bacon on the all-in burger. Not a big deal. I asked for more oriental dressing cause it's awesome and when she brought it back she tosses on table and says here you go girl. At that point I decided she will not receive a tip from me. She was short and rude even though I maintained being a lady I was offended. I am in the service industry dealing with hair which you get all types of clients and situations that challenge your character. It's what you do in those situations that determine your moral fiber."}
{"text":"I have to say we found our food to be really good an the service was excellent . Our server's name was Sunshine an she looked after us great. When it was time to watch the Flames /Oilers game the manager bought us a little speaker to listen to the game . So the rest of the lounge could listen to the music . Thku for a lovely evening ."}
{"text":"Waitress nice food ok... but went to the restroom to wash my hands and clean out my mouth..something in the water super salty told the manager and she mentioned a water line issue and just walks away only the waitress apologized...not going back.."}
{"text":"Top of the line service beginning to end door held opened food awesome management an active part of our experience our server was james... thanks guys"}
{"text":"Food was great service was horrible. .. Waitress \"C\" was just slacking. .. food served not correctly. .. food all over her uniform ... no utensils. . At least food was good"}
{"text":"Not giving 5 stars for the price but the food was so good and the steaks just melted in my mouth. And the service was exceptional in a time when servers tend to not care."}
{"text":"Typically I love Applebee's. My team & I always stop when we go on tournament trips. It's become a staple for us. But stopping here after a long day, I got my food to go because I didn't have an appetite yet. I was given my order before leaving, all packaged and wrapped up. After a six hour drive I got home and went to eat since I was ravenous at this point, only to find out they had given me the complete wrong entree. I couldn't eat it because I'm unable to eat spicy foods and of course it ended up being something spicy. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed over a meal before. Yes, I could've checked it, but we were anxious to get home and I trusted they had the right order. Not to mention, it was all packaged up. I definitely will not be returning to any Applebee's in the near future. Let alone this location."}
{"text":"the last two times my boyfriend and I went to applebee's, I got really bad stomach cramps. I thought it may have been what I ordered. this time around, I ordered something else and I got really bad stomach cramps as well. different Applebee's, same outcome. the food is awesome, though!"}
{"text":"Quickies: Food: 2 stars // Service: 3 stars // Price: 4 stars.  I came here on a Sunday Brunch this past weekend.  I met up with a couple friends who lived in the area and rather than stick with what I knew I left it up to our server.  Wrong choice.  The restaurant as a whole was clean and decorated like all the other Applebees.  It was steady and not overly busy which was nice.  When  the server came I asked him which of the margaritas he recommended for that Sunday and he told me the perfect margarita.  I could barely taste the alcohol in it, it was more sweet and sour than tequila.    Next I asked which of the entree he recommends, the new Shrimp Jambalaya.  Ordered.  While waiting and conversing with good friends I drank my lemonade and didn't want to order another tequila but I stuck with Blue Moon.    Jambalaya came!  Maybe I'm basing the taste to some really good jambalaya and so my standards were already high.  To put it plainly:  Tasted like it was lesser than a microwave jambalaya dinner.  It was bad, the pasta stuck together.  No kick in the taste.  Tasted bland.  The peppers being in it were out of touch and didn't blend well.  And where was the main topping of the jambalaya?  The shrimp?!  So come to find out our server who recommended the dish has never tasted it before.  =(    So if I had not mixed my dish and the ingredients around, it wouldn't have looked like I touched it.  And the other person who ordered the same thing agreed about the taste.  I asked for a simple burger.  I won't let one bad dish lower the rating but I feel 3 stars is more than adequate at this time."}
{"text":"The location is at a nice spot along Stephanie and Sunset, head south from that intersection if you can't spot it right away.  Ate here before a show at the Smith Center because we're so fancy.  Food was okay, wine was excellent, service wasn't the best but you can tell she's new and working for her kids (pictures in her ticket book) so I hooked her up with tip equal to half our $44 check.  I ordered the signature sirloin with garlic herb shrimp.  It was cooked medium rare but you can tell the quality of the meat isn't that on top for sirloin cuts.  And the shrimp was cooked with lots of grease from the same pan."}
{"text":"Love the place, the food, great service. Thanks maria for the attention we had so much fun all the girls love the food you recommend... the staff attention is very polite as always, we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR, the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. I have been to Applebee's food chains across the country and this one is the WORST ONE. Whatever you do, DO NOT come here. They should fire all the waitors/waitresses and have a whole new crew come in. Unless Chef Robert Irvine and the crew on Restaurant: Impossible come in and fix this place up, it should close down."}
{"text":"I know we entered the business in April but it might have actually been snowing inside. I think I actually saw a polar bear! I actually went to my car and got a sweater-no kidding! Several people were complaining about the sub-zero temps so the manager adjusted it. Even that didn't help do she actually turned the AC off. The food was good, as usual, but the iced tea was tough. No amount of sugar improved the stale taste even slightly. The chimi cheesecake dessert was superb!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review anything 1 star.... But I ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp. Firstly the waiter brought my plate out and said \"the cook forgot to drop the potatoes again with this meal so I will bring them out later\". The shrimp had no seasoning and a few of them were still translucent. I noticed after I took a bite and the texture was off that they were undercooked. I let the waiter know and he said sorry I will have them drop more shrimp (the shrimp was piled on my chicken and the onions and mushrooms). Everything was touching. He didn't take my plate and expected me to eat it. I Took a bite of my chicken and it was stringy and over cooked and barely edible. About 20 min later (after my party had finished most of its food) the waiter brought out my potatoes, they had no seasoning and were basically a half plate of boiled, flavorless potatoes. He then brought out my shrimp making a joke \"watch the cook probably burned them now\". I wasn't expecting much but my raw food not being replaced and the unintentional three course meal with no offer for reparations or a real apology was pretty subpar."}
{"text":"We went there recently. The steak I ordered was terrible so they cooked me another one, which was just as bad as the first one, so I switched to chicken instead. The manager was nice and took my meal off for us. However, it wasn't a good experience because they had to cook my food 3 times before they got it right! However, the appetizer wings were excellent - try the thai peanut wings - they're awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love Applebee's, but this location is getting older.  The restaurant isn't as clean as it used to be and the servers don't seem to care very much."}
{"text":"Just took my 15 y/o dd for dinner tonight. Greeted first, by a young lady holding the door, a hostess seated us immediately, and the waitress was at our table within minutes (a third smiling, friendly face). Iced tea and water brought to our table in another minute, dd had to wait maybe three minutes for a milkshake. Appetizer - I picked the sampler, was hot and delish! I love spin/art dip and the fresh chips only made it that much better.  Entrees: I chose the 'twofer' with steak and shrimp pompodore. Wonderful and filling. DD had a 12 oz steak n steamed veggies. She stole my breadstick, but with all that, we had enough leftover to take home for a very late supper. (we ate around 3 pm). All waitstaff (including the waiter who brought the shake, and complimented my purple hair, and DD's Pikachu shirt) went out of their way to make us happy and   satisified with our dining experience.  To the older 'lady' who thought she whispered the comment about my hair to her husband: at least I wasn't wearing pajamas and slippers, ya old biddy."}
{"text":"8/6/17 -  my wife and i have been eating at this location for about 3 yrs and it is the best happy hour around. Hands down! Great prices, great food and good service. Try the salsa verde nachos!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I went with my family for a quick lunch.  It was quick for them but for me who ordered a simple soup and salad it was torture.  They nearly completed their meals when I received mine.  My 8 yr old son offered me a piece of his grilled cheese sandwich because he felt bad."}
{"text":"Slow, rude waitstaff. Inept, rude management. All for \"average at best\" food.  Oh, and expect to be there for about an hour and a half only to feel completely defeated. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"We went to A's for their \"all you can eat\" riblets and chicken strips. Three adults, one toddler. Service was very slow and the busy time had not started. A half hour passed before our server appeared and took our orders. Nice enough server, but disappeared readily. I didn't actually time how long it took to get our meals, but it certainly was a long time. Food was average, cole slaw was in a tiny cup and was very soggy. We put in a refill request. It took so long that one of the adults took their child and left. A food runner finally appeared with our meals. The plates were very hot and the riblets were dry. Perhaps too long under the warming lights? Now there were three orders. Two were on plates. The third was on a kitchen metal sheet pan which the runner tried to hide behind the two plates. The plate that had the chicken strips had 6 pieces. The sheet pan had three. We asked for to go boxes and left. Usually I would have asked for the manager, but I feared I would be there for another hour. Someone should explain to the kitchen that quicker the food comes out, the quicker tables are turned over. Will never recommend A's to anyone."}
{"text":"The food here is always good, but the service is horrendous. Starting with the greeters. At Least  6 to 7 times we have walked in and stood there without being spoken to for several minutes. No welcome to Applebees no we'll be right with you, nothing. We would look past it cuz we enjoyed the food. However this last visit besides the usual lack of acknowledgement upon entering we waited for easily 40 minutes to be seated after being told it would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. After finally being seated we ordered The waitress didn't get the order right after coming back to the table to double check it. Besides messing up the side items (multiple) she came to check on us and we asked for a drink refill for my daughter which she never even brought. The food took an extraordinarily long time to come, by this time we had been there for about an hour and thirty minutes. we ate, paid and left. At the bottom of the receipt was the district managers name and number and a message that said tell us how we did. So I decide to call Athena and let her know about our experience. Since there was no answer I decide to leave a message complete with my name and contact info and a little about our experience. She never even bothered to return my call.  I even called a second time the next day after not hearing back from her. Again I was greeted by a voicemail and left a message. Seeing how the district manager handles customers explains a lot about how the restaurant operates. Needless to say we won't be going back to Applebees any longer."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest restaurant I've been to. I just walked out because my son spilled water on the seat. After I wiped the seat off with my napkin, I looked at my napkin and it was filthy, covered in dirt. Ugh. Before that, our waiter brought us our drinks and hovered over the spot he put the drinks in. Anything like residue or hair from him could've fallen in. Gross!! And there was a lot of debris like paper and food on the floor.  When is the last time they cleaned this place? Another waitress was holding food about to serve it to a different table and someone's pizza slice was touching her shirt. Last straw. I'm on the way home. I'd rather starve."}
{"text":"Ordered blue cheese with my wings and got tarter sauce. Spoke with server (a very friendly helpful server)  and she brought me another cup of blue cheese... Which was also tarter sauce... I then ordered a burger with onion and bacon and they brought me a burger with cheese and nothing more.. Not sure what they are thinking here. But with all the other competition in the area I will go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Applebee's I've been too I called in my order and waited 20 min to go pick it up when I got there they were friendly but i was just standing there waiting for my food to come up they said they had to find It then when I got back to my job they were missing the fries and my chicken was hard I call back they said I can come pick it up then I get there I'm just standing there nobody wants to ask me what's wrong until 10 min later I get my fries then I told them about my chicken and they said it's gonna come out hard (it's boneless chicken ) at the end I see why I should of read the reviews before coming here they need to do better they weren't even busy"}
{"text":"Unless you are at the bar getting drunk they don't care about you. The lady's today couldn't even give us refills. Service was bad and they didn't even pick up our appetizer plates. Maybe next time I'll come when Jeff and john are working, the treat everyone well."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for lunch one day. My ex found long hairs on his soda glass and in his food! We told the manager and they tried to offer him more food! \"Like no we dont want more contaminated food\" We all lost our appetite after this and have never returned. Maybe have your cooks wear hair nets??"}
{"text":"Was the first people in- just two of us. Another party of two walked in after us. They took them back first. We just thought it was because they didn't see us come in first. Then another party of two walked in and they automatically took them back first. They completely ignored us like we weren't there. We walked out and went to village in instead. They need to train their hosts better!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain about a place. However, I feel like I have to. We waited about 25 mins to be served. Nothing too bad. We got seated and ordered quickly  we then proceeded to wait another 30 mins for our appetizers to come out and not to mention even longer for our main plates to come come out. By the time I got what I ordered it was cold. I'm not sure it's because they didn't have many servers have a feeling it was mainly the kitchens fault. The manager was pretty nice tho. Still. Not worth the $80+ we payed for"}
{"text":"So my brother and I went to Applebee's this evening for dinner.  I haven't been there since we've been in Mesa. They seated us back in the back by the restrooms . Well, I can overlook that but then the young lady that's waiting on us asked us if we wanted something to drink and I said will give us a minute I wanna look at your menu. I have haven't been Applebee's in a long time.  The menu looked like Applebee's is competing with Chilis. Finally she came back and we just ordered lemon water. Maybe if we had drinks the entire episode would have been funny. So she leaves again and I'm squeezing the lemon in my water and I reached down and I have no napkins no silverware. I ask her to bring some napkins and that's all she brought us. I had to call her back and ask for some silverware and she brought us two forks so I said can we have a knife too. Then when we ordered Mike ordered a steak and rib combo plate and I ordered a Caesar salad and a bowl of French onion soup. When she brought the meal out, Mike's steak looked like the tiniest piece of shoe leather we've ever seen and no ribs. My Caesar salad was made with iceberg lettuce. We called her back over and she said that iceberg was all they had right now. (Because of the E. coli outbreak on Romain lettuce in Arizona but she didn't tell us that) As for Mike's ribs she didn't know that he asked for ribs so she went and put the order in again and said they were making them. By this time Mike and I are so pissed we didn't even have to call the manager over she just showed up at the table. She says what can I do to make this better and Mike says nothing this is terrible it's not even like what's on the menu. And she asks what we wanted to do and  Mike says nothing we're leaving. And we both got up and ?walked out. It was maddening and hilarious  at the same time. But one thing I can tell you I'll never go to an Applebee's again especially the one at Brown and Higley in Mesa."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was awful. The restaurant was practically empty, but it took over 5 minutes for someone to greet us at our table. My husband's order came out wrong... They brought his new food with the original potatoes-that were now cold. The oriental chicken salad I ordered was disappointing, basic, and was drenched with dressing. My mudslide had the consistency of chocolate milk and tasted like it too. The food took a long time-which was odd because the place was empty. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant. I wish I would have checked the Yelp reviews before we ate here!"}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations at all after reading the reviews. I only gave a 2 because they have rebel ipa on special on tap. They have now screwed up my SALAD 2 times and I've yet to get the third attempt. And no, it wasn't a complicated salad. I just asked for no onions. Bartender was very nice though. It's not her fault!"}
{"text":"Wow! A must! Put this place on your \"Must eats!\" list. I was completely surprised at the overall experience we had! I couldn't say enough about our experience! Sarah is absolutely amazing! Not only is she the perfect waitress for the service but she is perfect for the restaurant! Her detail is amazing!  She shows pride and what she does and excitement. She truly loves what she does and she loves food!  She upsold like crazy and we loved it! She was able to focus right in on what we liked and recommended the perfect appetizers and meals. She gave us an experience you would never expect at an Applebee's. After my hubby asked her a few things about a dish she recommended another and he took her recommendation. After he received the meal she comes back and asks \"would you like some bacon to add to that because I remember your first dish you wanted had bacon in it?\" She was an experience you just don't find enough of anymore. She was wonderful from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. She is the reason we will be returning hoping to get another experience dining with her. On top of all that she was really good conversation!  And aside from the excellent service I was absolutely shocked at how good our food was! She altered everything happily and with recommendations to fit my dietary needs! I was blown away at how happy she was to serve us and how much it felt like she was sharing the experience with us! To be honest I didn't expect much it was close to the house so I thought I would try. But based on this one experience I can tell you I will be returning again and I absolutely recommend this Applebee's location to anyone! Yes I recommend it to even the top Yelp Elites! Try this place ask for Sarah area and tell me about your experience! I would absolutely love to hear it!  Our lunch experience went above and beyond and I'm hoping this becomes a new regular favorite for myself and for you!   See pictures for our food order I recommend ALL OF IT!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the over all experience has other benefactors as well. The food was about a 4 star Service was a 3 star The environment was a 3.5 star We did the two meals with an appetizer for $25 and ordered a side of fries. It was all delicious! It's a great deal as far as I'm concerned.  The service was bare minimum. We didn't require much yet she couldn't remember refills on the soda. Her personality was nonexistent.  The booths were just terrible!! It was so uncomfortable! The booth is so far back from the table you can't sit with ease. It honestly hurt my back. The booths were unsightly with tears in the cushions. But overall I would return to this location."}
{"text":"I surrender!  This location blows.  We have tried it several times and will not go back.  Once we ordered togo ribs.  Well we got them home and instead of a sweet BBQ we got spicy.  Problem is I can't eat that.  Second time we went and dined in.  The steaks were chewy the fries cold had to send it all back.  The steaks still were bad but we got hot fries.  The salads were turning brown and our server was hard to get a hold of even though the place was not busy.  I recommend you don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I have been to this Applebee's a couple of times. Service is great. They offer military discount and they have week day lunch specials. Love it :)"}
{"text":"Price is excellent and I would go back and enjoy another round of chicken tenders with ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Applebee's is usually good for reasonably priced, decent tasting food. My experience at this particular Applebee's wasn't horrible but also wasn't anything that would make me want to go back.   Our party of three was seated quickly but service got fairly slow after that. Our waitress brought out wrong type of beer for one of the people with me, took a while to bring out the correct one and then took ages to bring extra napkins.  I had a lunch special that included half of a sandwich and a small salad. I had the shrimp and spinach salad which was excellent. The sandwich I went with was the California turkey club. The lettuce tasted sour, I had to pick it all off... And the bread was greasier then I would have preferred.  The sangria was damn tasty but could have used more fruit."}
{"text":"Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.    Met some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something.   As for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry.   Overall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.

{"text":"Ok for a quick lunch. The server was nice, but the food was average at best."}
{"text":"I have been to Applebee's in both Mount Pleasant and Monroeville a few times in the past. The food and service has always been satisfactory. When the new Applebee's opened up in Irwin, I thought that it was a nice addition, since Irwin is littered with fast food restaurants and sub-par chains.   My husband and I have attempted to go to the new Applebee's on a few occasions, however, it has always been so crowded and we refuse to wait. And I'm talking it's busy whether it's Friday night or a Wednesday around 8...doesn't matter, always busy when we go. Since we refused to wait to eat, we've always gone elsewhere...  Fortunately, this past Saturday, I was out shopping with my mom and it was early afternoon...1:30ish. Applebee's looked like it wasn't as crowded as usual, so we decided to give it a try.  We did the 2 or $20 deal and got the Spinach Artichoke dip for our appetizer. We both had the 'new' Chicken and Shrimp Tequila Tango. Let's just say that this was the first time I was \"wowed' by this place. The dip was delicious, of course. And I was surprised at how yummy our meals were. They consisted of one piece of grilled chicken, grilled shrimp, mexican rice, and sauteed peppers and onions. There is also a avocado / ranch sauce that was very good.   The other shocker here was the service...our waitress, Megan, was friendly and efficient. The manager also came over to ask how our meals are and I told him that Megan was an excellent waitress. He agreed, saying \"Yeah, Megan's the best.\" I asked the manager for a to-go cup for my drink, which he got for me instead of pawning it off on the waitress.   The place was still sorta busy, but we didn't have to wait. Bathrooms and restaurant were surprisingly clean for the just-after-lunch crowd. Case in point, there was a couple sitting across from us with a young child (thank goodness they left only a few minutes after we arrived. It was awkward because the mother sat sideways with the baby so she was literally five feet away from me and looking directly at me). At any rate, they left a huge mess and a lot of food spilled on the floor, which is gross, baby or not. Before I knew it, someone had come to bus the table and cleaned up the mess of the floor...within literally two minutes. I was so thrilled to see that...lots of places would have left it there and I would have been grossed out.  Good food, great service, clean digs! Bravo Applebee's!"}
{"text":"My wife has had a salad here twice and gotten sick twice.  We have had the cooked items and they are average. Happy hour appetizers are decent. Employees can be clueless ... they are currently promoting a perfect margarita offer. If the staff doesn't offer you a Perfect Margarita, then you are supposed to get one on-the-house. They failed to mention it on arrival and a half hour later when we saw the sign we asked about it. The response was \"Would you like one? There, I just offered it. You don't qualify.\""}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible!! I don't know if the waitress was new or not good but she did horrible. No manners or good attitude. Food is alright!"}
{"text":"This wouldn't even be one star for me. I ordered carside to go, and got there right when my order was supposed to be done. No body came out so I went to the door and it was locked. I moved my car to go to the other entry way and I had no where to park. So I maneuvered around the parking lot and just parked by the curb. That was five minutes of trying to figure out where I can get in. After I walk in, the bar area was filled, restaurant portion wasnt. So I found the nearest employee to ask about my order, she just told me to talk to the bartender and didn't bother to try to help me. I can understand the bartender being busy with all the drinks people were ordering so I wanted patiently. He knew my name and order right away and asked the woman I originally talked to if she could go back and check on my food. She didn't, so he asked the next person who came out of the kitchen about my order. The woman told us it would be another five minutes, which the bartender apologized for and went back to making more drinks while keeping an eye on the kitchen. Essentially I waited an extra fifteen minutes just for my food. But that wasn't the end of it. I got in the car checked the boxes to make sure my order was correct. I grabbed a piece of chicken out to try and it was completely cold! When I got home I opened the other boxes and everything was cold! The nachos were cold and soggy and the chicken was super cold. The fries were hard as rocks and cold, like they've been sitting on the counter for a couple hours. The burger wasn't even hot, it was warm enough. But not like it just got done cooking... So my question is, if my order took an extra fifteen minutes why on earth would all my food be cold?! I'll never use carside service again. I guess the only plus side is my dog gets to eat all the cold inedible food I couldn't stomach.  *this is an update since I made this review, I believe I have also gotten food poisoning from here. I ate what I could then went to bed shortly after. I woke up at 330am feeling very nauseous. Every hour I was kneeling over the toilet, I could hardly get out of bed. It was terrible. This lasted for the whole day and onto the next. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The happy hour every one speaks of is only available in the bar which is not the way it is in my home town. Everything I would have ordered in my home town also would have been covered for a bill of about $20 instead only 1 of the four was covered and after taking 1 item off it was still just under $40. Service was fine and so was the food. I usually tip at twice the bill since I'm getting it at half price and they still do the same work that's only fair. Oh I also ordered exactly the same last week at a different one here in Vegas and all of it was half off so ya low rating because I feel a little taken advantage of."}
{"text":"I ask for water and two other tables get offered drinks , and served, yet I don't have my 1 water . When I ask for it again I get the \"give me a second\" and then another table gets offered drinks . I asked for a cocktail , disgusting , I asked if I can switch it , I get the \"I need to talk to my boss first .\" Then I said , can you take it either way I don't want it ...I get the \"hang on a Sec \" ...yet again . Never did my partner get offered another drink. He had finished his first beer before entree came out, and nothing was ever offered. We asked for a box ...that's when the \"can I get you something else \" phrase comes in . I'm sorry but the fact that this Applebee's happens to be on the east side does not mean the service has to be shameful . I should had just gone to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Sitting here at the car side to go spot and I called in to let them know I am here and couldn't imagine a more disrespectful person picking up the phone, she cut me off when I was trying to speak to her, and then she hung up on me mid sentence. When she came out to my car she was nothing but impolite. It was the customer service tonight that may have deterred me from ever coming back to Applebees.   The food was great, but food isn't the only part of the experience. Despite the good food the customer service has turned me away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"My daughter and i went here for lunch and the service was ok.  We ordered the 2 for $25. I had to keep reminding the waiter of the appetizer and come to find out that we should have had a desert.  It's now a day later      ...  i guess i was so irritated i forgot to remind me him of the desert that goes with it. Lol!"}
{"text":"The server we had tonight named Ashley was very very nice & mainly the reason why I am giving this review 3 stars , the food was HORRIBLE ... but the service we got was amazing , the cook messed our order up & not only messed up the order but gave us BURNT chicken ... but thank you for having great guest service Ashley !"}
{"text":"It's Applebee's.  What else can you say?  This location had a great wait staff.  No issues.  The new appetizer menu is great too."}
{"text":"Hey, it's Applebee's, same as the others. Service was acceptable and the Asian Chicken Salad exactly what I wanted.  I will return when I get a hankering for it again, please do not remove from your menu!"}
{"text":"I have ate here twice on my travels. Applebee's is consistent as a chain and this one keeps that tradition, not a 4 star restaurant but the food and service were good."}
{"text":"Blah Blah Blah.  Everytime I eat at Applebees, it gets worse & worse. The service stinks & the food is worse.    The new 2 for $20 entrees should be 2 for $10.   This has got to be one of the worst chains in America.  Why?  The roast beef sliders come on greasy, crusty bun, the chicken fingers are more breading than chicken & the fries are greasy & soggy.  I really can't recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area - unless you're already a big applebees fan."}
{"text":"Poor service. The waiters were all standing around singing along to the music. Very weird. When they weren't singing, they were gossiping loudly to each other. No one in my party was happy with their food quality. Poor cuts of meat, poorly cooked. Also the bathroom had huge puddles of water in it. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst. Applebee's. Ever.  The food tasted terrible, it was microwaved and lukewarm.  The vegetables were drowned in butter and was still horrible.  I called for a refund and the general manager was not surprised at all.  I had no idea that a chain restaurant could fail to deliver on every component of a meal.  Literally, every other restaurant in the area is better."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to give it a chance and no. I work at a restaurant myself on the strip so I know how the front and back works for the most part id like to think. 1 problem I had was with my wife she ordered chicken that was extremely over cooked and if ruined her appetite but I asked the server if she could just take it away it was bad and our server wanted to tell us that it's supposed to be made like that and she was eating it in the back just now. First off I wouldn't tell me guess I'm eating in the back when I'm supposed to be working and cashing out my tables. Second it just seemed she was trying to get out of having to void the meal. I can see that she was very mad.  Another time coming with my friend we were seated at a table that wasn't wiped down and food everywhere on the floor. We left before our waiter even came it was bad.  I gave it 2 stars cause there are select few employees who are great who should be moved to a better restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and ordered the two for $25.00 rib dinner. It was awful the ribs were dry and the texture of beef jerky. Very small portions. Won't be going back anytime soon. Would have rather spent more and gone to Longhorns. The service was bad and nothing about the meal was good."}
{"text":"I've always had good experiences at Applebee's.  This one is no different.  The staff working right now, Jun. 28th is amazing!  They are doing all the \"right\" things.  I'm just sitting at the bar, but watching.  The hostess was very friendly.  The bartender, Maggie, is friendly and very hard working.  The Manager on duty is table-touching.  All the guests seem very happy!"}
{"text":"If you would like to wait an hour to get your food, and once it's served it's cold and burned; then I would recommend this restaurant. If you want fast service, hot food....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!. My party of 4 have tried this particular restaurant twice and it's the same old story...cold food, they brought the same manager over, same ol same ol... She apologized, took my wife's ribs off the bill but the bottom line, it was a waste of time to go there. We went there at approx. 715pm and didn't leave till 830ish and they were not busy at all. Ridiculous!!   We'll be going to Chili's just a little further down the street...."}
{"text":"Food was great, waitress was great. Over all, fantastic! EXCEPT the music was way too loud for 3:12 pm on a Wednesday. Playing heavy rock music and 2012 year club music. Making me nervous Applebee's , r u ok?"}
{"text":"It is absolutely fitting that this Applebee's gets a 3 star rating. A-OK. It is the epitome of A-OK. The seating is A-OK. Food is A-OK. Ambiance is A-OK. It is the most average place you could eat.   The server was average. Not too nice, not an ass. Average. He looked like he led an average life, nothing exciting but nothing shady. The booths were average. They have a design on them specifically to make you forget about them. It was almost like staring at a casino floor, it has patterns but nothing you could ever remember. The walls are decked with Rebels stuff but I can't remember a single thing. That was also made to seem appealing but entirely forgettable. The music level also was at some optimal level, just enough to make out the words but not loud enough to drown out your conversation.  We did the 2 for $25 deals. Mozzarella sticks had the breading actually stay on which was good. Unfortunately, there was TOO MUCH breading and then trying to think how many chemicals or the process to keep that breading on there made us worry. Marinara sauce was weak, nothing good there. Ribs were average. The smokey chipotle BBQ sauce was actually good. But no good deed goes unpunished as the ribs were a tad burnt and hard to cut. Shrimp that came with it were pretty gross actually. Not fresh and greasy. Four cheese mac n cheese was not great. It was weirdly sweet and the chicken fingers they put on were comically small.   But hey, drinks were like $4. So that makes up for some poor food.   I really think the person who designed/designs for Applebee's is a genius. They have perfected the art of the average dining experience. The food isn't good but it wasn't offensively bad, like it's not the best meal but it was $25 for the whole thing. Eh. The ambiance is generic but nice enough to have a conversation. It's non-threatening. When you are finally tired of debating with your picky friends on where they want to end, you all end up at Applebee's, because why not. Guaranteed to be average."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday at 3pm with my daughter and her 3 kids, ages 7, 4 8 months. I always tip well because... kids. We were seated right away at a booth. The restaurant was fairly empty. As with other reviews, no silverware on our table; all tables around us had silverware. So, why put us there??? They brought 4 adult menus. No kids menus. Idiots. We asked for them and it took 5 more minutes to get them. Then waited 10 additional minutes for waitress to come get our order. Drinks came right out, but food was slow, although very good. Since we had no silverware, we had no napkins. Um, 3 kids.... had to ask for napkins and silverware. We were almost done eating when the 4 year old needed the restroom. While he and his mom were gone, the other 3 of us continued eating. That's when one of the staff decided it was a good time to start sweeping under our table. What? Vacuuming while we are still eating? Scared the baby, who started crying... well, we ended our meal early, got the check and to go boxes. Was told to pay at the table on the little tablet. Oh, joy, that wasn't working, had to grab a waitress to tell our waitress to come back and take my credit card. Another 10 minutes later, we left.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the problem is with the reviews , went for lunch today , staff very friendly , had chips and salsa which were ok , also bourben street chicken and shrimp which was excellent , salad was fresh , one down side tomato and basil we thought came out of a can and find out it came out of a bag , not to far off on That one , $4 dos Equis not bad , again staff very friendly will be back"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!  Horrible...... Just absolutely sad & horrible.  Horrible food..... horrible management!  Here's the why:  The hostess seemed to me like a snotty teenager with an attitude. You know the type, an obviously self-absorbed, entitled millennial with more attitude than personal skills or intelligence. If only Twitter, Facebook and The Kardashians (likely her life-guides) would tell her to act professional and friendly.   I won't hate on the kid waiting our table because none of this was his fault. He didn't cook the lousy food or fail miserably on the other aspects of this nightmare. He seemed like a cool young guy who was doing what he should be doing: working hard and making a living. Bravo to him.   Lets start with the manager, or whatever level of supervisor she was.  An unhappy looking middle aged lady. The order was wrong and instead of keeping her pie hole shut and fixing it she wanted to argue...... really? Look, I'm not \"tough customer,\" I was a waiter & cook for years and I know that when a customer wants something fixed it's easier to just do it than to be a wanker about it. \"The Customer is King\" was a slogan that created many great businesses, and it is truly dead in today's America. This miserable old lady reaffirmed that.   The food sucked! The steaks were not steaks..... I'm not kidding. I honestly think they were some type of skirt or flank being passed off as better cuts. Greasy, fatty and caked in salt. HORRIBLE!  I heard two other close tables talking and it was obvious they were having the same lousy experience we were.    We had several folks in our party with various dishes. Everyone had the same bad experience, I was so embarrassed.... I picked this dump. I had eaten at another Appelbee's about a year ago and it was decent. This location just sucked.  Go ahead and try this spot out....... if you enjoy REHEATED meat dishes and snotty management that wants to argue. Otherwise avoid this spot like a dog turd in the street friends. HORRIBLE!  We, our families & friends (and their family and friends) WILL NEVER EAT AT AN APPLEBEE'S EVER AGAIN IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT!  HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"If you have been to one Applebee's you've pretty much have been to them all.  Just your basic average chain.  I wanted a quick bite close to the Thomas and Mack so I didn't have to drive too far for my show.  I was not stepping in here to be impressed, but I actually was.  We were seated right away.  Wait staff wasn't overly friendly, which I like.  My hubby and I ordered the two for twenty deal, which is a great bargain.  We started off with the mozzarella sticks.  Most Applebee's will give you six, eight if your lucky.  We got ten and just about got filled up on them.  I got the A-1 steak burger and it was really good and they cooked it just how I ordered it.  Hubby got the double crunch shrimp and the portion was so big my mini hungry-hungry hippo could hardly finish it.  I also really liked the fries here.  They left off the nasty spice most Bee's put on there and let us choose dipping sauces for them.  If I'm in the area I will eat at this Applebee's again, this might be the only one I'll go to from now on."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Worst experience I've ever had at an AppleBees. My family has been countless times before without issue - we understand not to expect high end quality for a neighborhood restaurant.. But our visit to this location was awful. My husband asked for a medium rare steak - it was beef jerky.. The vegetables on his plate were \"steamed\" to the point of trash. The pasta in my dish tasted as if they made it days before and recooked it - some pieces were hard as if microwaved and some were completely mush. The honey \"drizzled\" sauce was more of a drenched soup. Our glasses stayed empty - waitress never refilled them until we asked for our check. Yes let me have another drink as I'm paying and choking on crappy food. The hostess had a HORRIBLE attitude - watched her be rude and talk back to an elderly gentleman. Upset about every moment of this experience. Especially having to pay $50 when we could've ate better at McDonald's!!"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. Sat at the bar. Two bartenders with hardly anyone seated. Dining room had a 20 min wait but there were many empty tables??? Had the Louisiana shrimp and chicken that was tasty enough but small portion. Wife had wings that she enjoyed. Staff seemed board with nothing to do. There are better choices in the area but this one will do if you can't get to anything else. Beer was cold and enjoyable"}
{"text":"I recently read an article on how reddit had asked for reviews on horrible dining experiences. Turns out Applebee's was highly unpopular to say the least. I am not one to simply buy in on hype so I decided to try it for myself and see if the location near me deserved to be included with all that negativity.  Overall it was an average experience. Our waitress Lisa tended to range from friendly to out right cold on what appeared to us as nothing more than a whim. The opening order and drinks she was warm and friendly, delivering the food and follow ups was not friendly at all and finally checkout was back to warm and friendly.  Our food (both of us had the triple bacon burger) was not cooked to what we asked for (pink). Our burgers were well done to the point of being crumbly. We also had the spinach artichoke dip appetizer that was pretty good. Not the top shelf mind you but , better than what you might expect from a chain restaurant.  Based on this experience I cannot agree with the reddit article but this place has some room for improvement."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I will not return."}
{"text":"Well, I love Applebee's! It's cheap delicious and fast. Me, my mom and niece went in for dinner. They sat us down right away everything was great. It's my niece's birthday so they sang to her and we ate yummy cake! Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Clearly there is a reason this place has a low rating. What's the point of calling ahead to order take out if my food won't be ready until 40 minutes after they said it would. Also, the person that takes the order should know the menu. I didn't even ask any questions about the food. They just didn't know what I was actually ordering. Ridiculous. Food is good, but service is terrible."}
{"text":"So wanted to catch the game and grab food.. lil did we know 45 mins later we would finally get our appetizer then another 20 mins before we got our burgers with them being made incorrectly!!! Ordered a drink and waited another 10 mins...  Left upset, frustrated and unsatisfied..."}
{"text":"I got a burnt fish. Thanks for the lunch tho. It was great eating burnt fish... On a date..."}
{"text":"The bartender was very rude. I asked him to fix a drink that was bad and he told he wouldn't fix it that I should just get something else. The server wasn't really sure what was on happy hour. No manager was alerted about my disservice."}
{"text":"My husband come here every week.... the staff is friendly and always on point. Miranda and the other bartender girl are amazing. I would suggest you give them a try. I'm so in love with the 9oz  steak..."}
{"text":"I went in tonight 2/14/18 to eat with some friends. We were waiting a long time for our food and when it finally came out, the person bringing our food dropped two hot skillets on our table. One of my friends and I got burned. The food was extremely hot and it landed all over my lap. I don't want to blame the guy who dropped it. I understand that he had a long and busy day, so I'm not mad at him. I'm mad at how ridiculous the management was. No manager came to apologize or anything. I was literally sitting there covered in food and no manager ever came by to check what happened. That really irritated me and I just walked out. My friends said that they still had to pay for everything. Even the untouched food that I left there. Nothing was taken off our bill, we weren't offered anything because of the incident, and we didn't receive an apology from management. A simple apology from management would have been enough for me to not have walked out and not be this angry.  The management here does not care about their customers. Unless you want to be treated that way, I would stay out of that establishment.  To the guy who dropped the food, I appreciate your apology. Things happen sometimes and I know you had a long day. So thank you for that."}
{"text":"I have been to the other location off Stephanie and won't go back there. So, we decided to try this location out. It was probably like 2 hrs before closing, so we sat at the bar. The bartender Matt, was really nice and helpful. We had few drinks and beers along with the steak app quesadilla  and the nachos. Boy, did I love those nachos! Manager also was super nice :-) defiantly will be going back here!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.. Wasn't impressed. I have had better back home in Indiana. I have never been anywhere else till now lol. I had the BBQ boneless wings (came out kind of cold) the siracha shrimp was disgusting (no flavor) I gagged and I liked the hamburger egg rolls. My husband liked the garlic sirloin steak but needed more flavor in the mash potatoes. The macaroni was very good ;) my mother and father in law both loved their burger and salad. Not sure if I'll be back soon :-/ and yes I did tell a manager, only way they could fix the problems. And the pickles were spicer then the siracha shrimp"}
{"text":"First of all, the \"perfect\" margarita was not perfect. The appetizers were good, but not great.  The crazy thing when we get the check at around 5:30pm it doesn't have the happy hour prices of half off. When we asked if they were the correct prices the waitress said yes that meant the margaritas were $18 really really totally not worth it and to top it off the hostess at the door said they don't really know the prices. Also seemed like they were short staffed and didn't have any napkins my sister had to easy all-you-can-eat ribs with only one napkin!  Sorry applebees i really love you but will not be returning to your Craig road location.  For spending well over $100 could have had a better experience somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had family dinner here Thursday evening and we were very impressed with our service. Our waiter was extremely attentive and caring. The food was delicious as can be. Seriously seems like Applebee's has stepped up its game. We will definitely be back soon. French onion soup was an amazing discovery, delicious!"}
{"text":"I will give this Applebees location a 5 star and here's why. I used to work here and know the cooks and staff. I have inside information on how this location does things in relationship to other locations I had filled in at.   This location has better cooks and better management than some of the other locations. It shows in the food. Very seldom do I eat at this location and get a bad meal.   Best nights to go Friday or Saturday after 4pm. The best cooks are working then, these guys have been at this location for over 8 years and they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Applebee's has revamped and come a long way. Food is better. Three cheese penne is to die for. Absolutely addictive. Had dinner there last night. Melissa was our waitress. She was quick and did an excellent job. Some of the best service we've had in a while. Food was cooked in a timely matter and arrived at the perfect temperature."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner, and frequently come here. Their food is good, service is better. Any time of the day or day of the week, great service. Good menu choices for the kids, and fast service."}
{"text":"I think Applebees is a good value for the food served. I highly recommend the butter pecan blondie dessert."}
{"text":"Upon entrance, the decor, environment, and lighting is all very welcoming. However, there wasn't a hostess present to seat is, so my girlfriend and I sat down. After a few minutes, a waitress approached us and asked if we needed menus, to which we replied yes (we were unaware of the new Tablet-based ordering system). We got the 2 for 25 special.   Mozzarella sticks: came out very fast and were crispy with stringy cheese.  4 Cheese Mac with Honey Pepper Chicken: Slightly sweet taste, with a decent cheese flavor. Chicken was crunchy and tasted great.  Grilled Bourbon Chicken & Shrimp: all around great flavor.   Service was great all in all. Food came out within 10 minutes. Waitress constantly stopped by and made sure we were doing okay. Will stop by again!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Applebee's. From their food to the service it's definitely deserves a 4 star rating in my book. My husband and I stopped for supper tonight. Tonight was burger night, that meant you could get any burger and fries for $6.99. As enticing as that sounded we decided to order off the 2 for $20 menu. You get one appetizer and certain menu choices for 20 dollars. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips. This dip is so good. Warm and creamy. The entree I chose was the chicken tenders and fries. It comes with your choice of ranch, honey mustard or bbq sauce. I chose the honey mustard. The chicken strips are good, the breading is lightly seasoned. The fries are crispy, but over salted and seasoned for my taste. The honey mustard sauce is thick, creamy and not too sweet. It's perfect. The service is great. Tonight the place was busy, but our server never faltered on checking on us and making sure we were taken care of. I will be back as this is one of my favorite restaurants,"}
{"text":"Oh, Applebee's, you predictable chain, you. Located in Macedonia, Ohio, otherwise know as the epicenter for hideous, soul-destroying sameness; how I despise you!   Oh, where to start? For one, how does this place or its ilk remain consistently busy? Is this or the unexplainable attraction to other similar chain restaurants somehow a reflection of society? Do the people patronizing boring sameness like this strive for anything above mediocre? Simply put, what is wrong with people?   Applebee's is the poster child for everything that is wrong with the overpopulated, over-the-top, un-original, flair crazed dining landscape of the mainstream American chain.   Cheesy, disingenuous, robotic, intelligent-insulting wait service. Crap schmeared and strung about on the walls in a cluster-fuck fashion. The place is too happy, too bright, tables too sticky, too many kids screaming and I haven't even gotten to the food yet! I struggle to understand how THIS has become an acceptable means of dining!   For whatever reason, most people fear the unknown, but find comfort in sameness. You KNOW what Applebee's offers even before you step foot in the door and what to expect. Your brain is overwhelmed with TV, radio and print ads announcing the latest un-inspiring \"Pick-'N-Pair\" lunch combos & \"Ultimate Trios\".  It's the same whether you're in Singapore or San Jose, California. To most, this is comforting.  To any future readers out there, please, for the love of God, try someplace new next time you dine out. You may surprise yourself. Take Little Timmy and the family out to a local Mom & Pop eatery instead. You may feel better about yourself upon leaving. At the very least, part of your soul and dignity will still be in tact."}
{"text":"A week or so ago I went to this particular Applebees and left pretty upset. I immediately went home and wrote a comment about my unhappiness and told them I would never return because of the service received that day (note that this is the first and only time I've received bad service from this location). The next day I received a call from the GM, returned the call and couldn't reach him. Like anyone else, I'm busy and forgot to call back another day. Today a manager actually came to my home with flowers (!!!) to apologize since they couldn't reach me, which shocked me to no end. I've never, ever seen any company go to such great lengths to keep a customer. It really impressed me, and now I will totally go back."}
{"text":"Service was not the greatest. Typically servers will ask if you want more coffee when they see that you are empty. Our server, Ashley didn't bother, I asked for more coffee, which she did eventually bring.  My husband asked for melted butter on the side to dip his salmon in.  He asked twice and she never brought it.  I did have a side of whipped butter on the side with my salad, what?!  I didn't ask for cold butter.  Way too much dressing on my salad. The grilled chicken on the salad was ice cold, it was supposed to be warm. Worst salad I have ever paid for, I only ate about 1/4 of it. The broccoli soup was delicious, would've been better with a few crackers, but they were never brought.  Apparently Ashley forgot.  She also forgot to offer us gift cards which would get us a free appetizer next time. We didn't even bother to ask, as we will not be going back to this location.  We've gotten great service here previously, but not lately. The location in Lorain is much better."}
{"text":"My dad was in town and asked if there was a sit down restaurant nearby to take us out to, concerned about his budget I was like oh Applebee's is just across the road. We all went in for a meal and were seated instantly near the bar. Our server in particular was fine, no problems at all. Our table however was filthy, not like hadn't been cleaned after the previous customer, but caked with dust and debris on the ledges around the booth. I work in a restaurant and my bosses would be appalled if a customer sat down to a table looking like that. Also I'm sure this is Applebee's brand as a whole and not just this location but the prices are outrageous for the quality of food you get. I personally didn't order any drinks but we were seated near the bar where the bartender was continuously on her phone and touching her hair, face, and chest. This is a huge no when working with food and drinks and I'm glad she wasn't asked to assist our server with anything."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I got the build your own sampler with spinach dip(the best ever) and sliders (okay) and steak tortillas (okay). The one thing that really sucked was the long wait for the waitress. We were in the bar area and the waitress Ashley... I don't think she mulit task. It took her a while to get our drinks, take our order and then the people that came after us got their food before us and even left before us because we were waiting so long. We literally waited 20 minutes before someone got our check.  Don't think I'll be back at this location..."}
{"text":"The only place serving food and drinks after 11pm on a Sunday night.   Ordered burgers and fries. Waited a long time for the food. It was hot and as ordered. Fries were extra salty but otherwise no complaints.   Absolutely horrible music played the entire time."}
{"text":"service is really depends on your waiter, it's okay if you go at dinner time, before and after awful."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but it was busy tonight and the staff couldn't handle it.. then they seated screaming children in the bar... WTF?? it's a BAR for a reason.   The bartenders at this place are great that's why I prefer to sit at the bar but not with children."}
{"text":"Lunch on 12/7/11...a bad choice. Not crowded@ about 1:30 p.m. We always sit in the bar area. Not a good idea to have the bartender wait tables. First...ordered a glass of Sutter Home Pinot Grigio. Was told \"we don't have that now\" and was offered Little Black Dress Pinot. I asked if it was the same price as the Sutter Home..told it wasn't but was advised she would \"give it to me at that price today because I was having a bad day\". Why should I pay more for an \"upsell\" when they didn't have what was on the menu?  Ordered sandwich with fries. Received my meal and the fries were old, shriveled and barely warm..so were my husband's. Obviously, we were given the leftovers from lunch that had been sitting under the heat lamp. Asked for and received freshly made, hot fries. The manager approached our table asking how everything was. I let him know what had transpired. He seemed totally disinterested but he did comp my lunch. The bartender/waitress came with our check and she basically admitted that we were served the \"leftovers\" from the early lunch service. This Applebees has gone downhill in the past several years. We used to have lunch here quite often in the late 1990's but we will not be back. Things have steadily deteriorated the past couple of times we've been here. I don't think it's too much to ask for hot fries and to have an item you offer on the menu. Another example of the lack of quality and concern by chain restaurants!!!!'hmmm"}
{"text":"Applebee's is just one of those boring chain restaurants.  I do really love some chains, but alas, Applebee's is not one of them.   Everything is just ok.  Nothing ever blows my socks off or makes me crave to come here, but it isn't bad either, just blah.  I found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with.  Oh well, it happens.  We went for lunch and it was an ok experience.  I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger.  It was surprising yummy.  It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in my mouth.  It was better than I was expected, which was a nice surprise.  The other people in the party both got the 3 cheese penne and chicken dish.  I didn't sample it, but they both enjoyed it.  My picky eater, my 18 month old did surprise me by eating half of her grilled cheese.  She never eats anything, so that made me happy.  I tried a bite and it was quite good with the bread being a sweet, eggy bread, like brioche.    The service was really good and we always had what we wanted without having to ask for it, which made for a pleasant meal.  So over all, the food was good, the service was great, but I am still bored with the overall place.  Give me Chili's anyday, but this Applebee's did a good job today.  Way to go Applebee's for slowing changing my opinion about you."}
{"text":"We had the best service ever! Jennifer was very attentive and always smiling. She was so sweet to my 5 year old daughter and because of her we'll be back! The food was good too but the service was very impressive! It's nice to see people who love their job! Thanks Jennifer :-)"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant , friendly staff , food was decent , prices are very affordable .. Especially if you can hit them up at happy hour ! We split an order of onion rings (best part of the dinner )  I had the 6 inch steak, garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli . Steak was ok, mashed potatoes were great !! And broccoli was steamed and tasted like broccoli !? Lol.. Reuben had the baby back ribs with fries and broccoli . He said it was good , not fantastic but he ate the whole thing. We ordered our food from the 2 for $25 section so our dinner came with an appetizer . Again very affordable &  larger portions .  I think I will stick to ordering appetizers and drinks during happy hour . Their apps are always fantastic !"}
{"text":"I had not been to an Applebee's in over a year until tonight. My family lives out in Queen Creek and our options around there are very limited. We decided tonight on this Applebee's because it was fairly close and the wait was way to long at the Native New Yorker in Queen Creek.   The food was okay. Not bad but not great. The beer prices are great. The service was good. I had jalapeno lime shrimp with rice which had good flavor. My sister had lemon butter fettuccine alfredo with shrimp which she enjoyed. I had not been to an Applebee's in a long time prior to this because I had some really bad experiences at a location in Chandler over a year ago. It seems as though they have changed the menu quite a bit. There are still some staple items that Applebee's has always had but definitely some added items as well. I would say that Applebee's is trying to do too much with this new menu. They have seafood, sandwiches, pasta, chicken, burgers and more it's too much. They should try to do two or three things really good instead of trying to do too many things mediocre. But alas it is a chain.  I would visit this location again. It wasn't bad. I might just stick to beer and apps next time but we'll see..."}
{"text":"I have been to many Applebee's over the years, but the bartender is what made this experience worth the 5-stars. I sat down at the bar and was quickly greeted by the bartender who appears to be well-known by a lot of the locals. She was very polite, called me dear, and was quick to fixing my drink. You could tell the locals liked her because she knew what they drank before they ever sat down and was already working on their drinks. I enjoy establishments who get to know their customers and learn their drink and order habits.  The food was tasty, but the friend chicken was a bit overcooked on the exterior. You can tell their oils temperature is too high, but it cooked the chicken to a good temperature. If you like a good gravy, try their stout gravy and always ask for extra. It is that good!"}
{"text":"I only recommend the food. The service is disappointing (as said in almost all of the most recent reviews).  The food is good. It comes out HOT. Literally the plates are hot to the touch. Flavors are good. Good options. Not too extensive of a menu. Some specials. I am sure a lot of people went for their dolla-ritas.   Service: had to ask for plates when we got an appetizer (steak quesadilla), lots of laughter from servers in the kitchen and no servers to be found on the floor sometimes, and no refills for water even.  If you don't care about service -- go for it. Good luck."}
{"text":"Went for the great any two you want special.  Turns out it is any two they want you to have.  Could not get it as there is absolutely no changes or substitutions.  Really, they sell food, I have money, but I cannot get what I want.  I talked to two managers and they were of zero help.  No options, just kept blaming corporate.  I guess corporate is terrible and not them.  Come on, do better."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. Service is ok. Be prepared for a high school reunion."}
{"text":"The hostess (Ricki) here is really nice and the food she suggested hit the spot. What's not to like great hostess coo food and beer! My son also thought the hostess was awesome!"}
{"text":"The food we had today was perfectly done! The atmosphere was great but what made our experience even better was the service.  Jon-Curtis made us feel like we were his only customers! He served others of course, but what a gift he has to make us all feel special at the same time! OUTSTANDING JON-Curtis! You can teach these skills to others bro! Thank you."}
{"text":"Terrible service      food not as ordered... told the manager about it and we got a whole 10% off.... BIG Disappointment!!!  stay away from this Applebee's not up to Corporate standards for sure"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. The waitress was very nice and have no complaints about her. However, the food, was just awful. It was so terribly generic and flavorless I don't know how Applebee's stays in business. Why do people go there? We had a gift card and that's the only reason. Of course, we forgot the gift card...but ya know what? We aren't going to go back to use it because it was that bad. I really don't understand why anyone would go there. The food was so generically terrible I don't know why someone would spend money on it."}
{"text":"For my 100th Yelp here we go! I love this place and have many fond memories of coming here. Never a bad meal, never a bad experience. I'll keep coming back as long as that stays. My first date with my husband happened here and it will always be dear to my heart. I like the location and I swear it's never busy."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch at 3:00pm with my mother. We needed to catch something relatively fast before we headed out to complete some chores. The staff was really friendly to us. They seated us in an area that was super sunny and I ended up facing the sun. When I brought it up with the waitress in our section, she promptly moved us to another section, closed the blinds in our section and the manager came by to apologize.  We promptly ordered our meal with 2 classes of water. We ordered:  -cajun shrimp pasta -roman pepper steak total cost was a little bit over $20.00.  The wait between ordering and service was about 10 minutes. The shrimp wasn't tough and the pasta wasn't over cooked. The steak was tougher than I liked, I ordered medium well done.  The flavor was ok, the texture of the shrimp and pasta ok but the steak tasted ok but kind of wimpy looking. My mother was not disappointed but didn't really like the restaurant; it was her first time at Applebee's. Her first comment, when the food arrived was, is that it looked nothing like the pictures in the menu's. It lacked the sheen and quantity as seen in the menu. My steak was, simply put, nothing much to look at.  All in all, the food isn't worth going to, but the service was friendly and helpful. Did I mention my waster glass was never past half empty. A star just for that. One last thing, there were a pair of old ladies, friends, sitting next to our booth. They had to have been there for at least an hour before us. They slowly ate through some chips, then ordered an appetizer as we were leaving. They chatted, laughed and the service still kept on smiling and checking in on them. Totally cool of Applebee's."}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband Saturday night and had a great time. We went around 5:30 pm and was seated right away. Our waiter was so quick and attentive. He immediately took our drink order! Then I swear just as we decided on what we wanted he got our order. Food was a decent value. We both order the 3 for $12 appetizer deal. I had hot wings which were the best around. Which is saying a lot. I love wingstreet wings! I also had the beer battered pretzels. They were good. I would have like more than 2 though.... The mott sticks were great! My husband loved his won ton tacos, shrimp, and whatever else he had. I can't recall now. I really like that they now have a screen that can allow you to play games, get drink refills and call your waiter. We never used it for those options but it's nice that they exist. We did use it to pay. Which was fast and convenient! I even used it with my gift card and credit card. It even gave a option to split the check! So cool!"}
{"text":"Joe was great at his job! GREAT! My brother and his girl friend go here about 3 times a week and have become friends with the team but Joe was the bar tender and he was on point and kind! I will go back to get a drink from Joe! The table service is a little slow and it takes a long time to get your food and even longer to pay. So If you come here sit at the bar and ask for Joe!"}
{"text":"This is second time there within 6 weeks. Booth times young hostess said 20 minute wait. Today there were 10 empty tables. I asked the hostess why will all the empty tables did we have to wait. She said we just got a place party and the kitchen is backed up. That is SAME excuse we heard last time, this is same hostess  we had last. I said to her so we get excuses.  Why could she not at least seat people instead of the door being blocked. I called the manager after we walked out. She said she would take to the girl, I informed her this happened the last time we were there. We will Not go back again."}
{"text":"I wish there was a zero!!! Unfortunately, my teenage daughter, who has experienced far nicer establishments, likes Applebees and this is the closest one... they are slow, you have to ask for basics like water and silverware, the food is sub par even for their own brand, bathroom is filthy and it's the same every time we come!!! I promise I will go to a different one next time she asks!!!"}
{"text":"Good reverse happy hour. And the pictures in the menu *look* phenomenal. Richard Christie might have something with his love of aaaaaaaapple beeeeeeeeeeeeessssssss...  but honestly, the reverse happy hour has a lot of 1/2 off stuff."}
{"text":"Absolutely annoyed.  We are regulars at this applebees usually there nights after 9 or 10 o'clock at least once a week. We often sit and have a few drinks with some appetizers. Being that we are there so often we are usually served without any issues. They gave us a hard time and would not serve us any drinks (everyone at the table was 21, with proof) needless to say. I will not be returning to this applebees and they have lost a good customer."}
{"text":"We got the 14 minutes or it's free deal, and boy, do they make sure the food gets to you in under 14 minutes, even if it means the hamburger is bloody & the salad looks like it's been sitting in the back of the fridge for 2 weeks. They didn't charge us for our food, thank goodness, but I won't go back there to that location or ask for that deal again."}
{"text":"Awful! Food was heat lamp dried out. Ticket time was over 30 mins. Manager didn't care. 20 mins to sit down when there was several empty tables.... We went last year and it was awful too. Never ever again. I can have much better service and quality food for the same price at many other establishments. My husband and I had horrific stomach aches shortly after eating here too. :s"}
{"text":"The service was acceptable so that's why I'm leaving at least 2 stars. But I didn't really appreciate the screaming at the back of the house. I heard people arguing from the kitchen to the front of the restaurant. This is unacceptable please fix this Applebee's. Thank you."}
{"text":"Date night with my husband , I really wanted to go to Chevys.. But my husband had neck surgery last week and we decided the drive was to long ..So Applebee's here we come with a full Bar , I had the grilled mesquite chicken with shrimp and potato wedges.. The chicken was okay a 3 star on the food. My husband asked for rare steak and it was well done , but he's pretty passive And  will eat anything  The drinks were awesome with plenty of alcohol . Drinks 5 stars  The Double  fudge brownie, with ice cream and hot fudge was far the best thing they have 5 stars .. Our Waitress Maria , was very nice and aways checked on us great jod on the service 5 stars  Wil we return YES !! But next time I'll stick with the ribs"}
{"text":"Volodmyrs best waiter at Applebee's. We had 12 people in our party and he was awesome. He didn't mess up any of our orders everything was perfect. We ordered a variety of burgers, chicken, shrimp and pasta. The food was fantastic and came out in a timely fashion. This Applebee's was extremely clean and organized."}
{"text":"Most disappointing meals ever. Beef brisket chimichanga looked like something out of a frozen dinner. The beef was chopped up little hard pellets..The corn wrap was just a soggy mess... The quesidilla burger was under cooked...The server was not the most attentive person...Made the decision to just pay the check and leave...love Applebee's thought maybe we had entered an alternative bad Applebee's world...Sad"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times and had a good experience. This visit , had a new server, Zach, best service in a long time.  He made sure we had everything we needed , and answered any questions we had. Top of the line service to start the week."}
{"text":"We had great service, and really good food. Went for lunch, and Ceyda was our server. Super nice, and came back many times to see if we needed anything.   Each of us had the Pick N Pair. The salads and sandwiches we chose were great. Fresh ingredients, and everything was at the perfect temperature."}
{"text":"I have not been to Applebee's in a while, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the service here. When we walked in I saw those little computer contraptions on the tables, and inwardly groaned. They can be confusing, annoying and they are not personal at all.   However, we had an amazing waiter...but we cannot agree on his name. He spoke so quickly, and we both remember him introducing himself differently. So, he was either named Juan or Julio and was extremely friendly and outgoing.   We came here especially for the 2 for $20 deal and saw they also have a 2 for $25. My husband spotted something on the 2/$25 menu and we went from there. We decided to get the onion rings, which came out HOT and with BBQ sauce on the side. The sauce they have is tangy and flavorful. Rings were nice and crispy.   He got the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp, and it came out on a hot skillet, still sizzling. I stole one of the potatoes, and it was really good. He was very happy with his meal, and it looked wonderful. I had been looking the Chinese chicken salad, but he convinced me to get the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders. When it arrived, it was a lot of food. Three tenders, and tons of gooey cheesy pasta with some bacon throughout. It was pretty good, but a few bites in and I realized that it was very rich and very heavy. I should have stuck with that salad...or what my husband got. Next time I know better!  Now we did use the little computer at the table to pay. BE AWARE though, that it will tempt you to play games on it, and almost sucked us in when a trivia question popped up. Just know that these cost extra, and will be added to your bill. Anyway, we used it to pay and it gives the option of splitting the check. That part was nice. You could even choose which items go onto which check. This is great for groups of people. Otherwise, it is kind of impersonal. But we like to finish our meal, pay and leave. Like this evening, we had a meeting we had to attend.   Overall, we really enjoyed this Applebee's, and will be back again."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here on Thanksgiving Day!   Food: Good! I ordered the Loaded Brisket Enchiladas, and was not disappointed. They were very flavorful, just the right amount of food. The rice was ok, nothing special.  Cost: Reasonable: $10 for three enchiladas and rice.  Service:  Very good. Everyone we met was friendly and cheerful, from the \"greeter\" who opened the door to our server, to the manager who stopped by to make sure we were happy. It took us a few minutes to decide what to order. Once we did, the food came out fairly quickly. Impressive, since this was Thanksgiving Day. The server was attentive the whole time.  Atmosphere: Ok, it's an Applebees. What else can I say?  :-)    Overall: A good experience, certainly different than many of the reviews of this place!"}
{"text":"Only stars are for the taste of the food, which was great. Maple bacon sweet potato mash-- out of this world. Service, horrific. Waiter rushed us to order. Other people brought the app. Other people brought the drinks. Other other brought the entrees. Other people brought the check. Never was offered the \"perfect margarita\" or the gift card-- both which seemed a free appetizer or gift card if not offered. Took 15 minutes to drop off to go boxes. Empty wine and beer sat on the table for quite, and no one came to ask if we wanted anything else. After 15 minutes more with no food, no boxes, no drinks, no check- we finally flagged for a check to leave and drink elsewhere. I left a 18% tip but wasn't happy about it. Our waiter took our order and that was it. Will not return."}
{"text":"So just bc this place is not busy should not mean that the waitstaff should ignore the customers.  Then all of a sudden it talked two people to bring ur food out."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, sat at a high top table by the bar. Host was not very personable, but we gave it a chance. Wrong idea. We waited 15 min, not even a greet or anything. We seen all sorts of servers walk by our table, ignoring us. After waiting, we got up and left. All the host said was \"leaving already?\" Really?! He said it in a tone as if he wanted to know if the table was now 'available'. Will never I back. I am not the biggest fan of Applebee's, and this just sealed the deal. Get it together people."}
{"text":"As a whole this company has really done a great job at restructuring their food selection. We stopped going to Applebee's years ago due to the always bland and over microwaved food. No this won't be your glorious date night location that has you talking about the marvelous chef selections, but you will get a decent family meal for a decent price.  Servers have been good every time we have gone. Food prep and delivery is also acceptable."}
{"text":"Food is food just like any other Applebee's. The service here can be hit or miss. We have gotten prompt service with a friendly smile, but also a ghost server with cold food delivery. I don't suggest this place during busy times as that is when it tends to bring out the poorer service."}
{"text":"Applebee's has lost their way! We had dinner there last night...What a huge disappointment ! The service was awful... My hamburger was ordered pink it was gray! They forgot my daughters salad... They made a reference to my mother in laws bake potato they were going to serve her was rotten so it would be a few minutes to bring a fresh one.  Please avoid this Applebee's at all cost  I will Never return there again and warn everyone I know to do the same."}
{"text":"I went in with sorta low expectations.  I can't say that anything was bad but I also can't say that anything was amazingly great.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer.  It was decent.  I got a half-rack of baby back ribs as my meal.  They were decent.  The service was okay.  The place looked clean enough.  The price was fair.  The atmosphere was slightly loud.   No real complaints.  The best takeaway from the night was the spinach dip."}
{"text":"I'm not one for chain restaurants, but on a Monday weeknight after 10pm, you're choices are limited. This is why we decided to go to Applebee's. I never really had an issue with them before, but I'd just rather spend my money somewhere local instead.   Service was shaky. Our waitress was nice, but seemed a little nervous. Maybe she was new? There also weren't many tables and it seemed to take her quite some time to check on us and refill.   The food is where the two stars come from. We ordered tacos as an appetizer. No problems there. My boyfriend and I both ordered the steak. Now, granted, its Applebees steak, but it was very gummy tasting. Texture was strange. I ordered a baked potato which wasn't even warm and fully cooked (I noticed another table had the same issue) and garlic green beans that were lukewarm and soggy. My boyfriend wasn't impressed with his sides either.   I will say, you get lots of food for the price. An appetizer, two salads, four sides, two steaks and a beer came to be around $45 after tip. Then again, I guess you get what you paid for. Needless to say, I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was at Applebee's tonight. They made our food wrong and rebrought it poorly made. We now all suffer from terrible gas. I bet starving children in Ethiopia get better food than what I experienced tonight."}
{"text":"The food has to be prepackaged. There is nothing fresh about any of the food. Even the drinks seem to be prepackaged. It's gross and way to commercialized. I won't waste my money here ever again"}
{"text":"This Applebees has horrible service, had a drink waitress took our order like 3 times; manager took our drink orders and still we waited for over 45 minutes for drinks, finally we get our drinks, we order food, and we get our bill, we were charged for alcohol drinks as many times as they took the order... Bad service including management."}
{"text":"Food was okay came out cold each time. The price for sweet potato fries was way to high for the small amount I got. Our waitress ivy disappeared when we were trying to leave. Overall not that awesome."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today to get the are you can eat soup and salad only got one soup one salad the service sucked so bad I could even get a refill and then my friend got a steak altogether the bill was about 30 bucks not worth it Manager sucks server was OK. Just overwhelmed I will never go here for lunch again"}
{"text":"Dollar margaritas is what got the group in, but the great service (plus mediocre to satisfactory food) is why it's A-OK in my book. Mike (working at the bar) was super responsive and efficient when over 20 of us pedaled into the restaurant from a late evening bicycle ride. He doled out our drinks for the entire party at once, took our orders, split our checks and didn't disappoint in any part of his service. As for the late night happy hour food, the nachos were a bit too soggy and spicy for my tastes, but the boneless chicken wings were as expected."}
{"text":"Why are the employees permitted to order Jimmy Johns delivery & then sit in the dining room &eat it?   Not to mention,  they are ignoring their customers while doing so!  This would never be allowed at most other establishments!  Our food & service was great!   We just thought this was a major conflict of interest! !"}
{"text":"IMy family and I came in this evening for a relaxing dinner out. It is a rare occasion that we can pin the kids down long enough, in the same place, to eat out. Normally we see each other in passing.       When we came in & the place was hoppin. They had several Friday night birthdays and parties keeping the staff very busy. When our server Jeff L. came to our table we were met with a kind spirit and charming smile. Nothing is more inviting than an uplifting spirit greeting you. I immediately knew we would have a great experience.      I appreciate a server that never allows a glass to be empty and an eye for serving details, I.E. extra napkins, straws, and all of the  place settings etc. Jeff was moving and shaking  and not once did that glowing smile and effervescent attitude falter.       We had a food set back with one entree being missed in the back and not coming out right away, however, this staff redeemed that. We were not upset, like I said relaxed night for us, but the front manager, and I believe the kitchen manager, came over to apologize and ensure our satisfaction.        I also, appreciate their care and concern. These behaviors are lacking in many businesses these days, but not this location. I cannot say enough about how wonderful these folks are. Request Jeff for a 5 star experience. Jeff and management we want to thank you for making us feel like you worked at a Michelin 3 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Service seriously lacks, just straight up laziness. Food is mediocre. When we ordered food and picked it up, curbside, no one paid attention to us or the other cars around us. When we got home, the brownie we ordered looked like 1) someone had cut a piece off for themselves before putting it in the container and 2) it had been left out for a long time. Also the disappointing amount of ice cream was melted in the 2 minutes it took us to get home because the To Go server put the hot food on top of the dessert container... common sense people... We won't be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"This was my first time to an Applebee's. I had a bunless burger and a salad and both were delicious! The lady came back multiple times to check on is and keep refilling the water. Overall great experience and if back in that area I'd give them another try!"}
{"text":"This location has had issues that have come and gone . When your waiter doesn't know the difference between  doughy and soft.   The pretzels have not been done twice ( hey give the place another shot) .   When things aren't completely cooked it's it necessarily safe .    There are  little to no stuff actually working and the place is packed . It's frustrating to put money into an establishment in which you are unable to get a meal in a reasonable time ."}
{"text":"I am not going to say this was the best experience I have ever had here, however the most entertaining. Our server Chris was awesome and the food came out great.  The entertainment came from the the 20+ top next to us, the entire table was polite with the exception of one blondish/greyish lady in her early 60s. She was so incredibly rude to the server, we took it upon ourselves to let the GM know the server for the table was doing a great job. I have never apologized for another table! Well this lady was upset because she couldn't get her booze fast enough. A joke. I will say management handled this table and the drunk one very well. My hats off, for sure. I personally would have kicked her and her kid out. I did take a picture of the rude one but decided not to post it, they know who they are.  In the end: food was great, party next to us not so much"}
{"text":"The food here is decent, service has always been good. However, their car side to go is seriously lacking. We arrived home to find sides of meals missing, and the quantity of food was much smaller than what you get when actually eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place needs to close.  Half the waitresses are tweekers with missing teeth.  Our server must have have been on meth, she messed up the entire order.  I talked to the manager, Javier, about the service, and he said \"what do you want me to do about it?\"  This Applebees has seen better days."}
{"text":"All 3 of us had hamburgers and everyone thought the meat was delicious and tasty, burgers well worth the money.  Service on the other hand was horrid at best.  To many tables to serve and probably pretty new at waiting tables.  And the place felt dirty, carpet looked like a mechanic did a oil change on it,  Would go back again just to see if service gets better."}
{"text":"Service was particularly bad on 5/11 when I went. I ordered water, waitress asked if I wanted lemon, I said yes but they never came even after reminding her twice. Food took a long time to come out and when it finally did, mine was dropped on the floor before it made it to the table. The waitress was kind enough to \"have them make it over\" (as if there were another option). Waitress also worked behind the bar so instead of coming to our table and asking if we needed anything, she just yelled it from the bar which was odd. The icing on the cake was my boss checking her credit card statement the next day and finding an additional $5 on her payment. She called and asked where it came from and a manager informed her that there was a $5 fee for using the \"pay at the table\" system because they charge for the software. This isn't labeled anywhere in the restaurant or on the system so the charge is basically a secret until you check your account balance. Annoying at the least, but also unprofessional. After too many bad experiences, I'm calling it quits. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Only went cause friends invited.   Next time I will politly tell friends they are on there own.   Seriously, Realy how hard is it to cook a steak MEDIUM WELL, for them impossible.    Steak came out RARE they took back and cooked more, still not done.   Thanks for reinforcing your nickname CRAPPLEBEES!  You guys are not worth my money anymore, what a JOKE.   Good For:   NOTHING"}
{"text":"Why cant I give this place zero stars!! it was a bad experience right from the beginning. we were sat at our table and waited a good 15 to 20 minutes before somebody came over to talk to us (they weren't even that busy). that was too long and we even had the little machine blinking meaning we needed service. after somebody came over, we ordered the dollar long islands which were disgusting, then finally we asked if we could have some water since it wasn't offered. after that we had a long wait for our food which wasn't even that great, the menu made it sound better than it was. A person at my table ordered steak and it took the cook 3....3! tries to cook the steak to medium which took forever they just got it to go. we asked for the manager to come over atleast  4 times.. then finally somebody else called him over and which he was basically giving us excuses to what was going on. The only plus was he compt the steak and nasty drinks... Most def wont be coming back, ever!"}
{"text":"So, as we were headed out of town, we decided to stop at a local Applebee's for lunch since we had a gift card.  The first indication that this wouldn't be the best lunch was that every single location had less than three stars...uh oh.  Well, somebody spent the $$ on the gift card, so I guess we might as well use it, right?  We were seated right away and our server was friendly.  I ordered an unsweetened raspberry iced tea and it was pretty good.  We checked out the lunch menu and the prices were decent; $6.99, $7.99, or $8.99, depending on what you ordered.  The hubs and I both ordered the Caesar salad with the new \"spicy\" fire roasted chicken salad wrap.  Big mistake.  First of all, the salad was basically like one of those prepackaged salads that has been sitting out for awhile.  The lettuce was soggy and warm.  Now here's the menu description of the wrap, \"Grilled¬†diced¬†chicken, creamy sriracha sauce,¬†fire roasted¬†vegetables, lettuce and a squeeze of fresh lime juice served in a¬†grilled¬†Italian Flatbread\" and there was a spicy sign next to it.  There was nothing spicy about this wrap.  In fact, there was no flavor whatsoever.  Fire roasted vegetables?  How about more wilted lettuce?  We both decided that the reason all locations had such low ratings is because they just don't care what they are serving their customers.  Based on the food, they barely deserve one star but I'll add another for the low prices and good service.  Luckily, our gift card covered both of our meals and the tip.  Now let's just hope I make it to Vegas without having to stop for a restroom every five miles..."}
{"text":"It's Applebee's and they don't dissapoint.  Every few years I forget how horrific this chain is and step into one.  After eating here I feel my soul being pulled out of my body and all that is happy and good in the world go away and I need a nap.  How they can consistently have food that is tasteles, seasonless, and devoid of any characterisitcs of actual meat products is beyond comprehension.  Only if you're starving....even then think twice."}
{"text":"Wasn't great but it hit the spot. Meaning all I had was a side salad! Ordered a tea and it took awhile to get that! The menu was hard to find the side salad - must have looked for it through the menu 3-4 times before I found it. Wasn't wanting their soup and salad all you can eat. It came out fairly reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Tried the Thia chicken salad - it was good portion little small some spicy. Service lacked though waiter was friendly.  While not my worse visit to any Restaruant it just fell into so-so! Only ate here because I was in the area. Wouldn't make it a must destination - maybe again if in the area."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite places to go in High School (also one of the only places). Definitely one of my favs and brings back memories. The server, Brook, is awesome. He's super friendly and has always been so welcoming"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's just me but I've never had good food and service at an Applebee's. I rarely go here for that reason plus their food is mediocre for what you pay.  I think today was my last time voluntarily eating at an Applebee's. I love you blondie but I just can't anymore. My three cheese chicken pasta had lettuce in it. I'm not allergic to lettuce or anything but I don't like it. It is really gross biting into a crunchy piece of lettuce totally unexpected and it also doesn't mix well with pasta FYI.  There were about 3 pieces. It just makes me wonder what the heck is going on in the kitchen ya know?  I did eat a little over half of it when I came upon the lettuce pieces I told my waitress and I would have liked another one made at the very least. At that point I was ready to leave so I didn't bother making a fuss over it. I really wasn't that surprised since it's not the first time my dish has been messed up at an Applebee's.   I didn't even take my leftovers because of the lettuce so I do feel a little gypped."}
{"text":"First visit here, the service was great and the server Felicia was very friendly and attentive.  Tables and lobby were clean, but the ladies room could use some work.  The food came out in a timely fashion the way we ordered it.  I had the peppercorn steak with grains from the lighter fare menu and Ben had a 6 oz sirloin.  Mine didn't look exactly like the picture so I was worried, however it tasted wonderful and Felicia took the time to answer questions about the types of grains in the dish. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have frequented many a fabulous Applebee's across the country and have always been fascinated by their ability to offer very good food, great atmosphere and some of the best service of any chain eatery around.  Something really wrong seems to have happened at this location. Food was just okay, and the service atrocious.  With multiple tables clear and available we were told there was a twenty minute wait.  When asking about the tables that were clean and clear, we were told they were reserved - at Applebee's? Another family ahead of us, made the decision to go next door to IHOP!  We eventually did something we've never done before, we confiscated one of the various empty tables.  By the time dinner came around, we found the servings were adequate, but the taste and apparent quality of our fare was less than noteworthy!  At this visit we tried the Club Grill Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries which was nothing to write home about, and the Fish & Chips with French Fries.  As a traditional Fish & Chips lover, and often ordered at Applebee's, I found the fish and its batter was considerably bland, unlike many others I've enjoyed over the years in many another Applebee's.  Although the server was nice and very apologetic for the inconvenience, and the on duty manager also apologized, we found the incident very discomforting and aggravating to experience from what usually has been a favorite. Hopefully this a one-off incident, but it may take a long time before I frequent this Applebee's again. Consommateurs d'√™tre prudents."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was nice, and the service was pretty okay (they were fantastic at keeping drinks refilled!), but the food was a complete bust. The mozzarella sticks were bland and the sauce was a really weird flavor. The spinach and artichoke dip was ATROCIOUS, had no texture, and tasted like broccoli. I ordered the fiesta lime chicken, and it was a reheated nightmare. The sauce on the chicken was too salty, and the melted cheese had hardened on top of the chicken. The only thing that made it lime chicken was the tiny slice of lime on the side. I also could have done without the huge nest of soggy chips underneath the chicken, which was the majority of the dish.  The Spanish rice was also dry, looked old, and was pretty bland.  Overall, it was a disappointment, and it's a good thing we had a giftcard, otherwise I would not have wanted to pay for this."}
{"text":"I came here because a girlfriend of mine wanted to get drinks after work. I haven't been to an Applebee's in such a long time. I was surprised at just how tasty the drinks were. Ok. Fine. I had a burger and fries too. Stop judging me! That was pretty good too. For being a chain restaurant, I have no complaints. The service was fast and friendly. Made for a really good experience."}
{"text":"Went there last night and lets say, they used to be better.  Maybe it is the location as the one on GIlbert and Baseline is a LOT BETTER.  Service Staff - I give an A+.  The service was really good.  Waiting to get entrees, D-.  The appetizers came out quickly and it seemed it took LONGER for our actual food.  Portions - it is amazing how much SMALLER they are getting.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip is at least 2 to 3 oz smaller over the years, or it seems.  This time it looked a little over cooked and blackened around the corners like it was OVER cooked in the microwave.  The Caesar Salads, WAY TOO MUCH DRESSING.  There was MORE DRESSING than salad.   The steak, this time, WAS TOUGH AND CHEWY.  At least they had A-1.  My wife has Chicken and Shrimp which, lets say didn't sit well.  My daughters, a little better with the pasta and fiesta lime chicken.  If you want a steak, GO TO A STEAK HOUSE.  At least you know it will be A LOT BETTER THAN THIS PLACE.    Do I plan on going back, NOT ANY TIME SOON."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! My fianc√©e and two children went to have dinner last night at this Applebees, it was our first and last time there!! There server didn't introduce herself I still don't know her name!! Not to mention we waited a good 6 to 8 minutes before even being talked to!! She approached our table and asked us what we wanted to drink while taking my kids orders she became very impatient and rolled her eyes when my son was undecided about what he wanted!! Mind you my children are 11 and 8 it wasn't as if I was allowing a toddler to order his own drink!! Right after getting out drink orders she immediately asked what we were eating!! Again rolling her eyes and being very visibly annoyed with my children as they ordered!! We ordered everything at once (drinks appetizers and entrees) to make it easy and because we sat so long we knew what we wanted!! When our server brought us out drinks she brought me the wrong drink I didn't say anything and just dealt with it!! We didn't see the server again until our appetizers came out!! She brought us steak wonton tacos with no side plates!! Not once did she check on us after dropping the tacos!! Mind you we need refills side plates and extra napkins!! We asked another server and got our refills and plates!! Our food arrived shortly after and the host who brought us out food handed my 8 year a heavy plate causing him to almost drop a hot bowl of Mac and cheese all down the front of him and again we sat and waited for things we needed!! The sauce that was forgotten and eventually a refill on our plates!! (We ordered the all you can eat special)After looking right at us and my fianc√©e trying to get her attention and her turning her head I asked to speak to a manager!! The manager Michelle came over I explained to her what was wrong and requested a new server!! Michelle apologized and got us what we needed including a new server!! Ok all could have been forgiven had my next plate of food not have come out cold and the wrong flavor!!  The new server was really nice but almost seemed to be annoyed that she had to pick up another table that wasn't hers!! And not to mention we only saw her twice once to introduce herself and again to drop off our check which of course was wrong as well!! The appetizer we ordered was suppose to be half off but wasn't discounted on our check!! We didn't even bother talking to the manager again as she was all over the place and the restaurant was a mess!! We could hear other guests complaining about the same server and the horrible service!! Although Michelle was very kind and said sorry she also kept saying it's busy!! Like duh it's Friday night of course it's busy!! Being a server myself I was disappointed that Michelle the manager didn't do the little extra to help make us happy!! Maybe follow up with us or sense she was sooo busy maybe offered us dessert!! We would have even paid for the dessert we were never offered?! After switching servers I feel like we became a problem and the focus was to get us out other then making us happy!! I felt very uncomfortable and will NEVER be returning to this restaurant again!!!"}
{"text":"Could've been better but overall just ok.  We ordered the queso blanco cheese dip which was mediocre.  We also ordered the pretzels with beer cheese and that was amazing.  My husband had the fish and fries and said that the oil they used to deep fry them tasted old.  I ordered the Mac and cheese with the chicken strips on top and was disappointed.  The bacon was very fatty and the chicken was over cooked.  Probably will only go back for appetizers."}
{"text":"Applebee's is a place you go for cheap drinks and happy hour. The food is ok. They do not have any vegetarian options except fried mozzarella sticks or French fries. No actual food. I come here to drink for cheap and maybe eat a fried cheese stick or two."}
{"text":"I just got a club sandwich from Applebee's in penn center. Bread was soggy from the mayo they put  on it   The turkey  had an after taste that I can't even describe.  They definitely won't see me again"}
{"text":"I was hungry and needed a snack - so I walked over from the Courtyard next door and sat at the Bar.  Ordered their chips and queso cheese offering. Was hoping for something more like Nachos - but Oh well!  The food comes out as a basket of chips with a queso serving and some salsa. There was not enough queso to go with the amount of chips they serve you.  I did note they had Rebel IPA on tap - which is about as close to offering a good craft beer as they get.  Service was very good - even if the food offerings were rather meh."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, AMAZING Bahama Mama drink! The drink is delicious and only $3 all day, every day!"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour! Cheap beers and appz.. can't go wrong with a tall stella and some boneless honey bbq wings!"}
{"text":"I have been in here numerous times and every time seems to get worse. I was there a couple months ago and got some boneless wings. I had to send them back not once or twice but THREE times because they were cold. Even on the third try they were cold but I didnt bother complaining about it again.   The service is slow, the servers never seem to actually care about how your meal is going and the food is never right. It's pretty ridiculous.   I try to avoid this place as much as possible."}
{"text":"I have been to this Applebees many times but the last two times have made me decide that I'm not going there again. The first of the two visits they sat my family very quickly. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally after 10 minutes the manager asked us if our waiter had gotten our drinks. We told her that we haven't even talked to the waiter and had no clue who he was. She took our order. After that the waiter did come and apologize saying he didn't realize we were his table. The second time we waited AGAIN for our drink order and this waitress was horrible. We kept having to find her for everything-placing our orders, refills, even the bill. I doubt I will go this location again."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat at Applebee's anymore just because I found more upscale places that I enjoy going to. But at the time I got off work, and it being Friday evening, I didn't think I would get a spot at the bar at my other go to places so I decided on Applebees. I was greeted right away by the hostess. I was able to snag a seat at the bar. The server / bartender, DJ was great. She got my drink order as soon as I sat down. She engaged in small talk with me and the other customers at the bar. My food came out quickly and it was delicious. I normally skip out on Applebees, but who knows, this might be my last minute go to spot for a quick drink at the bar. Only if DJ was behind the bar.   Thanks DJ for the great service!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here (the chain) a lot (esp. in my 20s), but our most recent visit was a takeout order of their famous 2 for $20 deal (a couple weeks ago). We had a (christmas) gift card burning a hole in our pockets, so we chose boneless chicken wings came with blue cheese and ranch (good amount of zest, but kinda messy)- our appetizer to share, riblets (tender, fall off the bone)- for my husband, and fiesta lime chicken (good flavor), with rice pilaf, and shredded tortilla chips (nice touch)- for me. It was a $25 gift card, so there was a couple dollars left. It's a good value, overall- the 2 for $20 deal. Everything was really good. No complaints. My husband finished his entree. I think that the restaurant chain is along the same lines as Chili's (go here the least out of the three) and TGIF, so it's dependable.  This particular location is not inside the Boulevard Mall, but in the corner of the parking lot sharing Sears Auto Center, facing Maryland Parkway. Some years ago, the chain underwent a makeover with rusty red paint (it's very bright and hard to miss). The inside is part kitsch and part memorabilia (much like TGIF). Very popular spot for lunch, esp. the weekends."}
{"text":"Ok, with all the advertisement and commercials on tv, I've wanted to try Applebees for awhile.   When we walked into the restaurant, it wasn't crowded at all. The bar had. a couple of people and only a couple of tables were filled.   First of all, service was very slow. It wasn't busy so I couldn't figure that one out. Secondly, I thought it was a little odd that our waitress kept sitting down at a table diagonal to our where a baby and man were eating periodically. Later, I realized that must have been her baby and significant other. Even if the restaurant was slow, I thought that was unprofessional.   We got the meal deal for $20 that came with an appetizer and two meals.  The mozzarella sticks appetizer was pretty good but just like any other place. I got steak which I asked for medium rare and it was cooked well the steak was pretty chewy. My companion had some pasta dish that wasn't so good.   So overall, price was about the only thing that was good. It kind of reminded me of chili's but I thought Chili's back home in Hawaii was better. it seems like it would be a good family place. But I definitely was disappointed.  ^_^*~"}
{"text":"It's Applebee's. I'm not a huge fan of this place, but stopped by for lunch with my coworkers. The three cheese macaroni was a decent 3/5.   The teriyaki shrimp and vegetable stir fry looked legit in the photo, but tasted like a lean cuisine meal that I've bought for $1.50.  The surprise item were the garlic fries. It was really delicious and I'd actually come back just to eat it. It was quite garlicky in a good way."}
{"text":"The only reason this location even gets 2 stars is because its the only place to get a beer at steelyard and they have a good happy hr.  The bartenders put their cigarettes on the ledge behind bar and take frequent smoke breaks.  Also I have seen the one guy touch the trashcan with the lid of the blender (after he made some weird blender drink) then reuse said lid on another drink without washing.  I question his cleanliness. The staff is all around a little ghetto.  I actually have called and complained about this to no avail..   Its a shame the location (inner city) has to reflect in the staff.."}
{"text":"Worst dried out wings I've ever had. The waitress was SUPER slow even though the place had less than 4 tables of people. The food took forever to get to our tables. The fries were undercooked. The waitress was SO slow. I don't understand why because there were hardly any other people. But hey you can't expect much for 50 cents a wing right? Also the drink prices were very decent so I am leaving a 2 star rating for how cheap everything was. Otherwise the service and food were garbage."}
{"text":"This place has been horrible. Sitting here still waiting for our waitress for 35 minutes just to order dessert not to mention when we sat down 25 min for silverware.  I tried very hard to give this place a chance. But this is horrible. I asked to speak to a manager and they even sent her to the wrong table. Still haven't talked to a manager as I'm writing this review. Horrible horrible horrible!"}
{"text":"So, long wait for food. It wasn't bad but they can do better. The atmosphere is ok, basic neighborhood grill."}
{"text":"Happy hour is pretty sweet. Half price all apps and some beers. The servers aren't the best. The lady we had was sweating and smelled like cigarettes."}
{"text":"It's really hard to rate this... Nathan the bartender was really nice and professional but I'm assuming who would be the manager was very rude and unprofessional yelling at employees in front of customers.  Made me really uncomfortable.  My food was great Nathan was great but John the Manager you should never talk to people that way let alone in front of others."}
{"text":"I loved the food. It was busy but the food was quick. Trent W. Was amazing and really kind. I made sure to even do the survey on the receipt. He checked on my family and me and kept our drinks filled. I gave four stars not because of the staff but the desserts. When ordering on the tablets no nuts is not an option. And the hot fudge shooters had less than 1/4 tsp. Of hot fudge. My family and I were amazed at that. I thank Trent for his kindness and making our dinner experience the best he could."}
{"text":"Food and service was the worse then last time, I know I'll never eat there ever. First it took 15 minutes to be seated even though it was only about ten people in the whole place. Second what server bring out the food before giving you utensils? Food had no flavor"}
{"text":"Last time I was there, the service was poor and the AC was broken and could not be shut off.  The back section of the restaurant was probably 55-60 degrees."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here multiple times. Its always togo which is great for me. Anyways the food and service is delicious. The people are so nice and my food is always on point! I usually get a 8oz top sirloin with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I never fails. Our second fave is the Bourbon chicken and shrimp. Its so juicy and tasty. I just wish wish i could take a picture before i devour all my food"}
{"text":"Some of the best french onion soup i ever had!!! Seriously! Its a must try. This time for some reason he put a glob of cheese in the middle instead of on top of my bread, which i may add i wasn't very fond of. But it was still \"da bomb\"! I ordered my usual 8oz steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I asked medium but got medium well. Also got the bourbon chicken and shrimp. Excellent as always. A little dry, but i did heat it up. All in all my sever was really sweet and i would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was 9:05pm on a Wednesday night... like 5 tables were filled. We waited a few minutes to be seated, then 12 minutes for our server to ask for our drinks. A few minutes before that I heard 2 of them talking and saying, whose table is that? Then, nothing. We ordered our food after waiting another 5 minutes for our waters. The waitress seemed aloof, and maybe it was because she was also a bartender, but I dont care, be cordial you douche bag!  While we were ordering our drinks, 2 dudebros came in and sat at the bar. The blonde bartender immediately got on their jock and started flirting with them, waiting hand and foot.  My son wanted some more juice, but our server was who knows where. Probably telling the dumb blonde bartender how to make a paradise iced tea... idiot.   So by now we have been waiting 35 minutes for our food........ GUESS WHAT! The 2 douche bags, I mean dudebros get their food delivered to them.... BY THE FLOOR MANAGER! I was aghast! I was like, seriously? I waited a few more moments and nothing. I got up and told the kpop hostess we had to leave otherwise I was going to make a fool of myself. She offered to speak to manager and I declined because I was pissed.  I ended up calling in a few minutes later and spoke to Christy, or Kristine, she claimed she was the Manager. I gave her a quick run down and she seemed like she could give 2 fooks. She said she would discuss it with the server aka probably o take a dump and forget what I'm complaining about. After a few minutes, she said \"well you're more than welcome to come back and your apps will be on me\" I didn't order JUST apps your mongrel! Besides, I was gone and didn't trust them. I hung up and was done. She didn't even ask for my name, so if anyone reads this, just tell them they owe you some free food from your horrible encounter and you spoke to blonde manager kristy or whatever her name was."}
{"text":"This Applebees has seriously surpassed my expectations! Not only is the customer service here excellent, but the food itself is prepared perfectly! No hard nasty green beans, no overcooked and dry chicken breast, and Martha in the carside to go is seriously an asset to this location, and company!  I come here for lunch and order carside to go; I get one large chicken breast, a side of green beans, and a side of crispy red potatoes. With tax it's just at 8$, AMAZING! The breast is cooked thoroughly and does not have a knife mark (cook knows how to prepare and how much time if he doesn't even have to check!) the green beans are cooked perfectly and seasoned like its nobody's business and the potatoes are just the right amount of crispy! PERFECT!!  Now, I've only tried the chicken dishes, but they never fail me! The inside is super clean and spacious, and the wait staff is always attentive and a pleasure to be around. The food is cooked quickly and hot when it's brought out.   Call ahead about 15mins and your food will be ready for you in the carside to go!!  YAY!"}
{"text":"This might have been a three if the entire experience matched up to the prices on their menu. But it doesn't. Applebee's is not an in expensive place to eat. They're fairly pricey. And for that high price our silverware Service included a single fork each and a single thin paper napkin each. Really Applebee's? You can't give me a knife fork and spoon? And more than one see-through napkin? I did ask for a knife and he did bring one but he wanted to know for each of us individually... really? And nice of you to have a catchup bottle on the table too bad it was empty and we had to walk halfway across the restaurant to get another one.  The food was OK. The service was OK. But I think it's unacceptable to pay $14 for fish and chips and then not get a full set of silverware, more than one napkin and a catchup bottle with catchup actually in it.  And really... Just keep my water glass full.  If we had depression era shortages I get it but you're charging an arm and a leg and I should not have to ask for every single scrap of anything in the restaurant...."}
{"text":"Overall experience last night was good. Had a great seat on their small patio with some wonderful weather, good company, refreshing drinks and satisfying food with a free appetizer for checking in... Bonus!   Can't complain when they offer a complimentary appetizer with pleasant staff and quick food service.  Manager came out to say hello, server was really nice and was on top of things.   Haven't been to Applebee's for years so I was happy to see they still had many of their staple entrees and apps.  I was slightly disappointed with their Pico because it wasn't nearly as fresh as I last remembered... It was mushy and seems like days old... But heh... Still love the Pico taste.  Will be back sooner then later."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for lunch. We have not been to Applebee's for sometime so I thought it would be nice to try in again. The service was good but the food was mediocre. Quality has definitely gone downhill since the last time we went. I was disappointed with the lack of healthy options and salads. We ended up sharing a 2 for 20 meal. He got chicken strips and I tried the riblets with steamed broccoli. I honestly would rather eat McDonalds food over the food we ate that day."}
{"text":"OK,  so it's a chain,  but It's so cozy and comfortable,  great happy hour 2x per day and no gambling.    The food is typical bar food and that's just fine with me.   I'm never displeased by Applebee's,  it's just plain comfortable and friendly and I love that."}
{"text":"Ugh...I've been on a losing streak lately while getting lunch. Tried Applebee's for lunch on Tuesday. I hadn't been to one in years, and figured \"why not\"?  I should have asked myself \"why\"?  Service was pretty good, hence the two stars. They have a \"14 minute guarantee\" so that once you place your order, they guarantee you'll have food in 14 minutes or it's free.  The food was out within that time frame, I assume...I didn't have a stopwatch out but it seemed quick enough. I wish they'd taken longer to make it good. I could put some crappy chicken on a plate at home in under 14 minutes, but I pay someone else to do it in hopes that out will turn out better. It didn't. It was worse. Overcooked boneless wings that were overly breaded and tossed in poorly flavored sauce...Pretty much a swing and a miss all around.   Also overpriced for what you get...It's simply not worth it at all. If you ever find yourself in this \"neighborhood\" (see what I did there?), just drive on by.  I need to find the Applebee's that John Corbett has been going to...Until then I think I'll pass on a second trip to this place."}
{"text":"This Applebee's sucks complete dick. Appetizers came after a good 20/30 mins after we ordered not to mention they were cold, to their defense the manager did come out and bring us our new ones, and said they were on him!! I also ordered the new house drink and I swear it had no alcohol! It tasted like a fucking Sprite. Last time I'll be coming to this location!!"}
{"text":"Took my son to lunch here last weekend.  The food was really good but we waited a long time to have our order taken.  People who were seated after us has their orders taken first.  It was about 3:00pm on a Saturday so it wasn't even that busy.  Not my best lunch expeience.  I even had to ask for my check!!"}
{"text":"Great Service, Margarita  and soup were great...too bad my to go entree was terrible..oh well!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff always super friendly. Food is good. Chicken quesadilla is super friendly. They play good music and have all the college games on :D"}
{"text":"My daughter ask for a fruit bowl instead of fries. The waitress brought over a bowl of fruit wedges from  the bar. 2 pineapple wedges, 2 orange wedges ,2 maraschino cherries, & 2 apple balls , nice"}
{"text":"Worst Applebees ever! No parking unless you want to walk a way. You can't order to go unless you do it on line or are over 21 because you have to order at the bar.. only thing good about this one is they were fast. Next time I'm going to a different Applebees or the Chili's up the street."}
{"text":"I feel that each time I go it gets worse and it really bums me out. This time we came for happy hour and the food was over cooked but burnt on arrival, we ordered items again and the same issue happened. Since we were with kiddos we decided just to eat and leave. I used to love coming here for happy hour but I think it is time to find a new place."}
{"text":"This place seems to go up and down with servers so it is hard to give it a great review.  The food is normal for a chain but for me the service is what matters. We attend this location lots of times because it is close to home. I appreciate the kids menu and the fact that they are kid friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing against this applebees particularly. The company as a whole has gone to hell. They've gotten rid of all their good beers, appetizers and entres. The boneless wings kept going up in price, the beer went up with less selection, thai chicken pizza GONE, jalapeno poppers GONE, onion peels GONE. It's like the people running the company are completely backwards. As a result I have not been back in over a year. Other places have more beer, better prices, and better food. No reason to go back to applebees."}
{"text":"I was skeptical because of the bad reviews at first, but the service was great. The steak was a little too uncooked but I did ask for rare. The server was very friendly as well and the wait wasn't too long."}
{"text":"The music was so loud that the seating host could barely here my request.  I had scheduled a meeting with a client, so I asked for a quiet seat (there are none) or to turn the music down to a level at which people can converse.  Not a chance. So, we left. Garcia's Mexican Restaurant is right around the corner and MUCH more suitable for a business lunch meeting. It isn't surprising that this place is only 2.5 stars.  Is there a manager charge?"}
{"text":"Waited a long long time for our food which, by the time it arrived, was a mass of congealed cheese, soggy fries, and general nasty. The manager was apathetic when we spoke to her and the waiter could not have cared less. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."}
{"text":"The host clearly didn't want to be there, but the waiter was very friendly and attentive to us. Got the new caprese chicken and it was delicious! Place was well staffed and clean."}
{"text":"Someone at Applebee's upped the game.  their cedar salmon and roma tomato sirloin were amazing!"}
{"text":"I sat for almost 10 minutes before my server came to my table. She stomped over like I was interrupting her day. She didn't introduce herself or ask if I was ready she just stood there with a scowl. Then every time she walks by me she glares at me. She smiled and joked with a couple behind me but she super sucks. The lady who greeted me was so nice and so was the lady who brought my food out. But the server is rude, her shirt is filthy, and completely inattentive."}
{"text":"Came in for a date night and to meet up with a friend. We ordered a two drinks each from the bar. I got and crown and diet coke (which was OK) and my \"date\" got the Fireball Whiskey Lemonade (which was really good!)  We started with the double crunch bone in wings. They came out pretty quick so they were probably pre-made, but they were really good!  About 1200 calories per plate, so watch out if your watching your calories. To offset the drinks and appetizers we both ordered from the, \"Have It All\" portion of the menu. I ordered the, \"Pepper Crusted Sirloin\" and he ordered the, \"Napa Chicken\". Both under 500 calories and very flavorful. The server had a large party to attend to, but him and the staff made sure we were not ignored. We were well taken care of, which is always a plus. We definitely would come back to this Applebee's and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I went to this Applebee's for lunch before an afternoon of meetings. We arrived there a little after 11. There were maybe 3 other tables occupied.  We ordered salads, soups, a sandwich and a chicken breast meal.    The waiter was good. However, we had to wait an extremely long time to get our food. We were worried we would be late for our meeting. We actually paid for our food before we got it! We asked the man who sat us if he could check on our food because we were going to be late for our meeting. His response was that he has no control over what time the food will come out. I thought that was a little rude.  When I finally got my Caesar salad the lettuce was warm there were maybe two pieces of chicken on it and hardly any dressing. My friend also didn't have enough dressing for her salad. So we had to ask for more dressing and had to wait another 10 minutes before we got it. The potato soup I got was very good. By the time we left it was 12:15 and we all had to rush to our meeting.  I don't think I'll be going back to Applebees. I was not very happy with the food and the wait and the response I got from the host."}
{"text":"Lately they have been doing a little better. But the last time I was there the server got our order wrong and the hostess was eating the extra entree they brought to our table right next to us, as she was going back and forth catching up on gossip with another server."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar On a Friday night DJ by far the best server I have ever had after a long work week! We will def return :) more then satisfied with our service tonight !"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Applebee's we have ever been to!! We went on a Thursday to celebrate a friends birthday and the bar server was rude! Her name was Tracy. She brought us our drinks 20 after we ordered . Then when we ordered more she said \"why didn't u tell me when I went the first time.\" Then she didn't advise us about the kitchen closing soon. Asking us if we were going to order anything else. She just came up to us and said! Kitchen closed, bar closed. Here is your check. My friend at this point was very disappointed . Her birthday dinner was not going as planned. The service sucked already . Thennnn to top of the shitty service , the server said . Are u done yet because I have to get all the liquor off the tables. And she had bearly brought us our drinks about 10 mins ago. I had said, well u paid for your drink so just finish it. Then she said well I'm giving you 3mins. When she walked away. The manager came up to us and asked if we were leaving yet . Keep in mind that when we go to Applebee's the are very welcoming and they tell us to take our time. But at this location was the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant! WORST! Just cuz the restaurant closes at a certain hour they wanted us out 10 mins later. I felt very unwelcome!  Never again will I go to this Applebee's ! Tracy needs to learn how customer service works. Specially if she is working for tips."}
{"text":"We came here cause we had a gift card and happy hour is till 7 online. We got here and they had a sign that said 6  so no happy hour for us. They also said we couldn't buy a gift card with a gift card which really sucks... cause you get 10 bucks off if you buy a 50 dollar one... they also didn't have fortnite in the game iPad things. Bummer."}
{"text":"Solid 4 -- I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.  Not sure where all the negative reviews come from -- I go once a week for lunch -- have been doing so since it opened.  Great lunch menu with the Pick 'n Pair cards -- sixth lunch is free after you buy five -- 4-cheese mac & cheese with honey pepper chicken is a favorite and their french onion soup is generally pretty awesome.  I always sit at the bar and ALWAYS have tremendous service -- even better when Nicole is there.  She lets you eat and anticipates your needs -- one of the best ever!  Maybe the place falls apart after lunch -- but I just can't see it.  The daytime manager is always there also -- and always stepping in to help out to save time."}
{"text":"Happy hour margaritas were good, but mostly ice Wings were delicious but we got charged full price... Played with the tablet at the table, got charged $2 for a stupid game. What a rip off!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my last 2 visits to this location. Fresh food, Fabulous drinks and a Friendly crew made my time here perfect!"}
{"text":"Food was fast (surprisingly so, in a good way) and fresh. We were greeted and seated as soon as we entered. Michelle, our server, was polite and friendly and took good care of us. When our water had floaties in it she promptly changed them out and she kept an eye on us the whole time. We've been to this location before and had good service and food then too, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  We knew what we were getting ourselves into, going to an Applebee's and whatnot, but what transpired was so ridiculous, I expected Ashton Kutcher (or at least the host of \"How to Catch a Predator\") to pop out and we all LOL about how horrible the experience was.  Instead, I left the restaurant with an empty feeling in my heart, as a wave of sadness washed over me knowing I had just lost two hours of my life inside a low-rate Applebee's.  We were first greeted by a host who didn't greet us. He showed us to our table, set down the menus, and sidled back over to the host stand without making a sound.  In fact, I can't be positive he wasn't a ghost sentenced to life in purgatory as an Applebee's host. However I forgot to check if his feet were floating or walking, so we'll never be sure.  The waitress seemed nice enough, but it soon became evident that this woman was about to have a serious breakdown and that we were about to be her therapists, whether we liked it or not (we didn't).  She came back with our drinks after a bit of a wait saying, \"it's like pulling teeth to get that bartender to make us drinks, we even have to have the manager back there making them too!\".  Very professional.  As she was taking our order, I asked her if she knew whether or not a particular menu item had red dye, as I have an allergy. She was going to check in the kitchen. \"Be right back!\" she said, and we believed her.  Five minutes later, we see her emerge from the kitchen, taking food out to other tables, filling waters, and taking more drink orders to the surly bartender.  She returned to our table in a huff, her response to my red dye inquiry was severely alarming.  \"The chef says there's no way for us to know if it has dye it in or not.  We'd have to go look it up somewhere, so he said you just shouldn't order it.\"  Now I'm not under any sort of delusion that Applebee's is the kind of restaurant where the produce comes in fresh every morning, and the chefs have been trained in the French Alps.  However, I would expect at least *some* transparency, or you know, maybe just go look it up.    As we started to order our food (maybe without red dye, who knows?!), the day started to really fall apart.  First of all they were out of mozzarella sticks.  As we all know, mozzarella sticks are among the top 3 reasons to go to Applebee's, along with $2 long islands and 1/2 priced apps after 10 pm.  The waitress tried to explain to us their newly revamped appetizer menu (albeit without mozzarella sticks) but had no clue what she was talking about.  Somehow she walked away after telling us the particular items we ordered could not come out simultaneously, and whatever was ready first was going to come out.  This came down to me getting my entree before my friends' appetizers came, and my friends' entrees coming out about 45 minutes after everyone else had finished their meal.  Throughout the whole meal, and I use \"meal\" loosely because we had nothing to eat for the majority of the time, we could hear the waitstaff going around to every table apologizing for something.  It was complete disarray.  \"Sorry for the wait, we are so busy!\" (as we're surrounded by empty tables), \"There's a 15 minute wait for drinks, because we only have 1 blender!\" (like, what?)  Not to mention they were spilling drinks, precious 15-minute wait drinks, everywhere.  The manager dumped an smoothie on someone's lap, a waiter spilled a drink all over an empty booth (which the mute host then sat a family at before it was cleaned, and a woman sat directly in the puddle), and another waitress was dribbling Bloody Marys across the restaurant at a rate so fast, you'd have thought it was a scene from Dexter. We were being patient, but other tables weren't as gracious.  One man walked up to the bar to get his table's drinks after they sat untouched for 10 minutes.  That guy was cool: he really tore into the manager for being so unorganized and they had to get another waitress.  We put in an order for another round of drinks, and hunkered down for the extreme wait that was likely to follow.  10 minutes later (we got lucky!) she came back with one too many margaritas.  \"Oh gosh!  You only ordered two of those right? Oh okay... well, this one is on me!\" which was nice enough, except she went on to complain about what a horrible day she was having, and how her whole life was ruined because another waitress made her switch sections.    By the time the final entrees surfaced, we had them boxed up immediately to leave.  It took 30 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time she brought it out, after being there for 2 hours.  The cherry on top was when she took $3 out of her own tips and laid it on the table for the extra margarita. That had to have been one of the most absurd things I'd ever seen.  Couldn't she just take it off our bill? Like we're really going to take your $3 off the table.  Anyway, food was"}
{"text":"Waited WAY to long for everything to come out or to even get a beer refill. We didn't even get our artichoke dip till after our food came out. Even though the food was good we will not be going back due to the service. We even seen 2 different tables walk out because no one had even gone to get their drink orders."}
{"text":"the host was very friendly and warming. however my server Alexis completely forgot about my party after dropping the drinks. my mom sat at the table for 15 minutes without a refill while my sister and i stepped out for a smoke. when we came back inside our salads that we ordered first we're still not at the table nor our appetizers and my moms cup was still empty. after about 10 more minutes of waiting i asked to speak with the manager who seemed to be already prepped to handle \"rowdy guests\" which we are not. so she comes over and i tell her i just feel like my waitress forgot about us or purposely overlooked us. stereotyping at its finest. she felt like we weren't the tipping type and so she decided to give us the crappiest service ever! the manager gave us a new sever Marques & he tried his best to make up for the crappy service however my sisters steak came out dry, and my moms pasta came out bland! my food came out perfect but this place needs an attitude check and a new cook! if you're looking for a job they HAVE to be looking for a cook. SIGNED A SERVER WHO KNOWS HOW THINGS SHOULD BE!"}
{"text":"When you don't get off work until midnight and your clientele are people who have been travelling all day you often find yourself needing a drink (or seven) and something to eat.  I happened to find myself in this position last Friday night and so a co-worker and I decided to stop by to decompress.  We chose Applebee's because its kitchen stayed open until 12:45 and we definitely needed some food.  We got there around 12:30 and felt kind of bad ordering food but the bartender assured us it was no problem at all and that she was happy to do it.  Her name was Mary and she was awesome!  Super friendly, she was joking around with us all night, not to mention she was really attentive too, always making sure we had everything we needed whether it was getting our drink order in before last call or condiments for our food.  As we were walking out a couple other employees wished us a good night and welcomed us to come back again.  I know it's a small gesture but it makes you feel good and I will definitely be returning for my next decompression session (look I made a rhyme!)"}
{"text":"Not much in the way of culinary excellence in Sun City West. This particular Applebee's not only had microwaved crappy food but made me sick. Stay away."}
{"text":"The chicken tortilla soup should be called tortilla soup. It literally had NO chicken in it whatsoever. Not a single piece. Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Totally great experience overall. We had an amazing server named Adyson, he was super attentive and nice. The food actually out fast and was delicious. Never did we have ask for anything because adyson was on top of it! Best customer service from any Applebee's!"}
{"text":"If you love frozen food come here and eat... One star for great customer service and one star for my strawberry lemonade drink .... everything else is tastelessssssss..."}
{"text":"All I have to say is if you do NOT! Enjoy working somewhere please don't work there. People work hard for their money to go out and do things and have a little fun! Not so it can be ruined with a bartenders poor attitude. Another thing is that I'm so disappointed with applebees come on be reason and respect your customers and at least pretend your worried about their safety. There was a drunk person at the bar harassing other people there all in their face and using racial slurs! When does the manager take charge and call authorities and remove this person? Oh wait they would have never don't that because they were too busy pouring the person drink after drink. I'm al for a good time but applebees needs to remember that there's crazy people in this world and a fight could have broken out or even worse. Very disappointed and never going back. And don't recommended anyone to go unless your looking for drama and poor service."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with friends and found out their \"ENTIRE DRAFT BEER SYSTEM\" is frozen or isn't working.  I asked to speak with the manager and he could not explain how this happened or willing to make any special offers on their bottle beer.  It is unusual for this to happen to the second Applebee's on a Saturday night in the past couple of weeks.  If is broke I would recommend offering the clients something special.  Said to say but I won't be back to this location.  They missed out on at least a $100 check plus this bad review."}
{"text":"everything was so quick but we didn't seem rushed. the customer service here is A1 & the server paid a lot of attention to us even w a busy crowd.  my drink was refilled before i even needed one & the food was great as well, although i did ask for no pickles nor onions BUT THATS TOTALLY FINE BC THE SERVERS CUSTOMER SERVICE MADE UP FOR EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"A neighborhood classic, down to earth friendly service without pompous ceremonials. We ordered the Brunch Burger and Honey BBQ Boneless Wings, it was pretty good, I only wish the egg in the burger was a little less cooked; I should have specified. Their Strawberry Margarita is pretty good, and the Chocolate Lava cake a good ending to a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, and I haven't had THAT bad of a visit. I will review my most recent visit.  My husband, friend, and I went for dinner around 6pm. Normally they have a habit of putting us all the way in the back by the bathrooms (because I have a baby with me), or putting us in the back on the other side of the bar where the AC is so cold, you have to wear layers to eat, but this time we were sat towards the middle.   My husband and I had the chips and spinach dip (which was scalding hot when it came out). The chips weren't too salty, I just had an issue with the lava dip that was served. Their motorcycle drink thing (it's blue) was pretty nasty. Tasted like a sour orange and not worth $2. I got the 7oz sirloin steak with shrimp and parmesan cooked medium rare, it came out well done. I also got as a side dish loaded mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The broccoli was steamed a little too long, it didn't have a crunch to it, but the potatoes were pretty yummy. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger cooked medium, it was a hockey puck. My friend just ordered an appetizer and she didn't have a problem with it.   Our waitress was spot on and never let our drinks go empty. She's probably the only reason why I am giving this visit a 3 star rating. I have had better food here before, so I can't totally knock the rating down more than 3 stars. Hopefully I'll have better food the next time I go."}
{"text":"Seriously I came here a couple of nights ago and was surprised at the good service as well as the green goddess wedge salad. The dressing was amazing!!! Fast forward to today, I placed an order online for the salad and a soup while at the gym. I plugged in for it 12:00pm pick up. I arrived around 11:45 and had no problem waking until 12. 12:10 nothing...12:15 he comes out with the receipt to sign and will bring the food out when it's ready. Really? It's soup and a wedge salad. Literally a hunk of lettuce. 12:30 and this is the salad they bring out. No bacon and barely any toppings. I knew my one experience Wednesday night was too good to be true.  Update 9/16- tried again. Again a fail on the curbside to go. Ordered the green goddess wedge and southwest steak and black bean soup. This time when the server brought it out it had only bacon on it. I asked about the bleu cheese and pecans and he asked like I was asking for something that doesn't go on the salad. When I get home I realize the salad has ranch. I called and the manager said I could bring it back or have a gift card mailed. I said I would bring it back but decided to suck it up and eat it. Fast forward to midnight and I'm ready to eat my southwest steak and black bean soup but I notice the steak tastes a lot like chicken. Wait a minute it is chicken and it's not southwest black bean anything. More like some kind of chicken tortilla with rice. I'll be making a trip to Applebee's tomorrow.   If I could take away my one star I would."}
{"text":"It was mediocre at best. Nothing special about any of it. Service was meh.. didn't really see much of our server. She was very engaged with the folks behind us. Which is cool.. at least they had a great time. One of our meals came out wrong, but it was fixed right away. Someone Could've offered up an apology for the mix up instead of telling us, no that's not what you said. Giving 2 stars because we were in and out in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"What terrible service sat for 10 minutes no water no greeting nothing. Walked out just looked at us and said nothing. Wow."}
{"text":"I didn't remember why we didn't come back after our first visit to this Apple B location until now.  It's the service, it's super slow.   I'll probably won't be back to this location until I forget again. Oh well.  Food is OK"}
{"text":"Didn't like the service. They told us the wait for 8 adults and 3 kids would be 20 to 30 minutes, We waited patiently because we understand that it was a big party but an hour later they still told us it would be around 10 more minutes. I hate inconsiderate people. If you knew that it's going to be a longer wait then just say it, don't waste my time. Never coming back here and I hope they train them to talk to customers in a polite way. I deal with people everyday and that's definitely not the way to treat customers."}
{"text":"Its Appelbee's, so its nothing to be overly excited about, but the food was okay and the service was fine.  I ordered a cowboy burger and my friend ordered chicken fingers.  I think they key to having a good experience here is to keep it simple and order things that aren't likely to get messed up.  Overall, its fine as a chain and much better than the fast food in the proximity, but its not fine dining, so don't expect that."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Whole family had fun and grwat time.  Warm welcomed and greated when came inside.  Seated right away... server Trista was awesome.  She was so helpful and thogh we had some customization on our order...she nailed it.... food came out warm and nicely done.  Recommended for anyone looking to spend some nice tome with good food...  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Applebee's is a nice place to go with the kiddos. They have appetizer specials during the late hours (10p-12a I think?) and from 4p-6p. The  drink special was a Long Island for $6 on Friday night. The menu always has plenty to chose from. I personally wish they had more healthy seafood options.    The choice of tummy satisfaction attempts for this meal were the French onion soup and the cedar salmon. The soup was definitely just \"plopped\" together, as seen in the picture, but the taste was fine and typical of the soup. The salmon was served on top of a potato, spinach and zucchini mix with a creamy sauce on top. It was very tasteful and the salmon size was generous and cooked very well. I will order this again.   The restaurant is friendly to children. They have nice appetizer and drink specials. The service has been pretty steady for us every time we come with friendly servers and decent attention. We also never have to wait to be seated, even when it's busy, and our food always comes out timely. We are usually in and out of here for dinner within 1 hour to 1 1/2, depending on hour fast we eat!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for a work dinner.  The service was adequate, although the server was not very helpful in accommodating a request for a vegetarian meal.  Portions are too small in size and mediocre in taste for the price.  Would only visit again as an extreme last resort."}
{"text":"The food is good for the cheap prices they have but the staff is not very polite. I have been twice in your location and both times the server was not friendly at all...I loved the dessert . And another thing..there are no prices for the cocktails which i don't find it normal."}
{"text":"I ordered a triple bacon burger and only received two pieces of bacon. The burger was good and the fries was good but I was just missing the bacon. I also ordered chicken wonton tacos which are delicious. I highly recommend. And they have a very good strawberry lemonade that I tried too, they just need to add more bacon to the triple bacon burger."}
{"text":"Over priced and low quality food. This was my first and definitely last time dinning with Applebees.    Only up side...a window seat with a/c."}
{"text":"It's an Applebee's so you already know what to expect. I honestly highly dislike this chain (especially with how outrageous their calorie counts are) and would normally give them 2 stars at best but we came here today for the free Veteran's day meal and I will honestly say I was blown away at how good their sirloin steak was for being an $11 steak that comes with two sides, at a chain restaurant. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like going to chain restaurants  in general but the excellent service here definitely changed my mindset Margaret or Margot was our server and she rocked it to the fullest extent She would most assuredly be the reason I came back"}
{"text":"This Applebee's has always been one of my least favorite restaurants in the Surprise area.  To me its always a lackluster experience.  Maybe its the fact that this place is typically packed full of senior citizens which kind of makes it feel like I am sitting at an old folks home rather than a restaurant.  I typically like Applebee's, but this one not so much.  My family and I went here the other night after several hours of cruising around town looking at Christmas lights.  Needless to say we were hungry and Applebee's was one of the few restaurants in the Surprise area that remains open after 9 PM.  We walked into the place and was greeted by a young hostess who looked as though she was sedated.  We were given a monotone greeting and escorted to our table.  I noticed that the bill from the previous customers was still on the table.  I made a joke about using the money inside it to pay for our meal, but she was too sedated to get the joke or my cue to remove it.  I don't think she even understands that you should never sit a customer at a table where the previous customer's bill is still on the table.  She just walked away, leaving it there for us deal with.  Its not the end of the world, but it just another example of how the younger generations are clueless about service etiquette.  A short while later, our server approached us and quickly noticed that the previous customer's bill was still on our table.  She quickly snatched it up and I thought to myself there is a server who understands restaurant etiquette, but then she tossed the billfold onto the table behind her and left it there for the remainder of our meal.  As a customer, I wouldn't like my bill being left behind for anyone to see.  From a manager's point of view, this is not good practice, and will likely result in stolen money, lost receipts, and trouble reconciling at the end of the night. Anyway, I was in a Christmas mood and ordered a Baileys on ice and what I got was less than a swallow full of Baileys poured over ice.  Basically what I got was ice cubes coated in Baileys.  The only way I could get any Baileys was to suck on the ice cubes.  My wife commented that it looked like I was given an empty glass of Baileys that someone else had already drank.  I commented to our server about this and she just said sorry.  Hey, at least I got a sorry.  We also ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and couldn't stop laughing when it arrived at our table.  What we got was 13 cold stale tortilla chips with a thimble full of salsa.  What a joke!  I was hoping for something similar to what you get at Chili's...a basket full of fresh, hot, steamy, tortilla chips with enough salsa to finish the entire basket.  Booo Applebee's.  A short while later our food was delivered by other servers and before we noticed that we had no silverware they were gone.  We had to wait five minutes before we could wave down our server for silverware.  Then we had to go through this process all over again with the ketchup.  I don't understand in this day and age where ketchup is such a main staple in the American diet that restaurants don't stock tables with ketchup.  On the other hand, the thought countless strangers handling a ketchup bottle always gives me the heebie-jeebies.  Ketchup is a lose-lose situation for me.  The remainder of our experience there was blah.  Our server was MIA most of the time, especially when it came time to paying our bill.  This added another 10 minutes to our checkout process waiting for our server to reappear.  All in all, another disappointing experience at this Applebee's."}
{"text":"Robert D was waiter tonight and he was so awesome! He constantly checked on us and had great conversations, very helpful when it came to suggestions on the menu and overall awesome. Our family was very satisfied by his service and the food was great. I ordered a patron margarita with medium steak, perfection. Everything was great tonight, definitely recommend this location and Robert of course."}
{"text":"A clear disappointment.  The only reason that I ate here was the free Veterans Day meal.  It was more like an appetizer.  Not only that, but for restaurant claiming to support veterans and the military, it makes them look bad when they post a \"no firearms\" sign on their front door."}
{"text":"Service took so long. The waitress didn't bring any napkins or forks with our food. Waited 10 mins for a refill. Never coming back again !"}
{"text":"2 for $20 is still a great deal. A lot of TVs made it nice to watch the Badgers in the Big 10 championship game. Aubrey P. was a great server. Overall a great meal out!!"}
{"text":"I see Applebee's as the good ol' restaurant that I decide to go to if nothing else is open, nothing else is nearby, nothing else seems good, and I just really don't want to go home and cook/eat leftovers. And, just like every other Applebee's I have been to, nothing really stands out. I did, however, enjoy the dishes I ordered.  Service was average. The only negative remark about my second server was that he did not seem happy working there and also forgot to refill my water after I asked. Other than that he was just an average server.  In regards to food, the 2 for $20 deal (can be found on the last page of the menu) gives you the best bang for your buck. It comes with an appetizer and two entrees.  We ordered the potato twisters for starters. This was a pleasant surprise for me. It seems that this dish consists of thinly sliced potatoes that are fried with a spicy cheese dip. The potatoes vary -- some slices are half fried and half soft, whereas some are fully fried. I enjoy this because it gives this dish a unique flare. The spicy cheese dip was really good as well and complemented the potatoes perfectly. I recommend this dish to anyone who is also a fellow potato fan. A+++++  Between my boyfriend and I, the two entrees we ordered included the Applebee's Riblets in Honey BBQ and the Three-Cheese Chicken Penne. These two dishes were good, but not \"I-am-going-to-tell-all-my-friends-about-this\" good. Just good.  I am honestly not sure what people expect from a chain restaurant like Applebee's, but I recommend you trying the three dishes I have tried if you are looking a fulfilling meal. I also recommend checking out the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 page if you are sharing amongst people.   This is Applebee's people... so honestly, what do you expect from the food? Gourmet? lol"}
{"text":"1/25/2013 - Don't order water. It's absolutely disgusting. Tastes unfiltered n very chlorinated. No ketchup in bottle at my table. My fries was cold, hamburger was average. I guess this was due to them beating their 14 min promo or its free. Never again!"}
{"text":"They do have a bar in the center of the place and TV's everywhere but..  This is a great place to bring the kids for a meal.  Service is good, food is great everytime. This location has just recently remodeled and now it looks more like a Sports bar.  I had the Quesadilla Burger,Wifey had the Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich , Son had the Chicken Fingers with Brocolli and we all shared the Trio Appetizer platter with  mini burgers,chicken parmesan strips and a steak chimichanga.  EVERYTHING was Excellent!!  The only ding on this place was the Iced Tea was a little watered down for my taste.  They do have a bar in the center of the place and TV's everywhere but..

Yeah it's a chain store but it's CHEAp $40 for 3 people w/appetizer But its consistently good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Applebee's has long been a neighborhood bar & grill we enjoy frequenting because of the amazing deals they have like the 2 for $20-share an appetizer & dessert plus get 2 entrees. NOW that's a price fixe 2fer.  Unfortunately this time around they didn't have any specials so we all ordered off the menu and it costs over $60 w/tip!! What a difference a special makes:)  We decided to go with an appetizer some chicken fingers and a NY steak dinner. The fingers were good, better than most bars in #Vegas-The steak was right on, a great piece of meat cooked perfectly and seasoned well with a great mushroom & garlic add-on.  The service as always was outstanding...they are always on top of it no matter when you go or how busy it gets.  I know this is a \"chain\" place but I keep it on my radar for cheap + consistent!!! Always happy when I leave.ALWAYS good in the neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"Applebee's What to say? It's OK-The 2 for $20 deal is Great!!!  An appetizer & 2 entrees for $20!!  We got 2 of them and a dinner salad.  Appetizers: Boneless Buffalo Wings-HOT Spinach Artichoke Dip  Entrees  Ribs w/Fries x2 Quesadilla Burger A-1 Burger  NO Dessert! ICED TEA all around.  The service was sketchy-started off with watered down tea.  The food was ok-at least the appetizers were-good bar food.  The burgers were greasy,bland and had gristle in them.  The ribs were bony,NOT smoked but the sauces were good!!  Not bad for CHEAP eats but theres much better places as Suzie Q pointed out!"}
{"text":"This location has very slow service. They do not have enough staff to handle the volume of customers. The place overall is not the cleanest Applebee's. The food was good and the beer was cold. What else can I really say? It's Applebees."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Went there for my free Veterans Day dinner. They allowed me to take it to go, since they were so packed. The lady that took my to go order was awesome, sweet, fast and did it with a smile. Way to treat your vets on Veterans Day!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"WTF happened to Applebee's? Used to be one of my favorite restaurants. They didn't just change the menu, they changed the taste. Mediocre at best. I am holding out hope that the other one at Country Hills is still good."}
{"text":"Service was horrible tonight.  Very nice people just very slow.  Ordered appetizer and meal.  Meal came but no appetizer.  Manger came said he would put appetizer order in on him.  Appetizer came out without all the sauces mentioned and well after I was done with meal.  Received bill and should have received 10& off for veteran's appreciation....received no discount,and were billed for both meals plus the appetizer.  This place needs some serious work.  Nice people but severely lacking in service. Horrible since the options in Laveen are limited."}
{"text":"First of all happy new year to everyone! I have been to this Apple bees few times last year and my experience wasn't too bad. The servers were all nice and friendly. But tonight was one of my worst experiences in an American restaurant.  The server was rude and was even yelling and almost confrontational. My friend and I were supposed  to share a burger and she mistakenly thought we are ordering two burgers. Once she found out her mistake or I should say confusion she started raising her voice and got upset and my friend even told her to please calm down as if she was the customer. We ended up talking to another server after the encounter but we could not wait to talk to the manager because it was the worst experience in a neighborhood chain restaurant. The food is just ok at its best but we still come here because of decent service. However tonight was a big disappointment and we will never come back to this place again. Come on we live in Vegas and there are tons of choices out there!"}
{"text":"My family & I just had a horrible experience at Applebee's on Rainbow & 95! We waited 1/2 hr b4 our waitress came with our salads saying \"these got lost in the shuffle\". At this time, she informed us that our entrees would be right out. She totally 4got to put in our app order! She didn't check on us once, to see if everything was ok, so we could have asked about our appetizers. This wasn't the worst part, because, hey, we all make mistakes. It was our treatment afterwards, by the manager, that was appalling. He came over to our table table with an attitude as if we were the troublemakers! He didn't apologize at all. We decided to leave & he proceeded to make us wait another ten minutes to pay for our sodas! We'll be calling corporate!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I take pride in the fact that I don't usually burden other people with my children. They are typically well mannered children, the older one (who knows how to talk) always says \"please\" and \"thank you\" and my younger son (1 years old) on average hardly makes any noise because he's too busy stuffing his face.   However, any child can have a bad day.  My younger son was sleeping when my mother in law decided to take us to Applebees after a day of shopping. When he woke up in Applebee's he was clearly taken by surprise. He wailed loudly, and the waitress came over. She had already gotten us settled with drinks and we had placed our food order. No backing out now. \"Do you want some warm water for a bottle?\" she inquired politely. We thanked her and she went to grab some water.   Meanwhile, my older son who was drawing quietly on his kids menu got a little overzealous and knocked his soda everywhere. When the waitress returned she didn't look the least bit annoyed and went to fetch a towel, smiling and talking to the kids all the while. At this point I was uber embarassed and ready to high tail it out of there, but she made me feel much more at ease. She chatted with us about her three boys and told us stories about back when they were in diapers. The food came out quickly, I ordered the Won Ton Tacos (usually an appetizer) as an entree and it was great.   Applebee's is family friendly. From food to atmosphere they're a great option for when you can't get away from the kiddos. Although you can get much higher quality food somewhere else, I don't think I would overlook them any time I want to take my kids with me. They have Weight Watchers endorsed food too - and it's tasty!"}
{"text":"My Daughter  turned 17 today and my Husband decided to take her a friend and our other daughter  there for dinner.  We have had  good dinner there in the past but what a disappointment  tonight of all nights  they ordered the trio  apt and it was so small they  hesitate  to eat it because wasn't  enough to share then My husband's  chicken dish came out and was rubbery total ineatible  and last but most importantly  they came to the table to celebrate  her birthday  and she was in restroom  OK just come back they didn't come back  so done with you never again everyone  has bad nights but no attempt  to fix it"}
{"text":"Eating good in the neighborhood ! Service was great at this location. We had a gift card so we went . I was impressed . Food was good and everyone was real nice . Did the 2 for 26$ . Got ribs and my date got a steak . Can't beat the price . We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I love stopping by there once a week for our date night. We go during happy hour, you can't beat half price drinks and appetizers. Drink recommendations; the Perfect Margarita or the Long Island Ice Tea, both of which are on the happy hour special. Appetizer recommendation; wanton tacos or nachos, sadly the nachos are not on the special."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 2 times during lunch because it is close to my work. I didn't think the service was that great either time. The food is good though. I will probably be back to this location unfortunately because there is not much around this area to eat when you only get an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has bad reviews. I would not come here ever much less ever bring my kids here!!! My family member was assaulted last night and no one who worked there did anything.  The women who dragged her around by her hair and made her fall out her chair at the bar had been there for FOUR HOURS DRINKING. the bar tender was laughing and did nothing!! This makes me believe this lady is a regular.  Management did nothing last night!! I called this morning and the manager on duty said \"I wasn't working so this has nothing to do with me\". Excuse me but if you have a manager title it has something to do with you whether you were working or not!! I am contacting ALE and have already contacted applebees customer care. I worked in a bar for years and having heard about this the women shouldn't have been served anymore. Many other patrons said she was overly intoxicated and becoming mouthy. I would not spend a penny here!!!"}
{"text":"I indulge in an Applebee's signature dish from time to time. Here and there. Now and again. I love their autumnal classics like their french fries and their ranch dressing.  They pour a mean glass of skim milk and if you ask they'll even make it cold for you. Just like mom used to make! Anyways, long story short, love applebees. Love car side to go. Love appz. Love zerts. Love the hometown feel.  Love how even when they're closed on a Friday night they'll still let the football team in after a big game.  Love it."}
{"text":"i came in for a lunch date with my family and was treated like a lower class customer by our server (Pattie). Very blunt and unfriendly she kept putting us aside and giving us half ass service. At the end we tried tipping her and her response was rude saying \"just leave it there\" and dropped it on the table, she was unpleased with the tip. i was baffled by the way she treated us the whole time. i will not be returning."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced.  Came in for late night and requested a booth.  Everyone must request them because there wanst one available but yet the tables were empty.  They were filled with dishes to be bussed.  The staff didn't seem to have much ambition to clean em.    Ordered drinks and we were shocked when we were charged $10 for a tiny margarita.  What a rip. Ordered half off apps menu .You couldn't order more than one per person. I felt like there were a lot of restrictions for the late night menu.   Food was good, service was ok. Got the bill and our waiter didn't even stay thank you or have good night.  Kind of an awkward way to end the experience. Total bill for a couple appetizers and two drinks was $65  I did notice that there were employees sitting around at bar and in corner for the whole time we dined.  Considering how over staffed they were you think the tables might be cleaned off.  Also it's a bit unpleasant hearing  the waitstaff complain about their tips."}
{"text":"I had the bourbon chicken and shrimp dinner. I got small portions, big price tag, mediocre food. I've had better frozen dinners."}
{"text":"My server Ashely could not be any less attentive, no refills the entire night and it took her almost an entire 45 minutes to take our order. And when we made a point that we're annoyed that we weren't being attended well, she decides to be snappy, the manager also was no help. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The service at the bar was terrible. I sat down and the bartender looked at me and moved to the end of the bar to talk with friends.  He was slow unattentive and did not care because \"they are closing 160 applebees. This one sucks so i know it will close\". Poor ignorant attitude. He ignored a server's order so long the people lefrtge resturant swearing..    never again for me.  I hope it closes soon and a good resturant goes  in uts place."}
{"text":"Got take out food was great, takeout was as fast as McDonald's just make sure you call in ahead. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Specials are great. After reading a lot of reviews, I was surprised. Food isn't bad, drinks are good. It's Applebee's!! Give it a rest. Go to capital grill if your expectations aren't met here!"}
{"text":"Applebees is a good place to go the service is great and the drinks are good and great places especially happy hour they have these amazing Wong tan tacos but there wings and cheese sticks are horrible the marinara and cheese sticks are always cold and the wings suck they deffinately need to know how to make wings I make better ones at home that people would pay money for"}
{"text":"Customer service is key to any restaurant, especially a sit-down restaurant. This location needs some training in that department. I stood waiting for a pickup order for 12mins after it was supposed to be ready. Everyone walked passed me like I wasn't even standing there. Then a women finally comes around the corner and to serve me and that she did: she took my money and didn't offer a receipt. Then she reached around the corner where my food had been sitting and gave me the semi-cold food. Can I have a receipt please? First and last visit."}
{"text":"I love Applebee's and have been going here for as long as I can remember. Recently tonight my sister and niece and I came to enjoy dinner. First thing it took a while for our waiter Hugo to come to the table, and when he did come we placed our drink orders. I ordered a lemonade, sis ordered a water, my 2 year old niece order an apple juice. So we're waiting and finally our drinks come, but that's it only my sister and I drinks came first. Shouldn't children be served first? It took darn near 20 minutes for them to bring her a simple carton of apple juice, remind you she's 2, and was thirsty and was getting antsy. He comes back we place our orders and wait for our food. The food was delicious everything was done well to me and my sisters liking. So as we're eating and conversing not ONCE did our waiter come to check on us and ask us how everything was going, but he sure did check on the other table being as often as he could. We weren't rude to him or anything, so I don't understand what the problem was, we didn't leave him a tip, and we don't know if we'll be back."}
{"text":"It's not like I ever think to myself, Applebees sounds good. But I live in the area and they are open late, so I've been to this location for dinner 3-4 times in the past year.   I can't say many good things about the food. The BLT is horrible. The bacon cheeseburger is merely okay. Could have been better except the meat was really well done.  Last time I went, I ordered a chicken+mushroom+zucchini with red potatoes entree, and they brought out shrimp over white rice. Although they were apologetic and did get the correct order out about 10 minutes later.  I've only ordered alcohol here once. It was during happy hour and I got a huge margarita. I easily finished it but didn't even get a tiny buzz. They must really water down the drinks.   This seems like more of a place to go and hang out and have a few drinks and maybe get an appetizer to share. It's not a destination restaurant for me. I've had better food at Denny's."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, gave a time when I  would be there.  They had 45 minutes to have it ready. Got there at the time I said and it still Looks took over 10 minutes  to get the order., that is why I  called ahead"}
{"text":"Ugh idk what happened to this place but wow did it go bad! The menu overwhelms you with pick 2 /pick 3 options & they no longer have riblets! Then there's a pointless/ worthless device on the table to \"order your own food\" even though it's so dead in there the servers are just waiting there for you to order lol expensive bill & terrible quality service & food. Not coming back here again"}
{"text":"Wah wah wah... Rare CLASSIC burger came SMASHED and burned to a crisp. Added mushrooms got 5 pieces of mushroom(not whole slices), I mean 5 little pieces... BBQ spiced fries served as regular fries with a spice to pour over? Showed the waiter my burger NO ACTON! BOO HOO."}
{"text":"Had a problem with this store a couple weeks ago. Had a group of ten people, we waited 10 minutes to wait to seated! No one bothered to greet us or even to acknowledge us! We wrote corporate. Their new District manager call and acknowledge they had a problem. He stated that it would take 9 months to a year to fix the problems! He was a stand up guy. He sent me a letter that gave us 4 dinners and an apology! We used it yesterday for 2 dinners! We talked to the new manager! She and the Owner stated that they would honor the letter, only    to the letter of what was stated! We ordered 2 dinners, 2 soft drinks and a dessert! Our \"Free\" Dinner ended costing us $16.00 after tipping our server! We ordered their baby back ribs. They were spare ribs, NOT BABY BACKS! They charge $18.00 each! Their portions for the food were very skimpy for the price! NOT A GOOD VALUE! They comped the meals, but charged for the drinks and the desert. Not a problem, but their attitude was less then nice and sincere! We think the Owner and the manager were Very Mean Spirited and resented the fact that they have a terrible restaurant and were called on it! Needless to say, This Owner and this manager has NOT LEARNED  what good service is!! They deserve to go bankrupt and lose their business! We suggest you not patronize this very badly run restaurant until they get another Owner or becomes Corporate! Unless you like rude, terrible service and an an insincere attitude from management and  ownership that resents doing the right thing  with an aggressive, patronizing, manner! They act like they DO NOT WANT OUR BUSINESS OR OUR MONEY! NO PROBLEM!! They won't get either!!  Mean Spirited Ownership - with an Bad attitude and a chip on their shoulder!! Avoid Applebees @ East Towne Mall, Madison, Wi!! Save your money and your nerves!"}
{"text":"Oh, American fast food chains.  How large your portions.  How nostalgic you are.  We were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.  Since we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.    When we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like \"Can you sit at the bar?\"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.  Chuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.  I had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!  My side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!  Then came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with \"Sweet and Spicy Sauce\" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their \"special burgers\" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him \"pink or no pink\" which we thought was funny.  He said \"pink,\" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.  That all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food."}
{"text":"When I hear the phrase \"all you can eat\" coupled with \"for a limited time\" it's like crack...can't resist trying it out!  On this occasion it was Cross cut Ribs.  I started off with the spinach and artichoke dip, which is one of the better examples I've had in the chain restaurant world.  Not too thin/thick, good mix of non-cream cheese and spinach, comes with run of the mill tortilla chips.    I have to say I am unable to recommend the cross cut ribs.  \"Cross cut\" is another word for \"bone chips\" which made it very difficult to find bites of meat without the risk of choking or chipping a tooth.  There are three sauces to try....I had smoky bbq and honey bbq.  Neither was finger lickin good.  There was also an unpleasant outer skin on the ribs.  On the plus side, the seasoned fries were very good!  The coleslaw had an odd, recently washed container taste to it.    Our server, I believe named Crystal?, was great, she kept my iced tea glass full and was helpful with anything we needed.  Two managers were also kind enough to stop by and ask how things were going.  Being able to pay at the table using their mounted displays was also nice...even though my card didn't work the first time...Crystal helped make it right!    All in all...skip the ribs, double down on the fries!"}
{"text":"On this particular day my family and I hardly get to spend time let alone eat a good nice dinner every once in awhile together. We decided to go to Applebees and this was a disappointment to my family and I. We had the worst experience here.  After being seated for about 13 minutes we were not asked If we wanted drinks. Immidiately we asked for drinks it's only hot in Phoenix even at nine a clock at night it's still 100 degrees out.  Basically all in all I am saying when we were thirsty we had nothing to drink, when we were hungry we had nothing to eat, when we were ready to eat we had nothing to eat our food with.   Please try to imagine when your appetizers come riding along with your dinner it's unpleasant and unexpected especially when you have a small table for a party of 4."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Very attentive severs and bar tenders! Good food decent pricing   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Applebee's twice this week and the experiences were somewhat the same but different enough to comment on.  The first visit the we had a minimum of 5 people at our table to serve us in one way or another.  The service was good but it got confusing. I would have preferred one server who oversaw my meal.  Additionally, of all those people, no one checked to see how we liked our meal.  Fortunately, I loved my meal but I wished I had more napkins b/c I was eating ribs.  When we left I noticed that their chalkboard had something removed but not by erasing but by writing over the lettering. I don't understand why not erase the info but oddly it was in the same state when I visited later in the week.  But really, it's no big deal.  The second visit was even better than the first.  Our waiter, Danny, was amazing.  He was friendly, helpful, prompt, upbeat, and everything else you want in a good server.  We at the same meal b/c we enjoyed it so much the first time."}
{"text":"Maggie was our server and she didn't do a great job.  She gave me a weird look while I was ordering (I don't remember why but it was odd). She didn't check -in with us after the food arrived.  We were sitting near the bar and we could hear and see her reviewing the drink schedule with another employee. We waited along time after finishing before she finally brought us our bill.  Before I bill came, I over heard another server tell Maggie that table 21 was waiting for their bill. I hoped that we were this table but it turns out it was the adjacent table who had been waiting longer than us for their bill.  The mac and cheese as bland/without enough cheese.  On the good side: beverage refills were prompt (not provided by Maggie though).  Overall, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was nice. Don't order the two for twenty or the servers get pissed off! My diner companion had to wait for his hot sauce for 10 minutes or so while I was eating and he felt rushed, especially since we were presented with the electronic check before he was halfway through. Definitely a thumbs down experience!"}
{"text":"No sooner did I order my fav dish, salmon with steamed veggies, server says that it is going off the menu. Bad timing on his part. Couldn't he wait till I was done. Plus he had an annoying overloud voice. So Applebees is replacing salmon with tilapia. Yuck, who decided this. It is like replacing a steak with a burger. Salmon plate was served, an unattractive presentation, but tasted great. Salmon cooked just right. Asked for bread or garlic toast, but Applebees serves no bread. What? Menu is being replaced says the server, going upscale. Will soon have butcher in the back cutting meat. Big whoop, I think.  An unappealing picture comes to mind of the butcher in his bloody apron, hacking up meat along side meals being plated. This can not be a good thing. All of this adds up so no reason for me to go back to Applebees."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this location tonight. I was having a terrible time with anxiety when I came in for dinner this evening. Our server, Erica, made me feel instantly at ease. She offered happy hour drinks and appetizers while we waited for the rest of our group. My watermelon margarita was perfect. When our family arrived, we quickly got appetizers and drinks. Erica was great with our picky eating requests and with our seven year old boy. All of our food was great. We had a rare steak and and a well done steak on our order and both were perfect. That is impressive. Erica checked in a bunch of times to make sure we were ok. It was a great experience all around. We chose Applebees because we had gift cards, but now I certainly would chose it again."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly but did not multi-task well, took 15 minutes to get check when we were clearly done with our food. 2/4 of our orders were incorrect. Steak was well done not medium. My half rack of ribs were dry and burned with very low sauce amount. Was on afc/nfc championship game night while not being very busy at all. Chef, runner and waitress all failed, the beer was good though."}
{"text":"3 of us went out to dinner there because we had a gift card and all 3 of our dishes were disappointing. 2 of us got the 2 for 20 deal, boneless wings (which weren't bad but honestly how do you mess up boneless wings), the new Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp (the other guy got the same meal) and shrimp and i got the Fiesta Lime Chicken. Parts of the chicken were burnt and dry; and the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp lack flavor and complementary sides. The service in the bar where we sat wasn't too bad though... the food just sucked."}
{"text":"Will never come to this Applebee's again I witness a young black/Asian male get kicked out because he called out a white man at the bar. They took his food from him that be paid for as well. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The Avon Applebee's team is awesome! They went out of their way to donate a fabulous meal to our lacrosse team for our season ending banquet this week. The food was so great! Scott, the manager, was so kind and helpful to work with, and Ally took time to carefully prepare everything. It was perfect!  :)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick family dinner and this ended up where we landed. From my last experience I wasn't too happy about that, but was soon pleasantly surprised. It was very busy , but we were seated within minutes and ordered a few drinks and appetizers. Our waitress was great and very attentive . Out food arrived shortly after our appetizer, but with enough time that we were finished with it. It was the first time that nothing was wrong with our order, and the food everyone ordered was PERFECT. I ordered the three cheese pasta with chicken and it was seasoned great, and the cheese melted perfectly and not dry like it had been under the heat lamp forever . All the kids ate their entire plates and couldn't stop talking about how great everything was. We made sure to give a shoutout to the cook, told the manager on duty and also gave a survey for the waitress. If this food and service keeps up we will be back so much more. So I am changing my previous three starts to five from this great experience."}
{"text":"Soooo, my boys enjoyed their pasta kid's meals.  I had trouble deciding what I wanted and the bruchetta salad was what the waiter suggested.  It was awesome!  I mean aside from the fried cheese it came w/.  I never understood why ppl what to always fatten up something healthy.  Anyways, my husband's experience was not so nice.  He placed his order and it came back wrong...TWICE!  He was already irritated w/ the waiter calling my hun and sweetie.  But when the waiter actually left the check and obviously checked me out...looking me up and down, it was all over.  I had to usher the Hubs out and I know he didn't leave a tip!  Well, not much of one...ugh.  Hence the three stars.  However the vibe was cool, people spoke and greeted you nicely..."}
{"text":"So apparently i got a ice cream and brownie for my night before birthday at applebees and i didnt even get a happy birthday song shout out... wtf... anyways i will not be coming back to the applebees on power and ray... paul was a good waiter bit apparently was intimidated by me for whatever reason and did not do the song. Oh well... i guess i will continue to chilis... thanks applebees..."}
{"text":"Came here once for lunch and never went back nor will I ever go back unless they change their Management. Very Slow service and the food was not hot. Service was extremely poor and we were there after 2 p.m. so there was no crowds.  Stay Away and save yourself the aggravation."}
{"text":"This is your typical Applebee's and is a good choice while staying in the area. I visit area a few times a year and have eaten at this Applebee's several times and have always found the food to be good and well prepared.  The staff is friendly and takes care of your needs without being intrusive.  Never had a bad experience here and will continue to visit when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Good place for a beer and cocktail. Open late too so good when most places are closing. Try the triple pork threar sandwich. Yum."}
{"text":"Brooke is the absolute *best*. We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and Brooke went above and beyond to help us with things we needed, was incredibly patient with us, and made our entire experience so much better. A huge thanks goes out to her."}
{"text":"Applebee's, or at least this location is worth passing on. They're a wanna be Chili's. It's always empty, not a good sign for a restaurant. The food is OK, but you leave feeling like you didn't get your moneys worth. Adult beverages don't seem to have any alcohol in them. I guess on a positive note, they're clean."}
{"text":"Here for happy hour on a hump day. Service was great! I had the dip, chunks of tender artichoke, chips light and salty. My BF liked the Asian wings. Long islands were tasty and not too strong."}
{"text":"This restaurant is okay. I come here often with family, the atmosphere is good for conversation. The staff are friendly and attentive. The food is hit or miss. I got the spicy sweet Asian chile boneless wings, which I really liked. The boyfriend got the all-in American standard burger and it was not good. The patty was pretty dry and it wasn't very flavorful. I did enjoy my Bahama Mama which was super cheap."}
{"text":"Buh-rutal!,  went there for a quick dinner last night with my daughter. After taking our order our waitress disappeared. Overheard gentleman next to us send back his food. Our order came and I received a plate of \"ribs\" that looked like a pile of dog food..turned out to be the wrong type of ribs AND no one ever checked on us so...ate some fries and began the long wait for our check and to have my horrific order removed from bill. A different waitress listens to our complaints and handles it quickly and nicely. Original waitress now reappears and puts bill on table without any knowledge of other conversation we just had with other waitress. And no apology or even acting like her disappearance was anything other than normal!  LOL! In this time another large party was sat down next to us and after being ignored for over 20 minutes they all got up and left....I'm sure by now you get it! Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I called ahead to find out what the wait time was. I was told there was no wait time (Monday @ 6:30)  When we arrived we were immediately sat. Our waiter arrived promptly to take our drink orders and by the time he came back with our drinks we were ready to order.   I ordered the shrimp and steak, my girls ordered the 2 for $20 deal. Chicken basket and rib basket. The appetizers were boneless wings for the girls and a side salad for me.  We got our appetizers within 15 minutes and our meal came out 10 minutes latter.   My steak was tender and cooked to my liking. The shrimp with parmesan sauce had a lot of flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were the perfect side as well as the steamed broccoli.   The girls both liked their dinner. The only complaint was the Shirley temple tasted water downed.   Service was quick from the time we were seated to the time we got our food  and to the end when we got our bill and were walking out.    I have no complaints. Applebee's is an affordable place to eat good food."}
{"text":"I will not be in a hurry at all to come here again. I used to really like their Siracha Shrimp, but today I went and was told they changed their menu about two weeks ago and that is now gone. So I looked over their smaller menu and said \"okay, I guess I'll just have chips and salsa as an appetizer\". The waitress said \"Oh, well, you already get chips and salsa free with the Margarita you ordered\".  Okay, well, thank God I said I wanted chips and salsa because prior to that, there was NO mention of me getting free chips and salsa with my Margarita!  So then I ordered a grilled chicken and shrimp with mushrooms and onions. It was okay, but nothing I couldn't make at home. Next time, I'll just c chicken, shrimp and mushrooms in a bunch of butter and pay a lot less for it."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had two gift cards and went for the 2 for $25 specials. She ordered the chicken and shrimp and I ordered the sirloin. She did not like her meal saying there was so much sauce and spice on it that she could not even taste the chicken. Worst, my sirloin was actually pork steak. It looked, smelled and tasted and had the texture and grain of pork. Two employees said that Applebees would never do that ... oh yes they did and have done ... take a look and you will see some other reviewers that have had the same experience at other Applebees even in other states ... not good if you must not eat pork! Waitress kept forgetting to follow-up on questions. And that free appetizer if the they forget to ask you to buy a gift card ... our waitress got out of that by saying \"oh yeah that's part of my job\". But we both know that's not true. We even had to ask her about the remote card swiper on the table and she definitely did not talk about the cards then either. We won't be back."}
{"text":"After spending all of my 22 years of life watching the commercials on tv, I finally got around to going here. It wasn't half bad.  My server was attentive, but I was never offered a refill. I'm not sure if they do that, but after traveling around Europe (and free refills not being a thing over there) I missed the free refills that America offers.  I decided to try steak because there were so many choices of entrees with steak. I would go back just to try another steak entree.  I got the Grilled Vidalia Onion Sirloin because it was one of the summer specials and I love grilled onions. The dish was the steak served with a onion on top and had a sweet and spicy Hawaiian BBQ sauce and served with steamed garlicky spinach and crispy smashed potatoes.  The garlicky spinach was my favorite part. I never had spinach that flavorful. The steak was good too. The sauce definitely tasted good with the steak. I just wish it was bigger.   Overall, I liked the food. I thought that the portions were small. I was still hungry after so my friend and I went to get food some other place. The food was cooked really well, but just the portion size disappointed me. It's a toss-up if I would go back or not."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early dinner. We've been to this location a few times now and it seems like each time has been worse than the time before. I ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp. I don't recommend it. NOTHING about it suggested any kind of bourbon and the shrimp was cooked to the point of being colorless. That's after I waited 20 minutes or more AFTER 2 other dinner plates we brought to the table. Actually my appetizers took almost 10 minutes longer than my wife's. I don't recommend this spot for anyone. Find another and hope for better."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a lunch and food was good, what made our experience were all the friendly staff! Taylor was so nice and when we told her it was our first time in Ohio she gave us so many wonderful suggestions!! Our waitress Nikki was really courteous as well. One of our best experiences at an Applebee's!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of applebee's never have been and never will be, but I was out numbered yesterday when my family decided that they wanted to eat there.  So I went, and I explained that it would be nasty but they said let's give it a try so we did.  When we got inside I noticed that the music was soo loud that it's they were having a concert for the neighborhood, it was soo cold in there that it was warmer outside and it's the fall people.  Any who, our server was in the back laying down when we were greeted, he finally came to our table very nice guy and he was the high light of the whole visit even though it didn't start off well.  We ordered our food, the choices were not good not enough of a selection.  Any way, we all ordered our food and waited, for some reason we didn't notice that we didn't have eating utensils until I food came.  Our server didn't even realize it, so my question is why wasn't the tables set at the time of opening?  Ok I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and I must say that the bacon was the best part of the burger.  Applebee's has the most flavorless food I've ever had in my whole life, and yall know I like to eat...lol.  Any who, it was horrible I had to make my self get through most of the burger because I was hunger, normally I would complain and not pay for it and move on.  But I just was ready to go at this point, when I got my food my fries were so cold it's like they had just taken them from the refridgerator, so he took them back and I got more not too much better so I just let it be.  The rest of my family didn't enjoy their food either, so it was like ok I'm going to eat this because we are hungry and we waited for it.  I will never ever ever in my whole life even if it's the last place on earth to eat, even if their are no more grocery stores, and I can't grow my own food ever ever eat at Applebee's again.  It was just nasty, I said to my family before we started to eat our food I can't believe that their even still a business.  And after that was over, I don't see how they are in business really.  I didn't think factory food could taste that bad.  Oh yeah and the bartender had to seat us, I must say this was the first time I have ever seen that.  Any who never again."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill fast. Food is gross, staff is unattentative, music is VERY LOUD and unprofessional for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come in for dinner being that the last time i was in this location i had excellent service (it was also their first week open and a manager on every corner) well it was a 30 min wait which i dont mind. Im also in the restaurant business so i understand it gets busy it gets busy... I felt so disrespected when the hostess Aden called my child \"THAT\" she never apologize and she did it infront of other guests they all couldn't believe it.   Im writting this review hoping that management can enforce better customer service & so that the employess can have better choice of words.. Its not that hard. I will not be going back... Sincerly, A VERY dissapointed Applebees costumer."}
{"text":"My 81 year old grandmother and I had to leave because one of the servers was so loud during her extremely sexual conversation with another table. It takes a lot to make me blush, but she did it. It was disgusting while trying to eat. It was humiliating in front of my grandmother. Never going back."}
{"text":"I came here twice this autumn, once with a friend and once with my siblings. I got a chicken breast with potatoes and shrimp entree and I got a couple of appetizers with my siblings during happy hour- wonton tacos and beef quesadillas. Food and service were average, I usually don't find Applebee's to be my first choice to dine out at."}
{"text":"So I'm going to make this as brief as possible.. We got here and ended up having 2 extra guests so we moved to a larger table.   Table we got was already known to be wobbly...was asked if it was ok after we already sat down...so we had to test it out and it was wayyy to wobbly. So we switched to next table.   Power went out. When it came back on 1 minute later a server said \"I knew it would come back on! That always happens.\" Even overheard the manager speaking to a family at another table who were questioning why that was normal. He said oh you knew it could be anything like the winds, it's ok, it's normal. Really? We were joking to ourselves that someone could trip like a server and get hurt when the power turns off the suddenly..  So after waiting and waiting for service our server finally comes to us and tells us it's going to be longer because all the systems need to reboot.  This is all bad luck, I'm not even blaming anyone at this point yet. So she offers us chips and salsa for while we wait, but we don't receive it. We forget about it and let her just finally take our order when the system came back on. Food all arrives, we get what appears to be a plate of chips and salsa with Spinach dip. We assumed this was the chips and salsa she offered us, but turns out when I ask where MY entree is, she runs in and back out to apologize she thought I ordered Spinach Dip not the Spinach artichoke pasta(don't remember the exact name)  But for real, it was one of those things.. we waited so long so hungry, I had the exact name of what I wanted immediately when she asked me on the tip of my tongue. Everyone at my table had to laugh commenting on how I was so quick and exact about it.   So she apologizes again and offers me fries on her, and brings out my entree.  At this point we all had already dug into the Spinach dip and chips too.  Btw we needed to ask for utensils when the food first arrived.    Then we got our bill, and of course we were still charged for the Spinach dip. Had to request to take it off, i don't care that my family ate it. We were starving AND we thought it was that chips and salsa you promised us? Shoot.   Server even had the nerve to ask if we wanted change for our payment at the end(to keep the rest as tip). This is really rude. Don't ask, regardless.   Ps. It was not busy. 2 stars for the decent $1 Long Island drinks that gave us the idea to try Applebee's in the first place. Definitely the only thing they made sure to keep bringing refills for us haha."}
{"text":"For a US Chain Restaurant this wasn't bad.   The service was good & fast. My order was easy, Asian Stir Fry w Veggies & Chicken. It was big, hot, tasty & delicious. Went down well with an ice cold beer. They only downside I have with this meal was the Chicken was clearly reheated. It's had that same \"reheated protein taste\" that all proteins get.   This could have been a 5* but for the protein being reheated. Work on cooking that fresh & it'ed been a 5-Star meal."}
{"text":"Looking around for restaurants to provide reviews to, and we got to Applebee's.   We order two for $25, mozzarella sticks and shrimps. My friend had a shrimp pasta. And also chips with salsa  Unfortunately, the service was slow and the food wasn't as what we thought going to be. There was fishy smell in the shrimps which it shouldn't be. Same to mozzarella sticks, there was a weird smell to it. My friend ordered shrimp pasta but the staff forgot the shrimps. And the chips with salsa came really late. Could be better I guess. However, the french fries tasted really good.  The manager did not count the shrimp pasta and the the two for $25 was changed to half, $12.5. A nice showing apology to the customers.   I will give this restaurant another try."}
{"text":"I went in for a late lunch. The place was nearly empty, and my waitress was very nice. It was happy hour with drink specials and half off appetizers. I got two apps and two beers for only $12. All this said however, I don't think I'll ever go back to Applebee's. I went all the time for lunch about ten years ago, and boy the food quality has gone down a LOT. Everything was disgustingly salty and greasy. I have felt sick all day. Pick up your game Applebee's!"}
{"text":"Meal came quick, hot and very friendly service. Got seated immediately."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Applebees and enjoyed it quite a bit. I had the Grilled Turkey Club with Onion Rings. It was well presented, tasty and filling. The waitress was very attentive and quick with the refills on the tea and lemonade. It was quiet enough to talk business in a relaxed atmosphere. Pricing was very reasonable. Also enjoyed catching the Sports updates with TV all around!"}
{"text":"I used to work here.... *crickets chirp* yeah, I'm embarassed to admit it.  I swore I'd never come back. I got conned into for a family member's birthday.   Like many others, my 3 family members and I decided to do the 2 for $20 deal. I got the Cajun Shrimp Pasta dish, my uncle got Baby Back Ribs, my aunt and my grandma got the Riblet Baskets. For apps we got the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and Mozzerella Sticks. I'm gonna rate each dish (even though I didn't partake in each):  -Mozz Sticks: good, I would order these again. They were hot and had flavor. -Spin Dip: bland, under salted. I used to love this stuff! What happened? -Cajun Shrimp Pasta: SKIP IT. Seriously was heavy, tasted like glue. -Riblet Basket: my Gma said it \"didn't taste as flavorful as usual\" -Baby Back Ribs: seemed ok. Not as meaty as making them yourself.  On the upside of things, our server was very nice and brought a HUGE martini glass ice-cream sundae for my aunt's birthday.   To sum, this place is overly crowded, extremely noisy and the food is honestly pathetic. I've been to (and worked at) other Applebee's that have consistent service, good food and less of a wait time."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my lovely wife and shared a club sandwich and Caesar salad!  Both were excellent!  However our waitress Niki was so good and personal and happy and cute and smiling the whole time!!  We both thought she was great and will be asking for her next time!!!!!"}
{"text":"Literally only went to this place for the ribs.....and at 1:00 they told me they were all sold out. How does that even happen?? No wonder this place is NEVER busy."}
{"text":"Out of every location I have reviewed or probably will review I have the longest history with this one location. The quality of the food and the service we received have fluctuated so much over the years that it's really hard to give this location just one rating since they could rate anywhere from 1 stars to 5, so to be fair I think 3 stars will suit it fine, plus upon a recent visit this is about what I would say they were at right now, but give it year and it will change again I am sure!"}
{"text":"I have been having weekly dinner dates here with my friend for almost 2 months. The staff is always nice and on point with their service. The manager goes to each table to make sure everything is ok.  I absolutely love their sangria! They have a few to choose from, but I like the blackberry one. I have had the bourbon street steak twice in the last month. It was juicy each time and no steak sauce needed because the seasonings were perfect. Can't wait for my next date!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for wings and their half price reverse happy hour. Everyone was nice, the food was good, we shared the regular boneless wings, barbecue boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks.   However.  About a half hour, maybe an hour at most, both of us were horribly sick. All last night, and now today too. My girlfriend had to leave work she's so sick (I told her not to go into work with food poisoning...) It was probably the chicken wings. At least its friday now so we can be sick at home and not worry about working."}
{"text":"My husband left me....to work at a scout camp for a week. I had been with the kids all week and needed a night out. I sent the kids to their cousins house and went to this Apolebees with a friend because we had gift cards. We sat near the bar and had a great time with awesome food, wonderful service from Dawn, and a few cocktails.  Other than the music being a bit loud (and being turned down a bit later), we had an amazing time."}
{"text":"Service sucks. 3 people standing around by the front door, as I sit waiting for anyone to ask me if I need a menu or drink. No reason to be waiting this long, when its not busy. I was ready to leave, as someone finally came over.  And apparently, Im not the only 1 that feels this way....a party left their table after waiting longer than I had. Will make sure to never come back here again. 1 star only because I had to. Why is this dude playing with the chair at my table. Wow."}
{"text":"WARNING WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ MAY INCLUDE GRAPHIC CONTENT: I'll start my review with the fact that I had excellent service and no complaints with the food. With that being said, i went in on a Sunday for what was supposed to be a casual dining experience, then i decided to do the bottomless ribs.  The ribs are excellent, but i must warn you, stick with two orders or less! It wasn't until 5 orders that all hell broke lose! I chewed down atleast 40 of those suckers with the 12.99 special. I spent the following 24 hours on the toilet with my stomach boiling and the worst gas cramps i have ever endured in my 64 years on this planet. My SUGGESTION: Get a to go box!"}
{"text":"15 jun 18  --- no firearms allowed --- sign at door. Anti gun establishment. This is a big negative to start the meal with.  Server was an order taker and did not know the menu. My wife had the salmon. The fish was way over cooked by three to five minutes, (extremely dry). It was closer to salmon jerky. The only moisture was the very tasty sauce which was severed on the side. Garlic mashed potatoes and green beans were good.  I had one half rack of ribs. The meat was very tough and almost no sauce was placed onto the ribs. The mash potatoes and broccoli were ok. They seamed like thaw and serve items.  Both bathrooms were clean.  This was not worth the price to value. Avoid if possible, for there are other thaw and serve eatery's in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than having to wait 20 minutes to be seated when half the restaurant is open. So dumb."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch special, all you can eat soup and salad, The tried with the salad, but was still basic and soups tasted to much like the canned equivalent. Servers took a long time to bring me what looked to be pretty prepped food."}
{"text":"We visited Applebee's tonight .... I ordered the \"Riblet Basket from their menu...I was advised by our waitress that Applebee's has discontinued the Riblets ... No longer available.....still  on the menu but Gone !!! This has been a staple on there menu forever and a day. I can't express enough how disappointed in their  decision to not offer Riblets ::::((((((... If you are a Riblet Fan... Please flood their Facebook Page asking them to bring them back.   Nothing against This restaurant.  They have great service and the food is hot when  delivered to you table ... It's a  corporate decision to terminate these tasty little Riblets  I'm sad to hear .....they have \"left the building !!!\""}
{"text":"Friday 7/28/17 Walked in at 10pm to eat some dinner and did not want to sit at a high top table. Hostess was starting to seat us in the dinning area and the waiter looked shocked, flustered and he would not be able to serve us for some time. Made a comment to hostess \" They did not want to sit on the bar?\"  We turned around and left, they did not want the business."}
{"text":"I definitely would not come back based upon my experience tonight. Slow, is an understatement of the time it took for the drinks and food to come out. An hour and 15 minutes to get the meal to completion is a bit over-the-top."}
{"text":"Your typical Applebee's with decent enough service and average food. I had a side salad with the grilled lemon chicken. The chicken was actually cooked quite well, still moist and came with some quinoa and green apple slaw. My coworker ordered the southwestern steak salad and it was just ok, drenched in dressing."}
{"text":"After deciding to give this applebee's another chance we had a server, Randy, that had remembered us from when we had been regulars. The service and food was exceptional. So we decided that maybe the one visit, I posted about previously, was just a bad day.   The next couple visits were decent. Then today again we have the situation of people just walking in and taking a high-top table. Luckily there was another one available as that's what we prefer to sit at. If there hadn't been we were walking out again.  It has always been that the bar itself was the only seat yourself and that the high-top you had to be seated at. The hostess here needs new training as they always say there is nothing they can do about someone seating themselves. What happens when everyone starts doing that, you lose business as those that follow the code of waiting to be seated get pissed off and leave. If the hostess isn't controlling her area and you are ok with that, you might as well get rid of the position...  On to the food today. The food today was usual items that we order. The brew house chicken was a smaller portion than had been the first few times ordered, the chicken was a bit overdone, very little gravy to it, and the cheese that normally is on the potatoes was on the chicken instead. Now it didn't taste bad, just would have rather had the full flavor it was supposed to be and not such dried out chicken. My other party member ordered the chicken fingers platter and the fries even seemed dried out compared to normal. If it wasn't for the seasoning on the fries, they wouldn't have tasted well.  This applebee's needs work.  The 2 stars of this restaurant are Randy and Tammy (servers). They are the main reason this applebee's gets second chances and the reason it's not just a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Sister leaves tomorrow for management classes so family and I decided we'd go to Applebee's. We called ahead to let them know we were gonna have 8 adults 5 kids. They had it set up when we got there which was easy because they were dead. We got led the weirdest route to our table around the bar.....we were sat down and I felt claustrophobic!!!  It was uncomfortable. My back was facing the booths and I could literally touch them. Now I'm 5 foot flat soooo these were close!! One person could uncomfortably walk between our chairs and the booths.   We ordered drinks I had a kiwi iced tea, pretty good not too sweet thankfully. My mom had a perfect margarita and it was WELL MADE! Served in a tin shaker with a martini glass so it stayed cold.   SO I always stick with the normal items but decided to try somethin new! Baaaaad idea. We went for the 2 for $24. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was awesome. I had the chipotle shrimp pasta(yuck) and my mom went with my usual the 9oz sirloin. My pasta had barely any sauce, bell peppers, and shrimp. The shrimp were perfect. But the \"sauce\" or lack there of was not good. I don't even know how to describe it other then that really, just don't order it. It came with a bland breadstick also!! I ended up eating the shrimp from my pasta and my moms leftovers. Moms steak was a perfect medium rare and pretty tender.    We then ordered the maple blondie and chocolate chip cookie for dessert. I didn't care for the cookie but the blondie was out of this world!!!!! It's this hot blond brownie with vanilla ice cream, candied pecans, and a maple cream sauce. I'll have two more please!!!!   The beginning and the ending were delicious! The middle for atleast me kinda sucked :("}
{"text":"Two stars may be too generous for this place.  I met 3 friends here and when the waiter brought their drinks he asked if I wanted a drink and I asked for a water with lemon....I got the water but no lemon.  About 5 minutes or more later he came back and asked if we were ready and some were still deciding so he said he would come back.  I asked him for lemon a second time....  About 10 minutes went by and he finally came back to take our order.  The ladies ordered first, then my friend and then the waiter started to walk away without taking my order???  My friend looked at him and asked why he was not taking my order?  His response was oh I'm sorry I didn't realize I didn't get it, REALLY???  4 people, you only took 3 orders, is it rocket science???  So I placed my order and again asked for lemon a third time.  This time he finally brought the lemon.  When the food came one of the ladies ordered a Grilled Chicken Caesars, my friend he ordered a burger and fries and asked for mustard and mayo on the side.  Needless to say, the salad was NOT a Grilled Chicken Caesars but a regular Cobb style salad wth chicken.  No mustard or mayo came to the table either.  We let the person delivering know and he said he would tell our server.  Needless to say the server never came by to check and see if everything was ok and we had to ask another person for the mayo and mustard.  I also had to ask for more water because it was never refilled.    Overall the food was just ok, nothing I would go back for and the service was lousy.  The waiter did not pay attention to anything and I would NOT recommend this place at all.  We were all dissatisfied, but this was not my choice to go here, my friends wanted to....I will not go back unless I have to meet someone there but I will do my best to talk them into going somewhere else with better food and much better service."}
{"text":"Normally I have a funny story or tag line for my reviews. This one doesn't deserve it.  Service was bad.  Wait was bad.  Waitress was rude and had to be stalked down for absolutly everything. If you hate your job that much.. Quit.  Food took forever.   They were more interested in seating and service the tables of teenagers rather than adults.  Fine with me. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't even have to give 1 star. Worst service ever. I took my 2 children (1 teen &one 7 yr old) &my mother. Drink order took place and I wasn't informed that a strawberry lemonade isn't on the child's menu so 3.99 for a huge drink for my little girl who didn't even drink half of it.  My little girl wanted pizza and after 25 minutes of waiting for our food, they can't make her pizza so she decided on something else. They brought all of the food except my little girls food. Who feeds the adults first?! That would be our waitress Kelly F. We didn't get napkins until we were almost finished (my mom asked another waitress for napkins and the other waitress got them immediately )and we ended up with drink refills when we were ready to leave.  I tried to ask about the charge for the drink and she just giggled and said oops. Well guess what I paid my bill and oops I didn't leave a tip.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. The first time Isobel was absolutely sweet and attentive.  Could not ask for better service. Food was great. Drinks went down way too fast. We dined again last night. Another great server (Steve) took care of us, and food was great. There was a medical emergency and the staff handled it with such professionalism that most of the other diners were unaware. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Applebee's used to be delicious! I'm not sure what happened. My sister said her chicken was too salty. My pasta was cold when it came out and my loaded baked potato wasn't loaded. Three stars for the service."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Applebee's many times and am rarely disappointed. The service was great and the food was quick and good. Our server kept our drinks filled and our tummy's happy."}
{"text":"We keep coming back to this place because we always enjoy the food and drinks...the waiters are friendly and the service is good!  Tried other places, but this one's for us...Thank you for making our dining a pleasure..."}
{"text":"I have to admit. The commercials touting Applebee's new menu got me. I haven't been to an Applebee's for probably 10 years. But the commercials were intriguing. Had Applebee's really changed their menu to remain competitive with changing tastes & to compete with newer fast casual restaurants that aren't chains?   The answer is yes, but it's not impressive enough to turn the chain around. My date ordered a beer- IPA for him that was flat, and I got a glass of Cabernet (8oz for $6 and was decent) then we each had soup- French onion for me, chicken tortilla for him- and it came out piping hot and was delicious. By far best part of dinner. For our main course we both had steak- he got the 7oz sirloin with a baked potato and veggies, and I got the Shrimp & Parmesan sirloin. They came out warm, not hot. The cheese on the shrimp was a solid mess, not the melty kind indicated in menu picture. Garlic mashed potatoes were terrible- nothing garlic about them and also just warm with giant chunks of potatoes in them. My sirloin was actually good- soft and melted in my mouth. Not tough at all and cooked accurately according to the menu (pink all the way through, warm center). My date complained his steak was tough.   Service was just ok. We had to ask for silverware twice and wait to eat our main courses (maybe why it was warm?) until we got them. Server wasn't readily available, but we also didn't really need help that often.   If Applebee's wants to compete with other fast casual restaurants, they will need to represent their menu more accurately, work on faster food expediting, and evolve their wine and beer menu. Only 2 red wine choices? Most beers on tap were domestics- Bud, Coors, PBR, Miller Lite... Only one craft beer & it was flat.  Will we be back? I'm not sure. With so many other options, I'm willing to pay more for better."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 5 years and always enjoy bringing the kids. Good food and never get attitude when we come with 4 kids."}
{"text":"5 stars for everyone :) food is awesome, Hostesses accommodate to your every need as do servers. Although if you expect to sit at the bar for food or drinks with Tiffany... Expect her to ignore you. I guess she doesn't want to make money? Or hates people. As a good server myself, a little disappointed."}
{"text":"This location seems recently remodeled.  Very pleased with the abundance of local and regional microbrews displayed unusually attractively for an Applebee;s.  They had glasses provided by the brewers, and the televisions for watching sports were set up wonderfully.  An unexpected nice Applebee's experience."}
{"text":"Very depressing mood when you walk in.  Idk what else to say lol sorry Maybe retrain or new staff   **Atmosphere needs work"}
{"text":"Horrible service and no one to sit us down and had to go and look for a waitress to help us! Don't go here after 9pm. This location sucks"}
{"text":"I stopped at this Applebee's for lunch on the way to my signing in Nashville, TN. I decided to skip breakfast as there was an ice storm when I hit New York on my way out of Ontario. I was pretty hungry and the drive had been a little stressful with the weather, so it was nice to stop at a place where the staff were so friendly. I really love Applebee's because they are always conscientious when it comes to gluten free. My go-to dish is the Fiesta Lime Chicken as I've never had any issues with it.  Karlee was my server and she was friendly, attentive and came back to check often. I asked for sour cream and she was generous with the portion she brought me which adds value to your meal. The food was really good. Sometimes the dish can be a bit bland, depending on the location, but I was impressed with the food quality here. Good atmosphere, clean and excellent service. I told Karlee I hoped this wasn't one of the locations being closed, and she assured me it wasn't. Would definitely stop here to eat again!"}
{"text":"I'm a little late on writing my updated review. I want to give it 5 stars because not only did they bring back Dos Equis on tap, they've also added to their happy hour menu and a lot of new entrees. When I order my food, it comes out nice and sizzling,  and cooked to perfection. This place has really stepped it up."}
{"text":"Awful service, we sat ourselves down and ordered our own food on the table screens. That was the only way that we received our food. Our waiter didn't introduce himself, seemed like he didn't want to be there, and looked awful when we asked for some time to look at the menu. We waited 45 minutes to find out he forgot to put our order in. The only reason I'm giving an additional star is because manager Tiffany came by to check on our table and formally apologized for the inconvenience. Awful experience."}
{"text":"Operating at the speed of SSSSLLLLLOOOOWWWWW!!! We had a sandwich, burger, boneless wings, fish and chips and a steak.  An hour and half later it came.  We were so hungry that we didn't really taste the food.   I  was just ok.  Except when the potatoe was cut in to it was still uncooked.  The manager said \" yeah, are potatoes are an issue\".    There are so many other options in the area, this won't be on the go back to list."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at the Green Tree Applebee's restaurant on my way through Pittsburgh. Even though it was Saturday evening, Applebee's was able to accommodate a group of eight with no problem. They had a nice corner table available.  The waitress was fabulous! She continually came to refill drinks and update us on the status of our order. The steak was excellent. Applebee's steak has a great flavor and I had to trim very little grissle off of it. The only downfall is some of the side items have very little flavor. This restaurant offers a small children's menu.  Applebee's can be a costly trip but just prepare in advance for it.   This particular Applebee's sits up on a hill in a small plaza. If it wasn't for Google Navigation, I probably would have driven right by this restaurant.  Overall, I highly recommend this Applebee's location!"}
{"text":"So, it seems odd to rate an applebees..BUT, this one is different from any other ive been to. They have to have police presence after 10pm, the patrons they have to deal with are equivalent to drunkards in West Dallas, and the play list on their touch tunes reminds me more of a club plus they do it all with a smile on their face, a strong drink pour, and a neighborhood feel. I dont know how they do it, but keep it up guys, you're doing an awesome job!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in 10 days, and have had the good fortune of having Jillian as my bartender every time. Even though she is 7+ months pregnant she is the most upbeat, attentive,  and professional staff member I've seen. While I hear other employees gossiping while standing around, watch them pull out their phones in front of customers,  and complain about having to \"pick up the slack\" for fellow employees, she works the bar, tends to tables, is constantly zipping around and picking up what seems to be everyone else's slack without so much as a sigh, she is the reason I give this 0lace five stars, and the reason I will continue to be a regular at this location. Thank you Jillian for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Last time i was here they were playing oldies. And some old man that looked like a retired gang member was singing to it ... drunk. Thats when i decided to start going to the bars in downtown phoenix.  The food is as expected. Good. I have not had a bad meal there, just bad service."}
{"text":"Did not like that the waitress that sits you, turns this game thing around and you start playing it.  When I get the bill, I am charged for it.  WHAT????  So this is their way to make more money?  You have to sit and wait for a while for your food, why would they charge you, without telling you??  REALLY?  Well the waiter should thank them for doing that, because the 1.99 they charge the customer, comes out of the tip!!!!  REMEMBER do not conceive the customer, because we are the ones that keep your business thriving!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location sucks! I had the worst lunch day ever....so here goes my rant..Its 1 pm i have to be back at work by 230 ...sooooo.. we never  (when i say never i mean in the last two years of working ten to twelve hour days we have NEVER gone out to lunch ha ha im lucky if i get a break!)  never leave so i see this golden oppourtunity to be the business owner evryone thinks ....u know that weird dream everyone has about small business owners are rich and do what they want ..haha...so i go to outback they dont open til 4, i go to a llittle mexican place that went out of business, (its now 130) so we say applebees is right here so we go in were seated at our table where we see several customers getting pissed! well after 20 mins of sitting without our presence be acknowleged i see why...come on people a simple sorry ill be with u in a minute or hi were having problems can i get u some water, or sh*t even sorry i cant get u water im too overwhelmed woudve been nice ...but no just nothing so we left its now 150 needless to say i went to applebees in boca park and pretty much got my order and boxed it with no time to eat thanks for ruining my one lunch dream!"}
{"text":"The worst Applebee's service! First of all they took 10 minutes to take our order, then the food took 30 minutes to get there and it wasn't that busy. My plate didn't have silverware I had to go find another waitress to get my silverware I even think our waitress went home or break or something. I used to like Applebee's but will not be return to this Applebee's."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to this location in quite awhile. We were seated quickly, it was semi busy. My son had the boneless wings and a side of fries. He didn't like them at all. Said the wings lacked serious flavor. He even asked for wing sauce that came so seriously thick it grossed him out... My boy is 12. I had the grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. It really lacked flavor, my chicken was a little tough and the broccoli was not steamed enough, they were still hard. My waitress was nice... I'm up in the air of coming back."}
{"text":"I have ate here about 3 times within a week as you can tell I love their food and service is typically always decent but tonight I was truley dissapointed. The food was good as always but how is it that I have to wait 15 minutes to get my drinks when there is only 3 tables and the bartender is just chillen in the bar talking to the workers and cracking jokes. The appetizer took wayyyyyy longer than usual I had seriously thought they forgot about me and my party of 2. What realllllly pissed me off was that even though they brought us the check early the female server came back 5 minutes later and told us to pay now because she wanted to clock out already. I was not even half way done with my food. I felt rushed and pressured to leave. I didn't even enjoy my food all that well. They close at midnight and we got there at 11:02pm we just wanted to quickly eat and leave but with them taking so dang long to bring out what we ordered clearly it was bound to be 10 minutes til. I don't think I will be back anytime soon. I mean come on being told to \"pay now because I am clocking out\" yeah no. Especially when I was going to tip 30% but because of how I was rushed and everything took forever I didn't even tip 10% ."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant. Applebee's a favorite restaurant??? And then they took the kid's steak away..... Sad days. Rarely go back now. Kid steak gave exactly what you wanted without those extra sides that I never eat anyway."}
{"text":"Ok first the girl who receive the costumer she name was gaby she was upset or bad mood I don't know she don't smile no good costumer service she want to sit me on high table with my two kids when I ask her if she can give me another table low table she make a bad face and then my server she live my empty drink for almost 5 minutes till I ask her I need another drink this is sucks definitely never back of this place never ........"}
{"text":"We went here after my graduation to have something simple that we thought would be decent. Not only was the food bad, but I asked for fruit instead of fries with my meal and they literally brought me bar garnish in a cocktail glass. Not good. On top of that, they had music playing so loud, which happens....but it was SCREAMO music. It was awful and we had to leave as soon as we possibly could because we could not stand the loud screaming any more. It was a terrible experience and we will never go hear again. Very disappointing for a place that is supposed to be family friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the time I had with my family here, Applebees is not the same I really miss the house salad they had, there's something missing not sure but oh well, my wife & daughter had the bourbon chicken & shrimp with mashed potatoes they enjoyed it, my son-in-law had the Whiskey Bacon Burger wth fries he loved it, I had the classic cheeseburger & fries which was better than what I though it was going to be, now I did like how I was able to add the crispy fried onions to it which it made it taste better.       The server was great had a great attitude, joked some very attentive to everyone's needs even taking care of another servers table, some servers would just say I'll get or let your server know, but no they asked her for water & she brought it out to them without any hesitations, at the end of their meal they tried to tip her & their regular server, but she refused the tip she said it was her pleasure, now that right there she gained a lot of respect from the patrons around, so with that I gave an extra tip above my normal 15%.     Overall my dining experience was very pleasurable, I wished I got her name, but when I emailed corporate I did describe her also gave my receipt info I know they'll know who she was..."}
{"text":"Good food, don't have to wait to long, playlist is all out of whack (one minute you're at a rave then your thinking about your ex), children friendly but overall good service."}
{"text":"Samantha (she goes by Sam) is great & deserves extra tips every time. She made our little family of 3 feel like we were the only ones in the very crowded Restraunt. Reliable, prompt service with great tasting food Sam makes the place!!!! She gets it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a date.   Had the steak soup and new spicy wrap. There was no food descriptions but our waitress made sure to define everything for us.  Once I received the soup it was great. The taste was spicy and zesty (going perfect with the new wrap).   We were both very cold. I would suggest turning the AC to around 75-78. Felt around 65-70.   Thanks for a great lunch date and tasty food."}
{"text":"My first visit to the chain in years. Not exactly fine dining but this was open until midnight on weekdays.  I had roast beef sliders and a bowl of French onion soup. The sandwich buns were mushy otherwise everything was fairly good.  Service was very good. Meal clocked in around $15 with tip which I think is 3 or 4 too high. Much more extensive menu than Denny's along with a bar if you happen to need a late night fill up."}
{"text":"Following up on our visit on 2-20-12, the fall-out of our anniversary dinner got significantly worse during the week. Eventually four of our six kids had stomach problems, one of them for more than a week. Regarding myself, I got stomach pains two nights later so severe, that I decided to go to emergency in the middle of the night, just to be sure. They did all tests (ultra-sound, X-rays and CT) and (fortunately) concluded that it was probably not more than a very irritated stomach. Two days no food, flush it all out and I should get better. During this process the manager of Applebees called, following up on our complaint. He apologized profusely and they did refund us the money. Maybe we would give them a chance again in the future. I doubt it after this ordeal. We have never had a bad experience like this before and prefer to avoid any reminders."}
{"text":"Medicore food.  Salad might of been edible but they ruined it with diced tomatoes.  Ever heard of wedges that people can pick out if they hate tomatoes?  I guess I should of asked. Slow service. The restaurant smelled old and musty. A tired chain that should of closed its doors years ago."}
{"text":"Honestly, I used to love this place. But then they did a new promotion and it was horrible... And all Of a sudden there was a new 9.99 meal that I Decided was crazy  Delicious and thought no way could I get a delicious steak, but then I decided after trying their 9.99 deal before, then decided wow this is delicious. Twice btw!!! And thankfully my bartender jacob was on point with my drinks which weren't many. #greatservice"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came in to pick up an order that was placed 45 minutes in advance had to wait an hour. Clearly the servers did not want to be there and gathered together and complained about the tables they had. Terrible overall experience will never eat from this location again"}
{"text":"Worst experience there, it's usually good. When you don't eat chicken on the bone and you get a bone in your chicken. Hmmm"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, the food was good but is very processed.   Had the 2 for $25...Hubby had Triple Crunch Scrimp which was nice with the coleslaw, the fries were just ok.  I had the Cajun Chicken & Scrimp with potatoes onions and mushroom  which was served the same way fajitas are served.  Food was very hot and chicken was just a little dry- but having steamy hot food is a plus in my book! Nina the server was prompt and offered suggestions. The manager, Karen stopped by to check on us- which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10.   The hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink  I finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables.   It wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience."}
{"text":"The rating is specifically for the food. First and foremost they have NO vegan options. Seriously it's 2015. Secondly all of the food we got was EXTREMELY salty. Like My throat burned. So ya there was really no taste except salt. Probably won't be coming back . Sorry."}
{"text":"I work at a Red Robin which is a similar restaurant to Applebee's, so I'm super understanding and lenient of restaurants. However, the visit to this Applebee's was probably the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my entire life. When my boyfriend and I got there the hostess was having a conversation with her coworker. When she saw us come in she turned around to face us, looked us up and down, then turned around to continue their conversation. She didn't even wrap it up, they completely finished it before she even turned around to greet us. I'm a hostess so I know if I would've done that the manager would've had my ass. She put us at a table with no dessert or drink menus (things we were interested in ordering) and no ziosk (my boyfriend and I always play the games so that's another lost cost to them). The waitress was nice and that's the only reason they deserve a 1 Star and not zero stars. She did however skip us around 3-5 times when she made her rotations, when we actually needed things. The managers and other employees were having very very LOUD DRAMATIC conversation in the MIDDLE of the restaurant. They were screaming and laughing at each other and distracting everyone in the restaurant. We got the appetizer sampler and the chicken in the quesadilla was so pink we couldn't even eat it, the chips for the art spin dip were so stale I couldn't eat that either. I got the firecracker shrimp cavatappi, I had ordered it at other Applebee's and it was always good but when it came out this time I was disgusted. We ordered dessert to go and when we opened the dessert later at home it wasn't even packaged or closed all the way and the portions were half of what they were supposed to be. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Never ever again ! First off our server brittanylooked like she spent all her off time in a tanning bed . Tanerexic much? She was young and stupid. When I first got there I went into the bathroom, as I walked in she walked out of a stall and passed the sink, not even bothering to wash her hands! So gross  She was dull and boring , no personality what's so ever. And I'm pretty sure she had half a brain. She bothered me and my boyfriend to much. I don't mind attentive servers, but I felt like I was having dinner with her and my boyfriend. She had these long acrylic nails on that made me cringe knowing all the germs that are under those and the fact that her fingers were literally in my food.   When she brought my salad out my plate had finger prints all over it and had caked on old gunk on the bottom of it. I sent it back and it took her almost 15 minutes to get me another salad, which the plate was still dirty!   The manager came out to apologize, nothing was comped, even though when she brought my salad I had to eat alone due to my boyfriend had already finished his food, I don't blame him. We were both starving. I will never go there again.  It is not clean, and the entire staff besides the bartenders seemed like a bunch of eighteen year old bimbos. Food is mediocre , but the service is horrriiibleee!!"}
{"text":"It's your typical Applebee's. Standard American food. A-OK quality and atmosphere. Let's be realistic, we can't have high standards when we go to establishments like these ;).   Unfortunately, this particular experience was noteworthy in a negative way. We had a terrible server :(. Whether servers are new or not, if they are not ready to be on the floor, there should be more training before they're working on their own. We were this particular server's ONLY table and it took way too long to get our drinks, soup and salad, and our meals. She seemed lost and kept forgetting things. I've been a server and bartender for almost 14 years now. If you do not have the capacity to take care of 1 table at a time, this may not be the job for you?? Needless to say, the experience was frustrating and we must've been there for nearly 2 hours just to grab a \"quick bite\"."}
{"text":"We visited this Applebee's location last night.  We were out running errands, it was getting late, and this location is right around the corner from the house.    The food is average for a chain.  You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.  The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!  Our waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.      J's order - Fajitas.  My order - Oriental Chicken Salad Baby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)  Our server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.    REALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.    J's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.    Drinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!    Then we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.  In fact they seemed pretty pissed.    I sure hope we get a different server if and when we ever return."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! ! After 5hrs in the Calgary Zoo with 3 kids we decided to take advantage of applebees \"kids eat for free on Wednesday \" offer when my meal was less then expected not only was i offered a second meal that was amazing (mac and cheese) they picked up the tab for my meal and the service was some of the best ive ever had !!"}
{"text":"Was greeted upon coming in here the host was friendly and polite. The waitress was awesome and knows the menu"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere open late and decided to come here. We sat at the bar with Aaliyah and she was amazing. Super attentive, nice and bubbly. We got our food extremely quickly and it was awesome. Happy hour prices you really can't find anywhere else. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. Our waitress was very young but very friendly. Bourbon street chicken and shrimp was a little bland, but decent. Would come back :)"}
{"text":"you cannot beat the deals that your neighborhood restaurant offers.. half off appetizer during happy hour and their 2 for 20 + appetizer is an awesome deal. if you do not know what to eat, Applebee's offer a large variety of american food and did i mention that they are almost everywhere in town?? however, how some people say, you get what you pay for,... their food is good but is not a 5 star restaurant.."}
{"text":"Careless management staff, un responsible bartender. My fiance and I are regulars until today. We were sitting at bar and witnessed a intoxicated female patron with her 2 toddler daughters get over served. I spoke up to management if they were going to do their job and stop serving her and or make sure that she would not get behind the wheel with her 2 kids and they did not seem to care instead they kept serving her. I was told my manager on Duty Maranda that \"she was a regular and that she was good\". A responsible bar manager would not continue to serve a patron that was intoxicated especially with 2 children. Shame on you Applebee's I thought you guys promoted a family atmosphere, I will never step foot in your establishment again after seeing your careless actions today thank god the local PD got involved and took issues in their own hands."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Employees don't seem to be coordinated and don't know their number tables. My server ran around the restaurant with our salads before it got to our hands. Food was okay could've been better and our server could've been more attentive . I don't think I'll go back to that apple bees . They should get their stuff together"}
{"text":"If I could leave a 0 stars I would. We came in on a Sunday afternoon, and were treated absolutely terribly from the staff and a nearby patron. When we walked in, we gave the employee at the front (Her name is \"Luxury\") our group number. She asked us if we wanted a table or a booth. I told her a booth. She looked at my mom and I and said, \"Are you sure? The booths are pretty small.\" I said a booth would work fine. She continued to question me, so I asked her \"What are you trying to say? That I 'm fat?\" She tried to back peddle, but the insinuation was already out there. I told the Manager (Danielle Lyons) what happened, she asked us to stay so she could make it up to us. Against my better judgement, we stayed. On three different occasions our food was brought out either cold or FROZEN!! The Manager Danielle tried to handle the situation, but began avoiding our table which meant I was left without food at all while the rest of my family ate. I asked to speak with the General Manager who allegedly made the second frozen dip, to voice my concerns. He was very lackadaisical and ingenuine with his responses. He sounded like a broken record saying, \"we have already comped your check and you say you are too scared to order anything else, so what can I do?\" That's when a drunk and angry patron on the other side of our table decided to intervene. He started yelling out loud about our situation and butting into our business when he had no idea what had happened to begin with. I was collecting information from the general manager and a phone number for his boss before we left, then the drunk guy tried to pop up from his table and threatened us with physical violence. I had to push my elderly mom out of the way because she couldn't see that he was trying to get up out of the booth at us! Meanwhile, the GM (Frank) comes back to the table and sat the drunk guy back down, but tells US to leave!  We were already leaving anyways, but to be called fat coming in, served cold or frozen food repeatedly, and then asked to leave...I was shocked. Not to mention, the phone number that the GM Frank gave me to his boss was a fake number!! They have lost my business forever. No big loss for us really!"}
{"text":"I'm allowing one star for the hostess, who was very nice. Subpar service from our waiter Michael. When my father asked for another beer, Michael said, don't you want to wait for your meal? He had 1 beer prior. Really?  My mother asked for her House Sirloin medium rare, father asked for medium just a bit pink. Both steaks were blood red and inedible. There was so much gristle, you couldn't chew through it. I tried a piece and couldn't chew it. And I have all my teeth! Lol.  The waiters and waitresses took the corner booth to eat and talk. We tried for 5 minutes to capture anyone's attention to no avail. When Micheal finally stood up, his response to the fact that the steak was too rare and inedible was \"What do you want me to do about it.\" Loaded question my friend. I'd have been my normal sarcastic self had my parents not been there. They cooked the steak longer but you can't get away from gristle.  I'd say these two steaks might have been the exception however, the couple next to us had to return their chicken. I guess the cooks like everything rare!"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 9/100  I treated my mom here on Tuesday to lunch as part of our Tuesday-Mother-And-Daughter-Day-Out (Papa fell prey to the flu, unfortunately enough). She was open to checking the place out since I told her about its all-American atmosphere - country music, can't beat that! - and $20 lunch specials.   As soon as we got there, we were seated at a booth and Debbie, our server cheerfully took our drink orders in no time while we flipped through the menu. The last time my father and I came here, we ordered the 2 for $20 lunch with spinach and artichoke dip for appetizers and 2 entrees - Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp as well as the 7 oz. house sirloin (we're pretty dedicated carnivores as you might see) with unlimited tortilla chip refills! However, my mom and I, trying as we may to watch our diet, opted for something healthier.   She eagerly narrowed her focus down to the $7.99 lunch combo deal with a choice of half a club sandwich paired with french onion soup. I, on the other hand, got the creamy parmesan chicken served with steamed spinach with mushroom rice pilaf. It was delish, so much so, that along the way, my mom asked for a slice at my chicken, then another one, then another one until she noticed all the barbecue sauce and bacon oozing out of her sandwich that she decided she wanted what I had. I willingly took in her remaining sandwich in exchange for handing her my dish. Debbie then came round looking all shocked and smiled 'Looks like we had a change in minds did we?'   And we weren't done yet. My sweet-tooth was a-callin' for a brownie bite (served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream) and we both shared it to our tummies' contentment. That was only an additional $1.49 by the way! Try it out folks!"}
{"text":"I love Happy Hour! The staff is always super friendly, the food is hot and fresh, the happy hour prices can't be beat. The Potato Twisters are my absolute favorite. Every time I'm here, the staff is always eager to get me anything I need. I'll be back, many, many times over."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this location but they are always polite and the food is very consistent.  The facilities are always clean and the service is good.  Great location for a quick, convenient, affordable bite to eat."}
{"text":"Tried the Car side to go, they came right out. My order wasn't ready when they said it was going to be so Valerie offered me a drink while I waited.  No issues!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Applebee's on Camelback/Central. It was horrible!!!!! It took me almost 50 minutes to sit and order my food. I ordered the 3 cheese pasta with chicken..It was garbage!!!!!! The cheese sauce was soupy and the chicken was cold and hard to chew. I had the flavored ice tea which had a huge amount of syrup in the bottom of my glass. Finally, one of the servers complained to customers that the new owners had cut their food allowance from 50% to 25%.And that the new owners didn't care about the employees and producing good food for customers.Anytime you visit a establishment where the employees complain about where they work..well its probably not a good idea to eat there..."}
{"text":"Back again tonight. I am a bit of a captive audience as I am on foot and.as I said in my prevoius review, I am not.here with a car, and this area of Pineville is NOT pedestrian friendly. Ashley was my server tonight. Ribs (1/2 ) rack....more than enough...garlic mashed potatoes, and yup.....garlic beans. Yummy. Double garlic. Very nice meal, reasonably priced and great service.  I can ask for no more than that. Cheers, and my thanks..."}
{"text":"I had a customer who really wanted to come here for lunch.   I was hesitant but went along for his sake.  The waitress got our waters and order.  The food take over 15 mins and my burger was barely warm.  She never asked to refill my water and seemed too busy! Will not come back!"}
{"text":"This was a very bad experience at Applebee's my baked potato was under cooked the green beans were not cooked and no flavor. I ordered mushrooms on my steak and when it arrived it had four tiny Little mushrooms on it.  When the manager Ken brought me my new plate all he said was more mushrooms and walked away.  No apologies nothing.   I work in hospitality and I would never treat my customers like like this.   Shelley was a delight.  If I come cack here I would sit in her section.   She made a bad night better"}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain. But this little local Applebees has a really great staff who really are kind and helpful. Late night can be tough to find good food and a crew serving it that isn't trying harder to close down the kitchen than they are serving their customers. This little Applebees is an exception to that rule. The staff always is helping to make the food fresh and hot and doesn't rush your order to their agenda. Plus the menu has expanded and become actually tasty when it comes to dinner meals late at night.   I have had a couple amazing servers at this local Appleseed- Curtis and Kristen. Ask for either of them if you eat late here. Great people!"}
{"text":"They have a gluten free menu. It's very short, but if you ask for it at your table they will bring it to you.  The staff is always pleasant here. This restaurant is right by work, so I go often enough to know that it isn't just bells and whistles. The food choices are relatively limited for me, but the food that I've received has been good. Not great, but good. I'd say the prices are a little high for what you get, but for the speediness and the great service I don't mind.  Thumbs up for Applebee's!"}
{"text":"Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had.   We walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight. We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa.   Next time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have been to Applebee's twice in one week.  This place has been recently renovated and although is a smaller Applebee's, it is open and has a nice friendly feel.  Wait staff very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We came but we're too late for the lunch menu and they didn't have the drink I wanted.  Unsure about this place. Tried to get a little extra queso for my nachos but they wanted $3.50 for an ounce and a half of it . Not cool"}
{"text":"Been in her three time a now and every time it's the same result. Slow restaurant but with long drink and food wait times. Today waited 25 mins for drinks and all it was was two kids sodas. Never again will we be coming back here."}
{"text":"We went to this place at 5:45pm on a Sunday. Lots of open tables, but it took 5 minutes for someone to greet us at the hostess stand. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait. No problem. The reason it took so long, though, is because nobody is bussing tables. We finally got seated at 6pm. At 6:15 nobody had stopped by to take our drink order, so we left. The frustrating part is that the bad service wasn't from a lack of staff - there were multiple servers huddling around the bar and kitchen area. This place clearly has a lack of management/leadership and it shows in the lack of service. Given the myriad of other mid-priced American dining options in the area, I'd pass on this Applebee's."}
{"text":"Bartender was very attentive, process was quick since I was short on time during work lunch. Food was okay for the price level."}
{"text":"If it was up to me I would keep my eating out away from chains. But with the fam and they picked this place the other day. Service was bad. Real bad. They have these new computers that you order apps and drinks and play games on. The whole process was more of a pain than anything and somehow my son charged our table $2 for some game. Then It took 15 minutes to confirm I paid for our bill on the thing. I didn't even bother disputing the $2 game charge. Avoid chains!"}
{"text":"I consider this a really nice nice restaurant. The food awesome, and the prices are affordable. The servers are always polite, and if you have a problem with your food they with take care of it.  I come here with my family, and our favorite thing is the steak--so juicy and good we don't even use the A1 sauce provided. The atmosphere is awesome, definitely one of my favorite restaurants to came and eat at during and occasion, or just whenever I want to eat some great food. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the  chicken and shrimp . Shrimp was good . Personally did not care for the flavor of the cajun chicken. Also have the brownie bite desert . Wish more restaurants would have small deserts such as this . All in all it was ok ."}
{"text":"Apple bees is good have happy hour Tvs in the bar area for your enjoyment of sports! We like coming here to relax and get a great bite to eat and have a cold one! Here we are again love it!! Coronitas margarita? Awesome!!"}
{"text":"These type of chain places are noy my jam- It was OK- they do have some pretty awesome Happy Hour Specials on drinks and food- that being said, i would come back, but only for those deals and only with girlfriends for dinner and drinks during HH- otherwise, you are getting crap."}
{"text":"Been here several different times trying to if maybe ill get better service but no luck. One time I went with a group of eight and the server was just not in a good mood I wish I could remember her name so I can put her on blast. She was in a really bad mood it was late probably trying to get home. She was really racist as well. The food doesn't taste goo either it just taste like plastic EWWW. will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I like the new remodeling. It's bland and not original. But the staff is friendly and their sangrias are good."}
{"text":"I am in town on a business trip and this place is awesome. The prices are wonderful as are the drinks. The quality of the food is wonderful as is the service that is provided. They are open late and even have karaoke! This will surely be a go to spot when I am in town for now on."}
{"text":"It's been a good while since I last hit an Applebee's. When I was in high school my mom would take me one night a week. It has a sort of nostalgia to it when I think of those times. Now I'm all growed up and I stopped going for a long time. There's a litany of restaurants within short distance of work and I have been trying a new one every chance I get so Applebee's had its turn recently.  This Applebee's is in the usual location - right off a highway and right by a mall. I imagine they do plenty of business. Most people think of their food as pretty basic middle-class appealing dinner options. I thought they had a good variety, though nothing that really makes them stand out from restaurants in the same string of options (like Chili's, On the Border, TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesdays, etc.). Soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, steaks, chicken and some sea food options. The usual.  I had the Thai lime shrimp salad and it was on point. Just the right amount of zest and the shrimp felt like they belonged there rather than like they were added. Overall the salad was crisp, crunchy and fresh. I combined this with a southwest black bean soup with steak which was also quite delicious. They included crackers with the soup but I bet they'd do better by adding some tortilla strips instead as part of the standard dish. Even a dollop of sour cream could really complete this.  The service was great and the restaurant wasn't packed for lunch time on a weekday. Also, the prices match the volume and quality of food in my opinion. I will definitely keep them in the running to visit again for lunch some day once I've tried every other restaurant in the area at least once."}
{"text":"Such a bummer that I have to change a review from really good to bad. On 09/06/2016 I placed an order over the phone to go for my husband to pick up once he got off work. There isn't an applebees near us in South Chandler and this location is close to his work. When he got home as we were ready to set everyones dinner we were missing one full kids order and half of another kids order. My husband headed back with ALL of the food because we werent going to eat our food cold or eat our food before our kids did. Took it all back for them to remake the entire order. We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.            I give this place 5 stars because I walked in during lunch hour hoping to get an easy to go order since I was in a hurry and although at first one of the waitresses said it was going to be a very long time she did go double check and the manager and a server came out and said they could do it in about 15 min. As I was standing there waiting I was definitely not ignored several servers passed by me and asked if I was being helped and the bartender even offered me something to drink while I wait. Kuddos to them for the effort and thank you for filling my order very quickly on such a busy hour."}
{"text":"A consistent chain with a menu that leaves me with many options that takes me a moment or two to decide.  There are so many that are colorful with veggies and so many that seem healthy.  This pleases me very much.  It was lunchtime and they have specials in which you can choose 2 from different categories for prices by category.  My husband chose that option and had 1/2 a grilled club sandwich and a chicken Caesar salad and I had the crispy chicken salad.  We were both satisfied with our choices and finished every bite.  Service was good, quality of food was great, prices were fair."}
{"text":"Came in for a family dinner. Pretty empty when we got in here. Our server was Omar, he was relatively bland and at points seemed generally uninterested. Food was alright the three cheese penne was good probably my favorite thing we got. The breaded chicken tender pasta (from the 2 for $25) was okay although there was a bit of sauce on the bottom that was watery and made it not as good as it could've been. Omar brought refills as soon as they were needed which was nice and attentive on his part. For Dessert we got the triple chocolate meltdown and the Apple crimi cheesecake or something like that. Both were very good and probably the best part of the whole meal.  All in all the service was 3 star food was 4 but not strong enough to raise my review. Typically Applebee's experience where neither the food nor service really amaze you but you know you won't have necessarily bad food or service so you aren't thrilled or scared to go there."}
{"text":"Ordered car side to go... forgot my oriental chicken salad.. and when I called shes like oh yea we have your cesar salad here...? Umh you mean oriental? Then when I picked it up you can tell they really did have a cesar waiting for me.. brown lettuce with oriental toppings.. well the problem is the original oriental salad has cabbage on the bottom.. and not parm cheese in it or roman lettuce.. so yea they half assed my 12.00 salad.... not tooo happy... haven't been back..."}
{"text":"One bartender for a friday. He is really busy but still.. i ordered my food and it had to come out and sent back twice before i said forget it ill just eat it. The nachos which were wrong seemed like they stayed in the warmer to long and werent very good. Ive had them before at another location and they were so good....  ive been sitting here now for 20 mins with an empty drink no offer for another or even asked of i want something else. We ordered a coronarita he asked did we want it on the rocks or frozen we say frozen he brings it out on the rocks and walks away... smh  Came to celebrate a friends promotion and my week at work. We Wont be back to this location... Time for the check and leave.."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. We won't ever be coming back to this location. The 31 year old Bartender is so loud it's annoying -  telling his life story - every other word is profanity . We've been sitting here for 20 minutes and no one has even took our drink order."}
{"text":"We visited this Applebee's ten months ago.  At that time we said we'd never go back.  Then, the food and the service was lousy.  My thought was manager needed to work with staff. However, we gave it a second chance and my opinion has changed.  I don't think the manager needs to work with staff.  I think the manager needs to be replaced with someone that will work with staff.  There's a reason there are so many negative views regarding service.  To begin with our server had no clue what was on the menu.  She didn't know where to find the side dishes on it or what or where the soup was listed.  We're guessing she was put on the floor not knowing what the restaurant served.  She wanted to take our order without us knowing what our choices were.  We were pretty frazzled just dealing with her.  Finally we suggested she get someone who did know.  So she finally ran off to find someone else to help (i.e. server #2).     Order was finally taken as we had opted for the 2 for $25 choices.  This time the food was mostly good.  Most places you're offered dipping choices for onion rings, etc.  Not here.  We asked for ranch dressing to dip and was told we got BBQ sauce or they charged an extra 50 cents.  Not the idea so much of the amount but never have ever had an upcharge for a ranch dip replacement.  We waited for what seemed like a long time for our onion ring appetizer.  When it did come we were sure it had sat in the kitchen for a while.  Our meal arrived almost on top of the onion rings.  The meal was cooked perfectly but the service was so lousy it was hard to have a good attitude.  We were asked how it was by server #2 after we were finished.  Server #1  never stopped to check and the question by server #2 was as she was walking by.  I'd say it was a little late to do much about it if the steak wasn't cooked right.  Tracking down a server to get their attention so we could get our tab was another issue.    So, now we're saying again, never again."}
{"text":"This Applebee's is so crowd I hate going there. The wait is alway ridiculous. Which I don't really understand why. The food is bland and cold unless you get a skillet steak. The happy hour is okay bit even then it still classified as bar food at best. My recommendation is find another place."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Applebee's and the food was okay and the service was okay too. Our sandwiches were falling apart but my salad was great. My hubby soup was lukewarm and very bland. It was good for lunch but a little disappointed with food and speed of service."}
{"text":"I have eaten inside this place once and ordered curbside to go 3 times. Im giving this place two stars instead of one because the two for $20 deal is pretty good and the food was also good when i ate here. Now the bad..... The curbside to go is awful. I work at a retail shop within a five minute drive from here and we order food for lunch 5 days a week. I ordered the to go 3 times from here. The first time we got what we ordered but didnt get any silverware to eat with, which isnt a deal breaker since we have extras at my work. The second time they forgot to make one of the meals and i had to sit out there in my car until they made it and finally brought it out. The third time they forgot again and i was in a hurry and didnt notice it until i got back to my work. How hard is it to make an order and put it in the bag? Never again will i order from there!"}
{"text":"We go to this Applebee's quite a bit, but last weekend was by far the worst experience we have had.  Usually the service is bad, but this time the service was great and the food was horrible.  I order the same thing every time and it came out fine.  My husband on the other hand got the ribs and they looked like they had been sitting for days and then reheated with some BBQ sauce on top.  He could barely rip them apart and they were hard as a rock, with no meat on the bones mind you.  We first ordered the tortilla soup because it's our favorite and it came out cold.  Not even luke warm, but we ate it anyways because we were starving then gave a heads up to the waiter they might want to check to make sure the pot is on.  Then came our food, like i said my husbands ribs were hard as a rock.  I hope the manager showed the cook how unacceptable that plate was.  We probably wont be going back for a long time."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak salad to go and when I got home no steak grilled chicken instead. I called spoke with the manager and she laughed at me and offered to mail me a gift card which I never got"}
{"text":"Not so happy, happy hour at this Applebee's.   Happy hour is awesome typically at any Applebee's, but the amount of time it took for us to get everything we ordered was disappointing. When we were first seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even acknowledge that we were new customers waiting to give our order. Once we ordered our drinks it took another 10 minutes to have them delivered (2 beers isn't a mix drink that a bartender has to create, right out of the tap, should have taken 5 minutes tops). When our waitress finally delivered our drinks, she ran to the table dropped the bees off and darted away, at this time we were ready to order our food and she didn't even ask us if we were ready. After flagging her down we were finally able to order our food. After about 35 minutes we flagged her down again for she had walked past our table several times and didn't give us an update about what was taking so long, nor ask us if we wanted another round of drinks. Once our food finally came out, things didnt get any better. The buffalo wings were tasty, but my steak was dry and tough. The mashed potatoes and broccoli that came along with my steak wasn't awful tasting, but also nothing special. My friend ordered a burger and said the same thing. It's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it.  Im sure the kitchen gets backed up during happy hour, but that is when the waiters and waitresses should be on their toes checking on their tables to put the wait for food at ease. At this time the cooks need to make sure they still care about food quality and not worry so much about just getting the food out the door.  *Currently looking for a happy, happy hour place*"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday because I know if you hit up any other place in Anthem its at least a hour wait.  Should of stayed home......waiter seemed lost in the sauce.   Did not get place settings at first.....then asked for straws, that also was a chore. And for the food.....its lent so we went with the Jumbo shrimp basket.....shrimp and fries for 12.99. I was like cool get a big basket of shrimp and fries cuz its applebee's.......not so fast son! I got about 8 medium deep deep fried shrimp and a handful of fries.....really! I always step up and defend Applebees saying you get what you par for...but after this night I was better off getting a Fish sandwich and fries from Mickey D's!!"}
{"text":"I stopped eating at Apple Bees awhile ago not due to this location but due to other poor service and very poor food quality. I have seen lately that Apple Bees is trying to revamp and do more of a pub style menu which i think is good so my husband and i decided to give it another chance and see if it has improved...   Unfortunately everything about my dinner experience yesterday sucked..  First off the waitress was like a walking zombie, NO Personality what so ever. Didnt greet us, didnt tell us any thing about new items on the menu. Not a single smile. She CLEARLY wanted to be anywhere but work and we were obviously a huge inconvience to her evening... It made us feel very uncomfortable.  My chicken was over cooked and dry as a bone! I asked for ranch three times before the waitress remembered to bring it. My husband ordered a margarita and it came in a martini glass.. With an olive?.. It was strange and his burger was over cooked and flavorless.. Overall I was disappointed.. But really the awful and awkward service was the worst thing.. We were very uncomfortable around her. def won't be back. ."}
{"text":"Some things sound good at first. Like slamming a slurpee on a hot day to cool off, or visiting Applebees. But after slamming the slurpee you get a condition known as brain freeze, after visiting Applebees you get a serious case of remorse.   A long time ago this Kansas City export expanded like mad across the country. The food was meh, the drinks were ho-hum, but for some small towns when they got their first Applebee's it was a sign they had truly arrived. All of that is nice but today's Applebee's is just not all that. Take this Green Valley location which sports a dated building that really needs a top to bottom date with a cleaning crew. Let's look closer at the menu which only has a few classic items. The rest of it is filled with experimental stuff, the type of menu items that screams we know how bad we suck, we're going to toss all this stuff on the menu and see if anyone is curious enough to try it more than once.   I got sucked in here when someone got stuck in a nostalgic flashback and thought coming here was a good idea. And hey, if they're footing the bill I'll take a trip down nostalgia lane every once in a while. The key words there is once in a while. Some memories are best left in the past, and eating at Applebees is one of them.   If you're hungry and are reading this on your mobile device in the parking lot debating where to go, you're really not looking hard enough. You have lots of good options within 3-4 stoplights of you. Even a Big Mac at the McDonalds across the parking lot would leave your stomach and wallet a lot more satisfied than enduring the Applebee's experimental menu experience.   2 Stars: Only because the servers work hard and don't deserve a 1 star review."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to the big box franchise restaurants like this, but we had family in town and it was easy. Won't do it again. Our order took much longer than expected. They forgot somethings that the kids ordered. My wifes meal looked like it had been dropped on the floor, kicked around, than tossed into a carry out box.   It really seemed like the place was being run by high school kids. Maybe one adult manager? I don't know. There were like 2 or 3 people in front of me for carry out and the kids working were complaining non stop that it was never this busy and were running around like they didn't know what to do.  Overall just not a great experience."}
{"text":"14 available tables and was told she can't seat us due to too many parties being served at the moment because of happy hour???? Wtf if Applebee's can't handle a Happy hour then I suggest either new management or don't have Happy hour due to not being able to accommodate the high pace."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town to eat at! Love me some festa lime chicken! And 80% of the rest of the menu! The staff is super nice!"}

{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had at an Applebee's and I am a frequent customer since the age of 14... I am 30 now I just couldn't believe it... My husband ordered a burger and it came with no garden so when we asked for some veggies look at whthe sliced tomato they gave him... ppl can choke off of that end piece that is literally #TRASH"}
{"text":"The staff here is super unprofessional. Cussing and being OVERLY happy that their shift is ending. There's a certain level of respect that employees should have IN FRONT of guests. Even though I was the only one sitting at the bar, it's not cool to be loud and obnoxious in front of people that don't work there. It's actually pretty annoying"}
{"text":"We came, they sat us down and 12 minutes later  nobody came to our table. Its a Wednesday night so it isnt that busy. There is no excuse for a server to not come to our table after 12 minutes and we not even have water."}
{"text":"Great place to relax after work and best thing is they open late.I ordered dinner special 2dishes for $25 and served with appetizer!!wooooow Great deal everyone. Nice drink selection great service  Good place to hangout over the weekend or after work:)"}
{"text":"This gets 3 stars, like all mediocre down-home, corporate, American bar & grills.  The chicken strips, like those at Friday's and Cheddar's and Chili's and Bennigan's and whatever the hell else (+ 's), are reasonably good and the honey mustard dipping sauce has just the right amount of high fructose corn syrup.  The reason I'm reviewing this place, however, is not to heap another three-star review onto Applebee's long tradition of receiving three-star reviews.  My motive, like that of so many other Yelpers, is to tell a strange personal story.  We went here for Smacko's 21st birthday party.  For this monumental day -- indeed, the date that will probably always be the most relevant for his life -- Smacko decided to steal my idea and do a family restaurant barcrawl.  A family restaurant barcrawl works like a barcrawl, except that you only hit the bars of family restaurants.  Champaign's strange microcosm of a suburb, North Prospect Ave, was the site of this 7PM debauchery.  We hit all the staples: Ruby Tuesday's, O'Charley's, Red Lobster (which has a special place in my heart for not ending in apostrophe ess), etc.  Applebee's was, as usual, a forgettable portion of the evening (thus receiving a 3 star even when only being compared to his mediocre peers; this is truly a homogeneous group of depressing dead-ends where dreams go to die).  We were kicked out of Red Lobster for being a drunken disturbance, after which someone began vomiting in their bushes.  Ruby Tuesday's, on the other hand, was a beautiful experience.  Not only were we allowed to stay and create chaos; the manager actually brought us an array of appetizers for free -- salty, of course, for they were brought to keep us drinking over-priced long islands.  So, to summarize: if you ever plan to get drunk in the early evening at a bunch of generic family restaurants, all of which probably serve chicken fettuccine, be sure not to exclude Applebee's, because nothing is more generic than that.   EDIT:  oh wait, i guess it wasn't entirely forgettable for everyone.  Spritz, upon reading this review, gave me the following addendum:  Spritz: You neglected to talk about Ducky projectile in the stall and then I was peeing in the stall next to him Kyle: didn't hear this one rofl Ryan: and all of a sudden I see liquid coming from Ducky's stall and I was like \"Shit, Ducky puked you puking on the floor?\" and then Smacko yelled from by the urinal \"NO DUDE IM PISSING ON IT THO\" Kyle: lolol Ryan: That was in Applebee's"}
{"text":"I love Applebees.  Not this one.    Every time I'm hear something gets screwed up.  I'm not kidding.  It's only this Applebees.  On the flip side, the servers are nice and I've gotten to try a lot of renditions of a bbq cheeseburger because it's always differently wrong when I go in.    The restaurant has a nice layout and usually has whatever game on tv that should be on but the service is S-L-O-W and I think they may be doing it so we get so hungry while we nibble on our arms we order more food when they do come around.    Like I said above, I'm a huge Applebee's fan.  Just not this one."}
{"text":"Went there with a couple female friends late night for reverse happy hour and the male bartender was rude and made derogatory remark towards my female friends. When I called the manager over she was sympathetic but I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Worst applebees to go to we had ordered a classic burger and it was so nasty it had no taste and made me really sick my kids didnt even eta the food it tasted like it was a frozen patty we ended up paying for are bill and went some where else to eat the service was also very poor we will never ever go back to this location"}
{"text":"Guys, the $1 margaritas aka dollaritas for the month of October are REAL! I can't remember the last time I've been to an Applebee's but the promise of cheap margs got me back in the door!  The dollaritas are a little on the sweet side, you can really taste the sour mix they use, but after a few I could tell they contained some alcohol too.  For the price they are just fine if you ask me!  On this trip to Applebee's the Indian's happened to be playing.  Our waitress told us during Indian's games most of the appetizers are half off, so we obviously had to order one.  We got the pretzels and they were really good with both the cheese and honey mustard dipping sauces.  In addition to half off apps during games, they also have a late night happy hour with half off appetizers and drink specials after 9 on weeknights and 10 on weekends.  I would highly recommend for a cheap late night snack and drink!"}
{"text":"Terrible service sitting at the bar for happy hour. My glass sat empty for long periods of time.   A passing waiter actually saw the empty glass and gave it to the bar tender. Sad."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken salad. Wish they would add a grilled chicken salad. Trying to make good choices with my dining, and fried chicken strips on a salad is counter productive. Waitress/bartender was on the spot.  If you go between 4 - 6 don't sit facing the window, the Sun blinds you like a Gamma Ray. I asked the bartender if she could shut the blind as the sun was reflecting off a wind shield and boring a hole in my face, I pointed at the window.  She proceeded to shut all blinds but the one that had the super nova coming through."}
{"text":"AB's as I call it is coming up. They have crazy nighttime events (wii, karaoke, late late night happy hour), which I've not partaken in, but have noticed the ads for  I'm surprised at the lack of love for this location, as me and my Frat frequent this location often (because we like to eat and they are easy/great to set up fundraisers with) and I've never had a bad experience there.   What prompted this review is that I'm currently making chicken gorditas which reminded me of the wonton tacos that are BOMB.COM/AMAZING. I usually get the lunch special for $5.99 and call it a day.   Anyways, ya it's not some crazy hip local place, but it's been consistent and good imho."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was bad. From the time we got there we only saw our waiter 3 times total. She took our order (forgot my drink), then once our food arrived , I still had no silverware. The last time we saw the waiter was for the check."}
{"text":"Y'all be wanting me to write too much,but today Service is real slow I guess because it's a Sunday but it is not crowded in here worst day ever but overall I like the spot..."}
{"text":"Never ever eat here!!! Worst service I have ever had. When we said something there was one excuse after another!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite, go to places.   Let's get real ,it's a franchise folks!  I was here after a high school basketball game. Great glass of Cabernet and 1/2 price appetizers.  I caught up with an old friend. We laughed and talked for 2 hours, Jenna our  waitress couldn't have been more accommodating.  The appetizers came out, fast , hot and quite delicious. Try the fried ,fresh, green beans. they were  surprisingly delectable.  They have simple, inexpensive food that is served in a neighborhood setting.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"This is a daily place we go to when I don't feel like cooking. LOL .   Service is always great! Never had a problem with food. Restaurant is clean.  Today, we had Taylor, I believe, who is the bartender. She is awesome! Thanks for making our lunch fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst Applebees experience ive ever had. We came on a busy friday night, and as soon as me and my two friends walked in, we were stared at by everyone. I am not racist by any means, but being the only 3 white kids in a room full of black people, we immediately felt uncomfortable. Once we were seated we had to wait 20 mins to be helped, drink orders werent even taken and our lovely server comes up to us and says \"well if I dont take your order you guys will be sitting here for longer.. do you know everything you want?\" We ordered our food AND drinks and she came back with styrofoam kids cups 10 mins later saying \"theres no more glasses so just let me know when you need refills\". We felt so disrespected having waited for so long we just said fuck it and left ?"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite places to go. The guys in the back get a little noisy but the food is always good and the staff are super nice! I would definitely recommend coming here often."}
{"text":"This location is very close to my house but honestly when you go to one Applebee's you go to all. The only difference is the service.   We usually get great service and this past time that I went the server was very slow and a bit rude. I'm not sure if it was me but I didn't like the food this past time I went either.  My favorites were the wonton tacos( not vegetarian friendly) and the spinach dip. This past time I went I got veggie nachos and a pomegranate margarita. It wasn't the best to be honest.  Experience was ok but I'll definitely got back for a delicious lava cake."}
{"text":"First time at this Mesa, AZ Applebees. Wonderful service, thanks Kailani! My moms salad was made just right and my chicken tenders and fries were perfect. We splurged and had the triple chocolate melt desert. Wow! Loved it! I'm from Charleston, SC and I will be backi to this Mesa Applebees when I come to visit!"}
{"text":"It started with the restaurant on Higley... went there for lunch and the menu & table absolutely filthy... told the server & she says \"well that's from the night people\" so we suggested that \"we\" were the day people and they should have the place clean...won't go back!! Then we decided to give another chance to Gilbert & Baseline... Lunch time again, the kiosk on table absolutely filthy looked like it had never been cleaned grime, old food, sticky everywhere... probably sucked on by toddlers.... again server says \"Oh yeah they are supposed to wipe them down every morning\" then I looked around the place... grime & dirt everywhere... all over the baseboards, walls, wooden fixtures... filthy & black. NOT suitable for eating area!!!! dirty dining should pay a visit!!"}
{"text":"The place had a smell like an old stale theatre. The food was blah so I had to salt everything. Soup left a metallic taste in my mouth. Prices were not bad. Had the all you can eat soup and salad. Waitress was not very attentive. Ordered a bowl of one soup and she brought me the wrong one"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in we should of just left. It took 5 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge us with no wait. When we gave our names, mind you it was just me and my husband her response on wait time was, I'll let you know. The restaurant was half full but it took 15 minutes to seat us. Waiter started off great took our order right away and the. It then went awry again. People say after us were getting there appetizers and drink refills. Waitress comes over and says there was a problem our order was never sent to the kitchen. Mistakes happen I get that no harm done. BUT it took 25 minutes for them to acknowledge the mistake as me and my husband sit there twiddling our thumbs. She puts the order in but gets our appetizer wrong. It was nachos... So 45 minutes happen and we get our appetizer and she tells us the manager will be over to talk to us and discount our meal. Never happened. So we get our entrees and finish them and have to sit another 15 minutes after staring at everyone else getting service when we are ignored. We finally got a box from a different server we flagged down as ours was no where to be seen. Ours finally makes her way over to us and gives us our \"discounted\" bill. They took off 5 dollars. I kid you not. Never going here again."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend after church. She picked Applebee's. As we walked in the hostess held both doors for is which was nice. Then she led us to our table. She explained the piece if equipment on the table. It is the size of an iPad. You can order appetizers, signal for your server to come to the table, pay your bill, or for 99cents you can play games.  Our server came and introduced herself. She let us know what was available to drink and the drink special. She came back and took our order. She was very pleasant and attentive to us.  I ordered the salad that came with black beans, corn, tortilla strips, and a jalape√±o dressing. I asked if she could recommend a different dressing because I can't eat spicy. She recommended a MexiRanch and it went really well with the salad. There didn't seem to be a lot of chicken on the salad but it was good.  My friend ordered the Chine Chicken salad with grilled chicken. Her salad had more chicken than mine. It is a favorite of a lot of my friends. She enjoyed it greatly.  We were there for quite awhile catching up. It was nice to be able to relax and chat."}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant quite often but the food and service went down hill. It had been awhile so we decided to try it again. We were pleasantly surprised. I ordered Crispy Brewhouse Chicken. It was a stacked meal. It was served in a bowl. On the bottom was a foundation of homemade mashed potatoes. They had skins in them which added to the flavor. Then there was a large piece of friend chicken breast on top of the potatoes. The chicken was hot, crispy, and juicy. On top of the chicken was a dark brown gravy that was excellent-not too salty and it didn't hide the flavors of the food. Then there were crispy onion rings on top. They were thin and crispy and the perfect topping for this dish. It was a great meal!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of many chain restaurants but on a busy workday  I look forward to visiting Applebee's for one reason only.... Their daily bartender Kim C. Though I don't drink alcohol, I can always count on her to already have my Iced tea sitting on the bar for me by the time I sit down, she knows exactly what I'm going to order or at least have some great suggestions! She has such a fun personality, no matter how my day is going I can always count on her for a great laugh!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. The services is extremely slow, our food was served almost an hour after we ordered."}
{"text":"Whitney w. Was our server.   She was inattentive, busy cleaning glasses behind the bar while there is already a bar tender.  Took for ever to get water on the table. Every time we asked for something she seemed annoyed. Maybe we were her last table who knows... but this location is horrible.   Even our cheap dollaritas came naked no salt no sugar no lime, nor did she ask if we wanted any. Disappointment. While tall jolly green giant manager walks around with his saggy pants on his cell phone"}
{"text":"I did a take out order tonight and I was just going to let it go, but the wings were so bad, I'm really pissed!  I don't know what they did, but I can only imagine that they took the time to let the  neighborhood dog take a piss on my wing order.  I don't have a really high expectation, but these where terrible!  I should have just ordered them from a pizza place.  I'm sure the cook is just pissed off about making minimum wage and doesn't give a damn about what goes out out the door."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Applebees in the first place and this experience sure solidified my thinking.  Let me start with our experience ordering.  As we were ordering our meals the manager came up to our table (I believe his name was Zach) and accused us of \"playing the same song over and over on the Jukebox\" ummm what?!   We ordered the chips and salsa for our appetizer, salad, and a burger.  It literally took them 25 min to bring out our chips and salsa and another 20 to bring out our entrees.  The salad looks like a salad on the Wendy's dollar menu and the burger was so plain it was unbelievable (see my photos).    We asked for ketchup and got it after asking two other servers.  We asked for a refill of our chips and never even received them.  I'm not sure how his place is still operating but I'm sure it won't be here for long.  I can tell you one thing, I now understand why it seems most Applebees are closing."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night, neighborhood spot. They now have jukebox and music was so loud we were at table in the bar closest to the juke box, don't recommend if your going to communicate don't sit at that table or near it. Service great food worth the money."}
{"text":"Some person gave me a gift card so I went for a couple cocktails and I brought two family members for a weeknight dinner.   The atmosphere is very cookie cutter, dated and full of LOUD families and spazz kids. The booths are big which I like (though it really bothered my aunt).  The cocktails (I've tried 3) are all WAY too SWEET!!! Ugh! You know it's serious when I say avoid any mixed drink or cocktail at Applebee's and just stick with beer if you need an attitude adjustment (the wine list is like 4 total and mundane) or water.  My guests were taken with their entrees. My aunt ordered the half portion of Grilled Shrimp 'N Spinach Salad: spinach, bacon, roasted red peppers, red onions, toasted almonds and hot bacon vinaigrette topped with grilled shrimp. She really liked the shrimp and found the salad refreshing. My only grandma ordered the Fiesta Lime Chicken, which she LOVES and always orders at Applebee's (according to her). It is grilled chicken in lime sauce, Mexican ranch sauce (?) mixed with melted cheeses blanketing the breast,  tortilla strips, seasoned rice and pico de gallo. It was a hearty portion and she aced it except for the pico de gallo, which she thought was too hot and tried to eat with a spoon...maybe she thought it was mexican cole slaw?.   I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp: cajun-seasoned grilled chicken breast served on a skillet with blackened seasoned shrimp, garlic and thyme, with fried red potato bits, saut√©ed onions and  mushrooms. It was all very queer. None of it tasted CAJUN or hot or blackened. A lot of it tasted pre-fab and/or frozen, and what was seasoned were strange flavor profiles... but it was good. The chicken was juicy however OILY in the skillet.. I liked the garlic and thyme on it and shrimp; complimented well. I would ask for extra sauce next time. The potatoes were really crispy! I'm naughty. . . I dunked them in ranch on the side. The only things that were duds were the onions and mushrooms (i like both in general, just not stale, ill-prepared, greasy, and mushy like the ones served here).  I would return and would order any chicken and/ or shrimp dish again. Plus, family likes it."}

{"text":"We live right across the street so we have been trying to take advantage of Applebee's menu and happy hours. I like that Applebees has \"bad food\" if I want. Their wings are good. And If I want to watch my calories, their light fare menu and salads are good. The host DJ has a super happy friendly personality. Our most recent server was Larry and I liked him."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby came here for a quick dinner after hitting ToysRUs. He got a sirloin & baked potato. It came with a side of grilled veggies that were a bit soggy. He loved the rest of the meal tho. I ordered a new item on the menu..fajitas! Chicken & steak combo for 11 bucks! They came out sizzling on a bed of rice with lottsa onions & peppers. It was such a huge portion..big enough to have shared! The server was a bit on the slow side. My iced tea was empty for half of my meal...glad I had water cuz those fajitas were hot! I took off a star for that..normally I wouldnt but he was checking on all the other tables around us..but not us."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my 9 year old son...He loves this place.they have a decent kids menu and ample portions.....I had the baby back ribs....pretty good although a little on the pricey side...The manager walked by 3 times asking if everything was ok.... service was very good...All and all pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend and I and her toddler son decided to come and have dinner and were welcomed immediately by a friendly host. We were seated momentarily and ordered waters soon after. We ordered off the 2 for $20 and got the Cheeseburger with fries and got the riblets basket and paid extra to get the platter with 2 more pieces and cole slaw. We also upgraded to onion rings from fries on the platter.  Everything was great! The food all came out hot and tasted amazing. We ordered a couple long island iced teas to go with our meal and they did not dissapoint either!!  Denise was our server and she was amazing as well! The food was great, but Denise made the whole experience that much better. Thank you! Will return!"}
{"text":"first of all i want to say that i was sick when i went there, and around there i couldnt find any place that has soups. i wen there and had soup, one the chicken tortilla and the othere was the tomato basil soup, both soups were really good and the service was awsome. Nicole E made it possible to have what i wanted and she suggested hot tea over iced tea because i was sick."}
{"text":"I've been to this applebees a few times and have always enjoyed the food and had no problems! The best thing about this location is their waiter Sean (a really tall skinny guy with blonde hair) who is funny, upbeat, fast, and just makes the experience so much better! He is the poster child for great customer service! I hope his manager sees this because he definitely deserves a promotion!"}
{"text":"Ended up ordering sriracha shrimp and chicken wontons as an appetizer, those are two of my family's favorites. Tried the spinach and artichoke chicken cavatappi pasta, its was tasty, something I would order again.  although the only down side to this experience was our server. She asked for our drink orders(we only wanted water). She was very judgemental about my parents not wanting to order alcohol. Weird. Kind of gives weird/bad vibes to our dinner."}
{"text":"Dh and I went early for Good Friday happy hour about 4:15. Got a table right away in the bar and got menus but had to ask for the happy hour menu. I ordered a nice Bloody Mary and Dh had a couple of rum and cokes! The chicken Wonton Tacos we're light and good as were the big onion rings. But we also ordered the fried green beans which we were fine. Those each cost like $4 but drinks $7. I like the Ted pad and played trivia but that was 1.99. Also with the Ted we we ordered a drink and billed and checked out our selves...kinda cool. Good service and the mgr stopped by. Was fun playing games!"}
{"text":"When you're Yelping at advanced/expert/hardcorps difficulty levels, the negatives stick in your mind longer. It doesn't matter if there are several hundred nubile dancing Oracles handing out gas coupons along with your pinor noir; if ONE of them farts on your arm reaching for the grapes she's feeding you as she's pouring fragrant mead from the 24k gold goblet, it's all over. Such was the case at the usual emergency fallback place, the Apes on Rainbow and Spring Mountain.   I tagged along at Sam's Club with some friends to piggyback some items when I realized (sudden, quick, painful) that I was omgfuckingstarving. Since this Ape's had treated me well many times in the past (and I had Gift Card ftw, boing boing) I might as well recommend a quick stop. Our party of five featured several freshly minted dieters, so they were pleased to see the items on the Weight Watchers menu. We ordered the Garlic Herb Chicken, Steak and Portobellos, and sizzling Fajitas with Steak and Chix. I got myself steak and chicken combo as well, which is my Usual.   Once we started tearing into it, the silence instantly let me know that something was amiss. \"Is it just me, or is it way too salty?\" one of my dining companions said. Yes, and it wasn't just one dish; all 5 entrees and sides came out like the prep cook had just completed a triathlon, realized he had to be in at work, ran in shirtless and started loving the meats and poultry con mucho gusto.  All mastication and conversation ceased and I realized with great sorrow and regret that I had, as they say, \"thought out loud.\"  Maybe it's a diabolical scheme: You can't eat it, you lose weight!  But really. It was way too salty. I was starving and determined, so I poured water on mine, got extra napkins and kept eating. But the less guerrilla folks were having none of that.  And when I brought up the scene in \"Waiting\" a few moments later, it was On Tha Floor, Out Tha Door time.   Extra star for the amiable waitress and the Gift Card. But just because something is free doesn't necessarily make it a Good Value. How jacked is that, huh? Next stop In-And-Out....."}
{"text":"I only come to Applebees for their Happy Hour Special at the bar on Monday-Friday from 3pm-6pm! Appetizers on the menu are half off!! Beer and wine are half off also! What more can you ask for??? Each item is like $3-$4 after discount!"}
{"text":"My first and last foray into an Applebee's.  One star ONLY because the service was exemplary.  The hostess opened the door for us upon arrival for lunch.  Although I came here under protest, that small (corporate focus group inspired) gesture made me let my guard down and think \"Maybe it will be at least OK...\"  The waitress was quite pleasant and had the illusion of sincerity pegged.  (And in reality, it she did do a good job service-wise.)  My hopes for a adequate meal were not yet dashed.    Then the food came.    Well, it looked like what it was.  Industrial  food put together by machines.  The only seasoning was salt.  I had ordered a chopped sirloin.  It had the shape, flavor and consistency as high school cafeteria food, but saltier.  It was covered with a special brown gelatinous slime that could be best described as \"salt sauce\".  Now,  I use quite a bit of salt. I usually salt everything, but this was like the shoreway in February.  The lukewarm baked potato had frozen butter balls in it to cool it further.  The ceaser salad was made in the same place they make airport food.   I'm surprised it did not come with a  plastic envelope of generic dressing and croutons.  Actually, it probably originally did.     Gross, gross, gross.  I cant believe people eat this stuff.  And there they were, all around me, eating it all up. Now I'm starting to think that the staff must be Stepford-Waiterons to serve this crap.   Wretched."}
{"text":"This was the worst Applebees I've ever been too. We got a booth as requested but that was the end of the good luck. We sat there and read the menu back to front and front to back and still no sign of a server. There were kids running around yelling and screaming either side of us and we could hardly even talk. We debated for a few more minutes on what to do and thought Qdoba wasn't far so still with no sign of the server we decided to leave. I told the host on the way out and he said oh well, have a good night and didn't even care. I've been to 30+ applebees in more than 15 states and would never suggest anyone come here unless they change things."}
{"text":"Ordered car side to go. Didn't include any sauces or dressings needed. Green beans were mushy. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Stopped there for an appetizer and a drink. I waited for 10 min at the bar for the bartender to finally come over and there were no other customers. Was not offered a menu just a drink.  I ordered a bloody mary which was the worst I've ever had. Only slight alcohol (which I watched them pour) and all juice. No hot sauce, salt, pepper or garnish. Then I recalled liking the chicken won ton tacos from another store. It was good. I witnessed the manager who had no clue how to use the computer ordering system and the staff there were all dressed down like they were laying around their house."}
{"text":"The place was just about empty yet we waited 10 minutes for us to actually acknowledge our existence.  After placing our order, it took 20 minutes to get our drinks which were delivered a minute before our meal.  They had the drink orders wrong and one of the sides for a kids meal was missing.  We were told they didn't have anymore and offered a substitute which we declined.  The table behind us just got up and left after getting no service.  We should have taken their clue.  Not sure if they were short handed or incompetent. We also had to repeat our order to the waitress three times and she still got the drink order wrong.  Don't come here.  This place is a disaster."}
{"text":"It's Applebee's. Let's get that out of the way right now- it's a chain, the food isn't gourmet, and if you are expecting to be blown away, you will be disappointed.   That said, the food is good and the server I had on Monday was awesome. It's a shame I didn't catch his name, because I'd request him. He was attentive, friendly and personable, and patient with my party's disorganized ordering process.   I was there around lunch time, and it was busy but not packed. Everything was clean (including the bathrooms), and everyone I encountered was friendly."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times with varying levels of success.  None have ever been great. We actually hadn't been there for about a year when we decided to give it another shot a few nights ago. We walked in about 8:30pm and it wasn't busy. Stood around for at least 5 minutes before we were seated. Once seated we waited 8 to 10 minutes for our waitress to even come over. We placed our order and when the waitress brought our food she just set it down and quickly walked away. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal except one of our meals was the total wrong thing. She was no where to be seen for several minutes. In the time we were waiting I took a bite of my steak and spit it back out. It tasted bad. It was gray looking inside and had a funny taste. So the waitress finally comes back and we tell her one of the orders was wrong and grabs a menu and procedes to debate what we ordered. She just wrote down the wrong thing. We ended up not eating. Our meal was ruined. This is the worst Applebee's ever."}
{"text":"The foods was average but still great, with little bit above average price if I compared with the other restaurants around this area.  The services was great and fast although you need to wait a while for foods! The atmosphere was casual, family style with a lot of TV screens everywhere and most of them in sports channels.  The have happy hours around 3-7 PM."}
{"text":"Service is horrible today. So very slow, but tons of waitresses standing around or sitting down eating. One server was rude and threw utensils on our table when we asked for some since the table didn't have any. Very unfriendly. Last time coming to this Applebees."}
{"text":"Applebee's is so gross. I really don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I had no choice, I was basically forced at gunpoint by co-workers. The tables were sticky, the service was slow and my food was served cold. I didn't even bother complaining because I expected it. Bleh. Don't order the tomato soup!"}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar rude they always act so busy  with no one at bar at all never once asked me if i wanted a refill so half way threw my dead plate no drink either. Anyway   After starting my dinner never once asked if I was ok or liked it...  Starts off with smallest side salad I have ever seen  Terrible tasteless over cooked bourbon Chicken dish chicjen was dry no flavor, burnt shrimp burnt frozen style potatos Tasteless grilled oinions with canned mushrooms  I have never had such bad food at Apple bees  Only reason I ate it,  I was starving and I never send food back......"}
{"text":"I always love a trip to the neighborhood Applebee's in South Phoenix when I'm in town. The recent remodel looks great. Service, drinks, and food were excellent tonight!!!"}
{"text":"First off all i can say is it's time for a remodel. The carpet is worn and the walls are covered with sauces and stains and the more you notice the more disgusting it is. Kurt our waiter was friendly and always smiling however you would think he was rationing out the soda as my glass spent more time empty than full. The service was slow but friendly. The triple bacon burger was average and the fries were good. I would recommend staying away from the sangria as it tastes like an average red wine. If you want the best sangria go down the street to Carraba's."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family and as always everything was good. Waiter was attentive and food came out quickly. The tables were clean as well as the condiment bottles on the table. Will definitely be back to this Applebees."}
{"text":"The food is average and the service is TERRIBLE! The manager does nothing to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for happy hour. I wanted some drinks and food. I was expecting the same service and menu I get back home in Nashville. I was slightly disappointed when I realized things were not the same, but I ate here anyways.  First thing first, although we were seated promptly, it took forever for the waitress to come by. Thankfully, when we were seated, we were given a menu, so when the waitress did decide to drop by, we already had our meals picked out.  I always order some form of chicken pasta. Here they have a Three-Cheese Chicken Penne dish that usually pretty awesome. I went with that, luckily, my friend wanted the same thing so we decided to just get the 2 for $20, that way we could share appetizer too. Also, because it was Happy Hour, we ordered Mozzarella sticks along with our meals.  The Sticks came out 1st. They looked great. I really appreciate that the cup for the marinara sauce has gotten larger. As opposed to how the cup used to be, they actually gave us almost enough sauce to get us through all of the Mozzarella Sticks. Progress!  Once we were done snapping pictures and dug in, we noticed that not everything is as good as it looks. The sticks were warm but the cheese wasn't melted. They were very hard to eat. They tasted like a fried box covered in marinara sauce. They gave us like nine, I was hoping at least one would be worth the money. Nope, all terrible. The sauce was the best thing about them. Sad!  A couple minutes later, the Buffalo flavored Boneless wings came out. I must say, I'm a sucker for their wings. I'm not a big wing person, UNLESS, they're boneless and are being served at Applebee's. I love them because they're always cooked to perfection and seasoned with just enough spices to keep me coming back.  I hate anticipating food that's usually incredible, but when I hype my friend or myself up to go get it, it's disappointing. With that being said, those damn wings were horrible. If it wasn't for the ranch dressing, I would have flipped. It's sad that I have to mask dishes with sauces. The wings were overcooked so they were hard to chew. We only got a hand full of them but they looked like the cook chopped a wing up and made 3 out of it. Don't get me wrong, we did have a couple large wings but most of them were really small.  Just after the wings were dropped off, the entrees came out. Same as the other dishes, the meals look cool, a little dry, but never the less, decent. Once I got the waitress attention because she always on the move, I asked for more Alfredo Sauce. It took her a few minutes to stop back by to say that it will be right out, but by that time, I had already tasted the Pasta. It was cold and disgusting. Well, the noodles were cold, the chicken was warm and the plate was hot. All messed up! Not to mention the serving wasn't enough to fill up a 6 year older.    I told the waitress that the entrees were terrible and she said that she was sorry and offered to bring something else out. We declined because I don't like sending food back. I told her that we will just pay for the apps and she took the plates and walked off.  She came back out after 3 or 4 minutes and bought the check. She had discounted the entrees and the Mozzarella Sticks were half off, being that they were on the happy hour menu, but the Wings (also on he Half Off Menu) were listed at full price. I asked the waitress, once again, after I got her attention, if she had made a mistake. She told me that because we didn't purchase a beverage, we couldn't get the Happy Hour prices. I was confused because she had discounted the Sticks already. She then told us that she had done us a favor. She said that the Sticks were not suppose to be discounted either.  Subsequently, I asked for the manager. I wasn't opposed to purchasing a drink but I didn't like the way she just sprung things on us, and then talked to us as if we couldn't afford our meal. I'm not sure if that was her intentions but my friend and I both felt slight offended.  She went on and on about how she was doing us a favor, although we had already asked for the manager. She then took the receipt and said that she will see what she can do. After about 5 minutes, she came back out with the receipt. Said that the manager had said that he would add the discount this one time, but next time, we would only get the discount if we purchase beverages. I said that it won't be a next time and then she repeated her statement. I gave the woman a $20 to get her away from the table. She brought the change back and we left. I never did see the manager.  I know that it's not her fault that the food was horrible or that the rules are setup how they are, but she can control her attitude. She was just too snappy for my liking. Plus she was a terrible waitress, she couldn't even keep our water glasses full.  I've added this place to my \"You better be lucky I wasn't starving\" list."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor of this location in the past year.  The last time, we ordered carside to go on 11/28/15,  My son decided on a full pepperoni French bread pizza with a side of yogurt and strawberries.  I decided on the shrimp pasta from the low calorie menu.  The other adult purchased the steak and potatoes meal.  We also ordered a \"choose 3 appetizers\" sampler platter: mozzarella sticks, wonton tacos, and smores churros.  Everything was cooked, there was condensation on the plastic containers, and the food was as decent as if we orders at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am giving two stars so that hopefully things can change at this location.  This location used to kill it so I am sure with some minor tweaks things can be better for us all.  The last two times we have come here things were totally off.  I think they need more staff when busy to help with table requests.  The last two times specifically it took forever to get things that were requested, like plates for appetizers we had already received or refills of beverages.  It took forever to get our entrees this last time.  My mom didn't get quite what she ordered and my food was a little burned.  There was no way we were waiting for it to be fixed.  Granted, the night was busy but we have been there when it was super packed and things have gone off without a hitch. If I am remembering correctly, the times that service was phenomenal included a visit from the manager to see how things went.  Maybe they need a strong manager on duty all the time.  I don't know if there was one when we were there last time.  It sure didn't feel like it.  Also, help to refill drinks and take out orders to tables would be appreciated.  Empty glasses and cold food suck!  Also, this last time we were charged for the table games even though we never touched the machine.  They did take it off the bill, I will give them that.  Please fix this Applebee's!  You are closest to my house and right now my husband doesn't want to go back to this location and Applebee's is his favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was so bad, we walked out, and this was at 9:20PM on a Thursday night, not exactly the dinner rush.   There are plenty of other restaurants in the area, so save yourself the aggravation."}
{"text":"When dining at Applebee's I am not expecting haute cuisine and black-tie waiters as part of the experience. I have a pretty low bar to pass in these situations yet the Champaign Applebee's fails to make the grade. Food is so-so, but the real problem lies within service. Confused orders and slow delivery of food are pretty much the rule here, but I had a humdinger one late night when it seemed like no one wanted to wait on customers in the very busy dining room. 90 minutes wait time without any apologies is just unacceptable, and that wasn't just our own party. Good thing there's alcohol available-you'll need it. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre. Happy hour beer selection is not good. PBR and BUD LIGHT? Okay... Also, they should call it the \"Southwestern Steak Wilted Salad\" pre-made and frozen to perfection, then thawed out. Boneless wings. Eh. Even the waiter was bland. My 6 year old liked the chicken tenders, though. That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. But it's Applebee's. They haven't been good since I didn't know what good food was. Do yourself a favor and go up the street to Oregano's or Olive Garden if you want a good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"We have gone here often in the past , today's visit will be our last visit. The prices have gone up, the portions have gotten smaller and it seems the quality of the food is not as good. Four of us dined this evening, 3 ordering steaks that had no flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were bland as well. On top of all of that, we went early to beat the dinner rush and the service was HORRIBLE. We had to ask for silverware after the food came, our drinks were never refilled and the waitress never asked how anything was. Time to find a new go to place, because this one is DONE."}
{"text":"It took about 10 minutes before anyone came over to take our order.   Staff mot very welcoming nor attentive to who still needs drinks and so forth."}
{"text":"So we walked in to be seated and the bartender looked at us said nothing.... waited for the host/hostess we seen no one. Other workers seen us and didn't say anything and continued to work, still waiting as the bartender still looks at us. Another worker comes out sits at the bar and stairs at us as well? She does nothing at all and the bartender doesn't tell her to come cater to us either! At this point I'm getting heated cause this is ridiculous at this point. Bartender says something finally which the girl walks around and passes us to pick up 2 dishes and walk to the back and then come back to SIT BACK DOWN! Then another worker comes from the back sees us and then starts walking towards us but sits with a customer and has a chit chat with him! Customers behind us who walked in maybe 3-4 mins asked how long we've been waiting and we say 10 mins with no help or anyone seeming to care. There was no sign saying to seat ourselves or anything so then more people come out and say where's the hostess/host? So a lady finally comes and seats us and we are annoyed at this point. But luckily she was very sweet and nice and it made everything fine.  But I mean come on the bartender should be put on blast as well as the other workers who weren't doing anything and sitting talking to customers and the other one looking at us sitting at the bar. I wish I would have asked for a manager that day to tell him how unprofessional the night bartender was and the employees who seen us standing there and didn't do jack shit."}
{"text":"The Worst.  This place is a perfect storm of a terrible wait staff and terrible food. Burger and chicken were over cooked. Mozzarella sticks were ok. Can't complain or send it back if no one checks on the table.  No idea how this place is still open"}
{"text":"Delicious steaks and nice interior. Friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"I can't remember if I've ever been to an Applebee's before but it sure felt like my first time! Came in a few weeks ago around 3 PM and were seated as soon as we got in.   I ordered a blue Hawaiian because it sounded amazing and I've seen other people order it at other locations! The cup was HUGE!!!   It actually took me a while to decide what to order because there wasn't a lot of variety/options. I decided to get the Cedar Salmon with maple mustard glaze with a side of fries and string beans with bacon. The salmon was cooked to perfection. I was not a huge fan of the maple mustard because the mustard seemed to overpower it but I was pretty satisfied with the size of the fish! String beans were okay and a little salty and there was not as much bacon as I thought there would be. Fries weren't anything special either, and I hate to say it because I've never had a bad experience with French fries but they were a little too salty for me.   Our server was very accommodating especially when it came to my mom's order but I never caught her name! She was very attentive and made sure we were okay and satisfied.   Not sure if I'm going to come back here, I feel like I won't really know what to order the next time I come back. But I will say that I caught a glimpse of the happy hour menu so maybe I'll come back for drinks!"}
{"text":"We don't normally dine at Applebee's because there tends to be lots of screaming kids. We were pleasantly surprised this time around.  Their menu is ok, nothing that really stands out but we each found something we wanted on the 2 for $20 menu.  It comes with your choice of appetizer and you each get an entree. Trust me when I say it is a lot of food!   We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they came cold. Our server was super quick to get us new ones. I ordered the 3 cheese pasta with chicken and my husband ordered the crispy shrimp. Both were pretty tasty but too much to finish.  The best part of the meal was the service. We were never out of drinks and the food came really fast. Everyone was pleasant and it made for a great experience.  It's not a place we would frequent often but it did what we needed it to do and we were in and out in about 30 min!"}
{"text":"plain jane american food that i feel most people should be able to cook at home. can't think of anything that stands out."}
{"text":"Bad service. We walked & got seated. Our waitress never came to give us water & never took out order. After waiting over 15 minutes we walked out & left.   Found another Applebee's  on Eastern Ave. Great Service.."}
{"text":"Apple bees is normally good. They have good food and service. Though this time it wasn't. 3 out of the four of us got burgers. We got: 2 American classic's, a brunch burger, and chicken cavatopi pasta. First thing that was wrong was that I ordered the American classic with nothing but cheese,bacon, and pickles. It came with secret sauce on it. Next they forgot the chicken cavatopi. We waited for a while and had to remind them. The only reason this place isn't getting a 1 star is cause of the amazing service. If you go there request John as your server."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. It's hard to really say much about an Applebee's location. They tend to serve the exact same food with the exact same sort of decor. It's a very standard presentation. That said, this one is clean, the waitress was nice and attentive, and they've done something new with their nachos which, while there's less on the plate than there was a few years ago, it's that much more tasty. Something with seasoned beef, I think."}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm and it was dead inside (Thursday night). It seemed to be extremely loud for it being so dead. We got sat next to this family of screaming, food throwing animals. I felt so bad for the waiter. I would have felt worse for him if our service hadn't been so bad. When we finally got our food it was kind of cold. Like on the verge of being warm for 2 more minutes and then being blah. He kept forgetting our waters and other beverages. I really did feel for him because of that table but there wasn't enough people in his section that could justify not getting water when we needed it.   Just a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. It was busy but not crazy busy-- but you would think so if you ate there. It took forever for a server to come to our table, and when they did they were out of margaritas (the reason we came) and wings. It took forever again for our appetizers and drinks to show up and they forgot our waters. The people at a nearby table were served raw chicken and I overheard them talking to the cook about at. Apparently a big batch of food was undercooked and had to be thrown out. Something's really wrong with this restaurant. I don't think it was our server's fault at all, seems like management is probably awful. It could always be an unfortunate coincidence though!"}
{"text":"One word summary :  Mediocre  We have been to Applebee's many times in the past, but every time we've gone there's been some aspect of the meal that makes us not go back for a long time.  We had reached the threshold of boycotting it long enough, and one of my kids wanted to go there because they saw their commercials recently, so we took a chance and met for lunch on 02/05.  Service:   Our waiter was reasonably attentive.  Not outstanding, but nothing to complain about either. Food: We ordered the pretzels with beer cheese as an appetizer.  The cheese sauce was average, but the pretzels were pretty tasty.  There were only four and they were long and thin, so if you have more than a couple people in your party you might want to consider ordering multiple.  The kids got chicken fingers meals.  In times past, Applebee's had pretty good chicken fingers, so this was a fairly safe choice.  Again, pretty average fare.   My wife and I ordered the lunch combos.  She got french onion soup with a sandwich(?).  I generally don't get salads much for lunch, but I went out of my box and got the Thai Shrimp salad and the \"Clubhouse Grille\" sandwich.  The sandwich portion was a small half sandwich on Texas Toast with what appeared to be chicken, bacon, and ham.  The portion of the Thai Shrimp Salad was good, and it had a good taste, so it was definitely the nice surprise of the meal.  Overall, just an average visit.  I felt like we could have done much better at any number of competitor establishments in the area for the same price."}
{"text":"I visited this place with the family during happy hour. We had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. This was understandable as the place was packed. I sat at the bar to catch a few minutes of whatever game was playing and enjoyed a beer until we were seated. The bartender's service, I noticed just in those few minutes,  was top notch. Once seated we were served by a nice waitress. Really the best service I've had in quite some time. A guy in a shirt/tie came by a few times to check on things. This was not to the annoying point, but it was just right. The waitress also came back quite often to check on things. I never had to ask for a refill The food, while not great, was not bad. I mean it is what it is with this type of place. I'm not going to brag to my friends about the food, but I will recommend based on the service alone."}
{"text":"It was a alright dinner experience. I ordered a Caesar salad, taste like lettuce that was just washed with cheese and croutons, wasn't even the right lettuce for a Caesar salad and there was no dressing on it.  Also ordered the 6oz sirloin, mashed tatters and broccoli. It was all just super plain. Took the waiter 15 minutes to bring me more dressing for my salad. boxed up the rest of my food to take home and left. It wasn't the greatest experience. Applebee's has gone down hill quite a bit in the last 10 years."}
{"text":"I ordered online while at work to have a meal for two ready to go when I got off.  I pulled into one of the curbside to go spots.  I sat there for a good 5 minutes before someone came to my window.  They read me my order and I paid.  I waited for another 10 minutes before I got my food.  I find this to be uncalled for as I ordered with plenty of time to make the food and I had a set time for pick up and this is now at least 15 minutes passed.  I finally got handed my food and headed home.  Once home we began to pull the food out and realized that there were things missing or incorrect.  The sauce for the mozzarella sticks was missing and the sides to one of the meals were incorrect.  Having gone over the order in the parking lot with the waitress I guess I expected what was discussed to be in the bag.  This made what was going to be a nice relaxing meal very upsetting.  I hope that your employees (ALL employees involved in the meal and transactions) begin to pay closer attention to the orders instead of making them up themselves."}
{"text":"Let me first say that this is a review of this restaurant in particular, on this specific evening, not overall of Applebee's.   We come to this Applebee's several times a month, whether it be for late night happy hour or for Kid's Eat Free on Tuesdays. Mostly on Kids eat free Tuesdays. I'm a single mom and on a budget, so we go a couple of Tuesdays a month and I will get a half price appetizer and a drink and my son will eat for free a $3.99 kids meal. It's a great deal when both of us eat for $10 including tip. Not tonight, though. Although I've never had an issue before, my bill came back and I made the server aware that my son's meal was not taken off. He said he'd speak with his Manager. The manager, Jamie, came over and was confrontational from the start. She stated that this is a business and that I can't have my son's meal for free because that just doesn't make sense because his meal is the same price as mine. She said that it was free with an Entree and that the sign out side said so and that I could go check. I let her know that I wasn't aware that the policy had changed since the last time we'd been and that I had to order an entree (which I've never had to do in the past).   She continued to say that I'm lying that I've been before on Tuesdays because she does inventory and she's here every Tuesday. She continued on in front of other patrons stating that this is a business that needs to make money. I paid, left embarrassed and will probably never return to this Applebee's again, if any. Our server was a doll, the food was just ok as usual, but the nightmare of this manager was enough to say no thank you to ever returning.   As I was leaving, I checked the sign outside, and of course there is no mention of \"free with purchase of Entree\" anywhere on the building. Sooo I took a picture to post of that sign too."}
{"text":"We went to Applebee's for dinner. Placed our order. Had a nice time until the food arrived. The Manager helped our waitress deliver our food, he reached across the table past two glasses of lemonade and yes you guessed it both glasses were knocked over spilling all over my husband. No apology no nothing except of course the bill without even a dime taken off. We will never again enter this establishment and I suggest if you do bring a change of clothing."}
{"text":"I recently had a bad experience here.  One of the servers had an attitude problem, and she was very unprofessional and unattentive.  Which is a shame, because I had been a customer there for years, and I loved going there to be served by the likes of Ian (great server).  I'll lay low for a while."}
{"text":"Applebee's USED to be excellent about a decade or more ago!  Case in point: they used to have this delicious orange glazed salmon dish that they got rid of for some mediocre tasting,  god forsaken artichoke salmon!  The portions have considerably shrunk as well.  Come on guys-  give us a piece of salmon larger than a pack of cigarettes for chrissakes!  Your adult salmon portion feels like a kid's meal!  What really ticks me off is that some of the servers never ask if my child needs a refill of soda-  they just automatically bring it to the table.  They should ASK the parents first, since many parents are trying to cut down on the amount of sugar their children imbibe!   Many savvy  parents will limit their children's soda intake (and other foods and snacks), so their children don't grow up to have the hind quarters of Kim Kardashian or Rosie O'Donnell!  Lastly, everything is overpriced.  I can get much larger portions of food, that taste better, at a diner or family restaurant!  Why we still go here on occasion, I wish I knew.  I was going to give a 2 star rating, but the 'shooters' and 'pretzel bites' desserts are delish!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for lunch and just a friendly atmosphere. Very consistent food. Always good."}
{"text":"Worst experience.  Ordered 2 for $20 meal.  Boneless wings appetizer were all bread dipped in bbq sauce, too much sauce and you can't see if there's any chicken.  Ribs was dry and tough.  Cedar grilled lemon chicken was over salty and too sour.  No apology from the lousy server.  She didn't offer any refills.  She said she's fixing the others order.  After waiting for a while.  She gave us our check and said the other food we ordered is not coming.  What a waste!  No match for the nearby Panda Express."}
{"text":"I usually check Yelp for any new place I go to, especially if I'm out of town, but we were headed to another restaurant that just so happened to close early that day. I fell asleep in the car and woke up at Applebees. Now that I go back to read the reviews I wish I would have had the time to check out the reviews ahead of time because it seems as though there are alot of stories similar to mine, with a lot of unhappy customers. I don't know if they need to change management or the servers, but something has got to change."}
{"text":"I never used to care for Applebee's. In Ohio, we have a similar chain called O'Charleys. They have about the same food but they also have AMAZING Rolls. I have finally come to terms with the fact that Applebee's isn't going to add similar rolls to their tables and I have actually started dining here.   I have been to this particular Applebees probably 20 times within the last few years. I have recently started coming after 9pm for their reverse happy hour and on Sundays for their football happy hour.   The Staff: I normally sit at the bar so I can watch the games. The staff is always willing to chat and they are very friendly.   The Weight Watchers Meals: Occasionally, I watch what I eat. I have found their nutrition menu very easy to read.   The Food quality: Surprisingly consistent and good.   The Prices: I rarely leave with a tab larger than $20 for two people  The Drinks: Decent Margaritas and liquor variety."}
{"text":"I flew in on a late-evening flight and I was STARVING! Apparently there are not many late-night food options in this city, so I was pleased to find an Applebees on my Google maps because I know they are always open until mid-night.   I sat at the bar and I was served by a male bartender. I think his name was Mike. He was very chatty and friendly. I ordered some items not on the happy hour menu and he informed me of similar options that were on the happy hour menu. I ended up going with my original choice despite the price difference, but it was nice to know my options.   My Patron margarita was very good & my Chicken Ques was awesome as usual. I would go back."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick lunch after a Wal-Mart trip. My server was awesome. They now have apps & desserts you can order with an ipad on the table which I thought was awesome. I enjoyed my food/service. I loved the broccoli soup."}
{"text":"This is my Go-To Applebee's. I personally am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, especially in Las Vegas where we have so much variety. Although, they do have a health conscious menu with a detailed list of the calories so the menu works for me. I normally get the Napa chicken or a Salad.   We sit at the bar normally and the same two male bartenders always seem to be working. Both are very prompt and give great lunch service."}
{"text":"Ordered the peppered sirloin of their \"pub diet\" menu. Medium rare, they even sliced it in the kitchen. It came out med. Well. The manger Megan I believe, said the waitress didn't specify, so that's the way it comes, we will make a new one. Next one came out raw, gray like, again already sliced. Why in heck would you bring it out? They took it off the bill. BIG FREAKING DEAL! An hour and a half later I got my bill $46.85 .....four soups, TINY PORTIONS and one lunch. 2 drinks. I would rather have ripped up fifty bucks and tossed it out my sunroof. I would have had more pleasure! I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO ANY APPLEBEES AGAIN. Don't bother contacting me with a please come back on us, the answer is Hell NO!"}
{"text":"Sat for over 30 minutes hoping to place our order.  Couldn't get service.  Bartender sees whats going on and says nothing.  Watches us walk out without an apology.  Door girl is oblivious and thanks us for coming in.  Forget this place."}
{"text":"It looks like this location does not have great reviews. My husband and I? have been there three or four times in the last couple of months and we have had good experiences every time. The food is about what you would expect from a chain like this. The prices are good and we have always been blessed with good service. We often find ourselves needing late night food that is close to the west side, I have been happy to discover this as an option. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, I stood for a few minutes and noticed 2 older women preparing to exit, there were 2 employees standing by the door, neither one opened the door for these women, I actually held both the interior and exterior doors for them, very loudly they thanked me and referred to me jokingly as \"The Doorman\" An older gentleman stated that this act of kindness was wonderful and while looking at the two employees, I responded \"I was simply raised correctly\" The host asked me how many were in my party while the server went to start opening the door for guests.  I responded that I had 2 people and the other one should arrive within a couple minutes.  The host then grabbed 2 menus and told me to follow him.  I started to walk with him, he stops puts the menus back into the host stand and then informs me it will be a few minutes.  Looking around, I did notice more than 8 tables that were empty/dirty so for me to be told to follow him and then be told basically \"nevermind\" was a little confusing.  My server Karen took 12 minutes to deliver my iced tea and my sister's water. Karen came up to our table and asked for our order but before we could answer her, she actually WALKED AWAY from us, to take someone else's order!  After she took their order she came back to finally ask us what we wanted, but then said \"hold on\" and began talking to another server behind our table and started to clean the table with her.  Finally when that table was almost cleared she came up to us and never once apologized, simply asking what we would like?   I calmly with a smile, asked for \"another server please\" She looked at me confused and walked back to the table behind us and finished clearing it with the other server and you could tell she was talking very inappropriate about us.  She walked away a few minutes later, was gone for a few, came back to the table and asked \"Do you know who you would like to serve you\" Karen was really trying my patience at this point, with the same calm smile I simply stated \"someone better than her\" She sent Mike R over, who I stupidly assumed was a manager, he was not, when I explained what had just happened while he was bent down elbows on the table like he was a friend joining us for dinner WHICH for the record I think is so annoying, he simply stated as he threw his hands up \"How are you doing tonight, How are you doing tonight\"  I quickly realized he was not a manager, because I know for a fact that is not how a manager would have handled the situation.  We gave him our order, which was the 2 for $24 and ordered the Spinach Dip for starters.  My steak I asked for medium rare and my sister ordered the Nawlins Skillet.   He was trying to get us to smile, but the annoying thing that I do not like is how he kept referring to me as \"Boss\" My name is not \"Boss\" do not refer to me as that!  While we waited for our appetizer I noticed that Karen was not doing too well with her other 3 tables, she actually picked her rear end 3 times while she was talking to the couple across from us, witnessed by more than just myself and my sister!  We referred to her as Typhoid Karen for the rest of the evening.  I over heard her telling someone that you did not have enough dishes so \"of course people will just have to understand that\" referring to the fact that another group of people had to wait for their food to be delivered...if this were the case, COME ON buy some more dishes, or better yet, hire some faster kitchen staff!!  I do not think guests should ever be told that you do not have enough plates to go around so we should just expect to wait.  Our appetizer was delivered, long after I felt it should have been and basically was plopped onto our table, the girl delivering it I only saw once and she never responded when my sister and I both thanked her.  With the exception of being called \"Boss\" repeatedly and the kneeling down to our table, Mike R was not that bad, he kept apologizing for everything taking so long.  We were there for well over an hour, which I felt, was way too long.  It did not take us long to eat our meals.  Everything was the wait for our food and our drinks.  Never once did a manager approach our table, I might be mistaken, but from what I recall, whenever there is an issue like that, a server should advise the manager to visit the table.  I never once witnessed a manager at all.  I understand that this is just Applebee's, but seriously it is not like we were ordering off the $1.00 menu at McDonalds, I would expect better service here.  I would also expect a server to refrain from digging in her rear (yes it was on the outside of the pants, but still!!) until she is in the bathroom or away from the dining patrons.  My sister also informed me that when the server swung the door open to allow her to enter he did so in a matter that it almost hit her in the face because of the force of which he threw the door open.  She had to take a step back as the door almost greeted her face."}
{"text":"Horrible. My coworkers and I stopped by here after work to enjoy some lunch on Thursday around 2:30. I got a Cesar salad and spinach and artichoke penne pasta. Didn't taste good at all, very bland. I get home and take a nap from being full, and wake up a few hours later nauseous as crap. I started vomiting every 20 minutes for like 2 hours. then it went down to every hour. Ended up going to the hospital for the food poisoning they gave me. Even my other coworkers who went with me got sick, one who went to the hospital as well. And we all got different food."}
{"text":"I love applebees they have the bedt 3cheese penne on the 2for 20. I had a great time with my daughter there waitress kept my drinks full not once did I have to ask for a refill. I wish I remembered the waitresses name cuz she was really on top of her game."}
{"text":"Was grocery shopping for dinner and somehow ended up here instead... Our host was very nice and sat us immediately after walking in, he also informed us on drink specials. It is a bit loud here but not as loud as the camelback/central location :)  I was thinking of ordering a drink but opted for water instead just because. We decided on the 2-4-24 and chose boneless wings as our appetizer. I think Applebee's wing's are just OK compared to other places, the sauce just doesn't do it for me but I'll eat them  For my entree I decided on the double crunch shrimp with fries  Wow, they give you at least 18 pieces of shrimp and I am like trying to eat... Unless they're trying to say something haha  I'm taking some home The shrimp is good itself with the sauce on the side"}
{"text":"$30 for 2 entrees + appetizer, 2 x $3.49 for drinks, and 2 x $7.99 for chicken finger meals for kids. Total before tip was about $58, for 2 adults and 2 kids.  The mozzarella sticks were good. The chicken and shrimp entree was okay, but the portion was somewhat disappointing. The steak fettuccine went through a flavour vacuum before it hit the table; possibly the most boring pasta dish I've ever had. The kids seemed to enjoy the chicken fingers well enough. The frozen strawberry lemonade was disgustingly sweet. The raspberry iced tea was fine.  2 stars might seem harsh, but $70 for a disappointing meal (with tip) really sucks. Talk about buyer's remorse. One positive thing I can say is that staff were very nice, but service alone won't bring me back. My first and last visit to an Applebee's."}
{"text":"This is good if you like frozen foods.... Everything they make here tastes like its straight out of the freezer. The Bar has fruit flies constantly swarming it and their pop is flat. The only reason people still go here is because its the only restaurant in Brunswick.    Please get rid of this and bring real restaurants to Brunswick."}
{"text":"Where to begin...I am first courteously seated by the host (props to the host). Once seated, we then wait for our waiter to arrive. Not knowing who it is yet a person walks by and says, \"whatcha you want to drink?\". Um...yeah hi, how are you or how about a hey I'm going to be your waiter. Anyways... just thought he was super busy which is ok. Once he's back with our drinks he takes our orders. We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order. Our meals arrive, mine looked fine but hers had two orders of mashed potatoes,  mushrooms and onions. Looked strange at first but whatever we went with it, we were hungry.   Here is where it gets interesting. As my girlfriend was eating her mashed potatoes she feels a chewy piece in her mouth. She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point. So, to not make scene we just inform our waiter about the piece of paper and advice him to let the cooks know to be more careful. He grabs our plates, grins and doesn't say a word....ok. He then comes back and sets the check on the table and again walks away. It gets worse, we notice all of substitutes were charged as well. Did he not understand what a substitute is? We ate it so whatever, we were over it and just wanted to leave. I would rate the food a 5 star for taste minus the paper in my food but 0 stars for service.   Hint to the waiter:  Next time attempt to act like you care. A simple, Im sorry let me see what I can do, goes a long way. I wasn't expecting a free meal but it would have been nice to least offer another side to make up for the contaminated mashed  potatoes. Also, we were really nice about he whole thing, next time you may not get people like us."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting an elderly family member who wanted to go to Applebee's so that's where we took her. I wasn't excited about going to Applebee's but wasn't going to deprive Grandma of her favorite restaurant. Furthermore, this is Elyria and our choices are limited.  I was very pleased with the food quality and staff attentiveness. The restaurant appears to have been refreshed in last few years. The hostess was patient with us and gave us a large table that accommodated our wheelchair rolling right up to it. Nice!   Food quality was 3.5 to 4.0 stars: good ribs, burgers, and 6oz steak. Tortilla chips were somewhat greasy and fries portion on small side. Cook time was so-so but the superior service and happy grandma makes five stars! Thank you Applebee's for providing a fun family dinner."}
{"text":"I cannot believe what just happened. My fianc√©e and I came in at 6:30 on a Sunday night, the parking lot mostly empty. We walk in, and after a few minutes standing there, the hostess comes up to us and says there will be a THIRTY MINUTE WAIT because they only had one server and one cook. Mind you, the place was only 1/4 full if that! How is that even remotely possible at any professional dining establishment?! Never ever again, and I will be letting corporate know. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Love the Tequila Lime Chicken here.  Going to try something different this time. Chicken Wonton Tacos and Steak Quesadilla!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Should not take over an hour to make 2 orders of burgers and fries on a slow night. And then receive the check after 2 minutes of eating. Half of the restaurant was empty. Some guests waited along time to be seated in an overly staffed evening. Many guests around us had issues as well."}
{"text":"I told everyone that I wasn't feeling this. Should have listened to my gut on this one. We didn't make reservations for our party of 7, which I suppose we should have. They had to create space for us. Like really create it. Where we were all sitting in the walkway. Knew I was in the walkway when the waiter asked for us to move so that a little girl in a wheelchair could get around. But I didn't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building. And while you're eating too...it's so disgusting. The place is so freakin crowded as well...maybe just because I hate being in crowded and tight spots.  As far as the menu, I wasn't impressed. It took me 20 mins to find something (partly because I'm picky). But I ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo, nothing to rave about. I wanted more broccoli than what was provided, but oh well. The lime/kiwi lemonade was pretty good though."}
{"text":"The server never greeted us after she seen us, so we decided to leave, poor customer service. I'm disappointed the best apples-bee is in mentor Ohio."}
{"text":"I have a long time relationship with Applebee's . Our waiter Christian was very pleasant and our food was hot and delicious. This is one of the best Applebee's in northern Ohio. I'm always satisfied when I come to this one. Please keep up the great customer service. Great food for a great value."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for a birthday dinner for my son.  We had a nice time, it was very relaxing.  The wait was short, just 15 minutes, although it looked like it was much more busy based on the full parking lot.  The beer selection is poor but I was able to settle on a Goose IPA. The waitress didn't know anything about the beers explaining that she's a vodka girl. I actually would up having two as did my wife so we were off to a good start.  For dinner I had a  steak selection that stated to have just over 300 calories.  It tasted good and I definitely do not feel like I over ate.  (I spent my calorie savings on the beer.) They have a number of menu items with calorie and protein content printed in the menu which I really like. The other items with no calorie information you can probably safely assume are at least 1000 calories.     My son didn't have the same type of fun as his parents since his beer was rootbeer, but as a consolation he was serenaded by a half dozen waitresses closer to his age than mine and given a free sundae."}
{"text":"If zero stars was an options, that's what I would give. Terrible service and an awful server who argued with me that was salad was sitting in a plate of water. Supposedly it was a sauce, but even if that was true, it was a gross sauce and I asked for all dressing on the side because who really likes wilted lettuce on the bottom? gross.  Bad food I can handle, but bad service only makes things worse.  We wont be back."}
{"text":"Well I was Greet by Daisy when Entering the restaurant Marcus the bartender was amazing provide Great service very friendly staff Guillermo was amazing he Did A great Job with his Service Just need Knowledge of product but Made a Great effort to Help"}
{"text":"I was Not acknowledge upon entering the establishment I place a order and waited a Good minute Kelvin if that his name that work there has a Nasty attitude warning his Customer service suck and some rude staff as well will not be returning"}
{"text":"I walked in and the first thing I noticed was the floor was dirty. The carpet  and the steps very dirty. Then the server walks up and in a very loud voice before she got to my table she says \" What can I get you.\" She saw I didn't like that so she asked me what I would like to drink. I told her tea. When she left I decided I was not going to eat in a dirty place with a rude server so I left."}
{"text":"It was good and yet, it was Applebee's, they had a computer at the table and so it was something new to see, as I hadn't been at Applebee's for sometime; with a fresh look and a bit of new mordern means kind of makes it a place to go and see.  The food was good and the over all look and feel of the place was a nice change.  A nice place to go out and treat yourself and someone1 that you like to spend time with."}
{"text":"Disgraceful. An elderly man with an obvious disability stumbled and knocked the hostess stand, hurting himself in the process. The hostess laughed and later gossiped with Co-workers, while pointing to him in front of ourselves and other customers. We asked a waiter for her name. \"Kitana\", you should never work in public services again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and cozy overall atmosphere.  Food was good, although not spectacular, it's reasonably priced.  Will surely return."}
{"text":"We got to Applebee's at 9:35. It took the server ten minutes to get to our table. She only had three tables in her section. We ordered drinks and food at the same time since it took so long for her to come to us. After waiting 15 minutes for the drinks my friend went to the bar to get them because we were very thirsty. The serve came back to the table with one of our drinks and said, \"oh wow okay.\" She slammed the drink down at the table across from us. I'm guessing she was upset we went and got them. Her hormonal childish response really set the tone for the remainder of the visit. She then began gossiping at the bar with the the bar tender and they were giving us dirty looks. The manager, and I'm sincerely hoping she's only a shift supervisor and not a general manager, went over to them and was talking. After a couple minutes she came over to us and said she would pay for the drinks because we waited so long. We told her that was not necessary and we would just like to pay for food and service and be on our way. She became rude and confrontational and asked us very impolitely what we need then, because she would be taking over our table. I told her that her waitresses were making it very apparent to make us feel unwelcomed and we would be leaving.  The \"manager's name was Margee Baker and the server was Tera. If this is who you employ to represent your brand at your restaurants and the way you choose to conduct business we have no interest in ever visiting an Applebee's again. Also, the server's shirt was completely filthy. I understand they serve food but It looked like she rolled around in spaghetti sauce. I'm astounded with the lack of service."}
{"text":"The reviews are true. The service is fantastic.  But i ordered the shrimp and broccoli cavatappi. After a 34 minute wait my pasta was yellow, and cold. I had to send it back. When it came back out 3 minutes later it was apparently popped into a microwave and re-served. Broccoli smushy and overcooked,  the shrimp was lacking any juice from being nuked, and I'm just over it. 15$ on a meal I could have made myself at home way better than this..          I had thee Bahama mama rum mixed drink with my meal. It sat on the bar for 5 mins and got watered down to the point I should have just ordered a lemonade!  Where is the alcohol?     I will not be back"}
{"text":"Service is very VERY slow. It took 20 min for us to even order our food. The restaurant was empty at 1:30 in the afternoon, so it was not due to an overwhelming amount of customers. Will probably think twice before coming here. Make sure you have time to spare."}
{"text":"Something is happening at Applebee's.  It's gone from somewhere that didn't stand out to a place I've eaten at three times in three weeks.  I picked a different menu item each time.  The steak quality is totally unexpected.  The plate sizes are big enough but not too big.  The prices are great.  Plus they stay open late."}
{"text":"The food and service is good.  The temperature in the place was 68¬∞. I saw other people going back out getting jackets.  One woman came back with a bla nket"}
{"text":"I ordered a Philly cheese steak and the red peppers, green peppers, and onions were raw. I really don't think they were suppose to be. Other than that every thing was good."}
{"text":"Even during the busiest dinner rush, they have one waitress per 6 tables who is very rarely around.  We ordered drinks from the bus boy and apps from the table tablet before the waitress ever said anything to us. My s.o. asked for water three times and still did not get a refill. Just, really slow, inattentive, service with mediocre food."}
{"text":"Ordered the 8.99 lunch special tomato soup and blt. What a mess when it arrived, made using 1 slice of stale bread cut uneven to somewhat resemble a 1/2 sandwich. Bread was crushed with no mayo, 2skimpy slices of bacon 1/2 thin slice of tomato and a shed of lettuce. Horrible execution by the cook and never saw our server again to get mayo or refills of drinks. This location has ruined me at going to Applebee's ever again. See picture of ptesentation."}
{"text":"Just got home from having dinner here. I was so very disappointed.  Does anyone even go to this restaurant anymore? I had not been to Applebees before & thought we will try it out as I had a Gift Card. There were so many booths & tables open & the person who seats the guests is looking around for a table while stand there. Before we could even read the menu, the server is at our table to take our order. Either they want to get it over & done with, or they do not show up at all. I ordered a Margarita & specifically said not too much ice. I get my drink & the glass is half full of ice. I just let it go, as I did not want to say anything. I  ordered the artichoke & spinach cavaratti as my main meal. I am not even going to say it tasted bad, as there was no taste at all. I don't know what it should even taste like. It was with a basic white sauce & no seasoning at all. Tasted bland. I had to say something at this point as I was hungry & when food does not taste good, I get very upset. There was not eve. 1 piece of Artichoke to be found. I mentioned this to the server & he said there should be Artichoke in it. I moved my food around& showed him there was nothing.  If they did flavor it with some sort of Artichoke flavor, I am sorry, I did not taste it. He then asked if I wanted to speak to a Manager. What was the point? Did the Manager have the artichoke the chef forgot to add? This is my first time there & it will be my last for sure. Very disappointed & unhappy."}
{"text":"My mother sent me a gift card to use for my birthday (today-April 23).  Since I wasn't going to have enough to tip, I ordered carside to go eat with my Pay-Per-View movie.  My order didn't go through online.  As I sat in the designated parking spot, Christina came out to check on me just as I was calling to see if my order went through.  It didn't, but I downloaded the app and had the order set up. She was very helpful and sweet.  Not only that, I received my order quickly!  The meal tasted great, too.  I was worried getting my order to go, but I won't be in the future from this location(699  Stephanie Street)."}
{"text":"First time I came here I had the quesadilla burger thought it was good...second time I felt like I had eaten something that was goona burst through my chest...service is slow ..its average at best.....fine for belly fillings...bring maalox :)"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting! The server took about 10 minutes just to come greet us and she wasn't even busy. We weren't notified of any specials whatsoever even though it was Happy Hour. We placed our order and 3 minutes later we decided we wanted to change something to the order and the server told us the order was already almost done? Please tell me how my order was almost done considering I order the Chicken Penne. No matter what chicken and pasta takes about 10 minutes to be well prepared. And when the food came out it was disgusting. The pasta was chewy and hard and the chicken was pink and not throughly cooked. Which is why it only took 5 minutes to make. My boyfriend and I will never be back to this location ever again"}
{"text":"We waited so long for our appetizer, the people next to us, who came in after us, were eatting their meal. 3 people stopped by our table to ask if our app came out yet. Our food was good but had to wait 4 minutes for silverware after we got food. We had to get up and get our own napkins off of another table. No drink refills. When we were done eatting we waited so long for our check and boxes I called the store (yes, on my phone from a table) to tell them our table was still waiting for the check. I have never been to this Applebee's and you better believe I will Never be back.... way too many restaurants in the area to deal with mediocre food and horrible service."}
{"text":"Went yesterday 10/21 with my family of seven and was expecting for there to be a wait time since we went on a Saturday and we were fine with that. The problem came when after 20 minutes or so another party of 6 comes in and they start complaining of wanting to be seated. The two greeters AND the manager  told them that my party was ahead of them and they would seat them in 20 minutes tops. After the other party kept complaining they got seated before my party. I then ask to speak to the same manager and ask him why this happened and I get told that he doesn't have an answer to that. By the time we got seated we had waited for over 40 minutes after the party that came after us got seated. Just a word of advice if you do decide to go here you should complain you will be seated a whole lot faster then if you are not a complainer like i was."}
{"text":"I don't know where the negative reviews are coming from, but our server and food were terrific!  First, a big shout out to JOSH, our server, who was AMAZING! He even explained, in detail, the menu and specials. When we were ready to order, he pointed out that our order was part of the 2 for 22.50 WITH an appetizer! Had we ordered the way we were going to, it would have been more expensive,  and NO appetizer! He also came by a few times to check on us, and our food, and we never felt rushed. We had the spinach, artichoke and cheese dip, warm and gooey goodness. I had the sirloin steak with garlic green beans and baked potato. My husband had the spinach, artichoke and grilled chicken Cavatappi. My steak was a perfect medium rare. I had the frozen strawberry lemonade and he had the watermelon sangria. They were both tasty! All of that and our tab, with drinks, was $37. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad for what it is. My service was quick and food was good. I tried some kind of smores churros which I definitely wouldn't order those again, but besides that everything else was good my service was good, the food was hot and the beer was cold which is what wanted when I came in."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Applebee's doesn't disappoint. We went on Veterans Day and my AF hubby was able to get a free meal of his choice from a special menu. This location (not sure if all of them did) also had a POW/MIA Table set for those that couldn't be with us to celebrate the day. That was an awesome gesture that I know all active and retired service members appreciated. He had the Three Cheese Chicken Cavatappi. Nice sized bowl, perfect pieces of grilled chicken breast covered in a creamy 3 cheese sauce.  Pasta al dente, cooked perfectly. I went with the Mac and Cheese and Honey Pepper Chicken. Pasta cooked well, cheese sauce tasted a bit artificial but not so much I wouldn't eat it again. The bacon was basically non existent, although the description said it was in there!  Chicken was in the form of tenders, 3 to be exact, and covered in a peppery but sweet sauce. It was definitely a large enough serving for both a man or a woman. I ended up bringing half of it home, which was probably a good thing considering it is a nearly 1500 calorie dish! Service was friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place will be closed soon. I like Applebees but this location is getting really bad every single day."}
{"text":"My streak of good reviews has come to an end.  Now if we can just do the same to Justin Beiber's life expectancy. I guess it was my fault for choosing to eat at a chain restaurant after lunch rush when the servers were trying to get their side work done and get out.   Not even going to go into the details of what we ordered otherwise than to say it was incorrect, disappointing, took an excessive amount of time to prepare, and overall was a waste of time and money. I'm so frustrated with the restaurant and service industry. I hear often servers and other related staff complain about bad tippers. \"If you can't afford to tip, don't go out to eat.\" How many times have you heard someone say that?  I have a better saying. If you aren't good at your job. Go find another one and save the rest of the world from having to deal with your horrible work ethic combined with the American sense of entitlement. Just because you work in a profession that involves tips doesn't mean you earned any."}
{"text":"The service started out good. Then, as the restaurant grew more crowded, our waitress became less and less present. Took 45 minutes to get our food, and much of it was cold! Further, we were a party of 4, and the orders came out piecemeal!!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible and the food is mediocre.  I had to ask the girl who sat us for 2 high chairs, for my 2(clearly to little for regular chairs) kids twice, and she still only ended up bringing one. I held my daughter until the server brought a second high chair.  At these types of placed I usually go for a burger or a sandwich, this time I ordered a steak, which was a mistake. It was cooked to the correct pinkness yet somehow very very dry.  With all the other option in this area I think I will be choosing something else from now on."}
{"text":"Terrible experience and unfortunately not the first. I hadn't eaten at an Applebee's in years as I got sick of the prices going up and quality going down. Decided to give it another go with my brother. Got an order of hot wings. Service was very slow, but I get it, things get busy. Asked for extra bleu cheese. Got ranch. Told the server it was ranch, he took it back and brought out another cup of ranch. Grabbed him and told him again and he told me that he poured it from the container marked bleu cheese. Tasted it again to make sure and it was definitely ranch. Took that one away and came back about 4 min later with a thing of bleu cheese finally. Unfortunately by this point the wings, which I can describe as mediocre at best (not even close to hot), were cold and soggy.  On top of everything, we were playing with the small tablet style computer on the table and checking out everything it did since I have kids and thought it was a good idea. I checked every app I went into to make sure there were no charges attached. At the end of the meal, we got our bill and there were charges for two camera things we did with the tablet. I again checked and no where on the app did it say there would be any charges. We told the waiter and he just took them off the bill, which was good, but he did it very quickly without ever even verifying, which made us feel like he gets this question or issue all the time and automatically just removes it. If we didn't really look at the bill, we would have never noticed. And I'm sure some have been charged and not noticed.  Overall, Applebee's in general has just gone so far down hill I can barely recognize it as the restaurant I used to love. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location with seven of my coworkers. We were in a rush with limited time to eat and return to work. Our server, Maria M, was amazing as well as the rest of the staff that assisted. We ate, paid, and made it back in time with four minutes to spare. Thank you, Maria, for helping us have a nice lunch and not risk being late. The food was good too. I had the Caprese Mozzarella Chicken and ate every bite!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this Applebee's before, and I think it's one of the sadder locations.  It was super busy when we got here tonight, and we were seated in a booth near the back.  I went with the triple sampler which came with two sliders, spinach dip and buffalo wings.  The spinach dip was almost electric green a really bright color.  The rest of the food was fine, but the whole meal was weird.  For starters, I had to ask repeatedly to get my sprite with dinner.  The server kept forgetting to bring it, and I was wondering when it was going to come out.  Also, My water kept running out and I started getting irritated since I was super thirsty today. It's not that I need the server to stand at my table with a vat of water, but I literally would have to flag someone down to come over after it had been empty for some time.  We also found a bug on the table during dinner, and I have no idea where that came from.  Service was good, but it was not the greatest experience I've had.  Not my favorite Applebee's at all."}
{"text":"Decent location for this chain, you usually know what you are getting and what to expect from the staff. If you enjoy the chain this is a safe one to go to.  If you frequent the chain you know what you like and I can tell you that most of the stuff at this location is on par with what you expect."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place the aroma from the carpet hits you in the nostrils. This place smells really bad and the servers can barely speak English and they suck. This place is a disgrace. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Applebee's.  If I return, I will not order what I did this time.  I was surprised to find the restaurant full and loud at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon with parties waiting for seating.  My companion and I were placed at a small table for two.  It took several minutes for a server to approach and this took place only after one of the servers noticed that our party had not been greeted and came over to take our beverage order.  We did not receive silverware or napkins until after we asked and after we had eaten our appetizers.  The $8.29 charge for five cheese sticks is excessive. The $12.99 all you care to eat chicken tenders and ribs feature, which was not promoted at the restaurant, was a disappointment.  The chicken was dry, the ribs were drowned in sauce and had very little meat on them.  The meats and the french fries were too salty.  What saved the meal was the extraordinarily attentive service from Jacqueline, particularly impressive given how busy the restaurant was."}
{"text":"Horrible....just horrible!  Three of us were sat in the bar at 7:45pm.  The music from the juke box was very loud. During our dinner we asked three times if the music could be turned down a bit.  We realize it's the bar, but we were yelling at each other across the table due to the music volume!  Our waitress took our drink order, delivered outlet drinks quickly, took our food order, then never came back to our table.  An appetizer was delivered quickly by another server, then shortly two of our entrees were delivered by yet another server.  The third entree wasn't delivered and out waitress was no where to be found.  After another 10 or so minutes, I flagged a bartender down and asked to have the last meal checked on.  Finally our server showed at our table and explained that another server had taken the entree to another table.  She apologized and took another 8 to 10 minutes to bring out the meal.  Meanwhile the two of us were done eating.  You, as well as us were wondering why we were never checked on after the first meals were delivered.  None of us will return to this location."}
{"text":"let me start off by saying that the service received from Quinton at this applebee's has made me a fan. so although the food IMO gets 3 stars.. the service is what will get me to come back.   had the 2 for 20 deal which is totally a steal. we had the spinach dip which was extremely fresh and hot and delicious. the chips were thin and crispy and went well with the salsa that also comes with this appetizer.   i ordered the provolone stuffed meatballs with fettuccine while my DC had the citrus lime chicken. i think that's the name of it. anyway.. my meatballs were really good but the fettuccine that came with was not so yummy. it was overcooked and sad. the white sauce was bland but was better after mixing it with the red sauce from the meatballs. the breadstick it came with was sad and undercooked. it was like those frozen ones you microwave..   the chicken entree was definitely much better. the chicken was super juicy and the rice it came with was good too. i was immediately jealous when i took a bite of this dish.   got the maple butter blondie for dessert because my DC had been craving it for MONTHS. i prefer chocolate desserts.. especially ones with melty insides lol. so this was not a winner in my book. but it's just preference.   anyway.. Quinton was extremely funny and friendly. like the kind of funny and friendly that makes your day. he was knowledgeable and professional as well. we definitely felt taken care of and i could tell he enjoys what he does."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for late-night nosh.  My friends ordered various appetizers and one had the strip steak.  The appetizers (green beans, wings, boneless wings, quesadilla, mozzarella sticks an various other fried things) were very good. The spin dip was cold.   The steak was disgusting;  the vegetables were salty and oily.  I ordered the chicken florentine to-go (I think that's what it was called) and my husband took one look at it and said he'd eat something else.  It was an oily mess.  The server was very cool but forgot my to-go order and although the place was rather empty, service was slow."}
{"text":"We came here with the lowest of expectations (mainly to get the three year-old something to eat) but were pleasantly surprised. We ordered iced tea, kid's chocolate milk, kid's chicken tenders with applesauce, a black and bleu burger and I ordered the pretzel appetizer with beer-cheese. The kid's meal was good; they were very good quality chicken tenders.  The black and bleu burger was huge, and my husband ate all of it, along with the fries, which were seasoned perfectly.  He commented that he was shocked it was such good quality.   The only odd thing were the pretzels.  They were deep-fried, which is odd; I had been under the impression they were baked like soft pretzels usually are.  Anyway, they were good, as was the cheese dip and honey mustard.  My husband ate half the order, as it was very large.   All in all, we were pleasantly surprised with the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another garbage experience! Got easily the WORST waitress ever (her name is either Fabi or Fabio? her name on the name tag said Fabi). It took her forever to get a simple ice water out. And even then, she managed to mess it up! How hard is it to remember no lemon?? She managed to be slow and incompetent the whole time we were there. My shake took forever and I was really thirsty. Food took forever and we were actually ready to leave when it finally arrived. Our waitress was so awful that another table was angry at her too and were pretty much telling her off. I salute that other table, because boy did I feel a type of way about her. While service may have been slow prior, we never got crappy waitresses that took forever with everything. A new low for this Applebee's. That waitress definitely needs to be fired if she isn't already."}
{"text":"Not a super huge fan of Applebee's...for personal reasons...but ever since my first check in at this establishment I've been hooked! We've all seen the commercials...they have those 2 for $20 and 2 for $25 deals. Pretty good deal but the only thing I like on the menu is the 4 cheese Mac & Cheese with Spicey Honey Chicken strips...or something like that...you'll know what I'm talking about if you look at my photos of this place lol! Delish! Happy hour is awesome half off some pretty decent appetizers and some drinks. I prefer coming here than PT's I'm not much of a drinker...I'm a foodie."}
{"text":"We were road tripping and hungry, and unfortunately decided to venture into this establishment. First of all, the floors were noticeably filthy. Food, trash, crayons...nasty. I guess they don't do any spot cleaning until the end of the night.  As for the food, I ordered the Thai shrimp salad. I wish I had snapped a pic of what came out. There were like 3 pieces of lettuce, a bunch of shredded carrots and cabbage and wontons on top. Not a single piece of edamame. I guess the upside is the shrimp were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This particular Applebee's is ran very poorly. The manager walks around on purpose with purpose because he knows his servers are not providing quality service.!"}
{"text":"I mean it's Applebees, nothing special. I was never a huge fan just because it is a chain and the food is mediocre.  The service was just ok, it took a while for someone to come and take our order. They were pretty attentive for the most part after that and they were friendly.   They do have good lunches specials though which is what I went for. You are able to get a salad and entree for a pretty good price. I enjoyed what I ordered but since most of the food arrives frozen and not fresh which is a downfall for me."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the later happy hour with a friend. I was excited to see the margarita with the corona on top was only 5 bucks!! The drink selection for HH was amazing. The food choices on the other hand weren't, there were only 4/5 items. Me and the bestie decided to try them all. The food was great minus the artichoke dip. Definitely pass on that one guys, it was a little watery and had no flavor to it. The salsa it came with was good though. I enjoyed the boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks. The wonton tacos were ok not the best. I really liked our server he was nice and attentive. I want to come back every Sunday lol."}
{"text":"We took our 5 kids (yes 5, crazy I know) to eat spur of the moment. When we arrived we were greeted by a nice hostess and an amazing ballon guy!  When we were seated The waitress informed us that kids eat for .99 on Tuesday and I thought I had heard her wrong. She said no that's correct. I up front apologized for anything bad our kids may do and Laura our AMAZING waitress smiled and said no worries everything will be fine and not to worry. Just as she said the night was worry free and Laura made us feel welcome like the balloon guy did. The attention we were given tonight reminds me the power of GREAT customer service with a smile and we WILL dine at this location again. I only hope that our monitory gifts showed them how much we appreciate them doing their jobs with a smile."}
{"text":"Nothing special service decent she was nice and helpful she got a good tip. Just the alcohol was so weak i got better buzz at circle k slurpee machine after four drinks nothing so just go for average food."}
{"text":"I appreciate some of the items on the new menu, but I do wish they were more balanced meals. Gone of the days of the salad o start your meal and it seems that the majority of menu items are meat and starch. Where are the veggies?  The chicken & shrimp is tasty; with a few mushrooms and onions under the bird. The roasted potato side is cooked perfectly...some crispy edges and fluffy centers.  The brisket enchiladas are really good. The menu shows 3, but you will only get 2. Love the green chile sauce and the salsa has just a tinge of a kick. Too much for our 96yo grandma, but that is understandable.  Keep in mind that this is pub fare."}
{"text":"The 4 of us had a w onderful lunch there yesterday- we were greeted and served quickly and they were busy but server Caitlin took great care of us and the food was terrific. We were all pleased and the manager Frank was fantastic and greeted us. Thank you for a really nice lunch~We will all be back soon!"}
{"text":"ask for cassandra shes fun and nice and a great waitress....."}
{"text":"I just came back from visiting this location and I have to say the experience was just terrible. I've been to this location like three or four times but this time the experience was just awful. The waiter was not friendly, did not smile once, and she was not attentive whatsoever. I myself have worked in the restaurant industry and know how stressful and chaotic it can be but she did not even ask us if we were okay. We ordered the appetizer trio and our entrees after. It took 45 minutes for our food to get to the table, not once in that time did she ask if we were okay or that our food was almost out, no service whatsoever. We ended up gettiny our food, which was cold by the way, and never even got the appetizer we ordered. I was so upset with this visit, the manager was great and took care of the bill, I left hungry and upset. I'm not one of those people to take the time to write reviews everywhere I dine at, but this experience was just horrible."}
{"text":"Everything amazing! Our waitress Anna was beyond spectacular. The rest of the staff was just as great. Food was great! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here this evening. Very friendly staff.  The burgers were flavorful, but were VERY greasy."}
{"text":"For the amount they charge there now it's no longer worth going. The food is always adequate at best the portions have gotten stingier.   I guess only so much you can do with frozen food. come after 10 o'clock and this may be the most unprofessional staff I've ever seen I feel like I'm in a high school cafeteria the staff goofing around too much and it seems like they're more interested in hanging out with their buddies instead of waiting on tables.  The last time I was there I had to get my waiter from the table he was hanging out with sitting in the booth. will avoid going forward thankfully Burntwood tavern is opening up down the street and its just about the same price but way better"}
{"text":"Oh my delicious!  I have been waiting for this Applebee's to open for a couple months now, and I can say with confidence that it is delicious.    The atmosphere and interior is beautiful and very welcoming.  We were here for the grand opening, so the place was packed, but I don't expect anything less after having such a delicious meal.  We got the boneless wings appetizers and they were delicious; more than enough to share.  The meals were excellent too.  My dad's burger was pretty huge, and the toppings on the bourbon burger made it definitely something different and worth trying.  My mother's salad was something that any omnivore or carnivore would love.  Lots of greens, plus some fruits, nuts, and chicken to top it off.  My chicken portabella was also something rather delicious.  I am a huge onion fan, so I was in love with the major piling of chopped goodies.  Even if you are looking for a place just to grab some drinks, this could be a great find. All of us tried various items from the beverage menu: mixed drinks, specialties, and even wine.  Everyone was pleasantly satisfied.  They don't skimp on the alcohol either.  All in all, I would say I am very happy with our first experience, and my expectation of this place were completely fulfilled.  The only question is, when will I be going back, adn will I be able to not order the same thing??"}
{"text":"Best Applebee's experience ever. Sat at the bar, got happy hour beers, ordered my Marine his complimentary dinner. Nicole was amazing. Service was fast and the order was perfect. My steak was seasoned just right. My husband loved his burger. Great job, guys! Thanks."}
{"text":"went out saturday night about 9pm. there was a wait to be seated but not too bad. as soon as we sat down the waitress asked if we were ready to order so we said a couple beers and give us a minute. several minutes passed and we ordered an appetizer plus 2 entrees. about 20 minutes passed and everything was brought out together. strike one. the salmon was perfect but my husbands cajun shrimp fettucine was cold and congealed, the sides on the salmon dish were supposed to be herb roasted potatoes and a vegetable medley - i got a handful of raw spinach and a boiled red potato cut into quarters. strike 2. asked for the manager and sent back the food - minus the salmon. she offered a spinach salad instead. stressed that i was a vegetarian and i did not want anything like bacon crumbles and please a balsamic vinegarette on the side. she brought the salad with a BACON HONEY salad dressing on the side (wtf??) strike three. sent that back and asked for something else and the manager brought back THE EXACT SAME DRESSING I SENT BACK!!  the waitress brought the check saw that it only had a 20% disc and said she would take care of the whole thing. we paid for our beers and thanked her. the manager came over said she was on vacation so didnt know what was available and asked if we wanted dessert. i couldnt get out of there fast enough! as we were exciting the manager said \"i guess its just one of those days.  see you next time!\" i sincerely doubt it!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night for my moms birthday. Food was alright. We found not one, but two hairs on two different plates of food. Not 100% sure if the hair belonged to my sister or not, but just a precaution. Then, when it came time to do happy birthday song, they sent out a guy to sign it, since my mom is deaf. He did very well, but didn't seem too enthusiastic about it."}
{"text":"Proof to all my Yelp friends that I can write good reviews on chain restaurants. It's just a freaking Applebee's. The food is going to be overpriced for what you get...unless it's something from happy hour. If you can handle countless carbs from flavored syrups, the drink menu will treat you well. Order the \"grateful dead\". It's not on the menu and always gets the job done after the first three. There are a couple good brews, but beer is no longer discounted, so have fun paying $5 a pint.    I really only come here because they treat me nice, and I tip them well. Isn't that how the whole \"neighborhood\" feel is supposed to work?  PS-If you come here for the entrees, I will laugh at you."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight after driving by and seeing the packed parking lot. We hadn't eaten there for a long time and we were hungry so thought we'd try Applebee's again because, after all, all of those customers couldn't be wrong, right?    Right!  Food was great, a really good value, price, portions, etc. and atmosphere and service were exceptional too. We were very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Deals dealt 2/$20 &2/$25 with$1 margaritas! Score! Although they were ridiculously busy, the service was still good. You can tell they were short handed cause tables were left unclean with dishes piled, but that didn't bother us. They took a little while to get to us through the night, but it's not like they were just standing around, so we understood. Food was up to par  would def go back on a more mellow night."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience! This is my second time coming and the first time the food was cold and my drinks took forever. The first time I came I had a half raw chicken wing. Never coming again. I thought I would give it another try since I live down the street, but I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Our meal was perfect the service was great and the manager even came over to assist us to find a shopping location. My wife had the chicken oriental salad which is a favorite of hers.  And I had the salad with a turkey sandwich. We eat frequently at Applebee's and this particular Applebee's is the best we have had in several years"}
{"text":"We go to this Applebee's every couple of months and find it just fine!  Last week we went and had outstanding service.  Our server was Libby and the hostess was Le'Andra.  Le'Andra greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome.  Libby did everything perfectly.  It feels crazy to say it but with as often as we go out to eat, there's usually some sort of mess-up.  So, it was great also to see her do the same at each table with all of her other customers that we could see.       The food:  I don't hold it against Applebee's for taking away the Spinach and Shrimp with warm Bacon Vinaigrette Salad... I know, they took it away a couple years ago, but but but it was sooooooo goooood.  So I always look on the menu to see if they brought it back yet.  (not yet)      I like the Chicken Wonton Tacos and we shared the Spinach & Artichoke Dip( with tortilla chips).  All were good!  Usually we get the Brew Pub Pretzels and Beer Cheese Dip, LOVE LOVE IT, but we didn't order them this time.  My tablemates had the 2 for $20 Caprese Mozzarella Burgers and they loved them.        I don't know why this place isn't more popular, but it's always a solid 4 stars... cleanliness, food and service.   Service was definitely a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Picked up a to go order Father's Day 2018. Was missing an entire kids meal, the croutons were extremely stale, ribs were the cheapest disgusting piece of meat I have ever eaten. Called to let them know about my missing meal and was put on hold by an employee who was clearly not qualified to even answer the phone. I waited to talk to a manager who never came on the line. I hung up and decided to write a review. No wonder why Applebee's restaurants are closing!"}
{"text":"Been there twice.  First time we were served cold food very late and they couldn't seem to remember that we might want our drinks refilled while we waited over an hour for our food.  And our food was not \"sat too long\" cold, it was \"didn't bother cooking your shrimp\" cold.  Second time we were greeted nicely, sat down in the same section, and FIFTEEN minutes later had not given our drink order or even been looked at.  The waiter AND waitress for that section both walked by numerous times.  FORGET IT.    We left.  Smiled at the hostess and said we had yet to be seen.  Last trip to that Applebee's."}
{"text":"I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a special place for me. I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country. Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning.   So this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough. I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \"550\" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories.   So while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain. This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this one multiple times just hoping that it'll change but it never will the service is absolutely horrible it's always a terrible wait and nothing is ever right not only that but it's disappointing to wait that long just to get an order that's messed up and has to be sent back it's also not the cleanest I have noticed that everytime I'm there the tables and booths even the menus just feel sticky and unclean"}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes for a shot and a margarita... Service sucked and was slow and was not attentive at all."}
{"text":"Service was fine ...I ordered the steak salad that was so small it should be priced differently ! The dressing was to spicey and the over all experience was below average ..not impressed"}
{"text":"It's Applebees...not fine dining. Service with a smile, pretty consistent taste-wise, and off the beaten path of the strip. When we go to the mainland, Applebees is one of the places we like to hit up."}
{"text":"Came here twice, service sucked both times... Don't recommend this location. Tried to order the crispy orange chicken the second time we were there and even after waiting and some of the ingredients were recalled! Waitress tried to help me out with figuring out a new order kinda similar to my original but I was still upset. Don't come here"}
{"text":"The menu items and food were decent and VERY affordable. This location at lunch time is run VERY POORLY. The waitress took forever to bring out our food and when she finally did bring us our lunch she brought my Mother and Sons items. My food was left back in the kitchen. Which I didn't receive until AFTER I saw her walking out of a little cubby on the side of the back area of the restaurant looking baffled like she realized she forgot something.  Once my food actually arrived guess what her response was  \"Sorry we were waiting on the shrimp, and they are making us all do quizzes.\" Which really made me upset because I had heard two of the employees over by the bar discussing results. One of which happened to be the manager (a heavy set white male) I  believe his name was Jason could be wrong on that. I decided to walk over and give him a peace of my mind.  He was unapologetic and fake. Once he realized the issues at hand he came over and kneeled down and simply said \"Well how is the food now that it is here?\" honestly I have never in my life experienced a manager who was so unprofessional.  I am glad my meal was a little over $20 because that made it a STEAL. I typically tip 30% for good service this waitress got the standard 15% all because she wasn't genuine or able to realize you should NEVER tell customers excuses just Sorry. Only time I got a sorry was when I had lost my cool and she replied back with a \"WELL SORRY\"  Ugh Applebees on craig road probably doesn't care about their yelp rating but it makes me sad because the new honey crispers are delicious. They are the only reason I am happy to give 1 star."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and my experience each time has been average. The food was typical of Applebee's, but not amazing. I am a big fan of their barbecue wings, though. Those are pretty good and are my favorite appetizer there. I really like the 2 for 20 deal: we usually go for the steak."}
{"text":"Went to this Applebee's location two times. The first time was a few years back, and the bartender had terrible customer service (I'm not sure if she still works there, but I think it's worth noting). The second time I went, my girlfriend specifically asked for no onions on her sliders, and they came out with onions anyway. Also, my second round of sangria tasted like the bartender poured half a bottle of what ever they use to sweeten it, and barely any wine. I'll stick to the location by concord mills mall"}
{"text":"Well, if I gave it a lower review, I'd feel bad because, uh, I'm here and I knew what to expect.  Onto the juicy stuff:  The \"Brewtus Bahama Mama\" ranks among the worst cocktails I have ever had the misfortune of attempting to imbibe upon.  I gave it to the \"lady of the night\"down the bar.  Not sure if she liked it or if her John was just ready to rock, but it was not consumed by anyone.    The wanton tacos might have been good had I purchased it from a vending machine as a candy bar. As it was, the crunch was practically the only redeeming trait it possessed.  I gave them away as well and the dude picked everything off and savored the wontons.  The service was alright at best.  It seemed they had just cut staff for the night and then it got busy.  I wouldn't really hold that against them.  It was Thursday.  Now the positive:  The shitty, pre-frozen mozzarella sticks were, well, goddamned delicious.  Perfectly microwaved, I mean, fried to a golden brown with a crispy, crunchy exterior and a chewy, cheesy interior.  Didn't stay hot very long, but that's to be expected.  Maybe it's because I haven't had shitty, pre-frozen  mozzarella sticks in years, but they were enjoyable.  The Dos Equis was cold and crisp, no complaints there.  Now for the real twist:   Every customer there was in great spirits, laughing, having a good  time and interacted with everyone else friendily without being annoying.  It was unexpectedly refreshing.  That aspect, if isolated, deserved 5 stars.    Blew my pizza lovin' mind how positive the environment was.  To conclude, Applebees may be a shitty restaurant, but the pleasant atmosphere was almost worth the $25."}
{"text":"I usually don't take the time to write a review but I just wanted to says that the bartenders Jeff and Jon are amazing! I'm visiting from out of town and they made me feel like I was right at home. Quick and excellent service! Thank you guys for everything and I will definitely be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food tasted great. Now the bad... the happy hour margarita tasted like sour sugar syrup. I mentioned this to the server and asked for a re-pour and the bartender made it the exact same way. I eventually diluted it in about 30oz of water and it tasted like a cheap margarita... a massive improvement, but this should not be necessary, and is far stretch from how you make a margarita. Also, my girlfriend and I both had serious stomach pain the rest of the night. Don't know the culprit there, but it was something. I have great experiences with other locations, but I can't in good conscience advocate this place"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!!! Food was under cooked and ribs came pier cold. Once we asked for it to be fixed it was like they warmed the ribs up in a microwave and my steak was like rubber. Will never be back"}
{"text":"I just recently came here was expecting to eat real good because I was just starving my steak was medium the way I like it but didn't have much flavor I felt like my whole dish was just poorly made. I was not satisfied and I had paid a lot for something that was not worth it. Pretty sad about it."}
{"text":"Super slow service, our waitress was more interested in talking to her coworkers than taking care of her tables. We ordered blended drinks from the bar and she forgot to put them in to be done, we waited over 10 minutes to be greeted when we arrived. Once we ordered it took us another 45 minutes to get our food. It was a Friday night but the restaurant was half empty, tons of employees standing around doing nothing including the manager."}
{"text":"Can not go wrong with their selection. From kids menus to appetizers. They have a good happy hour. Food taste great. Bring your friends and hang out. Busier at night times but they have a place for you to wait."}
{"text":"We like Applebees and were not disappointed. The food was good and served quickly. Our waitress seemed to be extremely busy as she waited our table and several other as well mixed drinks at the bar. Even so, she serviced our table as expected.  The Asian Shrimp dish was properly cooked as well as the Popcorn Shrimp. Both were very good and sufficient quantity."}
{"text":"*Arrived before the dinner rush  *Nine occupied tables in restaurant with four servers  *Took forever to get our food *Server too busy talking to refill drinks *As soon as food comes out, server asks if we want dessert *I said I'd like to eat my meal prior to ordering dessert *Server asks me to pay on kiosk while I'm still eating *Can I finish my meal though?"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night prior to our movie since the restaurant is right next to Cineplex.  Worst decision we made.  It took 30mins for our appetizer which was the pulled pork nachos. Why nachos would take that long still boggles my mind.  We had to ask our server to check on them and informed her we where in a rush because we had a movie to get to.  The nachos where fabulous btw, I recommend them, too bad the bbq pork ribs to follow were not.  They were tough and served on measly soggy French fries.  Even worse, I didn't order French fries I ordered a Caesar salad instead, which came in a small side bowl.  I would think if one orders a salad instead of the fries that you would get a decent  sized salad and NO fries.   My husband asked our server for the bill as we wanted to pay so we could leave when ready.  She brought the bill and then disappeared!  We had to ask another server for a take out container and my husband had to go hunt down our server as she must have taken her break because she was nowhere on the floor.  Why she would take break at that time when we had asked her to settle our bill and told her we were in a hurry...who knows.  My husband even asked her why she didn't come right back to the table so he could pay and she just stood there and said nothing.  Unbelievable, she didn't seem to care or feel a need to apologize.   Needles to say we will think twice about coming back to dine...defiantly never prior to a movie.  I really wish we had just gone to Ginger Beef Bistro House instead...at least they are quick and the food comes out piping hot!!! You need to work on your service and the timing of your food especially being you are that close to a movie theatre."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of big chains.  But sometimes you gotta go with the flow.  This Applebee's, in Penn Center, is crazy wicked busy for lunch during the week.  And they are great at moving people through to get as much of our lunch money as possible.  So that means service is great.  I've only ever gotten salads here and they have always been flavorful and as presented in their commercials and menu.  The fact that they openly support the men and women in the military is a plus for me and makes me want to support this chain a little more.  Oh yes, and they also support the America's 911 MC ride.  Thanks for that, too, Applebee's - I'll try and return the favor more often!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my late grandfathers birthday and the atmosphere turned the evening into a positive one. The host seated us quickly and the server was quick to get our order started. Even recommended a few really good drinks! Rated it as 4 stars because she forgot to bring out my salad. However, after I reminded her that I ordered one she apologized and brought it out to me very quickly."}
{"text":"I stopped by here just to get a Caesar salad and meet my sister for some drinks. It wasn't busy tonight so I was happy that I wouldn't have to wait or squeeze through the large crowds.   By the time I got to the restaurant my sister had already ordered her meal. She got the shrimp and rice dish which I thought was very bland. The rice was cooked pretty well and the shrimp too but it just tasted like tomatoes nothing special.   I ordered a Cesar side salad and my hubby got the Blondie dessert dish. Both were pretty good I finished all my salad and I had a small bite of his Blondie which taste like a vanilla brownie. It wasn't 9 o'clock yet so I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the discount appetizers and drinks specials but I still managed to order me a long island. It wasn't that strong which is what I prefer but it tasted a lot like lemonade as opposed to ice tea.  I do like how they updated the place and I don't really have any bad things to say about it but it is just a typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. most of the food sometimes does taste like it came from a microwave package. I guess it's what you can expect from a chain place although there are some better Applebee's but this one just happened to be the closest to my house."}
{"text":"Just left from having a Horrible Dinner. We had Raw Bacon in our Mac and chz . The waitress brought out our food ,and then told us she was out of Chicken tenders, for my Son. The spinach Dip was not cooked, and we had empty drinks for at least 20 min. Horrible.. The manger Terry, really did try to make up for the horrible food by giving us free dessert. I'm leaving hungry, and finding uncooked bacon pieces in my mouth.Disgusting.. I think I'll go vomit now.. Thanks AppleBees..."}
{"text":"The Hostess was the worst. Not very inviting in fact she was rude. My waiter was ok. The food was good and the drinks even better. But the hostess that works at this location Saturday night after 10pm. I definitely won't be back if she is the one in the front. Had it not been for the hour I would have definitely went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Thursday August 20th about 12:30 PM. Wasn't to busy. My oldest son just started at ASU, so a very convenient location to visit since it's near the college. Customer service was extremely good. Had Julia (staff trainer) who was and her new trainee. Very attentive to our needs and request. Food was good and so was the service. Complemented their efforts with having two servers at our table. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Dined here on 8-29 about 8:30 PM. Double crusted bone in hot wings good, but needed additional sauce. Ordered the Blazing Texan Burger & asked for it in the flour tortilla like they do for the quesadilla burger which they accommodated. Clubhouse sandwich is always a favorite in our family, good with \"Garlic Fries\". You have to request them! Our waiter was Parley W. He was attentive to our needs and provided us with good service."}
{"text":"It's been some time since we've been to an Applebee's. Decided to go-as they'd sent me a Birthday Special. A BOGO deal.  Came in Saturday evening 12/ 9 and sat at the bar. Andrew was our server & bartender. Very pleasant & accommodating.  I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt after seeing many of the negative reviews. I think some are honest and a few others not so much!   I can say we had issues with utensil cleanliness. Prior to our meal we had to asked for another set of forks.  Wings came out not as requested, kitchen error and it was resolved in a very professional manner. Those were tasty! Double Crunch, never a bad thing when it comes to crispy chicken & sauce!  Ordered the Sirloin Steaks (Butchers Reserve). *Keep in mind for later * that again it's suppose to be the \"Buy one, get one : of equal or lesser value FREE\"! Steak Meals were $18.99 each. We ordered 1 medium and the other medium rare. Medium rare my husband felt was over cooked. However, it was a 12 oz \"uneven\" butcher cut, so the thicker piece was medium rare and thinner piece was medium well. My cut was more balanced and cook perfectly.  Can order two sides. Both of us had the garlic green beans which are good. I had the baked potato and was asked if I wanted it loaded. \"Sure\"! It's $2.99 additional for adding bacon & green onion. When it arrived it had 3 very small pieces of bacon and no green onion? *See Pic* I requested a side of both: since I was paying for it! That request was met with no complaints. My husband had the garlic mashed potatoes & they were good. Both meals we just ok.  My son came in a little later with his girlfriend, so we added the sampler platter to our bill that they shared. $13.99  Drinks were pricey $8.50 for vodka tonics (grey goose) NOT a double! LOL Beers weren't at Happy Hour Price even with getting there at just before 6PM. The bartender made reference to that when he served us our first set of drinks.  At the end of service when we presented the coupon, the bartender took off the sampler platter? They didn't read their own fine print nor honor the coupon the way it was supposed to be offered. I told my husband it should have been one of our steak meals comp'ed?! He wasn't going to bring it up after the charge had gone through. We still paid over $100!   Applebee's has really deteriorated over the years. From management to staff it just is average in my opinion. A fast food chain that use to be very successful , but over the years has declined. I don't think we will be back anytime soon to dine."}
{"text":"I normally do not go to large restaurant chains, and do my best to avoid it at all costs. Big chains like this are really for tourists and the prices always tend to not be friendly for the portions served. Also, because their food is just a let down. My visits to Applebees is always on very rare occasions and only occur every few years.   However, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I came here for lunch the other day. My friends insisted on coming here and assured me it would not be a letdown like the NYC locations. I went with my gut instinct and I have to say I really enjoyed my lunch. I got the bourbon chicken and shrimp (super delish)! Additionally, I found the staff to be super friendly, attentive, and our food arrived nice and HOT! I liked the vibe of the place and the staff seemed to have a sense of urgency. The same can't be said for the ones in NYC. The staff in NYC seem hellbent and letting this chain go bankrupt.   I would definitely go back on my future vacation to Vegas. Oh, and our waitress was beyond excellent!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, there was a boy with glasses, and 2 girls, at the hostess stand. Why do u need 3 frickin people at a hostess stand?????? They were soooooo rude to us. They literally did not say hi to us when we walked in. And to make matters worse, they glared at us, and looked us up and down like we were trash. That ruined our whole experience. We won't be back.. You need to fire their asses."}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to write this review, as I hate to write anything bad and I do not want to bash Applebee's. I've had great experiences at others, but will not return to this one.  Our waitress introduced herself by telling us she has dental issues and is hopped up on pain pills. Eeew,I don't think anyone wants to hear about rotten teeth before their meal. She proceeded to torture all the tables around ours with the same story. (Not sure why she was at work while essentially intoxicated?)  Our food took 45 minutes. The manager came to the table to tell us that my steak went to the wrong table and they had to make me another one. My steak was bloooody. I ordered it medium. I was so bummed about this entire experience.  My husband and I have limited time together and this was our afternoon to enjoy. We spent it waiting and waiting on our food and listening to the waitress slur through her personal stories.  Sorry guys, not sure what's acceptable over there.  Can you turn it around?  I give 1 star because the manager (reluctantly) refunded me the price of my steak."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant quite disorganized than this one. From the moment I  arrived the wait staff seemed to be very flustered. A lot of complaining from the servers about how many people were in their placed in their sections and bickering. It's very distracting and obnoxious when customers are trying to eat. The service was very slow considering my drink order wasn't even taken for 10 minutes after I was seated.  Food was average for this type of restaurant.The most distributing behavior was when the manager corrected a server on the floor. People were walking past and I even noticed it since I was sitting near the kitchen and heard every word. Very unprofessional. One would think you'd pull that person into a room but apparently that's not how this Applebee's works. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Everything was great, but the wait was too long, and the wait for the food was even longer. The cook on the steak was over, but I didn't want to send it back to have to wait all over again. The service was great once we were seated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and some half-price wings at the bar. Service was fine, wings were good."}
{"text":"Me, wife and daughter out to eat at Applebees in Gibsonia. Usually have ok meals and good service. Not this night. Ordered 9oz sirloin medium rare. came back medium well, sent it back at the servers insistence and I watched while my wife and daughter ate their dinners. 20 minutes later my food arrived again, steak tasted odd, like it was spoiled and still not even cooked right. Sides were not redone either, they just stuck the potato and broccoli under the lamp. soggy, disgusting, inedible food. could not eat  it at all. The manager came over and offered us nothing but to remove that one meal from the check. ridiculous. I wrote to the company,  and the manager, Mark called me and we discussed it. He sent me 2 $10 gift cards to 'entice' me back. I sent them back to him telling him that this was insulting. they cannot cook, service was good, but the manager and other manager were incompetent, patronizing,  and almost offensive for what they offered us. My wife and daughter's meals were just OK, not great. They dropped the ball and will never have us or anyone I talk to as customers ever again."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you don't care about service or being served your food in a timely manner and each meal at the same time.  2 kids got their meals then 15 minutes later 2 adults got theirs and the 3rd adult's still wasn't done when they were finished eating! The manager had the wait staff box up his meal to go. And, the food was a little warmer than room temperature when we got it! The whole dining room staff was apologizing to the customers left and right for the food not being up to par. Will never go to this location again!"}
{"text":"Friday night and we headed to Applebee's - always good food and good service. Lots of people in and out . We sat inside and watched everyone get seated. I went up and asked the hostess 'how much more time before we get seated as I noticed some were getting seated before us. I looked on her list and we were crossed out about 5 ppl ago. I was not happy! She said ' I swear I called it' . I just looked at her puzzled. I was sitting there and I could literally name the ones that went before me. She never said ours- I'm quite sure of that. Grrrrr"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.   Ate in during lunch last week.  Server not too attentive.    Got take out tonight. Sat night.  Ordered online. Order was never placed.  Bartender lied when I went to pick it up.   She says she never saw the order. Then says \" oh. No it was placed. I just didn't see it and that she only had to pack it up.   \" 15 mins later I got my order.   Cup of Soup pictured on this site..was half filled...pasta was dried out and hard.. hardly  any sauce.   Just overall bad experience. They need better met.  This has been going on at this location, literally for years."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on our day off - we've been meaning to come to Applebees for a while but it never comes up when we're deciding for dinner.  We arrived just about noon and it wasn't very busy. Definitely a lot of older people in during the week at lunchtime. We were seated right away and told about the new updated menu. The menu has definitely changed since the last time I was here, complete overhaul with lots of new options. They had a 2 for $25 or 2 for $30 deal on, two entrees from a list with an appetizer to share and we ended up going with that.  My boyfriend got the chicken fingers and I ended up with the crunchy shrimp platter and we got the mozarella sticks for an app. The mozz sticks were pretty  good, super crispy outside, ooey gooey inside and they were thick, not super thin like most mozz sticks I've had before. My shrimpies were tasty, very crispy and I had them with onion rings, which were surprisingly good. Also very crispy but stayed together in one piece when bitten into (the Guy Fieri test). The fries were nothing special though and the gravy was a bit thin, although tasty.  Service was very good, our server was attentive and helpful with the new menu, pointing out some options that she recommended. Given that we had an all fried lunch that was good but  not amazing, I'm sticking with three stars with the intent to come back and try something else to get a sense of what their new menu is like. But I was pleased with the value and the new menu looks pretty good so I'd recommend it for a simple lunch out or a dinner at a good price."}
{"text":"Not my favorite restaurant but it's what my nephew wanted. Some old food but the pasta I had was.flavorful and well prepared . Their team is terrible, so order extra lemon."}
{"text":"Wait time was long... but the place just felt dirty. The booth was cracked and cushion falling apart, the menu was grimy and my glass ware was dirty... hopefully they see this review as constructive criticism. This place needs a major face lift!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so poor here...First time going there as my friend wanted to have lunch there.    We both chose the avocado burger (since I was in a burger mood), and it was really good!! The fries were pretty good too.  The desserts - we ordered 2 - Both chocolate desserts, lava cake with ice cream and the chocolate brownie.  Absolutely delicious ! Everything on that plate was finished and not because we were hungry.  It was THAT good! and I am not a big dessert person.  I blame her for being pregnant that we ordered 2. lol    Everything around us smelt good and looked good too so if you haven't been, give it a shot."}
{"text":"We went for their new ribs. They were cold then heated up and re served.  Horrible. Unable to eat. Left without eating. Manager was apologetic. Just horrible."}
{"text":"My Family used to eat here quite a bit a few years ago but has steadily declined to the point where I can no longer recommend.  The service is slow, but I think it's more the kitchen than the servers.  The last 2 times I was there the servers were very attentive, but the food took forever to come out.  To make it worse, they brought out the appetizers and the entree together... Both Times!   Not a fan anymore, too many other choices in the area that a simply better!"}
{"text":"Giving this experience only a 3 star based strictly on the service from the waitress!   The hostess's were DINGY, not paying a bit of attention. Asked for a booth, was told, \"we don't have any to sit you at\". Fine we will take a table. While walking thru a semi busy evening, we walked by 3 empty BOOTHS. THREE! Clearly they hostess was not paying attention. I said something and nothing in reply. Waitress heard and said, you can sit at that booth, it's open. Manger came over, apologized. Whoopty do.  As a manager, train your front end! And 57 dollars with NO drinks for bagged frozen food is RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"Our hostess was the best part. They did sing to my three year old grandson, which was nice.  The food we ordered just wasn't good.  :(  Two of us got the pretzels and cheese. The cheese looked and tasted  like gravy made with no spices, including salt. The pretzels were gummy textured. We asked the waiter for regular cheese sauce and he told us emphatically that they had NO OTHER cheese sauce! Then the manager was walking by tables to ask if things were ok. We told him the cheese was gross, then he said he would bring us some QUESO sauce. Uh..... yeah, ok. The queso sauce really wasn't good either.  I ordered the three app plate. We waited quite a while before we called to tell them they hadn't delivered one of my apps. When it arrived it wasn't really hot, even though Hot is in the name.   Our server wandered off twice. The second time for so long I actually called the restaurant we were sitting to ask them to find him!  The place was clean, and everyone was friendly. So it was a meh. Probably stick with h Friday's from now on."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I've taken the kids here twice in the last week. They're amazing and the service to me is amazing. I enjoy Tuesdays for kids because the meals are 99cent per two kids with one adult. Nice and chill environment, and very kid friendly."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!!  I have been in the state for 4 months and this is the WORST restaurant choice we have made so far. I had a bad feeling and should have listened to my instinct. Wasted $40.  Let me start by saying the host/hostess were the nicest staff at the place.   My husband ordered the 7 oz sirloin with riblets, seasonal vegatables and mashed potatoes. The sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery. There was no meat to be eaten. It was just a hunk of fat. The riblets even had a weird smoke flavor that he compared to cigarette smoke. We do not go places looking for an all smiles server, but this guy did not smile and when he saw we were not enjoying our meal and my husband's plate was still full, he did not even ask if the food was okay or if there was something he could do. We don't like to complain and just were not in the mood to even let him or the manager know. I really did not expect the food to be so bad. I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip. For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed. The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi. Sad. We will not be returning. For such a nice \"looking\" exterior, you would think they'd have more quality food and servers. I guess you get what you pay for..sadly.  Do not go here! We will be voiding it like the plague."}
{"text":"Terrible curbside service. Given wrong order then second order was incomplete. Basically ignored once I went inside. Nobody working there knows what is going on. Had to ask for a receipt. The receipt given only had the total amount due and not itemized. Our food was cold. Absolutely will never go to an Applebee's again."}
{"text":"Two stars or rather one and a half because the food was alright. We waited a long time to be acknowledged and served and were just about to get up and leave when he finally came over. Slow, slow service but he did come back and check up on us so I guess that's a plus. There's a lot of Applebee's around the valley though and I think you'd have a better choice going to a different one especially if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"When we first got in there, we were seated immediately and we were told that our waiter would be on her way. 10 minutes of waiting, she finally came up just to get our drink orders. Whatever. So after waiting another 5 minutes just to get our drinks, she stares right at us and tells somebody else to bring us our drinks. Then we wait another 10 minutes after getting our drinks for her to come back and take our order. In the middle of us talking and giving her our order, she starts walking to the table behind her and rushes our ordering process. But then she spends a 5-8 minutes with this table talking about what's in everything they want to order. Of course it was another 10 minute wait for the food and our server wasn't the one who served it. Our food was very average. We could've made the food at home for a cheaper price. Because of the waitress being so rude to us, we'll never go there again."}
{"text":"I came here after picking my son up for a quick snack. The manager Angela is honestly amazing, she was very proactive and responsive with my issue. I am not a chain restaurant person, but because of her I will return."}
{"text":"i love this applebee's !!!! everyone is super friendly!  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie! so yummy"}
{"text":"My wife and I meet there for dinner after work occasionally and generally feel the food is pretty good for the price and usually have decent waitress. The last time I was there the waitress kept disappearing and we had to ask another one for another drink and she never came back to see how we were doing. By the time we were ready to go we were pretty disgusted and I asked another waitress to take our check, cut the tip to 10% and told her to keep it instead of our waitress. While going up Greentree road I looked up at the restaurant and saw our waitress outside smoking. I blame the manager for this. Whoever the manager is should not let this go on."}
{"text":"Where to start??  Came in was greeted by David who took our drink order. We asked what they had on draft but he did not know what was on draft so he had to go look at the bar area and came back. He came back 5 minutes after taking our drink order because he forgot what kind of beer we had ordered. When he brought our drinks we asked about the advertisement that they had on the table which stated that if the server did not offer a margarita you would get free churro. We mentioned this to him because he did not mention the margaritas and he claimed that he had mentioned them??  Hmm seriously? We let it go and continued to wait for our food.  20 minutes later the manager \"Deb\" came over and told us that the sandwich we had ordered couldn't be brought out because they didn't have enough meat for it but whatever we ordered instead would be on the house. Ok so we ordered something else and waited again.  10 minutes later some of the food arrived. One of the things that arrived wasn't what we had ordered, 2 of the other entrees didn't have both of the sides and we were waiting for the last 2 entrees.   The remaining of the food FINALLY arrived and it did not look appetizing at all. We told the manager about our complains and she got defensive and told us that the entrees only come with 2 sides... But we only had one side and were missing the other one. She did not apologize or seem to care. Customer service was not there at all!!  I am very disappointed and will not come here again."}
{"text":"Its pretty cool to hang out at...very 3 out 5 chill places to come to....i always get the 2 for 20 and im getting tired of tge menu for ut honestly i consider every month change up the spice man....aint nobody got time for chicken and fries up in here."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. It was horrible from the get go. It took our sever 7 min before she even acknowledge our table. And then she brought our salads and no silverware. My wife had to get up and get some from the host. A table right next to us got the dinners before us and we ordered before them. It took almost 45 min to get our food. My entree looked like it was under the heat lamp for 20 min. I will never come back to this place. They couldn't pay me enough to eat there"}
{"text":"1/17/2017. After being screwed out of a proper reservation at another nearby restaurant, Applebee's saved our butts. Wife and I were seated quickly for a Saturday night, and had a nice birthday dinner. Shrimp n steak for me, and Butchers meat and potatoes for her. Zachary was our server, and he was pleasant, helpful and attentive. Good experience. I was unhappy when I walked in the door but Zack and Applebee's turned me around."}
{"text":"Like their steak. The $20 dollar menu was good and economic. The buffalo boneless wings are good, too. Its better than average."}
{"text":"The caprese burger onions were so thickly sliced I had to remove them. They were a half inch thick, bigger than the patty. My husband's grilled vegetables looked pathetic, the spinach was way overcooked. My mother in law had a salad with nearly no protein and nothing but nuts and cabbage. Wait time was subpar. I'm remind why I stay away from Applebees altogether. No wonder Applebees locations are closing everywhere."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with high hopes. Greatly disappointed however.  We had Sirloin steak stirfry and three cheese Mac with chicken.  The best way I can describe these meals would be to say they had the look, taste and appeal of something you went to the refrigerator grabbed what you could find and threw together. The stirfry steak was good but the stirfry was very little stirfry on lots of rice.  The Mac and cheese,  chicken drenched in a sweet syrup on to of the dish, didn't work.  All round, keep looking, you'll surely find much better than this."}
{"text":"For my money,The Two 4 entrees with appetizer is a much better deal that MCDONALDS SUPERSIZED MENU hands down."}
{"text":"We have our family dinner before we left to go back Hawaii.   The wait was so and so because we had a big party. Love the specials they have for dinner but the amount of food is a little. The deserts was a plus.   I'm a sweet tooth and I fell in love with desert over there.   The sad thing my brother food is over cook but  glad they didn't charge us and offer free dessert. Love the customer services. Thanks for fixing the problem."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but was very impressed by the excellent customer service the manager Mary provided. I ordered curbside yesterday & got home to find the order was incorrect, I called to launch my complaint & she was apologetic, took down my information & told me she would make it right whenever I wanted to return. I called back today to place the replacement order & she remembered me, put the order in personally & I am now here to pick up. I realize human error occurs so I was fine with that but more than pleased with the level of professionalism in correcting my order, Thank You Again Manager Mary!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great when you first walk in. Very welcoming, the host is very friendly and knowledgeable.   We sat down, ordered 2 waters, one coffee, one Pepsi and a long island ice tea.   Coffee was so so, the Long Island ice tea was just weak and the truth of the matter is, long islands are meant to be stronger than other mixed drinks.   I ordered a beer after because I would rather drink something with more flavor. (Imagine that) lol   Everyone else's food came out alright  , we ordered an appetizer platter.   Here is where the problem became about...  3 appetizers.   Chips and salsa Mozzarella sticks Cheese quesadilla (no chicken)   Don't eat meat btw*   Sooo...   Quesadilla came with chicken , returned it, came back again with chicken,   Mozzarella sticks were cold meaning cheese wasn't melted   So the chips and salsa won! Lol   Great service I guess... lol I blame it on the kitchen because our food was returned more than once.    Advice ?   Manager , where were you?   Kitchen , pay attention to your tickets.   Cheers !"}
{"text":"The food snob in me actually found this so yummy . I haven't eaten at Applebee's in awhile, I honestly was never excited about any of the food here.    This last visit definitely changed my perception of the matthews location . I liked the chalk board at the door showing the \"chef\" for the night. I noticed the menu is completely different and has several options , even a \"lighter fare\" for us watching our waistline from time to time . I did order from this section bc I'm always ecstatic to see complex carbs, power packed proteins, and nutrition information on meals in restaurants.    For those who remember or enjoyed Applebee's 2 for 20 dine in menu options, it's still here , and looks like they \"beefed\" up the choices as well.   I ordered the sirloin steak from the lighter menu options,  which came with a bed of saut√©ed spinach on whole grain and mushrooms. I must say everything was seasoned nicely with a good portion size for 380 calories . My love had the sirloin and shrimp, with sweet potato casserole , and saut√©ed green beans. That sweet potato casserole was delicious . We also had drinks , a delicious Margarita for me and a top shelf LIT for him, good job bartender,  those drinks definitely had kick ,no watered down spirits here."}
{"text":"So after a night of drinking at the Fiesta, we decided to come here to grub on some late night munchies.  Our server's name was Adam and we decided to get the pick two for $24.  I know it's usually $20, but we chose the items that they charged an extra $2 each for.    We started with the Spinach and Artichoke dip which is always a good time.  Very creamy and very hot, served with a lime salsa and homemade tortilla chips. We then ordered Caesar salads on the side.  Seriously could have been our meal, it was huge.  Now the reason why our meal was a little more than $20 was the fact that my friend got a blackened steak pasta and I got the Crunchy shrimp.  My shrimp was crispy and served with a slaw, cocktail sauce and fries.  I was surprised by the amount of shrimp that came on the plate.  I don't often come here because there are so many other options in this town and I personally feel that places like Applebees, or Chilis is super blase.  I think the fact that I was drunk really helped the taste of the food as well as the experience.  LOL.    Thanks, Applebees for fulfilling my drunken hunger."}
{"text":"We had a little misunderstanding with the waiterp we were initially placed with. The manager, Anthony, came over expeditiously and not only solved the problem but made the experience great. The other waitresses and bar staff are awesome and completely turned the experience around. I highly recommend Visiting this location!"}
{"text":"This particular Applebees is a great fun time on Thursdays! They have live music of Brian Legate and the whole bar gets into the act. Sometimes the waiter will get up there and sing with him. He plays rock music and takes requests. What I love about this Applebees is they always remember you when you come in. They even remember your favorite drinks. You'll be lucky if you get Roxy or Wendy as a waitress. they are fun! Happy Hour has $2 beers and $4 Long Island Ice Teas!! Oh and wings for $4 too."}
{"text":"After driving around for awhile and trying to figure out what to get for dinner I just settled for here. I wasn't so happy with my decision and was almost positive I wasn't going to love my dinner. But it was convenient and better than fast food. Once we walked through the the front door I was feeling hopeful. We were greeted very nicely at the door. Once we sat our server DJ greeted us immediately. She was probably the best server I've ever gotten, not just here but ever. She consistently checked on us. Made special accommodations and all with a smile on her face. When she saw we didn't get our food yet, she assured us it was coming soon. She didn't skip a beat. I would come back again! Especially if she's our server. In the end, I didn't regret my decision for doing dinner here only because the service was so great."}
{"text":"Three strikes you're out! This place has been awful every time we have come here over the past year. I've tried time and time again to give it another chance, but, it always ends up being a horrible experience. It seems to never be the food (though its not great) but the service.  Let's take a look at why I am done with this place.  The first bad experience I had here was earlier this year. My friends and I all came for dinner. My boyfriend was with me, and ordered a kiwi lemonade. The waitress didn't bother to write anything down and came back with a kiwi slush. He told her he did not order that, and we all backed him up. She got snooty and told him to just keep it and then brought the kiwi lemonade. Here is the kicker. We get the bill and she charged him for BOTH. She charged him for her mistake! We argued with her and she begrudgingly took it off his bill.  Second bad experience was us just wanting a blondie. We get there and the waitress comes and get's our drink orders, brings are drinks, and then is sucked into the 5th dimension because we never see her again. Our drinks were never refilled and we waited OVER AN HOUR for sub par food. I know what you are thinking, maybe it was busy, yes it was, but even a busy restaurant never takes that long for food. We got no apology, no compensation at all. The waitress was exceptionally attentive to the table behind us, too bad we were invisible to her.  Last bad experience was last night. We were going to see an 11 o'clock movie that was playing right across the street. It was a little after 10 and we decided to try this place one more time to get some appetizers. We get our drink orders in at 10:15, and  their must be some kind of worm hole in this Applebee's because the waiter disappeared too! It's nearly 11, still no food, place is dead, and we need to go. My friend tracks down our waiter and he says food is done, wait another 10 minutes, still no food. Decide to leave. I will add we didn't see our waiter until my friend tracked him down.  Thankfully waiter only charged us for drinks.   If anyone working for this Applebees reads this, fix your service! No one cares how good your food is if we never get to eat it!"}
{"text":"We are back to this restorant. Once again we had a great time. The surver was very profetionale. Did not wait long time to order. I liked the salmon."}
{"text":"Our server was a sweetheart, drinks were good, but that's it. The tomato basil soup was sadly really bad and the music was terribleeeeeeee! Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 3 - Regular. I mean, it's Applebee's! It actually feels a bit cramped on the upper levels.   SERVICE: 4 - Excellent. Our server was very helpful and funny. She was attentive and polite. It was exactly how a server should be! I know it was slow, but she checked on us way too much!   FOOD: 3 - It's true, there are big deals here and real money to be saved! They even revamped their entire menu, and I got the steak on the 2 for 25 deal (including appetizer), but I have to be honest, it wasn't good. The food at this Applebee's has just deteriorated over the years and become painfully average. Though my mom did order the strawberry avocado salad, which was probably the best thing on the menu!   The only reason I like coming to this Applebee's location is because of their happy hour (big drinks at $5-6, I think) and they've always had a great bartender that works there! My favorite Long Island comes out of this Applebee's!   So my final advice, when you're at Applebee's, (I think you know it!) \"a happy hour is a happy day!\""}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a quick meal.... not so quick. We weren't expecting the red carpet rolled out for us, but from the time we sat down until the time we left the service was terrible. Our waiter appeared to be very overwhelmed, or just miserable, and scatterbrained. Everyone that worked here looked miserable. Our chips were stale for our appetizer, and it took ten minutes to get a drink refill. Our waiter actually commented out loud about a poor tip he received from the table next to us (he didn't get their order right and was not attentive at all). The fire alarm even went off when we were here and the manager said nothing. It appears they need better customer service and maybe a little more time spent on the food. Probably wouldn't come back here unless everywhere else on McKnight road burned down."}
{"text":"Who is responsible for silverware on the tables??? Wife and I tried this place again after a terrible past experience.  Sat down, no silverware. Drinks took 20 minutes to show. Floor had food everywhere. Several tables around us had no silverware as people were not happy. Waitress (Key)  didn't tell us any specials to start. We had to ask. She knew no prices of drinks. I know, I know you guys were  slammed with people and were probably short- handed just like every restaurant on a Sat. night......time to grow up here and catch up with the rest of food establishments out there......."}
{"text":"It's kinda my fault. I should have yelped this location first. But most Applebee's I've frequented have been decent.  The service was good. But the food wasn't up to par. My wife and I had their 2/$20 deal. Spinach & Artichoke appetizer was so-so. Not much flavor. My wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta. She says it was \"alright.\" (I made the same thing at home last week and mine was better) I had the chicken and shrimp skillet. The shrimps were small and just warm. they were probably cooked ahead and spooned on top later. The chicken breast was overcooked and dry. Served with fried red potatoes and a mushroom and onion stirfry, I hesitated to send it back fearing retaliation (if you know what I mean) on a different meal.  Now I'm totally turned off by going to another Applebee's whereever I travel. Should have went to get burgers at Five Guys in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waitress was VERY SLOW, forgetful, and spacey. Salads came out with entrees instead of before. She brought the wrong drink for one of us and forgot the drink for one of the kids in our group. Love Applebees but not this one."}
{"text":"My wife works across the street at the Sunrise Hospital.  Any time we meet for lunch we always choose Applebee's.   The service is friendly and quick especially if you sit in the bar.  The 2 for 20 is our go to choice for a cheap lunch.  We have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took 20min to get entr√©e out. Took 10min to get drinks and also waited 8 min before server came to table."}
{"text":"I've come to decide that the only chain restraints I like are far and few. This place definitely is just alright and I probably wouldn't come back because I feel like for the food we received I wouldn't come back and pay those prices when I can go to family owned businesses and get a better deal but the fact that I'm helping a smaller business and not a chain sits better with me.   We came after trying to choose a place to eat late Tuesday night. My boyfriend wanted Pasta so this place was the only place open on a Tuesday night at 10 close to home. I've had Applebee's before many times. Mainly when I was younger and didn't have a say where we were going to eat. Came in and it was pretty chill. Some tables filled but not packed. Our server was polite and friendly. So that's a place but probably the only one. I wasted to order pasta but I just couldn't decide. So thought I would have a appetizer and soup. Appetizers were happy hour price. Our server informed me they didn't have any French onion soup :/ so I had no idea what I was going to order. I've had tequila like chicken in the past but didn't feel like eating that. I wound up ordering wonton tacos which were pretty decent. The fact that they were $3.50 helped a little. Had a typical Asian type glaze on the chicken and had cabbage served in crispy wonton shells. My boyfriend had pasta with shrimp. Forgot the name but the flavor was bland and forgettable anyway. Shrimp pasta ? Lacking  some shrimp IMO. For $14 It wasn't worth it.  Do yourself a favor and stick to local businesses and stay away from chain restraunts. Unless it's In N Out or Chipotle. For those places you have my permission ;)"}
{"text":"one of the worst experinces at a restaurant! we got sat and it took about 15mins for our server to acknowledge us which would be understandable if the restaurant was busy but it wasn't.. took another 15 to get our drinks and when we went to give our order to the server her package of birth control landed almost in my lap then it took her about 20 mins for her to even put our order in because she was having a personal conversation with a table across from us which were her friends so we pretty much know the girls whole life story and what not and she carried her cigarettes and phone ans lighter in her back pocket all around tacky she didnt bring us our good another server did we waited 10mins and had to get up and find silverware in order to even start to eat our meal. im beyond upset with this experience i have been a server for 8+years and am a manager for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Eatin good in the neighborhood. They have totally remodeled this whole building and the place looks great now. applebees is the best place to go to just for a quick bite to eat, if you wanna eat cheap and good this is it."}
{"text":"The food is like every other Applebees and our waitress was really sweet. However, we waited almost an hour to get seated because the hostess crossed out my name without calling it."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to go to eat.  Service is very friendly, and the background chatter is usually quite low.  Babies are quite welcome here, and no one gives you a hard time about your child making noise (as long as it's within reasonable limits, of course).  As for the food?  I know people like to give Applebee's grief about their perceived lack of quality/taste, but I have absolutely no complaints.  My wife really loves their steak here (and she's not a steak eater *at all*), for one thing.  And for another, their 2 for $20 menu is pretty economical (my wife and I order off of it every time we come).  Really, going to any of these chain casual dining restaurants is an exercise in expectation management.  Is it going to be the world's most amazing gourmet food?  Of course not.  Is it some glorious temple in which foodies and aspiring hipsters can congregate and worship?  No, there are many better options for that crowd (and they're welcome to them!).  And maybe if I weren't married with kids, my opinion would be like theirs.  But really, in my old age I've come to appreciate kid-friendly restaurants with friendly service and no-nonsense food -- and Applebee's delivers in that arena."}
{"text":"Applebee's.. not really my choice to eat, but ended up here cause my aunt loves this place.  I must admit their values menu is pretty cool the 2 for 20$ Menu and it comes with an appetizer.  I ended up ordering the chicken fingers basket with ranch and honey mustard and my aunt ordered the same thing and we had the spinach and artichoke dip..  Applebee's is way low key nice place just to relax, grab american food. Their food is decent, and an ok place to meet up with friends..  I would go back to applebee's suprisingly their menu and service has improved over the years.."}
{"text":"Thu/2 May about 6:45 pm had dinner here with 6 other people: - Service was excellent and everyone in my group enjoyed their meal. - We went with mostly the \"2 for $20 Menu\" which includes 1 appetizer + 2 entrees.  For appetizer it was the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which also included some salsa and when we were low on chips we asked the server to bring us some and she hooked us up.  For entrees my seatmate (she sat next to me) had the Applebee's Riblet Basket and I had the 7 oz House Sirloin.  A couple of people had dessert (it looked to be the Oreo Shooter and a Chocolate Mousse Cake). - It was one friend's birthday and when I mentioned it to the server she orchestrated the whole Appleebee happy birthday thing where the staff comes out with a free dessert item for the birthday person."}
{"text":"Early lunch at 11.30. Saw advertisements for 7.99 burgers. Thought we would give it a try. Saw previous yelp reviews and was hesitant. Seating was prompt and courteous. Waitress was very friendly. Burgers were excellent. Very happy and will return."}
{"text":"Horrible service went there to have a nice dinner with my wife and we had horrible service. The food came cold and when it was time to leave we could not get anyone to come to our table to get the check but saw all the girls at the bar talking and laughing. I am never going back to that place."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night (May 5th 2018) because he loves this place and neither of us wanted to be cooking so we ended up here.  Our server was lovely and was totally okay with switching the fish tacos to chicken tacos for me, which I super appreciated cause I hate fish and it was Cinco De Mayo (trying to get my tacos in righttt???) Clearly a busy Saturday night but everything went smoothly. However, we took our extra food home with us and a few hours later when my boyfriend went to eat his red skinned garlic mashed potatoes, he found a corner piece of a plastic bag in his potatoes!! I have worked in the restaurant industry for 5+ years and I understand stuff like this is bound to happen sooner or later but clearly preventable. I'm giving three stars because the server was lovely and provided quick service!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were killing time waiting for the dogs to get groomed, so we came here for lunch.   The food was what you expect. We got the sampler with like 5 different things, great to snack on and catch up! Tons of food!  However, this 5 star review is all because of our server, Thomas. He was so sweet and so attentive. It is so rare to encounter someone who you can tell actually enjoys their job! Keep up the good work, Thomas!"}
{"text":"It's horrible!!! First experience, bartender came in from a cigarette break smelling like she smoked  the whole pack. No signs of being refreshed (washing hands, etc), she immediately started making drinks. And to think I gave them a second chance!!! Second experience bartender only tended to her regulars. I ordered two drinks, she only brought one back. She never asked were we ok, never inquired about an addition to our order. I gave her my debit card, she sat it down only to walk away to make another drink for her regular customers. She then walked back telling me she no longer needed my card she swiped it. I stated, \"No you sat it on the counter, left it there to make someone else a drink, you never swiped it.\" She stated, \"I'm the only one here, I'm sorry.\" When people apply for the WrongProfession.Com. There was no excuse for that treatment and there is no reason I'll come back again."}
{"text":"If you haven't been then you are missing out! We call this the gem of Tempe! You will not find another place that serves colder beer on tap! The blue moon is a personal favorite and you won't be disappointed! Their great happy hour as well as content food deals including .40 cent wings will make you wanting to come back again and again! Joey is by far the best bartender so if he is there say hi and ask for his \"Strong Island\" made by Joey!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical Applebees. I would normally give three stars, but there was no wait and service was quick, so I'll round it up to four."}
{"text":"Very nice server and manager. However, I waited 30 minutes for my order, only to be told that they were out of steaks for the day. Consequently, I was dissatisfied with the establishment this time around."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend always come here on our days off. The staff is absolutely amazing. We always order potato twisters and are never let down! The Bartenders are usually our servers and they always make us feel welcomed. The management always comes to check up on us, which I think is a very good quality. This is my favorite place by far (:"}
{"text":"Yum yum, best steak that I have had in awhile. Fun lunch day with the family. I come to this Applebee's once in awhile and the server was great!"}
{"text":"Besides the multiple disappointments (didn't have items that were on the menu, draft system was out of order, only 2 of 3 meals served, employees congregated at the front with their heads buried in their phones), the restaurant employees crossed the line. One employee intentionally knock the silverware basket on the ground; another did nothing. A third picked up the silverware from the ground, put it the basket and back up on the shelf for service. Less than a minute later a couple walked in and the employee that pick the silverware up off the ground reached into the basket and started to walk the couple to the table. Don't worry, I stepped in and stopped the couple from getting the silverware and asked for the manager. Unfortunately, the manager didn't strike me as someone who would actually follow through and take action. AVOID!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times sat at the bar and had a few appetizers, love the bartender she has always been great.. I totally wish today I would have sat at the bar just like every other time, needless to say I was terribly disappointed with the service, food and overall experience, not only did I have to wait for a waiter once he finally came to \"help\" he was rushed and short got us some waters and came back to take our order, after taking our order we waited at least 15 minutes before we saw him again at which point we asked him to bring us a couple drinks, once he brought our drinks my fianc√© realized his beer was not the one he had ordered, he then waited for this waiter Richard H. To come back so he could address the issue, once we were able to see him we noticed he was busy with another table so my fianc√© went to the bar and asked the bartender to change his beer for the one he had originally ordered, we waited about 20 additional minutes and our food finally arrived it was cold and stiff I tried to mention it but Richard kept running up and down our area he finally asked me if I wanted some A1 sauce, at this point I was halfway into my steak I was so hungry and didn't wanna go through the hassle of having to wait an additional 20+ minutes for my food..... He finally brought our bill after asking if we wanted some desert... We put our debit card on the card holder and he took it but when he brought the bill back for it to be signed our card had gone missing... To be later found in his apron!!! I was very disappointed angry and irritated all I wanted to do is leave.. Needless to say I will not be coming back here and will not recommend this location to anyone else!!"}
{"text":"Applebee's was on point tonight!!! We stopped in for dinner and were very pleased. Our server, Joey,  was personable, funny and attentive. His recommendation for the blackberry sangria was an excellent one. I love that Applebee's let's you build your own bar snack/appetizer combos!!! I did a pick three and got chicken wonton tacos, kobe style meatballs and potstickers. None of which disappointed!!!! Not only were they delicious but they look exactly the way they do in the pictures!!! The new electronic devices at the table that allow you to order more, call your server, pay your bill, etc...these are genius!!! Great company, great meal, great service."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped for lunch. I was happy with my meal, but he said he was not that happy with his. I had the chicken with the shrimp topper which was delish except the broccoli was a little to cooked for me, however it was eatable. Hubby had fried fish and chips which he thought was not flakey like it's supposed to be but eatable. The service was great, we enjoyed Aurelia and her smile was contagious. We have eaten at this restaurant several times and has always had great service and even though some things might not be perfect we will go back to have another lunch or two.  Hope this restaurant is not on the list of closings."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not great. And felt like i was being rushed out..."}
{"text":"We went here for a late dinner. It wasn't very crowded. We ordered a appetizer platter to share. The food was ok. They have a guy playing live music on Monday nights. The music wasn't bad but the jokes were. We were sitting at a table behind the guy but I think his base was too high or something. Our ears were vibrating. Also, he announced he takes requests and a girl brought him a note with some songs to play. He said he didn't know any of them except one by the eagles. He refused to play that one but would play another song by them. Good idea to have live music. Suggestion: get someone who knows more songs and turn down the base!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house so we go there sometimes when we don't want to cook. This time it was Friday at lunchtime. They were pretty busy. We ordered the pick two lunch combos. I got a Caesar salad with 1/2 of a clubhouse grill. My husband got the same but with tomato soup. The good was delicious. The only problem was that my husband had a piece of waxed paper in his sandwich. You know... The kind that go in between cheese slices when you buy it. The Server apologized and we laughed. She brought him another. It bothered us a bit that  the manager didn't come over and it would have been kind of nice to have a bit deducted off of his meal but that did not happen. We are not high maintenance picky people by any means. It just would have been nice to show a little bit better customer service there."}
{"text":"Typically Applebees is a safe, generic choice for a simple meal when you're hungry.  Their brand of American food can be a nice filler when food quality and taste are only secondary to your hunger.  I'd say that for lack of a truly tasty meal, the one redeeming quality is (usually) the service.  However, this was definitely not the case for the Gibsonia store.    Upon arriving we were greeted in a friendly manner by two lovely hostesses who showed us to our table and gave us our menus.  It pretty much all went downhill from there.  After a few minutes, our waiter came by and without introducing himself, asked us what we'd like to drink.  He looked confused and his speech sounded as if he were mumbling, but we thought nothing of it.  He quickly brought us our drinks and we placed our orders which consisted of two salads and two appetizers we were going to share as our meal.  The one thing we did ask was that the salads be brought out at the same time as the rest of our food (which is not usually a problem.).  Several minutes later, one of the food runners brought us one salad.  When we informed her that we had in fact ordered two salads to be brought with our food, she went back to let the waiter know about his error.  Minutes and minutes passed  by and eventually we were brought salad #2 (still no food by the way.)     Several more minutes passed by and I was starting to suspect that our waiter  wasn't just confused or uncomfortable - he was high!   The guy was slurring his speech and was so glassy eyed that he couldn't even focus.  He alternated staring at his notebook and the computer screens for well over 10 minutes as if he were trying to decipher some ancient hieroglyphics.  Finally, after I'd had enough I summoned a manager to our table and explained to him that there was something wrong with his waiter.  I told him about or food situation and the fact that over 1/2 an hour had passed with no sign of our two appetizers.  The manager half-hardheartedly apologized and made an excuse that his waiter had an ear infection, was being sent home and promised our food would be right out.  Fifteen minutes later, the waiter was STILL standing at the computer looking confused and we STILL had no food.   After almost an hour of dealing with wretched service, we finally decided enough was enough and left.    Wendy's was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice enough   Food was absolutely horrible    Bacon was barely cooked  Food was served Luke warm at best. Manager came to see if we were doing alright all we asked for was a ranch 10 minutes later no ranch and the waitress finally showed but and she came back with it right away.   Shrimp was underdone    Needless to say we will not be going back ever again."}
{"text":"I went here specifically for their lunch specials awhile back and we sat down 30 minutes before their lunch period was over and ordered my usual soup and salad combo.  The food was fine and I tried to order a second round and the server tells me that she can't let me order it because the lunch period had passed.  Um, what?  If I had known that my order wouldn't be honored after 3pm when I first sat down, i wouldn't had gone. The server absolutely knew why I even came in in the first place and didn't bother telling me.   I was still hungry at that point but I refused to order any more food from them.    I was so disappointed with the experience that I wrote to corporate to explain what had happened.   To this day, I haven't heard from them.  I thought being served raw chicken from an earlier visit would teach me not to come back but I guess I was too forgiving.  I knew that this was a big chain restaurant and it was gonna suck so I have no one to blame but myself.   I haven't returned since and will never be back."}
{"text":"Yes. It's a chain restaurant and it's average. The service was fairly good and the cajun steak I ordered was definitely satisfactory."}
{"text":"This place is sort of your standard fare for chain restaurants. The food and drink I ordered were just below average. The alcoholic drink I had tasted very watered down. The service was nice enough though."}
{"text":"Come on Monday after 5pm for cheap delicious burgers. Have any issues ask for matty, he'll take care of you. Great staff, everyone is friendly yet professional. Try the loaded mash potatoes, excellent."}
{"text":"I recently returned to have a lite dinner with my friend after a year plus hiatus, well let me say I should have returned sooner! The new menu is well worth any amount of waiting time. I've since returned (apx 4 days later) for lunch, and was also pleasantly surprised. The new menu provides diverse options from grilled salmon, shrimp Thai salad, to lamb and and more. All plated wonderfully to please the eye, and the flavors didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"The hostess Victoria wasn't very hospitable and was agitated when I ask her for a specific servers section. She was actually down right rude. I ask to speak with a manager 30 minutes later no manager and every time she walked by my table she had a nasty little smirk. The manager never came to the table he actually walked by several times and ask the tables around us how they were. It was very purposeful. I'm reminded why I don't eat at garbage restaurants. Pathetic. Unfortunately this is what you can expect to get in Goodyear after 10pm. Never Again!"}
{"text":"After being in the restaurant for 20+ years not much surprises me but this had to have been one of the worst experiences ever.  When we got to the restaurant it started with a great greet by a host who could be explained as a seater.  I thought it was amazing that the seater greeted us until the main host got back to the front.  It was busy so I thought this was a great show of team work.  The host was great.  She brought us to the table an even told us who our server and the manager on duty was.  I thought it was a great touch.  It was down hill from here.  The server came to the table and mumbled her name, could barely hear her.  We order soup and app for our daughter and 2 items for my wife and I.  We told the server repeatedly to bring the soup with my daughters cheese sticks as an entree so she could eat with us.  She did not.  The soup came out first and the French onion was a hot mess.  The cheese was clumpy and you could not find the bread.  My daughters cheese sticks came out finally and my wife and I waited over 30 minutes for our food.  Thankfully our daughter was able to eat.  When it came out the cheese looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp, that coagulated look, and it was cold.  We sent ours back and then a few minutes later they did the unspeakable in our business.  They brought our old food back out to the table for us.  Why didn't they throw it out!!!  An older manager had already come out and said that out food would come out hot.  Nope,  it came out dead!!  We told the person who ran out the dead food that it was the same food and she said \"I don't know I am not your server.\"  Our server came out and they began to argue at the table about the dead food.  The server took it away knowing they made a mistake and they finally got our food out.  The second time it was good but over 45 minutes after we got there.  The second manager came out and apologized.  Then we waited 15 minutes for the check so they could \"do something for is\" as the server explained as she was walking by our table,  kind if like a drive by.  The entire experience was rediculous and unprofessional.  I can't imagine running my restaurant this way or my wife working at hers like this.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Waiter was nice and polite. Food was amazing and delicious. Prices were good and everything was clean. Food was brought out to us in perfect amount of time."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Applebee's when I lived in Winnipeg. It was a ten-minute drive from where I lived.  Since I returned to Markham, the closest Applebee's is in Ajax. I choose to backroad getting there, which takes me half an hour.  I have been to this location twice. The first time was probably a good decade ago. I couldn't tell you how I felt about my food experience then, but I do remember the person that I was with!  Last weekend, my dear friend and I met to exchange Christmas presents early and to shop at the box stores. After we were done, I suggested Applebee's for dinner. She was game.  She is vegan. We sat in my car and I looked up the menu. There was a portobello mushroom burger. Sold!  I love mushrooms, especially portobello. This burger isn't a full portobello as the patty. Rather, it's a veggie burger topped with slices of portobello. It was still fabulous.  You can substitute any burger for a veggie burger. My friend did that with the barbeque burger. She had sweet potato fries as her side. I chose mac and cheese as my side.  The veggie burger was flavourful and moist. Thank goodness it didn't taste like cardboard! My friend was happy with her burger and sweet potato fries. I enjoyed my mac and cheese. It was the perfect size and portion.  We were both stuffed that we had to say no to dessert. I couldn't even try to shovel down the brownie bite. My favourite is the maple nut blondie with pecans and vanilla ice cream. I am drooling just thinking about how yummy this dessert is on a hot, sizzling plate.  It was snowing heavily that evening, so we had an enjoyable, quiet time chatting as we ate. Unfortunately, some jerk decided to smoke in the women's washroom, so it smelled like an ashtray when I stopped by.  I recommend coming to this restaurant.The food is delicious and staff are incredibly nice.  Although this next detail has nothing to do with the restaurant, a customer came over to my car as I was clearing the snow off my car with my brush. He asked if he could use it. I said that I would lend it to him once I was done with it. A minute later, I was done. He thanked me and went to his car to brush off the snow. He then came back and thanked me again.  Just a public service that we live in Canada and we should always have a snow brush when it's Winter!  (244)"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Great place to go for the lunch hour if you want to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheeseburger medium well and got it rare with blood on the plate and soaked into the bun, I asked for them to take it back and correct it and got it back real fast as if it was just microwaved. They did not even make a brand new one. I had cut it in half and got the same one back on a new bun. Manager was just hanging out with current and ex employees who we're being loud and obnoxious burping and yelling.The glassware was dirty as well. I won't ever come back to this one."}
{"text":"Food is usually always amazing and cooked to perfection when we come here...this would have been 4 stars but, our waitress was too busy serving her friends at the bar...we waited another 15 minutes for our check when we were ready to go and not once did she come by to ask if we needed a refill on our drinks...very disappointing service today...not sure I will be back to this location"}
{"text":"Came in with my family of 4 on a very non-busy Sunday afternoon.  Waited 15 minutes...never greeted by a server.  Let the front entrance person who sat us know...and still never greeted.  We ended up simply walking out. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Even if we had a gift card again I would not eat here!  Our fries were covered in salt and tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for ages. Our server did not stop by the table to see how we were doing but you could see and hear all the staff going in the kitchen to hang out.  The manager looked like he was hungover and wearing the previous days clothes.  The cleanliness of the restaurant was awful.  You could see dust build up on everything the floors look disgusting."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience! I came in for lunch with my 8 month old daughter and we were instantly seated, our waiter Rob was extremely attentive to us! Came back multiple time to check if we needed anything else. He went above and beyond to service us! Very knowledgable about the dishes (even the new ones). Food was delicious and I left very satisfied. Defiantly will be bringing the rest of my family in."}
{"text":"Fair. Burger was over done and they were out of pickles. Wait time was short, food was ok at best. Server was ok."}
{"text":"For being extremely busy the staff was extremely good at communicating wait times and apology for having new staff. Hey everyone has a first day and they did great. I am always greeted with a smile.  We can always count on Applebees for a good time"}
{"text":"I usually never complain about food... I was raised to be polite but God save us all.. The food was an afront to humanity.... It made me lose faith completely in the human race... I love food. All food. But good god. Knowing food that horrible exists has sent me into a deep depression.. I am a law abiding citizen but  the depression will set in .. I will self medicate . Ill Probably start drinking first, with in a year smoke meth. Get caught after the end of a high speed chase on national news with an unconscious hooker in my front seat. Lose everything go to rehab . In rehab ill see a psychiatrist who will get to the trigger or root of my downward spiral. And they will discover it was your horrible food. Thank you applebees for destroying my promising future with your watery ass alfredo and rubberized $18.00 steak.. Waitress was nice .. Wasnt her fault."}
{"text":"Service was good very friendly. Ordered the all day brunch burger the first egg was raw and when I asked for a new one it was well done. The hash browns listed as \"crispy\" were far from it. Normally have good food here not sure if it's the cook or just too busy for good service."}
{"text":"This Applebee's is pretty sad. Sad in an Emo sort of way? Well yes on the one occasion I saw the hostess crying. Sad on super slow service? Yes, that too. Our server took our drink order and wandered off. About 10 minutes later we see our drinks pop up at the bar. There we sat, admiring them from afar. Our server was nowhere to be found. About 10 minutes later she comes up, grabs the drinks and sets them back down. Then she proceeds to yell at the bartender. Finally our drinks meet our table and we put our order in.  Our food came about 25 minutes later delivered by another server. Who knows where our server was. We ate our food which is bland and ok, nothing remarkable. After another 20 minutes a different server brings our bill. She mentions something about our server being on a break but she can't find her. Ummmm.....she's been on break the entire time we've been there.   The only thing worth while was their shrimp spinach salad which they've removed from the menu. Avoid this particular restaurant, it's bad."}
{"text":"Is bad experience last night , the steak is so bad and theservice is bad  waiters name merianda , and i been eat for that location for 3 year and last night is the worst experience"}
{"text":"How hard is it to get an order right? Is it possible to get a food order served on a plate commensurate in size to the food being plated? If you are notified that the food delivered is wrong, is it too much to expect an apology, and not hear \"I've never actually looked at the menu\" (sly look, wink, wink, nod nod...like it's some funny inside joke). There's a reason I've not been to an Applebee's for years...nice to see that some things just never change. The food was passable, my rack of ribs jammed onto a too small rectangular plate with broccoli and the wrong kind of fries (ordered the garlic fries, not plain), the waitress displayed not a care that the fries were wrong, and quite frankly I don't do lemme fix it - get it right the first time...that is your job. Corporate culture, staff training...fail."}
{"text":"They have a regular crew of servers . if you frequent here enough , you recognize them and they recognize you. They never have a problem anytime i make a special request. When this location is good , its the best. If you catch them on an off night , its a nightmare. Never seem to get my steak cooked right but my foances ribs/shrimp are always good. Love the bartender at this location!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since 2008 when we moved to the area.  It's a good place to relax, have some nice food & drink. The staff has always been very nice & attentive. Food has been consistently good. We enjoy trying new & different places but regularly come here a couple times a month. Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos are my favorite appetizer. Clean, nice atmosphere and a cool juke box you can play from your cellphone."}
{"text":"It was way too cold in there  it's so cold my poor girlfriend was freezing her butt off we had to wait quite awhile for the server to ask us what we wanted then she was more preoccupied with other things than us. all in all the service  was poor to me and the food was overpriced"}
{"text":"A little bit of a wait but was worth every minute. The waiter is very friendly. I made a mistake on my order and they fixed it right away. I offered to pay for it and they insisted that I didn't have to. I must say I will be back again. I've been here many of tines but I forget to check in and leave a post. Well this time they earned it and want to say thank you for your professional crew. I will come back with my family again."}
{"text":"great service and  really nice people good place to go when you want to get off  the fast pace of the Vegas strip restaurants"}
{"text":"Amazing service. A big thank you to Kenny our waiter. He was on top of our orders and our drinks. Next time I am in Surprise Arizona I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Gonzalez / Clarkson's enjoying late night dinner at Applebee's....  Way good.   Food perfect, waitress excellent, great night."}
{"text":"This is the second time at this location, and waited too long to return.  As with other reviewers, service is friendly and outstanding.  The meals are delicious and priced fairly."}
{"text":"Place tables & floors are never cleaned before seating, menus are dirty. Place is loud, Peppered steak over quinoa was bad, it had a bad tastes, tomatoes were bad, & spinach & rice, do not order"}
{"text":"Awful place, dirty on floors & does not clean tables, glasses and utensils are dirty, food not cooked all the way"}
{"text":"If i could give no stars i would food was cold when it came out asked for med steak got over done tough something cold potatoes they said cheese and bacon yuck and cold mac and cheese wont be back to this location chef needs to go back to school"}
{"text":"My experience of Applebee's before its opening in Calgary was strictly related through Talladega Nights, and an actual taste of the food reinforced the stereotype the movie perpetrated: BLAND. As my wife said, \"this is white people food\". No wonder America is so fat! You could certainly do worse, but also infinitely better."}
{"text":"Guys Applebee's is just gross. Sure, they have good happy hour deals. But the drinks are all sugar mixes and the food is sooooo subpar and somehow an entire tray of deep fried food was cold. I really didn't see a point in complaining though, I could tell this was the norm. Only not giving one star because our server was nice."}
{"text":"Uhh who's leaving terrible reviews at Applebee's? Most of these stars are for their drinks and wonton tacos. At one point of time we frequented their Carside to Go so much that we didn't have Tupperware we had Applebee's containers. The staff here are friendly and accommodating and this is the perfect spot to watch the game or go to happy hour. I love their 2 for $20 deal and I can only count on one hand when I had an unpleasant experience.  They take care of it quickly. They care and that's why I always come back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to hang out with family and friends. I mostly come for the sincere service and the crazy karaoke nights. But I just found out last weekend there isn't anymore Karaoke by the wonderful host Stew. They are in need of someone ASAP. My father in law is a big fan of singing every Saturday but that won't keep us out. It's kid friendly and even a nice girls night out. This location does get a little busy I did notice that the soap was out and they didn't have papertowels but that just shows how popular this place is and one of the waitresses got to it right away.  I love that 2 for $20 and $24 can't believe it even includes an appetizer. This time I treated myself to their shrimp plate and picked my favorite sides of a perfect portioned fruit bowl and a warm scoop of mashed potatoes. I thought I'd actually get to have leftovers but I devoured the whole meal and had a little of everyone else's mouth watering meals. Having a group of people around definitely benefits you because each meal gets better and better. Too bad we were all too full for all their delicious desserts I'll definitely be back for that Maple Butter Blondie"}
{"text":"We just love this Applebee's location!! The food is always fast, hot and delicious and the service is always great.. If you can't get a table.. Sit at the bar.. Our favorite bartender is Megen aka megsta! She makes the best perfect margarita !"}
{"text":"We got quickly seated and a server ordered our drinks. So far so good. When the drink came, I was disgusted to see my straw without the paper. I am pretty cautious when it comes to my food and that didn't seem very cool to me. I don't know if the server may possibly have placed her hands all over my straw where my mouth is going to go or what. I asked for a additional straw when the server went by, and she gave me such a confused look, like why I needed another straw.  She came back with the straw in her hand lacking the paper again and a napkin wrapped around one end of it. I couldn't believe it.. I just set it on the table and forgot about even drinking my beverage.  Perchance the straws come without paper on them, but they really have to change that because it isn't going to bring me back just on account of that.   They had great deals on food and was just in my price range.   The pasta I had, held no favor. I had to drench it with salt and that really didn't work any. It just wasn't a good meal, and I didn't even finish have of it.  I was thirsty and just desired to go grab a bottle of water somewhere. The server seen I didn't touch my beverage and didn't charge me for it. That was much appreciated"}
{"text":"We literally just left. I love eating at Applebee's, but come on. 5 min wait to get seated (no one else was waiting) sat us down. Waited 7min to order water, waited 9min to receive water and she didn't take our order? Ha! What a joke! We we're going to order then she ran off. Great. We couldn't order. We left."}
{"text":"Ok.    Bar service with Jay was good.   But my \"stir fry\" chicken was \"grilled\".    I can understand why this place doesn't have a good rating.  But then again I got stir-fry at Applebee's"}
{"text":"Oh My God, This place was a expierence that I will never forget ! I'm Sooo freakin' impressed by this Applebee's I never wanted to leave after I entered the door ! I went here 4 days almost in a row, the food killer, drinks the bomb, Happy Hour from 4-7 yesssss, can I get a high five? All the staff was good looking, no weirdo looking people.  Jenna, I will miss you the most, The best/hottest bartender ever ! talk about multi-tasking wow this woman does it all ! The second, third and fourth time I went in here I was greeted by my name from her, before I even sat down ! She also remembered my drinks and had one ready for me within a minute of me sitting down.  I wanna go back!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE. Do not go here. You're better off with fast food. It's cheaper and will taste better. Trust me."}
{"text":"Was hard to navigate the front door. Staff friendly. Prompt. All way enjoy their oriental Asian chicken salad. Close to home."}
{"text":"I love coming here for big family dinners they always have great big smiles when I walk in there and I always get the table I want I never sit where I don't want too the 2 for 20 is the best deal they have the food is always warm and delicious   !!!!   I love the servers there"}
{"text":"My family and I don't normally go to Applebee's and now i remember why.  We stopped in because we had some gift cards to use. It took our hostess 5 minutes to seat us in a less than 35% full restaurant. We asked for a booth and she said she had to wipe one down. Didn't seem busy to me, why were the tables not ready to begin with? There were more than half a dozen open booths.  She walked to the table and then walked to the other side of the restaurant to get a towel to wipe it down. Another family had come in and without greeting them she shouted \"I'll be right with you!\" She walked to the table wiped it down and walked all the way back to the front. She  proceeded to walk BACK to the table without waving us over or letting us know she was ready. The second family did not look over our way so out of confusion, because the hostess did not communicate, they thought that table was for them. We corrected the situation, since the hotness kept walking and not paying any attention. We got to the table and she only had 2 menus and 2 sets of utensils. We stated three in our party. She said I'll be back with another menu. I told the girl, we don't need another menu we can share but we do need another set of utensils. 5 minutes later she came back with them. Not very efficient start to lunch. I should have took the hint there and left.   By the time our waitress came over for our DRINK orders we had already decided on our food. When we got our food, I was less than impressed. The 4 cheese Mac with honey chicken was more like dry Mac and cheese. In the description I didn't read that there was bacon in it. I'm that person that doesn't like bacon. I get more cheese from Kraft. The \"salads\" were a portion for turtles. They werent even in a bowl but, a small sauce plate. The chicken was dry and flavorless. When we were over the meal, we tried the \"call server\" button on the little handy computer on the table, come to find out it just blinks red, and doesn't help when your waitress isn't on the floor to see it. We waited 5-10 minutes for her to come over and asked us if we wanted boxes, I said yes and the check. It took her a few minutes to come back but, she only came back with the boxes not the check. At this point we have been there over an hour and a half, not a good use of my time waiting more than half the time for a less than impressive meal. She finally came back with the check and we left. Yes we could have paid on the computer however we had a discount card to use as well as gift cards so we needed her to process that."}
{"text":"I used to love going to AppleBees but the last 3 times it's been a bit disappointing. Food quality is not the same. The only thing that seams to stay consistent is my favorite triple chocolate meltdown."}
{"text":"We were having a late Thanksgiving dinner and wanted to eat somewhere to hold us over until we ate. Thankfully this Applebee's was open. I had the Fish in Chips which wasn't too bad. The tarter sauce was a little too \"pickle-y\" for me. The french onion soup did not look like the photo but wasn't bad (lacked cheese). My girl went to town on their Treo Appetizer. We usually go to this location when in AZ, so no doubt we'd be back again."}
{"text":"We live 1/2 mile away, hadn't been there in a couple years, but close to the movies, so thought we'd give it another shot. OK for my wife, not good for me. It's a meat lovers festival, and while I'll get some chicken once in a while, I'm more vegetarian when out, like Saturday night.  They don't have a vegetarian section at all on the menu, and when asked, the server said the could \"substitute a soy burger for any of our other burgers\". \"We only get a request once in a while and tell tell them we have a soy thing.\" Really? What a poor answer for someone who really wanted a true veg offering. 3 of the 5 burgers had bacon on them, and the other 2 just aren't what you'd serve on a veg burger. This guy didn't even know what kind of a burger it was, and didn't even go ask. Boca? Black Bean?  No clue.  He just laughed about everything.  I ordered it anyways as a veg patty with cheddar, lettuce and tomato. What a joke.  The burger was dry with hard edges, served with 2 small end cuts of tomato that didn't even cover the patty, a piece of lettuce, one ring of onion (which I didn't ask for nor want), one small piece of dill pickle, which I also didn't ask for. The fries were OK, but I could taste that either they were deep fry in beef grease, or they had fried some kind of meat in it, since the fries has a meat undertone. I was very disappointed.  Off flavor.  When a server can't even tell you what kind of burger it was, and didn't go ask, I took it as an insult that vegetarians aren't respected very much, and this give didn't care. He joked in his Jacksonville, Florida, southern accent like he'd good 'ol boy his way through the meal. Sorry dude, laughing and joking just shows why you don't take your job seriously. I was close to speaking to their manager about their menu.  This guy was all over us before ordering and while eating, but when it was clear we were almost done and weren't ordering dessert, he was hard to get back. He was in it for the orders. Took almost 10 minutes just to get the bill. Once we got him and told him we were headed to a movie, he jumped and got our bill fast.  Speaking of Vegetarian Offerings...Even all but 1 of their salads had chicken on them. What the??  With so much health consciousness going on, why don't they get on board with offering true vegetarian offerings.    Sorry, it will be a cold day before I go into another Applebee's unless I see some serious respect for the vegetarians who are typically larger spenders and tippers. I'll vote with my money elsewhere.  By the way....my wife's riblets were alright, good portion, but were covered with so much sauce, made her wonder why. Sauces cover a lot of sins of a kitchen."}
{"text":"When i was paying for my food in the kiosk it sets a tip amount wont let you lower your tip only increase it...  so had to have server  pay for my food.  I wont go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first Applebee's I ever went to back when I was in my high teens or low 20's. The upbeat commercials were enough to draw me in. Today, as an older and much more cynical man, I'd probably snicker at them and at my younger self for wanting to hit-up an Applebee's so much, and yes with Applebee's it can depend upon the location and what you order. They're also a chain, which makes them difficult for critical eaters to like, but the dinner I had at this location was too hard not to enjoy.   The Brew Pub Pretzels and Beer Cheese Dip were as delectable as any appetizer I've had at any independent restaurant. The flaky chew of the pretzels themselves were akin to a baguette merged with a churro, and come to think of it, they would have made for a dream of a dessert if paired with sugar or a glaze or hot fudge. In this case, however, they came with a dreary beer cheese dip (think of glue) and a honey mustard that was tasty enough in a sweet-vs-bitter way to allow me to ignore the former.   My \"pink inside\" Quesadilla Burger may come off as blasphemic to some, but damn when that grilled tortilla cracks under the pressure of your teeth and sinks through the juicy beef, radioactive orange Mexi-ranch, pico de gallo, diced onions, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, bacon bits, jack, and cheddar, you realize that you're just eating a new, groovy kind of taco.   Kay ordered from the Take Two Seasonal Menu and found salvation in her Lemon Shrimp Fettucine as did I when I finished the remnants of it, morsels that were much more flavorful than should be allowed at a chain.   Dessert was the brownie sundae's polar, Earth-2 opposite in the Butter Pecan Blondie. Sizzling like a concert with pyrotechnics, it came on a broiling, cast-iron skillet as a dripping vanilla ice cream, a cream cheese sauce, and glazed pecans hung on for dear life. One of those dishes that turns heads and induces envy in others, I relished its honey-smacked notes and dense texture.   Jaime, our server, was a hoot, and chatted with us famously as we dined overlooking Cochran Road. Not minding my unkempt appearance (it was a long day at the mine), the manager held the door for us as we left, assuaging our guilt over eating out on a weeknight. \"Eh, what the heck?\" he said to us. \"You look like you deserved a treat.\"   P.S. Behind us sat a party of 3 that we didn't actually see until we left: 2 adolescent girls and an erudite middle-aged man with a rich, baritone, radio-ready, and familiar voice. As we walked out the door, I finally saw the man in question: It was none other than Pittsburgh Steelers legend Rocky Bleier enjoying dinner with his young, adopted daughters. Reportedly, he's a Mt. Lebanon resident, so come. You too may have a brush with fame!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for this Applebee's as much. The service was acceptable, but as I said in my review of the Greentree location, it often depends on where you go and what you order.   I can't remember why exactly we were out this way, but Kay was payin' (!), so I didn't fuss a heckuva lot. When she insisted we order from the 2 for $20 menu, my appetite deflated a bit.   Gosh, those riblets are bizarre and unpleasantly challenging to eat. Being that each piece is a bone chip with some sauced pork on it, I was reminded of the infamous banquet scene in the film \"King Solomon's Mines\" during which a man could be seen scraping meat from the shell of a beetle with his teeth.   The french fries, however, were toasty, crispy, and adequate.   I tend to avoid dessert shooters and warm lava cakes out of ennui for them, and milkshakes usually prove to be overly filling for me, so I went with the Blue Ribbon Brownie. It proved to be a smoldering celebration of nearly flourless chocolate decadence drizzled with hot fudge, studded with nuts, and accompanied by a dome of vanilla ice cream to keep the affair from getting out of hand. I am addicted to these types of sundaes, and Applebee's makes a dandy version.   When Applebee's is at its best, you are made to forget that you're eating at a franchise. This Applebee's will leave a post-it note on the windshield of your car stating \"We have 19 locations in and around your metro area!\""}
{"text":"Hard to believe an Applebee's in American can\"t find anything else to blast except Spanish music"}
{"text":"The kids meal for my son was disgusting... Cheese pizza ..NOT ... Tasted terrible and was burnt ... French fries loaded with pepper ... Because kids love pepper? Seriously ?! Will NOT go back . My food was ok - soup and salad , we also had to wait a long time to be seated as the only people waiting and no hostess to be found"}
{"text":"I come here from time to time. Service is always great and the food is good. If you are in the neighborhood and need to have a working lunch that is the place. Service is quick food is hot and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"The night started off good, our waitress was nice, things were going well. It seemed like this applebees was short staffed this particular night. Our waitress began to give us terrible service plus the food was not good at all. We had to ask for boxes to take come food about 4 times and for refills. The good was awful and so was the service."}
{"text":"The dessert drink are really good with the chocolate melt down chocolate for under 15 dollar, really what else can u ask for? Lol"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night and had to wait an hour and a half. This will be the last time I go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is the worst. I like Apple Bees but not at this location. Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and was advised there would be a 15 min wait. Understandable for a Sunday. Our 15 min wait turned into only a few mins. Our waiter Jessica was awesome! She not only knew the menu but she seemed to know us as well. She knew what meals would best suit us and when I ordered the Club sandwich she knew how I wanted it before I could even tell her. She returned to the table many times to make sure we were not only happy with our service but to make sure we didn't need anything else. She refilled our drinks even before they became completely empty and she even made sure we were happy with the flavor. When it came time for dessert she not only gave her opinion on items but told us what were the best sellers.   Service was exceptional and our waiter was even better!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was instantly welcomed by the hostess Alesia, our server Susan, and Kelly were exceptionally nice and hospitable with the service at this location. This is my second eating at an Applebee's restaurant since I've resided in Vegas. Will definitely return to this location again."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review but my experience here with my family more than once has been horrible! We live externally close to this location yet every time we come for dinner the service we receive is terrible. Megan was our server and John to my understanding is the manager and during our entire dinner we were checked on one time and IT WAS NOT EVEN BUSY. They were too busy having personal conversations behind the bar. I ordered a drink and NEVER received it! If we wanted something to go along with our food we had to make the attempt to track down a server. This was not how we wanted to spend our dinner and I highly advise you and your family to go else where and spend your money at a restaurant that appreciates your business. Next time we will travel the distance to a different location and refuse to ever come back here!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Ordered a cobbler salad and waiter Jeff says we don't have cobbler salad, he didn't even suggest it's wedge salad, just looked at me like I'm stupid! I hope he don't mess up my order!"}
{"text":"One place I can always count on good tasting food and enough to take home for later. No complaints. My favorite location."}
{"text":"My wife and I though we would give this place a try.. typically we are more for Chili's but figured we would shake it up a bit. The restaurant was clean which is always a plus but the customer experience was definatly lacking. My wife had ordered some salad which in the description didn't say anything about being spicy whick she doest do spicy at all so she didn't eat much..I ordered a burger that had an egg on it I was looking forward to the egg but when it came the egg was fried solid total bummer... The whole point of putting an egg on your burger is the nice warm yolk...  Definatly dropped the ball.. of you are reading this do your self a favor and go to the chili's on the other side of the street!!"}
{"text":"Really great spot. The babe and I were craving some food and didn't want much to eat. So we thought applebees would have a few options. Keep in mind it's 45min before closing. The server (Nikki) was very friendly and helped us find the perfect options. We ended up getting French Onion soup and I got a side of quinoa, rice, and cranberries, I think I tasted some kind of nut flavor. We also got chocolate Oreo everything. The shake was superb and she even added extra Oreos for me. Then the Oreo fudge thing. Haha delicious. All in all. Great service, good food, ambiance is welcoming. Would recommend it."}
{"text":"Best days and time to come is mon-thu before 3pm. Service is better during the day, less crowded and better food portions."}
{"text":"I ordered the french onion soup, 12oz strip steak med-rare with mushrooms/onions and extra broccoli.  The steak was almost flavorless, the broccoli was waaay overcooked and yet somehow served cold, and the french onion soup tasted like beef bullion with extra salt.  I had a 25$ giftcard so I paid $1.62 and I still feel ripped off.  When my son brings home those flyers from school where applebees donates a percentage of your bill to the school... I'm going to give his teacher 10$ and stay home for dinner."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while so was expecting the old Applebee's menu. The food was mediocre and overpriced. The food came out about 40 minutes after ordering and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The waitress apologized saying the kitchen was having problems and offered to bring more napkins for the inconvenience....  Many napkins later we had finished our meals and we're ready to go. The only prompt service was bringing the debit machine over to ensure we got out quick enough to seat more guests."}
{"text":"The food was okay. 3 stars. It's the service my family and I received is why I'm giving this 5 stars. Our server was Salem and she was amazing! I ordered a pasta dish wth shrimp that I had the kitchen add real cheese to. They did it, I liked it. Anyway Salem rocked, thank you."}
{"text":"Come on, Applebee's. I have given you so many chances. I recently took people at work here. They overcooked 2 steaks! The burger came 10 minutes after our steaks because they had to make it again since it was made way before the steaks. SMH. The broccoli was old. See my picture.   What is going on with this place? I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"The manager Sahar was really attentive and nice. Our server Missi was wonderful and knowledgeable . Because of these two I'll be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Gross! Dirty! Horrible service! We came here because we had a gift card, but will not come back. The food was awful and tasted like it came from a microwave. The service was mediocre. And don't get me started on the women's bathroom. Absolutely less than 1 star."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the gay Applebees I poop funny afterward.  I've only gone here for happy hour for the $2 tall domestic beers and the half price apps. I hadn't been in almost a year and sat down at the bar on a busy night and the bartender said \"hey man I haven't seen you in like a year.\" I thought that was pretty fucking cool seeing as I hadn't been more than 2-3 times ever.   The food is exactly what you would expect from an Applebees. It's trailer trash \"fancy night out\" food and great food for unsophisticated people. I am also amazed this location seems to be open till 1am on the weekends... probably because it is the gay applebee's.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I found the Applebee menu very appealing with a choice of a variety of foods.  They also have a carryout service and special parking.  The problem is they don't deliver and when you go there to pickup, they expect a tip.  Now a tip for what? They are not providing any customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on November 11th for Remembrance Day. Took my grandfather who is a WW2 Vet (all veterans get a free meal here on this day). I ordered the Buffalo Sauce Tossed Chicken Fingers with fries. The Chicken was decent and the fries were average. The portion  was very large and I left completely full. The experience was average but I don't see myself going back here until next November 11th."}
{"text":"I got ribs and chicken combo. Both so dry i fed them to my dog. The waitress was nice and attentive though."}
{"text":"Customer service is great. Car side to go food was horrible. I got the 4 cheese mac and cheese. Didnt even have any flavor, really wasnt any sauce on it. It tasted like i was eating plain noodles. And the piece of chicken they put on top was tiny."}
{"text":"Great service for lunch time! Our server/ bartender Lauren was amazing! Drinks were refilled and we didn't have to wait for anything! Upside to the drinks, they switched to glasses! I'm not a plastic lover, and I know that's petty. But it's something I think is great. We had the wonton tacos and Spinach dip app. Both were delicious, but I recommend the wonton tacos. I tried the new crispy chicken cornbread salad, it has a light dressing drizzle and was DELICIOUS! Not swimming in dressing, everything was portioned properly, and the salad was very filling! I'm definitely coming up more often and trying this summer menu!"}
{"text":"Not as bad as the rating and reviews say. Ok so we did have to ask for fresh bone in wings, the new ones were much better than the first ones we were served. Mozzarella sticks yummy. The cheeseburger was delicious, Wendy provided excellent service, the night manager was friendly and empathetic."}
{"text":"The food quality and taste has really gone down here. It used to be good. Our server Ivan was excellent. With so many other choices in the area I'll pass on this place. C-"}
{"text":"serously my son and I had the chipote steak, it was so salty I couildn't eat it.  yuk"}
{"text":"Our lunch was incredibly yummy.  Started off with green goddess wedge salad and then Napa chicken & portobellos under 550 calories (even tho it came with deep fried potatoes so that's pretty amazing)   Service was great and accomodated our requests for dressings and whatnot on the side.       Not sure what everyone is griping about, we had a great experience and with their new delicious & healthy menu, will definitely include Applebee's in our future dining :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Ben. The appetizers are always mighty tasty. Having a great delicious time worn family will definitely be back many more times. Thank you Ben for taking such great care of us."}
{"text":"Food was good. Great service. Mimi and Shelby did a great job satisfying me at Applebee's after hours"}
{"text":"First let me say that our server, Misty, rocked! She had our meal, as ordered, to us and refilled drinks along the way. While this is a chain, and a small Restraunt in the chain, they did well tonight, especially considering the mass of Veterans (thank you) being recognized for their service to our great country."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this was absolutely the worst Applebee's we have ever been to. I have no idea why corporate management would allow this location to stay in business. We walked in and waited approximate two minutes before being greeted by the hostess. This does not sound bad except the hostess was standing by the bar watching us walk in with no other guests..the look as if we had just interrupted a drug deal on the Las Vegas strip. There were 4 tables occupied. The chips on floor made me wonder if we had already missed a /the party. We quickly ordered and were very surprised at what came out of the kitchen compared to what the menus look like.....disappointment. The only reason we did not leave was because our waiter, did everything in his limited power to do whatever he could and we would have probably had to stay longer to find a manager....if one was even near. The hostess found her friend from another restaurant so she became out of commission.  This particular location is in a deserted mall area so maybe that has something to do with it, but at any rate we will not be returning to this location. We highly suggest going a mile or two in any direction for your dinner."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for a server. Then he only showed up after calling from device. Ten more minutes for drinks. We are leaving."}
{"text":"Ordered the all you can eat soup and salad. Pretty hard to make it worth it when it takes 20 minutes between refill orders. Waitress kept telling us that they were finishing up the soup. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"My hubby & I went to dinner here tonight and they messed everything up, my hubby got the wrong beer and then he ordered a steak medium snd it came so well done he couldn't eat it. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience. Rocky, the bartender, was such an amazing server. We recommend her every time.!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  There was a party of 12 of us.  The wait staff was friendly and courteous.  The food was very good.  I had their special of a strip steak with grilled Vidalia onions and a wedge salad.  The other had different dishes.  All of them were prepared well and came out hot.  We all agreed that this was a great experience and we will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Lauren S , Was our server, polite, courteous, and very attentive, great service, good food. What more can you ask for with a decent price like this? The burger and fries or cooked properly the tempura  onion rings were great."}
{"text":"A bunch of coworkers and I came here to celebrate two peoples last day at the office and this was the place everyone wanted to go.....   It was pretty clean, and the waitress was friendly.  However service was slow as heck!  Really does it take 15 minutes to bring out our drinks and almost 30 minutes to bring out one of my coworkers salad... mind you it wasn't even all that busy..  The food was okay, definitely not worth their cost, and my coworker had to return their coffee and get tea because it tasted like dirt.  Honestly it probably was.  Overall an average experience, nothing else really to complain about other then the unnecessary long wait."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give them any stars. We arrived about 7:30pm and it seemed to take for ever for our food to come out. Finally at almost 9pm our food, after I inquired to our waitress,  she said it was coming right up. I said what is the problem, she said they were busy, couldn't prove it by me. We were regulars at this Applebee's but we will never go back there. We ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp, it was so bad we couldn't even finish it. My husband kept putting catsup on the potatoes. We made a bad choice in food this time but the service was terrible. I finally went to the bar to inquire about our check so we could just get out of there.."}
{"text":"Horrible service tonight usually pretty good but not tonight. Food took 30min to get out and they weren't even busy. Asked for boneless wings and got traditional that tasted 8 days old. Not sure if its because its late they were trying to go home but regardless we WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!! This occurred 17JAN13 between approximately 2120-2215"}
{"text":"WOW. Walked in and waited for fifteen minutes and never got seated! ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Can't comprehend how that happens."}
{"text":"I go there most Friday nights with my husband.  We always sit at the bar.  Everyone is very friendly, and you never have to wait very long for your food or for drinks.  We take people when they come in for out of town, and they cannot believe how friendly all the waiters and bar staff are.  The downside, sometimes the welcome staff are not that friendly."}
{"text":"The server mike was really friendly, checked on us within good timing. The food was actually not bad, and was brought to us fresh. Overreal my time there was pretty nice filled with laughter and drinks. I had the peach sour drink and pasta papricotta."}
{"text":"On vacation I came to eat here since it is a familiar eatery for me and that was a mistake. As soon as I walked to the door I saw they had a $2 blue moon special so when the waitresses came to take my order I went to order it and she said it was no longer a special. So I pointed to the fact that is was on the specials board 20 feet away as well as on a sign as soon as you walk in so she said she would do it reluctantly. Not soon after the board was erased and the sign taken down. So the beers came and then the appetizers and it was an extremely long wait for the entrees. The food was not good at all! The ribs and chicken were all fat! Then I ordered a second beer and that when things quickly went down hill. I was sitting at the table next to the bar and watched as the bartender poured my beer with 1/4 beer and 3/4 head in it. I then timed as it sat for 14 mins dispersing the head and it was another 8 mins before the waitress brought it to me. Needless to say I requested another one because it was warm by the time it reached me. She returned it to the bartender who not realizing I was sitting right there told her that was ridiculous he had just poured it. The best part was they pretended they had \"comped\"me that beer that they messed up in the bill... Dont go to this Applebees!"}
{"text":"I go to Applebee's pretty often and get the simplest wedge salad there is to make (they don't even have to cut it up) my only request every time is to change the dressing that it comes with and every single time they bring me the wrong dressing, waited twenty minutes for a $5 salad for him to not even bring silverware, waited ten more minutes for that, waited fifteen more minutes to take the salad back and fix there mistake. I called up and explained to a manager how displeased I was for him to say I'll send you a ten dollar gift card in the mail for having to be so dissatisfied with the service and carelessness. NEVER EVEN RECEIVED that. will not returning. Ever."}
{"text":"Ummm, let me think about it.  No! No silverware, crappy service.   Food seemed to come out in shifts.  There was a 15 minute gap between the first dish and the last dish.  Would've been nice to all eat together."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place a chance... I really did. Between the lack of silverware, lackluster food, and the distracted waitress, I don't think I'll be back. I don't even want to waste anymore time even thinking about that visit by recounting it in this review.   They say we millennials are killing the restaurant business, well I say people work too hard for their money to be given mediocre service and bland food. Stay away!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years but in the last few months the service has gotten terrible. We have now stopped going."}
{"text":"Service was great as the hostess was friendly and sat me right away. The waiter was attentive and friendly. I ordered their new bone-in pork chop with a side of sweet mashed potatoes and garlic fries. The fries and mashed potatoes were great. The pork chop was on top of an apple sauce. It was ok, not great."}
{"text":"The average 2 star rating is right for this place. The original fries brought out were stale as was the side of Spanish rice with order of green chile steak enchiladas. The sauce on the enchiladas tasted like it came from a can. The waitress also forgot to bring my fries out and when she brought them out forgot about the side of ranch. My girl liked her grilled salmon with her sides."}
{"text":"love the choices here. love the pub preztels sticks"}
{"text":"don't know if our waitress was new or just not that good. took over 10 mins just for her to come over and take our drink order. then we got  our food before we got  our appetizers which were the pub pretzels stick even after asking where they were. then when she brings them she said she would tell her manger about that. then came back and said her manger will come over and talk to us which never happened. so we paid and left . wont be going back there for awhile. shame we never had a bad time there until now"}
{"text":"There was a cockroach near our table. They took forever to move us and move the roach. The restaurant is dirty and smells like feet. I was unhappy with our service as well. Very slow."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly and courteous. Food is very flavorful. I love the Bar atmosphere, bartenders especially Samantha who is funny, knows how to promote the bar and menu. It's like Cheers where everyone knows your name. Our new hangout place. The management is great and love how they really care. THANK YOU Applebee's for working so hard to be one of the best."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff. Love the food. The Bar area is a lot of fun. It's a great hangout place.. it's where everybody knows your name. Manager Samantha and her staff are incredible. If I can give it 10 stars, I would"}
{"text":"Shout out to our server Cameron AKA \"Cam Cam\" he was one of the best servers that we've had in awhile!!! Thank you so much for everything. Oh yeah, the food was great too."}
{"text":"Went to Applebee's for a bite Sunday night. The music was loud and... interesting. Not quite like the Applebee's I'm used to. We decided to get an appetizer sampler (2 smaller portions for $10) with the Brew Pub Pretzels & Beer Cheese Dip and Mozzarella Sticks. My boyfriend also got a Maple Bacon Chicken Piadini (no lettuce and the maple mustard on the side, in case I wanted to share). Took a little while to get our food. I was afraid the appetizers would come out cold, but they were actually warm and my b/f's wrap and fries were basically room temperature. There were 2 long, skinny pretzels and 4 mozz stix. The wrap wasn't bad with some of the leftover marinara and cheese dip. We ordered dessert via the tabletop kiosk. We got 2 Dessert Shooters as well as the new Churro S'mores, which looked too interesting not to try. The churros were very skinny and should have been warmer. I liked the toasted marshmallows but was disappointed in the chocolate underneath. It was just chocolate syrup, not actual melted chocolate, and it wasn't even warm. Not my favorite. My Strawberry Cheesecake Shooter was decent and my b/f's Chocolate Mousse Shooter was very thick and rich. Our server was alright... he seemed a bit overwhelmed, even though it wasn't that busy. The pay function on the kiosk was disabled... What a gyp! Applebee's left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"They service is wack !!! Food was over and under cooked . The drink was good tho food had potential to be good. I think they need new staff"}
{"text":"Worst steak I have ever had for $17.99!  It came with shrimp that was rubbery and cold. Such a big waste of money!!!  Server was great but lousy food!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and dry flavorless food. Waited 20min before someone asked us if we were ready to take our order. Then another 10min before the lady came back and said \"oh I didn't realize he didn't take your drink order\" as she nods to a guy behind her. Waited another 25min before the food came out and asked 2 times for my BBQ sauce. Then watched as the waiter passed me numerous time chatting with co workers and the table next to us. Then he asks me what was it I wanted again. Food came out and it was super dry and flavorless. Also waited another 20min to get our check so we could pay our bill after asking for it. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Food is microwaveable decent. Don't use mouthwash and go in because they will tell you are drunk. The English prick 2 years short of his GED, jerking it to boneless sesame seed wings was excited to take his management colored button up and tell us no.#allordersmatrer #mysisterhasthatheadband"}
{"text":"Just to start the food was decent. Can't complain too much. Now that that's outta the way here comes all the bad. This location is ridiculous! The staff is very inattentive because you'll order I've tea but they won't bring you any sugar and when you finally catch them and ask for sugar they bring you a small tray full of sweet and low only. Not sugar. Next, the music. We're talking full on norte√±as and duranguense music. To clarify, I am of Latin origin, my family is from Mexico more specifically so I would know what that type of music is or even what is sounds like. And I was born here In Phoenix mind you. HOWEVER.. The other 50 people in the building probably don't share my same ethnic background much less know what is being said in these songs that are blasting and blaring! I would expect this from macayos but not Applebee's. Overall very unimpressed or even comfortable with the atmosphere. So the only thing that was ok was the food. Just ok though. Anyway if your like me and want a good experience from a family restaurant I'd rethink this place. Just saying."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the ladies at work. Being gluten free I was hesitant and havent been to an Applebee's for a while but I looked at the allergen info prior to ordering and decided on the riblets with fries because they specifically said they did not contain wheat. The sauce on the ribs was also without wheat. The meal was okay, the lemonade was probably the highlight of my lunch. But about an hour after eating I felt bloated and knew I'd been glutened. I did notice the disclaimers about them not guaranteeing gluten free items so it was clearly my mistake for not asking more questions. I should have stuck with a salad or something not fried as the fries are likely fried in the same fryer with breaded items. Having said that my coworkers enjoyed their lunches and a couple raved about the tortilla soup. Our meal was delivered promptly. The server was Patricia who was attentive and competently handled our group of 6. The only reason I probably won't go back to an Applebee's is strictly the gluten issue and is not a reflection of the establishment."}
{"text":"This was only an OK. Our food came out to us 30 mins after we ordered it, which is not bad, but the French fries were beyond cold when the got to us. Then when we ordered more, it took another 20 mins to get a refill on them. And since when did the sweet chili sauce for your fries become a premium sauce, it was always just a regular sauce. Ill be back because this is my favorite restaurant, but this experience was only ok."}
{"text":"Took our family out to lunch, it was very busy, but we were seated right away. Our waitress was Brittney and she was really nice and did a good job balancing all her tables. That's why I gave them 3 stars..only because she was a really friendly young lady.  We should have known after the appetizers came cold and dry, but we thought it would get better..wrong..lol..the food was horrible. Steak overcooked, noodles sticky and cold, chicken strips were all breading and overcooked..  Also the other workers there would not help us, they told us to wait for our server when we asked for a water and we asked the same employee 3 times for silverware..  We will not be going back to this location.. $120 check for 1 good server, 4 hosts n bussers who hate their jobs and awful food???  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Not my first or even 17th choice for eating, but for drinking at their reverse happy hour? Eff yes.  Just about everything is discounted after 9pm, except on Saturdays there is no half price special on appetizers.   Typical neighborhood crowd at this location, which means very blue collar and mostly 20-somethings. Very affable bartenders who somehow keep their cool amidst the chaos of making drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I have given this applebees so many chances but this night did it for me. We walk in, and they aren't busy. I waited at the hostess counter for 8 minutes before someone came. Got seated, no silverware or napkins, asked for them, they said it's gonna be a bit... What? Food was disgusting and cold. We had no refills on drinks, server never came back after dropping off food. We paid and left will not be coming back. Talked to store manager and she was nice but this happened 3 times to us where the service was terrible and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Food: really can't complain about the food or price. Both are what you'd expect. Nothing to wow you but nothing to disappoint.   Server: considering she was the only one with 5 tables I'm not upset but it wasn't the most attentive.   Inside: they had to wipe our table in front of us because someone didn't. Host and supportive staff could be more attentive. They seemed disinterested."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here yesterday and got you're 2 for  $25 meal. For our appetizer we got the boneless buffalo wings the hot and spicy which was very good. I orderd one of your citrus drinks that have blackberries, club soda and grey goose very very refreshing. My friend got the house margarita she was not very please tasted horrible she could only take a few sips befor sending the drink back. I also got the mango jalapeno drink I finished it but was a Lil to sweet for my liking. My friend got theb bourbon street chicken witch she really enjoyed. I orderd the butchers meat and potatoes. I was very disappointed it was horrible. The potatoes were so bland had absolutely no flavor, no spices no anything. The meat was way over cooked I could barely even chew it because of how tough it was. I had to around the whole thing and A1 sauce salt and pepper to even make it tastes somewhat okay. I was very disappointed. I come here alot and normaly order the same on tray. I now know not to try new thing here it's either a hit or miss. I was also kinda upsetting that the waitress never even asked us if we'd like their food."}
{"text":"I walked in from work the other day and I was starving.  I went for a bike ride on my lunch break earlier in the day and it took a lot out of me.  When I walked in my house, I told my wife I was hungry and she handed me a white to-go container.  I opened it and it was a salad.  I was thinking, cool!  It had dressing on it already so I immediately took a bite.  It was delicious!  I loved it!  My wife told me it was a salad from Applebee's.  I said, \"Well, what kind of salad is it?\"  It turned out to be an Oriental Chicken salad.  It had almonds, lettuce, delicious dressing, red cabbage, shoe string carrot strips, little bits of chicken, and lots of other tasty items.  It was really an awesome salad.  It was so good that I decided to write a review on Yelp! just for the salad.  Four stars for the salad, but I normally would not give Applebee's four stars.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my wife for dinner since we were both too tired to cook and wanted some drinks.  We ordered the side salads and half rack of ribs from the 2 for 25 menu. We then each ordered mojitos. I had a regular one and she got the wildberry mojito.  First, the salads. They were delicious. Everything looked and tasted fresh. They were also quite large so we could have probably just had the salads and been fine.  My regular mojito was ok, but required addition of multiple limes to overcome the soda water flavor.  Her wildberry mojito was absolutely delicious. The strawberry mojito was also very very good.  We both enjoyed our ribs. Not much to say one way or the other about these except that they were good. The fries that came with them were also good. We each took only one bite of the coleslaw and passed on it. The coleslaw definitely needs help."}
{"text":"We waited about 35 minutes before our food came.  They made a mistake and brought me the wrong thing, so I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my food.  By the time it arrived, my friends were already finished and were ready to leave.  I boxed up my food and left.   My dish comes with a side of ranch.  They forgot to bring it out with my meal, so I had to ask for it.   When I received my bill, I was not only charged for the side of ranch that my dish ALWAYS comes with, but I was also charged for the meal that they took back and my meal that I had to wait over an hour for that I never got to eat because it was already so late.  We had to wait another 5 minutes while they removed the first dish from our bill.  I still paid for my dish and the side.  This place was convenient, since we eat so late at night.  I will be going to Twin Peaks from now on."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here during happy hour and our server is horrible. We have been here for an hour and she has come by twice.  The only reason she came by a second time was because I paged her. Its took 20 minutes for drinks to come out.  This is pathetic."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a fan of the Applebee's franchise itself (due to anti-women's health rights) I must say this location is better than most. Our server (John D) was so sweet and attentive. And we didn't have to wait longer than 3 minutes to be seated.   Their new appetizer, beer & cheese dip with pretzel sticks is awesome! But I thought my grilled cheese sandwich was horrible! It had so much cheese on it I couldn't taste the bread and was repulsed by the oozing mass of grease and stinky cheeses used to create this mound of non edible slop.   However, I was pleased to see that they support an organization called \"Alex's Lemonade\" which provides money to children with cancer (if I recall correctly?). Not to mention it is the BEST lemonade ever!"}
{"text":"The overall atmosphere was awesome, everyone was laid back and kind. The waitress we had was good to get our drinks and our order, after that, she came by once. I got salmon with mashed potatoes and shrimp with a side of spinach and broccoli. The ONLY good tasting thing on my entire plate was the broccoli.... the salmon was tough and dry. The mashed potatoes looked amazing but sadly tasted like stale water with a touch of salt. I was pretty disappointed with my food. It's the first time I haven't liked their food. After, we asked the waitress for a dessert menu, she tried just telling us what there was but we wanted to look at our options and take our time. When she was done telling us our options we still asked for a menu to which we got a huge eye roll! She avoided us after that and never came back. I probably won't be visiting this location ever again."}
{"text":"If I could give them more stars I would. It's affordable, delicious, and the wait staff from the hostess, to the busboys, waitresses and manager are very attentive and make sure things get done right. This is one place we visit on a regular basis. I have never had a bad meal or dining experience here. Amazing! and when we do decide to share a dessert, their blondie brownie and ice cream......YUM!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. Staff thought it was more appropriate to sit down, relax and tell jokes than to actually pay attention to the guests."}
{"text":"Sunday night, my fianc√© and I decided to go out for dinner for a cozy date night. We've been to this location a few times before, but it was way different this time around. Our hostess was unfriendly, straight faced, unwelcoming, unpleasant, and rude. No smile, no welcome, she just asked how many and led us to a table. We prefer a booth, so we kindly asked if it were possible to get a booth. She said it would be a few minutes wait, we told her it was fine and we sat in the front waiting. She came to get us to seat is at our wet booth. She cleaned the table off but it was soaking wet when we sat down. We shrugged it off, just trying to enjoy our evening. We used the napkins that our utensils were wrapped in to dry the table ourselves. My fianc√© ordered the 7oz steak, well done, but wanted to replace the seasonal vegetable with French fries and was told she couldn't. Instead of trying to please the customer and saying that it could be done but would be charged as an extra side, she just told us no. We ordered pretzels with cheese as our appetizer. Not good. The pretzels tasted like garlic breadsticks as opposed to actual pretzels and super doughy. And the white queso dip that came with it tasted weird, no flavor. I wish it would've came with beer cheese or something along those lines. It would have made more sense, taste wise. I ordered a club sandwich but wasn't asked what kind of bread, so when I received my sandwich, it was on white bread, I only eat wheat. What was even worse was when my fianc√© cut into her steak, it was really pink all throughout the middle. We had to wait as our waitress passed us 3 times to explain to her that is wasn't cooked well enough. She sent it back to the chef to cook it a little longer, but when she brought it back out, it was still really pink throughout the middle. At this point, we're both cranky and hungry, so I ask for a to go box for my food and for them to just remove the steak order from our check so we can leave. She went to ask her manager to have the steak removed from our check and you would think the manager would come out to apologize on behalf of their staff or see if there was anything that could be done to satisfy us in any way, but no such thing. We received our check and to go box and we left hungry, dissatisfied, and in agreement to never return to Applebee's. I really hope management or ownership takes a look into who is working and running their restaurants. This location has definitely decreased their value since the last time I was here about 8 or 9 months ago."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, first off the waitress didn't tell us it was happy hour. And then she took the food my husband started to eat and gave it to another table. How gross! Then we sent back our steal which was rubber and hard. Finally I just gave up and asked for the manager. He did comp the whole meal. That was the only good thing about tonight. Usually there game is on point. But maybe it was because there was nobody in the place...  in the back."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. From the hostess to the server to the food. Probably will not return to this Applebee's again, if any Applebee's.  Started off by waiting to be greater by the hostess for over 5 minutes. She was busy stacking crayons on a shelf to acknowledge that we came into the restaurant. Horrible hostess.   When being seated the server of the area we were seated in told the hostess that she had to many tables and did not want our table, but the hostess sat is there anyway. Bad start to a even worse meal.   When the server finally came to the table we were asked what drink we wanted and if we were ready. There wasn't a smile on her face or a \"hey I hate that your here but I gotta be happy because its my job\" in her voice at all, she was just down right to the point of rude. We ordered out appetizers and then were told that they were out of what we had ordered. Choosing to not get an appetizer we then waited almost 15 minutes to have our dinner order taken. During this time she walked by our table at least 8 times and then she stopped and asked for our order.   I ordered the Chopped Chicken Salad and when the food finally came out another 20 minutes later it was horrible. My lettuce was soggy and the portion was the size of a side salad not an entree salad.  And the worst part is there were pasta noodles in my salad. Not even sure how that happens???  After waiting another 10 minutes for our server to come back to our table we asked for the manager. She didn't even offer to correct anything.   Overall this was the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant. No coupon or advertised special could bring us back."}
{"text":"I come here often, employees here like to chill next to the bar and gossip about their day, which isnt that bad, but i heard them talking about their sex life and i had my child with me......  my server Alfredo was amazing tho, super professional and knowledgeable.  Maybe management should learn a thing or 2 from that young man."}
{"text":"This place can be quite the trip. Walk in and the greater says follow me, then points at the point and says (and I quote) tall can sit over there. The waiter greets us before he gets to the table and I'm like \"are you our server?\" He says \"yes\" as he's leaning towards me in the table. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the food was hot and it was delicious!! Other than that, this would have been a 2 star visit!!"}
{"text":"Yuck, this place is gross. Not only is the food sub-par, cold, and flavorless.. it turns into a rauchy \"club\" on some nights. I don't know if all Applebee's are trying to do that or if it's just a horrid decision from this one, but I'll never go back. I wish it would shut down and a Chili's built in it's wake. If I'm gonna have chain food I at least want it to taste consistently good and NO nasty skanky \"club\" nights. *gag*"}
{"text":"Got seated right away. Ordered drinks and they arrived fast. Then all went wrong. Waited half hour for refill then got to order food. Ordered the trio platter. Arrived cold and sloppy. The portion size was terrible. The wings were not hot they were dry and tasteless. My nephews kids plate had bigger mini cheeseburgers then mine! and it looks like the steak burrito thing they got on there was taken from a short end piece. The manager took my meal off when I complained but he said next time order something else if I don't like the portion size. Are you kidding me. Next time? How about next time I go to village in which is next door. Food is like Denny's but at least it is served fast, hot, and portions are good. Don't go to this apple bees if you can help it. Find another one. Or go to the Carl's Jr next door you will save money and will be more satisfied."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had an very bad experience tonight. We had to ask for drink refills several times. I had to ask for my salad before my dinner and when she brought it out it was smaller than a fast food side salad. The salmon was so dry and over cooked.  They didn't bring any butter for the potato. They brought two of the three meals out and we waited five minutes before they brought the other. The manager really didn't seem like he cared. While they did take the salmon off of the bill the waitress didn't say anything to us about it. She dropped the bill off and couldn't wait for us to leave. We have eaten there many times and have been very satisfied with the food and the staff, but not this time."}
{"text":"The food was good but our server (Debra, older lady, white and skinny) had horrible customer service. After bringing our food we asked her if she could bring us extra napkins. We waited 5 minutes for her and she just passed by us to ask the next table if they're doing okay. She passed us about 5 times making sure everybody else was fine and not once asked us how we were doing or if we wanted the check. After we finished eating we kindly asked one of the other servers for the check. Our lazy server finally came back and took our food and I told her one of the other servers were getting our check so she said you can pay with me or the machine so we decided to do the machine since she was so rude to us. It seemed that all the other servers were so polite and she was the only one that seemed like she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on us. Next time we go there...if we go back...definitely not wanting her as our server."}
{"text":"Went here one time & the bartender had zero personality. Made our experience really boring especially for a Friday night, it made sense why there were only 5 people there in the whole restaurant. Food was decent, but we will not be returning. At least when I bartend I say hi to all my customers and have small talk so I receive bigger tips than most. Just put a smile on your face & be cheerful makes a huge difference then being cold to everyone at the bar top.."}
{"text":"Love this location. Compared to Craig and Boca Park this one takes the cake! Def worth the drive."}
{"text":"I never been a fan of Apple Bees. There food sucks and normally just go for happy hour drinks. Our waiter was a sweet heart but it took 15 mins to get three beers. The place of business seemed dirty, kids running around the place and it was pretty loud."}
{"text":"First and last time using curbside.   Ordered online picked up order,  got ripped off for 5.00.  Talked to manager he said he would refund my account the overcharge. He never did!  Guess what. . . You lost my business for five bucks.   Also food to go wasn't good,  warm,  no flavor.  Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"After tonight's visit I can see why this chain is closing.   Service was horrible. Food was worse."}
{"text":"My husband and I will never return here again. We go out to eat once a week and this week was a complete waste. Our server was bland and hardly talked at all when he came to the table. We ordered the 2 for 25 and usually get the spinach and artichoke dip when we go to other Applebee's'. The appetizer has now changed, it was very very small and right away we didn't think we were going to get our moneys worth anymore. Things got worse when we ordered the four cheese Mac and cheese with the chicken strips because it tasted like something straight out of the microwave. None of our food was worth 25 dollars. We will not be returning to this Applebee's or ordering off of that menu again!"}
{"text":"It was happy hour and I order my favorite boneless honey bbq wings. It was alright that night for some reason...wasn't as satisfying tonight. Also I am a fish and chips fan so thought I would order some of that!  My goodness! To much batter! barley tasted any fish! and the fries...soggy...enough said. But my ice tea was yummy!"}
{"text":"Headed to Applebee's with my family for the first time in a long time last night.... I ordered the chipotle chicken strips with macaroni and cheese off of the two for 25 menu and my food was served to me lukewarm and the macaroni Tasted old. When I complain in a nice way my waiter took my meal back to the kitchen and the other two people in my party pretty much had their dinner done by the time my food finally came back.   and when it came back it was piping hot and very good.   I was thinking that the manager would come over because I had to send my food back or that the server would comp  my meal or give us a free dessert none of that happened    pretty disappointing.  We will not go back to Applebee's at all especially this one"}
{"text":"Server Jonah took forever to come to the table, I already was ready to give him the food order when he came for drink order (10 minutes of waiting) he took so long to bring the drinks and when the food FINALLY came out it wasn't even him who brought it. Food was cold and it was obvious it had been sitting in the window. Fries were colder than room temperature and the wings were not even warm. My elbow accidentally knocked over my pink lemonade (which I had only taken a few sips of) server Jonah finally walked by and I had to stop him and tell him I spilled my drink. He was beyond irritated and told me if I spill it again next time there WILL be a charge. (As if I did it on purpose to get a free drink) the experience was horrible... will not return"}
{"text":"Alicia was our waitress she was awesome!!! The food was great. Burger was moist/perfect and my penne pasta was so yummy. Thanks for the great service and food!!!"}
{"text":"OK, you should know what to expect from a chain restaurant. This location continues to deliver as expected, although the waiter staff can sometimes not be attentive enough and drinks go unfilled. It's OK food, nothing special, but again it is what you would expect. No signature dish they rave about."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went into this location tonight for the Veterans Day meal. It was very very busy but the staff was super friendly and we sat at the bar and Mike the bartender immediately noticed me and got me a drink and Katie got me a menu and I ordered the 7 ounce sirloin for my daughter and I and it was wonderful! We also had the queso dip with chips and brownie bites for dessert and we really enjoyed our meal. Thank You Applebees for the Veterans Day meals that you provide and I will be back for another 7 ounce sirloin very soon. sincerely, a loyal customer."}
{"text":"The last time I went in we sat at the bar for an early light dinner. A \"regular\" apparently didn't like someone that came in. She tried to get everyone to agree with her. This went on for a long time. Bartender must have been friend of hers because she allowed this chaos to continue. Very uncomfortable situation.  No decent beer on tap and the mixed drinks are way overpriced for the quality. Did I mention the food was substandard and our meals came out separately ......and cold?  We both agreed that was our last time. Then we received a gift card for Christmas. Re-gifting that for sure."}
{"text":"Yes it was busy  being Valentines night ! We sat at the bar ordered quickly received our drinks ordered and received our salads then we waited as 3 other couples sitting next to us and around us received their meals ..... Finally ours arrived clearly been sitting and re microwaved .  Not offered anything  very dissatisfied and will think again before eating here"}
{"text":"What's wrong Charlotte, this horrible service at Applebees made feel like they're struggling to keep business. Family and I went to see what the $1 margaritas were about. We spent more time (almost an hour) waiting on drinks and appetizers then actually consuming the items. When the food got there it wasn't everything together, while waiting my kids meal to get to him when I arrive I just so happen to tap the hard burnt bun turned the bun over and saw the burger was covered in hard burnt cheese. I was livid, I asked to speak to a manager and her apologies wasn't sympathetic enough for my comfort and all was done was a comp of a $2 meal. Weither you're under staffed Applebees with 2-3 Working at dinner time is ridiculous I will not come back to this location. Fix your business!"}
{"text":"Horrible Applebee's  Air conditioning on too high - very cold Sit at table and the trivia games are pay only instead a free thing to pass time while waiting or occupy children  Waiter forgot any extras we asked for Manager came out to table next to us stating they've run out of 2 for 20 steaks, and rather than offer a larger steak in place, she insisted they pick something else Empty plates, soup bowls and appetizer dishes were not cleared from our table until the meal was over Food was not bad, but very average  Wouldn't come here again P.S. Waiter brought us the wrong check at the end of the meal....."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this review. It's a 2 star because the food was good! So my husband and I decided to invite friends and eat at this Applebee's. We ordered the 2 for 20 the artichoke dip, fiesta chicken and chicken fingers and I said I would like to add a desert and right away our server responded \"oh that is not part of the deal\" in a rude condescending voice. I replied \" I know, that is fine!\" He then said he would put the desert in later so it would come out last. Which is was totally fine with me.  We get our food and he comes out with a 3 cheese pasta and fiesta chicken. My husband then says I ordered the chicken fingers, the server then argues and looks at his order book and said no sir that is not what you ordered again in a rude condescending voice. He then takes the food and said we will get you the chicken fingers. Which was nice but if he would have got things the first time he wouldn't have had that miscommunication in the first place. The whole time he treated everyone at our table with the least respect I have ever seen a server treat customers, he in no way went out of the way to please or value our business being there. Oh also he never brought out my dessert he had the audacity to ask if we wanted dessert at the end when he was handing out or checks.  So yes I am disappointed I love Applebee's but I don't know what the deal was with this server tonight and I hope we never get him again. I want to say his name was John and he is the one with small Gage's in his ears. So if you get this server beware!"}
{"text":"I really wanted some Red Lobster that night, but I guess everyone else did, too... We were near Carolina Place Mall and the Olive Garden next door looked just as packed... I figured Applebee's would be uncrowded and a decent choice for food since it had been quite a while since I'd been there... It was just what I expected... The server was nice, the food was good and the prices were reasonable...  The only things that could be improved were the lukewarm temperature of the cheese that came out with the new beer pretzels (which were awesome) and the riblets I ordered were just a bit fatty...  My boyfriend's new shrimp pasta with queso was great... Overall, a solid showing from good ol' Applebee's..."}
{"text":"This applebees is a constant disappointment.  This is my third visit and each visit came with major disasters .. the first visit I ordered the 8oz steak to be told oh we are out the size of steak .  So I switched to the 6oz steak with bake potatoe to be told oh we are out of potatos.  Then it took over 40 minutes for the food .. The second visit we went waited about 15 minutes before even being acknowledged for a seat .  Once we were seated we placed our order we ordered an appetizer and waited for a long time to have the appetizer come 5 minutes before our food .  Then when we received the fish and chips the fish was frozen in the middle and full of half thawed water at that point we were over it and asked for them just to take it off the bill they insisted on redoing it to go and then tried to charge for BOTH orders of the fish dinner .. the THIRD time we went we waited for over 45 minutes for our food then when we did get it the order was completely wrong not even the right entree and the steaks were good the direct opposite of how we asked . My husband asked for well done his steak was rare with blood all over his plate not to mention it was not even the plate he ordered .  We were not offered any compensation or even a solution .  We will not be going back no matter how convient the location is ."}
{"text":"Not happy with our service here. In the beginning we waited a few minutes to be greeted and seated no one there when we walked in. Then we finally sit down and the server is polite and we order. Food comes out fast so we thought everything was better. Then we ordered dessert on a separate bill. Left the server a nice tip even though she hardly came around and drinks were left empty for a while with no checking up on us. 25 minutes later after flagging down a different busser we get the desert and ice cream is melted. We flagged down a different busser again to show him and waited again for ice cream. 10 minutes later we walked up to the bar to get the manager and the busser ran to us with the ice cream apologizing saying he had to do it himself. What happened to the server? She got a good tip for bad service. We were so annoyed we left. Sad considering we give them a lot of business and purchase gift cards with them and now I'm going to have to consider my other ootions. Aside from the busser who was kind we weren't happy to say the least."}
{"text":"Bar staff are great and food is good. What I really like is they host Saturday pancake breakfasts  to support local  groups like bands and scouts who serve the food. Nice to see a national chain act local."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time dining here and I'm not impressed, the first time I came was on Saturday 01/16/16, the place wasn't that busy yet the service was horrible, we were seated right away but it was like the waitress forgot about us!   Came back for the 2nd time on Sunday 01/17/16 for my cousin's birthday dinner, my party and I sat in another area of the restaurant and the service we received was a lot better than the day before.    I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's however I would return back to this location in the future...I didn't say how soon!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday Evening and was told there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table of two with six empty tables we could see.  After waiting for twenty minutes, we were seated at a table that was empty when we walked in!!!!  Ten minutes to get iced tea and a glass of water.  It took 17 minutes to get our food which was four samplers.  The food was good.  And our waitress was sparse and not around enough to get refills on drinks.  We paid out check using the kiosk and left.  While leaving , we saw a groups waiting to be seated when half the restaurant was empty.  It took forty five minutes from entering until getting our food in a half empty restaurant.  We won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Sat down to eat dinner and shortly after eating we noticed a group of ants. They started to crawl towards our table. We immediately notified the staff. We changed seats but absolutely nothing was said but \"I'm sorry\" we still received a full price bill. We did not get to enjoy our food due to being grossed out and I was sadly disappointed I was NOT compensated."}
{"text":"The food takes absolutely forever here. The servers are incompetent and clueless. The bartender seems to be in charge and has to micro manage every order. This place is a joke. And yes, you will be made to wait at the front to be seated without any acknowledgement or greeting"}
{"text":"I'll review both trips to this terrible location.  First trip was a late night trip so expectations were low. They were extremely slow, it was hard getting refills of drinks, and I'm pretty sure I saw our server buy drugs in the parking lot (while waiting for my refill.) this was my first trip and I let it slide because it was late, but we went back last night during normal hours and it was the same situation the server was slow and ride. We had French onion soup which is usually great at Applebee's but it was disgusting, so much so that they comped the soup without us even asking or complaining about it. I will upload a pic of it. My finances steak was cold. They also messed up my entr√©e and we had the same problem with refills. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"So we had the fish and chips in the Oriental chicken salad and for the most part both of them are really good.  No the fish and chips were cooked perfectly french fries could've been cooked a little longer but really good dish and a good portion size. The oriental chicken salad had really good taste in the chicken was grilled really well, the only problem with the salad it seemed like the portion was small.  We went there for lunch and I would say the only hiccup with our experience was the fact we had to wait about 40 minutes before we got our lunch. Our server Sabrina did a wonderful job, she kept or drink glasses filled and she kept checking on us the entire meal she did a great job!"}
{"text":"For lunch they have a real good lunch menu, salads, soup and sandwiches are good.  The lunch specials come with a good price.  Service is fast and food secrets are friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't as good as other Applebee's I have been to but the servers were very helpful and nice! We went on a week night during lunch and it was pretty empty. I ordered the chicken penne and they usually serve alot but here it was about half the size. Not a bad Applebee's but not the greatest!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and so was the service. My husband and I had lunch there today, you can talk without yelling."}
{"text":"$72 of garbage should of went to Wendy's so mad.. Never again!! Lime chicken barely cooked. Kids Mac: kid did not like. Boneless chicken could of been cook longer.. Nachos with stew meat PU. steak .. Margarita limed up no punch.."}
{"text":"Food had a great flavor.  Ate there three times over a two week period.  Ordered the same dish (steak & shrimp) each time.  The first time, it was awesome.  Steak was tender and the southwest flavoring was spot on.    The second time I ate there I had a different experience.  The steak & shrimp was ok, but didn't meet the quality of the 1st visit.  Tonight we at there again and this was the worst of my visits.  The meal was ok, but not as great as the 1st time.  The presentation was also bad.  Everything was clumped into the middle of the plate, with the steak on the top.    Another detractor was the customer service.  Our waitress was slow.  She combined our bills, even though we were separate, then tried to give us the 2 for $20 even though it meant one of us paying more.  I applaud her attempt to saving us money, but she should have asked us first."}
{"text":"A COMPLETE AND TOTAL MESS!  Imagain a bunch of 14 year olds with no supervision running a restaurant. Absolutely no leadership, minimum staff at best, and what is there, lacks knowledge, customer service, and initiative. If there is a manager in that place, they are either 100% incompetent or dead. It's 3PM on a Saturday, over half the tables are empthy, but need to be cleaned, the waiting area is full of people waiting to be seated, people are waiting outside to get in, and people are leaving as they are tired of the wait,  attitude, and overall lack of leadership and organization."}
{"text":"Food was good.. A little disappointed in my Berry Sangria.. Wish it looked and tasted as good as the picture. Nothing stood out to me tho. I might go back for their cheese sticks tho:)"}
{"text":"Our waitress sucked had us waiting for our drinks, appetizers and even food. It's a chill environment is usually have a great experience but my waiter was not the best, she was not friendly and did not give me the best customer service."}
{"text":"For the first time i tried the car side to go.  Was told the food would be ready at like 4:29, waited in the car till about 4:40. Got home and we are missing a big portion of our order, even after the waiter said he checked it and told me it was all there (I trusted him, so i guess shame on me). Called the store and spoke to the manager, he told us to drive all the way back down there and he would give us our missing food, we told him we wouldn't make the drive all the way back over there and waste our time and gas for their mistake.  We asked for a refund of what they didn't give us, we were told no.  Instead we were offered a free entree if we drove all the way back to that store and gave them our name (sounded completely fake, like i'll go in next month and they will have no clue what happened and i'll get screwed again), what they don't understand is we live no where near that store and we were getting it on our way back from Vegas.  So basically they stole money from us by not refunding what they didn't give us.  The food was alright, no real complaints there."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, we waited to be seated for a while all while workers were too busy talking to each other about who knows what. Once seated it took another 15 minutes until our server showed up (not a busy evening for Applebee's). We tried their $25 combo of a 6oz steak medium and a chicken and shrimp skillet. Steak was hard, over cooked and cold by the time we got it. The macaroni and cheese that it came with was not cooked all the way so very rubbery noodles. The chicken was over seasoned and seemed like an old batch they just refried. Horrible service. Horrible food. I do not recommend. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place since I was a kid and for good reason (I had discovered that if I wanted quick, cheap, and dirty that I could just buy a microwave meal), the only reason I came back was for the \"dollar margaritas\" happening this month. For the $1 margaritas, there is no catch, you go in and can get drink after drink after drink for a dollar (50 cents extra for different flavors) the only problem is that they water the drink down after the first one. I came in expecting to leave a bit tipsy, but was basically sipping on juice/grenadine and water by the third one. The food was terrible, it literally tasted like it went from freezer, to microwave, plate, to us...and this was after our waiter forgot what we ordered twice. He did the same for the margaritas, completely forgetting what was ordered and making us wait a very long time. I blame most of this on the rush of a Friday night, but I also think that the restaurant didn't anticipate the high influx of people looking to get cheap alcohol. It wasn't that they were understaffed, it was that the staff was unorganized and overwhelmed. Our waiter also seemed a bit fed up and I get it, but still not the best customer experience."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve even one star.Zero customer service.Last night(08.20) I placed the order to pick up over the phone with the manager on duty.That was my first time experienced Applebees. She told me that my order will be ready in 15 min.So I drove there like in 20 min to pick my oreder up.Once I walked in ,nobody greeted me ,they never asked me if I need a help.The plece looked like a disaster. I sat down at the bar,which was full of dirty plates and glasses,in a meantime this pregnant server was passing me by like few times and never said \"hi,how can I help you?\".I had to let her know myself that I am here to pick up .After that she said,oh the manager will bring the order to you.I looked around for a manager she, was serving a table next to me and when she passed by (without greeting me)I told her that I am waiting for my food like for 40 min.She looked at me from top to head,like I am bothering her,without any apology she told me that it's coming out soon.So I waited for another 10 min and the worst part of this experience was that the manager almost throw the bag with my food to me like a bone to a dog. She never told me \"here is your food m'om ,sorry for delay and ect.\"I was shocked.I work as a bartender for 10 years I never seen anything like this. HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Place works very slow the severs keep playing around and when I got my spinach artichoke dip there was noodles on the inside of it."}
{"text":"My family and I have frequented this Applebee's so many times for family events-birthdays, late night talks, etc.  The service varies from time to time. I have been where it was an empty restaurant and waited for 45 minutes before someone asked us for drinks and another 15 before we got up and left because the drinks never came...  I have also been where the service is great. We have a party of 20+ people at times and get excellent service.   I have to give a shout out to blondies :) yes this desert is incredible. It's probably the #1 reason I go to Applebee's. Middle of the night sister crisis-calls for blondies and coffee. Lol :) everyone should try a blondie at least once :-)"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are 2 links for this Applebee's location.  I had the Asian Chile boneless wings and mozzarella sticks.  I thought the wings would taste more teriyaki but they didn't, thank goodness.  They had a little spicy kick at the end.  Wings were 55c each all day Tuesdays, maybe Mondays too.  The moz sticks are 1/2 off during happy hour, until 7pm.  Also, $10 bottle of wines all day, everyday.  If you drink 2 glasses or more, it's a better deal.  They will reseal it so you can take it home.    They have a jukebox where you can actually play songs from the jukebox or download an app.  I think it's called Touchtunes.  Besides the jukebox, they were playing upbeat 80-90s music.  Songs we great up with.  Brings back good memories.  While Applebee's appear more of a \"family\" restaurant, the music makes the environment seem more upbeat.    Finally, Michael is a great bartender.  He is old school.  Meaning, he actually makes conversations with the patrons, and appears genuine and natural at it.  Oh, one more thing.  They used to have homemade chips, like potato chips.  It's no longer on the menu.  Too bad, it was really good!"}
{"text":"New wood fired grill menu. I had the salmon it had a smokey wood fired taste with grill marks, it was served with a maple glaze on the side. I am glad because it was nasty to taste, so my salmon was a little dry but still good.   My husband's sirlon steak was really good! Very moist, melt in your mouth. We both had the new grilled veggies and garlic green beans.   We started with the french onion soup and it was really good.  The beef broth was dark and concentrated, the baggette was nice size bit the melted gooy cheese was the best part!  New menu good, would come back again, service was way to slow, we had no set ups and when they brought out our food we asked for some, it took way to long to bring us silverware and the food got cold waiting!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 for $20 deal (includes an app and 2 entrees).  We ordered a spinach and artichoke dip with chips, a steak, Chinese chicken salad, quesadilla, and a blueberry, chicken salad. The dip was pretty tasty.  But the steak, Chinese chicken salad and quesadilla were SALTY.   The deals are that, but because of the preparation, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I've always like Applebees. I haven't returned in years until recently and I enjoyed their happy hour specials - the drinks are cheap and fairly strong. 1-2 is great for me! (Cheap date, I am).  A few appetizers are half off - wings, wonton tacos and a couple others. I'm def coming back sooner than several years.   Our waitress was great - very friendly, always returning to make sure we were good."}
{"text":"Applebee's used to be a favorite for me and my family but they have made some menu changes that have really been disappointing! For example-  The portion sizes on all of the appetizers that are part of the trio have gotten smaller. The soft pretzel sticks are skinnier than my fingers. The boneless wings were hard and not fully tossed in sauce. The only decent app was the spinach dip (and that had a rubbery layer of cheese over top they needed to be removed before eating. Rubbery, not warm bubbly melty)    They other app we ordered was the salsa verde beef nachos. Gross. Completely unseasoned hamburger meat on nachos with thick raw jalape√±os rings. In the picture I had already chopped up the jalape√±os into smaller pieces.   Also, the kids meal was $4.99 and was a single tiny cheeseburger with very few fries. Shown in the picture. Very disappointing. Save the money and skip the ciabatta bread bun and use regular cheap buns like kids prefer and GIVE 2 SLIDERS you cheapskates. Ugh.   I recommend only going for the cheap drinks and skipping the food. I hear they have $1 Long Islands this month."}
{"text":"Why are the tables and menus always sticky? We only got 3 forks to eat our meal with no spoons no knifes... my water had something floating in it. Everyone is in a hurry slow down and remember what we asked for! I came back a second time because I thought maybe they had a busy night.... nope it was even worse. Waitress never gave refills never asked if we wanted a box. She also looked at me when I called her because our food was so late coming out. She quickly swiped her card and suddenly 15 mins later we got food. Sat out bill on the table and walked away. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Was a busy night, only saw our waitress twice, once for drinks other for check, bartender came out and helped and was very helpful. Waitress forgot to bring one of our apps out."}
{"text":"The food was good and I have no complaints there but the service was horrible we were a large party celebrating birthdays and we're all servers as well which was even better. It took two hours for us to all get taken care of in and out. And our server Fabiola was rude like she didn't want to take us. She kept disappearing and avoiding our table. We had to ask other servers for drinks. Fabiola needs some more training. Maybe she needs to come get some training at our restaurant because our boss wouldn't let customers leave unhappy."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my daughters and I feel like this apple bees always takes for ever to serve you, and the place wasn't even full 40mim just to serve us all tho the waitress was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nice omg I dint get her name but she was amazing, great service but the cooks always take for ever."}
{"text":"Service was ok but the food was just terrible. I remember Applebees being consistently good. Maybe it's just this location"}
{"text":"Service was okay but the food was terrible. I ordered a mushroom swiss burger. Terrible tasting burger. Just bad food... Stay away.  Next morning update...  Just like another reviewer mentioned, mild food poisoning is on. Been to the bathroom 3 times already."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and wasn't disappointed. Been a while since going to one of these establishments and it was pretty busy but was seated immediately.. the classic cheeseburger was cooked to my liking and fries were much better than I expected. Sriracha shrimp n boneless wings for appetizers! Food was on point n attentive service was even better. Only thing I'd change is the timing between receiving food. Apps came out and entrees arrived about two minutes after.. other than that the dining experience was pretty cool, been a while since being here but impressed with the service, food, and dining experience."}
{"text":"Stopped thru after a late movie to check out the menu n see if there was something that caught my eye. I went with the quesadilla burger and Sriracha shrimp! Our server was Sara and she really made the experience a plus/plus! She was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable on the menu!! Sara was upbeat and offered suggestions and gave feedback and insight on the items we ordered! \"The verdict\" has been announced, top notch customer service really matter, especially these days when some places can't get it right as two left shoes..haven't been to Applebee's in a while but this experience prompts me to return n check out more of the menu. The atmosphere was cool, not too loud but just right..the cleanliness of the restaurant was superb and we were wArmly greeted with a smile by everyone even after what I'm sure was a long day for the folks on shift. I was impressed by the entire staff there, including the kitchen staff's expedience Getting our appetizers and dinner choices out to us. I'd recommend checking this place out if searching in the area for a great quaint little spot for food/drinks, you most likely won't be disappointed, especially if get the pleasure of being helped by Sara! Customer service is big to me and that made my experience so well I had to write on it! Two thumbs up.."}
{"text":"We generally try to eat out in Madison at non chain restaurants, however, here and there it makes sense as they typically offer a varied menu or are convenient went looking for a bite to eat.  6 months ago my boyfriend and I went to Applebees on a Saturday (early afternoon/evening).  I have no idea what are motivation was for going there, but we did. We were seated up to the right of the hostess stand as soon as we walked in. Waited 10 minutes, and no service. A server walked by the table and we thought they'd just let us know that they were behind and would be right with us. Nope. I'm not sure how much more time passed maybe 5 or 10 more minutes, but it was significant enough for me to convince my boyfriend that we should leave. And so we did. We got up, walked out and nobody said a word or noticed.  Fast forward to today, where again we were in the area, looking for a late lunch, and decided we'd give them another shot. We were seated in the exact same area, and there were other patrons seated there as well. The restaurant itself I would say was busier than what I expected (I was thinking it would be completely dead) but by no means crazy busy or filled to the max with customers. We waited a little bit, browsed the menu, decided what we were getting and still nobody checked in with us. The hostess even sat a few people after us in the same section.  So, again we decided it wasn't worth it to stay and eat and got up and left only to find another restaurant in the area to eat at.   It seems from other reviews there are a lot of issues with this location. We gave it two shots recently and it didn't meet our expectations. We are pretty patient people and very easy going, so leaving a restaurant after being seated is not the norm for us. I would avoid coming here."}
{"text":"I am surprised this Applebee's has gotten negative reviews. I've eaten here at least 15 times in the last 2 years and have never had a bad experience. Maybe we were just lucky? The one thing I can say for sure is that the customer? service has always been top notch. This location has the friendliest staff. Food quality has always been consistent. Bathrooms are clean. For a chain restaurant, this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"We came on needing to get in & out in 45 min. It's date night!  Sat at the bar, had great service from Joe behind the bar. He took our order & is dedicated to get us out on time for or movie. Suggested Walnut Crest 2012 Merlot the whole bottle for $10, it is a very smooth Merlot, we were quite surprised! We'll come back just to see Joe! Food came quickly & it's delish & quite hot!"}
{"text":"Haven't made it out to this location in a while nice to say things have improved. Service was excellent and the food was hot and came out in a timely fashion. Definitely an upgrade from my previous interactions. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location we had a great server named Melissa she was very attentive food was great we were seated fast and all staff was friendly . When you enter you have to veer off to the left or you will be at Steak and Shake there is alot of vacant property around but conveniently located off Transportation Blvd off 480. Kudos Applebees."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because service has been great the last couple of times at this location. There are new menu items and prices are still great . I must point out that I sat at the bar with Marlean, \"great lady\" and they have installed charging stations at the bar for cell phones ! What a great idea for all of us cell phone junkies! Great service and smiles from the staff, Kudos Applebees!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna drop my rating to 4 stars the service is slipping we have been waiting 7 minutes we haven't even met the waitress yet. The food preparation is still good but looks like all new employees here ."}
{"text":"Came in on New Year's Eve because it was the only restaurant in town that wasn't packed. Should've stayed home. My steak came out raw when I asked for medium and it took them another 15-20 minutes to get my plate back to me. Asked the server for another beer and she said \"when it gets a little lower we will bring you another one.\" Because apparently you have to finish you beer here completely before you can order another one. Won't be coming back here again. This restaurant is a complete mess."}
{"text":"Emo our waiter was very rude on Camelback and Central.  He didn't  explain the options that come with my meal.  Its a new menu and The Perfect Margaritas are no longer on the happy hour price/menue . I can tell Emo was having a bad day and taking it out on our service. People  go out to eat to undwind and relax and expect great service,  just make sure to request a different waiter if you want to have good service...."}
{"text":"I must confess that after reading the reviews I had my fingers poised to add my disgust and disappointment in the place too.  However,  reluctantly (yes,  I admit it) I must confess that it wasn't all that bad.  Our server wasn't the best,  she looked like she couldn't be more bothered.  But I guess after she sensed we were ok peeps she let her guard down a bit.  Our food came at a reasonable time and my salad was pretty dang on good!  Was it my favorite place?  Nah,  but I can't say I'd never go back.  The Maple Brownie makes all the pain go away every time..."}
{"text":"No more breadstick for you ...    My co-worker and I went  to Applebee's for lunch, it was after 1, so we figured the rush would be gone. We each ordered the USS (unlimited soup and salad). While we were eatting our server asked if we wanted to have another go around of soup and salad, while I love love soup, I am not big on salad, so I said I would have soup and another breadstick, he said sorry we are only allowed to give one breadstick per USS deal. What? Really? Yep, if you want unlimited breadsticks you better head east to Olive Garden. I will say that it is a good deal for the $6.99 price, if you are a salad fanatic, then you will love the 8 varieties to choose from and the cup of soup is a hearty portion."}
{"text":"Exactly, Meh, I've experienced better. I really try to avoid negative reviews, but this one was needed. Your sit down choices in Laveen are limited to Native New Yorker, a handful of Mexican dives, and of course the local Applebee's (hurry up Barros Pizza!) Twice we ordered curbside and twice they got it wrong. Both times portions of the meal were missing, not only did we wait 10 more minutes than promised, we waited 10 more minutes for the missing food! Also disappointed potato skins were taken off menu."}
{"text":"After my Uber Eats order came to my door with an entree missing, my husband called and the girl who put the order in answered the phone. We told her the order was wrong and she said \"oh yeah, I forgot.\" When asked to speak to a manager, she laughed and hung up. After calling back and being put on hold for a manager, we decided to drive there with the incomplete order. We set the food down and Marcus, the Bar Manager came over. We explained the situation (both of us clearly annoyed) and he diffused the situation quickly. He let us keep the food (so we could give it to a homeless person seeing as the restaurant would just throw it away) and he made our complete order again and threw in a dessert for free. He was very pleasant to speak with and he corrected the situation the girl created. Logan, a host, was also apologetic and waited on us while we waited for our completed order. He was also pleasant to speak with. The girl however, I do not know her name. I hope this person got reprimanded for her rude and incompetent actions. I was going to leave a 2 star review, however because of Marcus and Logan, this one gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place has lazy managers who don't train staff properly. Managers don't check to see how customers are doing. We were over-charged for happy hour appetizers. Soup special was out at 5pm. Our waiter was not trained."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, brought my daughter here for her birthday and food was burnt and it took 35min to get a refill after the server told me 2 times he was gonna go get it. Manager tried to make it right but failed, still got charged for a burnt meal. This place is ridiculous. Never again"}
{"text":"Food was good. Price is fair. Portions were small. Went in for lunch and service was slow for a couple salads."}
{"text":"We stopped by tonight for happy hour and everything was amazing. Our server DJ is amazing and we only come here because of her. We drove at least 20/30 minutes just to see her."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up from this Applebee's earlier today and was honestly so shocked at how good the service was that it deserved a review. Every single person I dealt with was polite, positive, and helpful. I actually walked out with a smile because of how nice everyone was there."}
{"text":"Not impressed   The server was pleasant enough but we waited over 15 minutes for an appetizer. She didn't refill drinks. The food was lukewarm when it arrived at the table.  My salad was missing 3 items that were supposed to be on the salad.  When I sent it back, it looked as though the items were thrown on. Not very appetizing. Asked for a manager, she never came to the table. Although we could hear her yelling at staff in the kitchen.  I had the same salad at the North Huntingdon PA location and it was a totally different salad. The lettuce was crisp, the components artfully arranged and the shrimp was hot. Bad night? Not sure and we won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"This apple bees is pretty awesome. Everytime I come here I seem to get the same waitress.  Destiny is and princess incredible service. The food here is decent, and comes out hot and delicious.   for some strange reason service is faster here when it gets busy,  but over all the still provide good food and service."}
{"text":"besides o.k alcohol prices during happy hour... the food has disappointed me more than once now... I'm sorry Applebees but we are officially breaking up. we had our moments but they have come and gone...disappoint me once and I will forgive you but twice then i just become a bitter girl that I even spent my money here...  goodbye Applebees and hello Chili's !!( i know its mean, but breakups are hardly ever nice )"}
{"text":"This applebee is pretty bad. We ordered the boneless wings for appetizer and took them about 40 mins. IT WAS SO SALTY. Worst part, you can tell the food is frozen. Very disgusting. I won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were here during a slow time and still received very slow service. It took forever to get a drink while we were sitting at the bar and again it took a long time to receive our check. The manager that was here was also glaring at us while we were trying to have a good time which then ruined the atmosphere. We felt like we were being judged for trying to enjoy ourselves. Overall probably will not return, this is why Chili's is a much better option. If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"This review is for a take out order.  After placing my online order for pick up,  I received a call to confirm my order and substitutions/special requests.  The lady had a happy tone and attitude,  however I forget her name.  I believe she was the same peppy waitress that quickly gave me my food when I arrived.   She was cheerful and checked the bags and confirm with me that everything was there.  Everything was ready except my drink but I did not wait long.  I grabbed my food and let her know how great she was and I will definitely be ordering for pick up again!"}
{"text":"Literally just left from this location after being disrespected. I brought my partner with the two children for what I hoped would be a wonderful Mother's Day brunch. We arrived and everything was fine, then we start hearing the rest of the waiters besides us saying happy Mother's Day to everyone else except us. So we just desire to ignore but Then we see the MANAGER COME OUT AND DOES THE SAME THING, goes table to table wishing everyone a happy Mother's Day and giving them discount coupons. He does the table next to us and passes in front of us and does not say a word, looks at us, the children, then skips our table and continues to the following family a happy Mothers Day along with handing them coupons. So he literally saw us as a couple with children and thought one of two things, \"oh they're lesbians they can't be mothers, OR he thinks negatively of young mothers , mind you 28 isn't that young .. we felt looked down on as he didn't even ASK TO SEE IF ONE OF US WAS A MOTHER or even greeted us as customers.  He completely ignored us. Completed under-minded the whole celebration. Unfortunately we had already ordered so we just stayed to eat the food. I would expect much much more from the managers. This was supposed to be a special day and the entire staff we had contact with did nothing but neglect and deprive us from a very special celebration. Extremely disappointed. If you're a \"young\" mother  or gay I DO NOT recommend going here apparently the manager has an issue with that on Mother's Day ."}
{"text":"AppleBees 44rh street and Thomas is probably the worst service i have ever experienced when going out to eat. If I can give a half star i would. We had a fair size party of 6 adults 4 children.. we were celebrating graduation and mother's day.. to begin with we waited an hour to be seated, and the restaurant was empty!! Then wated 30 min to get served drinks.. i even called the manager over who helped with our drinks.. half of us got our food and the other half got cold food and our orders were not correct.   We left with half the party not eating..  the General manager did end up comping our check... but I will NEVER eat at an Applebees again!!!"}
{"text":"Never had a prob here at all. The food is good and the servers have always been friendly. Had the new shrimp combo platter. Very good."}
{"text":"No only have we waited 8 min for someone to come over and take our drink order.  She tried to tell us we can only have the appetizers in the bar!!!!! WTF GET YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never thought I would be leaving a 4 star review for Applebee's after the many years of meeting my Mom/grandma/old person there for a special dinner/lunch and leaving disappointed.  6 or so years ago I finally put my foot down and started directing my older family members to other restaurants that were better in my book(of course they didn't see it the same way). Fast forward 6 years...wife and I want an easy place to go, close by with a simple menu.  Weren't that hungry for food, mainly libations, so we figured why not...lets hit the Applebee's by our house.  Beer was cold, her margarita was surprisingly great with fresh ingredients and 1800 tequila, not the pre-mix sugary crap.  Got an appetizer sampler and a salad and everything was....good...not great, but above average good.  Perhaps things have changed...I will go again and see if it was a fluke...hope not as many of these new places while cool in concept, are overhyped and overpriced."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Slow as molasses.  Waitress even confused my wife's card with someone else's and had to go back and redo both tickets.  It's not that complicated, you know.    Food was awful. Had high hopes for the bourbon chicken and shrimp, and was very disappointed. The quesadilla burger didn't taste bad, but it was really greasy.  Screaming kids were awful.  Tacky decor.  Menus need to be wiped down at least every other month whether they need it or not.    The only reason this is 2 star instead of one is because they accidentally brought me two beers instead of the one I ordered, so that was comped.  It was like getting the \"Bank error in your favor, collect $50\" card in Monopoly."}
{"text":"If your looking for a fun bar, don't go here.... If you picture a bar with good music and everyone laughing then this is not the place to go... We went in ready to have a good time but between the 60's- 80's mix and the sleepy atmosphere we were ready to go have some actual fun... If your 60-80yrs old this is your place, if your young and want fun this is not even an option.... I'm sitting here now and it's Saturday night and 11:00pm and I'm ready to go to sleep in a booth at the bar....."}
{"text":"first time there.. i was not impressed. I had a child in tow, they offer nothing to help with the baby at all, like a booster seat, coloring pages maybe? So if you have children, i suggest go to another restaurant.  I ordered some appetizers and almost laughed when she brought them out. Not only did she bring them out after she brought our food out already, but I spent 9 dollars for two small pretzels? They either need to make the portion bigger, or cut the price down. Ridiculous. I expected at least enough for the people at the table with me."}
{"text":"Blast to the past--Applebee's, ye of the dotcom boom and overwhelming 1990s popularity, only to fall out of favor in recent years.  So if you haven't been to Applebee's in a decade or so, here are my impressions.  In general there is generous amount of staffing (servers, runners, bussers) and and service is fast and friendly.  Despite that flat screen TVs have been the norm for years, you'll find Applebee's that still have CRT TVs (aka giant tube screen).  This particular location has upgraded to the flatscreen TVs, I counted about 7 or so mostly centered around the bar in the middle.  Sugary drinks here are CHEAP.  Now, the drink glasses are deceptively sized and have a lot of ice but still, $2-$3 for some of their sweet mixed beverages (such a Long Island Iced Tea) is pretty darn cheap.  Even Applebee's has bought into the local movement and they offer a small selection of Wisconsin beers (Lakefront, Tyranena, New Glarus, Ale Asylum, etc) for $5/bottle.    Food: Applebee's is pretty much the worst place for vegetarians, aside from BBQ.  Vegetarians, prepare to eat french fries, salads w/ no chicken (but not discounted), a grilled cheese, or, uh, more french fries.  The majority of the entrees are chicken based: lots of variations of grilled chicken breast on a bed of rice/veggie, with cheese and sauce.  A Weight Watchers menu with calorie counts is available, and these appear to be some of the best of the bunch, although there's no way I believe their calorie counts (I think it's quite an underestimation).  The WW menu is mostly the abovementioned chicken/rice/veg combo, salad, or salad.  Although it's an American restaurant, interestingly, they've seemed to really play down their burger selection, and instead focus on grilled chicken breast everywhere.  All locations are child-friendly with kids' menus, high chairs, crayons, etc.  After 10PM, some drinks& appetizers are discounted.  Overall, I'm not sure how to rate this place: compared to other restaurants?  Not that great, but not bad.  The entrees aren't mindblowingly amazing, but get the job done, and service is quite effecient.  If I were to use an Applebee's or other similar tier chain restaurant as a metric, I would actually rate this higher.  They did upgrade their TVs, good service, and by Applebee's measures the menu is getting more progressive (avocado, cilantro, local beers).  Summary: If ye are scared of going to Applebee's, don't be, it's really not a sad story as some of us have been taught while being obsessed with the latest local organic small batch artisan place.  Except if you're vegetarian; in that case, brace yourself for some romaine lettuce and french fries."}
{"text":"Lunch = yes.  Dinner = no.  We go from well-prepared, decent portions and really good value to so-so prepared, small portions and not nearly the value."}
{"text":"Excellent service, Toni is great! We had soup and salad for lunch. Portions have gotten smaller, but the tomato basil soup is great!"}
{"text":"As always food was amazing. The place really look dingy. In my opinion they need to remodel all of their stores.  Playing some music during late night hours would also add some spunk and just might draw in some bigger crowds. To me the place feels lifeless and seems to be barista holding on."}
{"text":"Slow as hell and the food spilled all over my car which pissed me off even more. I'll never do curb side them ever again."}
{"text":"We gave this restaurant another chance after having mediocre experiences in the past. The host, Kara, was fantastic. Several customers arrived at the same time and she kept things moving. She would keep us all informed and we were seated within the time frame she promised. Our server, Ashley, was excellent. She knew the menu and was attentive. She made us feel like her only customers despite a full house! All of the food was served promptly and was delicious. My husband enjoyed his Cajun spiced steak and my son's burger looked and tasted delicious. The Riblet Platter was great and the Oriental Chicken Salad was fresh. The grilled chicken was quite tasty. Overall, an excellent experience. We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I came to this location with my boyfriend for a small snack. It was almost empty, but we still waited a long time for a small kids meal. We had to ask a few times for ranch which we finally received 10 minutes later. Service was terrible overall, food was getting cold so it seems like it was ready just not served in a timely matter. I am not returning to this location. Never. Again."}
{"text":"Dec. 19 2016 2pm I was shocked by the behavior of the blonde server named Erica. She was in a hurry for us to finish and leave. She stated that she gave us a side order of mac and cheese by mistake. I was done with my main entree and veggies and I  was really to stick my fork in the mac and cheese, she took the food right off my table and ignored me when I calmly asked \"Excuse me miss \". I went up front to pay as she ignored us after her taking food I was just about to taste.  I asked the dark skinned waitress to speak to a manager. Erica came by and said You are trying to make a scene.  I told the manager that this tattooed blond girl had three uncomfortable confrontations with me. Never apologized and was proud of her rude disgusting behavior.   I had just had coffee and I am a cancer survivor that just went through a severe illness and I had to have an embarrassing confrontation with her and Jamie her manger. They acted the way they did as we were two disabled customers and they feel they can treat anyone different thus way.  It really gave me anxiety and a bad feeling for this holiday season.   I would like a refund for her upsetting me.  I will a speak to corporate tomorrow morning   The food was fine but nothing special."}
{"text":"My Favorite anytime of day , I always have Great Service and Amazing Food.Jessica was a Sweetie and Amanda made me a Great Adios Mother Fucker"}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty decent.  Last time I was there, the waitress accidentally double charged us for drinks, then took off $4 from the bill.  Except that it was not how much two drinks were, or the fact that we got charged tax on the entire bill prior to the \"discount.\"  Don't be lame, just fix the bill right, so we don't have to have a conversation about it.  (Instead of complaining, I only tipped 15%, when I am normally a 20% tipper.)"}
{"text":"I really have no idea why Applebee's service is starting to go downhill. Last time I came to Applebee's is was a different location in North Town (it was way worse) had to wait and to say the least, I have patience but to not be acknowledged for at least 10 minutes I went to ask one of the servers for assistance. She ended up being our server; I was really disappointed because I've worked in this industry (on the strip, to be exact.) it's slow by the way here or short staffed whatever the case , I'm really frustrated plus there were a couple of ladies who were sat after us , got their food already and already have left!"}
{"text":"Why is there a tiny flatscreen at my table?! I don't want a constant advertisement right next to me. Killed my appetite. Why advertise crappy food? A good idea would be to give your cooks a raise. Horrible corporate idea!! I love it, instead of paying actual chefs, or giving your guys a raise, they'll spend thousands putting a constant advertisement at your table. Way to go down hill!! Apparently you don't trust your servers either, they will tell your guests what's best. Nothing says screw the employees more than a constant advertisement at the table!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly service. Nothing to rave about but only minor complaints too.  We were seated for lunch quickly and got a table per our request (not a booth). The host was humerus as was our waitress, who was working her first shift ever.  The food: respectable prices and very appropriate proportions-not too much and not too little that you're still hungry. The food prep execution lacked and was very slow to leave the kitchen. My favorite, the French onion soup, was undercooked and I sent it back for a Caesar salad instead. The salad was drenched in a heavy dressing that tasted and made my mouth feel like I was eating mayonnaise.  The club grill? Tasty, salty, crunchy, tangy.. Avoid the Lettuce which wilts during heating. The burger w bacon and blue? Also good. Cooked well. However I heard a waitress explaining to another table that medium well meant pretty much cooked through! Huh? No way! That's well (mostly gray and definitely not dried out or burned). Stay atop of this helpers and ensure industry standards are just that-standards!  Lighting and ambiance: we sat far from the windows and it was DARK. During the afternoon I expect it to be brighter. The decoration was mild, holiday themed without too much local stuff cluttering the walls.  Payment: fast, accurate.  Overall: I won't likely return to Applebee's in general unless someone else picks it. I was disappointed that a favorite dish slipped through quality control. It appears the kitchen is the issue so stick to drinks!"}
{"text":"Bumping this up to 5 stars. As I have stated before, they have really good appetizers... the wings and the mozzarella sticks are my favorite. For Dinner there is a really good 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper tenders... get them! They are amazing! Both the mac n cheese which has some bacon in it, and the chicken tenders (OMG so good) are great choices. If you're thinking you want a less caloric meal, go for the lemon Parmesan shrimp on the 550 or less menu. It is really good, and I always get a side of the stuffed mushroom for less than $2 extra. So good. Service is usually always great, and I haven't had a meal I didn't like here."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Very attentive and friendly.  Our meals were nice and hot, fast and honestly it was the best meal I've ever had at an Applebee's."}
{"text":"This is not the neighborhood restaurant I seat at the bar to order the manager approach in ask me if I want something I drink I reply I take a Sam I put few appetizers in the little computer at the bar when I try to put something else a Pettit light brunette ask me if I want to order I reply because she took the screen of my hands with very bad attitude I asked her something wrong she replied what you try to order we don't have it I said ok she was very upset & kind furious I called the manager in told him I didn't like her attitude he try to smooth the situation he put my order never ask me what really happens he didn't say nothing to her I believe she was the bartender with the bad day as a guess I don't care about her day mostly when I pay bad experience for a local restaurant sincerely A.Luna"}
{"text":"I went on Thursday which is Kareoke night loud and drinks are 1/2 price. Food isn't any good though"}
{"text":"I was out voted, and off to Applebee's for dinner we went.  When we arrived, we were seated within minutes.  That rates 1 star.  Our waitress (Sara) didn't get over to the table for at least 10 minutes, and was incredibly slow to even bring 4 drinks (2 of which she didn't even know which was which).  At least we finally got them since everyone at the table was very thirsty.    For dinner, I ordered the Butcher cuts and potatoes.  It looked like a large and delicious meal.  What I was served, was smaller than an order of loaded nacho chips, and looked nothing like the picture (see the pictures below).  There were only 2 pieces of grilled tomato and 4 or 5 pieces of broken onion rings scattered over the meal rather than a stack piled high on the meal like in the picture.  The pieces of butchers cut meat were all tough pieces of meat.  I've seen better meals from Banquet TV Dinners.    When the bill came and when I looked it over, I saw they were charging full price for the 2 beers even though it was clearly happy hour and they have the advertisements propped up at every table.  When we asked the waitress about it, she said it would get fixed, and that the customer has to ask for the happy hour price in order to get it. Really?  The customer has to ask for something the restaurant advertises at every table?    I did try this restaurant once before on a holiday.  That time, the manager was out front trying to keep the people waiting to be seated from leaving.  I watched him seat a loud complaining couple at a large booth for 6 and kept parties of 4 or more impatiently waiting to be seated.  After waiting and watching the unprofessionalism of the manager, we told him he could scratch our name from the list and that we were going somewhere else for dinner.  He rudely replied that it would be at least an hour wait at any place we went to.  10 minutes later, we were seated at a different restaurant and enjoyed a nice meal.     I wouldn't recommend this restaurant because of the unprofessionalism of management, the seemingly deceitful excuses by the staff and poor quality of the food.  I like to relax and enjoy the meal when I go out.  I left irritated and unhappy with the whole meal."}
{"text":"It started bad and didn't get better.  Our server had to be told 3 times to bring lemon for our water and tea.  We ordered the 2 for 25 and got the house salads which was the best part of the meal.  The butcher block dinner was not great.  The steak was tuff and dry.  The server did not come back to check on us after he brought the meal.  On top of that it was freezing in there!"}
{"text":"At this location cold food and waiting A while for your food go hand in hand.  Sometimes I wish I really could rate with negative stars, because one Star is too generous. I've been to many Applebees but this one is by far the worst experience. I ordered 10 boneless wings  (5 Buffalo and 5 spicy Asian) and got 5 cold Buffalo and I'm not sure if they tried to compensate their mess up by giving me 10 Asian... So I let it slide. My wife got a salad with meat (which the meat also happened to be cold)... Still let that slide. But then we ordered a blondie which took forever, but that wasn't much of a problem... The problem is that after waiting for the blondie for so long, the cake was cold, there was absolutely no reason to bring it out on a skillet, because even the skillet cold. What I like the most about the blondie is the warm cake with cold ice cream, it's like warm apple pie and ice cream, they go together... To top it off,I was charged for a drink I didn't even order, that was the true icing on the cake for my visit!"}
{"text":"After doing some studying at the Starbucks across the street at Barnes and Noble, I decided to check out Applebee's 9pm-11pm reverse happy hour. Upon walking in on a Tuesday night, I found the restaurant to be fairly slow, which can be expected for early in the week.. There were one or two people up at the bar which was great. Easy peasy seating. Yes!!  Shortly after sitting down, was greeted by the bartender (Megan). During my happy hour visit, she was friendly, helpful, and fun to chat with. Really appreciate genuinely nice employees. Sometimes hard to come by in Vegas.   I have always been a big fan of reverse happy hours and this one, has some decent deals. Check out my pics for what's actually on happy hour. Remember I'm a menu junkie.   Kept my order very simple and just ordered 2 Large Bud Lights ($4 each) and the Crispy Wonton Tacos ($4). The beer was ice cold and the tacos were crunchy, yummy, and left me wondering if I should order more. (I didn't)  A great experience and will be back for more. Thanks Megan, Reyna, and Applebees. You didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Restrooms were clean. $11:84 WITH tip for a hamburger and fries. I would have done better walking to the Golden Corral.  Hamburger had an off taste that I covered with ketchup. Fries were hard. Maybe it was me but I am not coming back. Had to ask for Silverware."}
{"text":"Great service. Wait staff went out of their way to be accommodating. Got kids food out early which is always a huge plus. Manager came to make sure my mothers food was truly gluten free because she has celiacs(their fries share a surface with gluten infused foods so they made sure to inform her)  for a chain i was super impressed with their service on a busy friday night."}
{"text":"It is Applebee's, so you know you're getting chain restaurant food, but this location has great staff most days. And the best is DJ, a bartender and server that handles over half the restaurant by herself. She's always quick to smile and joke and always remembers her regulars...drinks and food. How many in this industry bother to do that? The managers are usually quick to step up to help too which is very cool to see. Happy hours can get crazy, but your patience will be rewarded if DJ is working that nightThis month's promo is $7.99 burgers...and the All American Standard is the one to get..onions bacon pickles in the burger then grilled to yum-town. Second fave is the Chicken Wonton tacos!! Totally delicious even without the slaw on top."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge Applebee's guy, but a new one just recently opened about five minutes from my house in Murrysville.  The atmosphere in the new restaurant is clean and nice for taking the family out for a meal with their murrysville themed decor.  We did the 2 for 20 and started with the spinach artichoke dip which was great.  I ordered Fiesta Chicken which was enjoyable and my wife ordered baby back ribs which she also said she liked."}
{"text":"9WORST EXPERIENCE ever in the SOUTH SIDE.  Where to begin? The appetizers never came before the meal. They actually arrived an hour late with the rest of the orders. We had to keep asking somebody to refill our drinks.  Other families where seated after us and received their before us, and left before us. The chicken was not fully cooked or the wings, for that matter. I truly believe they forgot about us until we said something. I will never ever take my family out to eat at this establishment waste of my time and money for the horrible service.  Customer Service like this is what gives the SOUTH SIDE a bad name."}
{"text":"worst food and service Ive ever recieved!!! Waitress were extremly rude and food tasted like it was spoiled will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I have had better days at this place. Last visit was for happy hour- the bartender tried to charge me full price for a drink and when I said something she responded like it was my fault that she misunderstood me and had to remake my drink. The attitude was not appreciated."}
{"text":"Another Monday night and K was jonesin for a burger. Applebee's here we come. We were greated by the hostess who took us to a table. Our server was Raymond. He was awesome. Spot on, got the job done. Wasn't intrusive and carried on a conversation when appropriate. Kudos. C got the Classic Burger w/ Cheese and pickles on the side. ($6.99 Monday). The patty was a perfect medium, the cheese was ooey gooey melted good stuff. He ended up with 17 pickles on the side. Nice. C gave it a double thumgs up. K ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger ($6.99 Monday). Again, the patty was a perfect Medium Rare, the Swiss was completely melted and there were a lot of mushroom slices. K said this was one of the best burgers she has had here. I ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday). This is my favorite burger. And tonight, it was done as well as it can be. The sunny side up egg was perfect. When I sliced through it the yolk ooozed down over the hash brown. The patty was a perfect Medium Rare, seasoned just right. OMG I love this burger. Spot on tonight. I do have to note that in the past the fries were unlimited, as per the commercial on TV. Evidently there was a lot of grief about it and so according to the manager, no more unlimited fries with the Monday night $6.99 Any Burger special. Really, no big deal because none of us really wanted or needed any more fries. Our drinks were $2.49 which is totally fair. Great Service. Great Monday night Burger special. Great Food. Great Prices. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"K and I had just dropped C off for rehearsal and because a storm was headed for the valley we decided to duck into Applebee's for the great Monday night burger deal. Our server was Candy and she was really very pleasant. She did a great job of being around when we needed her but was not suffocating. K and I both ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday only). We both loooooove this burger. It is my favorite burger from Applebee's. They sear bacon and onions into the patty and then top it with crispy hash browns, a fried egg, American cheese and ketchup (which I omit). K gets the burger with the ketchup and we both ordered it medium rare. Candy brought us our drinks and our burgers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered chips with mine and K had ordered fries with hers. Both burgers were a bit overcooked. Not enough to send them back, but enough to lessen the ooowee goooey goodness. On both the fried egg was also a bit overdone. I love this burger because I want to cut into or bite into the egg and have it ooze all over the hash browns but both these eggs were past the runny stage. Bummer. The funny thing is the hash browns could have been cooked a bit more. They need to be crispy. Not just because that's what's in the description, but because that's what works with this burger. However, since our eggs were not runny, it didn't really matter. The fries were also just o.k. Not done enough if you ask me. Fries by nature should be crispy. I'm not talking over fried but they have to have some tooth to the texture. These did not. The chips were ok. Nothing special. If the burger was cooked right, and the eggs were runny, and the hash browns were crispy and the fries were a bit more cooked I would give this visit a 4 Star because Candy was such a good server. But because the burgers were not I have to drop it to a 3 Star. Average. But... here's where this visit looses another star. These burgers are supposed to come with endless fries. When we asked Candy for another order, hoping that maybe the second order would be a bit crispier, she told us that the Monday night, $6.99 Any Burger Special did not come with endless fries.  Now, those who know me know I hate having to correct people when it comes to THEIR business. Both K and I knew that wasn't true so we asked her when the policy changed and Candy told us that one of the Manager's at this Applebee's told the employees that the $6.99 Monday burger deal did not come with endless fries. O.K. So I pulled up the Applebee's website and found the TV ad that showed free refills of fries with the $6.99 Burger. I showed the Ad to Candy and she went back to tell the manager. She came back with another order of fries and told us that \"this manager agrees with you\". In all of this, Candy was very pleasant and continued to apologize for how our experience was going. Agrees with me? It's on your f*&^#@# Television Ad. It's NOT my idea. I'm not making it up. Why don't the Managers know corporate policy and what's being advertised on TV? Wow. Great server, Average burger, crappy fries, manager without a clue. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"When it's late and everyone else has closed on a weekday, it's either a trip to Delux or a trip to here. When my wallet is weeping, this is the place to go. Their remodel is great and not so cluttered anymore, the place is always packed because the happy hour beer is cheap, service is able to keep up, and so far I haven't had any major qualms. Everything has been quite a good experience and the food is what you would expect from Applebee's. Not extravagant, but not absolutely horrible. Their sirloin choices are perfect for when I want to keep the calories as low as I can at an Applebee's (I really should be going to Sweet Tomatoes next door, but I lack self-control) and they give generous portions for everything."}
{"text":"Just horrible!!!! 1st time at this location. Ordered a sangria, which was good! My sister & I both ordered the bourbon street chicken. After waiting a while our food finally comes out. My sister's is perfectly cooked while mine us clearly burnt! I cut a piece off to see if it tasted burnt & it did. They threw a whole bunch of seasoning salt on top of the burnt chicken trying to hide the fact that it was burnt. I told the waitress ir was burnt & I'd like another. The waitress said she will send the manager over, 10 minutes go by still no manager so I asked the waitress where's the manager. She seemed surprised she didn't come over. Finally the manager comes over, not to apologize for serving me burnt chicken, but to tell me that they are making me a new one. I was very disappointed in how the manager handled the situation with no apology!! The waitress asked if the manager came over, I too her yes, but she didn't do anything or apologize. So a little later the manager comes back over to apologize. I would not look forward to returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Applebee's is a chain restaurant that you can find almost anywhere. They do offer lunch specials during the week which are smaller portions but you can pair two items and save money. Each time I visit I'm greeted at the door and made welcome.  I normally order the French onion soup and pair it with a salad and it works quite well for me. They do serve it with a bread-stick which I always enjoy Service is good and waitress attentive.   They do offer a full size menu and of course there is a bar menu. They have free Wi Fi available and manage to make your visit enjoyable.  It's a good place to stop if you're traveling or just want to stay on a budget."}
{"text":"Applebee's is a chain restaurant found around the country. The service is friendly and now they have added to your table a machine where you can play games, answer trivia questions, or add to your order. There is a slight fee for the two former items so you would swipe your card in order to use it.  I normally come here during the week when they have lunch specials. You get a choice or soup, half sandwich or half salad of the ones listed.  I normally order the French onion soup along with the Chinese chicken salad. Although it comes fried you can request it grilled and you get a small breadstick to go with it.  It is a smaller portion than regular size for the same items but since I don't eat a whole lot I find it to be enough. Food is okay. Prices are reasonable.  They have another option when you come at other times for a 2 party sharing meal which is listed on the menu.   On this particular visit I noticed a young boy was celebrating a birthday so a group of waiters came gave him a small dessert and sang to him. Desserts are also reasonably priced but not overly big.  I stop here when I want a change of pace and want to save a few dollars on a lunch."}
{"text":"I used the curbside togo last night, and I must admit, I was impressed. My wait time was very minimal; the order was correct; everything was hot and fresh; and the server I dealt with, Antonio, I believe, was phenomenal! This help make up for a previous bad experience that I had there."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoy coming here to visit Lonnie who bartends.   Wonderful service, professional and super fun."}
{"text":"Busy location. Service was decent but getting the bill was slow...  (Imagine that). My friends meal was poor quality, burnt in some areas and undercooked in others. My friend didn't ask for a new meal but the manager came over and not only remade her meal but comped it. I think that is excellent service. My meal was basic but good."}
{"text":"Great food drinks and atmosphere. Me and my fianc√© love to go here on date nights and before going to the movies. One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I went there on 3/4/16 to eat there with my friend around 10:30 pm. We ordered chips and salsa, chicken wrap and bone-in wings. When the food came out, the waitress brought boneless chicken so I let her know that the order was wrong. She took the food away, said she'll have it corrected and will have the food out right away. By the time my bone-in wings came out, my friend was finished eating. I ate 3 pieces of chicken, the next piece I picked up was COLD. It was also very slimy. I set the chicken on the plate and scraped the sauce with the fork just to see that it was a RAW PIECE OF CHICKEN tossed in barbecue sauce with the rest of the wings... when I brought this to attention, they took the food away immediately and offered to make new. I was totally grossed out at the fact that I had eaten food that was contaminated with raw chicken... I told them I did not want anymore food. THIS WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE. I WILL NEVER EAT AT Applebee's AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"After experiencing a great rib dinner INSIDE this restaurant a couple weeks before, the wife and I decided to do their \"Curbside To Go\"...big mistake... we had one of their new pasta dishes...incredibly poor...a splash of sauce, a dash of chicken, and pasta . We could have done better with something from a cardboard box that you get at the supermarket for $1.79.  Mine wasn't much better...can't even remember what it was, it was that memorable (not).  Bottom line...IF you decide to go to Applebees, DON'T get Curbside To Go...at least if you're inside, they can take it back and make you something different or get your money back."}
{"text":"I think that most everybody knows what they're getting into when they go to an Applebee's, but I think that the concern is at what end of the spectrum does THIS location run at.  The service here was great, and the food was done just right. Nothing was over or undercooked. The flavors were distinct, and the drinks were cold.  I took my grandma here for lunch while I was visiting town, so I have no previous experience at this location to base my experience on. However, it is a rarity that  you find a server these days who will patiently wait to be addressed so as to not interrupt a good conversation, especially in the fast paced world of the western USA and in Las Vegas for that matter.  Our server was very very polite, astute, and courteous. It was a very enjoyable, casual lunch.  Two thumbs up! (and probably 4 if I could vote for my grandma)"}
{"text":"Went on Friday at 5pm with wife and daughters.  Food arrived cold and took 40 minutes. - burnt fish and pasta.  Service was pretty poor and didn't see the server for ten mi.urea after we sat down.  Needed to ask the manager is anybody was workingthis section."}
{"text":"So came here for lunch with the BF since he never tried Applebee's. I haven't been to one in 2-3 years. I was reminded why I stop going, the menu sucks. Anyway we got our appetizer within 8 min then we got our food 10 min later. I got the new pineapple burger which was mostly just meat and bread could hardly taste anything other than that. And it was soooo small. My bf got the mushroom Swiss LUCKILY he saw a long hair strand stuck in the cheese before he took a bite! GROSSSS! We sat there 10 min before our waitress finally came back so we had to wait another 15 min so they can remake his burger that time I didn't want my burger so we just took them both to go. Took about 7-10 min to finally check out. Also I believe the manager past by us and didn't bother saying anything or ask us how we were, If I seen a couple one with food and the other without food I would of asked if they were okay but nope she just walked pass us but checking on other tables before and after us! Anyway what a waste of time and money. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"We went at lunchtime on a Friday. The food was delicious, service was awesome, and atmosphere was great. The only downside: we heard employees talking negatively about a coworker. I get it, you don't always like everyone you work with, but it's so unprofessional to speak about a coworker in such a manner when customers can clearly hear everything you're saying!"}
{"text":"Was there on Friday night Jan 12.  Received a gift card for Christmas so my husband and I went..  we were seated in a booth in the bar.  The service started out fine but went down hill very quickly.  I ordered French onion soup and the Mac n cheese with chicken, my husband orders the all u can eat riblets ... I never received my soup and when the food arrived, the server dropped the plates and noticed we didn't have silverware, I mentioned I didn't get my soup... she said \"I'll check on that for you\"... she never came back... I sat there for a good 3 or 4 min before I got up and went to the bartender and asked for silverware... our sever never checked on us to ask how was our meal.. The riblets were burnt , my husband ate them anyway... my water glass sat empty half way thru my meal, never refilled.  I used that stupid computer on the table to pay and requested a printed receipt.  Guess what?  Had to wait for that .. the light blinked for a min then stopped... thought ok, he knows we want a receipt... umm no, had to wave him down to get it... just such poor service!!! There was not a manager to be found out in the dining room checking on guests.  You best believe I would have said something.    I am in the service industry as well and it kills me when I receive horrible service.. cuz I know the job.    We won't be back."}
{"text":"Well, when you have half a restaurant empty for seating but still have to wait 30 minutes to be seated on a 15-20 min wait apparently, well, seems inexcusable. Umm ok? I dont understand why you would want everyone waiting in the waiting room for a table when there are at least 8 tables open and free. Staff seemed nice. Our waiter timothy was great & attentive. Pasta was a little off but not too bad. The utensils, well, I've never seen a sloppier job in my life! Wow. Anyways, besides the wait that should've been avoided, timothy saved the day & changed the mood. Thanks! Id recommend better management and to stop standing around talking to each other as if there wasn't any work to be done. Happy Holidays."}
{"text":"I knew it was too good to be true, went back and got the Applebbes I remembered, crappy cheap food that tastes like ass. Service was fine, but I remember now why I skip chain bullshit food."}
{"text":"I know it's my fault for going to Applebees and hoping to get a steak cooked the right way I ordered medium rare 8 oz sirloin and they brought me a a medium steak more on the well-done side definitely try to offer to correct it but I've had experience so not sending food back if you order steak error definitely go at least two under what you like but the meat was season perfectly just over cook for my liking."}
{"text":"I love the food at Applebee's so I won't give it one star but the lady in the to go has a bad attitude (she has a mini red fro) she wasn't pleasant over the phone I almost ordered at another Applebee's instead because of that then I waited 10 min on her to get my food and figure out what sauce I asked for.   She has a poor demeanor and should be explained how customer service works. Honestly I'll never order Togo from this location again and I may not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Hi,   I don't know why People is not giving a good review!! It doesn't make sense! It's the best staff ever.. I love them all.. I wish Natasha was a server. She always smiles at customers faces. I like the mangers there too.. also the bartender Mike and Kyle, they will take care of you every time you go there. Frank is the best manger you can have.  It's really great staff! Hire Natasha to be the server at the tables :) we all want her!   Rakan,"}
{"text":"Not extremely happy with the service or the condition of the sliverware. I had to ask for a cup of hot water so I could clean my knife and fork. I tried really hard to be as discreet as possible, as to not bring attention. My server was multi-tasking, however when I was ready for my bill, she was busy having a personal conversation with another employee (a pretty long one I might add). She came over to check on me, but not really checking on me. I switched out regular fries for sweet potato fries, but she never told me it would be extra. Not that big of a deal, but it would have been nice to be informed. Don't think I will go back to visit that one."}
{"text":"I go here every so often and every time the food is great! I love them for their 2 for 25$ menu. You can't beat it. I was here yesterday and Rayna was our server and she was amazing!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time.  Never thought Applebee's would be so good.  The new Sriracha Shrimp are fantastic.  BBQ-ish, spicy,  fried perfectly.  The Pub Philly with extra grilled jalape√±o was another hit. If you get fries, get the BBQ dust on them or on the side.  Best part was their in house made spicy cucumbers.  Pickles gone WILD! If you sit at the bar, see Nucc. He's great."}
{"text":"Don't get to go orders/car side unless you love only having half of your order and it being wrong. Been to this locations maybe 2 times over a two year period I haven't ever had a order right."}
{"text":"If you hate your job why work there?   Probably won't be going to Applebee's  anymore, I've given this place too many chances and it only gets worse with time. Prices went up and portions went down.  The bartender did not seem happy to be there at all. I've worked in the service industry for 3 years (and still do) and I know that no matter how bad your night maybe you put on a damn smile and be friendly, or at the least attempt to be.   I know what is annoying to wait staff so I try to be an easy customer. I knew it was happy hour because that's why we went and I like the happy hour drinks, did not receive the happy hour menu that says what food/drinks were on happy hour, fine whatever, didn't ask for it. Got a drink that I knew, from previous trips, was on happy hour.   Got an appetizer did not receive silverware or napkins. Whatever fine. They also changed it so the pretzels no longer come with cheese and mustard so I had to ask for the other side, which I got an attitude like I was being bothersome (I ask politely and always say thank you). Again whatever.  Got the Thai shrimp salad (sub shrimp for chicken.) This is when we got silverware. Got the salad and I stared at it for a minute, noticing the large bowl but very small amount of salad. See the picture on the menu? Cut that amount in half, that's what you get. It was premixed lettuce/carrot/cabbage, like what you find in the veggie section at Walmart, with edamame beans and the smallest amount of dressing I have ever seen, literally just a drizzle of dressing on top. I ask for a side of dressing. I kept looking at it wondering why the salad appeared different from what the picture was when I ordered, well I looked on the Applebee's online menu, out of pure irritation, it was also supposed to have crunchy wonton noodles, almonds, and cilantro, which my salad did NOT have. How do you miss THREE main parts of the salad?!  Asked us how we were after our food was done.    At this point I'm just kind of over being there. He was probably the most unfriendly bartender I have ever experienced, you shouldn't feel like your bothering a server when asking for something, that is there job and why you tip, for the service. We still tipped the normal 20% purely based off of being in the industry, not because he deserved it."}
{"text":"In the words of Sulu, oh my.  Dirty, drinks sub par; my martini was horrible and I can't wait fir my food order.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I had emailed a very detailed review to the email on my Applebee's receipt over a week ago, still no response, so now it goes on YELP. This was the worst Thanksgiving Dinner/meal I've ever had.  We took my mother last year to this same location, it was $14.99, wonderful, tasty meal.  This year it was $11.99 (which I didn't find out until we walked in) this should have been a tipoff.  The turkey was chopped up, re-heated and dried out, the stuffing (at least I think that's what it was) was 2 small ice-cream scoops of glop, the mashed potatoes were okay, the green beans were okay (a bit garlicky), and instead of cranberry sauce (get this) there were about 7 chopped/dried cranberries sprinkled throughout the plate.  The gravy consisted of a few drips and drabs here and there.  I cannot believe the chef here would take the time to serve this crap for a Thanksgiving meal. A better meal would be served to the homeless...no kidding.  Well, I could go on how the servers looked like they were ready for a football game (wearing their jerseys) instead of last year how they were nicely dressed and FRIENDLY greeting at the front door.  If you're not going to serious about serving a special meal, don't bother at all. BTW, I would have paid even more than $14.99 for something quality, befitting what one would expect for Thanksgiving. If you dine at this location other than a Holiday meal, it is good. (see, something positive)  We occasionally eat here with my Mother who lives just down the street."}
{"text":"If you asked my daughter where she wanted to eat 7 days a week, for 6 of them she would say Applebee's.  (The 7th she would say CiCi's).  As always, they were consistent.  The service was fast and the food was good.  Even my son, who recently started his broody teenage years, had good things to say about his meal.  And that doesn't happen often.  Applebee's will always be on our list of dinner options that work for all 4 members of our household, and that list is not very long."}
{"text":"Ok, it's been a while since I've been to any Applebee's (6+ years) but I think it will likely be longer before I go back again.  I brought my niece who was visiting Phoenix with her husband and kids figuring it would be easy for everyone to find something on the menu they could enjoy.  Things started out fine with the service and we ordered some appetizers.  Food order was taken and we were enjoying our visit.  It wasn't very busy but yet a different waiter brought out the first few dishes of lunch and asked \"who had the shrimp?\"  Several of us ordered a shrimp dish but my niece said \"I had the wait watchers shrimp.\"  \"Ahhh, this must be yours then\" said the waitress.  After a few bites my niece realized it was not the shrimp dish she ordered.  The remaining plates had still not arrived and we explained to the waitress the error when she delivered the remaining plates.  We asked for a new meal to be prepared for my wife and she left with the plate.  Now this is where it gets good.    Our waiter then comes back to our table with the original dish that my niece had eaten from and proceeds to place it in front of my wife saying \"this one's yours, right?'  We agreed that was what she ordered but that my niece had been mistakenly served the plate and had taken a few bites from it.  His response????  \"That's ok, your all family right?\"  He seemed shocked we asked to have a fresh plate created.  Family or no family that is quite an assumption to be made!  My wife had never met this part of my family and being a registered nurse has a little thing about proper preparation, etc of food.  Wow, was all we could say.  He reluctantly went to the kitchen and 10 minutes later returned with a fresh (hopefully) dish.  Food was ok but nothing to get us to overcome the odd service."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this one is unusually better than the rest.  We have never had a bad service here and they waitstaff has always been attentive and pleasant.  Our drinks are always filled, my children always looked after and the food has always been great.  They have a private lot and the atmosphere has always been nice.  Even the bathrooms are clean and neat.  I can't complain!"}
{"text":"What can I say about a chain place?  I've never had bad service here and they are always very helpful with my kids and food we order for them."}
{"text":"Very clean, neat with friendly service.  This place is always busy, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a seat and most the time, I get seated right away.  Has a decent sized lot with parking all around.    I've never had a problem with food or staff and more or less prefer coming to this Applebees over some others in the area."}
{"text":"Like most Applebee's the menu doesn't change, but the atmosphere is good here.  Clean, neat and always in order, I've never complained about the bathrooms here or table neatness.  The staff has always been helpful and friendly.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"So being in Las Vegas for 3 years now, I am become accustomed to over the top customer service at restaurants.  Well, the found was the same as it should be at any apple bee's but the service was not up to par as I am use to from being from the Philadelphia, PA market. My male server was not personable, nor was he attentive at all.  Awaiting for over 15 minutes for refill, and 20 extra minutes to see if we wanted anything after our main course.  Since I knew the type of food I was going to be getting, it was good."}
{"text":"I stop here a couple times a month to pickup food to go. Very friendly when they come out to my car. Tasty food."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've tried this restaurant/ bar. Gave it a valiant chance. Again the bartender sucks. Pours the wrong beer after waiting. Wasn't offered a menu right away and was on her phone. Guess they don't have a training program. They should invest in one. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The server was nice and helpful that is the only reason why I gave 2 stars but lets talk about the shit** bartender that acted like my black a** wasn't sitting there! Not one time did she come over and ask did I want a glass of water or anything nor come over and ask was I ready to pay NOTHING! Racism is alive and well at this establishment...the bartender was named \"Val\"....remember all customers of all colors should be welcoming! What really pissed me off is the server gave my tip to her non serving unfriendly a**."}
{"text":"The burger I had was fantastic. The waitress was nice and friendly and she moved very quick. This Applebee's seems to be very customer oriented because they have little tablets at the table for games, menus, ordering and even paying for you food. They also have these cute little booklets that they drop your check off in when you get your food incase you're in a hurry. I felt a little rushed by this because we had just received our food but I guess I can understand people on their lunch breaks wanted to get out as soon as possible. Their $5.99 burger Monday is incredible!!"}
{"text":"This place was a disaster. My table was dirty and might I add I waited 35 minutes for a fucking appetizer. My classic combo was cold as shit. I told the manager about the problem and he disregarded the fact that I was not satisfied and gave me attitude. Would not recommend. I had to rate this shit hole to write this post but it's a shit shack. 0/10"}
{"text":"At first, we really enjoyed our meal and drinks then the server told us that both she and her manager think \"we've had enough to drink\" and debated on giving us another shot after only 3 margaritas. I'm a grown woman and definitely know when I can and cannot take any more alcohol. I came out to have a fun, casual night at dinner and that ruined it. The server was so sweet and very attentive, but that comment really ruined our experience. If they're going to cut off their customers after only a couple drinks, I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The week day day manager is as rude as I've ever seen. Someone needs to teach him some social skills. Wish I had gotten his name but certainly won't be back again."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Free wifi."}
{"text":"Just had the bourbon steak, was awesome. Nice relaxing atmosphere for lunch.  Then Hank walked in.  He was being very loud, and I believe he was already intoxicated. He started yelling about a college football game.  The only time he wasn't yelling was when he was stuffing his face with food. Everyone was sickened by his behavior. I recommend Applebees. I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"This location has really gone down hill  Waiting to be seated even though the place is not busy .  Ordered a steak and salad.  The steak was so tough it could hardly be chewed  Salad came with onions and tomatoes after we asked for no tomatoes or onions  The mashed potatoes are powdered potatoes .  The least they can do is make sure there mixed well.  We had the potatoe  flakes in our mashed potatoes that were not mixed well.  Will not be going back"}
{"text":"My intention was to get back to Sweet Tea's today, but they are closed on Sundays. So, being in that area, my Mother wanted the Chinese Chicken Salad at Applebee's, one of her all time favorites. Not being a true fan of chains, I agreed. And, I was very impressed. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and fresh! I also really enjoyed their seasoned fries. My Mom enjoyed her salad as well, and the staff was attentive throughout the entire meal. Shocked, yes, but happy I said yes."}
{"text":"Ahhh Applebee's...or should I say \"Crapplebee's.\"  I have noticed not only with this location, but all the others I have been to as well.  This was one of my favorite childhood restaurants but the quality is seriously declining over the past few years.  Everything tastes like it was frozen or came out of a box and reheated.  The service is atrocious.  Lots of trashy clientele doesn't help either.  I doubt I will ever go to Applebee's again, especially this location.  This company blames millennials for putting them out of business, when really it's their own fault for serving crappy food.  Sad that I always looked forward to going here and now I can't look at this place without getting an upset stomach thinking about the terrible food lol"}
{"text":"Went there expecting a nice dinner date but that's not What  we got. It took forever for our food to come out and when it did the wings were cold. Our server was nice and did a good job but one of the managers kept walking around and he was very rude to the employees. This place used to be really good but they change their menu to often and the food and service has just gone downhill."}
{"text":"Typically I have have always had a mediocre experience at this Applebees. This time however was probably the worst I have experience so far. I do not expect much out of this location however anything worse then my typical experience is unacceptable.   Wait time: anytime I go it's usually between 5 and 6 so the wait time is usually always around 15 minutes. This time the wait time was the same but the greeter didn't even greet me with a Hello welcome to Applebees.  Instead I had to go up to her and ask her to put my name down.  Waitress: After being seated we didn't see our waitress for another 10 minutes.  This means we didn't even order our drinks yet. Finally when she made an appearance we gave her our drink order, ice tea and sprite. Took another 10 minutes.   Food: I get the same thing every time, steak and veggies. My 6 year old daughter got the 4 ounce steak from the kids menu. Medium rare for both of us. Took about 15 mins to get our food which was typical... but this time my steak looked like one of those processed steaks. Like the kind you buy in the bag at the grocery store precooked. It was done med well. My daughters 4 ounce steak, which looked like a small hockey puck,  was rarer than mine.  My steak tasted funny, I couldn't even finish it all. And it comes with seasonal veggies which happens to be broccoli,  ALL YEAR ROUND.  Half way through eating I was done with my ice tea awaiting a refill that never came. When we were done eating we waited for about another 15 mins for our waiting who I had not seen for at least 25 mins prior. I had to ask the buss boy to get her for me. My daughter really wanted desert and it was out date night so I agreed even though I just wanted to leave at this point. When our waitress finally came around I gave her the order we got the dessert soon after, and then we did some more for her to come back around so we could get the check. 10 minutes goes by again and she finally chose her face and asked if we want the check.   I did overhear her talking with the table behind us saying that she only started about a week ago, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to she was new. I still gave her a $5 tip on a 30 dollar bill only because of this reason.  All in all I do not think I will go to this location again not so much because of the experience I had with the waitress but more on the food was less than mediocre this time and I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"The server was extremely RUDE. I come here frequently with my friends and family but normally in the day time. I normally stay away from racial conversation but it was very apparent that she felt we were beneath her as she smirked when she answered questions and/or rolled her eyes. She was very unfriendly with us and even after I asked for a manager I asked that she not come back to our table. She then comes to the very next table (our whole row was empty) and began to find things to do with a smirk on her face as if she was taunting us. The manager did not take control of this situation, almost like she was in charge of him. He said I will take care of you guys insinuating the bill however when the bill came I asked about it and he said oh I usually wait for the customer to ask. Our bill was $90 with the game they tried to sneak and charge. When I inquired about it he said oh sometimes the kiosk accidently charges that. I wonder how many people have been charged and didn't look. He took the 1.99 charge off and for the bad service he gave us $6 OFF. I have never been so insulted in my life and as a retention manager who deals with the worst if the worst type of person daily I know first hand this is not the way you treat your customers. This is truly sad and I have never in 30 years been made to feel this way after I spent $100 in an establishment!"}
{"text":"So been here 2 days in a row. Chicken tortilla soup is great!!!  I ordered one of my favorites fajita chicken roll up.  But this time around I did the buy one get one.  My server was top notch on top of everything.  Great price, great atmosphere and smiles from all servers.  I will be back to get the bogo again it's a great price for a date friend or yourself:)"}
{"text":"I had about the worst burger of my life here. Worse than mcdonalds. Worse than the company cafeteria. Just bad."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!  Julia ( not even sure if that's her real name) was about 70 years old and seemed miserable in her job.  My sister stayed here about 3 hours for soup and salad.  The manager on duty was even worst  attempting to appear busy in the back??!! The waitress was irritated about the church down the street did not inform them they were having a event so they were busy.  Funny because we sat at the bar and I am very sure the Catholic Church goers were not having dinner in the bar.  The amount of time if has taken me to write this the waitress has not come to collect her money and is losing tip money as we speak. In short this Applebee's is not a good spot to eat at if you have some place to be."}
{"text":"I use to be the biggest fan of Applebee's. Now a days it's a place to get a meal, but nothing spectacular here.   This particular location has some of the worse service I have seen in a long time. The staff just doesn't seem to care about catering to their customers. Unfortunately, the food - no matter how good it may be is hurt by the staff and how they service their customers.   Lunch- they have the best soups and salads! Especially the Shrimp and Spinach salad with the tomato basil soup.  Dinner - the steak are good, not great, but they are tastier and reasonably priced.  Hopefully the staff will soon get the message other wise I will look for a new location for Applebee's."}
{"text":"Have only been for lunch on 2 occasions.  Salad and soup was great but it took awhile to get it. Not sure that would be good if I worked!"}
{"text":"I eat here 3 or 4 times a year, lately the menu has improved try the woodfire steak with veggies, bacon cheese potatoes, good stuff. The staff are always courteous and attentive, I have never seen it overly crowded and never had to wait. It is family friendly with a variety of kid menu options."}
{"text":"Came here the other day, food was great and the server. My only bad experience was guy hostess in the front, he was very very rude and very unwelcoming. If he doesn't like interacting w/people he should find another job."}
{"text":"I dined here last night with my family, a group of three adults and four children, and being a late Monday night with an empty parking lot, around 8:30 pm, my hopes were up for a pretty good meal fairly quickly. Boy was I wrong. First problem was that we ordered appetizers including a soup and salad, along with some cheese sticks and burger egg rolls. ALL of the appetizers took more than 35 minutes to come out. Mind you, it's not busy and I had to ask the server to go ahead and bring out the soup and salad as that should not take so long to do. The server, Jessica was ok, although she did seem a little new considering the unsure look on her face in most of her interactions with us. She seemed to being doing what she could to get the food to come out and even let us know that she was simply waiting on it, confirming the absurd amount of time for apps to come out. We also ordered three kids meals, which she could have asked us if we wanted to come out early, but with the amount of time the appetizers took, I doubt they would have. The cheese sticks came out served with salsa, which mostly messed that up, but the soup and salad was fine. Once the dinner finally came out most of the food was tasty and hot but it was too long awaited to thoroughly enjoy. My biggest complaint about the whole night is that the manager NEVER came over to ask us how our meal was or let us know about the delay. I'm pretty sure she was standing beside our table behind the bar for the whole duration of our meal, but the sloppy way she was dressed led me to believe she, perhaps was a bar back or busser. All this said to point out that the management at this location is way below acceptable, especially on a slow Monday night. Being in the industry, I know many ways this manager could have remedied the situation and improved my guest experience, but she honestly didn't even seem to care."}
{"text":"The positives are that the service is great. We were seated quickly and our server was very friendly and helpful. Now the negatives...I feel like the menu options are very limited and the prices are too high for the type of food they serve. I find it strange that they do things like serve a dish with two grains and no vegetables, that they will exchange fries for a salad without telling you that it costs extra, that they only cook burgers rare or well, and that they only serve VERY large salads and no longer offer smaller portions. I used to be a huge Applebee's fan, but I do not like the changes that they have made in recent years. I won't be back...sorry guys."}
{"text":"It an applebees so not much i can say about the food...my dish was fine, but my friend hated her food! Our waiter was either being completely inappropriate or inattentive. Next time im in town i think i'll look for a different place to catch a quick meal with a friend."}
{"text":"I think I'm pretty neutral when it come to going to Applebees for dinner.  I don't love it and I don't hate it.  My parents live in the area, so it seems to be a somewhat regular place of theirs... which means I go there sometimes too.  I enjoy the atmosphere at Applebees.  I think it has a good family feel to it and seems like a great restaurant to bring kids to.  There are lots and lots of different, rather random decorations about the place that keep the children occupied and the adults talking.  Unlike Sapna G. I do eat meat, and I don't mind Applebee's menu all that much.  I wouldn't be able to tell you a favourite dish because each time I get something different... which means nothing stood out to me that much.  I'm serious when I say that I don't know if I love Applebees or hate it.  Let's just say that when my parents invite me to go, I don't cringe, I don't vomit in my mouth a little and I don't politely say, \"no thanks.\"  I nod my head and say, \"sure.\""}
{"text":"I wanted  to give  it half a star. Service bad my food looks nasty and blt sandwich  doesn't  look  very appealing .  Bad bad bad.. but im hungry  and and its freaking  hot outside .  So i don't  have a choice  but let  my  kids  eat  and get the hell out asap. Never  again  i wanna  set foot  in this place .  Makes all the other  Applebee's  look bad."}
{"text":"Check your bank statements after your visits here. Seems the servers don't mind tipping themselves. Left 20% in cash so the server wouldn't get taxed and she still added a tip for herself on the bill of 25%. I HOPE SHE KNOWS THIS IS ILLEGAL. Spoke to general manager who said to come back and he'll take care of it. Finally found time to drive from Glendale to find out all they wanted to do was say sorry and give me difference back. They're lucky I didn't report this to the BBB after the long drive I made in traffic trying to get to laveen by street. Hope this is helpful."}
{"text":"Really terrible experience. We waited about a half hour to be sat for a party of 4, which wouldn't be so bad If we didn't walk past 4 empty tables on our way to be sat. There were at least 6 open tables in the restaurant while we were waiting.   Our food took forever. Our appetizer came out with our meal and was cold. Our waitress was supposed to tell us about the gift cars deal which she did not, and the card on the table said if they forget they'd bring a free desert, and it never came.   Wouldn't return solely because the service was AWFUL. - Victoria Shaughnessy"}
{"text":"I had called the corporate number after I had been in this place last and told them about my bad experience with the food, service and the manager. I declined a gift card at that time figuring that I wouldn't try this place again, but last night I did. The place was stuffed with people because of happy hour and their specials. Got a waitress that was viably frazzled. We got the 2/$24 special. The appetizer was the spinach and artichoke dip and it was hot and delicious.The waitress came once to refill our drinks and apologised  for the delay because the kitchen was slammed.  Then we waited for over an hour for our main course while others seated after us were served. I was ready to leave when our dinners came to the table. I checked the french fries to see if they were hot and they were, but I then cut into the ribs and they were barely room temp. I told the waitress and she took them back and told me that the manager was coming over to talk to me.The manager told me that the order slip had been lost and she comp'ed the whole meal for us including our desserts. I do like their BBQ sauce Well I guess I will try this place again, but I don't have great hopes for this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy applebees but this one did not mix my perfect margarita correctly.   I drove 20 minutes so I could have my perfect and an decent meal to receive a bitter drink not mixed to the recipe and not measured correctly.   Consistency is everything."}
{"text":"we decided to go here after receiving a gift card for xmas.  I had sworn off Applebee's many years ago, but decided to try it again, it was free after all. The service was terrible, our server gave us all different drinks than what we had ordered?!?  We tried to play it safe with our menu choices.  I choose a bacon cheeseburger, my husband choose the chicken Caesar salad.  They were both lousy.  My hamburger tasted like someone spilled a container of salt on it then wiped it off, gross.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up a bacon cheeseburger, but it was just too salty and generic.  My husbands chicken Caesar salad was lousy also, nothing special to it, and the chicken didn't taste very good.  All the way through our meal, our server didn't come over and ask if our food was ok, we also sat there for a very long time without any drink refills through our meal.  It was a unpleasant experience, and if I ever get another gift card, I will be re-gifting it"}
{"text":"So I decided to come here at 8pm on 5/5/16 I should have known not too... absolutely the worst service ever nothing else needs to be said... everything about this place man...omg lmao you must get there and see for yourself"}
{"text":"Parking: Ample private lot Cleanliness: 4/5 Wait time: none for seating, 5 for drinks and 10-15 for meals Service: 3/5, friendly but not attentive Price: $$ $10-$20 per person Food quality: 0/5  Waitress (Misty) was friendly enough, but was not attentive to my party's needs. We needed to request menus & refills, and she did not bother to check if our steaks were cooked properly.   I had a sirloin (cooked medium) with broccoli & mashed potatoes. The steak was probably the most disgusting steak I've ever had in my life. First, it was just oddly shaped, and most of it was done rare/medium-rare, with a small portion well done. The texture and chew was really off, sinewy, fatty and reminded me of raw ground beef. The broccoli was practically raw and the mashed potatoes were cold; both unseasoned. The other person in my party who had a steak didn't have much to say about it but gave it 3/5 stars. Others ordered chicken tenders, pasta & a western bbq burger. The chicken tenders got a 3/5 stars, same with pasta. The burger itself was cooked okay and tasted fine, but he found the ciabatta bun to be more akin to sweet bread--something you'd get at a bakery. Everyone agreed that everything (especially the fries) were unseasoned. Our waitress pretty much avoided us after serving the food, thankfully they leave those digital paying things at every table so you can just get the hell out of there. Also, when leaving a tip on that machine they recommend 20%; ambitious.  I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wendy was our waitress and she was on top Of things!! Drinks never emptied not even my 6 year olds cup!!  The food was Awesome at this particular location!! Applebee's food is usually pretty good. I love their handmade burgers!! Always so good!! The facility is clean and nothing is falling apart!! The bathrooms are clean!  The hostess was very friendly and welcoming!!  We enjoyed our visit!!"}
{"text":"I have always like Applebee's. The hamburgers are always so fresh tasting and good.  This particular location was clean, had very friendly staff, service was quick and we came during lunch time and our food was fantastic."}
{"text":"We are arrived around 7 o'clock at night our server was Aneshia. The whole restaurant was empty Aneshia had about maybe two other tables in her section, absolutely no excuse for the most poor/inattentive service I have ever received. We had to wait 5-6 minutes for her to bring out a kids apple juice.  Did not receive straws  Received no plates for our appetizer, she walked past all three of us sharing boneless wings off of a small tin tray.  Had to ask the host to get us ranch, plates and a straws after waiting  forever.  I ordered a medium rare steak as my entree I received a near well done steak I sent the steak back and by the time I received my steak both of my sides had got very cold and everyone else was finished eating and had lost my appetite by that time.  She checked on us a total of 3 times during the whole 1 hour and 30 minutes we dined in.  She did not bring a printed receipt  Half way through the meal our drinks were empty   She did not offer a refill once.  This was the most absolute worst experience I have ever had dining in  Especially since I work at a Applebee's here local, serving.  She did not follow the Correct procedures when it comes to greeting a table & getting drinks to the table in a certain  time frame.  You are also suppose to refill drinks before the meal comes out  FYI  If it wasn't for the ted machine I wouldn't of known she charged full price for a kids 99 cent meal Tuesday.   Needs to be retrained by a neighborhood expert.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I can't say it was the best steak I ever had, you know that melt in your mouth cuts like butter type of goodness. Nope, notta, just not that great sorry. If you must chew on meat more than 10 seconds something isn't right! Ha- the veggies and baked potato was good but I left a lot of the steak on the sidelines. Maybe I should try a chicken dish next time? Prices are high but just about anywhere you want to park your bum and be served it's going to hit you hard now-a-days unfortunately."}
{"text":"The food was terrible, and service was terrible. We were charged for food that we were never served nor ever ordered."}
{"text":"On the appetizer they had to go thru a whole process of asking the manager and being rude of me just wanting half buffalo and half bbq wings when I've done that every time . They said they won't do it anymore rudely . I am not coming here next time"}
{"text":"I'll give the pros and cons. Pros- delicious half price wings all day on Thursdays    - clean restaurant    - nice staff Cons- charge for everything like ranch  when they don't tell you   But I mean this Applebee's is pretty good :) The WORST Applebee's to go to is the one on Higley and brown ... Never go to that one :) hope this helps"}
{"text":"I don't eat much, so I ordered the French Onion soup which was delicious. I also ordered mashed sweet potatoes. Applebee's, sweet potatoes and yams are two DIFFERENT things. Your menu said sweet potatoes and you served yams."}
{"text":"We venture to applebees at least once a week. Most of the time it's during happy hour.  We have a couple favorite servers who take good care of us and all the managers know us.  Food is ok, nothing to get excited about.  We like the limited happy hour menu with boneless wings, spinach dip & wonton tacos all half price from 3 - 6.  Also half price beers and long islands & margaritas.  We 3 shared the kicker turkey sandwich with siracha slaw.  Sandwich could have used more turkey as it was really a slaw sandwich and the bottom toasted piece of potato bread was soggy."}
{"text":"Food is decent but for me there's not enough. Atmosphere is nice but might be hard to find because of the hide target next to it. If I had to rate it I would give it a 7/10."}
{"text":"Have never been a big fan but we had a gift certificate so my husband and I went for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised. Serve was fun and helpful. A special menu listing calories had good options and I tried the lemon chicken. Delicious! Husband had a home cooked type dinner. Prices reasonable. We will go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to share my wonderful experience at Applebee's the other night, we had a long night at school so we decided to grab late dinner. Our waitress was Evelyn, she was the absolute best! We grabbed a few pi√±a coladas with an extra shot apparently the shot was an extra 6 dollars! She was nice enough to notify us before making them just Incase we changed our mind, we didn't mind at all but we sure appreciated her letting us know. It was a busy night our food took some time but in all honesty it didn't bother us, mainly cause she was just so professional with the way she treated us and made us feel so welcomed. I enjoyed my very expensive pi√±a colada & meal gave her a very nice tip because it's hard to find service like the one she showed that night. I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend, my first time. Was treated with exceptional service. The bartender is very professional and awesome. Friendly, and the artichoke dip is to die for! Mmm!!"}
{"text":"Linda Evans is such an outgoing General Manager!!!!!!! Very welcoming and service was excellent... Food comes out as it looks and is described in menu... Will be back..."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! Dont go to this location, dirty as can be, this place needs a make over or update to say the least. Ghetto crowd, OMG cold food bad drinks, nothing good but the good intentions of the server (Ben) he was the only good in between all the horrible experience."}
{"text":"I give it three stars simply on the service.  Nice folks and attentive.  Truthfully I am not a fan of Applebee's food is meh and honestly I have to look at the menu a million times before I settle."}
{"text":"I like Applebee's. It's my wife's favorite restaurant. I go for we go there. You get two entrees and an appetizer to split. Tonight we got the 2 for 20. Mine was the quesadilla burger, hers was the chicken tenders. The order came with French fries. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with nacho chips. As always the dip was good. Creamy and smooth, almost want to just eat it with a spoon good. I ordered the quesadilla burger which was my first time ordering this. This is a hamburger wrapped in a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese. The burger was cooked perfectly to my specifications. It was sandwiched in a quesadilla composed of melted cheese, Pico de Gallo. and grilled flour tortilla. It was a good burger. The only thing that would have made it a 5 star burger would have been chipotle or taco seasoning on the burger. As it was it was a little bland. I got some Tabasco to spice it up a little. The fries were crispy not soggy. I hate soggy.  The service was excellent. It was a full house tonight and Samantha was right there servicing out table as if we were the only ones there. The restrooms were clean and well maintained. This one is a keeper in my book giving it a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for Mother's Day. The staff was friendly enough, we were seated right away, and had drinks brought out pretty quick.  The food though, it's Applebee's - expect mediocrity and you won't be disappointed. However, sometimes, they still manage to disappoint.   Their fish and chips is nearly $13.00 for three small chunks of fish and a small order of fries. Not worth it at all. The steak was a bit tough and not that flavorful.   For pre-prepared food, heated to order, it isn't horrible, but not really good either.  You get what you deserve going to Applebee's."}
{"text":"It was decent.  Not great, but not bad.  I was there around 4:30pm on a Monday night.  Just late enough that there were no lunch people there, and just early enough that the dinner crowd wasn't there yet.  So the place was empty.  This can sometimes be bad for service, because they can be short on servers, but ours was great.  We ordered the pretzels and beer cheese appetizers.  The \"pretzels\" were more like big breadsticks, but were awesome.  It would be better if the pretzels were about half the size and less greasy, but that may be asking for too much.  The cheese, although tasty, was a weird consistency.  It wasn't really melty enough and was a small portion.  I was so starving that I didn't care.  My Mom had the cheeseburger with fries.  She asked for it medium rare and the server even confirmed \"with a little pink?\" However, when it came out, it was WAY over cooked.  She said it was still OK though.  I had the french dip.  It was pretty small, and there was not a lot of meat on the sandwich.  There was also supposed to be some sort of horseradish sauce on it, which I failed to find.  The side of au jus was tiny, and there was barely enough to use to dip my sandwich into.  I didn't really like the flavor of the meat and I couldn't find myself ordering it again.  The fries were good, but I didn't eat many of them.  Our server was very friendly and checked on us often.  We were in and out pretty quickly and there were no issues with our bill.  A pretty standard visit to Applebee's.  I didn't come here expecting a 5 star meal, and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a large chain restaurant, and nothing spectacular, so I can not give more than 3 stars.  My Mom and I dined here while out shopping on a Tuesday night.  It was more crowded than I expected, but we were seated in a booth right away.  Our server approached us immediately to take our drink orders.  It didn't take long to decide what we were getting (we did the 2 for $20 menu).  We shared the spinach and artichoke dip, which was scorching hot when it came out.  It took a few minutes before we could even get near it.  It was also served with a HUGE amount of tortilla chips, which don't really seem proportionate to the actually dip, but whatever, it was delicious.  My Mom ordered the 3 cheese chicken penne pasta, and I had the 7oz sirloin, but was talked into upgrading to the 9oz steak.  My Mom was not impressed with her pasta, although I tried it and thought it was tasty.  My steak was well seasoned and cooked medium rare, as I asked.  It was a bit tough, but that is to be expected with a sirloin.  The baked potato was a little undercooked, but I really didn't notice once I added the butter and sour cream.  The veggies were also a bit undercooked, the carrots were really hard.  Anyhow, Adam was a good server, he checked on us just enough and everything on the bill was accurate."}
{"text":"If you want some awkward service and to wait forever for your food definitely come here and ask for Dewan G. To be your server.  Not only did I have to tell him multiple times we weren't ready to order because our party wasn't present, I also had to repeat myself saying I didn't want another lemonade, just water.  The best part was when everyone but the pregnant lady and the three year old got their meals. Then had to wait another half hour for the food. The Mac and cheese never came for the 3 year old, thankfully no tantrums came about.  We had to ask for water refills, a kids cup, napkins and forks multiple times.  And I loved how a pregnant woman got charged for a beer that was never ordered. Everyone else we came in contact with was nice and not awkward. I don't what so with this guy but worst server award."}
{"text":"I tried Applebee's for my first time with my boyfriend the other night. Service was okay, the food was pretty good but nothing special. We both got steaks and they weren't cooked the way we asked.  The red skin mash potatoes are really good though along with the Bahama mama drink . I will return to try some other items of the menu."}
{"text":"So apparently RMH went belly up and all the idiots in management positions within this company are about to reap what they sew. I feel bad for the servers and the cooks, management though not so much.  Have fun looking for a job!"}
{"text":"What can you say... It's Applebees. If you don't set your expectations too high you probably won't be disappointed. The service during my visit was prompt and pleasant. The cheeseburger sliders were good; they were no White Castle but then, nothing is. All in all, nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Good food Friendly service (only if they are not busy) I mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour"}
{"text":"This place is great to hang out during happy hour, 1/2 price appetizers and some drinks. Friendly crowd and service. The \"Sampler\" is the best with a couple beers."}
{"text":"Interesting time here at this Applebees.  Was unexpectedly layed over - after my plane was late and had to stayover for morning flight.  Hotel shuttle to shoppiong center.   Since hotel didn't have restauraant, we Sat at bar for apps and drinks. It was after 9, so happy hour was in effect.  Ordered 1/2 rack of ribs and sweet potatoe fries and daugther had boneless chile sauce wings.  The wings were way too saucy for her and my ribs although were tasty - had a lot of fat on them.  Loved the sweet potatoe fries...Mid way through our  meals customers started having disagreements that also distracted the manager, bartender, etc.  By the time we left, it was difficult getting service cause one customer monopolized the bartenders attention telling stories.   The drinks were well made and pretty good.  The atmosphere and the bar was kinda of strange, though."}
{"text":"I was never a big Applebee's fan but when I was younger my mother and I would always go to the Farmingdale multiplex to watch scary movies with her co-workers and then eat at the Applebee's right there so it holds a special place in my heart. However, I only ever went for 2-fer's or  1/2 price apps after 10pm after that and was never really satisfied with their food so I abandoned Applebee's for TGIF. Well, TGIF's are few and far between in Arizona (there's literally two) and for some reason, a lot of places I hated on the east coast are WAY better on the west coast so I decided to give Applebee's another chance. My husband and I had been going to one closer to my mouse and I loved that one, no complaints, so when we spotted this location the other day while driving around, we gladly stopped in. This Applebee's is a little run-down. Our table was a little sticky and the leather seating had a big cut down the middle which irritated my legs. Our waiter was really friendly though, I told my husband he looked like an old-time Cowboy movie star and based on this piece of info alone, if you ever go to this location, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about, lol. My husband ordered the boneless wing appetizer as an entr√©e and I ordered the smallest sirloin they had with a size of fries (to give my husband) and a side of bacon macaroni and cheese.  Our food took a while to come out, especially for a Saturday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't particular busy, but we just played some games on the table kiosk so no big deal. I ordered my steak medium and it came out well down with some char around the edges. I wasn't going to say anything but I decided to just mention it to waiter since usually they stay around and have you cut into your steak to check the cook on it. He asked if I wanted to send it back which I declined because it had taken quite a while and then asked if I wanted to take a brand new one home. I accepted his order and he actually had the kitchen remake my entire order so I got a meal to take home. I was super surprised that he did that since I ate my macaroni and my husband and I devoured those fries.  He even had me cut into my steak before he bagged it up for me to take home. My husband said his wings were so-so and commented that he preferred the other Applebee's better which I do too but the service at this Applebee's is great. The manager came around to check on us as well as she was apologetic about the steak. Overall, we probably won't be back to this location because it's so out of our way but even though my first steak was off, they went above and beyond to fix the mistake and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Thursday evening around 7:55pm and It was so dirty when we came in. The entire bar was dirty and so we decided we'd go to a table and when the hostess came up she said \"you all can sit at the bar\" and we said \"we'd like to but it's so dirty with napkins and cups all over the place\" and she said \"oh well...I don't know if we have a clean table I can check...\" at that point we just walked out. Just dirty place and dirty workers. It's like everyone working there just rolled out of bed."}
{"text":"service is GREAT at the location ... No complaints at all. Servers are knowledgable about the menu and can answer any questions. I love the beer pretzels on the menu... Literally some of the best I've had around town. Cheap drinks. Best Applebee's in town."}
{"text":"Quite honestly one of the worst experiences I've had at an Applebee's. Food and drinks came out very slowly, ordered entrees and conversed in the meantime till we realized how much time had gone by. One of the waitresses finally approached us when we clearly looked like we were waiting on something and asked about it, said we were waiting on the food. Our waiter came out to tell us that he had forgot to place our entree orders... Made us question if we should wait or leave, but decided to wait to give this gentleman a bigger check. Entrees come out, mine had ketchup on it when it wasn't disclosed on the menu nor by the waiter.. Now if you're a picky eater, you know how crucial that is! I asked for another one without ketchup and by this point I'm over the whole experience. He noticed the frustration and mentioned how he would hook us up with a discount.. Ok, I see you're doing what you can, sure. Entree comes back out, this time bun on my burger wasn't broiled, egg was too cooked that the yolk didn't ooze over my burger how I wanted it to! Grr... Irritating. Waited for the bill, hoping there was a decent discount to make up for the experience, and when I got it I saw he took TWO dollars off of a $37 bill... $2? Great, that will buy me a soda    Honestly, service was so bad that I could have easily believed it was every employees first day.   Waiter (Josh) was very friendly, felt bad, might have definitely been new."}
{"text":"Typical Applebee's it is clean and the food has always been great. Take out or dine in, if your into the chain restaurants this is a good well managed one"}
{"text":"This was the worst Applebee's I have ever been to. On Wednesday april 25th a group of us 9 went for happy hour. We sat for over 30 min. There was only a few patrons in the restaurant and the bartender bought us water but told us he could not take our order that the waitress will be over. I spoke with the manager who apologized but didn't send a server over. She presented like she was not concerned. We eventually got a server who was great and did her best to make up for the incompetent staff. She had a photographic memory and got all of our order correct. To that waitress leave!!!! Your far to good of a waitress to work for a pitifully managed restaurant like that!! We'll never go back to this so called Applebee's and don't waste your time or $! Worst Applebee's ever!!!"}
{"text":"Applebee's 600 calorie menu is a good response to the Eat This/Not That criticism by Men's Health.  A good chain restaurant w/ something for everyone on its menu.  Service and prices are decent.  Noisy sometimes like a sports bar.  I like the drinks, riblets and portabella dishes."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night for dinner 5/25/18 Mom ordered chicken salad.  I ordered the steak med rare to rare with no mushrooms.   Arrived and looked quite pale as it turned out to be chicken.  Had to resubmit the order and wait.  By the time my food arrived mom was done so I quickly ate half and brought the rest home  Kinda ruined the dinner. As one was done eating and the other was just waiting.  Waitress was nice.  Oh well such is life."}
{"text":"I had such a great time out of the three times Ive been there, oh yea this was a first! And actually the servers in the past have been very rude and normally they all judge you before they even arrive to the table to ask for drinks! I server tables as well and I know that if I don't give a great customer experience a couple of thing could happen they won't come back, they won't tip accordingly and they would just tell others how much the service sucked!     Now our new server Amy she's a beast I give her 5 stars the only reason why I'm not giving a full five stars to Applebee's yelp is just because Applebee's will need to prove to me that they value customers! I'll be back but only if Amy can serve me!   FYI stake was good!"}
{"text":"I mean it's Applebee's, but as far as chain places go it's the best in my opinion. The happy hour specials are awesome ($3.50 20oz liquor drinks, can't beat that) and half off apps. Four bucks for a huge thing of spinach and artichoke dip is great.  The blue agave frozen margarita is delicious, as is their long island.  The two for 20 deal is great, I had the quesadilla burger which was quite nice. Get the flavors of Mexican food in a burger and with tortilla for bun you don't have all the extra bread to bog you down.  Our server was great the last time we went, we went at 11:30 on a Friday (they're open until 1am) and he didn't try and shuffle us out or anything, was attentive and quite nice. Will absolutely be back especially for happy hour and late nights."}
{"text":"Usually get the oriental chicken salad with fried chciken but decided to go with grilled chicken. Just as good if not better. Healthuer too. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I do not know if I will write something you do not know about this chain of restaurants, but I think by looking the reviews they just don't give a thought about the bad service you get here, obviously they're just for your money and nothing else,  What is the chance you get it wrong, TWICE,  I sent back my steak cs it was under cooked like medium rare, bloody and cold, I ask for medium well, server just didn't care, steak came back same way, just reheated, from this point on, server never came back,  Applebees, please, if you know that your customer service is low average, DO NOT ASK FOR 20%"}
{"text":"Poor service on a Sunday. Very slow. Many dirty tables. Wet table when seated. Poor response from waitress. Manager is disorganized. Steak overcooked. Juice for kids is in a box. Definitely headed in the wrong direction from the last time I was here. Never again!"}
{"text":"Back again happy hour 11-2 Thursday riblets all u can eat $1 magareta dam I love this place come see my girl Jennifur. P best waitress ever tell her buns send u"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have eaten at Applebee's. In the past, I found the food to be like an awful cafeteria experience. I had lunch there a couple of days ago and I was pleasantly surprised that the food quality has changed for the better. Applebee's stepped up their menu. I had the Cedar grilled lemon chicken garnished with Granny Smith apple relish. Topped with lemon olive oil vinaigrette over a blend of cranberries, rice, honey-glazed pecans & quinoa. My boyfriend had thePepper-crusted sirloin on a bed of hearty whole grains with sauteed spinach, fire-roasted grape tomatoes and portobellos, finished with a light broth. We were pleasantly surprised the food was tasty. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Didn't seem like such a busy night at the restaurant but we waited way too long just to place our order. Wine took a long time to come and so did my salad dressing when I asked for more. Also I'm 99.9 percent sure I asked for grilled chicken but got fried in my salad but it tasted good, so I didn't send it back. Anyway, they should 99.9 percent put more servers on if they know it's gonna be busy."}
{"text":"I came here and the waitress was making a big deal about not having refills on kids milk. I never asked about about refills on milk. so I was confused on that one. Food was ok, it was good. I would come back here but not for milk refills."}
{"text":"I love this location. I've dined in a few times, but I usually get my food carside to go on the way home. It's always ready on time, it's always correct, and it always tastes good. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Our food was kinda salty but we did like our salad and vegetables. Was to hungry to complain about the food."}
{"text":"Should have checked Yelp before coming, but was pressed for time and this was nearby. The table was not clean, the server, Dewan, so disinterested, and very sloppy, even as if on purpose. I will now appreciate it when a plate is placd on the table at the right angle, and when a cup of coffee isn't partially spilled over. I will not return."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be going to Applebee's again unless it was a guest's choice. This is mostly because of their 'Presto' automated ordering system.  I find it sad that these chains are now moving to this cold and impersonal ordering system. I like talking to my waiter/waitress, asking what they like, and just the whole personal experience. Maybe I'm weird in that way.  Oh and I also don't want to be advertised to while I'm trying to eat my dinner not play games for $.99 when I came to enjoy the company of the people I came with."}
{"text":"Applebee's is your regular american restaurant. looks like they have simplified the menu over the past couple years. everything looks pretty good, choices for every type of appetite.  always very friendly staff, we had great prompt service on a Sunday after church. had a party of 9 and we were sat right away without calling ahead.   ordered appitzers: boneless wings - normal breaded chicken bites, nothing special, but delicious( i recomend getting the honey pepper sauce! yum! pretzel pub sticks - they ususally are aweosme, but this time around they were gross! not cooked enough or something, was off the mark that day.  Food: 4-cheese mac with honey pepper chicken tenders - 3 people ordered this on at our table and everyone loved it. it's usually what i get here but wanted to try something else. i recomend this dish! its delicious mac and crispy tenders definitely satisfy and leave you wanting more chicken strips!  i had a crispy chicken breast on mashed potatoes and gravy topped with onion strings. it was fantastic, flavors all over the place delicious and savory. i w2ould get again.  wife had a steak - was way over cooked and tasted of burnt grill flavor - i don't think she would recomend getting it again.  we had a good experience. this was a good middle of the road not to pricey great place to have lunch. good for kids and the whole family."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had at an Applebee's. I ordered a car side to go order at a non busy time. I arrive at my a scheduled pick up time. I sit down in the chairs for the to go orders... 25 minutes passed and not a single staff even acknowledged I was there! Several saw me and passed by yet none stopped to ask about my order. I wait another 5 minutes before i get up and ask only to be told \"it's almost ready\"... She didn't even go back to ask about the order. This is 45 minutes after I placed my order, which was only one entree. I saw many of the staff packing their own meals to go but mine was still \"being made\" several others were on their cell phones. There were 2 other customers in the whole restaurant at the time and outside the one interaction in which I asked, no one bothered to say anything, great customer service.¬† No one offered a water or anything even though they clearly saw me pacing back and forth. Even the manager walked by without acknowledging. I finally received my food 1:15 hours after I ordered because it was waiting at the bar for 30 minutes yet no one bothered to tell me this not even the lady I asked several minutes earlier. To no surprise the order was wrong and cold, but I didn't care enough at this point to correct it and just threw the food away. Great job applebees! I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Chanti was our server.  She's Great!  Funny and very personable.  But the kitchen messed up our order twice. Grrrrrr.  They eventually got it right.  Guess that's OK.  That's why they get a 3 today....  most of that is from Chanti."}
{"text":"Appetizer was spinach and artichoke dip which was good. Steak was cooked well and right (medium-rare). Vegetables and mashed potatoes were average. Service was great though. Server consistently checked on us to make sure everything was good."}
{"text":"This was not the type of service or food I am accustomed to receiving when dining at Applebee's. We walked in and were not greeted because there was no one at the host stand. One of the managers (Keoni) eventually came to greet us. The evening continued to go down hill from there"}
{"text":"25 mins later they bring out a \"steak\" that was literally a light gray thing that looked ran over haha I could've made better food at home for sure"}
{"text":"I'm from the U.S. And my boyfriend is Canadian. Applebee's are a dime a dozen in the states, but my bf said this was the only Applebee's in Calgary and he wanted to see if it was like the others in the states, so we went. We decided to try their \"three appetizers for $18.99\" since, when I was in college, half priced appetizers after 10 pm were always an amazing deal, and the appetizers were usually good. It said in small writing at the bottom that the appetizers are smaller portions so that \"you can try more flavors\" whatever that means or like doing what they do is justified. We ordered the boneless chicken wings, the potstickers and the poutine. Holy cow. For $18.99 we could have both eaten complete meals, where we actually felt full, pretty much ANYWHERE else...there were 5 boneless nuggets, 4 small potstickers and maybe a palm-full of fries. Hell, I could have gone to Walmart and bought a box of potstickers and felt more full for half the price. My boyfriend and I felt uncomfortable \"sharing\" the three appetizers because there was hardly any food to be had. I understand that appetizers mean a smaller portion than a meal...But come on! We left feeling seriously ripped off and still very hungry, but not willing to hork out more cash for a place that's not worth it. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just got home from Applebee's. We took advantage of the Thursday wing special and reverse happy hour. Food was 3.5 stars... Although a little well done, they were very flavorful. The spicy Asian chile is delicious!  Our awesome server, Demetri, was the main reason for the 5 stars. He was super friendly, attentive, pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable and accommodating. Best service I have ever had at any Applebee's."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The food is always consistently good, and the wait staff is always very attentive and pleasant. The only disappointing thing is that they don't have a REAL bar. They only make drinks that are on their menu and they don't know how to make other things, or they only sell beer. They lose a star as far as I'm concerned not having a real bartender that knows how to make drinks on staff."}
{"text":"This place is in business because the seniors enjoy it. Besides that, this place is horrible. Food is frozen and made... staff is a hit or miss and I was disappointed both times. Definitely not worth going to."}
{"text":"At Applebee's, beware of that little computer tablet sitting on your table.  This innocent looking machine might be nice for ordering and paying your bill with a credit or debit cards, but looks can be deceiving.  While waiting for your order, it sits on your table begging for you to play a game.  Thinking that it will only charge a credit card, curiosity got the best of me and I started playing with it.  I played one game.  Well, surprise, surprise!  Applebee's charged me $1.99 for this stupid game I only played once.  I am extremely disappointed in Applebee's allowing this scam in their business.  There is no mention of the cost of playing any of these games prior to playing.  When I complained to a waiter about the extra game charge on my bill, she laughed and said she was not aware of it.  Why would Applebee's risk their hard earned dining reputation on a cheap scam.  By the way, the food was OK."}
{"text":"I've been here twice during my busy lunch break, and I've been very happy with the service.  The price is also great.  I really love the 3 veggy sides; I usually do the macaroni and cheese, house salad and french fries.  You can't beat that for $5.99!  I'm also very impressed with how fast and attentive the servers are during this busy time.  I found the host to be friendly and quick to seat us as well.  I would come back any time for lunch!"}
{"text":"\"Who wants to go to Applebee's by themselves?\" Haha, I wish I had suffered alone and not had my poor Dad insist on paying for 9 people at the table. This is, in all my years of visiting Applebee's across the Valley, the worst location when it comes to food. It's a small location, but the staff is great at handling large and small parties like pros. I have a problem with the portions and the cooks from Hell there. Nothing ever comes out 100% right or 50% appetizing. The burgers my girlfriend and I ordered were only half edible. Meat tasted like 2 day old Jack-in-the-Box. Yes... Just poor quality. The chicken usually comes out as soft as a shoe and the ratio in the pasta bowls of noodle to meat is just laughable. Drinks are good."}
{"text":"-Server gave me a dirty napkin  -Server rushed us to order  -Server gave me a dirty dish  -Server rolled his eyes in front of me and my girl friend when we asked for separate lunch checks (well before he printed the bill).  The food was decent. I've had better at other locations.Service was NOT up to par."}
{"text":"Be very careful paying through those tabletop machines. I went for lunch here on 6/13/18. The service was great nothing wrong there. I paid through the machine,that they have on the table with my card. The next day I didnt use my card because I was sick. I checked my account only to find that my account had been hack for 209 for Rogaine that I dont even use. They had my pin which was only used through the machine on the table. Be careful paying with your card. If you can pay with cash."}
{"text":"There's a reason it's nicknamed \"Crapplebee's\".  S...L...O...W... service for lunch.  Got there at 11:15 & didn't get food until 12:15.  Food was mediocre, but not bad.  One of our colleagues said his burger was crap.  The meat looked like hash browns almost.  Felt like we're eating in a retirement home - old people everywhere and no one was in a hurry.  Restaurant was clean enough, but the wait was ridiculous and unnecessary.  Not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"my husband & i, went here for lunch. it took then forever to get to us. Our Waiter took our drink order & didn't even bother to offer an appetizer. he came back with our drink, did not give us a straw & quickly turn around and came back 15 mts later.  the menu was alot different than the last time we was at Applebees.] everything look really good.  So we finally got to order (we were starving by this time) I order half rack baby back ribs plate,(witch i had before) they had always been yummy,but not this time. let me tell you it was just a plate with dry ribs, hard ( some rotten like)french fries and no slaw i had to ask for it (it came w/plate),15 minutes pass before a got my slaw. my hubby got a combination Cajun steak with shrimp, rice and beans; the rice and beans were hard and dry, so he end up eating the steak  and 3 shrimp only. oh if i had to mention the appetizer ,,I mean terrible, a spicy queso dip with chips were grease and not very well done.  we was disappointed of the food and service. bad service & terrible food, don't recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here for happy hour. He got a tall shock top beer, myself, a red apple sangria. Good drinks for the price. The bartender was nice. And the manager was ok.. She greeted us because the host person was doing chores. We sat at the bar to order.  After we ordered we looked over and seen all the servers and manager gossiping for about 30 minutes. I understand it was late and there were only 2 tables plus us in the place but there's got to be something else to do than sit around on the clock and gossip and play on their cell phones. Over all an ok experience... For drinks."}
{"text":"I really want to like this Applebee's but I just don't. I keep trying and am disappointed every time. We recently went there for dinner and the service was AWFUL. They were sort of busy but not THAT busy. We placed an order for an appetizer which came out after our meal was served. This is the THIRD time this has happened there. I don't understand why this is so difficult to get right!? Our waitress gave a pathetic , \"Eh, sorry\" and walked away. You could at least ACT like you cared a smidgen. No drink refills either, which irked me.  Lunch is somewhat better. At least the service is, anyway. I do love their all you can eat salad and soup at lunch.   I am also not sure why, but the ice tea at this Applebee's and at the IHOP across the street taste funny. Maybe the water? Apparently other people have commented on it as well, because the wait staff have agreed some people notice that taste.   It is a slightly longer drive to go to the Applebees on Gilbert, but I feel like the service is definitely better there, and that is where we will be going from now on."}
{"text":"Food was so good I didn't realize I had eaten my entire burger until I looked down and saw and empty plate. I stopped in for dinner with my boss and coworkers. We had no problem getting a table for 5 around 630pm on a Thursday night but that doesn't mean the place was not busy and hoping. The waitress we had was also our bartender so that meant we were able to get our drinks a little faster than other tables, which was great. We had the salsa and chips, word of caution the salsa was on the spicy side. We also had the artichoke dip which was awesome. I opted for the triple bacon burger and onion rings and it was fabulous. The atmosphere was good and lively and there was no pressure to hurry up and leave which was good because we were there for several hours. All in all I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Decent food. Service was greatly lacking. Came around 1230 on a Tuesday - the place was dead but it still took a long time to get food (salad) and a water refill. The food was VERY skimpy. Also asked about a military discount for a couple people in the party, but was given the run around that the \"electronic\" system would only let 1 person get the discount regardless of the fact we had 6 people in the party with 3 discounts. When the server was asked how to make the discount happen for all the military members you would have thought I asked what the meaning of life is. Horrible. I would only come back if forced, especially with how the military are treated."}
{"text":"I showed up for happy hour, but it was nothing of the sort.  I ordered a beer and watched as the bartender filled a pitcher with foam which sat and reduced to about 2 inches of beer after a few minutes at which time the process was repeated.  I was informed that the taps were improperly calibrated which caused them to foam excessively.  Then she said that she was not allowed to pour out the foam because it wastes beer.  In the end, after about 10 minutes, I received a flat beer.  Are you f'kin kidding me??  You cheap m'fers!!  I will never return because of your idiocy."}
{"text":"Gross is all I could say! My husband ordered the 4cheese bacon Mac n Cheese ...Gross. I ordered spinach and artichoke dip because they have no vegetarian options  ....Gross. Do not go there. Our server was very nice though. They ran out of silver wear while we were there and by the time we got some, our food was cold!! Gross !!! My stomach hurts now!"}
{"text":"It would only get two stars but my friend liked her food and my steak in spite of only being able to be seasoned with salt (my mouth can't handle pepper) still had flavor. The steak was very well done not the medium well that I ordered which I do so because most places including this one have a tendency to barely hit medium when I ask for medium well. It would get more stars if not for the butchered meat and the baked potato was not washed and did not taste good. How do you mess up a baked potato? I do not know but this location and the one at Charleston and Decatur have done this. I do not like the chicken fingers and their hamburger is barely edible. So I am willing to put up this place if a friend wants to eat there but I will not be suggesting it. The service is good. Also writing into Applebee's seems to do no good because I did that the last time I had a not get experience with the food at this location."}
{"text":"I know this place is gets bad reviews a lot but when I come here a lot, I don't get any bad service or food. Everything is just fine. I took my girlfriend here and did the 2For25 and I had a good raspberry lemonade and she had a margarita(she's 22 and I'm almost 21, no drinks quite yet for me)"}
{"text":"If you've had issues at this Applebees before, it is worth giving another try! *Under new management.  My boyfriend and I go to this Applebees every Friday. Just recently this establishment underwent new management and what a difference it has made!  During the transition, our meal was cooked incorrectly up but the manager Brian not only covered our next meal, but made sure we were happy and satisfied with our meal and service. He is always such a joy!  Brian goes above and beyond for his customers and it's reflecting in his staff.   Give it a go. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I cam here for lunch and my experience was mediocre to say the best the server got my strawberry perfect wrong ans gave me mango the we got the build your own sampler with the stomachs shrimp which looks nothing like the picture and is mayo based while the description does make you think its a barbecue base so beware the potstickers were luscious but they are everywhere hard thing to mess up. We also got the wonton tacos they were good as well ny other food was very poorly made I wouldn't suggest going here and I usually love applebees"}
{"text":"Well where to start we have had several bad experiences with this applebees specifically. The staff is inattentive and makes a habit of getting things on the order wrong. The most recent experience we sat at the bar for about five minutes maybe longer with staff looking at us but never acknowledging. No one ever came up to us or greeted us. Needless to say we walked out and will not be back"}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I come here it's either a hit or a miss, and it doesn't matter if the place is busy or not. We love the food and all, but the service sucks. Every time, every single time we come here they always make excuses... How many times can they tell you their servers are new and blame that for their mistakes?   Tonight we came in for a nice sit down dinner, and they screwed our, as well as the two tables closest to us, meal up. The one couple left as soon as they got their change (approx 40 minutes after they paid), the couple behind us has gotten their order messed up at least twice. Apparently we have started something here, two more booths have complained... One just left, and the other (a family and kids) said the server kept making mistakes.   I was going to give the place one star, but they comped our meal and that of the couple next to us whose food they kept messing up. The food is great, but the service is going down the toilet with each passing day.  Applebee 's get your act together!"}
{"text":"The waitress was excellent but the food can be better. Salty.... on every dishs and they gave me tap water no filter at all."}
{"text":"I placed a Carside-to-Go order online and almost immediately after arriving a hostess greeted me at my vehicle. She was so helpful and friendly. I will definitely be ordering from this location again!"}
{"text":"Currently been sitting in this Applebee's for 1 hour waiting for service... This Applebee's is packed, so it's understandable that service would be slow but an entire hour seated waiting on food/drinks is ridiculous. Why would you seat more people when you can't even handle the current tables??? Will not be returning... Waitress is also a extremely rude."}
{"text":"This place is awful!! Margaritas taste terrible, our chips came out WET!!!  Asked for water and took three other trips for the waitress to remember it.  I recommend skipping this and going to peter piper pizza next door, at least you get games with your food there."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The staff and service at this location are awful, however. I would even go as far as to say that this place has the worst service I've ever experienced at a chain restaurant (which is really saying something)."}
{"text":"Ate there for dinner today and for some reason the food was not appealing or fresh? After getting home this evening I have had an upset stomach!! This was the only thing I ate all day. Now I'm up late catering to my nausea because of what I ate when I have to be up for work at 4am. Very disappointed.?"}
{"text":"Poor service. Brought out the wrong order (salad) and was of little help. And veryyyyy slow. I won't be back. Ended up not eating anything because of their incompetency"}
{"text":"Great service, 5 dollar mama and food. I love happy hour. Tiffany thank you. She works at the bar."}
{"text":"I never go to Applebee's restaurant's as they've never been up on my radar. When going in the staff is nice, but after 15 minutes we finally had someone come and ask for drink orders, and a few minutes later they appeared. He didn't return until 24 minutes later to take our order. The appetizers had clearly been sitting out as the dips had dried up on the top. The food literally took 47 minutes to come out after they finally came to order it. When it did come, the orders had some of our requests (sauce on the side, no pickles on the burger) wrong. And ultimately, after 3 hours there, I said my friends should say something, to which they replied that it had been far worse in the past. But for now, don't go. Come downtown to one of the well known local spots, much better food, service and overall experience."}
{"text":"We popped by here one weekday evening for a quick dinner. Our friends had told us that Applebee's had great portion sizes & quality for cheap prices but neither of us were impressed with our meals. We also ordered the lava cake for dessert and it was just not good at all. So bland.   The place was basically empty. That being said, the service was excellent! Our waitress was very friendly and attended to our needs immediately."}
{"text":"I loving coming to eat here, they have the best deals. Although the service could definitely use some improvement. The waiters/ waitresses seem like they don't wanna be there and they are no very friendly. The food is great!! Went to the Apple bees in savoy and they are awesome! Super friendly and they make sure you leave happy."}
{"text":"If you're going to eat here, avoid the Double Crunch Shrimp off their 2 for $24 deal. The double crunch really is DOUBLE CRUNCH. They definitely over did the frying on the shrimp along with the fries. Even my boyfriend, who is a avid foodie and is pretty much easily content with any meal, found distaste in his shrimp.  I ordered the Bourbon Street Steak as I've ordered it many times before at different Applebees restaurants and this time around.. It tasted a little too bland for my liking. I was quite disappointed since I really do enjoy this dish.  Our waitress was okay, but was very awkward when we told her it was our friend's birthday and asked if they did anything special. She said that can give a free dessert in which I agreed to. The dessert came towards the end of the meal, of course, but she was so awkward in delivering it. It was just her and she kind of tried to \"sneak it\" on the table. There was no happy birthday song from her or the staff so me and my friends kind of had to take over from there. I'm sure its different for a kid's birthday though - I mean, my friend turned 23 so I guess they don't find the need to sing happy birthday at that age,  All in all, this place falls a little below \"alright\" for me. I've had better experiences at other Applebees. I probably won't be back here anytime soon or in the near future."}
{"text":"If you sit in the bar area, you shouldn't have a problem.  One night we got stuck at a table outside the bar because every seat was filled and had the worst experience ever. Waited 15 minutes for water, after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged..... Yeah, ..so just -1 star for that experience. But if you go sit at the bar with AJ or Kaleigh and you will be in good hands."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums up my experience pretty perfectly. I ordered the tomato basil soup with a side of fries, while my dad got the brunch burger and my mom chose the Thai shrimp salad. I'm no picky eater by any means, and of course I don't expect Applebee's to be the most gourmet meal I've ever had, but my \"bowl\" of soup looked like the perfect portion for a 4 yr. old. (or maybe i just have a never-ending stomach idk you decide). Either way, the food was overpriced and pretty meh in all areas. I would've been so okay with a can of campbell's and some mickey d's fries.  Also, the place was pretty empty but it took close to 12 years for the food to come out. dang soup!  BUT THAT BEING SAID, the waitstaff were all very lovely and kind people, and that's all that honestly matters.  2 stars food 500 stars for service :-)"}
{"text":"This was a bad experience.  Did car side to go. They told me that the food would be ready by 4:30 (12 minutes). I pull up and no one comes outside. I go inside by the check stand and it's 4:45. No one there. I go back out to my car and wait another 5 minutes. Someone comes out brings food, etc. she was nice.   The chicken cavatappi might have been one of the worst things I've ever eaten. I've had it before, and it's decent for what the price is. But wow. They just have forgot an ingredient or something. I won't be going back, unfortunately. There are too many places in the southwest with better service and food quality for similar pricing."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our server. She was really amazing and very helpful.  The food took forever to come out (not busy), and once it did, we discovered that the main entree had a piece of plastic accidentally inside.  We complained to Mgmnt and they gave us coupons for next time.  Overall, an \"okay\" experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided Applebee's would be the place for lunch.  Been a lot of places to eat in my life, but the manager \"Benjamin\" at the restaurant impressed me.  Most places when you say you would like to move, because the area where you are sitting is to cold.  Back to your vehicle to get a sweater or  you move to another section.  No, he told us to stay where we were and in about 3mins we would feel a difference.  Not only did he do that, but he came back later and sat with us for a few moments to see if we were okay.  Job well done Sir.  Liked that waiter let us know that they were a little busy, it would be just a little bit for the food, but it didn't really take that long.  When we did received our food,  it was hot and delicious.  I would definitely go back to this particular Applebee's!"}
{"text":"This place is gross service sucks.i think I just heard bartender say she needs to poop:/."}
{"text":"The staff here is great. Was seated immediately, our waitress was attentive and great with recommendations. My food tasted great, very warm, and a comfortable environment. These are 5 star qualities for me: attentive, polite, and flavor. I'd recommend this location immediately when in the area again."}
{"text":"3/23/2013 dinner  Had a family dinner at the local Applebees.  Service here is always spot on.  Price is always good for the food we get.  I'm a huge fan of this Applebees when it comes to chains.  Not all Applebees are the same.  This one does it right.  The kids love the mozzarella sticks so we ordered those while we were looking over the menu.  They came out within minutes.  Before we ordered dinner.  I'm fine with that.  Kept the kiddos happy.  I ordered French onion.  Was pretty good.  Not the best I've had.  But pretty good.  Had the Riblets platter for dinner.  Everything again was served hot.   Cooked perfect.  At the right price.  What more could I ask for?  Only complaint is they took off the maple butter brownie from their dessert menu.  BRING IT BACK OR I BOYCOTT YOU FOR GOOD.  Overall its what I expected and we will return (when we can get our favorite dessert again)."}
{"text":"So we had a gift card to use up (being many Applebees are closing) and we returned last Sunday.  We did go early this time.  Arrived at 4pm or so.  Hardly anyone in the place and still service lacked.  Our waitress was \"nice\" enough but not good on refilling drinks and we ordered Motts sticks that came out cold."}
{"text":"My Applebee's is located in Surprise, AZ, and I frequent it often. It has a great decor and atmosphere and the staff treat everyone special. You can dine in or place an order, anything on the regular menu, for carryout pickup later. I use the google Applebee's application which makes ordering so much easier. You can place an order and choose what date and time you wish to pick it up.  Another plus with me is their hours. They're open late and serve food till 0200hrs on the weekends. It's not easy finding somewhere to order and purchase great culinary dishes late at night. Speaking of which they have an outstanding menu of various dishes, appetisers, deserts and bar list. There is a delight on that menu for anyone's choosing. Most all their dishes are seasoned and prepared with Applebee's proprietary touch making them most delectable. I love their ribs but my favorite is their huge bone in grilled pork chop served with their delicious garlic mashed potatoes and  bacon garlic green beans.  A great place to dine out with the whole family. During the later part of the evening an excellent choice to take a date or that special someone for a nice dinner after a movie. Great food and bar, friendly staff providing excellent service, competitive prices, it's got all the squares checked for the best choice for any occasion.  Your Happy Eater, bon-appetite!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, the wait could have been shorter but that's OK the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I went into this location for Veterans Day and was not disappointed. The service was great and the waitstaff was professional. The Veterans Day menu was good, but as a vegetarian obviously I had to special order the chicken penne so that it wouldn't Include chicken, no problem no questions asked came out great.  Nice ambience, great food and great prices, nice for a quick bite to eat for lunch. Will be going back for lunch one day for sure."}
{"text":"We like Applebees so no review there. But we wondered why Happy Hour only included beer and not wine. Also, the credit card machine now comes to the table. We thought it was to save time. We got our receipts with the totals hand written that somebody had to write accurately. Why?  The totals could have been circled or highlighted. We swiped our credit cards through the machine and signed. Then our busy waitress hurriedly brought us the receipts to sign again. Why are we signing the receipt again if we ran our own cards?  Seemed awkward, and our busy waitress seemed frustrated, but kind. Totally unnecessary. Perhaps this pay system needs to be rethought."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we were frequent visitors, but I've always pretty good service here.  Between our trips to the bar, for sit down food, and take out food - it could make sence that they knew who we were.  I worked right in that area and we enjoyed that we could just walk over there for lunch.  It also served as a great after work spot that everyone could agree on.    I know, I know, chains are evil... but there is a lot to be said for a spot that you can take a vegetarian, a burger and beer girl, a Martini girl, a \"get the party started pre-strip club\" kind of guy, a few sports nuts who'll go anywhere as long as the game is on, and some folks who just want food - and they can all find something they like.    Finally - when we said \"hey, we're here for lunch so we have to go kinda fast\" they would always hustle to get us out on time.  So is it my spot of choice, heck no.  But it's not a bad default option."}
{"text":"I just spent $14 for a barely mediocre soup and salad.  As the food was nothing special, I had lots of time to think.  Here's what I came up with:  1) If I was going to ASU this would be the place to hang out.  Why? Because you don't seem to find freshmen here.  It's close to the university, but not RIGHT on campus.  What was all around me?  Upper class-men.  And what were they talking about?  School.  In one hour long lunch I know people's grades, which teachers are fair in several subjects, tricks to doing philosophy papers in Mr. What's his name's class, how to get into a particular program without an interview and a bevy of other university delights.  I even heard someone getting a killer deal on a rental house and someone looking for housing.  One stop shopping.  2) I hate that Applebee's is one of the only places I can safely go now that I've become a dreaded nutrition/calorie counter. Their Weight Watcher's menu let's me order in complete confidence.  I actually have options!  I took a friend to Essence the other day (Applebee's polar opposite in all ways, and one of my favorite places to go) and I was really stuck.  There is no nutritional information.  They have no idea which of their items have less calories.  No idea of the sodium content of that chicken salad.  I made a \"I think this will work\" guess, but I'm pretty sure I under estimated when I was attempting to over estimate. I love going to independently owned places.  I miss it.  I really really do.  But today when I was just way more hungry than that frozen meal was going to solve Applebee's was my only safe option in the area.  3) This location's Weight Watcher meals aren't as good as some other locations.  There shouldn't be a difference in a chain - but boy oh boy is there!  4) Other folks around me were happily devouring their food.  A table of girls eating behind me was on their 2nd helpings of unlimited soup and salad for $5.99.  I suppose the rest of their fare is fairly standard Applebee's stuff.  5) While I don't want to repeat this again any time soon, My guess is that I'll be back here at least once every 2 months because I want something beyond what I brought to work.  Just the thought of it makes me a bit queasy.  6) If I'm willing to pay $14 for crappy soup and salad (for only 400 calories) in a crappy place, with crappy surroundings - why can't more independent places step up and offer some healthy options they can be proud of?  Proud enough to post those nutritional numbers on the menu.  Heavens knows I'm not the only one..."}
{"text":"Typically we order the entree & appetizer specials, two entrees with one appetizer for $20. Great value as there's a lot of food for two people to share. The boneless buffalo wings are our favorite, unbeatable for flavor and always cooked to perfection. Highly recommended. The cedar chicken with quinoa is also super delicious, almost a bit too healthy (if there is such a thing) but yummy, nonetheless. The service does fall a bit short as the population of diners far exceeds the staff they have. This is definitely a regular thing, given we have dined there four times in the last two months and the service was the same every time we ate there."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, excellent manager name Frank running this place. Server was very friendly, my food was not what I expected, however it was really good. Frank made sure we were completely satisfied before finishing our meal."}
{"text":"In high school I would head to Applebees a few times a month. Afterwards, I all but swore it off. Another national chain that was using huge portions to justify bloated prices. But my last trip was promising. The food was good, the prices were fair, and the portions were about right.  Before I'd say go somewhere else for dinner and stop by Applebees for a blondee for desert. Now, I can see wanting to make a trip there for dinner again!"}
{"text":"Rough experience.  Had to keep asking for water refills.  We asked for ketchup and she said they were out and she would have to wait until some other table finished using theirs. Fries were heat lamp warm at best.  Usually have good service and experience here but not this time."}
{"text":"Good food, great service!!  What more can I say?  The place was clean, had a good atmosphere, all of the staff were friendly...  Yes I would dine here again. Good Bloody Mary too!!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the block from my apartment, so don't judge me. Alot of good specials on food and drinks, so there's no complaint there. But here's the kicker: I came here to get a drink with my gf and watch a little of the nba all star game... A lady walked in and sat down next to us at the bar. She seemed to be irritated before she even sat down, so i knew fireworks might happen between her and the servers. she orders her drink, takes one look up at the screen and says \"are you guys serious? figure skating is on (at the winter olympics) and you have this crap on (nba all star game)?\" at this point im in full listen mode. the bartender explains to her that this is a popular game and he cant change it. she drinks her entire drink in one gulp, slams down some money, and yells out \"im never coming here again!\".right when she walks out the bartender looks me dead in the eye and says \"I hope she keeps her promise. now i can finally watch the damn game in peace!\".   Amen brother"}
{"text":"We came in with 12 people. We were seated quickly, and no one had any complaints about the food. Our waitress was fantastic. I had the Shrimp and Parmesan Sirloin."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for two three years... Always clean and never too hot or cold....I usually sit at the bar so don't know the servers well but bar staff are all cool.... Some of the old timers are gone but still a few I recognize.... I used to love the sirloin but this last time a lil too chewy for my style....  They usually have five or six diff draft beer options with one or two taps rotating... They have summer shandy as the only seasonal right now....... All time fave dessert is the Blondie and always will be"}
{"text":"I understand that we got there at about 40 minutes to closing, but that's not an excuse for the bad service. Upon arrival, it took 5 minutes to be greeted for a table( on top of that fact,  most of the tables in the dining room were dirty, so we had to wait extra for one to be cleared off). When we were finally seated 8 minutes after walking into the restaurant, we still had to wait another few minutes for a server to come over to get our drink orders (there was only one other table in the section). The woman who greeted us wasn't even our server! A minute after she left, another lady (our actual server) came to get our drink orders, and when she realized someone else had gotten there, we were rushed to place our food orders. That was the last time we saw her until closing. At 12, the server dropped off the check. In the time that we'd been dining, not once had we been asked how the meal was going, if we needed drink refills, or even if we wanted dessert or boxes. As soon as midnight came around, every employee seemed to forget there were guests and preceded to work on side-work. At one point, there was not one employee on the floor for 5-8 minutes; they were in the kitchen laughing and chatting away. She never came over to collect the payment for the check. I had to physically get up and look for my server in order to pay because it had been 15 minutes at that point. We weren't the only ones looking for service either. When our server finally returned to the floor, she remarked \"oh you're ready\". While processing our check, the couple at the bar informed her that one of the tables might have done a walk out; there was no money on the table nor was there a signed slip for card transactions. Her response: \"That wouldn't be the first time tonight\". At this point, I'm shocked. Never will we dine there again if that is the standards they set."}
{"text":"This location does not deserve 1 star, absolutely horrible. My boyfriend and I walked out, his limeade was bad, sprite tasted like sour milk, our appetizers came out on a dirty plate, and the wings were cold. Waitress named Britney didn't even provide silver ware. Usually I would go hunt a manger down but we were so disgusted that we walked out. Walked right past our waitress and she didn't even bother to ask what was wrong. Never ever will we return. Went to Olive Garden and got 5 star service."}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas for a year we have been going to expensive restaurant to eat. Or going to restaurants that they do not have in maryland. We went to an Applebee's at 6:58pm Karen C was our server. she is an excellent server. Everything was on time. She was busy but she was still prompt on service.  Thank you Karen for making it a delightful evening for my husband and I."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I normally enjoy this chain restaurant but this location was simply dreadful. On this occasion I ordered the chicken finger basket. When the strips came out they were noticeably BURNED, the waitress dropped them so quickly that I didn't get the opportunity to point this out. I figured I would say something next time she came by to check on us or refill our drinks but we didn't see her until she gave us our check. She asked if she could box my strips for me and I said, no, they were burned. She looked down and said, \"oh they are, well our chicken strips aren't good here anyway.\" What kind of service is that!?! It was not clean, the bathrooms smelled and the table and booth were grimy. There was nothing positive I could say about this location."}
{"text":"Applebee's was always a go to place for a girl night out for happy hour. Drinks were always good & appetizers were always filling but the last few months has been a very bad experience for my little family & I. We came here for my boyfriends birthday & he ordered a steak (medium rare) & they brought out a rare steak that looked like it was only put on the grill for a few seconds on each side. The steak was RAW. We complained the the manager himself took the steak back in the kitchen & a few mins later came back & gave him the same steak but they had flipped it over. A few months later we decided to give them another chance, burger was super greasy, appetizers were always GREAT. My youngest daughter ordered pizza & the side was yogurt. As she was eating her yogurt she stated there was onions in her yogurt & we didn't believe it at first until we checked. I don't think we will ever come back here."}
{"text":"Walked in tonight because we wanted a quick bite from a well known neighborhood place. The place was pretty much empty except for a few tables but the girl at the door, Kayla, told us there was a 20 top and so she'd have to see if there was an available table.....uh...ok? She came back and sat us not only by the 20 top, but next to a screaming child. We asked to be seated elsewhere and she said \"ok, but you're gonna have to wait now\" and directed us to go back to the front to wait. The bar was completely empty, the south side of the restaurant had maybe 2 tables and she wants us to sit there in the foyer and wait? Nah.... we just went to another of the 30 restaurants in the area. I could understand if they were busy but come on, this was ludicrous."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason they got a star is for Lexi, the hostess. We came in on a Monday night, the host put our name in, Lexi chatted us up while we waited (he said 5 min), another family of 5 walks in, the loud ass lady claims, \"I got kids, we need to be seated right away\"!. Well, lady, I hate corporate places but when your family wants to eat somewhere, you gotta go so F you, wait your damn turn! The manager, Michelle, comes over, takes the wait list from Lexi and proceeds to find these people a table and then seats them before us!! I'm beside myself! I calmly explain to my family why we don't eat at corporate and we left. Felt bad for the poor hostess,  apologizing profusely because her manager sucks at her job. I hope she gets a real job at a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and service are always good but the last two times we went the food took a while to come out. Other then that the place is clean and never crowed from my experience"}
{"text":"This place is a train wreck. The only good thing to come out of this Applebee's was Regina running around and running the whole restaurant.  It is currently 6 on a Sunday night and she is the only server running the floor while there are 6 servers sitting around at random tables scattered over the restaurant watching Regina run around.  The only help she had was the host, Alex, who was seating tables, cleaning tables and checking on food and tables for her. He is doing more than the 6 other servers in the restaurant.  This looks like a clear lack of management going on in this entire restaurant.  We sent back a sirloin that was well done and was supposed to be medium rare. No manager in sight.  Regina is too good for this restaurant!  The bartender spent most of his time vaping behind the bar. Cool vape bro."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour around 10PM. As soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was pretty dull and empty. There was maybe another 10 people in the entire restaurant. We waited to be seated for about a good 7 minutes and absolutely no one greeted us. Then after we sat ourselves, we sat at our table talking for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone approached us at our table (we have no been in the restaurant about 20ish minutes with no one attempting to welcome or assist us) - reminding you that it was not busy in the slightest. Eventually, it got to the point where we pushed the \"Call Server\" button on the little table kiosk and she still didn't come for another 5 minutes. I look over toward the rear of the restaurant and all the waitresses, other than the bartender, were sitting down in a booth talking and not responding to their tables. Finally, we are helped, but the service continues to be just as poor. The waitress brought us our drinks and our food slowly and after that she visited our table once, and it still was not busy so we should've been a piece of cake for her to handle. My boyfriend and I both work in jobs that require exceptional customer service and know how terrible it is to get a bad review on your store location and typically we wouldn't post one, but I never had worse service than I have with this experience. Every other Applebee's I've been to has always done really amazing! So I'm sad to say that this location wasn't up to par standards. Definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"One of the most disorganized Apple Bee's experiences. The service was rushed at all times. This rush caused the main course to arrive before the appetizers. Big screw up and all the waitress had to say was \"at least you have more food at once\". Ridiculous is all I can say. The bourbon shrimp and chicken had a strong burnt taste which is unacceptable on all counts. The boneless buffalo wings were the only thing worth having.  These folks seriously need to get their sh!t together."}
{"text":"Service friendly. Food just meh. Wouldnt walk across the street for it. My entree was not prepared properly. The other entree ordered just didnt taste good. Manager offered free dessert to make amends."}
{"text":"Ok I was impressed when I saw that each table had a sort if tablet/point of sale/virtual waiter! You could order, call a real waiter, look at the menu and even pay! It was very interactive...   We ordered a margarita, and a cherry limeade! Both tasted fake! The appetizer was good, but again, there isn't too much to screw up on a dip and tortilla chips.   The main course was were the problem really was... I had the Napa chicken, but it felt more like south east LA chicken. No more comments!    I couldn't even finish it. Oh , also, it's te to shampoo the carpet. I could smell it.   But I guess that's what I get for 2for $25!"}
{"text":"I don't like chains, but after going to Applebees in Strongsville, I see why people do...  Not only did we have quick service, but because it was after 9, our apps were half-off!    I ordered one of the weight watchers meals, which, to be honest, really surprised me because it tasted like a 1500 calorie meal, not 550.    The pretzel sticks were more like pretzel donuts, but they were good (even if surprisingly unhealthy!!)  But the thing that really clinched the night - the bill.  Wow, that's it?  Maybe I\"ll have to be open minded about Applebees in the future..."}
{"text":"On my first foray here I opened with a Signature Combo Lunch of a crock of excellent French Onion Soup--clearly baked and finished off with a crown of Swiss Cheese--and an Oriental Chicken Salad with excellent Dumpling Sauce with a kick and very good lemony Oriental Dressing.    Meanwhile, on a low carb diet, Diane enjoyed a bunless Bacon Cheeseburger.  Service was excellent. Extra requested Dumpling Sauce and Oriental Sauce for the Chicken Salad were graciously supplied.  Our server turned out to be the bartender doing double duty; the staff seemed to be shorthanded.  On a down note I saw one flea hovering over our table after we had completed eating.  This was a nice and tasty casual lunch."}
{"text":"Meh... they were under staffed due to some call offs. It's hard to give them a bad review when employees don't show but the service was slow and the food was average. They were packed so the seating was cramped. My review is just plain meh."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about waiting almost 7 minutes for a server but I think the limit for waiting time is at least less than a min. A server should greet their guest within the first 30 seconds unless their busy than no longer than 60 seconds would be ideal. There are 3 people on the floor and no one came to our table for almost 7 mins. I'm not one to complain but when you have a restaurant that doesn't look busy, mind you there wasn't very much people here when we came in to eat dinner. Someone should come to the table and at least talk to their guest and apologize about the wait and the server will be right over. The food came out fairly quickly and the service wasn't that great. I just think the guest shouldn't be waiting that long when the restaurant isn't even busy."}
{"text":"They just have terrible service. The managers do not know how to run the store, two years ago the store was all right. The restaurant had OK food for an OK price, but now they don't. The food cost over $10, which I understand the restaurant has no Way to change that. But the way the manager handles the restaurant, is very poor. The kitchen is always filthy and loud, and the service overall just isn't good. The only benefit, is if you complain about the food, most of the time they will either pay for it or get you a new dish. But I'm pretty sure they are told to do that by their bosses. Other Applebee's are much better than this location on McKnight road. Just go somewhere else is what I would recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were hungry and wanted a sit down place to relax, eat and get out of the heat for a bit. He suggested Applebee's so off we were to get some grub. I have not been to an Applebee's in a very very long time.  We ordered the two for twenty deal, I got the Fiesta chicken and he ordered the cajun shrimp and chicken dish which includes one appetizer to share so we went with the mild buffalo wings (boneless) with ranch.  The meal was good and the service was pleasant as we had a sweet waitress who called us kids, I thought it was cute.   I probably won't step foot into Applebee's for another year or so."}
{"text":"While on vacation First I have to wait for the host to come to the front , she was polite but when she was telling us we had a 15 minute wait she was trying to convince us to leave instead of maybe offering a booth at the bar. Poor service"}
{"text":"Like frozen food heated up?   Like skimpy portions?   Like high prices for garbage?   Then you will love Applebees!!!   Pure disappointment was in store for me on my first and last visit.   Not only was my dish a bland, cold, overly greasy fried mess, but my entire party had issues with all as well.   Salads are OK, the only thing that may be their saving grace.   Everything else is frozen precooked and heated food that taste as if had been sitting around awhile.   The service was OK, however that is hit and miss as it really depends on the server you may end up with. It can go right or way wrong! That is the 50/50 chance you take dining out at the more commercial restaurants.   There are just too many great places to eat in Las Vegas that are out of this world at a fraction of the cost! I would never again waste my money on below mediocre quality!   The meals not creative, no flair or real flavor! Whoever is responsible for the menu planning needs to be dropped! Applebees come see me and I can give you a few great suggestion's on how to turn your bad menu into something wowing!   Disappointed beyond all comprehension!   Side note:   *** The dish I had ordered was the buttermilk breaded fried shrimp, it is no longer on their menu and has now been replaced with a double crunch shrimp dinner. Wow what a shocker!!!  Yes maybe the double crunch shrimp will fare better as the original menu item of the buttermilk fried shrimp was soggy and flavorless.  I am sure many complaints were issued such as mine about such a horrid dish!"}
{"text":"For lunch I picked two classics for $6.99 the spinach salad and 3 cheese chicken penne pasta was yummy!  Great service, not busy."}
{"text":"So lunch was a bust. Ordered the macaroni and cheese and 1/2 a sandwich on the top of the lunch menu.  Received cold macaroni and cheese and a 1/4 of a sandwich with a tablespoon of turkey. Ryan took it back to the kitchen and the ? Assistant Manager brought out an even worst looking less bacon, pitiful sandwich.  Then the Manager came and agreed with me that neither one of the sandwiches should have left the kitchen. Why???."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with the Gson. Got seated exactly where I wanted to sit, like the boy read my mind lol. It was a booth in the bar section. The bright busy decor had me mesmerized. I had a number of Flat screen tv's to chose from, I picked a spot perfect to watch the Men's FIBA. My Gson was mad for some \"meat\" he said thats all he wanted. He was able to chose his entree, side & drink from a multiple choice option list. It was awesome. I am a vegetarian and I have to say it's slim pickings but I luv APPLEBEES. I got the Spinach/Artichoke Dip & Cheese Quesadilla, too much dairy for me but it was GREAT!!! Gracie was our server very pleasant & accommodating. And she even called me \"Miss\"  I would have given 5 stars, no vegetarian or vegan options."}
{"text":"Gave 1 star because I had to. I ordered dinner over the phone and went to get it and when I arrived they were not taking credit cards.  It was just a salad so I was only told 10 minutes and the credit card machine had been down for awhile.  So why wasn't I told that over the phone? I tried to call today and order because I'm staying at the hotel next door and it's easy and the closest place. However,  I asked if they were taking credit cards today and was put on hold which I think she just left the phone off the hook and then a minute and a half later someone just hung up on me. Applebee's is a crappy restaurant and will always remain crappy no matter the redecoration or new menu.  If you can't get decent staff no one is going to want to go. I thought I would give it a try but I'm done now."}
{"text":"My friend ordered red wine, the waitress Sierra brought her drink telling her they were out of wine glasses, the drink had foam at the top. My friend tasted her drink it was beer. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the quality of food! Many years ago Applebee's had some great tasting food varieties. I used to get the oriental chicken salad and it was tasty and fresh. I ordered it yesterday and it was like eating a premixed, packaged bag of salad with some chopped up greasy fried chicken. The spinach artichoke dip tasted like it was taken from the freezer and thawed out in the microwave. The only thing that saved it was our friendly and attentive server \"Debbie\". Thanks to her it was slightly palatable."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The waitress was rude and when we ask her a question about a meal she would get sarcastic and rude. When are food came it was overcooked and when we told the manager he looked agitated. This is the worst service i have EVER had at an Applebee's. RUN!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I always come here for a quick dinner & sometimes we have our friends with us too. Lately the hostess has been changed & are more friendlier than the previous ones (teenagers). The manager is very nice & makes sure that you get the proper & great service from your server. As a group our favorite servers would be Stephanie, Annette, & Alex. Sometimes being in a group can be a little bit more stressful due to different confusions here & there but every one of these ladies (when they are our server) are very attentive & always makes our visit go smoothly & more fun. The food are always wonderful & they always have the half off prize appetizers every time we visit (not an everyday promotion)."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in with out 2 daughters and baby last Tuesday night. Our server was Jeff and he was by far the best server we've ever had. He is excellent not just with customers but with our kids. They were totally happy and entertained and taken care of because of his service. This is the first meal we have had our as a family that was completely and totally pleasant and enjoyable because the kids didn't go insane. We were able to not just get through dinner but sit and enjoy it enough that we actually stayed and ordered desert for us; he took care of the kids so it was a non-issue. Couldn't speak more highly of a server other than to say i wish more were like him. We will be back and asking for Jeff to be our server."}
{"text":"So I'm sure everyone has been to an Applebees in their lifetime. This particular location has terrible customer service! I've been there a few times hoping their customer service improves and only because it is a close location to where I live and for their happy hour. When you walk in you normally have to eye down the hosts or waiters to know that you are there waiting. Rarely is there anyone greeting you. They take a while with their food even when it's not busy, and their food is typically really salty. I wouldn't recommend this location, only if you're desperate for some cheap drinks during happy hour."}
{"text":"I got there on a crazy day...usually the lunchtime crowds are small...it was packed and I waited a while, not their fault...I was still served a drink right away...and I came for the Beer Cheese...I dare you to try it!!"}
{"text":"This is about the worst Applebees there is. And I don't hold high hopes for any Applebee's. The food is usually crappy, so much that my circle of friends all refer to this location as the Crapplebee's. On a good night, its edible.  I do venture in there. Trial and error has taught me you sit at the bar, but only when Chuck is around. (The second star is all for him.) Let him make you a drink before dinner, and then order either ribs, a burger, or a sandwich. Pretend there is nothing else on the menu. And let Chuck bring them as fast as drink them."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure why I'm doing this to myself, blame boredom! Ok so I've only been to an Applebee's like four times in the last 11 years(that's 4 too many times), that's how long I've been living in AZ. However, This specific location has got to be the absolute worst. It smells bad when you walk in, like some old dive bar smell. The lunch I had today gave me a tummy ache almost instantly(some sort of fish&chips mockery)! Barfffffolaaaa! For the record I only ended up at Applebee's because the pizza place near by \"santisi brothers\"(had a groupon I needed to redeem) was closed at 1pm and obviously I only had the one hour to grab food. I felt the need to clear my name - I'd never just choose to dine at AppleBs. Anyway, the point is, my final thoughts:  If you are even just a little cool, smart, good looking, classy, fancy, hip and/or awesome THEN APPLEBEES IS NOT FOR YOU. I'm of the opinion that this establishment is for more of the trailer living, nascar loving, country listening & lower classes if you will.   Hey that's just me, my opinion, take it or leave it no worries. I do like to keep it real tho"}
{"text":"The gf and her kid wanted to go to Chili's but I got in the wrong lane and we ended up at Applebees as traffic was killer.  We checked in and it was packed but my mouth was watering for a Bourbon Street Steak and the 20 min wait didnt bother us to much. Of course I used that time to read the YELP reviews and I should have pulled us out but we were committed.  It turned into a 25minute wait when we were finally seated our server was over whelmed but very pleasant and after taking our drink order it took 15 mins to get a chocolate milk but I did get my water right away.  The GF had a chicken salad and two bites into it she bit down and found a BLACK PIECE OF GLASS IN A CHUNK OF CHICKEN.  She was ok but was so upset she couldn't finish her meal. They took her salad off the bill but really they should have comped the entire meal. It also took the Manager another 15mins to come check on us.  If something like that happened in my store you should check on them immediately! She then tried to say it was probably something that happened at the plant where they buy their Chicken and not there fault. REALLY? YOU SERVED US THE FOOD AND YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE?   I love Applebees but I wont be going back as long as there are so many other local eateries to patronize. Im sorry guys but this was a horrendous experience."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing a place like this because it may help place other reviews in context.  I couldn't find the Applebee's that I went to on Crocker Park, so I chose this location instead. (They're all supposed to be the same, right?)  I guess this is good place to come to if you have a large group and decided to eat something at the last minute and don't want to worry about making reservations."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:30 pm and say at the bar. Behind the bar was the manager Michele and Jon. No greeting from either! After figure out our drink order, app and dinner my husband finally asked if we were supposed to use the little computer to put in an order. Michele came up and room our drink and app order 15 minutes after sitting down. The first time they spoke to us. Later Jon came and asked for our food order, my husband said it and after an awkward minute her said sorry bro I didn't get that. Wasn't even paying attention! Food was good drinks were ok but service was Terrible!!! We counted 15 people including my husband and 1 and 3 people working. You weren't overwhelmed but you were definitely disrespectful! I dont recommend this Applebee's. Could you imagine if they were busy!"}
{"text":"The waiter was super friendly and nice however the restaurant was empty, took almost and hour to get any food, when food came sides were missing and one of the dishes had been reheated causing the cheese to harden horribly. In speaking to the manager, manager was pompous and arrogant towards my mother. Asked to get a comment card and manager got defensive and accusatory"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Applebee's we have ever been to.  The girl who's served the alcoholic drinks, had no idea what the difference between Gin & Vodka was.  Got the drink screwed up and had a snippy attitude.  The girl who took the food order, ended up placing one late, because she had to step away to \"pump\" .. she was nursing .  Therefore, one of our guests did not receive his food until the rest of us had eaten.  Additionally this is a town of older people with hearing aids.  They had the music cranked up so loud it was hard to talk to one another.  When I asked if the music could be turned down some, the waiter said, \"I am sorry I can't hear what you are asking\"...  REALLY?    Then a couple came in with a child and they provided a high chair.  The parents allowed the child to throw food all over the floor.  When they left, the mess sat there for at least 25 Minutes and the waiter just moved it around with her foot,  did not want to bend over to clean it up.    I believe the staff needs to be better trained and so does the manager of this restaurant for not keeping a better watch on things."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super cold take a jacket even in the summer. The food was good and the waitress are awesome it's just so cold it makes everyone shiver. We noticed all the customers looked uncomfortably cold I guess they have the temperature down because the waitress get hot but  the customers are always super cold"}
{"text":"Our server was Liz, she was awesome.  For appetizer we had the taco white queso chips thing (can't recall the name) and it was AMAZING!  Our orders were perfect and we never had an empty glass.  $1 long islands are you kidding me?!?!  Awesome she kept them coming and we left blitzed and happy.  Great experience."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having a nice quiet meal at the local Applebees, but sadly after placing my order for a probably less than satisfactory hamburger, as per usual from Applebees, our classless waitress decided to entertain the sexual advances of who I can only assume to be a member of the kitchen staff. This went on for several minutes, less than five feet behind the booth in which we were seated. This became increasingly uncomfortable as the low-toned moans of the man grew louder in volume, and her giggly \"stop it\"s and \"you're gonna get me in trouble\"s continued. The final straw was after he bothered to look in the direction of the customers he was disturbing (us), my girlfriend rolled her eyes in disgust. He then gave both of us a look that suggested that the food we were about to be served can't be trusted. I doubt I will be returning to this Applebees. Giving two stars because the boneless wings are alright."}
{"text":"I went to them for the take out option. All I wanted was their steak that comes with garlic mash potatoes and seasonal veggies. I asked for a med-rare, got well done. The mash potatoes had zero garlic taste in them. The seasonal veggies was just broccoli, which is a veggie (singular), they could have at least added squash or carrots. And the broccoli was just steamed, nothing else, no seasoning at all. The staff were nice but they were not at all busy. There is no good reason as to why my food was overcooked and under seasoned."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! My steak was a little more rare than I asked  but to me that hardly matters. The only thing that bothered me was my waitress was really slow. Also she dressed kind of slutty. I understand in a bar for tips or just trying to look good. But there's a fine line that has been drawn and she passed it. She was also SUPER fake. Even when we made an opinion she just smiled laughed and walked away. It was kind of awkward and made me think she wasn't really listening. Maybe why she was a little slow. But all around was a good meal!!"}
{"text":"The service here is spectacular! I always sit at the bar with my husband and receive the best service from DJ and Tye. They are always going out of their way to give great customer service regardless of how busy they might be, they stay on top of your order. The food is always good and the drinks they serve are amazing. They both always have great suggestions. I only drive all the way to this location because of them two, regardless of the fact that there is an Applebee's near my house."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Not amazing, but I've definitely had worse. Just nothing special. But I was particularly irked at their gluten free menu, or should I say lack of. Their gluten free menu was the most irritating one I've ever read. It wasn't a menu, it was the 10 page nutrition info on every single thing they make. So it took me 20 minutes of sorting through to find the very few items that don't contain gluten. We were so irritated we almost just left after receiving our drinks.  And while our server seemed kind, she did not seem particularly knowledgable or caring about the nature of needing gluten free items. Step up your game AppleBees."}
{"text":"food was excellent, i had lime chicken and swapped the pico de gallo for mashed potatoes. small sundaes were a good size and didn't make us feel like we had to waddle away.  the only annoying thing was the waitress calling us honey sweetheart dear baby. ick."}
{"text":"Food was okay.... I got a burger was bland and needed seasoning. I would of be happier with cook out. Took about 25 mins to get my to go order.... Staff was friendly though"}
{"text":"On a Thursday it took 15 min after being seated for us to get our drink orders. The waiter couldn't have been any more socially awkward. Also we got the Spinach Artichoke dip and the chips were SOAKED in what I'm assuming was grease."}
{"text":"Lousy Corporate Food, is how I would describe the Applebee's menu. Watching the meals coming from the kitchen just look plain and boring.  My wife and I have been to this location twice in the past month. Both experiences have been lack luster. Appetizers were poor and flavor and the entr√©es were not that exciting.  Beer is overpriced and rarely has a drink special. Service has always been great but atmosphere and food are definitely not Worth our money.  We won't be back again, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  Got in at 12:30 and the place was a little dead... made me a little leery, but my friend and I were armed with serious appetites.  Let me preface by saying that I haven't been to an Applebee's in ages so the menu had been changed (probably several times) since I had last seen it and it was cool to see some new options on there.  Once we decided, the food came out pretty quickly.  We went with the 2 entr√©es and an app for $20... pretty decent deal for the portion sizes.  We split a spicy queso dip with chips and I got the new Florentine ravioli with chicken.     Overall good experience... the waitress was a little on the slow side (for the restaurant being dead).  It did pick up toward the end so maybe she got a little frazzled."}
{"text":"I broke a rule: never eat at chain restaurants.  The minute I walked thru the door....I knew it was a mistake.  I don't get it. It's not that hard to give a customer good service. I sat at the bar and felt like a non entity. Maybe it was because I'm from out of town, maybe it was because I'm not a regular. Just not sure bit I would have had more fun talking to the chair next to me.  Note to management: suggest you check some of these reviews.....their is a common thread!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. My server Bambi was at best perfunctory."}
{"text":"Ugh.. Either the quality has dumped or my tastes have matured too much for applebees. Fish tasting fishy just doesn't seen right to me, but hey, IM no Gordon Ramsey.. The wait was insane for fish on a Friday during lent.. Tisk tisk.."}
{"text":"Used a gift card here we received for Christmas, that was a mistake. After we left feeling very unsatisfied and still hungry we had to go get food  somewhere else that actually tasted good. Not one person at our table liked their meal, and the waiter was extremely unfriendly."}
{"text":"Okay. So we have not been here in years. I was actually pretty disgusted with all the Applebee's locations. We decided on a whim to try it one more time because the place we wanted to go to was packed.  Well I have to say, it was wonderful! Bailey, was so sweet and attentive to us. We had the riblets and chicken tenders and appetizers. French onion soup too was soooo good.  They have their appetizers back too for happy hour and looks to be a great drink menu!!  We will be back!  Thanks Bailey!!!!"}
{"text":"I work right by this Applebee's. I come here for lunch out of convenience. We just had lunch here today. Ordered chicken quesadilla appetizer for 9.99 and cheese sticks 7.99. The quesadilla came with 4 small quarter pieces. The cheese sticks came with 4 sticks. That is it. Price increase and portion size drop substantially. This is Applebee's. Not a high end place. There are way better places to eat then here at these prices. Ridiculous. Oh top it off, I open my napkin to dirty silverware with a fork that looks like it was used to dig a garden. All crooked. Not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Service here was EXTREMELY slow...  It wasn't even busy. . When the food came out, it was COLD!  Definitely not like the Applebee's on my side of town."}
{"text":"I had a nice time here for my birthday.... the staff, service and food was awesome... They sang happy birthday to me and made me feel special on my birthday.."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it negative stars. This was hands down the worst experience we have ever had!  our waitress was rude and not attentive. We were seated immediately in a corner booth, waited for about 10 minutes for our waitress to come over and ask if we wanted drinks we then waited about 10 more minutes for our drinks-- with no straws. We ordered the 2 for $25 meal. Our tiny appetizer came out and we still didn't have plates or silverware or a straw-- we had to ask, again. We waited about 18 minutes for her to show up with our food... still no silverware. When we mentioned this, she mumbled something and walked away. Literally just kept waiting for them. She never offered steak sauce or anything extra and never checked on us. This place was not busy enough to warrant this kind of forgetfulness. She was lazy, the food was cold and the atmosphere was not good. I will never come here or reccomend. We came a long way from home to visit this area and that was enough for me."}
{"text":"Don't come here and pay full price. The food just isn't worth the money. I'd give three stars to the non-discounted food.  However...if you come here and get the discounted appetizers (after 9:00PM Sun-Thur and 10:00 Fri-Sat, but don't quote me on that, those are approximations!), then you'll end your evening on a high note. Pretty much every appetizer on the menu, except for a few, are $4.50 or $5.00 or something cheap. While they're not revolutionary in their offerings or quality, they're solid and I've never been disappointed. Some of them, such as the nachos, are actually meal-sized...the nachos are my favorite, actually...they're nice and spicy with tons of jalapenos!   They also run drink specials, and the one that they recently ran on the Brewtus was exceptional.  I also like the fact that there are TVs sprinkled throughout the place...if you want a great seat to watch a game, try to get the booth in the back with the big screen in front of it. I watched the exciting ending of a Browns preseason game there and it was glorious, almost like being at a movie theater!  One caveat: if you get cold easily, bring your covering of choice. I have no idea why this is, but this place is always ice cold regardless of the season. I rarely get cold indoors, but man, even I find myself shivering when I go here!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian options at applebee's are really disappointing. On the menu there is basically no vegetarian option besides a grilled cheese on the kids menu or mac n cheese and request no meat. even the salads have meat on them. but the staff were really kind"}
{"text":"Put in an order online. Advertisement on website said $10 off. When I checked out would not accept code for discount. I brought this up when I picked up my order and waitress did not seem to care. Food was good service was terrible."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Comfy place. Ordered a hemlock salad which wasn't on the menu but they couldn't accomodate. Got me some ribs and they were filling. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day.  Beer is cold but overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is always popping . But seriously why is there always just 1 bartender even in the weekends. I don't like waiting 30 minutes for my drink and I have to order my second drink as I am half way through the my current drink."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took 5 mins to before a server showed up. Didn't suggest drinks-apps-food as should have. No specials discussed until after I asked.  Ordered two orders of pretzel app, two orders of wings, nachos and a wrap. Brought one order of pretzels out. She forgot the mustard and gave us blue cheese instead, what? Rest of food came out 5 mins after. Had to ask for silverware and plates for all apps.  Food is so-so at best. Typical chain food, not horrible but nothing to write home about.  Side note- I worked at An Applebee's as one of my first jobs (over 20yr-yes I am old lol). I can't imagine that the training and expectations have changed how to take care of a customer. Clearly this location thinks it is acceptable."}
{"text":"had a crappy day wanted a couple of drinks  went to Applebees with a couple of friends. The food is the food. It is a chain restaurant, but the waiter was wonderful. I was drinking my jack and diets and he made sure I didn't run out. We were kidding around about them having a 3 for $30 (there were three of us) and so he sat down and said now we could do 2 .. 2 for $20, got some of the other staff involved. It was fun and definitely lifted my mood. I totally recommend this place if you are just looking for a local place to hang that is consistent with good wait staff."}
{"text":"Applebee's is pretty much the same at each location.  I could suggest it is the McDonald's of \"bar and grill\" chains.   Advantage - they have liquor.  The food is decent and the portions are decent as well.  The staff is always friendly in a \"pieces of flare\" way and that can get a little annoying.  The drinks are good.  I had a terrific autumnal drink with Apple Jim Beam, lemon and honey.  I fact I had two!  The new \"pub\" items are pretty good portions.  I had the cedar chicken on quinoa and apple chutney.  Not too much food so you don't leaving bloated up.  It is always a reliable place to go because you know what to expect, what you will get and how long it will take.  Consistent which is not bad but it is nothing amazing.  It is your neighborhood bar and grill just like your local McDonald's."}
{"text":"One star because at least the Pepsi I ordered was what I expect it, after having our drinks thrown at us by our waitress, same with our appetizers, we received our main entr√©es(steaks), with a plate presentation that look like a 10 year old kid put together and tasted like a 10 year old kid had cooked, I'm a cook and if I tried to send food out of my kitchen like that my chef would either make me remake the whole meal or fire me for serving  food like that. I'm sorry but when my steak tastes like a tv dinner and looks like one too I have to say something."}
{"text":"ok its been 3 yrs since i have been back my friend begged me to go so i did.. way diff experience this time we got great service and seated quickly, our waiter was so funny i forgot his name but he was so sunburned he said he couldnt lift his arms up! he told us the story about his vacation in cali!!   next time i go i will ask for him, im pretty sure the host will know him. he made us laugh the whole time"}
{"text":"I have been to the Applebee's on Gilbert and baseline, and the service amazing! I live closer to this Applebee's, how ever I will never be returning.   I went with my mother and sister party of three including I, I gave the host my name and I even spelled my name for her. She warned us it was a 15 min wait and I was fine with that. (I work in the restaurant biz so I have grown some patience) anyway, the host was looking for MARK party of 3, no one was responding so I asked her if she meant MARLI. She said I will check. She never got back to us so we waited a little longer, after 30 min of waited I decided to ask her how much longer, she asked for me name and she responded \" I don't have you on my list\" I laughed at her and said oh maybe I was your mark party. She looked back at her list and said oh I could t read my writing. She apologized and she kindly said we will sit you right away.  We got seated and walked up the a dirty table with fries all of the floor and food still on the seats. The male who Sat us said I am sorry we will clean it right now we are just busy. I was disgusted.  I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Applebees for a while now, and finally had the chance to earlier this week.   The service here was great! Our server was friendly, energetic and very funny. Her name was Lori, but she told us, \"just call me Grandma.\" LOL! She made good suggestions, pointed out the popular menu items, and talked to us like we were family. You gotta love servers who are entertaining and likes to make their guests feel comfortable!  My husband and I both ordered the Sizzling Smokehouse Chicken Stack. It was grilled chicken with ham, bacon, and cheese, a serving of cheesy corn with bacon, and two corn cakes. Yum!! We both enjoyed it. The corn cakes were actually very thin, but they were still pretty good. We also shared a Triple Chocolate Meltdown for dessert. Can't say anything bad about chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream! The prices were reasonable as well.   I would definitely come back again! I think the only thing I did not like was that they played a Justin Bieber song, hahaha. (Sorry, no offense to anyone). I hope that the other servers are just as awesome as Lori was!"}
{"text":"I have always liked majority of the food at Applebee's. Don't know what is going on here, but this location is a disaster! Everytime we come here it's crowded and the hostess just can't keep up with all the customers coming in. The last time I overheard someone saying \"I see many tables open here, why are you not seating people?\" Can't remember her name, but there is also one server who is very slow and I believe we had her twice within the past year. She took like 15 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders. After the food got to our table, we never saw her again. Thankfully, they have those pay at the table devices so we didn't have to wait for the check!  The food is usually good and there is a lot to choose from on the menu. Their Spinach Artichoke Dip is my favorite appetizer and is #2 on my list for chain restaurants - CPK has the best one! I wouldn't recommend getting a steak from here unless you want fork and knife struggles or your frustration level to rise, LOL. While I'm at it, thumbs down for serving Pepsi products.  2 stars because I like the food and the pay devices! Won't be returning to this location because they are slow AF!!"}
{"text":"We were seated,apparently, at the time of shift turnover. It took 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table and take our drink orders. She was nice and apologized that no one told her that we were her table.   We put in an order for the drinks, and also the nachos to share. The service was good beyond the initial nothingness. The nachos were actually pretty good! Also my margarita and the other drinks ordered were pretty good as well!   I'm just speaking for myself, but the entree I ordered was a joke. I know Applebee's isn't high end by any means, by my \"New Kicken Turkey Stacker\" was a joke. Two pieces of white bread SOAKED in butter, with a couple pieces of dry turkey and skimpy coleslaw in between. That's it. Buttered bread, dry turkey, and a bit a coleslaw. I had one bite, took it to go, and ended up throwing it away. An absolute waste.   I wanted to give Applebee's a fair chance, and there was some positives, but overall, I was severely disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here the other night to use up some gift cards we had received as gifts. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience at all!   We ordered boneless chicken wings appetizer, as well as the brewpub pretzels. The wings were very yummy, and the pretzels were great too. Great deal on appetizers price wise, but the portions are kind of wimpy. Honestly that's okay though. Let's you enjoy your entree without getting too full.   I ordered the all-day brunch burger and the BF ordered the whiskey bacon burger. Both of the burgers were super tasty, and we both ended up bringing home half as they were too large to finish. The side of fries was really good, too. Nice and crispy and salty. Yum!   Our server was great! Very attentive and friendly. He kept our drinks full the whole time and removed used plates promptly.  I really like the interior of this Applebees, as it features lots of local photos of events and it's fun to look at. There was a photo of some athletes from my home town in our booth, I thought that was neat."}
{"text":"Ordered late and I messed up the order. Thought it was for tonight, but it showed it to be for tomorrow. Damn I am hungry now! So I go over and they were really awesome and accommodating. With 30 minutes before closing, they said they would make the food for me fresh if I still wanted it. They were out of soup and so they offered to let me come in tomorrow and get it. I asked if I could just substitute since I had prepaid. They were cool with that. Never been here before even though it's like 1/4 mile from me. Great customer service. Pretty hopping with groups. Not heavy bar activity."}
{"text":"Ordered food ..waited 20mins for an appetizer that was wrong.. we order buffalo wing they brought BBQ ..my entree was four cheese max and cheese some of my noodles where burnt and hard"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is not a bright spot vegans. However I was able to eliminate some nachos and a double order of steamed broccoli. My wife consumed the boneless wings and the shrimp & noodles plate. Service was average. Just waiting for the franchise to get with the times."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here!!    Was greeted immediately after entering the restaurant.   Drink came out fast ..   It take a minute to get a refill ...  But food was hot!!  & everything was delicious:-). Will be back"}
{"text":"The quality of the food was excellent, the server was very on top of it with getting our drinks and order. It was loud, but that made the atmosphere fun to me. The only down side was the wait to get in was at least 20 minutes to a half hour, but maybe it's to be expected on a weekend night."}
{"text":"We love Applebee's. We frequently sit at the bar and the staff are always friendly and welcoming no matter how busy they are. We are not \"regulars\" but we go there often enough and it's close enough to feel like it's our Applebee's.  If I've ever had a problem with my meal it has always been addressed immediately and without any trouble."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone comes to Applebee's with high expectations,  do they??  Met a friend for dinner here and ordered an Apple Cider, Bourbon Steak with veggies. The steak comes out on a sizzling platter and it was decent. It wasn't overcooked and not overly fatty. Good seasoning, too.   My friend got the Wedge salad and another steak and she said both of hers were good.  It's It's a good place to take kids."}
{"text":"Wait staff was very nice. They weren't busy at all so the wait time shouldn't have been as long as it was for our order to come out. Several food items were \"discontinued\"by the time I got to a dish they actually had I just ordered it and was very underwhelmed"}
{"text":"Went to get a bite to eat and store hours said open until midnight. When I called the only comment was that corporate closed us. When I asked for a reason I got hung up on. I will never step foot is another applebees for the rest of my life. And I'll be calling corporate tomorrow. And the better business bureau as well. Assholes"}
{"text":"I came here years ago, and I must admit, it wasn't good. They must have new management because I came here recently and I've been back regularly every since. I've always loved Applebee's menu. They always have great menu specials that's easy on the wallet. So far this year, I've had great service, the manager always comes by and my food is tasty, fresh, looks exactly like the picture and comes out quick. That's all you can ask for... aside from being clean of course. Anytime I don't feel like cooking dinner, I'm always happy to be a regular at my neighborhood Applebee's."}
{"text":"Andrew and Lola! Give those two people a huge raise! Service. Personality. Friendly. I try to come here every time I am in Phoenix. I am sad if we cannot work in a trip to see them. And yes, the food is great, too."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered carside to go...the chicken wonton app, chicken n shrimp, ribs n fries were all tasty. However, the \"cheeseburger\" kids meal was a joke. My son was still hungry because the burger is a slider..extremely small. Overall the food was good, but I'm very disappointed that I spent 4.99 for the tiniest cheeseburger I've ever seen!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Applebee's in over a year because of previous bad service ..I decided why not give it a try ..Started off with drinks which the server couldn't hear anything we said I guess the music was too loud ..made me repeat myself multiple times .we ordered chips and salsa my server never put in the order..we never got the chips and salsa ..he kept walking past us never even realizing he forgot them..I asked for one of the $7.99 burgers ..it was supposed to have bacon and onions ..I never seen the bacon or onions .server said they were seared in the the burger well I didn't see them or taste them and I asked for my burger to be well done no pink and what to I get ..a pink burger..also my fries were cold ..very disappointing"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for several years and have never been disappointed. Our favorite local door when we don't feel like cooking at home."}
{"text":"I am really pissed. I was there for lunch and when I ordered my brunch burger,  the waitress asked me if I wanted fries and I said I would rather have a baked potato.  what she failed to tell me was that it was extra. like $2.85 . And I think my club soda was $1.85. so my lunch was just about $17. REALLY?  NEVER AGAIN.  A true rip off. Try informing customers of prices for options.  You just lost  a customer."}
{"text":"Just came home from this Applebee's!  We had an excellent dinner and the server Isak was friendly and courteous and a pleasure to talk to. The food we had delicious  but the Cedar Grill Chicken  was fantastic - enjoyed every bite. - what a fantastic piece of chicken and served with Rice and an apple topping!!  Have had chicken at 5 star restaurants before but this was even better - definitely will go back again and have this dinner and sincerely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I usually like Applebees, but this one in Phoenix was awful.  We got immediate seating, but it took more than 30 minutes for our server to bring any food to the table.  We had to flag down another server and ask her to find the other one who had taken our order.  When our server finally reappeared, he was copping a hostile attitude, like we had no right to expect him to bring any actual food to the table.  I had a beef salad.  Underneath the spices I could taste that the beef had already started to decay.  Yuk!  There didn't seem to be any manager on premises.  Warning:  if you pay by credit card, you have to run it through the machine on your table, which automatically adds a 20% tip unless you opt out."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Applebee's. I try hard not to be a chain snob, but Applebee's always ends up being one of my least favorite chain restaurants. So when I was forced to come here for dinner, I was less than excited, but I tried to be a good sport.   The service was nice and friendly, which is always a good start. The food is just ok, the same as every other Applebee's I've ever been to, so not much to say there. Our server was attentive and always kept our drinks filled and made sure we didn't need anything. That was the best part of our experience here.   They do have a lot of inexpensive specials and sitting in the bar area, it can be a great place to watch a game and have a drink if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Two reviews for Applebee's in this short amount of time? My foodie cred is definitely going to slip for that one. I came here for lunch because my coworker had a gift card and who am I to say no to free lunch?   They have pretty good lunch specials, I'll admit. I tried the Asian Chicken Salad with a French Onion Soup. The salad was basic but good and I liked the soup as well, despite it being more beef broth than it was french onion-y. The service was friendly and fast, which is what I'm looking for in a weekday lunch.   I definitely wouldn't be opposed to coming here again since I work in the area."}
{"text":"we were here on boxing day 2014, it was not busy at all, like a handful of patrons only. so, we ordered, our drinks came in a reasonable time, our food......loke OMG it took at least 45min. there were 4 of us, it was NOT a hard to make either, i had grilled chicken...which is really dry and rubbery, i cant say about the others, but it was horrible it was...didnt get refill for my tasteless icedtea...so dissappointed. 2 stars because, at least their alcoholic drinks were good, my sister and bro did enjoy it."}
{"text":"Lunch combo was good with lots of variety.   Service needs a little work. I think we had a new waitress.  She didn't know the menu very well.  Applebee's does a good job of experimenting with different flavors."}
{"text":"Had a gift card from Xmas so decided I better use it, lol. This was last week sometime. Ordered to go from the bar.  Looking for healthy food of course so ordered grilled chicken breast, and double order veggies.  The bartender was nice, young.   Food came and right away smelled like plastic burning.  I looked in bag but nothing burning.  The drive home still smelled the burnt plastic.  When I got home, I opened it up.  The chicken breast was flat, and didn't look real.  No spices.  Tried a bite and my yorkie had a great dinner.   The veggies could have been good.  They were zucchini, yellow squash, and red bell pepper.  Maybe if they were cut in small pieces, they would have been grilled and cooked.  It was like they just took a zucchini and cut it in half and slapped in on the grill for a minute, same with the others.  So these went in the garbage.  So for dinner, I had greek yogurt mixed with Parrillo protein powder and a frozen strawberry, mmmmm.  No more Applebees for me.  But to the waiter, young guy with dark hair, keep up the good work, gave me a to go cup for my ice tea."}
{"text":"First off the management here sucks ass!! The kitchen was so far behind that we sat there for 35 mins and still didn't get our appetizer! The server did all that she could but damn! This place has no team work at all and like I said, MANAGEMENT HERE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN! Fire the sorry asses that work May 1st 2016!!!"}
{"text":"Had a grilled apple lemon chicken & quinoa dish that was not high in calories. It was very tasty &  the perfect amount for mom & I.  Karissa was our waitress & let me say that she is a fabulous food server! She was extremely attentive, very helpful & definitely went above & beyond to take care of us! She is a definite asset to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the second visit 7 months later...did the $40 two can dine...ordered the artichoke dip...it was ok...we both ordered the crispy chicken on mashed potatoes gravy and onions...we enjoyed it...topped it off with the brownie ice cream dessert...portion size was great!...server was friendly anf appropriately attentive. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our server, Anyssa, who just waited on us for our working lunch.  Food at Applebee's is the same, however, she was sweet and amazing!"}
{"text":"The only reason I found myself getting Applebee's is because my parents got me a gift card for Valentines Day.  As expected, the prices were quite affordable for food so my girlfriend and I were able to eat a full dinner with an extra side using a coupon we found online. We ordered our food online for Carside-To-go since it was convenient for us for the evening. Although they said the order would be ready when we arrived, we still had to wait quite some time before receiving our order. I had the bourbon street chicken and shrimp which came with mushrooms and potatoes. It was found it surprisingly delicious and fulfilling. Additionally, we shared grilled veggies which was also a great addition for a balanced diet. Applebee's didn't let us down that evening!"}
{"text":"Walked in, went to bar, sat down and had  ordered 2 ice tea's. Waited 15 minutes, still no drinks or service at the bar. so we walked out and went next door to JC sushi bar and Chinese restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Always come here as well to eat if we don't feel like going anywhere else. I'm used to coming here so nothing super special about the setting. I do like that they have the to go pick ups at the back with it's own separate door so the people that are actually dining in won't be disturbed.   We normally get the 2 for $20 or 2 for $25 deal, but this time we didn't. We got regular meals for once. I got the mac n cheese and my mom got a burger. Both meals look good. Mine tasted good, but after awhile the honey sauce was making me a little queazy. The burger was good (according to mom). She was craving a burger and it satisfied her craving. We did not get dessert before we left. Our waiter was pleasant and was very prompt with ordering our food. Usually we wait some time.   Over all - we will all be back because it's an everyday family restaurant with a bar in it for games or to just hang out."}
{"text":"Walked through the door nobody was there to great or seat us stood there for five mins the restaurant didn't even seem busy even after five mins standing there and making eye contact with several employees nobody came to great us or reassure us that we'd be seated."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I that I have been to in terms of service . In case you want to eat  at an Applebee's try going to the one at Happy Valley as they have much better service. To the restaurant- if the wait staff is not trained properly, the customers will not come back."}
{"text":"My daughter left her toy there.  Went back and they threw it away.  Who throws childrens toys away?"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Hubby and I decided to do \"tapas\", so we each ordered one of the 3 for $13 samplers. Get to try 6 different things that way! The portions are small, but that's because you get 3 different things. (Duh). Anywaaaayy, we got:  Asian Brisket Sliders. Nope. Kinda icky. Least favorite of the bunch. Sriracha Shrimp. Oh yeah baby! Soooo gooood! Crispy spicy nummyness! Cross cut ribs with the Chipotle BBQ sauce. Another definite winner! Tender & deeelicious! Pulled Pork Salsa Verde Nachos. Meh. Nothing special. Lacking in the pulled pork department. And didn't see any Salsa Verde either! \"Double Crisp\" bone in hot Buffalo wings. Hubby said they were quite good, but nothing double crisp about them. (I was too full to try them.) Pretzels with Beer Cheese. Hubby loved them, I thought they were ok. The \"raspberry\" lemonade was neither raspberry'y or lemony. Kinda just pink water. Meh. All in all, we enjoyed our dining experience, and will go back for \"tapas\" again!"}
{"text":"Dominic, our food server, delivers five star service! This is quite unusual for places like these so it had to be noted."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here. I had been to applebee's in other states, and the d√©cor and atmosphere was nicer. They had wooden floors and an open feel. This place had carpet!! Carpet?! That's disgusting! In a restaurant, food falls on the floor, gets stepped on. Gross.. the d√©cor was outdated. After all Applebees is not known for their fantastic food but they are supposed to be known for their fun atmosphere.   Next the service was awful! The hostess not friendly, first waitress not friendly.   The food was gross and clearly frozen, not of the ingredients except the salad was fresh. The steak was gross, under seasoned bad seasoning, over weirdly seasoned broccoli (frozen, you can taste it). The chicken tasted like water, not like good fresh chicken.  To be quite honest you would be better off going to a food truck. At least there would be flavor and fresher ingredients.  Save yourself the trip go somewhere else. Don't spend your money here."}
{"text":"Something always seems to be wrong here. Staff running around with obviously no idea what's going on, drinks are poured very light, they skimp on portion sizes. The old people who are moderately capable of performing their jobs are the Bartenders. I don't ever appreciate hearing staff discuss \"drama\" out in the dining are. He's a tip from a good and beverage manager - save the negativity for your break room, your guests don't want to hear about how one table complains too much or how to got \"stiffed\" from table 65. I won't be coming back here or recommending this location to anyone. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"Their service is HORRIBLE to say the least. If there was a 0 to give no stars, I would give them no stars! I came here with my sister tonight & they were \"busy\" apparently YET so many waiters & waitresses were walking around. Everyone kept saying that they were waiting for the waitress Brooke, and my sis & I had been waiting for quite some time. When we first arrived, we were just told to wait for the hostess to be seating & waiters/waitresses once again kept walking by without saying anything until the hostess finally came by to seat us! They blamed everything on it being their $1.00 margaritas that were causing it to be extremely slow. BIG TIP.....Take accountability & ownership for you guys not having any kind of customer service what so ever! No acknowledgement of your customers walking in. No courtesy for their customers time. We arrived at 12:10pm (midnight) & we understood they close at 1:00am so we wanted to put our order in quickly for food & drinks. That was delayed until 12:37am(midnight) because of our POOR customer service!  I ordered a water with lemon & they brought me a water without lemon and the water had black stuff in it. My sister & I didn't want to chance anything else so we left! Once again, BAD customer service & I rarely give bad reviews. They'll probably say Im just a \"disgruntled\" person....well guess what you guys allowed that to happen. I will not be back, nor recommend this to others! Fair-warning my fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"This Applebee's actually may make me regret calling all Applebee's, Crapplebee's.   The service is good, food was great, and the restaurant itself was spotless.   Other reviews knocked on the waitresses teeth at this location. I say: If you are a great waitress who cares if you are missing a molar, as long as it doesn't wind up in my drink, we cool."}
{"text":"There are far too many places around doing it right to consider coming here where they do everything wrong.  The speed of which the food came out was inexcusable. It started wrong right from the beginning when the appetizers, ordered on the kiosk, took 30+ minutes to arrive during a non-rush period. We were done with the apps for at least 10 minutes before the food came out. Total time from appetizer order entry to meal completion was around 2 hours.  That's fine if you're there to drink and watch the game, but not so good when you need to get back to your family after sneaking off for a quick couples' dinner.  The Manager was quick to fix a mis-fired steak, but even it didn't come out for another 15 minutes (4oz portion). From that point forward it was nothing but excuses. It's admirable that you work the line and do dishes. That doesn't make the problems acceptable. And don't throw the server under the bus by saying \"She's new and needs to learn to enter orders quicker.\" I entered the apps order and watched her enter the entrees like a pro on her kiosk. Your issue that night was definitely the line.  In all fairness, our meal was comp'd and we received coupons for another visit. However, I cannot say we will ever return to this location. We don't mind paying, we just refuse to take another gamble when our first experience was negative to the degree it was."}
