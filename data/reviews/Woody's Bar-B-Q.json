{"text":"The good - the Carolina pulled pork is great in both taste and proportion size. Beans are top notch as well. Eating area is always clean and immaculate. The bad - the bbq chicken consists of a leg & a SPLIT thigh. Hardly enough for even a child. The ugly - the wait staff is friendly although absent minded (forgot to bring drinks and take our order). At other times they are easily overwhelmed with only 3-4 tables. The kitchen is painfully slow. When the waitress says she's sorry for the delay in the kitchen because a table of 6 came in & they're overwhelmed. Counting us, that makes 9 customers total. All the deserts are apparetnly made with 50% whipped cream. I don't like my bananna pudding thinned out with anything OK? The mustard based bbq sauce needs some work (why is it green), the Carolina sauce is really quite good, Beef brisket is 1 inch thick slices, ROUND of all shapes, & about 5 inches in daimeter. It's also consistantly dry - which I can't attribute to its non-rectangular shape. And lastly, the men's restroom door still has a busted door lock after all these months. I would recommed the owner make some changes: 1) add Great Lakes Dortmunder beer, only you and Olive Garden don't carry this local favorite. 2) fix that brisket, think 2\" x 6\" rectangular moist beef with plenty of \"bark\" on the perimeter. 3) take the whipped cream out of all the desserts, they taste great w/o this adulteration. 4) FOOTBALL SEASON - yeah, all my southern bbq joints offer a Sunday special: 1lb of pulled pork (inside or outside cut), 4 big soft sandwich buns, Qt of beans, Qt of slaw. I call ahead and pick up before the game. On a side note, Old Carolina BBQ is gradually creeping northward. Once they expand into Portage County I probably won't be back. Although competition is usually good for the customer, only time will tell. UPDATE 12/2014:  I guess the owner didn't heed any of the reviews and now they're closed - I saw that comin' a good 12 months in advance.  They should have called Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible.  This place was worth saving."}
{"text":"I'm not an 'expert' at bbq places, but I enjoyed visiting this place twice.  I got the half-slab of baby backs both times.  At $9.99 for a half slab (highest priced item on the lunch menu, and one of the lowest for dinner), two sides, garlic toast and an onion ring, I thought the price was reasonable for the large portions.  The ribs were SUPER tender with a smoky, tangy sauce.  On my first visit for dinner, my husband devoured his beef brisket.  The last brisket he ordered was in Oklahoma in June, and he said Woody's was just as good, if not better, and a larger portion for less $.  On my second visit, I brought my mom for lunch.  Though she was tempted to try the lunch special of the day: a prime rib sandwich for only $6.99, she enjoyed her Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich.  It was a HUGE mountain of  well seasoned, smoky goodness.  She was slightly disappointed that her sandwich was served 'dry,' but that was her error.  She ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich when she thought she was ordering the Sloppy Woody - the pulled pork sandwich drenched in sauce when served.  However, all of their special sauces are on the table, so she did enjoy the opportunity to sample all of them, and had fun creating her own 'formula' from the ones she liked best.  She liked the crinkle cut fries, I opted for their sizable baked potato.  I sampled some of Hubby's and Mom's coleslaw; we all LOVED that it wasn't soggy.  Hubby loved it.  Mom and I thought it was a little on the sweet side, but extra pepper and a squirt of hot sauce on the table made us happy.  We were all VERY impressed with the cleanliness and the staff.  The place is pristine.  The servers are warm and pleasant.  And, I was impressed both times when I saw the manager visit each table to inquire about our experience.  As a former server, it impresses me to know that the managers are active with both the servers and customers.  In a time (and an area) where there are many restaurants to choose from, it's the ones with excellent customer service like Woody's that will keep me coming back.  As an added bonus, Woody's offers 10% off your next visit in 7 days if you bring back your previous receipt.  My only disappointment was their lack of fresh corn-on-the-cob.  As I said before, I have not visited many BBQ places; however, I have enjoyed fresh corn at other bbqs I've visited.  Not only is this not offered as one of the sides, it's just not available at all.  They have fried corn, or fried corn nuggets (can't remember for sure).  Calorie counters may not find too many 'lite' options on the menu.  This is a place for carnivores and indulgence in tasty BBQ.  However, I had no problem 'lightening' up my entree with several options such as lite raspberry vinagrette dressing for a side salad (a $1.50 upcharge for one of your sides), a baked potato instead of fries (the butter and sour cream is served on the side), and I was able to keep my meals under @ 570 calories - (a full meal for the cals of one big mac or a small burger and fries).  Woody's also serves chicken and smoked turkey for healthier options.  Vegetarians would have a harder time choosing while vegans have less options.  Granted, this place is NOT a vegan or veg type place, so know this before you enter if it may be an issue.  The baked beans are cooked with meat and served with a hunk of it.  Green beans looked greasy and also had meat in them.  Hubby loved them both.  However, keep in mind that this place does not cater to veggies, vegans, and the like because it is indeed a BBQ - with 'traditional' styled items for a Southern- themed BBQ.    Also, the place is 'country' themed, so there is country music in the background.    Many flat screen tvs throughout the place - I'd bet this is a great place to watch games - smaller and more comfortable than larger sports bars.  Overall, we are all quite happy with Woody's in Streetsboro.  Compared to the other dining options near the Ohio Turnpike in Streetsboro, it is something different than the usual chain restaurants on that strip (that one can find at almost any exit), has reasonable prices, tasty food, and, above all, EXCELLENT customer service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"One word: Ew!  We went there and ordered a variety of meals. The chicken was chewy, not tender, and it wasn't smoked. (There is no smoker there, so the \"smoke\" is a flavoring)  The brunswick stew was no better. It was not made in a way that I had seen before. It contained pulled pork, turkey, and mystery meat that was very chewy (honestly, seemed like chunks of fat).  Fried okra was obviously frozen and just fried to thaw out. Fries were bad. Sandwiches didn't taste good. Sweet potato fries were OK, but not great. Cole slaw was GROSS.  There were several BBQ staples missing: No brisket, no collard greens, no hush puppies, no Texas toast (this place is supposedly Carolina BBQ)  Nothing tasted fresh, nothing was of moderately high quality, no one bothered to eat half of their meals. Service was good, but the service can't make up for a disgusting meal. Save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very very good!  Loved the dallas wings and if you want a mix of great bbq with sassy service this place is for you!  It is yummy and the service is great!  Ribs tasted great too!"}
{"text":"Wings - Good price, nice and meaty.  Wasn't a huge fan of the ranch sauce. Pulled Pork - Sorta dry and boring. Sweet Potato with cinnamon butter - Awesome Baked Beans - Really good, had a big hunk of meat in it. Texas Toast - meh Sauce - I took my order to go and was given two prepackaged sauce cups.  There wasn't enough sauce to even come close to covering the somewhat dry pork.  The sweet sauce was not bad, but the hot sauce was really pretty terrible. The inside was new and very clean. Good sized portions. I rate this place 2.5 stars and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"I went to Woody's twice, the first time i got a sampler platter, the ribs, chicken,were both overcooked with an overpowering smoky flavor and the bbq sauce was sour. The turkey and brisket sandwich were good and thats what i ordered the second time I went.... It was as dry as a bone and their sauce taste like sour crap. I wont make a third visit."}
{"text":"Again, I hate how Yelp doesn't allow reviewers to give half-star ratings. If it did, then Woody's would get 3.5 stars from me.  Normally I don't review chain restaurants, but I'll give Woody's a little praise. We were in the area and looking for something different for lunch, and this place seemed to fit the bill. The location itself leaves much to be desired - a new construction in the shadow of a WalMart supercenter. When we first pulled up, we couldn't tell if it was even open, and almost drove off. Inside was clean and we were greeted by friendly staff.  Overall, the food here is decent, but not rave-worthy by any means. We tried the Brunswick stew, which I was disappointed to find was loaded with lima beans. The flavor was actually really good - I just hate the flavor and texture of lima beans. Also, it had way too much corn which really overpowered the flavor of the meat. Get rid of the lima beans and take out half the corn and this dish would be a winner in my book. The Sloppy Woody was indeed sloppy, but still pretty tasty. The Carolina pulled pork, beans and other sides were all OK, but like I say, nothing to rave about. The best thing about this Woody's was the service and friendly atmosphere. Not a bad place to go for reasonably-priced meal."}
{"text":"This franchise is hidden away in the Walmart parking lot behind Sonic.  It looks like a small place but was extremely clean.  The meat was pretty good, of the few places of BBQ I've tried around the local area, I give this place the nod.  The meat was tender and nicely smoked and it has a good variety of meats for the carnivore in you.    I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place several months ago.  I am NOT a fan of barbecue, so when my hubby suggested eating here, I wasn't all that excited.  I was pleasantly surprised!  We sat at the bar (as per usual for us) and we had the iciest coldest most refreshing beers ever.  I got the barbecue sampler with pulled pork and turkey.  It was great.  The servers were friendly and made us feel at home.  We liked it so much that we have become regulars.  We are there at least a few times a month.  We recently tried the full rack of ribs and fell in love! I am now a huge barbecue fan.  I never knew I like ribs and now I want them all the time.  so glad this place is right around the corner!"}
