{"text":"Just tried this place and it's excellent. We were pleasantly surprised at how great the food is. Homemade, flavourful and so reasonable. I would highly recommend if you like Persian food-a gem in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Truly good Persian food is made at home.  Delicacies such as ghormeh sabzi and fesenjaan require lengthy cook times as well as passionate attention from the cook - which is no surprise as to why these fine dishes aren't usually found in restaurants.  Enter Darvish - a cozy Persian spot just off of bustling Yonge Street - and one finds a slice of the city.  People of various backgrounds, Persian, Canadian, Asian, and American, all in search of fine Persian dining.  This place is clearly a family affair.  A family-run establishment which seems to have a steady clientele of Persian-Canadians and others who seem like this is their weekly home away from home.    Warm bread and appetizers come out of the kitchen quickly and entrees are quick to follow.  Try any of the Persian specialties, such as fesenjaan (pomegranate stew) and gheymeh (split pea stew) or one of their fine chelo kabobs.  Careful attention is paid to presentation as the food is pleasantly brought out to you.  After filling up, treat yourself and your dining companion(s) to a pot of hot Persian tea, which seems to refresh and complete your brief culinary trip to the Middle East."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable and a very nice and cozy place!! Great for a quiet dinner with your favorite people :)"}
{"text":"First off great friendly service and absolutely not rush or pressure.  The food was tasty but lack the smokiness that I would like with the meat.  I haven't had anything else in the area but I'd go back for more."}
{"text":"What a gem! I've walked by this place several times, and finally decided to go there today with a friend that was visiting Toronto. My friend and I both love Persian food, and it was surprising to find such authentic Persian cuisine near College Park! Clean, quiet atmosphere and the food came quickly.   My personal favourite was the lamb shank with dill rice. The meat was super moist and fell off the bone. I loved how they didn't skimp on the dill when it came to the rice!"}
{"text":"I go to Darvish a lot since I live close by and it is absolutely wonderful. This is the first place that I and many of my friends who i've taken there have tried Persian food and every one of my friends has found it amazing. My partner and I got there regularly and the waitress / owner is wonderful and very friendly. The place is very quiet which I love because it takes you away from the bustle of yonge street. It is cozy and very clean, small place with about 8 tables of 2-4 and 1 larger booth type seat to the back.   I love their flatbread that is served as an appetizer before the meal come out! I always get the fesenjoon on the menu (chicken with walnut and pomegranate sauce) and my partner always gets the gheymeh polo ( lentils and chicken with potatoes / eggplant) Ive also had the lamb shank before which is quite filling and personally I like the fattiness of the lamb, it makes it succulent.   I once bought my sister here on her vacation to Toronto and the server gave us a free appetizer on the house, she is one of the nicest people n the restaurant industry, great place for date night =)"}
{"text":"My first Persian food experience in downtown Toronto. Excellent food  and decent service. Amazing flat bread. I will definitely go back. Thanks for having us Sharon / Shaheen."}
{"text":"Excellent place, great hospitality, very sweet lady is there to take your order. Food is amazing and good."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small corner of Yonge & Wellesley, it's a hidden secret. Food is well priced and portions are moderate. I had the Baba ghanouj and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Lovely place to dine. Great service a I took 3 friends here and we all ordered different dish. The food was great portion and we all shared eachother 's food. The food taste amazing.   I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic Persian food."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Persian food, and what a great experience it was! We started with the dip platter - a delicious array of tastes: eggplant, hummus and a yogurt dip with a side of olives. The bread that came with it was exquisite. I was a little disappointed with the flavours, not as strong as I am used to with Greek dips (which this seemed similar too), but apparently this is how Persian food is. My meal was Ghormeh-sabzi (beef brochette in a stew with beans). The tastes were so delicate and savoury. It came with basmati rice (some was saffron). Overall very delicious. My bf got the Fesenjoon (chicken with walnut and pomegranate). Again, very delicious savoury flavours. A bit rich for my tastes but he loved it.  Overall a great experience. I had originally ordered the Gheymeh-Polo, but they were still in the process of making it (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Small cute place. Smiling service. Good food, dishes well priced BUT drinks, tea and small deserts way overpriced. To pay about $30/person for lunch was expensive. Too bad, because the food experience was good."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this restaurant to me .we went there about 9:30p.m while they close at 10, there was an only couple , we asked if they are closed but the only waitress nodded her head as if she is saying \"come in way not \" she was friendly and smiley.  we ordered the Persian taster  plater as a starter ,I ll give it 4 out of 10 and for the mains we have ordered the mixed meat and checkin kebab with rice , the rice was very delicious and fluffy.the meat was buttery for my taste while the chiken was moist and well seasoned ."}
{"text":"Great chicken shish kabob   Ordered off über eats several times and it's been amazing. Very reasonably priced as well"}
{"text":"Hummus and Kashk Bademjan for appetizers were really good. the bread used for dipping was as good.   For mains, I ordered the aubergine stew, it was delicious. We also ordered the chicken Soltani and asked if we can switch the rice and tomato with a salad and they obliged.   Good service and good food, looking forward to more visits."}
{"text":"Had the lamb shank. Delicious. Very cozy environment and warm service. Felt like I was at a friend's home."}
{"text":"Although this place is kinda small, the food and the service are really good. love it!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out after visiting the Aga Khan museum. The decoration in this small restaurant made me feel like I was still in the museum. I ordered the Fesenjoon which is a stew with pomegranate paste and chicken breast pieces. The flavour was a bit like Thai sweet curry but without the coconut base. I liked my husband's order of Chicken and Lamb Kabob better, especially the chicken kabob. The menu says it was marinated in saffron, lemon juice, and herbs. I really liked the taste, although the dish is a bit pricey at $25+. I also tried the yogurt-based drink with mint. The combination of flavour was both rich and refreshing. It was also not very sweet, which is great."}
{"text":"Solid food and dining experience, but nothing to write home about. Good place to go if you're in the area, but I don't know that I would go out of my way just to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Iranian food but after sampling all the appetizers, having a main course and dessert (hey I hadn't eaten all day!) I'm pretty darn sure that this is the real deal. The atmosphere is relaxed and it was good value. And to tourists who end up on Yonge Street I want to say... stay away from the tourist traps and try this place. I think my favourite thing was the smoked eggplant dip appetizer. The waitress told me they charcoal smoke the eggplant. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Very Nice and romantic spot, great food and very hospitable. Highly recommended. Great value for the food they provide."}
{"text":"The food is very little quantity compared to the big plate that it is served on. I think it's a bit over prices for the little amount that they feed you. I have had better Persian food over the years. Would have been nice if they offer complimentary green tea at least even one cup would be appreciated. However, I must say that I did like the set up of the restaurant and the service was really nice."}
{"text":"We stop at this joint a few years ago and the food was slamming baby. I'm not Persian by birth, but lets just say I'm a Persian through marriage. Once you learn about the great Persian culture you will fall in love with everything. My wife found this place while we were vacationing in Toronto and the food was pretty good. We had the typical Persian thing of Chicken Kabob washing it down with some yogurt drink. This was a great find and a very enjoyable place to eat. Trust me I know what I'm saying because this Brooklyn boy loves his food."}
{"text":"The food was horrible, the Ghorme-Sabzi tasted so different (in a bad way), very small portions despite their high prices. I seriously do NOT recommend this place at all if you are looking for a good Persian food."}
{"text":"Peyman the owner is very nice and friendly, He offers the best dish of the restaurant \"all kebabs patter\" the food was great and fresh. I definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"I come to Darvish quite often. While their food is nothing of the overwhelmingly spectacular sort, it is homey and comforting, and that's perhaps what's most charming about this place.   It has become somewhat of a set protocol for my boyfriend and I to come here and order a kashk-o-bademjoon (eggplanty appetizer served with bread), a stew dish of some sort, and a glass of doogh. We tried the kabobs once, but they weren't exactly memorable, so I won't further elaborate on those.  Although I normally love gheymeh-polo, the most outstanding main dish we've tried so far at Darvish would be the baghali-polo. A steamed lamb shank, the meat was oh-so-moist and juicy, falling right off the bone. And of course, the juices from the meat were mmm good with the fava bean and dill rice.   3-stars for food. +1 star for the lady managing the front. Sweetest person ever."}
{"text":"Darvish is my go to spot for Persian food in the city because the food is good and its close to my home.  I am not sure how it compares to other Persian restaurants in the downtown core, but on its own I do like it.  I normally get their khoobide kebab, which is the ground beef kebob.  Its juicy, flavourful and charred just right.  Their fesenjoon is also good.  The dishes come with a sizable portion of your choice of fava dill or another type of rice and charred tomatoes or salad.  I recommend the fava dill rice and the tomatoes.  The server--- the same woman who always works there--- is very nice and the ambience of the place is relaxing because of some really lovely soft music that they play in the background.  Prices are in the $11 to $17 range and given the very large portion sizes it is worth the price.   One star off because I had a bad experience with their lamb shank stew which was too boney."}
{"text":"The food was atrocious! We ordered Chicken and lamb Shish kebab and Koobideh, along with Kashk Bademjan. Nothing tasted remotely as it should have. The Kashk Bademjan was quite tasteless. The kebabs were over cooked and the Koobideh meat was certainly NOT fresh. Both my guest and I had digestion problems afterwards. I'd stay away! There are fantastic other Persian restaurants in downtown. Try one of those; ANY one of those: even a random choice is certain to produce better results than this place."}
{"text":"I tried three of their Kebabs: Barg, chicken, and Kubideh, all of which were great. The food is also reasonably priced, which makes the experience even better!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. I find Yonge street sparse in terms of good options but this restaurant was an exception. We ordered the eggplant appetizer (so good). I had the Koobideh Kebob and he had a chicken pomegranate stew. The mains were decent but a little small on the portions. We both ordered dessert - he had a kind of rose water vermicelli and I had the saffron ice cream. Both were well balanced and tasty. Some downsides were they closed a little early (9pm) and the meal was expensive for the offerings. I understand it's a family run business do likely the reason why - will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good, 3.5 stars would be more appropiate.  Not a huge place which I dont mind but dishes were more all that filling. Food was flavorable and service good for a cozy place.  I had the veal and eggplant stew while wifey dined on chicken kabobs. Overall was good night out..."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel across the street so we gave it a try. We had a very delicious meal. The bread and hummus was fresh and tasty.  I had the Koobideh & Barg (minced beef & sirloin) kabob over white rice and my mom had the Fesenjoon (chicken with walnut & pomegranate sauce) and she really enjoyed it as well.  The portion sizes were good and our server (the one woman that works there) is very kind and gracious."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the fesenjoon. The bread/pita is always warm and delicious. The rice is always buttery and has the perfect hint of salt.  Darvish is a small restaurant hidden along Yonge Street. It's nicely decorated with Persian-esque antiques and decor. The prices are average but worth it considering the love that's put into the food.  What appeals to me more about this place is the fact that it's solely run by a husband and wife. The wife runs the front as the server, and the husband does all the cooking. Coming to local, family run businesses gives you the warm, pampered feeling with that home cooked feel. I always recommend this place to friends. Definitely my favorite Persian spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an incredibly helpful and welcoming staff. I usually order takeout, but I have eaten in the restaurant and the ambiance is great - it is middle eastern and cozy. Great place for some Persian comfort food - the platters are large and the selection and quality of the food are incomparable downtown."}
{"text":"Five of us enjoyed our meals. 3 had kabobs which were seasoned. 2 had stews which were also good. The yogurt with rose petals was nice, as was the yogurt drink. My only negative was the salad quality - just head lettuce& tomatoes; as well as low quality wine. Large quantity of food. Only 1 waitress for the 7 tables in the restaurant but she managed quite well,"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for a quiet,delicious and peaceful lunch.  Best Persian food, wonderful and beautiful owner who goes over and above to make sure you are happy and satisfied.   dishes here are perfection. Over the years I have had them all.  Music is calm and the decor is like being in a Persian home.  Welcoming, and generous with time and hospitality.  This place is the hidden jem on yonge street."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and lovely people, so clean and cozy. The owner served the food by herself and took great care of us! This became my #1 restaurant in Canada from first visit. Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Quiet, cozy atmosphere with delicious homemade style Persian cuisine. The lamb shank is incredibly tender and flavorful"}
{"text":"I live near Yonge/Finch. it's famously known as new Koreatown. If you go up a little north, you can also find Little Iran here.   Now..compared to the Persian food I can get in my area, Darvish is not really worth my money. If you don't live near my area and you want to try Persian food, I guess it is ok to try Darvish. The stores in my area are specialized to charcoal grill kebob at large volumes. A small restaurant like Darvish in downtown area isn't.   There are only so many ways to grill a kebob. From all the kebob places I've tried the difference between a fancy Persian place vs the more casual take out place is minimal. Actually I quite enjoy watching the cook fan the charcoal flame with a piece of cardboard and smell the aroma of the meats.   The Persian stews is one area where a dine-in type place can do better  than the causal takeout places. I ordered a fesejen here and didn't find it much better than the ones I can get at the casual takeout places.   of course, being a dine in place, they have to charge a higher price to cover rent and service. My verdict is...the food here is damn fine. Persian food is one of my favourites. It's just that I'm very practical and only care about the food. If you want to bring a date, then of course you should come to this place instead of one of those Persian supermarkets with takeout food sections. Otherwise if you just want good Persian food, it can be obtained much cheaper in Iranian town. I only recommend a place like Darvish if you live far from Yonge/Finch."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Persian food. I didn't realize that it was more of a sit down place; I always feel like the Yonge strip is just fast food places and hole in the wall dive-y places.  It was a pleasant surprise to walk in to a nicely decorated, if deserted, restaurant. While I had a super late lunch there, they had a few calls for pick up, so perhaps most people just get food to go.  I learned that Persian food is really a mix of many different types of cuisines I'm already familiar. Still, I wanted to try something new. So I ordered the Walnut Pomegranate Stew. It came with pieces of chicken breast in the stew and a side of saffron rice. The prices weren't cheap, but the portion was excellent. I am a big fan of stewed meats and rice, but what was interesting about this one was it was sweet. Generally, the stews I've had are more savoury, and the difference was shocking but in an appealing way. I definitely couldn't eat it every day, but I enjoyed it a lot.  My partner had the Chicken Soltani dinner, which was two kabobs (chicken and minced beef) with a side of rice and a grilled tomato. He seemed to enjoy his meal as well.  I will come back, but it might not be for awhile. That's mostly due to the price and the extremely slow service. The staff was very nice, and maybe it's a cultural thing, but it was as if we had all day to hang out at the restaurant. But again, this could have been an off day or time."}
{"text":"Having been the only Persian restaurant I have tried in Toronto, I love this place and have been here many times.  What I tried: 1. Mixed appetizer: 9/10. I highly recommend this dish if it is your first time trying Persian food. It has 4 great Persian staples. If I'm being honest, I fell in love with Dolmeh after trying it here. 2. Kabob koobideh with rice and salads. 9/10. This too was just short of perfect.  Maybe it's my biases, but this restaurant was amazing and I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Walked by this place all the time and always intrigued so when a gf wanted to get tgt I suggested this place.  It's a small (about 5 tables that seats 4 each) almost look like family-operated eatery. We sat next to this lady who I suspected to be the owner as she was working in her laptop but also helped out the waitress.   The decor is minimal but cozy. There's a cart sitting at the corner which I suspected to be for lunch buffet.   For app, we ordered the house made yogurt mixed with mint and rose petals. It came with a bread basket. The yogurt was creamy and substantial. The smell of rose is wonderful.  I didn't taste the mint so much.  The bread also looked house made. I don't know what is called but it was fluffy inside and slightly crispy outside with the sweetness that's kinda like cornbread. I actually like the bread better with the butter...the yogurt? I could eat it on its own.  I had the pomegranate walnut stew which was amazing. I wish there was more of it coz I had more rice than I can read the stew with.  It has a vegetarian version as well.  For the regular version it came with chunks of chicken. It's almost like curry but with different species range from the Indian ones.   My friend had the koobideh and lamb shish kabob which she liked very much as well.   For dessert we got faloodeh, which is rosewater sorbet topped with vermicelli. This is a very refreshing dessert which I think will be great for summer.   Overall we liked this place.  The only down was their alcohol selection is very basic- beer, red or white, kinda deal. When asked what kind of  Red or white do they have the waitress looked confused. Though I suspect this is not the kind of place for drinks anyways.  They do have a variety of tea. I really wish I had more room to try the Persian tea but maybe next time lol..."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop restaurant but literally one of my favorite spots in Toronto for excellent Persian home cooking.  My go to dishes are the joojeh (chicken) kebab, ghemyeh stew w eggplant, mast o khyar, and smokey eggplant mirzaghassemi.  I've gone with friends who've ordered lamb shank, fesenjoon, and various other kebabs - everything has been excellent."}
{"text":"I was a tourist from Orange County California, where lots of persians live, so I would say I have a good idea what \"good\" persian food is. and MMMMMmmhm, this place was sooo good! I had the joujeh kobideh and tried some of the barg as well. Best persian spot ever!! Super authentic, food made with love!!  Bathrooms were clean so I wasn't uncomfortable to use afterwards (since most downtown restaurant bathrooms are usually gross) Loved the area this place  was in too"}
{"text":"First time trying Iranian food - went here with a couple of friends and got the beef kabob plate. Recommended to try.  Food: 3.5/5, the taste was relatively mild and  complimented well with a grill tomato and saffron rice.  The meat was ok but the rice was very good.  Service: 2/5, just ok, one lady working and nothing out of the ordinary.   Ambience: 3/5, nice little restaurant with cool decor but I could do without the uneven plastic covering on the tables  Price: 2.5/5, ok price, around $20 per person but it could be seen as overpriced versus other similar type of food in the area."}
{"text":"My first Persian cuisine was in Burlington and I loved it. So I am looking for similar Persian foods in Toronto but despite the good reviews for Darvish, I didn't really like it.   I got a Lamb kabob take-out through Ritual. It came with Basmati rice, 1 grilled tomato, 1 lamb kabob and 2 small butter packets. The rice, mixed with the tomato, was really soggy but then it's also because it's take-out, so all the steam got condensed and added water to the food. But that's ok. The worst part is paying $17.99 + tax mostly because it's lamb, but the meat doesn't taste like lamb. Maybe it actually is, but I just couldn't taste unique flavour of lamb...  I will keep on trying other Persian restaurant and hopefully will find one as good as my first Persian meal.  Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Price: 2/5"}
{"text":"On work assignment and my second visit to Toronto, local colleagues took me to Yonge street. We were so hungry and exhausted, dropped in at this cute looking small Kabob place, we were the only guests there.  I ordered the priciest item on menu 2 types of kabob (Koobideh and Barj /flet mignon combo) . Three entrees were on our table in less than 5 minutes, we were surprised at how fast the filets were done. Both meat were dry and rather cold ( ground beef and flet skewer), felt very old & hard to chew, politely told the lady waitress ( owner?) that the Barj was cold & too chewy, she offered to microwave it for me!!!!   I said, I  would try to eat one   kabob as though ordered a single kabob vs two (since I did not want microwave food  without saying it to her)..... She smiled. My companion mentioned that his stew did not taste right. She told us that she had been serving that to customers all day. Three of us basically left our plates untouched . A man ( possibly the husband) came out of the kitchen and sat at the adjacent table staring at us.  The lady came back with the bill in her hand and asked if we were planning to order anything else. We said we were done and felt intimidated and uncomfortable by the whole thing. She stood  till we counted our money and paid as if she had experience with tourists leaving and not paying her ! We were  insulted and frankly cheated. They charged us for three entrees that we could not eat.  Poor service, bad quality food, Shady place!"}
{"text":"I believe this was the first persian restaurant in toronto but what a shame now its the worst. Their kebab is soooo tiny and their rice looks so cheap. I took my non persian friends there and even they were shocked. But their service is pretty good."}
{"text":"The ambience and the restaurant itself isnt much to brag about, but the food is actually good. we we're all pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service of the server (owner)  I tried the kubideh kabab (ground beef/lamb kabab) and my girlfriend tried the Mirza ghasemi( bbq eggpalnt, garlic, tomato and egg dish form north of Iran)  since she's a vegetarian and both were good. the kubide was a bit dry only because it had no/very little lamb mixed with it, but the flavor was great.  Again if you want a high class Iranian restaurant this is not the place to go to, but I personally care about the quality of food and service more than anything else and would go back again if im in the area."}
{"text":"I'll have to retract a bit of my excitement this time around. I wanted to go and get some good persian food that I'm lacking from back home but unfortunately Tempus didn't deliver.  I found their chicken kebobs to be... not what they're supposed to be.. weren't really tasty at all and they didn't serve you like a proper persian place is supposed to! You know, persian bread with herbs, cheese, onions, etc there was nothing!  Also I just realized that half their menu isn't even persian food. It's too bad, I guess for a proper persian meal, I'll have to head waaayy up Yonge street to Little Iran (Yonge and Steeles-Finch area)"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Persian food and I was not disappointed! I had chicken with walnut and pomegranate - it was oddly sweet yet delicious and I couldn't stop eating it! My sister had the lamb shank and oh boy it fell off the bone. Speaking of perfect dishes! The lamb shank is milder than the chicken dish I had but it was still good. Will definitely come back for more Persian food."}
{"text":"What a nice place to meet up with some friends for a Post-New Year's Day lunch! I was brisking it down Yonge street and once I got past the 401 Games store, I had to slow myself down just so I could keep an eye out for the restaurant's signage.  Like alot of the commerical places in most of the downtown core, the inside of Darvish was slightly obscured by the dimness of the windows so it was a bit difficult to see into it. But once I went through the door the lay out of the tables and Persian decor was just like what I had seen in the photos in on here. There was one imprint of what looks like a Sheppard or Warrior on some sort of skin still hanging on the closest to the kitchen. But the one item than stood out was this big oval-shaped vintage looking clock which a couple of my friends just had to point about.   While looking over the menu I had a yogurt based drink called Doogh which has its various counterparts in most other Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries. If anyone is familiar with Lassi then this a more simple version of it.The only thing that this particular drink would need to make it more palatable for people who are new to it is a touch of honey or sugar syrup to slightly sweeten it. I've had another version of it before, including the Lassi and I still have to get used to strong taste of unsweetened yogurt in it.  The friendly and gracious hostess brought us two baskets of tasty looking flat-bread, which I only had the mind to try once our meals were brought over. The bread was slightly thick to-the-feel and the crisp texture of it made me thing of those slender looking bread-sticks that seem to be a rare novelty only in some French and Italian restaurants. But the best and most soothing way to eat it was to pair it up with the dish that I order. This was something that I already had in mind when I was looking at the menu on-line and it was the Aubergine (Eggplant) Stew. For some reason I wanted to try a dish that had some nutrients in it and when I came across this dish and saw that it had a balanced combination of pulses, vegetables and meat, I just wanted to get it when I was at the restaurant. It was also nice to dip the bread into the gravy from time to time and the pieces of veal were big enough to the bite that I could get enough flavor of the meat and the spices and other seasons that were involved in the stew. \"Comforting\" is definitely the one word I used to describe it.  I think every main dish came with a serving of two-colored rice and the Lamb Shank came with a fava dill rice which gave it a distinct green hue and also one of my friends received a colorful garnish of what looked like pomegranate seeds on her bed of rice which a delightful red hue to it. Everyone else's dishes which included a Chicken Shish Kebab and Koobideh dishes also looks delicious and those dishes came with a whole char-grilled tomato, something that I wish was included with my stew :-)  Well, having read that Persian and Middle Eastern cuisine always plays a strong role for the dining culture of the locals on special occasions, it was momentus that my one friend chose our get-together to be at Darvish and the food (and my drink) we had really served that purpose on the second day of January 2017."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Persian place downtown for quite some time. Darvish is just North of College on Yonge, in the spot another restaurant called Tempus used to be. (The shop actually goes by both names: Darvish or Tempus.) It's a moderately sized restaurant, long and rectangular, with an exposed brick wall to your right and mirrors and bench seating on your left. There is a fair amount of seating, so you could accommodate a fairly large group. My wife and I sat at a table for two near the back. We ordered kashk-e baadenjaan to start; it's an eggplant dish I like a lot. I ordered a chicken and beef kebab plate as my main. I always get kebabs whenever I go to a Persian place. It's how I rate them against one another. (I also just like kebabs a lot.) My wife ordered the ghormeh sabzi, which is a Persian stew. We both agreed the chicken kebabs and the kashk-e baadenjaan were excellent, that the beef kebabs were quite good, and that the ghormeh sabzi was a bit watery. I think overall Darvish is a nice place to eat -- the fact the food is so cheap is a nice plus. Most of the mains were around the $12 mark, appetizers were under $7. Darvish is definitely worth checking out.  I've been several times since my first trip there and it's always been great."}
{"text":"The food was ok. We started with the Kashk Bademjan which was unpleasantly bitter with an ungodly amount of dried mint (I have had it in other places where it is smoky and delicious). The bread that came with it was warm but oddly tasteless.   The chicken kebab was juicy and had a subtle flavour. The koobideh was the most flavourful IMO. The lamb kebab was tasty but overcooked. The saffron + barberry rice lacked the fragrance that is often a signature of Persian rice dishes. The portions were more than generous. The kebab plates came with 2 kebabs, a lot of rice and a grilled tomato.  I loved the cozy ambiance and the sweet owner. The service was attentive."}
{"text":"This restaurant was my first introduction to Persian cuisine, when I was living just a few minutes walk away as a U of T student.  My favourite dish is probably the lamb. The basmati rice is amazing especially when soaked in the lamb juice.  I make a point of stopping by every time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant and the food is delicious. Highly recommend the ash reshteh soup (vegetarian). This is a very homey restaurant with a very nice relaxing atmosphere and calming music. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with around 15 classmates, so we took up all but 3-4 tables in this cozy restaurant. My Persian classmate wanted to show us some good Persian home-cooking.  I had the Gheymeh Polo (cinnamon beef stew with basmati rice). It was very good, rich and comforting! Although I must admit I don't have much experience in this area. The service was amazing, the wife of the chef does front of the house and the husband cooks in the back, and she was very nice.  In terms of value, it's around 8-15 for an entree."}
{"text":"Cute, quiet Persian restaurant right on Yonge Street north of College.  Service was pleasant, and the food arrived promptly.  My friend and I split an appetizer which was a dip made from eggplant and other things (I don't remember exactly) served with bread.  For my main course, I had kafta kebabs with a roasted tomato and rice, and my friend had chicken in a pomegranate sauce, also with rice.  The serving sizes were very generous.  The only problem was that, for the most part, the food was bland.  The dip didn't really taste like anything, and my kebabs seemed boring even before I was finished the first of the two.  Fortunately my companion shared some of the sauce from his dish, which helped give my rice some flavour.  He had the opposite problem that I did - he grew tired of the rich pomegranate-taste before he finished.  Overall, not a bad place, and I suspect that some of the dishes are much better than others."}
{"text":"D and I was really in the mood for Persian food. We had previously tried two other places - one was close to College and Bathurst and the other one was in Burlington. This place was close to home. This place is very small, but when you walk inside, you get a welcoming feeling. I ordered a dish that had pomegranate in it. It was really good! I had really enjoyed it. The service is good here too. The lady is very friendly and personable. I think, I have found a good place near home that will satisfy my Persian food cravings and I wouldn't have to go all the way to Burlington."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the appetizers here more than the entrees.  We split some eggplant dip that went really well w/ the bread they gave us.  I ordered a lamb dish served w/ rice which was kinda plain but the broth the lamb was sitting in was good enough to be had as a soup.  Last, the waitresses here are really friendly (and visually appealing as well)."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service..I had the eggplant as an appetizer which was perfect and then the kebbab and that was jst amazing"}
{"text":"I ordered take out and it was very disappointing. Both the masto khiar and shirazi salad were completely tasteless. They could do a much better job, like adding some flavor (salt!) and lemon juice for the salad. Additionally, the koobideh was very dry."}
{"text":"Koobideh is really good. My friend was here for the first time and enjoyed the favabean rice so much that they requested more."}
{"text":"Went to this place recently, very nice sit down restaurant, we got the appetizers and the special stew. The stew was a bit sweet for my liking, but the food was okay, the barberry was nice on the rice."}
{"text":"Gheymeh Bademjoon is excellent.  If you like sweet dishes, try the Fesenjoon.  If you like tart dishes, try the Ghormeh Sabzi.  Other dishes are also very good.  Make sure to sprinkle some sumac spice (available in a shaker on every table, in lieu of pepper) - it has a nice lemony taste.  This food is more unique than other offering on this stretch of Yonge St.  Service is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I hope the owner will take this as a good gesture to help them improve, and I'm not complaining. It looks like a family run Restaurant which definitely needs improvement on the food quality, Kebabs were little over cooked, had grilled pink tomatoes which should of Ben Red. The owner was very friendly, and I think adding a little of Persian culture to their service would go a long way such as Sabzi (Parsley) and onion plus a little feta cheese, showing and presenting the culture it's respecting who we are and the customers. Overall they did good."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with a friend of mine. I ordered a barg kabab and shirazi salad and asked the waitress to substitute the rice with zereshk polo. When she came with the food she said they forgot to substitute the rice and brought me a cup of zereshk (a sort of red sour berry) to add to my rice. I thought the zereshk was uncooked at first but she told me it's cooked. The kabab was so old that my fork nearly broke in it. It was really dry and it was obvious that it's days old. When she came to ask how the food is I was direct and told my honest opinion. She asked if I want something else instead but I just couldn't stand being there anymore so I decline. They deducted a salad from our bill. The waitress was a real lady for doing this, but I have a problem with their cook. This experience taught me a lesson: never go there again!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit this restaurant I say WooooooW it is really my best choice whenever I'm hungry and i need some thing fresh and delicious .."}
{"text":"The food was burnt and dry. Hummus did not have any flavor and the service was very slow. Even the owner did not feel like working. I'm giving it two because I was hungry and still ate the food"}
{"text":"Friendly service, attractive décor, tasty food. The beef kabobs were excellent as was the vegetable stew. The music was soft classical... ok but it might've been nice to hear more traditional Persian or middle eastern music. Maybe they play different music and like to change it up occasionally."}
{"text":"Been there many times, and I like the food. But not the best of Persian food I have had....  There aren't many other Persian restaurants on Yonge, so that's your only bet around there.  If you make a trip to Little Italy though, You'll find a few Persian restaurants that I would rank 4 and 5-star."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Had the steamed chicken leg with barberry rice and the chicken kebab with rice.  It was ok, but the chicken kebab was only available in white meat and I far prefer dark, so it could be much better.    The chicken leg was a little bland but not bad at at all.  The barberry rice was very tart - not my cup of tea but I'm sure a lot of people would like it.  The kebab was quite good flavour-wise - the spices were subtle but nice.  However, it was much dryer than if it were made of dark meat.  The meal also comes with awesome flat-ish bread and butter.  Service is friendly, though not super attentive.  This place is more formal than all the Persian eateries I'm used to going to at Yonge & Finch/Steeles (aptly named Tehranto, lol). The settings are homey, it's a cozy little sit-down restaurant, and the prices are a little higher than the aforementioned places accordingly.  The best thing about this place is the location.  I would personally prefer to trek all the way to Yonge & Finch/Steeles though!"}
{"text":"We were in the area for vacation and wanted to eat Persian food.  Based on the reviews we picked this place.  It was smaller than expected though the food was good.  The kabobs were the best from everything that we ate."}
{"text":"This place is sort of an odd discovery. Apparently better known as a delivery for a local community, it resulted to be a stumble upon place for me.  Kabobs are stunning. Baghali rice is delicious. Overall plates quality is beyond most of other \"mediterranean\" places I've been to. Food is really, really good.  Service is generally ok, though that depends on the waitress - and I have a feeling those are replaced quite frequently."}
