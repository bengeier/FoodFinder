{"text":"I tried the beef brisket, pulled pork and butter chicken pies. My favourite was the pulled pork but they were all good. Each pie is hearty and the pastry was flakey. There was plenty of filling so one pie would be more than enough for me.   The place is on a side road, tucked in the lower level. There are 2-3 stool seats inside but a couple larger tables outside.   Frozen pies can also be bought and reheated later. The to-go box includes instructions on how to reheat the pies."}
{"text":"Life changing pies! I like to buy them frozen and have them for midweek dinners. If you're going to buy fresh pies make sure you don't skip on the fries!"}
{"text":"Bought 8 assorted frozen pies to take home. They are good, a bit on the small side, fillings are skimpy so too expensive for my likings. I can now say been there, done that."}
{"text":"Best pies in Toronto. Great selection, always changing the pie options. Helpful and friendly staff. Awesome fries, double fried for extra awesomeness."}
{"text":"Been stopping by infrequently since stumbling upon The Commish when they first opened.  Love the crust, it's glorious!  The fillings are good but I find the chicken cheddar mash has changed over time, it isn't the same as when they first opened.   I'd love a more traditional, creamy, chicken pot pie in their delicious buttery crust.  Or even an apple pie. A hand sized apple pie, I'm drooling just thinking about what The Pie Commission could do.  Worth a stop and the take home options are great."}
{"text":"Crusts are great - light, buttery, and flaky.  Recommend the beef-based fillings over the butter chicken. Single-serving pie, side, and can of pop is about $12 with tax.  Great in the summer to eat by the car; 3 stools inside but cramped to eat-in. Very tasty food!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of meat and vegetarian pies. All three we tasted - pulled pork, butter chicken, and steak - were very good. The place is created for pick-up/take-out, but does offer outdoor seating with an industrial area ambiance."}
{"text":"We tried the short rib, beef and beer and the chicken and mashed with cheese. All were delicious - savoury and filling. So amazing, so cheap, so easy.   We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were looking online for a place to buy chicken pot pies and we came upon a list by BlogTO. We saw this place and kind of kept it in mind but then went out to do some errands. Along the way, I started craving pot pie more and more. My boyfriend said it was near where we were and sure enough, when I saw it on the maps, it was about a minute up the road. I quickly checked their hours and saw 7pm...looked at the time, 7:03! NOOO. So we went on our way and then I checked their twitter and saw their summer hours were now in, and they were open until 8!!   So on our way back, we stopped in. As I kind of expected for going that late in the day, they had none that were already cooked. But we decided to take 3 frozen ones to go and just have a late dinner. I went with the butter chicken and the bf got the beef n' beer and the beef short rib.   After about 40 minutes in the oven, they were perfectly golden brown and we couldn't wait to dig in. The pastry is really delicious - flaky, buttery, and almost a sweet note to it. I definitely enjoyed the butter chicken, and it had a nice bite to it. My bf said he couldn't pick the one he liked better, as they were both great.   Service was friendly, and I like the signage. And while they don't have a classic chicken pot pie, we'll be back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place through word of mouth and it is fabulous. Etobicoke is definitely starting to diversify and steer away from the average chain eateries. Ive had the butter chicken pie and it was delicious! I could eat just the pastry for the rest of my life. It was cooked to perfection. (+10 flavour points) My second time around I decided to grab the jerk chicken pie, because jerk chicken could not get any better then if it was stuffed into a delicious pie pastry. But the cashier warned us several times that it was super spicy and questioned if we would be able to handle it. Being a jerk chicken veteran, I thought I could handle the spice but she insisted that we wouldn't find it enjoyable..... It was spicy needless to say. I would suggest maybe turning down the level of spice and promoting it as an enjoyable dish, rather than deterring your customers from purchasing your wonderful products."}
{"text":"Quite a treat. First time trying these pies. A buttery crust embracing warm delicious ingredients.  I tried the gentlemans pie. Pulled pork and baked beans. Also, the sweet potato masala.  Totally worth my journey from the east end.  Try a mouth watering pie! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Finding this during a few hours in Toronto was the best mistake, had the seasonal poblano pulled pork, maple acorn squash, kale, and corn pie- words do no describe how perfect it was, the crust and filling are all clearly homemade with quality ingredients, a must have if in the area!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and the pies are great. Plenty of meat and sauce, flaky crust. Delicious. Favorite is the beef braised one but all are good. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"The pies were delicious! I had the butter chicken pie and the crust was so flaky and buttery and the filling was spot on, I would have eaten the filling all on its own. My husband had the short rib pie and it was delicious too. We had a ginger beer and a ginger lemonade, the lemonade was so refreshing on the warm spring day.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the price. Two pies with fries and a drink, along with a tiny individual pie came in at over $30. Yes, we got the \"premium pop\" but for a takeout spot it seems pretty steep. We will be back for sure, but next time we will share fries and split a can of pop!"}
{"text":"Truly bloody good pies! The buttery, flaky crusts are made perfectly. Definitely worth checking it out if you're curious and in the hood. We had the Caplansky and the braised beef. Would recommend! Even the fruit pies are delish."}
{"text":"This place rocks, I've been several times and it never seems to disappoint. Try their specials because they sell out quick.   Fries are great to!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Beef 'n Beer with fries. Pie was great. They definitely have the pastry nailed which is the essence of a good pie. The fries... DRY. (Wouldn't get them again). Service was friendly & quick. Will go back :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding pies!  Savoury, rich pastry and the perfect size. Love the fact people line up by a takeout window in the rain!  They are that good!  Go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Top notch pies with a huge selection of interesting flavours, which can also be bought frozen. The sausage rolls are also worth going there for alone."}
{"text":"I had a better chicken pie. Was good. Will always support authentic restaurants over McShit and cronies."}
{"text":"Got a pie and side to go from this place: butter chicken pie and coleslaw. The pie was pretty good with a nice flaky crust and the flavour of the butter chicken was pretty tasty. Pie size was on the smaller side so would maybe get the fries next time!"}
{"text":"Butter chicken is awesome. Really everything I've had there is solid.  Buy fresh or frozen. Good service and friendly. Recommended."}
{"text":"Sounded a lot better than it really was. Food was good, but not better than what you can get at the grocery store and heat up yourself."}
{"text":"I've had these pies twice. Both times I have really wanted to enjoy them. The truth is I just couldn't. The concept is cool and hipster focused so it seems as if they played the market correctly but I don't know I just do not like the pies."}
{"text":"My first trip to The Pie Commission....I thought, given the confusion on directions, this was going to be an expedition as I am directionally challenged at the best of times.  No such thing...it was actually quite easy to find...east on the Queensway from Kipling, right on Canmotor, quick right onto Queen Elizabeth Blvd. and even quicker right into parking.  No muss, no fuss, and no scenic route!  So much for getting there...now the important stuff.  Since I couldn't make up my mind and actually choose one kind, I bought a beef & beer + fries to eat, and 2 cranberry/apple dessert pies + a 4-pack frozen to go for later --  marsala, butter chicken, chicken cheddar bacon mash, and another beef 'n beer.    First off, the fries are killer, the best I have had in a long time!  No ketchup, nothing (my choice)...and yum, yum right to the last one.  Most have raved about the crust on the pies, and they are right!  Flaky yet moist, and not on any diet menu I have ever seen, with all that buttery flavour!  The filling was hot, and the aroma alone had me drooling to take my first bite.  Nor did taste disappoint...succulent onions, moist ground beef filling every nook and cranny of the pie...then my belly.  Fairly simple, fairly plain...but oh so good!  The cranberry apple I took home (too full to eat it at the time) and ate one cold later in the evening.  Here I was a little disappointed.  The one I ate the next day, heated, was much better!  Heated is the way to go....moister and brought out more of the flavours.  Try adding a dab of whipped cream....yum, yum!  After all, no point in being half bad!  Of the frozen, to date I have only tried the potatoe marsala (an alternative to the veg-ilicius for those who like a bit more punch).  OK, I am repeating myself, but yum, yum anyway!!! Not a vegetarian myself, I just love marsala anything - chicken, beef, etc. - and this did not disappoint.  While I have no idea what was in it (chick peas + spinach + who knows what else), the total effect was spicy and delicious....a real winner! It was easy to reheat (45 minutes tops while i surfed the web) and on the coldest day of the year to date (-22C), real fresh-made, comfort food!  I am looking forward to trying the rest of box.  Going to be hard to pick a favourite, though.  Oh well....life is a challenge!"}
{"text":"I can't even pick a favorite.  I recommend trying the specials whenever you get the chance. I've never had a bad one and have had some amazing tasty surprises.   Best pies I have ever eaten hands down."}
{"text":"Awesomeness! The butter chicken pie leaves a delicious coconut flavor in your mouth, everything was super fresh, the specials looked really creative! Definitely will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Was in a mood to try some place new and Yelp helped me find this one. I read reviews about the meat pies being so good but I really wanted to try their dessert pies. So ended up buying coconut pie and raspberry cheesecake pie..  Coconut pie was AMazINg!!!! I'm definitely going back just for that one pie.  Personally I found the pies to be really small for a good 6$."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place as their logo and advertisements had peaked my interests. I was helped by I think a student and the service was average. Cute little place where the selection seemed mouth watering and then when I ate the steak pie it was certainly delicious. However, shortly after the satisfaction ended as I suffered terrible cramps and had to go potty several times that day.  You have to understand, I have never had stomach problems like that and I'm not one of those with a sensitive stomach. Won't ever go back again."}
{"text":"Have been to the pie commission quite a few times and usually on my way out of town for the weekend. No matter when I go or whom we bring the pies to we always enjoy them. They are always fresh almost as if they were made to order. Will be back there for sure!!"}
{"text":"Can't say no to a good pie.  I had the beef 'n beer, a side of fries and a can of root beer.  The pie crust was great which a lot of people have a hard time making. It didn't crumble apart upon the first touch. Inside the beef was juicy and delicious.  The fries were surprising though. Some of the best I've had in a long time. A real person actually made them fresh. I'm sad that it isn't the norm.  Overall for $11.something my fatness was quite happy."}
{"text":"A truly original spot in today's burger driven Toronto. Perfectly cooked, buttery flaky pies filled with  perfectly seasoned fillings. Beef rib is epic. Fries are bang on and the inclusion of tahiti treat brings back memories of childhood. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The rating says it all. If you visit this place and don't agree with me, consider reassessing your mental health or the fact that you probably don't like pie. Everything was great, from the cost, to the taste, to the customer service. Well done."}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times over the past year , and the pies are very good, I do have to say the braised beef was a tad too sweet for my liking, the fries are good but could be more Crispy and be a tad more flavourful they are just a little bland. The chicken cheddar mash is fantastic and so well balanced, the inclusion of leeks is the addiction that really makes this pie stand out. I also think the pie crust is extremely well made and make these pies something special. I would definitely recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Probably the best beef pie I've ever had. It wasn't terribly big, so if you're hungry I would definitely grab a side with it."}
{"text":"I made a special journey to try out their pies, I wasn't disappointed, but I wont be making a journey from Brampton just for the pies, maybe if I'm passing by, I'll pop in again."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if they had gluten free options. Everyone I've sent here says this is the best meat pie in town."}
{"text":"What do you get when you mix tender braised beef, a tart baked with loads of real butter, and steaming veggies with jus? The ultimate comfort food Lovely large salad on the side makes it a little less of a guilty pleasure Kids gobbled it up too - along the crispy side order of fries  Affordable, and love the recyclable paper packaging"}
{"text":"All the pies are fresh and absolutely amazing! This is not a typical frozen mass produced pie, these are truly gourmet style pie that will totally meet or exceed your expectations! You have to try one, they are all delicious!"}
{"text":"I really really loved the taste of their pies! I've had the butter chicken and pulled pork pie. Both were amazing, I loved every bite. The crust is so delicious and the fries!! So good.   I just wish I didn't get food poisoning from the pulled pork, because of how delicious it was. Could have just been a bad day for that pie but now I can't go back. The taste has been tainted. :("}
{"text":"We came here after a 3 hr tree trekk and ordered almost every pie on the menu. Savoury and sweet. It was worth it. My favourites are the butter chicken and the braised beef for savoury and espresso cream and peanut butter for sweet. I absolutely love the flaky pastry. It's a must try. Too bad they didnt have a sit down, but that's not a dealbreaker at all."}
{"text":"This is one of those little gems that over-delivers on expectations. I had the (seasonal) beef and squash pie. The filling hit all the 5 tastes a little sweet, a little crisp, a little bitter, a little salty with a hint of umami. The crust was... crusty with generous use of butter."}
{"text":"Tried the braised beef, beer and beef, and butter chicken pies.  The braised beef was my favourite.  Not sure I would order the beer 'n beef, but that's only bc the braised tastes heartier and I'm not as big a fan as the ground beef arrangement.  Butter chicken is also another one I'd keep ordering again.  Will look forward to more visits ... so happy that we're finding more and more good eats in Etobicoke!!  On a side note, it's great for kids because across the street is this park that kids can always play at!    Oh yeah, we also ordered fries ... amazing too!!  What a great combo.  Last but not least, for anyone looking for Tahiti Treat soda, they sell them there too.  Brought great childhood memories :-)"}
{"text":"Very good pies I had the cheese and steak pie and by boss had a veg one. Delicious pies but VERY HEAVY there is a lot of butter used. so if you want a hearty meal this is the place you want to be.   I took off 1 star because one of the veggie options that they list is not available for order. It comes frozen and you have to bake it at home or wait 20-30 mins for them to bake it. They should indicate that on their menu."}
{"text":"Have been picking up meat pies form The Pie Commission for quite some time. Have tried many different combinations and have never had one that I wasn't completely satisfied with. My favorite to date is the one with braised beef. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Pulled pork .,.. Can't be beat!!!  Hubby came home with a wide selection of pies tonight but I have to say the pulled pork is amazing.  I have tried many of the different options and this is pretty high on my favourite list."}
{"text":"I actually went out of my way (from downtown) to journey here to try these meat pies. It was worth the journey.  I carried the pies to a picnic in high park and they generally held up well. We didn't eat them immediately (our mistake) so the fries were soggy and bland by time it was \"dinner time\". The pie itself was delicious! We both had the beef brisket (?) pie. There were healthy chunks of beef and the pie shell was still flaky.   Yum."}
{"text":"Flaky, savoury pie heaven! Incredible pies to be had here. Had four pies: beef brisket,  butter chicken, pulled pork, and the banilla dessert pie.  The beef brisket pie is absolutely incredible and full of flavour, definitely the all-star. The butter chicken I actually didn't enjoy much as I thought it quite dry. It really underwhelmed me, though the crust was perfect. The pulled pork pie definitely did not skimp on the meat. It reminded me of bbq potatoes chips in flavour with wonderfully rich pulled pork.  I also tried the banilla pie and though am not one for desserts,  was blown away by it.   Highly recommend 3/4 pies here. I wouldn't personally go for the butter chicken simply because the rest of the options are head and shoulders above it."}
{"text":"First time here, fantastic meat pies! We had the steak and cheese, and braised beef rib pies.  The fries are tasty too, looks like the use a sea salt.   Only complaint is finding the place, you need to drive around to the back of the building."}
{"text":"meat pies are a tough idea to bare. I thought I was going to get apple or cherry or something peaceful and in the end it was not applicable. the amount of people excited about their jerk chicken makes me question our cultural values. I had to peace harder than luke after he realized he kissed his sister."}
{"text":"Awesome meat pies.  We've picked up hot and fresh a few times, and they are delicious.  We also just recently bought some to take home (uncooked), and served them to family.   They are just as delicious this way too.  Beef and beer is a personal favourite, followed closely by the delicious and unique butter chicken.   I find that the fries are done very nicely, but are almost too much.  Funny little location, but it seems to work.   They should start staying open late on Fridays & Saturdays - they can capitalize on the movie-going crowd!"}
{"text":"Read a few reviews on this, gave it a try, and I WAS NOT Disappointed. I went with my coworkers in Jan, winter! No seats! -10 outside. We sat outside and finished our pies with satisfaction.   Wish I found out about this place earlier. This is a must try once, at least once.  It mainly does take outs. Con for customers, pro for business."}
{"text":"Lovely pies. Best pies I've had that rival hand held favourites from Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Warning, delicious pie juices will seep through the flimsy pie-holders they give you onto your pants.  From the walk-up window I tried the warm-from-the oven beer and beef and the butter chicken ($7 each). Both excellent , though the butter chicken could have been spicier. Happy to see that they had HP sauce for the beef pie. Bought fries which were nice enough but got cold as I filled up on delicious pie."}
{"text":"We have had pies of all sorts from the pie commission since it opened. We often take frozen ones home or to friends and family. They are very good when cooked at home as the cooking instructions allow for an excellent crust. The butter crust is the selling point. It's fun to try all the seasonal pies. The pulled pork is excellent, love the smoky sauce!"}
{"text":"I loved my veggie pie. Husband loved his beef pie (I thought it was alright). It almost doesn't even matter what's inside these little guys though b/c the crust is fantastic."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday. The staff were really friendly and accomodating I was a first timer. Everyone else that came in were regulars and all agreed anything off the menu was amazing.   I got the pulled pork pie which I ate immediately and a steak and cheese to heat up at work later for dinner. The pastry is so good and the flavor of each pie very delicious.   I was expecting to be fumbling with a knife and fork while driving but was very impressed with the packaging that allowed me to eat it like a burger ONE-HANDED. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Pies are fantastic especially the savoury types! Butter chicken is a personal favourite!"}
{"text":"Ok so that was definitely the best pie I've eaten. I had the braised short rib and my husband had the chicken cheddar bacon mash and both were absolutely delicious.   We liked the flavour of the short rib but the creamy texture of the chicken pie was really nice. You can taste the butter in the crust and it was ever so flaky. Yummy.   For dessert (we had to wait in between because too full), we had the caramel apple cheesecake pie which was equally mind-blowing!   Can't wait to go try some of their seasonal pies!"}
{"text":"Great scratch made pie both savory and sweet. My favorite is the braised beef. Personally would pass on the Indian inspired pie they lack flavor and authenticity"}
{"text":"This place was very hidden, I used to live in the area so I'm familiar with the streets and was able to find it. It's a small place, hardly any space to dine in. There are a few patio chairs and picnic table outside (but not when it is cold). I ordered the butter chicken pie, no sides as I already feel guilty eating a pie for lunch. The thing with me about pies is I actually like the crust more than what is inside. And the pie crust is so delicious for this one, flaky, buttery, yum. The filling of the butter chicken was good, not too spicy but I only wish it was a bit more saucy cause I love the butter chicken sauce. My pie was kind of dry. The pie might look small but it is definitely enough to fill you up. It also comes in a cute cardboard sleeve that fits the pie perfectly."}
{"text":"Maybe I came here on an off day as I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. I had the Chicken Cheddar Bacon Mash and aside from the flaky pastry ( which really is delicious) the pie was pretty bland. I was expecting globs of stringy, melted cheddar cheese but really couldn't taste the cheddar at all- i guess it's mixed in with the mash? Also there were no bacon bits or bacon taste in the pie which was disappointing. On a positive note, the Mr. ordered the Steak & Cheese pie and loved it- lots of tender brisket and flavour."}
{"text":"Take it from an Australian - these are tasty pies! The classic Beef 'n Beer is exactly what a pie should be. The Braised Beef Rib is delicious, and reminds me of the home-made pies available back home, with delicious gravy and big chunks of beef. Their dessert pies are also quite genius, with some classics (Banana Cream, Apple Crumble) as well as some inventive and interesting flavours such as the peanutbutter cup which is filled with tasty peanutbutter cream and topped with chocolate. The pastry is flaky and delicious, well cooked, and holds its form beautifully (though the little pie pans are a welcome addition for those not accustomed to eating them by hand). Eating in at the Dundas St W store is always a delight, and the take-home frozen option is perfect for when you just want to sit at home and do some good old fashioned pie binge-eating."}
{"text":"YUM!!!  The pies are tasty, the crust is amazing and the price is fair - what more would you want?!?!?  I tried the ribs and the jerk chicken. Both were excellent!  Even the service was great, friendly, fast, efficient.  Love, Love, Love."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Had the jerk chicken pie and grabbed a 4 pack of frozen for later. The crust melted in my mouth and the filling was tasty. The only thing was the heat. Wasnt expecting that much of a kick!! Will definitely make this a regular place to visit."}
{"text":"So much flaky, buttery goodness. I wish they had more vegetarian options, but the Vegilicious pie was pretty damn fantastic. Goat cheese inside a warm, flaky crust? You can't go wrong. They're a bit hard to find, but there is signage everywhere to help direct you. Can't wait for my next visit ;)"}
{"text":"The Bloody Good Pies are  finally here in the city!  No more need to venture out to The Queensway location because they are officially opened on Dundas St. West at Claremont just west of Bathurst.  When I saw the sign last week while running by, I was so excited! They took over The Happy Hooker location, (fish and chips place that closed last December) I think this will be one of my new favourite neighbourhood place.  There's definitely a savoury pie for everyone's palates from carnivores to herbivores, plus additional sides of fries or salad or coleslaw for $3.95. A complete meal in a lovely packaged box, this could absolutely be my new happy meal! :)  For my first pie at this location, I ordered the braised beef rib ($8.45), the first pie listed on the blackboard. Omigosh! It really was as good as it gets.  The crust was nice and flaky, they definitely didn't skimp on the butter. The filling was plentiful with lots of tender chunks of beefy goodness, mushrooms and potatoes.  It was so moist and flavourful because the meat was simmered in red wine (no complaints there). I just savoured every mouthful.  In addition, the home cooked fries were simply delish with the right amount of salt and was so tasty alone.  There was no need to slather on the ketchup. So much for my meatless Monday today.  They also have desserts, a selection of five sweet pies and cookies available for those sweet tooth if you still have room after your meal or just order to take home. I still had room for dessert, so I ordered the triple berry crumble pie.  Lucky for me it was on the house since they were closing for the day.  What a nice treat and it was definitely delicious just like the caution on the box.  Limited amount of seating with nine stools around the window and wall and a small table with seating for four.  They also have two benches outside with side trays that were custom made for the pie boxes.  Now that's ingenious. Location is extremely close to Trinity Bellwoods Park, so why not have it to takeout and have a picnic in the park.  Service was absolutely amazing!  I was welcomed very warmly by Olivia upon entering.  She was such a doll with her bubbly and friendly personality. Plus she had the same tone and friendliness with every customer that came in while I ate there.  I'm already looking forward to working my way down the list of pies both savoury and sweet, so what are you waiting for? Go get your bloody good pies before it gets busy."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to the Pie Commission for over a year. I went after my Costco run on my day off and picked up three pies for the wife and I.   1. Braised Beef - excellent. lots of gravy and beef  2. Pulled Pork - filling was too sweet and dry (worst of the three) 3. Butter Chicken - surprisingly pretty good and actually tasted like indian food  I've been to Kanga, which is a downtown Aussie meat pie shop and much prefer Pie Commission. Their menus are very similar, so I guess both are pretty authentic.There seems to be a lot of overlap in menu items as three of their options were beef pies and all sounded very similar to each other. I would have bought 4 pies but not enough unique selection.   Also, the size of the pies are kind of awkward for meals. One pie isn't enough, but two pies would be too much.They need to either make them smaller and charge less or make them slightly bigger and charge more.   Parking was limited and had to park in an adjacent factory lot. Weird.  Not bad, but not sure I'd go back. Maybe uBer eats."}
{"text":"Seriously bloody amazing pies! Crust is super buttery and flakey and just incredible with each bite!  I had the butter chicken pie and was savouring it till the very end!  Not to mention their logo is super hip. Who could resist that moustache?"}
{"text":"Great savoury pies, period. Etobicoke residents, you are a lucky, lucky bunch.  Take-out service only where you stroll up to a window and order your pies, hot or frozen to bake later. The staff are a friendly, cheerful bunch.  Had a braised beef rib pie and ate it on one of the four red Adironack chairs with quite the Etobicoke view (factories, warehouses, car garages, etc.) There's not much ambiance, but the pie more than makes up for it.  The braised beef rib filling is just saucy enough and is punctuated with whole button mushrooms, chunks of potato (or turnip), and little bits of sweet potato. The crust stands out with its buttery aroma and good level of flakiness.  Location-wise, it's not really on the Queensway, but rather, situated on Queen Elizabeth Boulevard. Not much parking. There's a gravel strip in front of it which allows for max 4-5 cars."}
{"text":"Like my picture caption says ****** My first order and pleasantly very impressed!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great pies. Just go. Great value. I can't imagine how much busier they'd be if they were located on a main strip road."}
{"text":"Why did I not try this place earlier???  We would have saved countless nights of figuring out what to eat for dinner.  We finally decided to try The Pie Commission for takeout. I called in ahead of time and ordered 4 of their savory pies and 2 of their dessert pies. The total bill came to around $40.  The woman on the phone was very helpful in explaining the pies, her recommendations, and what pies are most popular with customers.  My husband picked the pies up and he threw them in the oven (roughly 40 minutes cook time) later that night.  They were amazing!!  What makes a great pie, for me, is the crust. And I can say that this place has the crust down perfectly! It is lightly flaky, crunchy in some parts, and not overbearing. Just perfect.  If you are a beef eater, I highly recommend the Steak & Cheese.  Next after that, I liked the Beef & Beer. But really, all of the pies that we had would have made a delicious meal on their own.  Also, you get a lot of punch for the price. These pies might look small, but they are mighty!  They are incredibly filling. One is enough for someone who has an average appetite, like myself. Also, I have no problems with their pricing - it was well worth the $ that we paid.  The dessert pies are equally as great.  I loved this food! Hence, my 5-star review. I will be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"Oh they're good.  Fresh, ready to eat, or frozen - these things are killer.   I usually just get a box of whatever is featured (usually 4 or five at a time) and eat them later. 40 min in the oven around 375, and you're so golden.   You will like this place, even if the crust has so much butter you will weigh 2lbs extra after consuming it."}
{"text":"The \"downtown\" location of The Pie Commission is open and it is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. There are a few pot-pie places in the city right now but TPC is the best.   Honestly - this place is a gem. The frozen/or freshly made pies are a must have in your freezer. 45 minutes and you've got a piping hot and delicious meal (impress your guests!). The baked to order ones in the shop are delicious. The ingredient combinations are always exciting and the specials keep me coming back regularly. The crust is unbeatable.   Yesterday I picked up (average pot pie price is $8):   Beef rib (braised beef, veal stock, mushroom, sweet potato) Sweet potato malasa (chickpeas, kale, onion, tomato) Butter chicken Meatball (this one tastes like an Italian restaurant baked inside a pie crust)  The big difference between this TPC and the original on the Queensway is that this new spot has indoor seating and a liquor license. So now you can dine in and get drunk on pie-crust and Great Lakes Brewery beer (looks like that is currently the only option).  PS  The sausage rolls ($4.50) make an excellent appetizer to share (try it with the banana ketchup).   Currently closed Sunday but open the rest of the week from 11-8pm."}
{"text":"Very good pies and great fries!   I love this place I've ordered it many times on uber eats and most of the time comes hot and tasting great."}
{"text":"Went to Pie Commission to pick up some pies with with my girls. After my daughter decided what pie she wanted. I was told they sold out. So I  ordered a different pie. I ordered one braised beef rib and two pull pork. When I got home to eat I open up the pie box and realized I got one pull pork and a totally different pie I never ordered. Don't get me wrong the the pies they make at the Commission are delicious. This was my first time there probably will not be my last. I only wish they made bigger family style pies instead of buying three of four different pie."}
{"text":"Nice small little place a little off the beat and path (just off The Queensway) in Etobicoke.  Fantastic variety of meat (and veg) Pies made fresh daily.  Only negative is there is no inside seating but there is some outside seating which is great for warmer times of the year."}
{"text":"Amazing hot savory pies bursting with flavors and accompanied with a flaky buttery crust. Mmm mmm  mmmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"I've tried most of their pies and each are equally delicious. That is my review. So stop \"Yelping\" and head on over to The Pie Commission!"}
{"text":"I never was a fan of pies until I tried the ones from the Pie Commission. The pies are out of this world! The crust is so buttery, flaky and tasty. My favorite pie is the braised beef. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  They use really good ingredients and are generous with the amount of meat that is in the filling. I usually buy a four pack that's frozen but these aren't not your typical grocery store frozen pies. So gourmet and delicious. This place will make a pie lover out of you."}
{"text":"Tried the Beer and Beef, Braised beef and Coconut pie.  All were delicious!  They are easy to pop in your mouth with no knife and fork needed, the slide out package it comes in is perfect! I only found out about this place because Yelp randomly emailed me about Meat Pie places and this was right down the street from me."}
{"text":"The Pie Commission is an Etobicoke faithful. Tucked away behind side streets at the intersection of Islington and Queensway, it is worth the hunt!  I have tried many of their pies. Some of my faves include the butter chicken, steak and cheese, and their chicken pie. The crust is buttery and flaky, and they are always hot out of the oven.  On occasion, I will pick up a few frozen ones to bake at home. They are typically 7-9$ for each pie, however if you buy 4 unbaked, you end up getting them for about $7/pie and you can choose any one!  I will try the dessert pies in the future!  Note: Hardly any seating for dining in, the place is tiny! Take your pies and eat em' at home. They stayed warm during my trek to Mississauga.    They recently opened a second location on Dundas St .W in the Trinity Bellwoods area."}
{"text":"The best in guilty pleasure eats!  Love coming here for lunch and always grab a few frozen pies to go.  Staff is very friendly and keep everything moving, even when they're extremely busy.  Check it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The most tasty steak pie ever made, a true gem on king street west. The selection of savory pies is extraordinary and I definitely will be back to try them all."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the pies from The Pie Commission. Every now and again I'll grab four pies to keep in the freezer and cook them for lunch on weekends. They always come out perfectly crisp and flaky, and make a great comfort food meal.  My personal favourite is the chicken cheddar mash, but they are all great to be honest. The beef rib is off the charts and I'm also a fan of the beef and beer, but it's a little on the bland side so I usually add a little hot sauce. The menu changes pretty frequently so it's difficult to get bored.  Having said that, it's not a cheap meal by any stretch (close to $10 each with tax) and the pies aren't exactly huge. I'd love if they were open on Sundays but I get that everyone needs a day off.  Tip: I always buy four pies to put in the freezer and ask them to put them in two smaller boxes rather than one big one. It makes it easier to fit in the freezer and defrost two at a time."}
{"text":"This place is well hidden. It's off the queen sway near some residential and industrial buildings.   I came here because I saw all the great yelp reviews and was looking for something different to try with my boyfriend before we caught a movie at the queensway Cineplex.   I ordered the butter chicken pie with coleslaw and my boyfriend opted for the traditional beef pie with fries. We had water for drinks and the peanut butter chocolate pie for dessert. For all three pies and drinks it came to about $35.   The good: The pie crust was flaky, not overlooked, and not too thick The butter chicken was nice and saucy and had a good kick to it. The flavour was interesting to try at first but it worked in the pie crust. The pie sort of reminded me of a very buttery naan.  The beef pie was also to standard as it was not too dry and still had a lot of the juice retained from cooking and being kept warm Service was quick, but mediocre. Nothing to hate but nothing to love.  The bad: There is no where to eat inside so if it's winter and you're here you're shit out of luck unless you want to freeze outside while warming your belly up with pie The coleslaw was too creamy for my liking and the cabbage was not shredded thinly enough so it made it awkward to eat. So go for the fries.  There is also no parking. I think there was a totals of 3 spots. All of which are taken. And if you go in the winter, guess what? People are gonna park their bottoms and eat their pies in the comfort of their cars! So you have to park across the street at the industrial building or illegally on the side near a oddly placed residential neighbourhood.  The purchase area is really small, so you might have to wait outside in the cold for you pie when it gets jammed with people.  Our peanut butter pie was too sweet and didn't really suit the crust it was in. This filling I salute but not in combination with the crust.   Overall, good homemade pie, bad location, no seats. And If you're adventurous try the different flavours!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of meat pies, I made the trek all the way out to the Queensway for this spot.   The decor certainly doesn't disappoint, with a very fun and modern design aesthetic. Cashier was also very helpful in answering my questions about all the pies.   I got the Oka pie, with Oka cheese, chicken breast, and red peppers. The taste somewhat resembles a chicken pot pie, but is much better, with huge chunks of chicken and a cheesier taste. Crust was also exceptional.   Compared to the Pie Guyz in Brampton, I would say the crust and price is about the same, and as for fillings it's up to personal taste. If you want a more South Asian and South African feel go for Pie Guyz, if you want more of an Anglo and Aussie feel, come here. I would personally go to both again."}
{"text":"Lobster and shrimp pie is the bombbbbbbbbb! So tender and flakey and full of meat!   Fiancé had the chicken with mashed potatoes and was less impressed. I don't think it's the pie's fault. Instead of sauce it had mashed potatoes so he was really missing the sauciness of a traditional chicken pot pie.   Overall would definitely come back!   Another highlight is their fries! What a big surprise! Must have!"}
{"text":"The pie commission.  Walking into the pie commission is like giving your olfactory senses a spa day.  The smell of baking meat pies literally makes u think ... \"Why is this not a scent I can buy as an air freshener?\"  My first stop at the pie commission was an interesting one , because I was in Toronto working . I Yelped \"best restaurants near me\"  This odd sliver of a restaurant popped up. I immediately thought , \" Meat pies ?\" Delicious !  There are no places in Alberta that sell delicious meat pies . Sometimes you'll find them at pubs but not a stand alone pie place. And if you do find them they usually own sell \"Shepards Pie\" The pie commission had over a dozen savory pie choices !  The problems were it closes at 7pm. That's right 7pm.  I had to grab a cab after my training course and have the cab waiting to take me to the airport .  Knowing my timeline would be tight I called the pie commission ahead of time to have my pies ready.  That is correct my pies, as in multiple.  I knew I wouldn't be back to Toronto anytime soon so this would be my one chance for meat pies .  I called ahead and talked to westjet and the security at the airport .  \"Can I bring a frozen meat pie through security?\"  I'm sure I must have made them all laugh that day. The answer is yes , you can indeed bring frozen meat pies through security in your carry on. The only caveat is \"no liquids \" or \"gravy\"   When I pulled up at the pie commission they had my hot pie Andy frozen pies ready.  The frozen pies were double wrapped and didn't leak.  Total for 5 pies $40  Knowing I've got frozen meat pies from pie commission waiting to be eaten ? Priceless !  #piecommish"}
{"text":"For pie noobs like me, don't be fooled by the diminutive size of this pie. You will start feeling your stomach shrink with each delectable bite.  The beef rib and smokey beef pies were baked to perfection. I join the chorus of majority of reviews on this place, the filling is Scottie Pippen to the crust's Michael Jordan. In other words, the combination will take you to the culinary Promised Land. :)"}
{"text":"What? By far the best pie of my life. Got the vegetarian and it was delicious , the presentation of the food is amazing and they use recycling paper for everything so they get 5 starts for helping the environment. It is a hard place to find, and although you will probably never hear from them unless a friend brings you. This is the best. And you are lucky for finding this place."}
{"text":"I ordered from The Pie Commission for lunch the other day and honestly it was really good. I had the braised beef pie with coleslaw and fries. The crust on the pie was fresh and flaky, the filling was plentiful and full of flavour, the coleslaw was crunchy (could have used a bit more salt) and the fries were good. All in all i will be going back."}
{"text":"Where do I start?!  The Pie Commission offers ultra premium cuts of Canadian meat, fresh produce and homemade beef, chicken and vegetables stocks, all enveloped in a dangerously delicious all butter crust.   What's great about The Pie Commission is that you can enjoy a personal pie on the go or take home a frozen one for dinner. It's a great option that I will definitely consider the next time I stop by.   The prices are fair for the quality of the food. Around 10 bucks including the optional choice of sides (Fries, Salad, Coleslaw).  They also have dessert! From what I remember, they had a S'mores pie, Coconut pie, Lime pie and some type of Streusel pie. It was tempting but I had to hold myself back this time.   I would of loved to see more seating inside but unfortunately it's a tight space. They have a few Muskoka chairs laying around outside to make up for the lack of seating inside but that's about it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It is located in the basement of a paint store on an obscure side road next to the Queensway. During my last visit, I ordered the butter chicken pie, mushroom pie and beef stew pie.  1) Butter Chicken - The filling was good and flavourful, however the chicken was a little dry 2) Mushroom - By far the best pie at the Pie Commission. Despite being a carnivore, this pie made me think twice. 3) Ground Beef - Good and standard pie  Key criteria of a good pie is the crust and it was not too soggy and had just the right amount of crisp to it."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. We just arrived from out of town and were looking forward to a fun dinner. After reading the reviews of Pie Commission, it sounded like the perfect place for us. I called ahead, and even though there was rush hour traffic we went anyway. I do wish the woman on the phone had mentioned that you can't see the restaurant from the street. We drove all over trying to park and find the place. That was frustrating (although this did not figure into the two stars)  The two stars are for the pie crust. I am a nut about pie crust and usually very picky, but this pie crust was delicious!  We ordered braised beef pie (good flavor but dry), steak and cheese (not as dry but strange Smokey flavor), peach and raspberry pie (just ok) and the peanut/chocolate custard pie, which, other than the peanuts on top, was not edible. I really should have taken it back.  It was not custardy at all -- it was very firm and not at all creamy, and not flavorful.   I was so hoping for a great pie experience but did not get one."}
{"text":"After following these guys on twitter, chatting with them via tweets about what pie I needed to have first, and then discovering that their storefront location is so close to me. I was more than a little excited to take my stellar friend/boss from Denver here for lunch yesterday (my first time as well).  It's a tiny hidden gem, on the back end of a Queensway plaza, so follow the advice of Stephanie S and turn off of Queensway onto Canmotor. By summer the staff told me that they'll have picnic benches set up outside but as of right now (and today's crazy snowy weather) there is a wrap around bench with about 4-6 spots.  Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, able to make strong reccos and ease my FOMO, advising me which pies I needed to have. The main recco was the braised beef, but when they mentioned they had a special Jerk Chicken pie, I jumped at the chance! The cashier warned me that she can never finish one because it's so spicy. I scoffed and thought typical big man thoughts like, I can handle spice, I've got hairs on my chest - muahh ha ha ha!!! That was stupid... so stupid.  The pie was unreal! The crust was incredible, easily the best 5 inch savoury pie I've ever eaten. But HOLY. SMOKE (and I mean SMOKE), that ISH was FU%^in HAWT!!! I tried to keep my chest puffed out like proud Manimal while i attacked it, but Jesus, I got 3/4 through and my brow was soaked, my mouth on fire and a tiny tear rolled down my cheek (thank goodness my boss didn't see - eek). Hot it might have been but the chicken inside was tender and the filling delicious!  I had the option of pairing my pie with fires or salad, I went with salad, freshly washed and still crisp it took the balsamic based dressing you add yourself perfectly.  Have to echo the comments of so many others, their unique packaging is what I really loved the most. The sliding drawer style takeaway package is unique and totally rad! I can't wait to come back and buy a bunch of their frozen pies to make at home. I'll be back soon!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"It's a bit hidden away, but once you find it, you will love it!  We ordered in ahead for a pick up order, everything was prepared on time (and fresh), everyone at the office was impressed and we will be adding this gem to our regular lunch rotation!  The pie itself was delicious, best savoury pie I've had ever (at a reasonable price)."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Sometimes I crave the dessert pies here and send someone out to pick one up. I think I'll eat just half of it, but it's impossible. I eat the whole thing! The fish or shrimp pies are so different than anything you can find anywhere else, it is one of the few places I'd consistently get takeout from in the hood."}
{"text":"The food was really great! Only thing that gets me a little bit wary of giving 5 stars is the balance between portions, combos, and menu pricing. It would've been nice to see a full combo of a small pie, salad and a canned pop for under 10, but instead it comes out to almost 14 dollars, so a meal for two would come out to 30 bucks. Hmmm...."}
{"text":"absolutely deliciousness!!  came here based on a recommendation from a friend and we really enjoyed ourselves.   it's a boutique location with that old Manhattan feel to it.   we had the butter chicken pie and the chicken bacon one. they were nice enough to split it up in half for us and package it in separately.  it was so flavourful and and the pastry was so fluffy, not greasy at all! totally enjoyed my visit here and i will return!"}
{"text":"Delicious Savoury Pies! Their golden, flaky, all-butter pastry is absolute perfection.   I stopped by this location last week to try the Veg-ilicous pie with kale, broccoli, cauliflower, millet and goat's cheese in a homemade tomato basil sauce. It was veg-heaven! Great flavours wrapped with butter pastry.   It was so good I bought 4 of their uncooked pies to take home with me and share the goodness! I ended up freezing them when I got home because I didn't know when I would be eating them. Last night I heated them up in the oven after thawing in the fridge overnight and they cooked perfectly following the instructions provided. I am so glad I took some home because it's a little far for me so I don't know when I will back. Everyone loved this pie as much as I did and commented on how great the pastry was.  I definitely consider this place a treat for me as they are a bit pricey, but one pie is filling enough. I love that every week they feature specialty pies, as well as their regular menu pies which I am sure are also to die for.  They had me at Pie and I will revisit in the future."}
{"text":"The pie was amazing. Don't have anything bad to say about the pie. My friend got fries and they were also good. The 2 bad thing was they were running out of pies and the pie was a little smaller than I thought it would be. But the pies are definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"Amazing crust, fantastic fries and interesting fillings on the savory pies.  For sure a great product.    However, I found the special steak and cheese pie a bit dry and detected no cheese flavor at all.  Amount of filling is a bit low for the amount of crust.  I also found that the pie and fries was too much for a meal (especially for a female).   I'd prefer the option of slightly smaller pies and a smaller serving of fries for a more reasonable price.  Or a two smaller pie option with side. People with bigger appetites could then try two pies. Kind of meal deals.  $13 bucks for a pie and fries with no drink and having to force yourself to eat the whole thing or thow out some of it just seems like poor planning.  Half the pie is not enough and the whole is too much.    Also the location had cute picnic tables and chairs outside and it was a gorgeous summery day but there was garbage and weeds all over the front area.  Take some pride and clean up your property!"}
{"text":"These pies are as good as it gets! If you're in the mood, don't hesitate to pull off the Gardiner, exiting at Islington and head down the first road north off the highway. The crust is flaky and awesome. The ingredients tasty and nicely salted. I had the Great Lakes / Beef pie which has caramelized onions and was rich and delicious.  This is a popular lunch spot in the area with lineups at their window in the summer, and room outside to eat. Bonus points for well thought out packaging which lets you grab your pie in a cardboard sleeve and eat it like a sandwich. They need to have the obligatory warning 'caution filling is hot' because even though we walked across a windy cold parking lot in front of the Cineplex theatre, the pie was still plenty hot after I toted it in one of their paper handle bags. The selection of sauces and condiments was intriguing and needs further investigating. Hooray for meat pies!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Their beef pies are their true winners here.  What's great about these is that you can buy them either ready or store them in your freezer for that night you know you'll be feeling lazy or in need of warm comfort food.  We had some cooked ones and they won us over.  Now, we have some in the freezer for the next lazy time."}
{"text":"My wife and I just split two pies for dinner: beef ribs and chicken bacon cheddar mash. For dessert, blueberry peach pie. These have ruined all other pies for me. Hands-down the best pies I've put in my mouth. It tastes so good when it touches your lips."}
{"text":"Best meat pie I've tried in Toronto thus far. Kanga pies is a crying shame compared to these. My favourite is the braised beef pie. It's like $13 but it's amazing! I can't wait to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"300th Review!!! This deserves a special touch. *clears throat*    Get a load of Pie Commission's meat pies,  They're really a treat, guys; Trust my word! Meat pies, veg pies, savory and sweet pies, Ordering with my eyes, \"Four to go.\"   Over here, man! Where's the sauce? Let's get another one, yeah?  Damn, that was some right quick service. Couldn't ask for better service.  What about seconds, please?   Ladies and gentlemen-- Let's  Eat!  And if you sang that in the tune of Sweeney Todd's \"God, That's Good,\" you'd be a pretty cool person in my book. Go back and try it. Seriously. It's pretty catchy.   Okay, maybe I got carried away, but I happen to like the pies here. Pretty jazzed as I've tried two other pie places in the last two weeks and Pie Commission is the only one I've not only been back to twice, but have been thinking about returning to again. I've sampled four kinds of savory pies and two kinds of sweet pies so far. The crusts are brilliant, flaky, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The fillings are always at least good, if not awesome (looking at you, beef rib).   The reason this isn't 5 stars? To be perfectly frank, it's the sweet pies. While the berry pie I tried was filled to the brim with blueberries and looked picture perfect, it desperately needed sugar. But the maple pecan pie I got was overly sweet and almost inedible. That was a pretty disappointing ending to my meal. The second time I came I skipped the sweet pies entirely; I was told that they switch up the sweet pies frequently, so perhaps I'll take my chances on dessert next time. And there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. I mean a savory pie PERIOD. I don't know why it's taken me 30 years to do so but I was beyond impressed.   I got the Chicken Cheddar Bacon Mash Pie and it was DELICIOUS! Perfect amount of mash and chicken (chunks of white meat I believe). I caught a few bacon pieces peeking through as I ate but can't say that the bacon, or cheese flavours shone through.   The pie crust... Oh goodness, the pie crust! It's to die for! Flaky and buttery. Doesn't get all wet and soppy. It reminds me of Jamaican COCKTAIL patties. No, not the regular big yellow ones but the ones you have to order ahead of time.  Sooooooo freaking good! I would take a side of pie crust if I could.  The fresh cut fries were a winner. I mean fresh is ALWAYS better in my opinion.   Apart from the food, The branding is amazing. Very clean and in your face.   If you haven't tried yet I suggest you do so... SOON!   I had a teensy taste of the Braised Beef Rib as well and that was good too. Tender beef and sweet potato? All good to me."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their pies. The best part is that you can buy them frozen and bake them at home - it smells and tastes just as good. The chicken mash and curry chicken are the best on the regular menu (oddly, I'm not a huge fan of the beer & beef pie). But it's the seasonal pies that I love the most - I haven't had a bad one yet. I think my favourites are anything with pulled pork."}
{"text":"Tried the pulled pork and braised beef. The braised beef was better in my opinion, the pulled pork had too much sauce (a little on the salty side). Coleslaw is not that great... Maybe because not a lot of people order it, but mine tasted like it was way overdue. French fries is definitely the better pick. Pies were good, very buttery and flaky :)"}
{"text":"The sign clearly marked \"Savory Pies\" as you walk down Dundas is nearly impossible to resist.  So my family and I had to stop in.  Reading the chalkboard menu, we all immediately saw flavor combinations we wanted to try, like steak and cheese or coconut curry beef.  The four of us ordered three different hot pies, which we devoured in the car headed to our next location. As quickly as the eating began, so did the sounds of delight!   My 15 year old said he couldn't believe how good his butter chicken pie was.  My 13 year old and I both raved over the steak and cheese, which had perfectly seasoned beef, cheese and a deliciously buttery flakey crust.  My husband had the coconut curry and was super pleased with it.    The next day, we were all still gushing over these pies!   So we decided to stop in and get 4 more hot and 4 unbaked for us to enjoy back home in Michigan, U.S.A.    We will stop here every time we're in Toronto, I'm sure of it.  Now if you could only deliver to Michigan, this would be a 5 star!"}
{"text":"The store is a bit hard to find but worth the scavenger hunt! :p  I had the vegetarian pie and it was fabulous! The pie was so flaky and filled with goodness. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the braised beef short rib pie with fries and a Tahiti treat combo. (Less than $12) Finally a really good meat pie.   The crust was amazing...so flaky and buttery.  The filling was delicious and they didn't skimp on the meat which was so tender.  The takeout box creates a perfect package to slide out your pie and side.  Such a busy place at lunch and seems like they sell out of flavours fast...so come early for lunch if possible.  The fries are really good and not greasy...goes well with the pie.  I washed it down with a Tahiti treat...I can't find that anywhere else!  The owner was talking about his pies and he seems really passionate about his food.  I will definitely come back and try the beef and beer, butter chicken and jerk chicken pie.  I could really see these guys opening up multiple locations...I want to buy a franchise and get a piece of the pie:)"}
{"text":"I tried two of the pies here and both were delicious. The first one we had was the chicken and bacon mash. Nice flaky and buttery crust and very flavourful pieces of chicken throughout a creamy mashed potato base. The bacon flavour wasn't too overpowering which was great too.  The beef rib pie was also really tasty. The beef pieces were super tender and nice bits of mushroom throughout also. Pastry was also fantastic.  We had initially wanted to try the chicken pot pie but that was sold out, but were not disappointed with what we had. We also got there pretty late and apparently the chicken pot pie sells out quite often, so will have to come back to give that a try.   Was a bit pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place a few weeks ago and went back again today.  We had lobster and shrimp pie the last time and today we had beef and beer pie. one word \"amazing\".  Now the whole office is hooked :) The best pie crust for sure."}
{"text":"After my mouth scorching encounter with the beef rib pie a few weeks ago, We happened to be in Etobicoke on a rainy Saturday and right near the Pie Commission and I was ready to have another go at their delicious pies.   I'm taking one star off for the fact that they have raised the price of the beef rib pie to a 50 cent premium. Come on, guys... you have a great thing going and I can't see how raising the price by 50 cents per pie is a kind thing at this point in the game. These guys are about to get BIG and make A LOT of money through franchising. I can see (and taste it).  Frankly, I'm not sure I love the beef rib pie the best. Not only because it's hot steamy inside burned my lip making it look like I had a cold sore for a week, but the sweet potatoes are just mushy and add no texture. It says that there are mushrooms in the pie, but I found none last time.  Anyway, back to this time:  My boyfriend had the Beef and Ale Pie for the second time and it was spot on. This is hands down, my favourite pie so far, I had the Chicken Bacon Cheddar Mash, which I had avoided ordering previously as I thought it would be too carby with the pastry and the potatoes on the inside. I was happily surprised to find that the filling was a wonderful creamy mixture of all good things. The chicken was tender and delicious, enveloped by soft mashed potatoes, just a smoky hint of bacon and pockets of cheddar. This is what a chicken pie should be! This in now my second favourite pie!  They really have the delicious buttery pastry cornered. I see a Queen St West location within the next year. One good thing about Etobicoke is that the hipsters haven't discovered this place yet. But it's coming...."}
{"text":"Still consistently fabulous and now expanding!!! This little Etobicoke spot became an addiction when it first opened and we have been loyal customers ever since.  The nice thing about the Staff and management is that they are still just as super friendly, professional AND have ensured the quality hasn't done anything but improve even as they set to open downtown.  The only complaint I have is that in spite of being SUPER loyal, it's the downtown crowd that will be able to go in, sit and dine in while having an adult beverage!!!! WHAAAAAAAT??????? That hardly seems fair!!!!! Well done gang!!!! Good luck downtown and keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Bought a couple of pies hot to go...one chicken, one beef. Crust nice and flaky, filling tasty. This place isn't cheap but the pies are good. One thing I thought was strange was I bought 4 pies, uncooked, to take home and bake later. When I got them home I realized there were no baking instructions. We winged it with no issues, just thought it was strange that they didnt include baking instructions."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try me some savoury pie goodness! Unfortunately it took me a while to actually find the place, didn't realize it was tucked behind a corner at first (the address says it's technically on the Queensway but it's just behind it), but once I figured it out I was quite impressed with the selection. I'm a bit picky as I don't eat lamb or mushrooms (very common ingredients in savoury pies), but I was able to find multiple pies to choose from that suited my tastes. Yay! I got 4 pies to go, and I love that they have a \"pre-thawed\" option for when you want to bake it yourself later that day. Convenient! The baking instructions were simple and the pies were delicious. I tried a special pie (brisket and cheese) and it was so delicious (love that they put the flaky crust all over, not just on the top). Great place to pick up a delicious, easy meal for a night in!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Best suited for take-out as there is not a lot of sitting room.  The food is very tasty - and let's be honest, it is a fairy innovative concept; how many other places are selling delicious, ready to take home, pies of all kinds of varieties?   A little hard to find so be patient and don't give up too easily - it took me about 5 mins of walking around in circles to find it, but when I did I was sure glad I did."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pies however I did find them abit pricey for the size, the crust was awesome though. The line up for this place was abit strange to me for a meat pie.   I did buy a couple of them to bring home and try, they were ok , I might go back in a pinch if I needed a quick dinner."}
{"text":"$10 for a pie might seem like a lot, but wait until you eat one (let alone try to make one!). This is perfectly hot, flavourful, with a flakey crust. There is science and love in these pies that is not replicable for $10 in your own kitchen, let's face it!  We ate the butter chicken, and a prime rib ones. It was like a warm hug on a cold day. Except it was summer, and we were just starving."}
{"text":"Had the veg-ilicous pie not bad and fries with chipotle lime mayo delicious...   My buddy had the pulled pork and beef n beer,  he like the pull parked alot...  We didn't like the coleslaw too much lacked mayo and something else was a bit too sweet..   Staff was friendly and happy to serve...   Atmosphere, cute hipster style with charm, good teeny rock music   Would I come back? Yes if it was closer to where I lived.  Would I recommend/endorse it? Yeah   Why four star? Just didn't feel like a 5* place"}
{"text":"Great meat pies. Everything on the 'Specials' board was hot and ready to go, along with a smaller selection from the regular menu. Terrific for a quick meal on the go."}
{"text":"Considering this place has dozens of reviews, I'll keep it short. The pie crust is about the best I've and made with real butter. I had a special which had beef brisket, cheese and glazed onions. I don't want to overstate it, but the beef was incredible - along with everything else. Both people I brought with me were beyond impressed. It's 'close your eyes when eating' good. The side of fries is just over $3 and they're fresh-cut fries at a generous portion - enough to share between the 3 of us.  Only downside is knowing one pie is more than enough if you're remotely conscious of your health. I almost left sad knowing I'd have to wait to try the chicken/mango/curry, along with the sweet pies."}
{"text":"By far the FLAKIEST and I mean flakes-stuck-all-around-your-lips-as-well-as-all-over-your-lap level of flakiness pie that I've EVER had. The crust is so deliciously buttery, yet you can eat an entire pie by yourself without feeling guilt or too greasy because it's so light and flaky.   Although located rather unfortunately far for me, I have no regrets having traveled all the way here to try this place out. I tried the braised beef rib pie and my boyfriend tried the coconut curry beef pie. Both were generously filled with soft, tender meat and marinated in delicious sauce. The fries were mediocre (would not order again) but I would definitely come back for their pies if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Mmmm pie!! The savory kind :) the pastry is soo good with layers of buttery flavor! I bought the butter chicken pie with a side of fries! Hate the fries cause it's soft... But a British coworker said it's just like home!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place based on reviews and now I am a true believer of reviews and a dedicated reviewer for YELP.  I ordered a baked steak and cheese pie for myself and purchased 4 unbaked (2 braised, 1 butter chicken and a steak and cheese) for my cousins family to try it out. The service was quick which I loved.   I came straight home and had my pie...now i'm not so sure if i want to share the rest lol....the pie itself is just so flaky and buttery, best pie i've ever had to be honest. I'm not a fan of coleslaw so the coleslaw was okay to me, next time I will probably have it with fries.   Had a bit of trouble finding the place since it was my first time and they only have outdoor seating so it will definitely not be a winter spot."}
{"text":"I have not actually been to the physical location but my dad always buys pies from this place. He has described it as sort of a hole in the wall set up but I will go and see for myself.  So the review is only for the food:  Basically he buys four pies at a time. The types are unique and delicious. butter chicken pot pie! does that qualify as fusion? chicken/mash pie is great. the crust on the pies is flaky and savoury. I wish to try a fresh pie from them, so far we bake it at home (reheat?)  Absolutely amazing. I like. Will visit soon."}
{"text":"This is a must try! Its oh so familiar but still unique! Super delicious, flavourful and affordable!   The place is small but clean &organized. Not much dining space but the have considerable picnic-style seating outdoors. We were having a party however and opted to get pies to go. Also the staff were all very friendly and helpful, no complaints with the service!   For takeout, the pies come in this really cool box containing a pie and a side! They had salad, fries, and coleslaw. Unfortunately we left them in the box for too long and the fries were kind of soggy so I can't do much of a review on that. But the salad was fancyyy. Wasn't just your basic lettuce and tomato. It also had kale, spinach and carrots in it. The salad dressing was a bit weird though. It was really thick and garlicy, more akin to a dip.   THE PIES. We had quite a few people at our party so we pretty much got every flavor there at the time. Braised beef, beef n beer, butter chicken, pulled pork, shepherds pie. And I think i'm missing one more. But anywho, the fillings were all great. Flavourful but probably on the more bland side just because they needed to be less liquid for the pie. The pie CRUST however made up for this. This has got to be one of the, if not the BEST PIE CRUSTS I've ever had. So flaky and buttery. This same deliciousness translated so well when we got to dessert time. Aside front he savoury pies we also got 3 dessert pies. Pumpkin, coconut, and a blueberry mango. While they're all so so good, my favorite has to be the blueberry mango. Very rich in flavour, the granola at the top also gave it an extra delicious dimension, and I personally really like a bit of tanginess.   So was it worth it? YES. The pies might look small but they're actually very filling, I could barely finish my side! So for about $10 I don't think I could ask for more. I believe they also have seasonal flavours so I definitely look forward to trying out some new pies!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, flaky goodness!  Adorable spot dedicated to pies! Very nice addition to the neighborhood. The restaurant has a bit of a kitschy feel with the checkered floors (not my favorite look but it's totally fitting with the theme of the resto). Diners get to choose from the many savory and sweet pies. If you don't feel like dining in, there's always the option of take-out or purchasing a frozen pie.   *The Butter Chicken-chickpea & Vegalicious pies are my two favorites!   Diners can buy individual pies or include sides of coleslaw and fries. Portions are veeery reasonable for the price.   This place is a must visit for all pie enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"The best coconut pie bar none!!  Amazing flakey pastry and the creamiest coconut filling.  Perfect."}
{"text":"This was my favorite meat pie place until tonight. The buttery crust is flaky and delicious as always however, the filling was extremely disappointing. I ordered the butter chicken and there was absolutely no chicken in the filling. Not sure what happened here. But will now try to find a new favorite pie place. Fries are also hit and miss. Sometimes they are fantastic and other time soggy."}
{"text":"935 the Queensway yes - but come around the block from Canmotor and the backend of the building via Queen Elizabeth to park and access the storefront from there and park there too.  That is probably the only thing that will fool those who are directionally challenged.    This is not a proper place to really eat as the counter is tiny and there's just stool seats inside (3) while the outside does have some places to sit down I'd imagine as the weather gets worse you may not want to eat out there.  The parking is right in front but also off to the side as well being that this storefront does not face Queensway.  The area in front of the storefront doesn't appear to be paved and could become muddy if it gets wet.    The food is something a little different.  I love pies and yet I'm not a dessert person so go figure.  While they have pies hot for the ready to eat savory as well as sweet ones on display their other offering is take home frozen pies which run roughly 7.50 a piece.  A 4 pack box will cost about 30 bucks give or take as their seems to be a surcharge for braised beef pies of 50 cents more.  These products are great and the pies are 7.50 for a reason and if I had to answer that it's because you can create a market for people willing to pay 7.50 for 5\" pot pies because they taste oh so good.  These are NOT Swanson frozen pies these are much better and are completely in a different league.  The crust is light and flaky and the insides or oh so tasty.    We came rather late and much had been sold out but we did manage to get 2 braised beef and one seasonal one with pork and squash.  I had ordered 2 each of braised beef and beef and beer frozen to take home.  The cards there have the baking instructions and it doesn't seem that hard to make.  For a really good frozen why not try these instead of your typical grocery store preservative ridden frozen food?  Yes they take a long to make but it's worth it.  The baking of the crust is not something that you can compromise by trying to microwave it.  It would be the difference of trying to boil something that is intended to be fried... just not the same.  If I could wish something I would wish 2 things actually.  One would be that they have a way of actually identifying what pies are what when you order them whether it be take out hot and ready or take home.  The pies all look the same so we couldn't tell them apart.  For the frozen ones that's another issue since there is no breaking them apart because they are frozen solid.  A way to tell what is what would help.  Another wish list item would be for the frozen pies to be sealed or bagged.  I don't mind doing it myself but it's not like we can just take the box and throw it in the freezer like that exposed.    Besides those wish list items the food here is fantastic and I look forward to cooking a few at home on a day that it doesn't look favorable to go outside - this is probably as close to perfect comfort food that's not chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing find. The smell of the pies when you walk in will make you weak in the knees it's so good. The pie crusts are light and flakey. They don't short you on filling. Had the butter chicken pie and it was heavenly. My husband had the braised beef and he said it was very good. I enjoyed my bite but not something I'd order for myself. Had the chocolate chip oatmeal cookie for dessert, was very good.  Also grabbed the lemon tart pie. It was alright. Wouldn't get it again though.  Don't come expecting to eat in the Resturant. There's no inside seating and space outside is limited. We will definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye, like a little piece of pie, that's amore!  I love savoury pies... I grew up on those frozen chicken pot pies as a kid, and have clamored for freshly made ones for a long while now.  I just happen to be in the neighbourhood and spotted this place and made an impromptu visit.  The pies were delish, and need to come back to sample more.  They're definitely not the 99 cent frozen ones I had as a kid (for the better) but they are a little pricey, however that won't be stopping me from coming back, though I may not come here as often as I'd like.  If this was priced in the snack-ish range, I'd be here daily."}
{"text":"This place is for hardcore pie lovers. It is a very focused set up. Very little to distract you from anything else except pie.   Lets talk science here people. Pie is all about ratios. The most important is the crust to filling ratio. And by having hand sized pies, you are increasing the crust to filling ratio, compared to conventional sized pies. (Smaller circles have greater surface area to mass ratio than larger ones... Remember from high school science?) science is delicious!  Speaking of crust... The sausage roll is nearly half crust! I ate 6 of them on my first visit... As an appetizer.... Before i ate 6 more.... I have a pie addiction.   And butter. The damn thing is gloriously buttery.  Thank you pie commision for providing the human race a way to stuff our faces with as much buttery crust in the most efficient way possible, and at a reasonable price. This is as close as I will be to my dream of having a restaurant that serves just beautiful buttery crust."}
{"text":"High quality, unique flavors. Excellent food items. Take out is best/ Only downside is the poor parking access which is NOT related to the food."}
{"text":"Good pies, heavy, but kind of satisfying at the same time.   The takeout pouch, which has a flap and made of cardboard is extremely well designed and made eating the pie on the go a dream.  If you are looking for an adventure, get a pie here, put it in your murse, or purse, whatever you store your keys and stuff in, and trek to the theater across the street. Remember, keep a straight face and if someone can smell your pie, pretend it was your natural smell, or a fart. Beware, you will make the whole theater jealous because all they can eat is popcorn and candy and nachos.   BONUS: having tried all the pies now, I'd say my favourite ones are the beef ribs, minced beef, and vegetarian."}
{"text":"Yum. Flaky, buttery, savoury. I really enjoyed our quick dinner here.   There's 5 main flavours to choose from, seems like the Braised Beef is the most popular and was sold out by the time we got there at 6pm on Wednesday.  The Veggie and the Chicken & Cheddar looked amazing. But we opted for one of the 5 other seasonal pies - Beef Brisket.   Each was about $7-8. You can get with side dishes like fries, salad or coleslaw for an additional dollar. We shared a pie, got a full sized salad and side of fries and was enough for the 2 of us.   The Beef Brisket was super yummy. I would go there again to try the other types. We also took home a TripleBerry pie for dessert. Very good too.   There are 3 seats here, at a bar area, and only fits really 2 people. I would recommend taking it to go (comes in an efficiently packed box), or on a nice day probably can eat in front of the store.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time finally.  I kept passing it--its not the easiest place to locate first time around.  There is no storefront on Queensway it is on Queen Elizabeth Blvd.  This place is definitely worth seeking out.  The only beef pies they had available when i was there was the braised rib and beef n' beer.  I took two to go and reheated them at home.  My intent was to just eat half for dinner and save the latter for lunch the next day--but the beef n' beer pie so savory and toothsome I couldn't stop eating it.  The pie wasn't overly greasy and the seasonings used didn't overpower the natural flavor of the beef.  The pastry was spot on--flaky and not too heavy.    The only item I would add to the filling would be a bit more black pepper.  The price for two pies came to $16.00 but as an occasional meal I think its worth it.   I will definitely return to try some of their other pies and fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Hella Good Pie.  When that Steak & Cheese comes up on the menu, do NOT miss it.  If you think \"I don't really like pie\" it's probably because you haven't had the right pie. I don't really like pie myself, yet I find myself so darn excited to pick out which one we'll try that night, and drooling myself into a food coma an hour later.  There's fresh and frozen and there's no reason not to get two... each... and then more."}
{"text":"LOVE! Randomly discovered this joint and I have no regrets. Delicious creations put into a tasty pie crust. They cater to many different people whether it be by culture, food preferences, or cravings. Vegetarian pie never sounded so tasty! (Coming from a non-vegetarian). They also have pies you can take home and heat up yourself. If I lived in the area, I would have a fridge full of these babies. YUM!"}
{"text":"OMG every time I am in town I roll by to try yet another pie-of-the-day and wait to be disappointed. It never happens. The curry-chickpea-leek-kale pie I had yesterday was pure inspiration, especially with alternating dips in the banana ketchup and HP. Also have fond memories of the butter chicken and beef tips pies. Seriously, if I lived here I would have a shelf in the freezer dedicated to their pies.   Bonus points for Freewheelin' Bob Dylan on the stereo. Don't think twice, it's the pies."}
{"text":"Entered into Bellwoods only to find most places closed.  Walked by The Pie Commission and ventured in.   First thing that caught my eye butter chicken pie. So that's what we ordered. Not cheap for the size. 7.95 add a side 2.90 total of 10.85 before tax! We also ordered their poutine 6.95.   So let's talk pie. AMAZING! The pastry crust cooked though no soggy bottom and yet not burnt.  The butter chicken filling just enough heat that it doesn't overwhelm the buttery pastry.  For sides you have a choice (should you decide to pony up the 2.90) of hand cut fries, garden salad or coleslaw. We got sucked in and paid for the slaw.  The fresh slaw that was not too sour or salty was a good pair to the heat of the butter chicken.  The poutine was pretty average, nothing too special. One comment on that was their gravy wasn't over salty and didn't make you want to keep drinking while eating it.   Would I come back? Maybe if I felt like splurging on a really good small pie."}
{"text":"Fresh buttery and flaky pies with a wide variety of fillings both sweet and savoury. Hidden gem tucked away beneath a hair salon.   Food is incredibly fresh (or can get frozen for later if you prefer!) generous sides of salad or fries and super yummy gravy. Definitely try the house made pork and rosemary sausage rolls and the butter chicken pie, two of my faves!  Lots of sweet pies for dessert too! :)   Staff is amazing and friendly and I look forward to going again soon!"}
{"text":"Been a customer since day one. Almost 4 years. Went today took home a 4 pack special taco and cheese X2, steak and Cheese and beef and beer. A lemon mirangue desert pie. Always friendly service. They know my name. Lol. Great place"}
{"text":"I miss living across the street from this hidden gem.  Good polite service, but very busy because of how good this place is.   Beef and beer pie and butter chicken pie with damn good real fresh cut fries(not fake McCain fries). They have a good hot dipping sauce.   It's been months since I had one of those two pies and fries. But I will definitely have to make a trip down there again."}
{"text":"Etobicoke has very little in the way of redeeming qualities; after all it is the land that brought us Rob Ford. BUT in the back of a strip plaza off Queensway lies a little pie shop, making savoury pies so delicious that they are penance enough for all of  Etobicoke's sins. For the love of all that is holy get yourself to this god-forsaken land to try these pies, it will be worth your while, I promise.   Being in the area I decided to pop-in for lunch. The place is so hidden that I drove right by it, even with my GPS, so keep your eyes peeled for a small sign pointing you to the back of a plaza. The place is a hole in the wall with only three stools to sit and eat and some picnic tables outside. They serve a vast array of savoury pies, on this day I was feeling a little more conventional so I opted for the beer and beef pie with a side salad ($10 all in). Within one bite this became the best pie my lips have ever had the pleasure of tasting (savoury or otherwise). Crust so flaky and butter filled it will take years off your life, beef filling so flavourful, craft beer infused veal stock so rich without being too heavy, all in all the perfect lunch. Side salad was uninspired and probably came out of a box but with pies this good who cares? Despite the amazing buttery dough and meaty filling I did not feel gross or heavy afterwards, it was the perfect lunch portion.    They sell pies fresh or frozen so if you want to pick up and take home some pies for another day that is an option. Their menu consists of an eclectic group of pies ranging from pulled pork, butter chicken, all the way south for a jerk chicken pie. They do have a couple of sweet options too but these guys are keeping things savoury for the most part.   In short don't walk to Etobicoke, RUN! And don't forget to bring me a pie ;-)"}
{"text":"\"Overall, not many seats outside (and none inside as we soon discovered), but dining-in did not appear to be the focal point for Pie Commission.\" \"A loud \"Bloody Good Pies\" sign welcomed us along with a plenty of black and white signage and an illustration of a moustached gentleman with a bowl hat. \" \"Our Beef'n'Beer pie was heavy, meaty and a bit on the dry side. We saw the chunks of onion through the homogeneous content of the filling. We preferred the meat option due to a more flavorful taste, the veggie one could have used a bit more of a flavour spike.\" \"All dessert pies were sold cold including the Strawberry, Rhubarb Apple Crumble we bought. It came sprinkled with oats and crumbs - so be careful not to let them get away.\"  Just a few bites of our experience.."}
{"text":"It took us a long time to finally get around to coming here.  This location is a bit tucked away off the main thoroughfare that is the Queensway, so unless you're looking for it, you could miss it easily, but it's really not hard to find (one block south, and one block east of Queensway and Islington).  I now wish we had not dragged our silly little feet for so long, these pies are worth all the hype.  The crust on these things alone makes me love them, very buttery and flakey.  But then you get into the ample fillings and they are all incredible, never too dry or too wet (a failing of many other meat pies), and seasoned well.  Those dessert pies, though - OMG.  Why isn't everyone just talking about those!  We got a couple to split the first time we were there, thinking they'd be great to just round out the meal.  The second time we were there, that's all we purchased!  One very important note to the proprietors and new customers, if you do buy any of the dessert pies with toppings on them, DO NOT put them into the standard pie boxes, they aren't high enough, and all the filling sticks to the top of the box (we learned this the hard way, and after about an hour on the floor bawling in existential crisis, contemplating the nihilistic nature of the universe, we vowed never to let that happen again).  Also, have longer hours!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in high-rotation for any pies (meat or savoury) that my family or I purchase. Absolutely a treat for a last minute dinner, affordable, and tasty. I highly recommend. plus their takeout boxes make it a great office birthday, etc. type of treat!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness!!! The crust is something , so buttery and flakey, these pies are more on the drier side in terms of filling and I like it!  I have tried other similar pie places in the city but so far the taste here is the best. Totally worth the calories. Better than pot pies I had in London England."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to realized The Pie Commission was a purveyor of savory pies, kind of like pot pies but with a gourmet twist.   Kris U took me here for an afternoon lunch and while we did sit inside and eat there we wouldn't have been able to do so if anyone else had been in the place because there were only about 3 stools at a counter. They do an awesome to-go business where you can even buy the pies in bulk and that definitely seems to be the focus.  I chose the Chicken Cheddar Bacon Mash pie which had roasted garlic cheesy bacon mashed potatoes stuff inside a beautifully flaky pastry shell. It was quite filling and came in an adorable little brown box. I was also able to get a simple green salad on the side.  It's easy to see why the place is so popular - the food is fast and delicious and with an interesting take on an old comfort food item."}
{"text":"I NEED ONE CLOSER TO ME. I always take home 4 frozen pies cause I crave these constantly. Forget that Swanson frozen crap you get in the grocery store. You get quality goodness with these pies. the pastry is amazeballd and the fillings they have are unique. The dundas location is much larger than the Mississauga one. Id prefer to go to this one as Porchetta is just a couple doors down heheh. Im a pig."}
{"text":"Best meat pies ever!!!! I come here every time I'm in Toronto for work. The shop is a bit hidden but once you enter the smell of freshly baked pies will make your tummy rumble in hunger!   The girls at the front were super friendly and the service was quick. They sell frozen and freshly baked pies. The pies are flaky and filled with amazing fillings. They have regular pies and a selection of seasonal pies but my favourite is the braised beef! A pre baked pie cost about $9 and you can add a side (fries, salad, coleslaw) for $3.  Four frozen pies are $26.   Ohhhhhhh and you can't leave without trying one of there desert pies. The apple cheesecake pie is amazing."}
{"text":"It was ok.  My bf who loves meat pies thought it was great.  He would go back.  The french fries are good.  The pies are small but then again, you do pay for the \"made from scratch\" and baked fresh daily.  The packaging was really nice.  The place is small, there were only 3 bar stools.  This place is more of a pick up and take out type of place.  There are some seats outside.  It was quite busy when we went at 1:30pm.  There were about 5 other people in the line up ahead of us.  We were lucky to get a table and while we were eating there, there was always a line up.  One customer mentioned that he goes there every single saturday."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Delicious pies. I've tried two of their savoury pies (pulled pork, and braised beef), and one sweet pie. The pulled pork was delicious. The braised beef became an obsession."}
{"text":"Damn, a day late from actually posting this on Pie Day (March 14 aka 3.14).  I'm a huge fan of the Pie Commission. Admittedly this was my first time ordering from the Queensway location and we did so via Door Dash for delivery.  This excerpt from my review of the Dundas St location pretty much sums it up: \"Straight up, these were some tasty pies. The crusts were flakey yet fluffy, and even the left overs re-heated well.\"  Every pie of the 5 different ones I've tried now have been quite tasty. The only thing I will say is that I'm not a huge fan of their sides. But really, the goal here is to keep your eyes on the pies. That's what you're really coming here for anyways."}
{"text":"Straight up, these were some tasty pies. We grabbed a few to dine on including:  -Butter Chicken (best of them, very unique but seemed like there was actually a bit of a Tandoori spice flavour happening in it. The added chickpea and what might be diced cauliflower added extra texture and flavour which helped make this the best) -Chicken Cheddar Bacon Mash (hearty comfort food, most traditional of the bunch) -Pulled Pork (a decent pulled pork flavour, but felt a little like it was missing something and was a bit one dimensional versus the other pies. Perhaps would've been best with some coleslaw added)  The crusts were flakey yet fluffy, and even the left overs re-heated well.  These might just be the best meat pies in the city, however pound for pound on the value to satisfaction ratio, I'm sticking to 4 stars as there are still better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I finally tried the pies here. I ordered the Steak and Cheese with fries and added coleslaw as an additional side (as I love coleslaw). I have to admit, it was pretty disappointing. My fries were WAY too salty and my pie felt contaminated by the salt because it also was very salty (I wish I ordered a drink so that I could sort of even the meal). The coleslaw was nothing special. I wish it was creamier and it felt like it was a little washed up. For such a great job on the packaging, I thought I was going to have my mind blown by these pies. Maybe the butter chicken (which was my second choice) would have been better. I think I will give it another shot but so far, I haven't been impressed."}
{"text":"These pies are heavenly good. The Pie Commission's location is perfect and close to many other great bars and restaurants. Plus they have a pretty phenomenal instagram. I got the chicken curry pie and it was worth coming all the way to Canada."}
{"text":"Ive been here in the pouring rain, hot summer days and cold freezing days... all ends well with a nice hot pie. I've turned my whole family to the pies from here.   My brother stocks up the frozen ones for his late night nibbles.  The braised beef is flavorful and the beef is tender. The butter chicken is one of his favorite. The chicken cheddar bacon mash is delicious and has chucks of bacon in it. I've had their steak and cheese plus a bunch of their dessert pies.  The insides are all good but lets get down to the main attraction: the crust. Flakey, light, buttery, and doesn't get soggy. The frozen ones you bake at home comes out just as flakey and delicious.   Their smores dessert pie is great, I just ask them to pop it in the oven quickly and the marshmallows are melting on top :) They have another location in toronto's west end."}
{"text":"Love this business. The pies are so good keeping it tastey. Be aware of the Jerk pot pie.... I like spicy, but had it just now and sadly couldn't eat it. Just too much heat. they must be using really fresh hot peppers. Just for me too hot. But all the others were so good! Well done."}
{"text":"Yup. This hits the spot. I admit only been here once but the pies are amazing. Got their signature beef pie and wow, incredibly awesome.  Extremely heavy as I assume all pies are.  It looks small but I guess it just expands right up.  comes in a cardboard container for easy busy eatting.  Be aware this is takeout place with little seating.  There are ledges to sit on outside tho"}
{"text":"With all the positive reviews I decided to give The Pie Commission a try. My friend lives in the area and also gave it a favourable review.  I tried  the Braised Beef pie.  When it comes to flavour my first bite told me this is not your typical 'beef' pie. Think 'pumpkin spice loaf' and not 'beef and ale'. It may not be to some peoples taste but, it's Fall, and I found it appropriate for the season. Personally I didn't think there was enough filling in proportion to crust. Also didn't see much beef, only a few slivers.  The best part of the pie was the crust. Flakey, rich and just about damn perfect.  3/5  For dessert I tried the Triple Berry Crumble pie. There was just the right amount of sweetness. On the negative side I found the filling to be sparse and with way too much crumble on top, part of which tasted slightly underdone.  1/5  Friendly and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, the best pie I've ever tasted. I had the taco rice one at a beerfestival and I was hooked. The crust is the BEST PART, and I usually don't eat it since it's too much dough but this one's super buttery and flakey like you've never had like.. EVER."}
{"text":"It was decent although the girl that took the orders for my step-dad and I didn't understand us and it was annoying in all honesty. I think she might have been new or something but my step-dad isn't a quiet talker, he's always borderline shouting so I don't get how she didn't understand his good loud English so there is no excuse for saying our order wrong. I would go back though."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical paying over $10 for a single pie but ended up loving the Pie Commission.  I tried the rib pie and steak cheese pie. Both were amazing and filling.  I personally preferred steak and cheese.  Unfortunately for the price I can't eat here often but will be going back one day."}
{"text":"I WILL be back. I bought a few pies today! Braised Beef Rib (my favourite), butter chicken, banana chocolate with marshmallow whip and coconut. The flakiness, buttery-est crust. So very good. This just might be Etobicoke'a finest secret."}
{"text":"Best pies I've ever had. Great quality and awesome service. Recommend this place to everyone. Try their savoury pies they're unreal"}
{"text":"There are literally no words for this place, I tried it when it first opened and it was literally the best thing I've had in a while. There is nothing ordinary about their pies. As they say in their motto bloody good pies! Dessert pies, savoury pies, and even cookies! Bless their little hearts for this hidden gem of a place."}
{"text":"I am Australian so have some idea when it comes to pies. They definitely get the pastry right, not too flakey not too heavy, kudos. My big issue with this place is the menu, too many weird pies and missing staples. Just want a regular meat pie or a steak and kidney but instead they have butter chicken or seafood or some other concoction.   Also, where's the sweet BBQ sauce, all they have is north American Smokey BBQ sauce which just does not work. Would give my left teste for fountain BBQ sauce.   Worth a try but a little too fancy pants rather than just good pies."}
{"text":"not bad.. lot of HYPE, but overall wasn't cheap and food quality was DECENT.  Nice unique spot, friendly staff.."}
{"text":"OMG the steak and cheese pie is AMAZING!!! This needs to be an all year round pie!!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and decided to try it.  I love meat pies and was impressed with not only the variety but also their use of only natural ingredients.  I ordered 4 different kinds--a German (with chopped bratwurst and onion) a Mexican (chicken, corn, chipotle, tomato), a butter chicken, and braised beef.  The first 2 were specials so not available all the time.  I took them to go, and they came in a pizza box with directions for baking them in the oven. We only ate two, saving the rest for later.  Very tasty and fresh!  Really enjoyed them, and will be back for more.  If you like meat pies or are looking for something different try this place, it's excellent.  Note that this place is not really a restaurant in that you can't eat there except in summer when you can sit outside.  It's designed for you to take out and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before they renovated so that patrons could actually get inside the building and order. It used to be just through a window on the wall where transactions occurred. And when the pies used to be two times the size they are now. This was 2-3 years ago. They weren't even discreet about reducing the size of their pies. It's not just a little smaller; it's a LOT smaller. See, if they made them cheaper that would've been justified. But it was still around the same price as before.  I felt cheated to be honest. Not going back."}
{"text":"I am going to have re-evaluate this whole pie battle in the GTA. Maybe I will keep this one as a west-end exclusive as it is in Etobicoke and we all know that's technically not Toronto. Anyhow, as I always like to re-iterate.... the West has the best!  Throw out all your thoughts of Kanga, forget about Wisey's because this is it; the holy grail of pies (for now). I was once gullible enough to believe Kanga was king of pies but now I know.... I know not pies!  The aroma of this place seduces you as you enter, you are indeed in butter heaven. The anticipation builds up and hurts a little as you patiently wait for it even though the wait is short. Yes, it is better than it smells and it's all yours.  Each pie is served with a piping hot filling, wrapped in a super flaky, buttery crust. The crust to filling ratio is almost perfect here. Super crispy on the outside and warm gooey goodness on the inside. Each pie is flavourful and distinct in their own way and you get the same amazing crust.  This place is the gold standard by which all savoury pies will be compared to in this town. Actually, I think they have a second location somewhere on King St."}
{"text":"The savory pies were delicious. The braised beef one was great and the butter chicken one was decent, but didn't think it was as good as the beef as the flavour seemed less intense. Did not like the dessert coconut  pie though - very dry."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of these pies. The flakey crust, creative fillings - you just can't go wrong. The regular menu is solid  (try the braised beef yum!) and their specials have never disappointed me. Today I dug into a meatball pie and a pulled pork pie, followed by a taste of rhubarb pie and a lemon one. I love that you can get savoury or sweet. I always order fresh and frozen so I can get immediate satisfaction and later on when I'm too lazy to cook dinner. The only real downside to this shop is you can't really eat there - but then again, I don't think it was meant to be that way, so it doesn't really bother me."}
{"text":"Pie was amazing! Most definitely the best pie i have ever ate, the coleslaw however was not that great. Also the serving was not that filling for me but the quality was out of this world! Next time i will need to get two pies. I ordered the braised beef."}
{"text":"Came in here to check out pies but we weren't greeted.  We checked out the pies and never saw anyone.  I didn't hear anyone cleaning in the back and if we'd have been acknowledged that would have been different.  Even if you're busy, just acknowledge customers.  Needless to say, we didn't stick around to buy anything.    Revise this review if someone is there next time."}
{"text":"The pies here are always perfect. Tasty, flakey, juicy. There is no seating area unless you want to eat outside. It's more of a pick up and eat at home place. I haven't tried the frozen pies yet but I'm always impressed with the fresh ones. And they sell hot sauce!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem, but with no shortage of customers walking in as we were eating our pies. Lived up to my expectations for sure!   We ordered the the braised short rib pie, lobster and shrimp pie (seasonal), and chocolate Nutella banana custard pie.   The braised short rib was amazing! It was flavorful and the pie itself was flakey and melt in your mouth. I didn't like the lobster and shrimp as much. There was little to no taste. I liked the filling of the chocolate Nutella banana custard pie, but didn't like the pie crust as much because it was harder. I was expecting a crust as fluffy as the savory pie.   Will definitely go back to try the BBQ beef pie and get frozen pies to make at home!   Take out is advised as there's only 3 stools to sit on and the restaurant is very small."}
{"text":"A little hard to find at first. It's tucked away one street south of Queensway, east of Islington. About 5 parking spots out front, and street parking - I dont really see this being an issue. People either come for a quick bite or get a bunch of goods to go anyways. If it's nice out, there are a few high tables, muskoka chairs, and picnic tables to enjoy it fresh. But otherwise, you gotta take it to go - not an eat-in establishment.  I came here Saturday morning, opened the doors, and this heavenly buttery waft just hit me in my face. I knew I made the right decision by coming here right after sweating my ass off at hot yoga to negate my workout. haha. Since it was my first time, I ordered their classic braised beef pie. Drizzled some sriracha on that bad boy and wolf'd it down. It was light, flakey, crisp on the outside, and warm, hearty beef on the inside. Had to convince myself to leave and not order another pie to save it for another time.   However, I did buy one of their peanut butter jelly dessert pies to go. It was dense. Massive peanut butter cookie top over some jelly filling. Pie crust and pb cookie was good....but the jelly filling was too sweet. I cut the pie up into 4 pieces and will slowly eat it over the next few days because it's just too sweet. BUT, that will not deter me from giving the other dessert pies a try.  Overall, I see myself doing more hot yoga, thus, resulting in more pie consumption. LOL"}
{"text":"This is a walk in restaurant where most people take out. There is very limited, again, very limited areas to eat there (unless it's summer and you eat outside).  We've tried different savoury pies and all of them have been soooooo good!  The price is reasonable. The service, just don't expect much, and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"I love this place and the fact that they change their offerings frequently. The crust is incredible fresh or even frozen. I just wish they had a license so you could enjoy your pie on the patio with a nice pint! My only criticism is that it is a tad expensive. Otherwise it compares to some of the finest pie houses in the UK."}
{"text":"Great flaky and yummy pies! Their portions are pretty decent, wide variety of filling options. Definitely worth the visit for something you don't get to have everyday."}
{"text":"Hmmm pies. They have a bit of everything to satisfy your savory and or sweet cravings. The pies are fortunately larger than I thought.  The pulled pork was super good. Pork was nice and tender, while the BBQ sauce was not too sweet. This is definitely a pay for your food and go, not a dine-in. They also have short hours, so always look it up beforehand!"}
{"text":"It is a bit hard to see inside with the old house sort of entryway, but if you brave it up the few steps, you will be pleased.  There was no one here when I came for lunch with colleagues, and I was wary at first. However, after the friendly service at the counter, and the almost instantaneous presentation of my pie, I was sold.  The pies (a small, yet meal sized pie) include options such as sweet potato, butter chicken, steak and cheese, pork and others. They are priced at 7.95 or 8.95 each and are delicious.  A side of cole slaw and a soda makes this a 16-17$ meal after tax, which is a bit rich. That being said, my BBQ pork pie was one of the tastiest things I have eaten in a while.  It is worth the effort to give the Pie Commission a shot. Fast, friendly service and a great pie."}
{"text":"The best thing I ate in Toronto. Not dim sum, not fish and chips in Kensington - this place. I was attracted by the sign outside that said they kept the crust simple to make it tender and flaky. I've watched enough food network to know that's the way to go. I got a brisket special with a side salad and the filling was great. But the CRUST. I had been thinking I must be going to all the wrong places in toronto's vaunted food scene - everything was good but nothing was life-changing. If I ever come to town again and don't come here trust I will have been afflicted with Alzheimer's. The salad was quality too - fresh mix of lettuces and even a little kale, cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumber slices cut smartly into quarters and a really tasty thick balsamic tasting dressing on the side. It balanced the rich pie perfectly."}
{"text":"New crowned favorite for savory pies!! Congratulations to Pie Commission for ruining all future mediocre pies and delivering serious side-eye judgement on lesser reproductions. I had their signature Braised Beef Rib Pie, chunks of slow braised beef in a homemade veal stock with sweet potato and mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious to the last bite. Even when that last bite was a day later and reheated for a second meal.   Don't be fancy with it. Just fold down the conveniently designed flaps and bite in. Be careful not to scorch yourself though because it's served piping-hot from the oven. The crust is seriously flaky. As in if-you-inhale-incorrectly-it-will-try-to-kill-you-level flaky. It's the perfect counterbalance to the densely packed savory innards. Really well flavored, not too salty and slightly sweet, with tender beef and chunks of sizable mushrooms to give a variation of texture. Writing this makes me want another one.   The only inconvenience is that there isn't alot of seating in the winter time. Just a bar with four stools, so come in the summer to take advantage of the patio furniture or ferry it home asap to devour."}
{"text":"Bloody great pies! That's for sure! They've earned their reputation. My steak & cheese today was excellent with a light flaky pastry, lots of tender pulled steak and cheese."}
{"text":"Came in one afternoon and grabbed the beef and beer pie. It's the perfect size for a large snack or a small meal. Crust was flaky and buttery, filling had a distinct flavor but the beer didn't overwhelm the beef (which was perfectly cooked). Overall a very satisfying bite. Service was friendly, and the atmosphere of the place feels modest and homey."}
{"text":"GREAT pies! Soft, buttery, flaky crust. I would recommend the butter chicken or the pulled pork.  Friendly staff, small location so better to take it home to eat. Frozen pies cook up just as good as the fresh!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing all good things about this spot and I finally had the chance to try it out as I was in the area.   You do receive an entire pie but it's like a baby pie, so cute! I did not underestimate the size and I was right because after eating the entire thing, I was perfectly stuffed. Not overly full and definitely not hungry at all.  I ordered one of the special pies (Braised Beef and Pulled Pork) but I am definitely returning to try one of the curry ones! They have seats if you want to enjoy your pie while it's fresh."}
{"text":"This is my fave place for savoury pies! They also have a tasty selection of sweet pies. The seasonal pies are always interesting flavour combinations and the regular menu is super tasty too! Inevitably, I walk out with a box of frozen pies - so convenient that I can bake them at home when I need a quick and easy meal - whenever I stop by for a freshly baked pie. The coleslaw is a must-have side for me because it's the right amount of crunch and creaminess, plus it accompanies the pies wonderfully."}
{"text":"I have been eating warm pies on location and buying frozen pies to eat at home ever since the first location opened.   I am a huge fan of their savoury pies! I honestly cannot pick a favourite because I like so many of their pies and decide on the flavour based on what I'm craving at the time. I enjoy the braised beef rib, beef 'n beer, butter chicken (slightly spicy), veg-ilicious, pulled pork. The seasonal flavours are great too!  I'd love to try the lobster shrimp, but it's been sold out whenever I visit.  As for the sweet pies, the cheesecake with raspberry is my fave!   I also enjoy the coleslaw. The dressing is tart and the perfect amount. The dried apricot adds a great texture and sweetness. I just wish the cabbage was chopped more finely. The carrots are julienned, yet the cabbage is chopped in large pieces, which makes for a tough texture."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place; since I live near by, I really, really wanted to like this place. The decor is cute, the concept is interesting and, I must admit, the crust is delightful. However, having ordered the vegetarian pie, I have to say I was disappointed.  Once you get past the buttery crust, the vegetables are thrown together in a pretty lack luster way. No particular flavours stand out, the cheese gets lost in the sauce, etc... I'm not saying this to hate on what seems like a really cool place: it's just that despite having a vegetarian option, this place is probably only a mainstay for meat eaters.   Pie Commission; you guys seem really cool, but on the vegetarian option you can do much, much better!"}
{"text":"What a great idea for last minute dinner! I've tried the pulled pork, butter chicken and mac n cheese pies - the pulled pork was my favorite. The fries and coleslaw are delicious as well. They have messed up my order a couple of times though."}
{"text":"Wow.  Tremendous, delicious savoury pies.  The fries are salty and terrific.  Note: the entrance is not on the Queensway itself, but you will have to go around the back.  Well worth the trip if you are looking for gourmet pies."}
{"text":"After Pie Commission's first year anniversary, I finally stopped by to pick up a beer and beef pie for lunch.  What more can I say except the positive reviews speak for themselves. I know it seems a tad expensive for an individual pie but, trust me, it is so worth it.  Years ago, when I worked in the Financial District, Acqua would occasionally offer a short rib pie and I always remember that being the best pie I ever ate until Pie Commission came along.  The crust is flaky but not messy flaky.  It's very flavorsome but doesn't have a rich lard or buttery type texture or taste - it's really something you have to experience yourself.  I could really taste the flavor of the beer coming from the pie as well.  One pie is very filling as they don't scrimp on the meat.  Quality is second-to-none - wouldn't be surprised to see another location pop up.  Just to note if you're not familiar with the area, there is NOT a lot of parking but you can easily park on the street and be in and out.  P.S. couldn't agree more with Christine C.'s review about all the good eats popping up now in Etobicoke.  I'm so getting a Tahiti Treat next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times trying each and every pie and I must say that none of the pies disappoint. My personal favourite has got to be the braised beef rib.  It's like eating a beef stew in a pie.   The thing that sets these pies above from the competition is that crust!  It's all so buttery and flaky goodness and it holds very well. You got to check out this place if you're ever in the queensway/islington area."}
{"text":"The Pie Commission is my go to quick dinner for when I don't have time to make food prior to class and they haven't disappointed me so far.  My go to order is the braised beef pie with a side of fries or salad. I find meat pies are very easy to mess up especially when the fillings begin getting more complex.   However, this place has it on point. The pie looks small but it's actually quite filling. The crust/pie itself is very soft and buttery and each bite tastes amazing. The salad and fries are nothing to write home about though and you could probably go without.   For some though, the pie might be too small of portion and the main complaint I've seen my friends make that it seems small for what you pay (~ 8 dollars).  I can't wait to check this place out again and try some of the other pies."}
{"text":"Ok pies at $9 each plus.  Ok dessert pies at $6 each.  Just don't add a side for an extra $2.40 (fries/salad/coleslaw): rip-off!  You are better off getting a drink for $1 to eat with your pie!"}
{"text":"My mother brought me here on a Saturday afternoon recently.  I am not a huge fan of pie or pastry at all but wow these guys have got it right! We were one of the first people there when they opened at 12 noon and they were quick and efficient with taking our orders. They were all incredibly friendly and gave us excellent recommendations. I tried the braised beef rib pie and my mother had the butter chicken pie. Both were absolutely delicious! My favourite was the braised beef, the pastry was flaky and baked wonderfully. The filling was just perfect! I would definitely go there again!   The location was easy to miss so if you are heading down there just make sure you are paying attention! They are not actually located right on the Queensway but behind a block of stores. You can make a right off of the Queensway onto Canmotor Avenue and then another right on Queen Elizabeth Blvd, the store is on your immediate right."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place. I love pot pies and stuff so I thought why not try a place like this? I am from out of town so we drove out of our way to try this place. I didn't know thy closed at 6 on a Saturday (which makes NO sense, it's a Saturday) and we went at about 5:40. They were out of everything but 2 or 3 kinds of pies. I'm not a fan of beef and that's really all they had left so after driving all that way to try some, I didn't even get to try a pie.   I will say that my husband really liked his and I did try his fries- they were good! I sampled his pie too and I will say I can see how people would love it. I feel bad giving them only 3 stars but when they were out of so many things how can I give them more for not even being able to get a pie? And again, why do they close so early on a Saturday?   Don't let this review discourage you, obviously from the reviews it is a great place. Just be warned and don't make the same mistakes I did nor you won't have a good experience.   Also please not that there are exactly 3 seats inside and a little counter. This is not a sit down place. You can order frozen pies to go and bake at home and it seems like that is where most of their business is."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find. If you go south on ruby Lang lane from queens way turn a quick right and there is a small pie shop on the right side with a small parking lot with some picnic tables.  I've tried most of their pies. The best one is probably their classic beef one but sometimes they have specialty pies such as the butter chicken or masala which is excellent. I also have tried their dessert pies and they are out of this world. Prices are reasonable compared to other pie companies."}
{"text":"I was finally in the area and got a chance to try this place. The verdict: delicious!!  Staff: Cheery and helpful with suggestions. No complaints!  Ambience: They are a small place, not much place to stand and wait for your order. Four people already felt crowded, but they have picnic seating outside. I just took mine to go.  Food: I had the sausage rolls which were amazing. Definitely not one of those foods you order while on a health kick; they were so juicy, and so sweet and savoury. I also had the Chicken Cheddar Bacon Mash Pie for dinner and a Apple Cranberry Pie for dessert. The pies were very good and very filling. They may be small but they fill you up. The mash was really good with the nice butter crust. The sweet pie was not as good since the crumble and crust were quite hard, but the filling with still delicious nonetheless!  I definitely think they have some of the best savoury pies, but sweet ones could use a little finesse."}
{"text":"I had the mixed berry crumble.  The pie was scrumptious.  My colleagues were eyeing the pie kind of like you would drunkenly eye someone across the bar that you find yummy.  It's like that but in Pie World."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad pie from The Pie Commission, and I have never a better pie anywhere else. I'm serious. I've had all manner of sweet and savoury pies from many, many places, but I will purposely go out of my way to get one of these pies.   I will drive from Oakville during my lunch break just to get one and have to eat it while working when I get back. I will leave the downtown core while it's rush hour and have to sit through traffic just to taste that flaky buttery crust. And if I'm so fortunate to attend a meeting or conference that is being catered by them (which I have), you best believe that I will carry as many of them as I can home.  You cannot go wrong with anything on their menu, and their frozen take home pies come out amazing.  Seriously, if you've read this far, you've wasted precious time that can be had eating their pies. I'm salivating thinking of the next time I'll get to have one."}
{"text":"A must try. I had the veggie pie and roasted beet soup, both delicious. Friendly staff to go along with. Great concept restaurant."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good, I love it, I want more of their piessssssss, we tried the meatball And it gosh darn good, mouth watering, I wanted to eat my girlfriends other half....they have different pies made everyday and you can add a side of fries, coleslaw or mixed greens with it, they should open a food truck for this place Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pies! I've tried the braised beef rib, jerk chicken (actually spicy!), chicken cheddar bacon mash and butter chicken pies - all are delicious! The best part of the pies for me is the flaky, buttery crust - heavenly! Get the frozen pies and bake at home since you get a bit of a better deal and it's perfect for times when you don't know what else to eat. We'll be back to try other flavours when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I had the braised beef pie. The crust of the pie was perfectly buttery flavoured and texture was nice flaky. The chunks of braised beef stuffed inside was tender, juicy and packed with flavour. It was a good first time experience at the pie commission but I don't think it's that special enough for me to come back for a second visit. Worth the try if it's your first time."}
{"text":"So sorry this is wrong location ... Review was intend for The Pie Commission on Dundas Street   I had the most amazing visit to the wonderful establishment!!!! I traveled all the way from HOUSTON, TEXAS to eat their delicious pies.  Staff was super friendly. Pies were encased in a delicious golden brown crust, savory and just mouthwatering...oh my goodness sooooooo good!  Visited July 10, 2015."}

{"text":"The pot pies from here are amazing, but pricier than your local supermarket... but, then again you're buying a fresh made, or frozen-fresh made meat pie with some fun and exciting pot pie flavors.  It's a take out joint more than anything...but, they do make a mighty fine pot pie!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of places that sell Meat Pies...but there really doesn't need to be with this place around. DELICIOUS savory meat pies that are INSTANTLY ready for you to eat, or frozen for you to take home and bake yourself. There aren't TOO many choices so deciding isn't an issue, but there is definitely the right amount of choices and they all sounds perfect.   The food is served literally instantly. The price is cheap. And yum."}
{"text":"Stouffer's has nothing on The Pie Commission!  Take everything that you remember from your childhood, re:  meal option when your mom hasn't cooked, uni staples, etc., burn, then bury them.  Location:  Around back of a block of retail stores, including Delux Paints and some hair salon.  Just east of Islington.  When you see the sign \"PIE\", pull in OR go south of Canmotor to access the parking lot.  Menu:  There are only a few staple pies on the menu, but plenty of specials, including soups, sides, and even a coupla desserts.  Ordered:  Braised Beef ($7.45) & Butter Chicken Pies ($6.95) with a side of fries ($2.95).  Fries are chip truck quality and therefore, yummy, and an absolute MUST if you even have the slightest craving from fries!  I only had a coupla nibbles of the Braised Beef, but I think I preferred the Butter Chicken.  Crust was delicious, buttery, & flaky!  I think both pies could have used a tad more salt, but had good flavour.  I remember The Pie Guyz having a better Butter Chicken filling, but then again, the owners there are Indian, so...crust at Pie Commission was flakier.  Great stop for a snack/in between/heavier lunch/lighter dinner-type meal.  Obviously not for those on a health kick!  ;)    Tip:  Primarily takeout as there is only a few stools with a counter to eat at."}
{"text":"This place has always been on my To-Go List. I got the Braised Beef and my brother got the pulled pork (which was their seasonal pie).  The Braised Beef was my favourite of the two. There were nice chunks of beef and I believe there was sweet potato there as well! A good pie needs a great crust and this pie delivered. The crust was flakey and buttery. It was just a delight!    There were a lot of condiments to choose from, which is a plus and the service was quick as well. There are limited seatings indoors but there are seating outside!"}
{"text":"These are proper pies! Full of stuff...not like Kanga Pies, which are yummy but skimpy on meat. I have had the sausage rolls and beef& cheese...divine."}
{"text":"The address is 935 The Queensway but you won't see this along the Queensway because it is at the back of the building.   This place is not really a dine in place. There is 1 table, 3 stools  inside and a table outside with beach chairs.   We had the pie of the day Steak and cheese pie and the Butter Chicken pie. Serving size is individual size, good enough to fill me up. The pie is flaky. Butter chicken has a hint of spiciness. Personally, I liked the Steak and Cheese pie better than the Butter Chicken.   You could get side orders of Coleslaw, hand cut fries, or salad.   We tried the chocolate cherry milkshake. I believe this is just a summer special because it says on the sign, last day today. Generous whip cream topping. I like it but could only enjoy a few sips because it's too sweet for me.   The place is busy for take outs. From the time we walked in until we finished our 2 pies in about 30 mins, the place was never out of customers.   I didn't have time for dessert but the dessert pies looks good.     Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Managed to walk into this gem before the storm of people arriving. Ambience is very hip. Ordered steak+cheese, beef rib with coleslaw and a sausage roll. Pies came in a cool looking box.   Started with the sausage roll. Crispy and flakey on the outside, nice soft sausage on the inside. All of the pies had a marvellous crisp. It was buttery and extremely flakey to the bite. Smell was irresistible and overwhelming. These pies were truly a meat pie as it was stuffed with a generous portion of meat! The coleslaw was perfect to cut through the savouriness of the flakey and buttery crust. Thank the lord that I live far from this place or I would be a mess on a daily basis."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at The Pie Commission.  I've had their pies at events but have never been to their restaurant.  I had an Uncle Smokes' Chicken Pot Pie and a diet coke.  In the past, I've had beef-based ones so thought I'd try something different.  This was a good pie.  The smokiness from the chicken gave it a bit of a bacony taste, which I was okay with.  I'd get it again.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Pie Commission came highly recommended. I was in the neighbourhood so I checked them out. No signage from the road so I drove past the location twice. Tucked away in a small unit behind the Main Street building  on The Queensway is this little gem. Simple menu. Good wholesome food. Lots of parking. A small outside seating area. Typically take out food. I bought a 4 pack of uncooked pies. I tried their sausage rolls, and I have to say I died and went to heaven. The pastry was flakey not dry and the sausage meat flavourful was packed tightly inside. Brought me back to a moment in time inside a bakery in Ireland where pies and sausage rolls where baked fresh daily. Looking forward to trying the pies I purchased. No doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"A cute little spot on Dundas great for dessert or a quick bite! We tried the Braised Beef Rib, Steak and Cheese and the Coconut dessert pie. The Braised Beef is supposedly their most popular but it was underwhelming compared the Steak and Cheese which is amazing!! Their Coconut pie is ok - the asian coconut buns are yummier :3  The savoury pies are overpriced for the portion imo - they're 5 inches and with tax ~$10. Would like to come back and try the others!  A bonus! If you Tweet @ them they'll fav/retweet and reply hehe"}
{"text":"I tried Pie Commission for the first time a few weeks ago after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. Needless to say I was not disappointed! I had their Hogsmash pie which was stuff with pork, corn, kale, acorn squash (and I think bacon?). It was delicious!   The only thing I was disappointed about was that I didn't notice they had a jerk chicken pie!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Savour Toronto food tour.  Had a sample cut of a braised beef pie and a vegetarian pie.  Both my wife and I were very impressed by our sample so we decided to come back after the tour and purchase some additional pies.  We grabbed a steak and cheese pie and a featured quiche.  Both were phenomenal.  All pies are individually sized and are 4 inches in diameter.  Decent size for a meal, but to top up i would probably order it with a side.  The Featured steak and cheese pie was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  If this item is feature,  you absolutely must try it. The atmosphere is small and cozy, but this place is primarily a to go location I would say.  There's maybe about 15 seats for those who would rather dine in.  Excellent experience.  The product had earned its reputation."}
{"text":"Good, but it didn't quite live up to its hype.  As other reviewers have noted, the crust is out of this world and the pies are very filling.  I split the butter chicken, which could have used more sauce, and the steak, which was good but not exceptional, with a friend.  The biggest disappoint was the customer service.  I had really wanted to try the beer and beef, but when I tried to order it the woman said \"we are all out\", so I ordered the steak instead.  However, about 10 minutes later, when we were in the middle of eating our pies, someone else came in and ordered a beer and beef.  I have no idea why the cashier just said \"we are all out\" rather than asking if I wanted to wait 10 minutes.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"We had a lunch.Limited seating,already forewarned by friendly staff before the visit.One table with 3 stools{?}.Lucky these were available. Ordered the butter chicken,and a braised beef pie ,side of salad,along with an order of poutine,with some drinks.Quite surprised at how dense the pie is,and the crust is good.I don't like crust,and ate most of mine:)  Their entrance is actually on Queen Elizabeth Blvd.side of the building.There is parking directly in front of their store here.  First visit for both of us,and I can say it was a hit."}
{"text":"The BF and I were craving a substantial snack after our visit to Costco. We shared a butter chicken pie. The crust was nice and flaky and held the traditional tasting butter chicken ingredients inside. The pie was not messy since they kept the sauce to a minimum. Overall, great pie, hit the spot."}
{"text":"Savory pies are a patently un-American concept, so I was a little wary when I stumbled into this pie shop. However, when you're as famished as I was, anything will do.   I'm so glad I stepped inside. I had the vegalicious pie (the other options all had meat or dairy in them, but this one had neither), and it lived up to its name - veggie *and* delicious. The pie crust was warm, flaky, and moist. The filling - which included kale, cauliflower, and carrots - was zesty, even more so when I doused the inside of the pie with some Frank's.   I'd be back here all the time if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Love the buttery fluffy pie crust!! Ordered \"Butter Chicken Pie\" and \"Braised Beef Pie\". My favourite is the \"Butter Chicken\"-butter fluffy crust with flavourful curry chicken w/ chickpeas; it reminds me of the Malaysian \"Karipap\" aka \"Curry Puff\".The \"Braised Beef Pie\" beef is so tender and juicy. Definitely will be back again and try out other pies."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner when you're feeling indulgent. Hearty, flavourful fillings wrapped up in a flaky crust; what's not to love? This place is is close enough to work that I grab lunch from there about once a month, so I've had all of their regular menu offerings and a good handful of their seasonal pies, and I've only ever had one I didn't like.   So why only 4 stars? I usually get a salad or coleslaw with my pie, and they put both the pie and side in the same carton, without a divider in between. Unless you eat it right away (which is pretty hard to do given the limited seating at the place) the dressing from the salad or coleslaw pools all over the bottom of the carton and makes the pie crust soggy. I guess I could just not have the side... but the little bit of veg makes me feel a little less guilty about eating a pie this good!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the crust is super flaky and tasty, but the fillings were disappointing, some were too salty and others just not tasty.  Hubby actually waited for the Beef and Beer Pies and the special pulled pork pies to be ready so it was extra disappointing to not enjoy them.  The sausage roll was okay but not great - again the best part was the pastry.  We ordered 2 dessert pies, a fruit crumble and peanut butter banana and again - great crust but fillings made us sad.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Didn't know this was in my neighbourhood. Tried the braised beef pie. The crust is flaky & buttery. It is excellent but is missing a bit of salt. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Whoa this place is good. Listen to the reviews. The thing about pie, is that love is of paramount importance as far as ingredients go. And I taste the love. I have never had a pie here that I felt they skimped out on. I've traversed the Gardiner from the east end to eat here. Excellent pies make for a worthy incentive. Can't wait to explore other pie options.  I would rate them a solid 4/5 for food but since their packaging is cool and eco-friendly... +1 star for packaging, bringing them to a whopping 5/5 in my books."}
{"text":"I loved this place Customer service is stellar The pies are to die for ..super tasty nice flaky pie crust consistency and flavorful on the inside Serving size is amazing i went in for lunch and couldn't finish my pie had the rest as a snack after work Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The sausage rolls are easily my favourite things to order here. They're so fresh and tasty!  As well every time I've been the service has been very nice! Great consistent restaurant overall."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. The steak & cheese pie was a perfect blend of flavor and the beer on tap complimented it really well."}
{"text":"WOW ... I did not expect meat pies this delicious from OUR side of the Atlantic.  I have been fortunate to be in London a few times to experience the real deal.  So my expectations were a tad high (or possibly unreasonably high) but wow, did Pie Commission ever do it justice and then some!  Do you like amazing flavours, tender chunks of meat or vegetables, the flakiest and butteriest crust, and eating incredible food for less than $10?  THIS IS YOUR PLACE...sorry, I'm that excited.    A note for everyone who has never been here before... I was utterly confused to find this place at first.  I turned off from Queensway into a L shaped parking lot and was completely confused on where the storefront is.  The actual door and storefront is facing AWAY from Queensway, it is down the stairs from the parking lot and literally on the south wall of the building.  This place is mostly a take away place but in the summer, there are two picnic tables and a few Muskoka chairs you can sit on and enjoy.    Inside is a small but clean storefront with big clear menus and a peak of the sweets and savouries to devour.  And when I mean devour... once you try it, you'll agree.  I love the fact that all pies are less than $9 and for a combo, easily under $13.  For a phenomenal and filling meal, It's unheard of in Toronto.  We got the combos... butter chicken, beer and beef, and  pulled pork.  We got the salad to go with it.  I know ... wha salad?  But if you have taste buds and like vegetables, the vinaigrette is laced with some magic.  Butter crust... yes I'm writing about the crust alone cause it's that deserving.  How many times you've had pie where you bit into it and its a soggy mush or its flavourless cause it has shortening or its overbaked so its a concrete slab.  Well, let Pie Commission enlighten you on how amazing crust can be.  This one is so flakey, buttery (you actually smell the butter and it totally melts on your tongue), crispy light that it shatters as you bite right into it (sorry, was I supposed to use a fork instead of digging straight in?), and they bake it so its a nice deep caramel so the flavours are wonderfully enhanced.  Yes.. they do pie crust right here.  Butter chicken ..  I was surprised on how good it was.  Seeing I just came from Pukka, I had a great rendition there and I would say Pie Commission is almost as good.  There's no heat or nuanced spicing but it was still amazing.  Its like an excellent home cooked curry done by someone's grandmother.  Big chunks of chicken and plenty of it with lots of chick peas and vegetables. All wrapped in a lot of smooth curry sauce. Definite winner  Beef and Beer ... Another excellent one pie.  Oh god, the sauce is so good.  You can taste the full flavour of the beef and beer.  Just an excellent pairing plus the onions just add to the flavour.  It was so good and the gravy... just made kept everything so tender and moist.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Salad side... I know, what is so damn exciting about leafy greens.  Well, the vinaigrette ... if you love a dressing that completely turns vegetables exciting.  I would recommend to try.  It is incredibly unusual as it is sweet, tart, and sour.  But the sweetness hits you first and then all the flavours jump in.  Coconut pie... To be continued.  I'm eating it tonight!  I would report on the Pulled Pork but someone didnt want to share cause it was that too good.  Really!    It doesnt open too late into the night so if you're wanting a pie for dinner, come in earlier so you dont leave disappointed if you want to eat one right there. When we went, they only had half their selection and selling out soooo quickly.  About 10 other customers there popped in and grabbed their pies to go in less than 20 minutes.  And everyone often left with more than 3 or 4 boxes.    For those who like to eat much later, grab a few of the frozen pies to go... yes thats right! You can indulge in these amazing pies at home fresh by buying the pies frozen and baking it in your own oven.  They even offer a discount for 4+ pies!    Overall, I'll keep coming back to try all the flavours and also the seasonal selection.  Just delicious!"}
{"text":"The pie crust really is just the best and I've enjoyed every flavour so far. Fries are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Great delivery spot! I though the packaging was great, it was minimal but functional.   I really enjoyed the 3 types we got - Braised beef, beef and beer and the chicken one. My favourite was the chicken one which was surprising. The beef ones were okay, I remember them being underwhelming. We also got a sausage roll which was DELICIOUS! And the fries were perfect. The crust was flaky perfection."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets.   Everything about this place is just perfect. The food is out of this world and the service is always amazing. The sweet ladies working there always have a huge smile and are always ready to guide you through the menu selection.  I usually order their limited time offerings but their regular menu is solid too. I shared the steak and cheese pie and the pulled pork pie with a friend (best way to enjoy more than one flavor). The steak and cheese pie was really good but the star of the show was the pulled pork pie. The crust is just too good. The filling was really flavorful as well.  Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone because hey, who doesn't like a proper pie?"}
{"text":"THE PIES ARE DELICIOUS!!! Only reason why I rated this a 4 star opposed to a 5 is because the server asked if I wanted a side to go along with my pie and as I contemplated he said the coleslaw was really really good, and unfortunately it was really really bad. Coleslaw was drenched in a taste-less dressing. It was like an iceberg lettuce salad, chopped up with pieces of unsweetened tangerines and absolutely cringe worthy. No crunch factor, it was a soggy pile of odd flavours that didn't really pair well together. It did not surpass one bite, and was rather a waste of money. I will be returning for the pies! Thankfully the pies are spectacular. Flavourful, heavily packed on the inside and flaky on the outside."}
{"text":"As an Aussie/Kiwi household, we were curious to try this place out. As such, I'm reviewing these guys as if they'd tried to mimic a Four & Twenty.   The pastry was close, not quite flaky enough, but slightly sweet which wasn't right. We were offered cutlery. Whaaa? It's a pie. You should be able to eat it with one hand (while giving the Collingwood cheer squad a piece of your mind with the other hand).   Turns out though, you need the cutlery. And 55 serviettes. The mince doesn't have that slightly gelatinous texture like an Aussie meat pie, it's bolognese sauce inside a pie, more juice than gravy. Consequently there is enough juice dripping out it's like eating a mango in summer. It also comes in a holder that is more cumbersome than helpful. A paper bag should be all you need.  My pie ended up collapsing everywhere, so I gave in and got the knife and fork, smothered the thing in sauce and ploughed on.  You could never in a million years eat this type of pie at the footy, but if you're willing to drive out to Etobicoke, stop in and sample, just don't expect an authentic Anzac pie experience.   If they're not going for an Aussie pie though, it's good. Get takeaway and cook them at home with a salad for a Tuesday cheat dinner. Flavour is nice, they're just bloody messy!"}
{"text":"A small, slightly hidden shop. Amazing pies. They were fresh, crusts were flakey and very flavourful. Parking is minimal holding 4-5 cars at most. Due to its size, there is no dining area, but a couple picnic tables and chairs outside allow you to chill and enjoy you pie with friends. Each pie is individual-sized. Don't forget to ask for cutlery if you are enjoying it there."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to scratch Pie Commission off of my list of places to check out, mainly because I would only visit the neighborhood on Sundays when they're closed. The wait was definitely worth it. Trying out dishes that I don't normally eat (like savoury meat-filled pies) is an adventure I like to indulge in every so often. This is a perfect spot for that.  Must-try items: Braised Beef Rib pie Any savoury pie w/ fries  They have dessert pies here which I plan to try as well. The brisket pie tastes really good. It feels like a very old school, hearty, classic meal that'll get you right and full. They sell them frozen as well which is a bonus for takeout situations. You can heat them up at home whenever you feel for one.  I expected it to be a pricier place with stingy portions for some reason, but I was wrong. The pies are a great value meal and a rare experience. Staff were very polite and friendly on my first visit They'll walk you through the entire menu if you need it. I definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"+1 for Lambert's parking suggestion  The original hole in the wall location is great for take out but dining in isn't recommended. However, that doesn't change the fact that they have some pretty darn good pies! Plus they come in the cutest and convenient take out boxes ever. I've tried both the braised beef and the pulled pork, but pulled pork is my favourite (for now...)."}
{"text":"Their pies are so SO good! After my first trip, I was back within a week! I tried the braised beef and the pulled pork pie, with my favourite being the latter. Both times I got thick cut fries on the side which did not disappoint. The most impressive was the speed of my order - I didn't even have enough time to sit down and check in! I love that this location has seating for dining in compared to the Queensway location, but I think the prices may be a bit higher as a result (~$0.50-$1)."}
{"text":"Wowowow!  Came here,  thanks to Yelp.  Absolutely love pies and now that we found this place, we're IN LOVE!!  Pies of all sorts, Jerk chicken,  Butter chicken,  pulled pork, braised rib, etc.  Ethnically palatable!     A little pricey but worth it!  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I think the ratings says it all. The buttery flakiness of the crust alone is making my mouth water. The filings are all done very well. If u order the pie hot, it comes with a mixed green salad. Can also order baked frozen to take home. The veggie pie is surprising very good as well. Just wished they made a chicken pot pie. Be forewarned the spicy pies are extremely spicy enough to burn your mouth."}
{"text":"Great pie joint with amazing combos and specials.  Home cooking kicked up a few notches."}
{"text":"Yep... The others were all fantastic too... Chicken... And I can't remember the other names!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to visit this place, and must say very very yummy. I tried the chicken cheddar pie that was the only one left. But hey I loved it. I am going back and will recommend it."}
{"text":"The Pie Commission is a great place to go when you need food in a jiffy!  The pies are filling and they also have some interesting flavours (especially the seasonal ones, and some sweet ones as well.).  Staff are friendly.  The main things I wish could be improved: I find they close a bit early - hard to go if you are having a late dinner.  The pies can sometimes be a bit heavy for my liking / difficult to get a dairy free option.  Every time I happen to go, the flavour that I want they've run out of.  Lastly, it can be difficult to find parking, and I've furtively had to park in the upstairs' hairdressers parking lot to get my paws on these pies.  Otherwise, Pie Commission is a much welcomed institution to Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"Sinfully delicious! Great spot for a treat.Their pies are worth the price!"}
{"text":"They say a pie is only as good as its crust.. In this case..it is true! The pastry in all the pies are flaky and buttery! Although some of the stuffings in the pies can be hit or miss. We have been here a dozen times and really enjoy it thus the four stars.  We would love to have them bring back the Caplansky pie! It was soooo good! But the regular menu items are always reliable."}
{"text":"Overall, I was extremely happy with my visit; food was up to par with my expectations, service was fine, atmosphere was exactly what I expected.  Food: With limited options around 6pm, I chose the Beef n' beer while my friend got the Beef Brisket Rib (i think that what it was called). Both were fantastic, though a little smaller than I would have preferred for the price. I also got a side of fries because I knew I wouldn't be full off the one pie.  Service: They don't really serve your table here, so the most I can say is that the cashier was super nice & very friendly. One thought is that they didn't have a very big selection of available pies at the time we went, I suppose we caught the tail end of a pie-cycle.  Environment: The rustic/indie vibe was very fitting with the chalkboard wall, wood textured tables & metal chairs. I can't say it was the biggest place in the world, and when we walked in from the sweltering heat the air was just room temperature, so not too hot not too cold (though we wish it were colder)."}
{"text":"Pain to find parking but the pies are worth to try. Very limited parking outside so go early to best the rush. The place smells great even from the out. I have actually hoping for one big pie that I can bring home to rebake but unfortunately they only sell individual size pies do I order four of their daily feature pies. Each one that I have tried tasted amazing. The down side was that the pricing for the pie seems a little high. But it is worth trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"Everything tastes great! They do run out of the tastiest pies as the day goes on. I don't recommend the frozen ones. Just buy the ready to eat."}
{"text":"*Beyond The Box Store: An Etobicoke Exclusive*   I'm not too good to hit a chain for household necessities, nor am I above a strip mall crawl from time to time (get your nails done, party supplies and sushi in one stop? Glorious). However, I rarely think of this area as being good for much else. Yesterday, a buddy showed me the light. After a delicious lunch at Stoney's, I popped in here for some pies to go.   Savoury pies appear to be the name of the game, but I went for two apple and sour cherry crumble pies. I didn't even heat mine up when I had mine for tea time later that day, and it was perfect. The delicious meat pie aroma of this place will live on in my dreams until I go back and try one. Better yet, I'll pop into their new Dundas W location because that's waaaayyy closer to me. Yessir, I've got eyes for pies."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5 Hey, I was in the area for a pick up and seen this place the second time, so I decided to try this place for lunch. Small and compact place which is everything is in front of you(Dessert pies and Hot fresh pies).  Ordered for my friend and I the Beef Rib and Butter Chicken Pie(s).  Pie could have been a little bigger. Flavours for both pies are done well, especially the buttered flaky crust. Less 1.5 stars are the price point, could be cheaper by a dollar so you can get more customers in or buying take out. Happy Nom-ming\!!"}
{"text":"Very nice pie place.  We had the tandoori chicken and beef ribs pies and they were very nice.  Flavorful yet subtle definitely worth coming back and trying some other ones."}
