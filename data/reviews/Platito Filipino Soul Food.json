{"text":"FOOD IS SO GOOD. luckily we made a reservation here because it was busy! Make sure you save room for desserts too. Lechon Kawali, Chicken and Ube Waffles is a must!"}
{"text":"I am Canadian born Filipino so my review will be based on experiences I've had from numerous Filipino potlucks and dining experiences at Filipino restos in the city. 

I had their brunch and it seems their 'silog' dishes are on point.  'Silog' is basically a breakfast meal consisting of garlic fried rice, some sort of fried meat and eggs -Filipino's version of bacon, eggs and hashbrowns. If you like garlic then definitely get either the tapsilog, longsilog or tosilog. I actually wanted the Pares Hilton (silog stewed beef) but they prob ran out from their grand opening the previous day. 

We also had the 'Bok Bok Chicken and Ube Waffles' which is more of a fusion dish...Filipinos love their chicken but it's rarely fried and I don't think I've ever had pancakes or waffles in the Philippines. The waffles are purple because they mix Taro (purple yam) in the batter which gives it a nice flavor but also didn't give it a very crispy outside (or maybe because the syrup was already on them)  but paired with the extra crispy fried chicken it's perfect imo. The maple butter is really intense and really sweet so I used it sparingly. 

Overall the staff is very friendly, presentation and d√©cor is great but they seemed a bit disarrayed...understandable as we were there right when they opened the doors and this is their first week being open and they prob had a crazy night at their grand opening. I'm really routing for this place to do well as I think they seem to have a good idea of how to serve Filipino food for Toronto. 

I will definitely be trying out their dinner menu very soon."}
{"text":"So disappointed... I was really had high hopes for this place but was really disappointed when we finally had a chance to try it. The staff and service was good, however the food was lacking. We ordered adobo chicken wings, lumpia, sisig pork and shrimp pancit. The lumpia and chicken wings were good, not great and nothing special. But the sisig pork and pancit were so bland. The presentation of the food was good but the taste was severely lacking. 

Wouldn't go back because it really doesn't satisfy the craving for Filipino comfort food."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner and was hoping it would be better than brunch but somehow it was even more disappointing. Firstly, the white sangria was different. It was the only redeeming thing I had last time and it couldn't even remain consistent. We ordered the kare kare and the pork sisig and rice which was an additional $2. It's funny that the rice is additional when even the servers ask you, \"are you sure you don't want rice?\" If you know that it's supposed to be served with rice why would it not be included? The kare kare was good, the shrimp paste is actually in the peanut sauce so be warned if you're not familiar with shrimp paste, it is an acquired taste. The pork sisig was awful. Platito's tagline is Filipino Soul Food and the sisig was not. Real pork sisig has pork ears, cheek, etc. which gives the dish its unique texture and flavour. Platito played it safe by serving up some lean diced pork meat. 

On a brighter note, the service is still great and very slow. I didn't realize the kare kare came with eggplant which I am allergic to and they were more than happy to replace it with different veggies. Just wish the food was better and came quicker."}
{"text":"I think the restaurant still needs to work out its kinks and perhaps continue to tweak it's menu/ pricing. However, location is great as it gives downtown Torontonians another option for filipino food! This review probably seems heavier on the negative aspects of our experience but only because I think there is room for improvement! :) I would definitely be willing to give it another try in a month or so! A patio with good eats is always welcome!

We went for dinner on a Saturday night but was surprised to see the menu was only for appetizers and all day brunch. To boot, a few of the popular items were apparently sold out. My garlic rice was cold when it arrived and our lumpia Shanghai (noted as an appetizer) arrived much later than our mains. Portions were fair, although the tapsilog was a bit too sweet for our liking. The calamansi shandy is tasty but not worth $7 for such a small glass (a bottle of San Miguel is $6 and calamansi juice is $3...will mix up my own next time, hehe)."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience coming to Platito for brunch. We waited 40 minutes for our food only to be told, when one of the dishes came out, that they had run out of the pork 30 minutes ago and if we would like to order something else. The service was terrible. It took them 20 minutes to service us coffee. In the end the food was okay but the service was horrible. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good quality Filipino restaurant, and Platito's a good place to visit. The staff are very welcoming and nice, not the we-have-to-be-nice \"nice\" but genuinely nice. They're very attentive with whatever you need as well, from the moment you walk in until you're ready to leave. The food was good, too. I'm excited to try the other items on their menu that I haven't tried yet. Definitely coming back with more of my friends with me."}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner on a weeknight. Place was packed. We ordered 3 kinds of appetizers: skewer, spring rolls and lechon kawali. For main entree, we had Kare Kare and Chicken Inasal. Food was tasty and presentation is unique. I just find the price of Kare Kare to steep for the amount you get. 
Service was good."}
{"text":"Just had take-out from Platito. First off, I want to thank the owners for expanding the limited Filipino eatery/dine-in option in the city, my partner and I have been wanting this for a while. As for the food, what a treat to have amazingly yummy bites. I ordered the Bicol express and it tasted the way I thought it would--thick and savory. My partner had the adobo fried pork chop, he scarfed that sh*t down and said it was incredible! We will definitely be back to dine in. Thanks for a wonderful dinner guys!"}
{"text":"I've never tried Filipino food before, so going to Platito was an absolute amazing flavor experience. Don't ask me how but it just works! Taking soul & classic food staples with a Flipino twist. I will need to go again to sample of the other dishes, but I recommend the Bok Bok Chicken & Ube waffles, and the sigsig fries. Love this. *sidenote the restaurant was recently hit by fire damage. Many other establishments were hit hard, so i really Platito reopens real soon."}
{"text":"A great take on filipino food! The chicken and ube waffles was good! The service was really good for me. The waitress was super nice and came to our table in reasonable times. The ube cheesecake wasnt too sweet for me. And they ran out some food on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and was put on a wait list immediately (was very busy so was hopeful for good food). Waiter said estimated 45 minute wait but should be shorter. Decided to wait because I was super excited to try the chicken and waffles dish. We ended up waiting for ONE HOUR and only was seated after pestering the waiter again. He said he was busy packing take out and finally led us to our seat. We went upstairs and found 4 empty tables while there was still a huge lineup outside (not enough staff). We go in and are informed that they were sold out of every signature item from fish, ube shake, ube waffles, and waffle and chicken (they should have let us know or put a sign outside for people waiting 1 hour + to get in). 

Already disappointed I decided to still give them a chance ordered the stewed beef dish and it was SO SALTY and tasted like super salty and sour beef (no spices no flavors just a whole lot of nastiness) and was so incredibly disappointing and the portion was so small for 15 dollars it was ridiculous. We also overheard other tables complaining about their food and lack of communication for their ample amounts of sold out food. They have been open for 7 months and should have been MUCH better at understanding high volumes and meeting demand. Reading other reviews it seems that having enough supply is an ongoing problem for them. Who knows if their chicken and waffle is worth the hype. I won't ever be returning due to the extraordinarily bad service and lack of professionalism at this establishment."}
{"text":"Patio is nice. Food was great. Restaurant was very busy so be patient when dining."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Took some work friends that aren't that familiar with filipino food. Although their menu has more of a modern twist, they really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Went on their grand opening night. I understand it was maybe more than they anticipated, but we waited over an hour to get our food. We made reservations for 8:30pm and we got there right on time and were seated quickly, which was nice. We had already decided to walk out and just pay for our drinks, because the food was taking so long, when they finally told us our food was coming. The food itself was good. Very flavourful. The price of each dish was respectable for the portion and quality of the food. I would have liked to have tried their dessert, which I had seen so heavily advertised on BlogTO, but after having waited so long for the food, we just wanted to get out of there as fast as we could. It's too bad that that wait had sort of ruined our experience at this seemingly high-potential new restaurant. 

I would still recommend going here, but maybe after some time when they've been open for longer and have ironed out whatever problems they were having that night I went there."}
{"text":"Great food, cool ambiance and friendly staff! Will definitely come back when they officially open to try their halo halo!"}
{"text":"*Visited September, 2016*

Located in Baldwin Village, we got a spot on the nice and airy patio. Inside, there are two levels with colourful murals (done by local Filipino artists) on the wall, with soft but trendy music.

We asked for recommendations from our server - who had to ask another waitress to help because she was unfamiliar with Platito's menu (?). The second waitress was significantly more knowledgable and gave us a few options on their handpicked menu.

We started off with a couple of BBQ pork skewers, which were flavoured nicely and has that smoky taste fresh from the grill. Be sure to take a full bite of the meat and its topping though, otherwise you'll encounter a super sharp sour taste from the pink onions.

Platito has an all-day brunch on the weekend (no normal mains), therefore almost all the main dishes have eggs in it! We decided to forego the Bok Bok Chicken and Ube Waffles that we see everywhere on Instagram, and opted for their recommendations. Sadly, they didn't really do it for us. They are both pretty bland, which might be to balance out the saltiness of the fried rice, but a little more seasoning would be nice. The beef on the Pares Hilton is quite soft, but really dry and tasteless to be honest. The garlic fried rice with the eggplant bore more flavour than the beef - probably because the eggs were even more bland than the meat? Servers were also very keen on taking away plates, even when you haven't told them that you're done just yet.

Then the infamous ube waffle. The ube ice cream was quite nice! The coconut topping was a nice touch. The waffle was OK, kind of on the soft side.

Platito was alright for the price, but nothing spectacular. It's an interesting experience if you want to try something different. The service was OK, although some of the staff doesn't seem very informed about the food but worth a visit for Instagram."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I think it was too hyped up for me to really appreciate. I had the Tosilog and a friend the Bok Bok Chicken and & Ube Waffles, and it was all just fine. No real complaints here, but the food did not blow me away. The staff was friendly enough, but a little disorganized. The outdoor sitting was nice, but there wasn't really anything that would make me come back. It definitely was not the comforting soul food I was expecting, but more some run of the mill over priced fast food."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that hasn't even had its grand opening yet, Platito is already making waves!

It's not easy to start a new restaurant in TO, but I predict these guys are going to succeed-- and not just because their only downtown competition is Lamesa and Kanto by Tita Flips. They'll succeed because their location is terrific (Baldwin Village is downtown TO's greatest secret), the venue is multifaceted (patio, bar area, and 30-seat area upstairs), and because their food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We should of taken the hint when we saw the \"closed\" sign on the door- but it was open. Went here on Valentines Day (today), there wasn't too many ppl when we arrived. We placed our order & we cannot believe how long the drinks & food came. Aside to that, the utensils were not clean. We even heard another couple ask for clean utensils. Another two cancelled their appetizer order, as I heard, their main dish was served first.  The food came & was delicious .. small portions tho.. the Ube waffle & ice cream was very good .. but would not come back because the service took toooo long !!! No excuses, the place was not busy at all, when we arrived. It only picked up after an hour - ppl started coming for lunch .."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their selections of Ube desserts! Super tasty and different from your average sweets. Food was excellent too. All the dishes had very sharp flavors, especially the meat dishes! I had the Sisig fries as well as the Bicol Express. The Bicol Express was super tasty. The beef was so tender and flavorful. The Sisig fries were alright..a bit too salty. The Bico, which was the sweet mango sticky rice dessert was so bomb!!! Definitely recommend if you love Mango :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant decoration is really nice, especially upstairs. It seems like most of the staff is philipino and a lot of the guests are too. Which shows that this place is good and authentic. The food is really good and filling, especially the desserts. They use ube  (purple yam) in a lot of their desserts and it's excellent. It gives an original twist to more classic desserts. I definitely recommend the ube cheesecake."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Came here for date night after seeing it being advertised. The portions are small and the food is SO EXPENSIVE for the quality and the amount you get! Got the kare kare and it literally came with only 3 pieces of meat! Not even ox tail and it was $18! And that's not even with rice! Rice is an additional 2.50 or something but there's nothing special about the rice! The kare kare also was COLD when it arrived.... fish sauce was already mixed in so you can't customize how fishy you want it. In my opinion if you're going to charge the price of a fancy restaurant, at least make the ambiance like one as well. I didn't appreciate sitting on high chairs near the entrance where people were waiting and staring at me while I ate. I literally felt like a zoo animal being looked at! Not the mention the doors were constantly opening and closing so the cold air made my already cold food even colder. People waiting were loud and none of the waiters bothered to tell them to quiet down. It really ruined my experience. Not worth it and will not be returning."}
{"text":"So glad there's more Filipino food in Toronto. Is it just me or blogto suddenly discovered Filipino food...

Great food offered here, amazing adobo , loved the crispy outer layer, the pickles compliments it well. My favourite was the kare kare, but the portion offered was lacking for the price. Garlic rice needs some work, not flavorful enough, but might be because of the concern that not everyone can handle lot of garlic.

Really enjoyed the brunch here as well, but like any other food and drinks here, quite pricy, I would certainly come back here whenever I crave some Filipino food. Service have room for improvement, it is a fairly new restaurant still,  we will see."}
{"text":"Location: About a 7 minute walk from St. Patrick subway station. It's on Baldwin street so there are tons pf restaurants around!

Price: Pancit bihon with pork ($10+$3) and Kare kare $18.

Food: The flavourings were amazing! The pacit has fried glass noodles with pieces of perfectly crispy pork belly, which is one of my favourite Filipino foods. I think this one is the best bang for your buck. The kare kare is a thick beef stew that's bursting with flavour. They offer to give you rice which complements the stew well. The portion sizes are medium to large (for a girl). Everything is on the saltier side, but that may be necessary for the awesome taste (so remember to drink lots of water after!)

Service: The waitress was very accommodating and food came relatively fast. 

Overall: Very delicious restaurant that I'd definitely go back to (especially for the pork belly slices!). Next time I want to try the purple ube dessert. The menu items are quite pricey, but you can just order ube ice cream (which isn't listed on the menu)."}
{"text":"With all the hype of the ube ice cream and waffle, I head to this place to try the legendary dessert.  Was I expecting too much? For $13, you get a ball of ice cream on a waffle with a few biscuit sticks.  The presentation of the dish was beautiful, but I expected a flavour bomb of ube. Nope.... I got a light flavour ice cream on a waffle. No ube flavour.

My companion ordered a shrimp dish. The description was well written which made my friend order. It's a battered fried jumbo shrimp appetizers. Upon eating, we were wondering why it was texture different. All jumbo shrimp still had the shell on. We are used to having shrimp fried food with shell on, usually it's crunchy and good texture. The batter was thick, but didn't allow the shell to get crispy. So crispy batter plus soggy shell. 

My party and I felt all the media review was not represented in our experience."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here when they opened - especially because I saw the kamayan they hosted on social media. Well, don't trust what restaurants post online for PR. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated outside. We ordered Kare-Kare, rice, the Ube waffle dessert and an Ube Milkshake. The Ube Milkshake was very icey and not very creamy. I didn't taste much Ube which was disappointing. Then it started raining. When it rained, the staff didn't do anything like try and bring out umbrellas or offer to move people inside. We just stood up, grabbed our milkshakes and went inside ourselves. 

There were no seats inside the restaurant so we were just standing in the narrow hallway in front of the bar dodging servers walking past with food. None of the staff tried to accommodate or re-seat us. Then our food got here and that was awkward because we didn't have a table. When we finally did get a table, the Kare-Kare was cold. On top of that, here is the reason for my 2 star rating - THERE WAS ONLY 3 PIECES OF MEAT! Bro, you are not a fancy Michelin star restaurant. You sell SOUL FOOD. Soul food is typically a hugeass plate of fried chicken, potatoes and sides. This was legit 3 pieces of meat for $15. And its not even the best I've ever had. Can't justify this. I've definitely had better Kare-Kare in Toronto."}
{"text":"My friends and I did an 8 hour trip from New Jersey for Platitos. There was 15 of us in one van. I emailed Derek to make sure we were able to try everything ube so we don't waste a drive. He was very responsive and was able to sit us in right away when we arrived. The service was great, Trisha and Shayda? was awesome. We were able to try the ube waffles, ube cheesecake, sisig fries, and everything else in the menu! The calamansi juice was the best. The food was definitely FFilipino soul food. We also got a complimentary ube parfait which was very delicious!! Thank you to the owners of John & Derek for accommodating all of us and providing the best service! Visit NY/NJ soon so we can tour you guys around!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. Surprisingly I really enjoyed it. I had the Longislog, I'm a huge fan of langonesa, it was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the Tapsilog, had a bite and it was okay, strong tangy taste, salty. Then we ordered the bok bok chicken with the ube waffle to share. The chicken was okay but omg the waffle!! So soft and creamy with the side butter concoction and maple syrup I loved it and ate most of it! Will def come back again"}
{"text":"This place is SO overrated and overpriced. My friend and I came here to check it out (we're visiting from Vancouver) but were disappointed. Food was okay, nothing exceptional, nothing special. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, spent $40+ and left hungry. We ordered the sizzling pork and the beef stew with coconut milk. The pork was actually pork skin, but the menu didn't mention that so we were expecting pork meat. Instead we got a tiny portion of super oily pork skin with an egg. I usually do like pork crackling when it's done right, but this thing was like an oil soup. The beef stew was mediocre, the portion was small. I get that they're tapas, but $15? For that quality? Uhmm.. No.

Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try a casual Filipino joint in Toronto besides Lamesa. Platito occupies a wonderful spot on the baldwin strip, with a great patio to enjoy the summer.

I came here for lunch with some coworkers - we didn't make reservations which was fine but the patio did fill up as lunch time went on. Their lunch menu is small with basic Filipino dishes like bbq pork skewers, pancit, and lechon. All items come with a rice. 

I got the bbq pork skewers - which end up being two small (6 inches) skewers on top of white rice with some pickled onions. The portion was definitely very small, and I was still hungry after. The pork was sweet, and well cooked, but not amazing. 

I have had the pleasure of eating a lot of Filipino food over the past few years and I was left a little disappointed with Platito. I will come back though to try their brunch, but I do hope they are able to put a little bit more love and care into the food. After all I have never left a Filipino lunch feeling hungry!!"}
{"text":"Wow! So many negative reviews on Yelp. I wonder why..

Platito is one of the precious gems on Baldwin serving really good Filipino cuisine. I've been here TWICE and both times I had great service and a really good time. Both times I was seated on a patio on a nice spring day and the vibe is truly amazing and the food is truly delicious. There's nothing to complain about this place, really. 

Today for brunch, I got the bangsilog. My friend got the bok bok chicken & ube waffles. I tried his waffle (I love ube ice cream and ube flavored everything) and it had a really subtle taste of ube. I wouldn't really recommend that dish because my friend didn't seem to be loving the dish as much as I loved mine. For 12 dollars, my plate was packed! I got a huge fish, two delicious eggs and my one of my favorite foods in the world, GARLIC FRIED RICE. The fish was cooked nicely, my eggs were runny, and I LOVE GARLIC FRIED RICE. I thought I would get a really tiny portion, but it was fine. It was great. I loved it! I'm not a fan of the pickled sides (refer to picture), but the overall dish was great and I savoured every single bite! 

I will always have positive memories and thoughts about this restaurant. 

TLDR; Great atmosphere, great food, but maybe don't get the bok bok chicken & ube waffles. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My experience was very pleasant and friendly. It seemed that at the time my girl and I came to platito that all tables were taken up while me and 2 other parties were waiting. They allowed us to eat in their party room in the back

The food was actually really good in my opinion, we had the Lechon Kawali as an appetizer and Chicken Inisal with rice. Although portion was small, it tasted very good to put it simply

Now for the real reason me and my girl came, the dessert. We got the Ube shake which was very creamy and light, not too sweet and tasted of the Oh so goodness of ube, I recommend getting this.
Also, we ordered the ube waffle with ube icecream topped with macopuno (coconut). We really enjoyed the dessert with the textures of the ube waffle and the ice cream as it went very well together and would recommend this as well

Reason why for the 4 stars is because of the wait time for the waffle and our cheque. But overall great experience and would recommend platito"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite new spots! Delicious eats, solid service and a cool vibe all around. The Kare Kare beef was the winner of the night. Stewed beef in a savoury peanut sauce with vegetables is how it's described on the menu, but it would be more apt to say: exquisitely tender beef, rich and perfectly balanced peanut sauce and wonderful complement of charred Shanghai bok choy, green beans and ocra. We also enjoyed the Adobo Fried Pork Chops, Lumpia Shanghai, and Chicken Wings Kare Kare style. All were well portioned and very tasty. Despite being a relatively new spot on the Baldwin strip and being a packed house, the service was very good and we felt taken care of through our meal. With new joints, kinks require working out but we never felt rushed or ignored. The vibe is relaxed and is a great spot for a kick-it-back date night or a raucous group wanting some flavourful eats and some tropical inspired drinks. Slam a couple shots back and celebrate Platito's arrival - the 6ix has found its latest keeper."}
{"text":"Went for their brunch. Had fried chicken and Ube waffle. Was a bit of a disappointment. Waffle was soggy and couldn't really taste the Ube flavour. Not sure to come back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, and the food tasted great. Love the option of either sitting outside or inside. The ube chicken and waffles is a must try for all, will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"The service took so long and they kept forgetting things but the food was good."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I absolutely loved this joint, but because I'm Filipino myself, I had high expectations. I do love ambience and decor in the restaurant which was comforting and modern. I came here with a party of 8 on a Saturday for brunch. 

I ordered the Pares Hilton which was a stewed beef with rice and egg. The marinade had a familiar taste of a star anise dish my family makes, but I can't remember the name! I would've loved the dish if it had the cooking juices in the bowl to have my rice soak in the flavors like Sinigang. I feel like for the price it wasn't as worth it because it can be made for significantly less with more authentic flavors. 

I tried my friend's ube waffle and fried chicken. Overall, it was just okay. Growing up with ube, I was expecting the waffle to have more flavor, but I feel the fried chicken drowned it out. The chicken was okay too. My friend mentioned how one piece was cooked better than the other so it lacked consistency.

The service was great though! I do recommend this place for those who are looking for a modern-westernized take on Filipino food. But, for me personally, I'll stick to my own kitchen haha"}
{"text":"Went as part of a group of 4. Got the tapsilog. Service was really slow and food arrived cold. We couldn't even get the pandisal early."}
{"text":"4.5 for now...
This review is actually long overdue. I actually came here about a month ago on a Tuesday night. Given the day of the week and the quiet neighbourhood, I was surprised to see another table seated. We didn't order much as neither of us were crazy hungry. 
On a street of mainly cafes, dessert joints, and noodle shops, this place stands out, also considering its close proximity to both a university and the Toronto core. 
First impression - wow. Beautiful decor, especially the bird on the wall upstairs. We were greeted by who I believe is the owner and given recommendations since we've never had Filipino food. The menu was short and concise and at first, I was conflicted I've never had this type of cuisine before. I wanted something different, but I also wanted some \"safe\" (i.e. I wouldn't hate myself for paying $16 for mediocre chicken).
After a while, we decided to go with a starter - lechon kawali (fried pork belly) and pork sisig. When the dishes came to our table, we were kind of disappointed by the serving size in relation to the price. However, do keep in mind that it is 1 - quality, and 2 - pure meat, therefore quite filling. We shared a bowl of rice as well. 
I was happy with our choices. At the end of our meal, the serve gave us a complimentary nutella turon, which is like a fried plantain (or banana if you've never had plantain) and nutella. I have to say that this was probably the best \"fried banana\" (I'm so sorry that I'm comparing such a delicious dish to something you can get at AYCE but that's all I got) I've ever had. 

I still have to try their famous ube waffle but at the same time, I'm not that eager to try it as I find that they have other dishes that are just as unique. 
In terms of price, this isn't a place I would go to all the time but it is a place I would take friends."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite tiny and the patio is great in warm weathers.

We ordered the fried pork belly appetizer, the tosilog and the chicken and waffles.
The fried pork belly came in 6 thick pieces with dip. Crunchy and quite fatty - the pickled veggies on top helped counteract the oiliness. It wasn't as tender as I like it to be and it doesn't offer a lot of flavour. 

The tosilog is sweet pork with garlic rice and 2 eggs. I love the sweetness of the pork. Good portion size with authentic flavours!
The chicken and waffles was also good. You can subtly taste the sweet ube flavour in the waffle which is a good balance to the tender fried chicken. 

It's a good place to visit if you want to try some filipino comfort food but overall the food lacked some flavours"}
{"text":"It's nice to finally see filipino restaurants finally popping up this summer. This place serves the classics often with a modern twist. It's refreshing to see finally a different style of food that Toronto rarely gets to see. 

I had the tapsilog and pandesal, which are both great, almost as good as eating it right in the Philippines. 

It's so different and interesting that it demands multiple visits. If you are  new to filipino food there is no better place in Toronto(unless you get home cooking from a friend)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's so rare to find a vegetarian option at a Filipino restaurant, but the Pancit Bohol and Veggie Lumpia was super tasty!"}
{"text":"At the end of the night, Marvin ordered the Waffle and Ice Cream Macapuno (macapuno is Kopyor coconut) for dessert. I took a couple of bites from him and really enjoyed this! The ube (yam) waffles were extremely soft and mushy. They mixed very well with the ube ice cream! Yum! I can see why their ube waffles are such a hit now. If only they had their infamous fried chicken and waffles dish in stock that night."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE HYPE - 1 1/2 stars. 

My expectations for Platito were extremely high, considering the popularity of this place on social media. I so badly wanted to like this place but was left extremely underwhelmed and disappointed. 

My friend and I, came here on a Friday night. There were no host or servers to greet us, there was just a random sign outside the restaurant saying to \"Please Wait To Be Seated\". We were a little confused as to why the sign was outside of the restaurant and not inside. My friend and I were waiting on the side walk awkwardly while people on the patio were staring at us as well. We decided to just walk into the restaurant and still no one came to greet us or tell us where to go until I had to flag one of the staff down and asked to be seated. 
We were taken upstairs to a really hot room. I immediately noticed how uncomfortable the chairs were and how sticky our table was.  

When it came to order initially, we wanted to order the Chicken Inasal however; the server told us they ran out of chicken *DING!* - bad sign already. I mean how do you run out of chicken at 8pm on a Friday night?

So we ordered the Pork Sisig and the Adobo Fried Pork Chop. Both these dishes we did not enjoy at all. They looked great however; the dishes were extremely bland and dry. Did I mention they were $15 each? Anddddd - I had to season them myself.

To make things worse, the music kept skipping and at one point stopped all together. My friend and awkwardly sat in silence with another couple in the room. 

Overall, my experience at Platito was not a pleasant one. I am disheartened I had to write such a negative review especially when I was rooting for this place."}
{"text":"We wanted to try some different asian cuisine and decided to come to this new Filipino joint on Baldwin. We tried a nice variety of dishes and their unique ice cream dessert!

The entrees provided a great new flavour unique to Filipino food. We tried the kare kare (beef stew) and the adobo pork. Both had a fantastic savoury flavour and was presented very nicely. After the main course, we tried the ice cream and waffles everyone was talking about. The only problem was that we had to wait over 30 minutes to get what we ordered... It was too bad that happened, but overall it was an okay experience for something a little different."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place with my boyfriend and made a res. But there were 2 things about this place that it deserves only 2 stars: Food and service

I remember a previous review warned of a long wait, but I totally disregarded it. Little did I know, I would sit there for an hour and half approximately to get 2 dishes, that by the way according to my boyfriend, \"nothing special and mediocre\" and doesn't take long to make. We ordered the Pares Hilton and the Tapsilog. The tapsilog was beef but it was chewy and hard to eat. Mine was delicious, but I am 95% sure I deemed it tasty because I was starving from waiting so long.

I think there was only one waitress on the floor serving tables on the inside and the patio because I didn't see anyone else. She would take a long time with the water, even getting the menus to start with, and bringing the bill. It was a painfully long wait for everything in general so I didn't bother ordering dessert.

This place gets a lot of traffic regardless because of the trendy Baldwin neighborhood. But just a word of advice, either come on a random day at non rush hour, or prepare to wait forever for your food. By the time my boyfriend and I got our food, it was too dark to take a  picture. I won't be coming back and there's plenty of other Filipino restaurants to try out there."}
{"text":"Checked out this place on a Friday night with our friend who was craving Filipino food.   Restaurant is spread out over 2 floors and we were seated on the main floor which had a few small tables. Our server didn't come around for a good 10 minutes so we finally had to wave someone down so we could order. We shared 3 starters and 3 entrees between the 4 of us. We had  the sisig fries, pork belly and shrimp fritters to start. All were underwhelming. Fries weren't crispy, pork belly under flavoured and shrimp fritters had no trace or taste of shrimp. The entrees were better, with the Kare kare stewed beef as the group fav. Enjoyed the 90s hip hop that was playing all night but food and service was ok only."}
{"text":"I'll be honest in saying that the pictures of the fried chicken and purple ube waffles are what gravitated me to Platito. When it came time to suggest places for brunch, I quickly sold my friends on Platito.

Fortunately, they take reservations so there was no unnecessary 30-45 minute wait which seems to be a given for most brunch joints on the weekend. We made reservations for 11:30 but judging from the availability in seating on the main floor, upstairs, and on patio, it didn't seem necessary. Though it did pick up later, as we finished our meals.

Two of the three of us arrived early, so we started with some drinks while we waited for our third friend. I settled for the Calamansi Shandy which had its distinct sweet and sour (and refreshing) taste, while my friend got the Boracay Mango Shake and added rum for an extra $3. After having a sip of the mango shake, I wish I had ordered that instead; fresh, sweet mangoes with a BIG shot of rum!

Once our friend arrived, we split the Bok Bok Chicken & Ube Waffles ($16) and the Tosilog ($13). It was an interesting take on the Southern classic. The waffle was pretty soft and lacked the ube flavour that I've grown up with. The fried chicken was crispy and tender though. The Tosilog stayed true to its traditional roots; garlic fried rice with runny eggs. The pork wasn't too sweet, which the packaged tosino tends to be. There was a bit of waffle and rice leftover since the waffle was quite big and it was a reasonable portion of rice. Unless of course, my friends took a bigger share of the meat!

For dessert, we had to get the Waffle & Ice Cream Macapuno ($7). It was perfect for sharing, and unlike the chicken and waffles, we managed to finished the entire waffle as the scoop of ube ice cream was HUGE. The combination of the ube ice cream and coconut strings with the ube waffle was a nice, sweet ending.

Overall, a decent and filling brunch. It's nice to see more Filipino restaurants opening up and I'd come back during a weeknight to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Food: had the lechon kiwali (pork belly) and bok bok and Ube waffle. The pork belly was delicious 5/5. Crispy and the flavour was well balanced with the pickled veg that came with it. 
The chicken and waffle was a 4/5. I've wanted to try it for a long time and the waffle was not as flavourful as I had expected but the maple butter was delicious. 
Service: 5/5 our server was amazing and that really made the experience excellent. She was great with recommendations and always checking in."}
{"text":"Reservations recommended! Although I was able to walk in on a Saturday evening with a group of 4 without having to wait even though they told us they were fully booked for the night. 

The menu has great selection of Filipino dishes, but I opted only to get the ube waffle dessert. To be honest, the ice cream was icy and the waffle wasn't anything outstanding. It was very decadent and I would recommend sharing it with someone if you plan on getting it. 

I'll definitely have to try their savoury options, but for now there are other Filipino restaurants that I prefer over Platito in the city."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Thankfully they weren't too busy when we arrived.  We were seated right away on the patio.  They also have plenty of indoor seating.  I noticed this when I went inside to use the washroom, which was pretty clean. However, no hooks anywhere to hang your purse or coat (if you had one).  We were seated right away but quickly forgotten because no one thought to bring us menus until we had to flag someone down for some.

My girlfriends ordered the calamansi juice and the Palawan Jungle Juice.  Both were very refreshing.  The calamansi juice was so cooling and tasty.  There is rum in the jungle juice, but you could barely taste it.  Those kind of drinks are dangerous lol.

Our food took about 20 minutes to come out, which we really noticed because we were starving.  I ordered the longsilog and my girlfriends ordered the tapsilog and the bok bok chicken and ube waffles.  I was really disappointed when I asked for tomatoes on the side to go with my longonisa and they said they didn't have any.  How can you have longonisa without tomatoes? It's just a true Filipino combo.  I can never have longonisa without tomatoes at home and if you check my review on Kravings, I talk about this there too lol.  They did offer me banana ketchup, but declined, as it's just not the same.  My dish was okay, nothing too special but it was good.  The longonisa was definitely made in house as they had chunks of garlic within the sausage.  The rice was good and they cooked my egg just as I requested. I think I couldn't fully enjoy my meal because a kid beside us threw up.  I don't do well with that kind of stuff.  Thankfully it was outside.  I can't really blame the establishment for this, but I still couldn't enjoy my meal.  I tried some of the tapsilog and it was pretty good.  Very flavourful but my girlfriend's dad can make the rice and tapsilog just as good.  I had to try some of the ube waffle.  It gives off a fragrant taste when you first start eating but I think you get use to it.  It was very soft and fluffy.  It was like an ube cake just shaped in a waffle lol, it SO fluffy.  My friend devoured her chicken and waffles.  

The pricing is great for the amount of food you get.  Our waitress was very friendly and even apologized for the kid throwing up (which again, wasn't their fault).  She expressed she was concerned as we were sitting right next to him.  I have another friend that wants to try this place out, so I'd probably return to try some of their pulutan or a main dish."}
{"text":"Bicol express is ridiculously dry....... you can't barely taste the coconut.
Kare-Kare is rather blunt. 
My friends who ordered Chicken INASAL and PANCIT Bihon seem to be okay with their food. 
super slow.... like min 1 hour wait.
don't sit on the second floor. very noisy, you can barely hear each other
Lunch menu is very limited
Waitress/kitchen messed up our order........

will mostly not come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing introduction to Filipino food. Really great service and a cool looking restaurant. Can't wait to sit on the patio this summer!"}
{"text":"It was sooooooo gooood! Trish provided great service. She was very attentive and quick. I ate some spicy beef thing that really good. I had a delicious calamansi cocktail it was a bit sweet but it smelled wonderful."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for weekday lunch. We were seated upstairs which was nice in terms of privacy but it got a pretty warm once we started eating our spicy food. Those fans didn't do much to help the situation.  

Service was friendly and attentive but make sure you come earlier if you're in a rush so you can beat the crowds. 

Food is tasty and well portioned (not too small, not huge either). There's a kick to most of the dishes so make sure you ask beforehand if you're sensitive to spice. Very manageable for diners new to Filipino food-- if anything it's maybe not adventurous enough! 

I had the Kare Kare for $15 which consisted of stewed beef accompanied by fried eggplant, long beans, bok choy and crunchy fried okra, topped with a coconut curry sauce. The beef was  tender, the vegetables were very well executed and the sauce delicious! They provided various sauces for the table for you to customize your meal as desired.

The other dishes served at my table looked good but not particularly unique. E.g. Grilled chicken on rice, BBQ pork belly with crispy skin on rice, beef curry on rice, etc. Still everyone enjoyed their meal and we all had a great time.

The ube waffle with ice cream was an amazing end to the meal!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, long wait, super uncomfortable seats and a little pricey for Filipino food"}
{"text":"I know...I'm late to the party but finally got the chance to try Platito. Hubby and I walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night and were seated at communal picnic table in the back. I really enjoyed the old school R&B they were playing, at least until they had to temporarily move the sound system to the front part of the restaurant. 

We ordered adobo fried pork chop, pork skewers, and kare kare. The kare kare was good, with just enough salted shrimp fry saltiness to not need extra bagoong on the side. The kare kare was not made with oxtail (which I'm accustomed to having in kare kare) but the beef was tender and the sauce was tasty. I did enjoy the textural interest that the fried okra provided. 

Pork skewers were saucy and sweet the way I like it, and the meat was juicy with lots of delicious garlic and onion flavour. My hubby wasn't fond of the fattier pieces of meat on the skewer he ate but generally speaking I found the meat to fat ratio on the skewers better than most Filipino restaurants. 

 The pork chops were perfectly fried and the sauce was delicious but I enjoyed the atchara (like a Filipino sauerkraut) that helped cut the heaviness of the fried pork. Unfortunately one of the pork chops had a massive section of fat that made up about a third the portion of one of the chops. I did mention this to one of the owners who stated that this is not the norm and he offered to have the chef fry up another chop for us.  We declined because we were already quite full. Yet not full enough to pass up something sweet. The turon was yummy with the addition of Nutella and strawberry sauce and served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. A delicious, not too sweet little dessert to finish off an overall satisfying meal.

Overall the food was quite tasty and I hope to return to try some of their more novel dishes like bok bok chicken with ube waffle. If you're coming in the colder months, you may wish to make a reservation so you can be seated in the restaurant proper to avoid getting cool feet if seated in the enclosed back patio section of the restaurant. 

Hope these guys do well! I think it's pretty awesome that a nurse and architect are the owners of this restaurant, as it's always great to see Filipino cuisine being elevated and made more accessible to the masses."}
{"text":"Hosted my birthday party here with 20+ guests and was not super impressed by the food or value. The space is not large, so if inviting large groups like I did, make sure to make a reservation at least a couple of days in advance. There is patio seating in the warmer months, but during the cooler months seating does get very limited due to loss of the patio space. 

Food- 3/5. It wasn't bad, but also wasn't like, wow! Maybe my expectations were too high since Platito and Filipino food in general has been getting so much hype. Definitely NOT very vegetarian or vegan friendly here for dinner at least. There are vegetarian options, but most of the (best) dishes feature lots of red meat, chicken, and eggs. As a vegetarian you're pretty much down to dessert dishes like the Ube waffle + ice cream. Although I noticed that they've added more plant- and seafood-based dishes recently. Back then I still ate chicken, so ordered the chicken inasal (grilled chicken). The dish was very simple, basically just a large piece of chicken and I was a little paranoid about the charred black bits on the chicken skin (carcinogenic???), so picked those off leaving me with not much flavor to savor. You have to purchase carbs (rice) separately as entrees do not come with rice.

Value- 2/5. All the dinner entrees are $10+, but I feel that for what you get, it's not really worth the bucks... Even the signature Ube waffle dessert is over $10 :( Hope your crew likes to share.

Service- 3/5. Slow, but totally understandable since my crowd was large. Overall we were forgotten about upstairs with regards to water refills and billing. But gotta give it to them for accommodating so many mouths and even extras that showed up later.

Probably won't be back until I have more cash in my wallet. Jk I'll be back in the near future to try the brunch or veggie options :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We tried the bok bok chicken and ube waffles as well as the ube waffles and ice cream. Both takes on the ube waffles were really good! We were extremely full after both dishes! I am looking forward to coming back to Platito's again!"}
{"text":"So far I've visited around 3-4 filipino locations in Toronto and I would say this is a great mix of all of them combined. 

First off, I love the design and spacing of the restaurant. I hate that restaurants nowadays pretty much force customers side by side. The authentic flavors are bountiful and (best of all) very affordable! For anyone thinking Lamesa is too expensive for constant filipino cravings, I'm sure this will more than suffice. 

I have no complaints since they are very detailed to what they serve (I love their wooden plates! Really reminds me of beach food in pinas) and their ube waffle is a must! Super fluffy and soft. 

It is a little difficult to get to considering where I'm located but for sure when I'm around the area, I'll definitely be visiting again =D"}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly staff.. A little disorganized, but understandable as it was a soft opening. Bicol Express was our favourite. 

Will return when  it officially opens for another try."}
{"text":"Ang Sarap!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Great staff. Owner Derek very friendly and welcoming.  The Lumpia Shanghai was very good and also enjoyed the Ukoy as appys.  I had the Bok Bok Chicken and Ube Waffles.   Chicken was moist and tender and the waffle was tasty.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing Filipino Soul Food.  Finally a real good real authentic Filipino food in downtown.  Baldwin Street,  please welcome a huge success in Platito.  Food was great,  people were great,  atmosphere is so family oriented.  They will take care of you there,  you won't be dissatisfied.  Make sure you get the UBE Waffles and Chicken!"}
{"text":"I ate at Platito for the first time on a Friday night, with reservations for 4 people at 8:30pm. Note for next time (and for others): be sure to ask for the patio. We were seated upstairs and it was very hard to have a conversation because all of the noise (from other tables) echoed, and because of this, people tended to speak louder than normal to hold and hear their own conversations.

We waited over one hour for our food. One hour! Granted, unlike others who have left the same comment, our food was still warm.

We ordered the Pork Sisig, Bicol Express, and Kare-Kare as mains. As an appetizer (smaller plates), we ordered the Lumpia Shanghai which came out at the same time as the other food. None of it comes with rice, so it was an additional $2 per bowl (personal size). For drinks, I ordered the calamansi juice (too sweet / sugary) and the rest of the table ordered San Miguels. I am Filipina and know what authentic Filipino food tastes like. This place was actually very good! In terms of pricing, it was very expensive - as an example, the Kare-Kare dish was $16, and only came with 4 pieces of meat (one per person). Not enough!

I would not come back here- solely because I don't think you get good value for your money, and also, the wait time was way too long! Hopefully once they are a little more established, things will be quicker."}
{"text":"Hostess is extremely rude and has an attitude problem. I asked her for water since our server forgot to bring ours. When she brings our waters she goes, \"In the future, I'm not your server so any requests must go to her.\" I then said, \"Our server didn't bring the water when I asked her awhile ago.\" Her response, \"Oh well. I didn't know that\" and walked off. Ruined me and my guests mood completely. Food is okay. Wish they didn't fry the shrimp with the shell on it, making it weird and difficult to eat."}
{"text":"Pros 
The kare kare was really good and so were the pork lumpias. 
The 2 cocktails were very good along with the San Miguel beer
The server we got was also superb

Cons 
The lechon kawali was not fresh, it was bland, dry and too thick. 
The pork sisig was super bland even though there were hot peppers. 
If u don't make reservations you're waiting in line for an hour because of the small space
The lineup was very disorganized there should be someone at the front at all times



Overall,
Not to my expectations, food was not amazing I've had better sisig at kabalen on Bathurst and Wilson.
The drinks were amazing I'd probably go there for dessert and drinks next time"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was terrible. We had to ask for a side of rice at least 5x. The food came out in some weird order and it took almost an hour for the mains to come out. We were pretty sure they forgot about it. We sat down at 7:30, and we left at 10. We didn't have dessert. No one seemed to acknowledge how long we had been sitting there without food or drinks. The server forgot my friend's drink and we had to ask another server for it, and it still didn't arrive. We even ran out of water, and finally I took it upon myself to just walk to an unattended bar to grab a bottle of freshly filled water. The water bottles were filled, but we were left ignored forever. It was a random Tuesday night, and they didn't seem that busy. 
Don't get me wrong, they were all perfectly nice, and they've only been open for 6 weeks we were told, but they need a lot of work as far getting their service flow in order."}
{"text":"I only had ube waffle and ice cream. Ube cheese cake was sold out. 
Cafe was pretty busy, staffs are  friendly.
My waffle has nothing on other than ice cream. no syrup and nothing.
Just purple colour waffle without any maple syrup.
I can't hardly taste ube. Ice cream was ok... it's over priced for what I got. 
 I wouldn't recommend for here for dessert. Media was overrated. And if they have syrup to go with this waffle, they should serve together, after I saw other people's reviews it's not only me who has complained about dry flavour ube waffle."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8.00 pm but were seated around 8.40 pm as the present patrons hadn't yet left. It was frustrating to wait that long despite having a reservation. Additionally, we waited for around forty minutes for our food.

For drinks, we had the Boracay mango shake with rum as well as a mix of calamansi and tequila. Unfortunately, the rum overpowered the mango shake and the calamansi drink was not mixed well.

Food-wise, the one dish I really enjoyed was the kare-kare (you should be warned that it's really spicy). The other dishes were alright in my opinion.

It's a new restaurant so I'm sure they're still getting their house in order. It has an excellent and fun ambience. Nevertheless, with some improvements in maintaining reservations, labeling spicy foods as such (since people are often surprised by how spicy it is), and making sure their service is more efficient, it'll be a bigger success story."}
{"text":"Hottest and new restaurant by Baldwin Village - blogTO

Coming out as a local yelp reviewer, this new 'FILIPINO SOUL FOOD' joint is a must to come thru. You will not be let down. 

Came in today with a friend to try it out and i must say that the food was on point. Loved the sisig, as it was very crunchy and not like the ones you order from Max Manila..soggy.

Honestly, although this is a new restaurant and people are giving mix feelings about their service and food, or how Lamesa are better. Give them a break and just try it out. 

Ps. Get the sisig and the ube waffles. Yes, ube waffles. Very delicious, i wonder if the chef who created it is delicious too."}
{"text":"Good Filipino soul food.  (Not as good as my mom's but nothing is! Lol).  There were a lot of traditional Filipino dishes on the menu.  

The owner was really friendly and accommodating when I stopped by with a couple of friends late on a weekday.  It was beautiful outside and they set up some seats on the small front patio for us.

The portion sizes were good, as were the prices.  

I would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends on a beautiful day on the patio. Food was delicious. Drinks were good. Service pretty good. Would like to come back soon"}
{"text":"Need to really improve the service. Have been here 3 times and have tried both dinner and brunch menus. Subpar service meant long wait for dishes, some members of party not getting their food for a long time, frantic waving to get any server attention and some dishes are not served hot anymore or rice comes out delayed  (a no-no for a Filipino meal). So why 3 stars? Good taste and value for a downtown meal. Their interpretation of Kare Kare (beef), Chicken Inasal, and Pares and Tapsilog for brunch were good. The ube waffle looked nice but needs more ube taste. The chicken with the waffle was crispy enough. Drinks were ok. 
Please really improve your service since it's a major turnoff which is a shame considering what you are trying offer in your menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner last Wednesday at Platito. I would recommend making a reservation as it's a small restaurant and with the buzz that it has been receiving from various news outlet,  you don't want to be left without a table. We ordered the pork spring rolls and lechon to start. Everything was flavored, had a golden brown crust and seasoned. They even had small garlic chips on top of the spring rolls which really brought out the garlic flavor. I then ordered their ube waffles and fried chicken. It came with maple syrup and butter which was mixed with something. I wasn't too sure. The waffle was soggy but the chicken was crispy,  seasoned and tasted great. The have a good drink selection included local ciders,  a few wines and San Miguel of course. The service was prompt and really welcoming. Overall an affordable and delicious meal in a beautiful space."}
{"text":"Excellent! I've been longing for someone to create a Filipino restaurant that is more than just a mom and pop shop and this hits the nail right on the head! Platito turns dishes I ate growing up into classy cuisine. The Ube Waffles and Ube Cheesecake were especially delicious. If you're in Toronto, I'd definitely make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Came to try out this new place in Baldwin.  After seeing all the mouth watering photos on Instagra6, I know I had to try it.
First of all the location - they couldn't have chosen a better one. Baldwin is a foodies' haven. With all the good restaurants in the area, they are bound to be noticed.
Foodwise, this place has a lot of potential.  The food is good, decent servings (even for someone like that eats tons of rice ), very nice presentation. Menu is not that extensive, which is great, that means they pretty much feature the Filipino favourites. The only disadvantage I see, is that Filipinos who would try their dishes would expect the taste of typical Filipino food.  What can I say, we Pinoys are generally unforgiving when it comes to our food.
Longsilog- for those who don't know, is a breakfast staple - fried rice, sausages and fried egg. Their longganisa (sausages) are made in house and it was delicious. It has the perfect combination of sweetness and spice.
Beef pares was drier than I expected.  I'm used to the dish having more sauce and a stronger flavour from star anise. The egg on top was a good addition to the dish. 
The sisig was good although not as crunchy as I would want it.
I really think this place has the potential to really do well, considering the other Filipino restaurant competitor is way too pricey for what they give.
Maybe introducing special dishes every month would be good so that customers won't get tired of the same menu. 
I will definitely be back to try other dishes and will update this review then."}
{"text":"Third time trying to eat here. For some reason they are closed for some reason it another. First things first they have a conditional pass on their public health sign which is a concern. Secondly, they only serve brunch menu on weekends. This doesn't make sense. Brunch menu is so plain. We ended up having a brunch meal for dinner! Next thing is the service. The first time we went we didn't get in because we were an 5 mins late on their list call. When we ate there it took them half an hour to serve us basic brunch food. Then there was the food. My plate was so oily from the tapsilog that it did not make it appetising, the garlic was not fresh in the fried rice and my wife's ube chicken and waffles did not have any ube taste and bland. So disappointing. I expect this place to have an expiry. For a place to claim they serve Filipino soul food I definitely can't feel the soul."}
{"text":"Great food, glad to see the people from everywhere come to enjoy Filipino cuisine. I enjoyed every visit, sorry to hear about the fire. Hope you guys recover soon, would love to visit again."}
{"text":"This is my first Filipino restaurant experience and I was not disappointed. We got the tosilog and tapsilog for brunch. The menu is very limited, most of the items were garlic rice, salad, 2 sunny side eggs and a meat. The sweet pork was marinated really nicely and paired well with the rice. The marinated beef had a similar taste to the Korean bulgogi dish. While I wish there were more options for brunch, the two dishes were very filling. I didn't get to try some of their popular ube items because I think they're only available for dinner. 

The staff is great and the music is popping. Great place for a brunch date. I made reservations online but when I was there there was no wait for small parties."}
{"text":"We arrived very hungry last Friday night and were seated on the patio right away (thanks to our reservation- bonus). It didn't appear overtly busy at the time (around 7pm) but a line up grew about an hour later. 

Service started off decent. Our order was taken promptly. We ordered the Chicken Inasal, the Lumpia (meat spring rolls), and the Adobo Pork chop. 

Our food took over half an hour to get to us after placing our order, and was not worth the wait. Having been to Lamesa a couple times I was consciously comparing the two, and Platito just didn't cut it for me. 

The spring rolls were tasty but nothing memorable. The chicken was overcooked and resembled something I could have made at home. The pork chop felt very heavy and greasy, and was hard to cut through. 

We didn't bother ordering the $15 dessert after how underwhelming the meal was. I can't decide whether the slow service or the actual food was the downfall of this experience for me, but Platito has a lot of improvement to work on."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I really like that there's a filipino place near work now.

The portion sizes here are reasonably large. At least for the main. The size of the appetizers are just right. The food tastes pretty good here. I really like the spring rolls!

The first time I was here, I walked away thinking, that was pretty good. The second time I came here, I thought it was OK. I felt the rendering of the meat (pork belly) was a little tough (actually a lot tough), so I didn't eat half of it and had to spit out a portion of it that I couldn't actually chew and swallow. What I could eat, I thought was good. 

So why didn't I just cut the meat and avoid this problem. Interestingly, we didn't have knives at the table. Most everyone at the table had something that required a knife, but I guess it was assumed that dishes were cooked in a way that wouldn't require cutting? Then when I got a knife, it wasn't sharp enough to cut meat. I ended up giving up.

I do like Filipino food enough that I'll come back again."}
{"text":"We went here and the food was good quality.  Think of dishes that are served at Max's Restaurant, and then envision it as much better quality.  That's what you have here, and nice ambiance too.  A place that you would want to return!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I really didn't know what to expect but I loved everything we ordered - see below:

Kare-Kare - Beef
Pork Sisig - Pork
Ginataang Hipon - Shrimp
Biko - Sweet sticky rice + coconut mango cream + coconut milk curds

I will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 4 for their all day Sunday brunch. Note that weekends only serve brunch, they serve the regular menu Monday-Friday only. We ordered the

+Longsilog (made in house sweet pork sausage)
+Tosilog (sweet pork)
+Tapsilog (marinated beef)
+Pares Hilton (stewed beef)

It's really fun to say. The bases for all of these was garlic fried rice and two fried eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly and oozed out when you cut through it. The flavour of the garlic fried rice was yummy. The only difference with our meals was the meat The Pares Hilton (pronounced perez hilton, not paris hilton like we originally thought) was my favourite. the stewed beef was soft and tender. It is the same meat they use for the Kare-Kare, a traditional staple food in the Philippines that is served in their weekday menu. 

The food presentation was picture worthy. I'm only giving it 3 stars because although delicious, the food was expensive for its simplicity. In addition, the service was slower than I would have liked as it took the kind server awhile to come by our table. It had rained the day before and the benches weren't wiped down properly that morning so one of us looked like we wet ourselves."}
{"text":"We ordered Kare-Kare and another entree containing beef and coconut, which I forgot the name. My friend and I both agreed the taste of them are just the most awful of all the foods we have had in many years. From the menu you may feel it's quite normal, cuz it's just coconut sauce+beef and peanut sauce + beef, both shouldn't be too bad according to our experience in Thai restaurants or Indonesian restaurants. But it's really not... they add something like salty fish sauce in it which makes it just taste so weird. Both of us didn't finish the foods. And when we were leaving, we heard the next table also saying the foods taste so bad... I will never come again... and it leaves me some really bad impression on filipino restaurant. But i hope it's not the authentic filipino one."}
{"text":"COST:
~$10 (Tapsilog)
~$5 (Lechon Kawali)
~$10 (Pork Sisig)
~$3 (San Miguel Beer)

Now THIS is what I call authentic Filipino food. Located in the heart of Baldwin Village, I'm so glad they have this place to represent my good old country. They've only been opened a few weeks when I visited, but you couldn't even tell since they're running like a well oiled machine.

The tapsilog is basically traditional Filipino breakfast served with beef, eggs, fried rice and some pickled veggies. It was good and it hit the spot. Nothing fancy, it's just done right.

The lechon kawali was great as well but the pork sisig truly was delicious. It was so flavorful and delicious! We topped our meals off with good old San Miguel Beer which is a pale pilsen. 

Most definitely a must try spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was legit!!! Hubs and I couldn't want to try em out and they defiantly didn't disappoint. We are from the states and this would be our first time trying out Filipino food. 
Music was everything, we vibed the entire time. Felt like we were back in the 90's early 2000's. All the food was tasty!! My favorite thing I ate was the appetizer and I didn't get a chance to capture it. We had the PORK SISIG my my my, had I known it was that good I wouldn't have spoiled not choosing it for my main course. The KARE KARE was good, I wouldn't have liked to have less of the sauce. Other than that I'd eat it again. Our waiter was a sweetie, I do think next time they should have more help. She managed and we were very pleased with her service. Sad I forgot her name."}
{"text":"Service is horribly slow. I did not like the ube waffle and fried chicken I order; it was bland. I was expecting ube flavour in the waffle but it seems like it's just a waffle with added purple food coloring just to say it's made with purple yam! Not to mention  it took them 30 minutes to get me coffee!"}
{"text":"so I have been seeing this place pop up all over my instagram and my facebook, and being Filipino I was most definitely intrigued, anytime I see a new Filipino restaurant come up I am always super excited for it.

my friend and I decided to try this place out last night. we had two choices, here or another Filipino restaurant close by. we chose this place due the recent trend on our instagram pages with the ube (purple yam) waffles, which btw we did not order, none-the-less we went here since it new. 

it was pretty late as we went after work at around 8ish, and the patio was packed(good sign so far). we decided to sit inside since it was dark out, and we didn't want to wait for a patio seat. Upon entry to the restaurant the cute wall designs and hipster feel of this restaurant really had me even more excited. The inside tables were up some stairs, and here is where I found out why everyone was sitting on the patio. The indoor seating was tight, only had two windows so if your claustrophobic, I suggest you wait to sit on the patio. although the ceilings were high, the place felt small and hot (they counteracted the heat with a fan). our table for 2 was small and cute and the center piece and drink menu were cute additions to the look of the restaurant, however the chairs were pretty uncomfortable *thumbs down* 

They played music using spotify, which is not an issue or a negative in any way, its just at points in the night the music cut off. It was me and my friend and a couple left for the night, so the atmosphere got really, really quiet.(I am sure the couple that was seated like 6 ft away could hear me chew, and I like to think I am a quiet chewer). How do I know it was spotify you may ask, well I have the app, and the commercials is the dead give away.

The waitress was super friendly, and super sweet, however she asked us what we wanted to drink and only brought out my drink. when we requested again for my friends drink, she did apologize that she forgot, great accountability her end to apologize for her error. 

now for the food, in my all honest opinion, lacked flavour. Now, I know this restaurant had a modern spin on the Filipino culture and it's food, however I must say the food I had was on the bland/dry side. the Lechon kawali I had for starters was good for the crispiness at the top, however it was very dry and serve with a lechon sauce called mang Thomas which was had a thick consistency. I also order the pork adobo(second choice, my first choice was sold out), I loved the presentation and the way it looked, but again lacked in flavour. 

my friend order the pork sisig - I had a little taste, it was okay, but it also bland. my friend asked the waitress for salt and pepper shakers however they did not have, but the accommodated by giving us salt and pepper in ramekins.

overall, I do not think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but I left underwhelmed. When my sister and I stumbled upon Platito while walking through Baldwin Village, we were excited to have the chance to eat Filipino food while visiting TO. 

Upon entering, you'll find the walls painted with colorful rooster and jeepney murals (if I remember correctly). We were seated upstairs, and expect to be elbow to elbow with your table next door. It's a tight space. The ambiance is cool, with wooden floors, tables and natural light coming through. There's also outdoor seating. However, there is a bar area downstairs. On the particular night we dined, they were blasting some rap/hip hop, which is fine, but felt out of place with the whole feel of the restaurant.

We ordered lumpia, sisig, and pork bbq with two cups of steamed rice. This is where things went south. There was one waitress managing the whole second floor, and she was super friendly. Unfortunately, it took awhile to get all of our dishes. The sisig came first, and it was our favorite item. It's under the appetizer and dinner menu, so it's a smaller portion, but still flavorful and filling. The lumpia came about 20 minutes later. Yes, five pieces of lumpia took that long. It was crispy and light, and topped with a sweet/sour sauce that tasted house made. Our order of bbq came in another 30 minutes. The dishes are presented so nicely, and of course the bbq looked delicious. Once we bit into it, we found it was not cooked. Not completely raw, but definitely not edible. What a disappointment, after all that waiting. 

At the end, we were full enough from the lumpia and sisig. We almost tried the ube waffle dessert, but passed. Maybe once they get the kinks out of the system, they'll have smoother and more efficient service. Until then, you're probably better off dining at one of the many other options along Baldwin Street or further down on Dundas."}
{"text":"1st time here and it was a pleasant experience, the food was tasty and the service was good. 

Ordered a variety of dishes shared amongst 4 ppl."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed. In theory, the ube chicken and waffles is an excellent concept. But the waffles barely tasted like ube and were quite cakey, less waffle-like texture wise. As for the chicken, it was alright as well. I could taste the seasoning that definitely had hints from spices usually in Filipino dishes but it was a bit too salty for my liking. On the plus side, the chicken was not dry and very juicy. 

Ube Chicken & Waffles: 6.5/10

As for their lumpia, it's almost impossible to mess these up. The sauce was a bit spicy and I didn't like that it doesn't come on the side; they pour the sauce on top of the lumpia. 

Lumpia: 8.5/10

I also had the ube cheesecake which was great! I love the Choconut/polvoron crust. The cheese itself definitely tasted more like ube but still not as much as I expected. Macapuno on top was a yummy addition as well, but I look forward to trying to make this dessert on my own at home. 

Ube Cheesecake: 7.5/10

If you're not used to Filipino food, especially ube, you probably won't be as critical as I am in this review. Platito has an awesome concept but there is definitely room for improvements!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good. Business owner and servers are very nice, helpful and friendly. They seemed a little disorganized at first, but they may be due to lack of experience (or so it seems). Not a biggie, I'm sure they'll hammer things out in no time. The things I wasn't thrill about were lack of A/C on the ground floor inside, super loud music, and prices. Though, the prices are understandable given their rent/location. Personally, I feel like my dollar can stretch further elsewhere. The portions of the \"mains\" are like bigger tapas, but smaller than a typical entree. I would come back if convenient, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Walked by this place and decided to try it out. Don't eat appetiZers here just order another main dish, they are highly underwhelming. We ordered the noodle and the pork dish because the waitress recommended it. I don't know but I just don't like sourness in food.

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"We went here after seeing great advertisements but unfortunately, we were a little disappointed. 

We ordered the sisig and pancit with chicken.

When you walk in, it says to wait to be seated but no one was in sight to bring us to a table. We walked upstairs, same thing, but when we walked back downstairs luckily we ran into a waitress who brought us to our seat. 

The menu is a little expensive. The sisig was $15 and the pancit was $10 + $3 for the chicken. Now, if there were bigger portions it would've been more worth it, however, the portions are super small. It felt overpriced for the amount of food we got. The food itself was pretty good, so it was very disappointing that it was kinda pricey. Also, rice is extra and comes with none of the dishes. (+$2.50) I thought this was odd because it's a Filipino restaurant. We also ordered the ube cheesecake which sounded delicious but the slice was so small!!! It was really good but it was way too tiny to be $6."}
{"text":"I ordered their pork sisig (diced pork in the little pan) and lechon kawali (fried pork belly) because it sounded interesting and delicious to me and when the dishes came out they were nicely presented; I couldn't wait to try them!

But I took a bite of the pork sisig and it was so. Hard. I don't mean \"crunchy\"...it was literally too hard to bite. Now I'm no expert of Filipino soul food, and after googling pork sisig I understand it's the pig's face so I guess there might be some cartilage/bone mixed in. But honestly, I could not even consume the dish because it felt like it was breaking my teeth. I don't think any dish, whether they have cartilage or not, should be THAT hard. 

It was thus the lechon kawali that confirmed that this restaurant seems to make their dishes TOO hard to bite into. Once again I felt like my teeth were gonna chip (though maybe not as much as the pork sisig). Flavour wise, I didn't find it phenomenal; I mostly just tasted \"fried-ness\" but even the fatty pork belly didn't have any of the fatty good flavours. 

I feel no urge to come back to this place."}
{"text":"It's a small place so I would suggest making a reservation. My boyfriend and I decided to visit this place last minute so we had to sit in a communal table and share the table with another party of 2. We ordered the spring roll, Ube Shake, chicken waffles and the pork sisig. The chicken waffle and spring rolls were pretty good. The pork sisig was a little too spicy and bland. If there was rice, it would be better but it's extra. Loved the shake tho!"}
{"text":"i ordered sisig. and i didnt like it because it was hard to chew and not fully cooked. its not the traditional sisig. im disappointed because it cost $15 and it wasnt worth it."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place and finally got a round to trying. It was quite interesting because I've never really been to a philipino restaurant before. 

Pancit Bihon ($10)
Clear rice noodles with pork, adding meat was an extra $2. Came with 3 pieces of pork. It tasted like chinese roasted pork but way more crispier. The rice noodles were really good, really flavorful and had 'wok air'. I liked how it came with a lot of veggie ingredients - cabbage, carrots, etc. I really liked the rice noodles, really tasty!

Bicol Express ($15)
Stewed beef in spicy coconut sauce. The beef was really well braised, the meat was super tender. Surprisingly it was actually quite spicy too. They recommended ordering the dish with a bowl of price since it literally was just meat, which I agree but I felt like there wasn't enough sauce for the rice. 

Ube Icecream & Waffles ($12)
I wasn't sure what ube was, but apparently its purple yam and tastes like taro but less sweet. It was topped with something that was coconut flavor - couldn't remember what it was but it was chewy, not much of my liking. The waffle was freshly made, nice and fluffy so that was good. Huge scoop of icecream which was nice too. It was tasty, a nice way to end dinner."}
{"text":"I got the beef fried rice and it came out lukewarm and beef overly salty. It's one of those dishes that needs to be hot to be yummy. The ube waffle was delicious though so i would recommend getting that."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kare Kare ($16) and spring rolls ($6) to go. Food was tasty but way over priced and portions small.  I don't recommend unfortunately (and I'm filipino)."}
{"text":"First time having Filipino food a while back. The portions were pretty small and the prices were not. The food was pretty good though and the ube dessert was good too.

They're closed right now due to the fire so I can't really go back for a second go."}
{"text":"A Filipino restaurant tucked into the Baldwin street of Toronto. It has 2 small floors of dining space. We were seated upstairs facing a mural wall of a large rooster and school bus. The chairs are small and not that comfy for a petite girl like me. 

I ordered the waffle and fried chicken dish and it was a disappointment for $16. The yam waffle was cold and not crispy at all. At least the chicken was hot. The 4 pieces of chicken had bones and the same size as a chicken wing place. Nothing special about it. The coleslaw was tiny. 

My partner's dish had a small portion to it for lunch so he was definitely still hungry. 

The service was mediocre. The waitress asked as a couple of time if we wanted their sweet buns and we rejected the offer but she still kept on asking. Its not free. 

Verdict: we obviously won't be going back. It was a pricey lunch and the tummy was not satisfied."}
{"text":"A new joint popped up on Baldwin so my friends and I decided to check it out. I've had Filipino food at Lamesa and Casa Manila - which I enjoyed so I was intrigued to see what is joining the options for Filipino food in Toronto. 

We arrived right when it opened and the servers were very friendly and prompt in getting our party of 10 organized on the patio. 

We were given the lunch menu - which is slightly different than the other menus that I've seen on Yelp. I decided on the Kare Kare ($15) myself. The first impression was that the portion of rice is huge while the amount of meat is only moderate. The meat quality that I got was very good - and the sauce had a nice light peanuty taste. I would've enjoyed a stronger peanut taste. There wasn't much sauce also on the rice which is a let down as I was expecting a stew with rice. Most of friends did not finish the rice with their portion of meat - so perhaps it wasn't as well balanced as it could have been. 

My friends ordered the ube waffle with ube ice cream - and I stole a bite. It tasted pretty good - almost like a taro ice cream. I thought the taste of the ice cream was great but the ube waffle was a little too sweet for my liking. 

Overall, it was quite an expensive meal for what I got. I paid $20 after tax and tips for a bowl of rice and some meat. The food was pretty good -I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I would not make a special trip for the food at this price. They're living off the hype of its opening but I doubt they would be able to secure a steady lunch time crowd with the price and its offering. 

18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more. It's okay - the service was good :)"}
{"text":"New restaurant alert.  If you filipino food then this is the spot to go.  

Ube waffles with fried chicken is a must order with their homemade maple butter.  Who a pairing like that could be so delicious. 

Plus the staff is super nice. I accidentally dropped my knife on the ground and it got replaced right away.

I'm coming back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"Growing up having Filipino food it's always interesting visiting a Filipino Resturant comparing the dishes you had as a child to the dishes at the resturant. Overall the food was amazing; the Kare Kare was very rich and full of peanut flavour, the meat was insanely tender. My partner got the adobo porkchop, meat again very tender and well seasoned. On top of that our waiter was on point considering she was dealing with a separate table of 20 guest. I'd highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sadly closed indefinitely due to fire last week at neighbouring, Ryu's Noodle bar. :(

Hope they recover soon!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere-3
Food-2.5
Service-3 friendly but super slow 
Price-pricey for portion.

We ordered 3 out of 4 apps. Very small portions

The stew beef with peanut sauce 4 chunks of beef for $16 and it doesn't come with rice. Rice is extra $2

Pork sisig for $15 was more like and appetizer size.

Overall not really worth the money."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Baldwin Village, my boyfriend and I came by on a Saturday for brunch around 12:30pm. All the inside tables were either taken or reserved so we sat out on the patio in the shade. The restaurant itself has a warm and relaxed vibe and the food reflected the interior/decor.

We ordered the tosilog (sweet pork) and the pares hilton (stewed beef) for food as well as got a sangria (for myself) and the bf got a beer. Dishes were reasonably priced (what you would expect to pay for brunch) and the portions were just right. The standout was the garlic fried rice, a perfect mix of garlic and soy sauce (I believe). Break the egg yoke on top of the rice and you have a winner. I had the sweet pork (tosilog) and enjoyed it as well. 

Overall, relaxed friendly vibe, would come back to try their dinner in the future."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend and her cousins to the soft opening. Nice atmosphere and plenty of seating options. We decided to order everything on the menu while we enjoyed a few beers and cocktails. (Why not, the menu was a perfect size) The food did take about an hour after we ordered BUT, it was absolutely worth the wait. Actually, it was ALL so good that we ordered the entire menu again. My personal favorites was the sisig, BBQ pork, and there curry. Loved the fact that there was different, but, complex levels of flavor elevated by a touch of heat. Ill be sure to stop in again when in the area."}
