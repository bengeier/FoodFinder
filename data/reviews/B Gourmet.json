{"text":"Great place for lunch in Sewickley. Kind of expensive,  but everything in sewickley is pricey. Had the roast beef sandwich. Delicious. Got a side of honey sesame Brussels sprouts.   Yummy! Big portions.  You won't be disappointed.  My only complaints were that it was freezing cold and there is limited seating."}
{"text":"I so wish this place was closer to where I lived - the food here is fantastic. Happened to be nearby Sewickley, so I decided to check it out. There is a standard menu of sandwiches (ranging from $9-$13), soups, and salads posted on the wall menu. They have a rotating selection of items in their display. When I stopped by, the two sides that I were eyeing were butternut smashed potatoes ($7.99/lb) and the mac & cheese ($5). I didn't end up trying these, but they both look delish! I ended up ordering the roast beef sandwich ($11) and, omg, that was one of the best sandwiches I have eaten. The roast beef is extremely tender and flavorful, the farm bread was just the right texture, and the gorgonzola aioli had just the right balance of creaminess. I would order it again in a heart beat. And, of course, the owner was super nice and friendly. Without question, this place is easily a 5* establishment!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, I got the turkey, bacon panini and my husband got the curry chicken salad sandwich. They were both delicious! We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had in awhile. The pesto tuna melt is a unique twist on a traditional tuna melt but similar enough to be comfort food. Really fresh ingredients, including the bread. Love that there are so many to-go options to bring home for an easy dinner too. At least a dozen fresh made soups, plus fresh pasta, handmade veggie and regular burgers, lots of side salad options. Really great first experience. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and sides. Just on the pricey side for sandwiches but I guess they are gormet"}
{"text":"We arrived not too long before closing at 4pm on Saturday. It was our first time to visit. I had the roast beef sandwich; my wife had the chicken wrap. Both were excellent, but I have to also say it was probably the best roast beef sandwich I have ever had. I could not stop thinking about it the rest of the day. The service was great too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great option for a quick bite or take out. They are now open later on Friday nights during which they offer a variety of burgers"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch and an even better place for healthy, interesting take-out if you don't feel like cooking.  For lunch, my go-to is the Cobb salad.  For take-out, I go for the curry chicken salad.  It's sweet, savory, and delicious.  The crab cakes are also quite good, but they sometimes come out under heated.  Be sure to ask that they hear them for a few extra minutes.  

B Gourmet is a bit pricy, but Sewickley doesn't have a lot of options for a good casual lunch.  The ambiance is modern and casual, and the location is perfect for people-watching situated as it is in the center on Beaver St."}
{"text":"The quality and preparation of this food are incredible. Easily the best vegetable wrap I have ever eaten. Amazing cube of gourmet Mac and cheese. The Mediterranean salad was delicious - especially the artichoke chips and olive balsamic. The other fresh items looked amazing in the case. The review loses a star due to the transactional / unfriendly vibe of the staff and very short hours. But the flavors and quality make up for it, I guess."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype. I tried the chicken wrap which was recommended, and it did not disappoint. Fresh ingredients, fast service and a casual environment. I love that it's BYOB and right in town."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I have gotten take out from here many times, and every time they are very friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. I recently had the rosemary roast beef sandwich, and not only was it very good, it was very large too so I had it for two meals. Makes up for being a touch pricey! They also have great sides, and the quinoa with kale was very light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love bgourmet. Their only downfall is they are not a full service dinner restaurant. A girl can dream though.  The food is divided into three categories. They have a fixed menu of sandwiches, salads and a rotation of daily soups.they also have a wide assortment of food items for eating in or to take out (salads, meats and pastas). As well each night they post a dinner to go. You call ahead and place your order then pick up on your way home. 
We are frequent customers. Soup is a great lunch, as is the curried chicken salad.the Cobb salad is fabulous but our favorite item is the roast beef sandwich. My mouth is watering as I think of it.
If people ask me where to go for lunch in sewickley bgourmet is my #1 pick!
They also have fresh Amish eggs, milk, apple cider, assorted dips and local cheeses and bread."}
{"text":"Great place.  Check out their burgers - available every Friday.  BYOB if you eat 'em there!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with food. I think Bruneaux is better all the way around. Nice atmosphere and decor but lacks in one important area-food! Will pass on again. Do not reccomend"}
{"text":"I went to B Gourmet for lunch. it's a cute little place right on Beaver Street that had a short, but delicious looking menu of sandwiches, salads, and soup. It's the sister restaurant of Avenue B in Shadyside/Friendship. 

I ordered the crab cake sandwich. The cake was really good and tasted homemade. It was served on an English Muffin with basil aioli, arugula, and a slice of piquillo pepper. There was a choice of fingerling potatoes or house salad as a side. I went with the house salad. It was a simple salad with spring mix and a few cherry tomato halves. It had an a oil-based dressing that had a good, but subtle flavor. 

The meal was good and a great lunch portion. Just enough to fill me, but not enough to send me into a post-lunch full belly slump where I'm so full I just want to nap! With the portion size in mind, $13 seemed a little steep...with a drink I paid over $15, but considering it is fresh, delicious, and a locally owned establishment I didn't mind the price tag."}
{"text":"Avenue B is my favorite restauant in Pittsburgh so I've been anxious to try out their little outpost in Sewickley and was able to stop in for lunch. I wasn't exactly prepared for what we found - guess I was expecting more than a small deli-type spot. Not that that's a bad thing, I was just hoping for more luncheon offerings. With 7 sandwiches, 2 salads, and 2 soup options, it is a limited menu. But they do sell a host of prepared food out of the deli counter case including some appetizing looking curry chicken salad. Looks like a great place to order ahead and stop to take some tasty delights home for dinner!

My BBQ pulled pork sandwich was fabulous with a nice crunch provided by the Napa slaw and pickles. I'd order that again!  The soups of the day were black bean tortilla, which I found somewhat bland and uninspired, and the cauliflower bisque (which my wife got) that seems to lack flavor/seasoning - at least to my taste. Service was a bit slow and since there was only one other couple in the place when we got there, I assume the delay is due to everything being made to order. Seemed like a long wait for two sandwiches. But they were quite good. 

Chef Chris can cook for me anytime. Next time I'm in the Sewickley area and want a great sandwich, B Gourmet will certainly be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME with a captial AWES.   I love Avenue B and could not wait to try this place.  B Gourmet is similar to Avenue B in that is at the top of my list for places that I love but that's where the similarities end.  It's bistro/deli type foods.  You can eat in or get prepared foods to take home.  I've been there several times and everything I've had it simply incredible- so fresh, so delicious!"}
{"text":"B Gourmet is the best quick bite in Sewickley.  

Staff: friendly, warm and accommodating, talked us through the menu on our first visit, offered to split everything onto separate plate for me and my guest. Their attention to the details of hospitality really stood out. 

Food: absolutely terrific, simple and fresh, perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. We had the rosemary roast beef sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. The bread was fresh, rustic, slightly charred, the beef was perfectly cooked and sliced paper thin, arugula added a welcome peppery note and gorgonzola aioli made it a pretty perfect sandwich. The Brussels were savory and sweet with the addition of honey and sesame. Dessert: an INSANE Salted Heath Bar ice cream sandwich by Leona's Ice Cream Sandwiches (locally made). Thoughtfully cut in two for us :)

Ambiance: modern, airy, simple and clean - perfect vibe to highlight their cases of thoughtfully prepared food. Options are available to eat in or take away and re-heat at home. Options included chicken salad, pork chops, mac n cheese, roasted beets. Pittsburgh needs more options like this. 

Bottom line: the owners and staff of B Gourmet just get it - i would eat here for lunch or a take home dinner any day - or every day."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars because quality and effort need recognition.  The food and atmosphere were more of a 4-1/2 but we need more places like this in the suburbs. 

I can't believe the \"critics\" that give this place 3 stars whining about pricing, side dishes, and whatever else.... Blah blah blah.  There is a Burger King down the road with 1.49 nuggets if you trust the are not made of horse meat. 

The atmosphere is hip. The service was reasonable and the food was \"downtown- city\" quality.  Bread was perfect. Tuna melt was full of flavor. People watching through the massive front glass window was unique.  Will be back to support creativity and fresh, quality food.  Spare me... This Yelp crowd is starting to take itself way to seriously. Please! 

Wife, son and I had a nice lunch and will be back.  Furthermore,"}
{"text":"This place was great!! We were in town shopping and wanted a very quick bite. The inside is no-frills but the service is extremely friendly and everything is home made. My Mother and I split a sandwich and they served us on two different platters and the simple dressing for each of our side salads that came with our sandwich was delicious! The man at the counter told me what was in it, that he could sell it to me and if I wanted a big container I could even call ahead! Talk about going the extra mile. There were tons of freshly prepared salads and soups to take home and our food was delicious! Would highly recommend the turkey sandwich. Thank you B Gourmet!"}
{"text":"B Gourmet elevates the lunch experience by adding texture and unique flavors to its offerings.  You'd think a pulled pork sandwich would be pretty standard, but they put on a really tasty napa slaw cabbage with a side of delicious roasted potatoes.  I also had a tart strawberry lemonade that was refreshing.  We finished the lunch with a smores ice cream sandwich from Leona's.  Heavenly.  It ends up being a pretty pricey lunch, but it didn't disappoint for something unique and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem!  I went there for my first time today and was blown away.  The food was tremendous (roast beef sandwich and roasted fingerlings), the decor is tasteful and their retail area had some great offerings.  I will, beyond a shadow of a doubt, return for more."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Little place with a few tables and your meal comes in a little lunch pail.  The menu has some interesting choices and with homemade soup, creative sandwiches and wraps and a couple of salads.  There were some interesting items that your don't see in most deli's, BG is more of a fusion type deli.  In the case there were many creative and interesting items including a beet salad, meat loaf.  I kept it simple with the Smoked salmon BLT that had avocado and a grilled onion marmalade.  Sandwiches come with a nice green salad or some very tasty potatoes."}
{"text":"There is something very charming about the streets of Sewickley.  It's what you would expect from any small town.  They have a variety of small businesses and one of them is B Gourmet.

I visited on a recent early afternoon.  Parking is metered, so do not forget your quarters.  The store itself is very homey inside.  Along with sandwiches, they have a glassed in case displaying a few salads (think Mediterranean orzo and curried chicken salad), another case displaying meatloaf and chicken breasts.  I am under the impression that you can pick up dinner items here and taken them home and heat and eat.  I thought the price of the salads was kinda pricey at $8.99 a pound.  I missed the pricing on the meat items.  I saw large tubs of soup in refrigerator, but I would think that they probably have some warmed up ones somewhere.

I ordered a sandwich to go from their wall menu.  I got a grilled chicken & romaine wrap priced at $10.  I thought it was kinda of pricey, but it was pretty well packed with chicken, chicken, chicken and Parmesan-reggiano and sun dried tomato pesto.  I had asked for the sandwich to have the dressing on the side but the pesto inside it made it very greasey and messy to eat.  Also, it didn't really come with a side, just a bunch of lettuce stuffed in the container to help fill it up.  For $10, you should get a side.

They sell a lot of different items from the area like Mediterra bread which is a huge favorite of mine.  Also some local pretzel pieces and homemade cookies, etc.  I will try a couple more visits to see if I can warm up to this place."}
{"text":"In town on business and Yelp recommended this place.  It was delicious from the start. Had the smoked salmon blt. And service was friendly and fast."}
