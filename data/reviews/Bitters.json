{"text":"The good: The signature cocktails were really good.  I got the Bitter Safe than Sorry which was rye whiskey, Montenegro, lemon and apple. Average cost for craft cocktails  The bad: weird location in Skysong. Not close to anything else except for a bagel place next door. The upside is lots of parking.   The ugly: The food is more like tapas meaning small portions, which is fine. I had the short rib with polenta. The short rib lacked flavor and was dry. I had some of my friend's rock shrimp which was pretty food"}
{"text":"What a great cocktail parlor...it's kind of like bitter and twisted in downtown scottsdale.  Urge everyone to support this neat little place in South Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. It was my buddies 40th birthday party. The bartender knew their stuff.  Great drinks!"}
{"text":"For those who are confused, this is a bar with small plates, not a full restaurant. Thus, I am confounded when people here are frustrated by the small plate size of these delectable treats from  a menu that reads \"small plates\" LOL.  Yes, they are small because they are supposed to be small! The key is to get a few of these small plates and indulge your palate!   The ambiance is ideal and relaxing; I really enjoy the concept of local liquors and small batch everything. The food is sublime.  I am often looking for a local spot with astounding eats in a friendly atmosphere that is not pretentious, and Bitters meets that bill head on.   I had the Rock Shrimp (please let me bathe in this) and the Mac N Brie; seriously, so wonderful.  I am definitely happy that Bitters has landed in SoScottsdale as a reliable, inviting, worthwhile local bar.  For the person who said they don't have \"Coke\" that is because they only carry locally crafted sodas, so they don't have \"Coke\" but they do have sodas!"}
{"text":"Had the Mac n Brie and a few cocktails, everything was amazing. Mike the bartender (with the dreads) was a very knowledgeable mixologist!"}
{"text":"Amazing drink menu with fun tasty drinks! Crispy Pork Skins are a must! Little off the grid but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice local bar! Fun cocktails, good food nice atmosphere. Not sure you could ask for much more."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Great concept.  Food is great and drinks are phenomenal.   Met the owner Ericka, what a sweetheart.   This is going to be our new hangout spot. We'll definitely be back! #supportlocal"}
{"text":"We stop by before our event.  Our drinks were creative and delicious.  The bartenders were very knowledgeable, friendly and engaging.  I can't wait to go back. Food wise it was fantastic but the portions are very very small. Too pricey for the quantity but quality was top notch."}
{"text":"I came to bitters for a birthday celebration of over 10 people and the staff was so accommodating and attentive. It was a Friday night and the location was not too busy but still busy enough to where the atmosphere was lively. The drinks were well priced and tasty and the staff was quick to correct my drink order when it was mistaken for another. The food was tasty and an appropriate portion size. I really enjoyed having a diverse variety of options for my vegetarian diet. I also enjoyed the combination of both healthy, trendy foods with comfort, classic dishes. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best kept secret in Phoenix . Brittany the bartender was thw absolute best. Definitely try their version of an Old Fashioned, it's unbelievably smooth. Would recommend this place to anyone seeking a new craft cocktail experience that's cool and hip rather than pretentious."}
{"text":"Tapas would be a bit of a stretch to say but the beer and food were delicious. I took a date here on a Friday night around 9pm and the place wasn't too busy. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very lively and attentive. We had the braised shortrib with cheddar polenta and the Mac and Brie dish. Both were excellent!  I also had a beer off of their draft board menu and it was strong but good. She had a rose. The atmosphere is great and the service was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is delicious! Love the atmosphere and the vibe going on. Perfect location not to far from Old town or Mill. My boyfriend and I love to come to Bitters for drinks and a satisfying meal. They are small plates so perfect to get a couple different ones and share! We love their Roast Beef and the Brie Mac & Cheese..taste like home! Small plates are the best because then you have room for dessert ;)"}
{"text":"We attended the release party of the 2018 Women Collaboration Brew \"Murder She Oat\" . This IPA was quite tasty! We ordered the Bitter Chick, very good!  and the Crispy Chicken Buffalo MAC yum, and somewhat spicy! Our server was Javelle who was top notch!!! The best we have had at Bitters. Although we had been there before she was attentive, explained the menu in detail and sold us on a few items with her presentation."}
{"text":"Wicked cool new place. You gotta check it out. Fun interesting drinks in a chill relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Great food and drink, I would recommend to all my friends. We had the Mac and cheese and a couple of specialty drinks, yum"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Excellent service; you feel like you are the only person in the joint. Really great drinks; especially the \"elevated classics\". Cool and unique menu; just about every item has a 'zona twist. Highly recommend Bitters!"}
{"text":"This is a great new spot in south Scottsdale with original craft cocktails and tasty small plate options. I ordered the farro risotto salmon and the bitters crispy pork skins (yummm!) Staff are friendly and atmosphere is fun. The owner is awesome and engaged with customers. Looking forward to next visit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails, friendly staff, relaxed and fun vibe. Our new fav spot! Mike made us his version of an old fashion and it was delicious. We love the giant ice cubes and beautiful glassware used in our drinks. We are looking looking forward to joining the Bitters Enthusiast club and getting our own whiskey locker next time we go!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with friends. Our awesome server, Mike recommended the ahi tuna salad and the side of seasoned veggies fresh from their garden. The food was amazing!  The portions are respectable, presentation beautiful, and the service beyond expectation. We sat outside catching up with friends well after our bill was settled. Here comes Mike with 4 fresh waters to keep us hydrated. I've never experienced that before in a restaurant. On Mike's suggestion we finished our meal sharing the no bake cheesecake. Unbelievably delicious!  The sweetness of the blueberry sauce with the tartness of the cream cheese made this a fabulous ending. Bravo Bitters. You have amazing food and amazing staff."}
{"text":"Amazing new spot with a great location. Locally owned and clearly passionate about what they do. We ordered a bunch of items and shared for the table. A wonderful way to try all of the unique small plates. We loved everything we got from the flavored popcorn, chicken sandwich, beet salad, peppered ahi tuna, mac and cheese, beef satay and rock shrimp. And the drinks were delicious. Try their version of the Old Fashioned. It will not disappoint! Loved the friendly local bar vibe."}
{"text":"1st time here and blown away by the service, drinks, food and atmosphere. This place is casual attire great jams and a awesome all around vibe as soon as you walk in. This place is a gem in town you can find amazing deals if your local and your won't be let down. Ask for mike he makes drinks amazing and his feedback is always great Games are here and music is great as well."}
{"text":"Calum!! Our Best Freakin Ever Bar Tender !! He makes Old Fashions so \"amazing good\"!!   This place is a MUST!! I don't Rave about places, but this ha is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I brought my mom here the first time we checked it out. I loved the server we had, the food was clearly well-thought out by a chef who understands tasty and unique food pairings. I loved the drinks! We had cocktails, \"Bitter old and fashionable,\" for my mom and \"Bitter side of Rita,\" for me; both were excellent! We also tried the Mac and Brie (and added bacon because what the heck?) and the pork rind nachos which were the bomb. The cheeses on the two dishes we tried were delicious. I will be back for more! Oh, and they have a dog-friendly patio, I had my little dog with me which was really nice. Loveeee"}
{"text":"Gary is a fantastic bartender. Quality customer service and a great atmosphere! Highly recommend this spot for drinks after work!"}
{"text":"This place has grown so mich since opening. With the recent menu and cocktail updates, they have really stepped it up. The food menu has perfectly portioned dishes but there are plenty of larger items like the Chef Burger or the Bitter Chick sandwich (fried chicken). Some new Mac and Cheeses like Crispy Chicken Buffalo Mac. As for the cocktails, they have some of the best tasting and uniquely named drinks around. They don't have typical spirits you may be used to, but will help you find something to your liking. Some personal favorites are the Bitter Fruit, Bitter in-Lav, Bitter Co-Pilot, and the Bitter Gardner! I highly suggest you go in with an open mind and ask questions! The bartenders are very educated and the Owner Erika is very friendly! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent Sunday evening - what a great find! Neat space, great patio, interesting and yummy cocktails and great food on top of it! Not a location I would expect to find such a place - great find!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Drink menu has some great craft cocktails and the bartenders really take the time to make it just right. They only have small plate options but they are really tasty. If you are super hungry, you might find yourself ordering several small plates. Regardless a cool spot in South Scottsdale. I'm sure they will pick up business as more and more people discover it."}
{"text":"What a cool place!!  Super looking design.. this place is sure to please your tastebuds.  Our waitress Jenna was fantastic. Attentive and knowledgeable.  The bartender Brittany did a great job on the hand crafted cocktails.  Food was delish. Seared Ahi, buffalo Mac and simple salad and s'mores pudding. All terrific we will be back.  Support this place ppl I'd hate if it went away.  Not often are their gems like this.   Great concept, great food. Thanks for the nice time."}
{"text":"I love Bitters.  I come here frequently. I love the concept of custom-made craft cocktails and small plate food items. It is small plate tapas style so I always get two different dishes. Love the concept. It's different, fun, local and all craft.   My favorite drinks: the bitter side of Rita, the bitter ex, and the bitter fruit. My favorite dish is the salmon. My second dish I usually get and love is the satay. If I just come to drink I usually try the different craft popcorns or get the pork rinds to snack on with my drinks.   The staff has always been friendly and accommodating. The environment is very cool, comfortable, laid back. I like to come watch football on Thursdays and Sundays.   Check Bitters out if you want to try a new concept to the valley and love to drink and eat!"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want a bucket of food for $5. Come here if you want quality over quantity, delicious food, amazing service and memorable drinks. I live next door so I went in wanting to love this place, and they exceeded my expectations. I came with my boyfriend and we ordered 4 small plates to share and we each had 2  beers. We came during happy hour which is Tues-Fri 3-6pm so our pints were only $5 each. I had the boulevard lager, and barrio grapefruit which I highly recommend! For food we did the burrata, hot and sweet popcorn, blistered veg, and rock shrimp. Everything was great but the rock shrimp and burrata really blew us away! We even ordered more charred bread to soak up the delicious buttery shrimp sauce, which is SO worth the 1 freaking dollar!! Erica, the owner, introduced herself and listened carefully to our critiques which is just keep doing what you're doing because Bitters is perfect for what it is; an enticing and comfortable ambiance for incredible drinks and savory bites. Can't wait to come back with our dog on the patio! Also, there is a discount for Skysong residents which will also bring us back. I love you Bitters!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink last weekend before heading out to dinner.  Very friendly staff, nice atmosphere and a great selection of cocktails, wine and beer.  We ended up with a glass of wine and a bottle of passion fruit cider...nice way to kickoff the evening!"}
{"text":"Definitely starting to bounce back from its launch at the end of last year. Great whiskey selection, excellent craft beer selection that rotates often and features several great local brews, bar games on a dog friendly patio, and knowledgable staff that can whip up a hell of a cocktail, classic or contemporary. Ask about the barrel-aged cocktail, it changes every month or so but it's usually worth it."}
{"text":"Best mojito I've ever had. I wish it was in a big gulp. Great braised taco and ahi tuna too!!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new spot today. Love there is a craft cocktail place in the neighborhood! We had cocktails and dessert which is really the only important parts lol. Had a twist on the old fashion it was great and came with a show see pics. They have a bunch of twists on classics they were good and ones we did not try looked good.  They have good ice (if u don't know why I post that then u must love soda ice) and great bartenders. It's great getting drinks from someone who loves what they do and knows their craft! Thanks Chuck (sorry if I got that wrong they were good drinks)!  We got the s'mores dessert but my wife ate it before I took a photo... let's just say it's good. Live music arrived as we left but that's awesome. We did not get food but it looked good. Was concerned it's small plates at $10ish a pop but did not see size or if it would be filling. Will have to check it out again and eat so I will update. For sure an awesome happy hour and hang out but can't judge is \"foodiness\" I will go back and would recommend it! As for people who go to opening night and slam a restaurant clearly have never worked in the industry. We did not experience any snobby attitude or slow service, maybe that reviewer was just being a dick. Anyway you will enjoy this place so let's support a local small business owner as they carve out a market in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot with great service and drinks. But, the young woman strangling some of the best songs ever recorded killed the vibe. Inauthentic torturous renditions that, were Bob Dylan dead, he would spin in his grave. Just sing it straight. Stop yodeling. Turn it down.  Live music should make people want to stay. What. A. Buzzkill."}
{"text":"Trivia Night Uhggg!  Full house and very busy bartender, and then the shouting over the PA system.   I took my time getting in to check this place out and then that was poorly timed. A cool rainy night and some drinks sounded good, lets try Bitters!   I cant fault them for a trivia night as I imagine its the busiest night, but what I wasn't expecting was slow service and having to ask for everything. I bet this place is way better then that, and I promise to give that a second chance.   Service was from a awkward and self Proclaimed millennial that tried to endear himself by calling us old. Odd commentary, but true.   Food was a let down, after begging to order, a few options on the VERY SMALL menu were not available tonight. A Slider, Bitter Chick, and Buffalo Mac and cheese were ordered, then eventually............ delivered. The Bitter chick came with a pickle as the menu described, I laughed when I saw a pinkie toe sized pickle (it was actually smaller) The Bitter Chicken sandwich could have easily been forgettable but it was expensive and not very good, super soggy on weird bread (think round hole square peg or visa versa) as was the slider. The slider was ok and Mac and Cheese was tasty but WAY OVER PRICED!  Cool space and it definitely has a personality, and its close to home, so expect me back for another try.  Stay tuned boys and girls and old people."}
{"text":"Yummo! The service was fast and friendly. We sat on the patio, which is dog friendly. The ambiance was super comfy. We couldn't hear any traffic, being as close to Scottsdale and McDowell, that was amazing. The food was superb.  My boyfriend and I split 4 small plates: the braised short ribs on cheesy polenta,  the rock shrimp, the salmon on farro risotto and the brie and mac.  All of them were delectable! A welcome addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We've been to Bitters several times and each time, we're blown away! The food, drinks, staff and atmosphere are the BEST!  I would HIGHLY recommend the Bitter Ol Mule and the braise short ribs!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was a little weird - menu was arty but it's basically a sports bar set up. Great location. I hope they make some changes to make it more interesting."}
{"text":"Every bit of what I hoped it would be. Great local business for south Scottsdale. The owner was making her rounds and stopped by to greet us and tell us about upcoming events and everything they have to offer. She's born in the Valley and knows the local flavor. Chuck was our bartender and he put together some good stuff for us. The pictures won't do it justice(Yamazaki 12 year). Definitely  enough to keep us there longer than expected. Their bottom shelf is your average bars middle or top shelf."}
{"text":"Love this new spot!! Their food is really good (we've had the Mac & Brie, the Crab Cakes, and their popcorn) and reasonably priced. The staff is all super nice, knowledgeable and helpful. And their cocktails - omg! Those are the Arizona Sour and Old and Fashionable and they're both so good! Definitely will be coming back more!"}
{"text":"Someone alert Bitters that they are in south Scottsdale and therefore their snobby NoSco attitude simply wont be tolerated.   We live in the neighborhood. Oh, how we wanted to LOVE Bitters. There aren't many trendy places nearby (read: within stumbling distance) so we waltzed into Bitters with high hopes. Previous reviews rave about the fancy cocktails, unique tapas menu selection and comfortable ambiance.   Ok. So. Ambiance - yes, yay!  Cute, lighted patio. Cool vibe inside. We sat down at the bar, circa 8:15pm Friday night. It took ANY ONE of the FIVE bartenders at least 10 minutes to even make eye contact with us. What the hell is happening here??! The bar was not full. It's their opening weekend. How are you not making eye contact or saying hello to absolutely everyone who even glances in your direction?  Are your suspenders too tight because you are not too good to say hello to customers who are (were) downright giddy to be there and spend a pretty penny.   While I'm on that topic - truffle popcorn. Could there be anything more amazing?  Yes, like, everything could be more amazing. Small serving (I get it, it's a tapas place, fine), flavorless, piled on a tiny plate. Boo.   We also had the crab cake (singular) which was delicious actually, but also tiny. Catering to models maybe? I don't know.   This review comes from such a sad place in my heart. I wanted to like Bitters so much, I'm just insanely bitter that it didn't live up to my expectations in the slightest. We counted down the minutes until someone paid enough attention to us to get our bill, and headed straight for McFate.   Bitters, I hope you get off your high hipster horse quickly and start singing a more humble, grateful tune. Haven't you heard?  Kind is the new cool."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Bitter, Old and Fashionable! It's by far one of the best Old Fashions I've had and it's my go to every time! Awesome patio with games too!"}
{"text":"I don't do the five stars rating, because it's rare for any restaurant to be *that* good. Four is the highest but not the best for me  I went to this place with my co-workers for drinks. Ordered an old fashioned, and what I got was...not quite right. So my next drink was a beer, an orange-flavored hefeweizen. I was pleased with my second drink  The outdoor vibe and atmosphere was nice. I enjoyed it. Price was too expensive for a mixed drink, but beer price was reasonable.  Like most places in Scottsdale, you pay for their rent in the price of everything you order. Keep that in mind and I think this place is pretty decent for the atmosphere, service and drinks. I didn't try their food"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing!   Every food items we have ordered has been beyond delicious! (And we've ordered quite a few of them!) I can't even pick a favorite appetizer or entree, but if you haven't had the warm whiskey apples dessert, you are lacking sheer bliss in your life!   And the drinks? Bitter Mule, Bitter Mary (with bacon!), and Bitter Fruit, Oh my! But the Bitter Ex? Oh, the Bitter Ex! I am happily married, but this drink is my ultimate fave!  If you haven't been to this hidden little treasure, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"When it comes to speakeasy's, I think dark, late night, hidden booths and nooks. Bitters considers itself a speakeasy but it is way too bright and hipster to be considered that. More of a cocktail bar. We went for HH but none of their cocktails are included. Just beer, wine, and well drinks. And there were only 2 food items. We ordered the popcorn to munch on and it was chewy. They said the butter makes it chewy but we make homemade buttered popcorn at home that is never chewy. We sent it back thinking it was old and they were gracious and sent a new bowl out but it was also chewy. Although their cocktail list is ok, it's not extensive. I was disappointed with both my drinks. My wife didn't like one of hers so the bartender made her a different drink. She said the same....they were fine, not great. But at 10-13 bucks a drink, that's an expensive risk to take when you're not sure you'll even like the drinks. Even if they knocked 2 bucks off for HH, we'd likely have tried other ones. The saving grace and 5 stars should go to Mike...the bartender. Although we didn't think much of the drinks, his energy and conversation skills did much to make this less than average visit more pleasant."}
{"text":"GREAT food, great drinks. The service sucks every time I go there. Sad, because we live close by and wish it was better."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Verve - Bittersweet Symphony)  Cause it's a Bitters sweet gastropub this spot Trying to make the Yelp list, I'll rave about the burgers that I'lI try  I'll take you down the Scottsdale Rd I've ever been down You know the bites that takes you to the places where all the ASU kids meet, yeah  No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change, and I'm here for the food, I am here for the food And I'm a million reviews away from one badge to the next I can't change my name, Bo, Bo, Bo, Bo, Bo, Bo, Bo   I love the layout of this bar.  I love how the daylight shines through and brightens the place up.  The bar itself has a rustic industrial feel but very spacious and airy.    Anyways, let's talk about food and drinks!  I started with their take on the Old Fashion; probably my favorite now in regards to a modern twist with a hint of hazelnut and a silk and velvety texture.    As for the food, we ordered the Buffalo Chicken Nug, Onion Rings, Chips & Avocado, Peppered Crusted Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and The Bitter Chef Burger.  Yeah I guess it looked like I was pretty hungry but I was sharing!  The Buffalo Chicken was okay I didn't think much of it since I generally like my fried chicken dry with sauce on side; nothing too fancy here except they were boneless.  The onion rings were fresh to the cut and lightly breaded; not your typical thick greasy onion rings which is welcoming.  I will skip over the Chips and Avocado since I gather you know what to expect and so did I, though you can't go wrong with chips and avocado.  I was somewhat disappointed with the Short Ribs since they were swimming in a puddle of its own juice and polenta.  It was almost like congee, but very bland I thought.  I wish it was more plated and thicker in texture like a demi-glaze; granted the ribs itself was well cooked.    Moreover, the Peppered Crusted Ahi Tuna was one of my favorite bites of the night!  Lightly seared and well crusted with pepper and topped with wonton chips and wasabi peas; this was like a nigiri with texture and just enough pop from the wasabi!  My second favorite of the night was the Bitters Chef Burger, which is always a rotating menu item.  Our was a charbroiled patty, which you can definitely taste along with pickled onions, avocado and the fixin'.  Overall, the bun a patty ratio was on point and the bun lightly toasted to give it a butter bun texture.  The avocado was creamy while the onions gave it some crunch.    In the end, Bitters was a welcoming spot and service on point.  Erika, the owner I gather was helpful and delightful as she recommended the Old Fashion for me as well as other libations as the day progressed.  The ambiance is fun and whimsical with board games and from what I hear trivia night.  This is a must revisit in my books! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a new craft cocktail bar and gastropub on the ASU Skysong campus.  It seems to be a brand new building with high ceilings and exposed ductwork.  There's an outside patio, a large U-shaped bar and some tables and booths along the side of the bar.  Bitters has a fairly large selection of their own craft cocktail creations along with a well-curated list of craft beer and wine.  I went with the Bitter Ex cocktail which had vodka, mango and a little habenero for some kick.  It was very refreshing.  We shared the rock shrimp appetizer that came in a bowl with some toast to sop up the extra broth.  It wasn't very substantial but the flavors were very nice.  Service at the bar was very good.  One suggestion that I'd make is that the beer selection is printed on a chalkboard on one wall.  If you are sitting on that side of the bar you can't see it because it's behind you.  Also, some of the colors of the chalk are hard to read because they don't contrast very well with the background."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   I must take a moment to give accolades to this new and exciting business in Scottsdale called BITTERS! What a find!  This is the type of business that is so steeped in perfection and so well thought out, that one visit isn't enough to thoroughly appreciate and understand all it has to offer, but let me try.  BITTERS  Bitters is owned and operated by Erika Rode who has made a tremendous name for herself in the Phoenix service industry for the last 15 years. She has parlayed her experiences into Bitters, which she opened 5 months ago.  Bitters is dedicated to promoting everything craft and craft culture.  Absolutely 100% clean elegance.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  Bitters is the type of establishment that is service oriented. Upon entering, Mike was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly. He went out of his way to say numerous times I could sit anywhere and he would find me. Mike and Chuck were behind the bar making the most OUTSTANDING ONE-OF-A-KIND specifically drinks with homemade recipes you've never tried but you definitely need in your life!!  We tried 3 of their specialty drinks and an Arizona craft beer. My favorite was called the Co-Pilot.  Mike explained the origins of each drink, the background of the specialty glasses, including the honorary copper glasses the owner received from Patron and more.   Everything was to perfection.   My only regret, is that I wasn't hungry enough to try the food. Everything I saw looked INCREDIBLE!!  CONCLUSION  I honestly think that BITTERS is the newest and greatest hot business to watch!  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *For more information: bittersbar.com  *Plenty of parking out front."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place last week because were in the area and there yelp reviews. .  Bitters has a great vibe and awesome patio the staff was very nice and the \"Bitter Fruit\" tastes just like a Orange Julius.:) yummy!! the honey hot popcorn is a great snack with  a lot of flavor and crispy chicken stick was good but could use to be served with a more flavorful sauce. The only big issue was the two food items took a very long time (35-40 mins) to come out not sure why the kitchen took so long with less than 20people.  All in all I will go back again and recommend it."}
{"text":"The drinks are delicious! I personally think they're worth the price. The service, however, is extremely poor. I was really looking forward to a new bar/restaurant in this area but I doubt I'll be returning just for the drinks. The prices are way too high for the food. A friend of mine ordered the cheesecake thinking it would be at least a regular sized slice but it was probably only an inch and a half high and the diameter of it was only that of a dollar coin.   Overall: drinks are yummy; food and service are not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Scottsdales biggest secret when it comes to mixed drink perfection. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to how my negronis and greenpoints are made. Candidly speaking, I was skeptical about this place because I had not heard much about it. Service was impeccable and the two aforementioned drinks? The best I've ever had. Kitchen was closed when I came in, but if the food is even half as good as the drinks, then ladies and gentlemen, this will set the bar that all other restaurants strive to meet."}
{"text":"Gary is the best bartender by far. Very personable and attentive. Love coming to this place!!"}
{"text":"Went here after reading about it in New Times. The cocktail was amazing. A Bourbon, Old and Fashionable.  The food good and popcorn was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazingly poor customer service - We were ignored for a good twenty minutes before someone picked up on the fact that we needed help.  In between that time, we tried to get the attention of the bartender, various servers, and even the manager.  We will not be returning here, and I cannot recommend this pace at all."}
{"text":"This place is just what south Scottsdale needed! The location is in Skysong, across the street from McFate. Inside, there is exposed brick, high ceilings with exposed air ducts. I love it! It's hip and modern and classically trendy. I sat at the bar because I love watching experienced bartenders make complex cocktails. I ordered the For Bitter or For Worse and the Bitter Ex to drink. I really liked the For Bitter or For Worse; it was perfectly balanced and refreshing. Plus it had a candy gummy in it! For food, we order the mac & brie (omg the grilled bacon in this was amazing), the blistered seasonal veggies, the short rib (which is on top of delicious cheddar polenta), and the slider of the day (BBQ pulled pork). The portions are tapas sized, but I was full after splitting four items with one other person. I was really happy with all of the food, which is impressive for a place with a strong focus on drinks/cocktails! I want to come back to try the satay, pork skin, and all of the desserts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I along with my bro and his wife checked this place out on around 8 pm on a Saturday night. Expected it to be busy, but there were only about 2 other parties there. The service was on pointe, and you can tell the mixologists behind the bar know what they're doing and take pride in the drinks. There's a cool/unique selection of cocktails and a ton of different flavors of bitters - including chocolate bitters, which I didn't even know existed. The place was really clean and felt few with high ceilings and comfortable read leather booths. We each got drinks and everyone enjoyed theirs. We also each got the $2 chicken on a stick with dipping sauce. Super tasty, but 1 is not enough if you're hungry! Great deal for only $2, though! Overall, the place didn't really wow me. May have enjoyed it more if it were more hoppin and didn't feel like a quiet ghost town. I'm guessing it was just the night that I was there (Saturday), because it seems like a place that should get a lot of business due to the quality of service, food, and drinks!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last night for the first time and was so pleasantly surprised. I think the prices are reasonable: drinks and food are delicious!!!! I got the Bitter Fruit (2 of them) and then my boyfriend and I split the burger. The. Best. Burger. I've had since moving to Scottsdale. Our waitress was also a delight, I wish I remembered her name. I highly recommend, kind of wish for their sake it was in a better location since the decor is so cute, the atmosphere is open and inviting... I want it to be seen!"}
{"text":"Bitter fruit tastes like a dreamsicle. Service was great and classy. Trivia is also fun"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink the other day and we were very impressed. The ambience is super cute and the staff is so friendly. I got the Red blend and my boyfriend got an Old Fashioned, both were great. The menu looked good, but we didn't order anything. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"So glad to have finally come in to try this place out. I've driven by it daily but had never got the chance to stop in until recently. Great food and amazing drinks!   Smoky old fashion and crispy chicken sandwich are both must try items! Your welcome ahead"}
{"text":"Great drinks, even the wells!!! An absolute must. Great service! They have beer and wine too."}
{"text":"The sliders were probably the best I have ever had! Drinks were really good, atmosphere was really chill. Great spot, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty flavorful but for the price there is so little food that we were actually laughing when it came out.  Sad.  They will close super fast if they don't fix the portion size.  Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place!!!!!! Good food -get chicken sticks.  The drinks even better!   Thanks Mike from Chicago!   Great service"}
{"text":"Meh... I was stoked to find a \"cool\" place near the pad, so I stopped by on their soft open to Czech it out. I never do Yelp reviews, but felt it needed one from me. So, strap in.. I'm not going back... -  for a while at least. The place looks rad. Awesome patio, cool interior, vibe, music etc.. There weren't many people there honestly which surprised me, but after sitting at the bar for - over - 10 minutes (yes I timed it), and STILL not a word from any of the 4 bartenders walking around - I started to get antsy. I actually had to ask the people next to me if I could borrow their menu. Finally someone looked up, and actually saw me sitting there. (You can't escape my eye contact bro...) Promptly followed by a - \" I'll be with you in a minute\" (or 5).. So, I asked for my go to, a crown and Coke.. \"Fervent gasp!\" \"We don't serve coke products sir\".. (or anything other than pineapple juice aparantly?) How silly of me. Ok what do you recommend? \"Here's a drink menu...\" - Then back to walking around aimlessly behind the bar, not actually helping anyone..  anyway, long story short..... Had a couple tiny appetizers, then frantically flagged down a bartender for my check.. eagerly exited the premises with haste. Not gonna last. Too pricey for the - too cool, \"hipster\" crowd anyway.. Hopefully they realize where they're located and act accordingly. Ok, peace out."}
{"text":"I love Bitters! The food portion is just right, oh and SO delicious! The drinks are hand made each time, not from some pre-made sugary syrup. I went one day and just ordered water with my meal, and the bartender Chuck made me a fancy water! He was so entertaining and made me not feel so bad for just having water. The cocktails are to die for! My favorite is the Mule or Bitter Side of Rita. Try it out, sit in the patio, bring your dog. Hang out and enjoy this local spot from an AZ native. Can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Such an awesome place! Games, trivia, and an awesome set up! Modern, chic, and awesome people!"}
{"text":"So, I'm leaning between 3.5 and 4 I REALLY liked this place and I definitely think they've learned their lesson from the earlier comments about attention and service - I (and everyone after me) were greeted when they walked in! The bartender was great and what he didn't do the other one did - great tandem work!  I know they are a craft cocktail place and the prices honestly seem reasonable - even the $18 manhattan that comes with a show!!  My issue is really the small plate choices - I think there should be more if that's all they serve. I would also like a more robust wines by the glass - I am only going to do one cocktail and would like reasonably priced wines by the glass - I'll stay longer and order more small plates if there was more to choose from. I love the location and the ambiance! I'll be back to try again - I really hope they find the \"sweet spot\" of service and offerings, I'm rooting for this one and hope to amend my review in the future!!"}
{"text":"BBQ MAC and Cheese delish!  Chopped Kale Salad Pepper Crusted Ahi Tuna salad   Great selection of craft beers too.   Come here and enjoy the gourmet dishes."}
{"text":"We just left this new place and it was our first time. Plates are very small for the price. The server with the nose ring didn't know her menus more drink menus and worse she didn't know what alcohol that was stocked. I ordered a Don Julio Margarita and I get the check and she charged me $38 for some Don Julio 1942 that I didn't order. Why would I want a premium tequila in a margarita. I ordered a simple Don Julio margarita. Terrible way to conduct business. We won't be back until they step it up."}
{"text":"Over priced, Small portion, Poorly cooked!!!! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken and waited until I received a Cup of breaded and badly seasoned chicken Breast. The Chicken Temperature was spotty and in places COOL!.  For your money it is my Suggestion to look at other restaurants in this area! In my opinion this restaurant will be closed in shortly! This bar SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for cocktails! Located in Scottsdale but it is not your typical Scottsdale bar.   Very opened and laid back.  Bartenders are very knowledge and cocktails are expertly made.  The Bitter Ex cocktail is a must get!"}
{"text":"Want a great cocktail in Scottsdale, go here.  Honey hot popcorn was great as well.  We had three cocktails bitter happiness, bitter safe than sorry, and bitter sweet all were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Staff is very knowledgeable. I love this new place.  Exotic beers and wines. Unique great food.  Chuck, Bailey are awesome.  I'm so glad I found this place"}
{"text":"The real way to make an Aviation. If you're looking for a bar in Scottsdale that can make you a drink the right way, look no further. Bitters is the right place."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood just south of Skysong, so I was eager to check out this place. The first craft cocktail lounge between Old Town and Tempe. Planning on bringing people here for my birthday, I wanted to pre screen so I knew what to expect. I invited a friend to join me, Tuesday night, Halloween.   Atmosphere is pleasant. Not overly commercial or hammed up, and isn't clearly catered to any one market (no mason jars or Edison bulbs here), just generally classy but casual. I would say it could use a little more attention to interior and exterior design, as an easy way to really step it up. But this is just nit picky and by no means a serious mark against. I love the halfway inside/outside format with adequate spacing inside and a large patio. The patio did feel a tad sparse though.   Service: I joined by my friend and greeted pretty early on by a very friendly young bartender. We explored the options and solicited his advice. My friend ordered a custom drink at the mercy of our bartender. I ordered the barrel aged cocktail. One note: the Bitters font is a little hard to read, errs on the side of novelty. Another nit pick.  Anyway, he brought back my drink and it tasted really weak. Like iced tea even. I mentioned it to him, and he realized he had given me iced tea and gave it to me on the house. My friends drink was not bad but not great. When I got my actual drink it was decent! A little smokeyness but the appeal of the barrel aging was lost on me.   My second drink was a Mezcal based drink. It was good but also a little weak, and lacking in punch. My friend ordered the raspberry sour, which took close to an eternity, but as we learned the owner herself was making great pains to ensure it came out correctly. The egg whites were not fluffing to her satisfaction, so this drink was also gratis. It was tasty (and probably my favorite of the evening) but my companion wished it were more bourbon-forward.   All that said, the owner made a point to take notes of our impressions and saw to it we were satisfied. The bill was certainly very reasonable for the four drinks we had, and the attention to hospitality convinced me to come back!  3 stars because the drinks themselves didn't wow us, but this review is subject to change."}
{"text":"Bitters was absolutely wonderful!  Before going, we drove by and at home, we checked Yelp and Bitters' website.  All looked good and got in the car and went.  It was Friday around 4ish.  Nice and open and I'll call it a comfortable bright delightful atmosphere.  Our server Javelle was outstanding.  She was cheerful, helpful and just the right amount of friendliness.  As to the food, wow!  We ordered three things to share.          The first starter was \"BOWL O' RINGS\" Shoestring cut onions that were flavored out of this world.  I wanted them ALL!  Why isn't this on every menu everywhere!?  The other starter was \"2 Pigs 1 Bowl\" aka Pork Nachos.  HOLY PIG!!!!!  Cracklins / Chicharrones with bbq pork on them with a bit of cheese and something else.  I think I've only had cracklins only a couple times in my life.  Nothing I care to pay for or order out.... UNTIL THIS DISH!  I could have eaten the whole bowl.  But the good news is that we loved sharing each of the dishes, because both of us were so happy with everything!  Betty tried the Papago Orange Blossom beer and it was really good, with a hint of vanilla making it tastier.  When Javelle asked her what kinds of beer she likes, it was her suggestion.  Right on the money.       The entree was the Short Rib braised in red wine served with soft cheddar polenta.  It was fall off the bone tender, tasted just like my roast beef, with the best polenta I've ever had.  (No, I'm not a polenta aficionado but I loved it!)       As to desserts, we were quite tempted, but we had dessert waiting at home.  So NEXT time, we are going to try more things and get dessert.     The menu had a few things different than the online menu, but the owner, Erika, told us that she's listening to what people are saying and ordering... adjusting to what works best!  It was great that she took the time to answer every question we came up with after our meal.  GREAT people, GREAT food and Great atmosphere... we are definitely returning, with friends."}
{"text":"This is a newer spot adjunct on the Skysong property. They have some excellent cocktails which appears to be their passion. The bartender looks like an artist crafting each drink. They have a decent selection of liquors and craft beers, too. The ambiance is eclectic.   They have a small menu for small plates. They should add more food options. The food is great, just limited. The location is peculiar to thrive as a stand-alone cocktail bar."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place and good draft selections. I love the 2 pork 1 bowl HH app and that it's so close to my house and work. However, if I don't sit at the bar the service is spotty at best. The last 2 times I was there I sat on the patio and always felt like I had to flag someone down. One night was a super nice girl who really seemed like she was trying her best, but then the other time I was with coworkers and the guy paid no attention what so ever. One girl didn't get her drink in a solid 20 minutes and had to leave early. Another never got her drink at all. The rest of us were there for like an hour and a half and we only ever got to order one drink before we decided to tab out. All-in-all I'll be back because of proximity and I'm not ready to write it off, but for now I'll sit at the bar and not choose to take any groups here."}
{"text":"I had the braised short rib and the blistered vegetables. The first bite of that short rib felt like I died and went to heaven. So juicy and tasty. The craft beer options are great and some awesome craft cocktails to choose from.  Everything is fresh, made in house. Can't wait to get through the rest of the menu. The desserts sound amazing too. That'll be next time."}
{"text":"Great place Good food, great service and Bonus... Great atmosphere to unwind  and enjoy so fun. The Bartender (Mike) was awesome at customer service and his  mixologist  skills made our drinks on point.  Made it even enjoyable when trying new things. The seating is great and there is not a bad seat in the house! Ask about a locker if your in the area! Local gem in the town you will not be let down! Ask about specials or recommendations from Mike!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a group of friends for lunch.   We called a head to let them know we would have a party between 8-10 people. Working at Groupon we had heard great things and wanted to come try them. Sadly that's when the great things stopped.   They have really small portions. Like two or three bites and that's it for $10+ dollars a entree.I included a photo of the portion of Mac n cheese compared to a normal fork. The service was terrible. Two of my friends the waitress forgot about them, so they never even got to order. Majority of the table had to get their food to go. I won't recommend coming here until they change their portions, prices or retrain their staff."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to visiting this new spot and it did not disappoint.  Beautiful layout and plenty of seating.  I swung by after work and grabbed a spot at the bar.    Service throughout the night was excellent.  While you could tell the staff was learning the ins/outs they are had a positive attitude and checked in frequently.    For food, i ordered the burrata as well as the short ribs with polenta. Both were very tasty and I'll give the short ribs the slightest edge.  I'm a fan of whiskey so I started with a pour of Blanton's single barrel bourbon.  Per the owners recommendation, i moved onto two variations of WhistlePig.  Very enjoyable and I enjoyed tasting some stuff I hadn't had before.    Everyone at the bar seemed to be raving about their food and drinks as well.  This is just what South Scottsdale needed in my opinion.  I'm looking forward to many visits in the future including the perks associated with the Bitters Enthusiast Club that i signed up for.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Mike, the bartender, is awesome! Inventive and welcoming. We will be keeping this bar in mind for the future!"}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago not really knowing what to expect and overall I was pleased Bitters. No they do not serve full size dishes, they serve tapas/appetizer sized dishes. So if you want huge over sized portions of food you may want to go somewhere else. Our group ordered a little of everything and we all shared/sampled with each other. Out of everything I tried, and I sampled quite a few of the dishes, my favorites were the Mac and Brie, Kale Chips, Crab Cake and the Short Rib. Service could have been a little bit better and I wish the wine list was a bit larger, but overall I enjoyed the food, drinks and atmosphere. I will probably be making a return visit at some point."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the new neighborhood spot tonight. Just came in for food this time, but everything we had was delicious! Some of the better food I've had in Oldtown. Can't wait to come back in for some cocktails!"}
{"text":"I got the kale salad with chicken and it was DELICIOUS-the only problem was the portion was literally around one cup. Hubby got the salmon and it was also delicious! We then waited half an hour for the server to swipe our credit card, and the place wasn't even half full nor seemed be understaffed. Still, I would come back if the portions were filling instead of snack size."}
{"text":"Good spot for food and drinks, with a nice patio. Nice atmosphere , great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had one of the best times. Great cocktails. Expect a fun staff who wants to have a good time. The vibes are great and so are the cocktails!!!! Will return! Mike, caleb and brittany were amazing host!"}
{"text":"Just checked out a new spot in our neighborhood at Sky Song in South Scottsdale! Bar, Restaurant with a Patio!  We tried a few items off the menu. Satay, Burrata and Short Rib....I loved and Hubbs loved. Smaller portions which I think is perfect. Cocktails were great. To finish our visit we ordered dessert.... Campfire S'Moresso Good!! Owner is sweet and staff is very nice. We will back! Thank you Bitters"}
{"text":"Bitters is a great addition to South Scottsdale. We are so happy that it opened. The owner, Erika, is very personable and the food+drinks are wonderful. We like it so much we are thinking of having our wedding rehearsal dinner on the patio. :)"}
{"text":"Screw this place. Bartender made some snotty comment about the drink I ordered. Dude, you're a hipster loser tending bar for a living. Not a good one with unfunny sarcastic comments either. Some advice- maybe try being nice to the customer so they come back. Acting like a pretentious douche is bad for business and your tips.  Place was empty anyways.  Don't waste your time. There are a million other places with better drinks, crowd, customer service and prices. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot with a lot of potential.  I loved hearing that Chef Ehren is able to forage from the amazing garden adjacent to the restaurant!  Wonderful fresh flavors in his dishes.  The burrata and the slider special did not disappoint!  The others at the table loved the popcorn and the short rib.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place and I know we will be back, I wish I could tell more people about it to keep it alive. This place exemplifies the laid back, high quality, old town Scottsdale vibe.   Atmosphere - whiskey barrel country theme. We sat at the bar but there are booths, tables and outdoor seating. They may allows dogs? I'd call to check. There is also a lounge area in the back towards the restrooms. Laid back but if you came dressed for a night out you'd still fit in.   Drinks - AMAZING. We were there earlier in the evening and had an amazing experience of custom cocktails made by a bartender that was excited to be creative. We ordered two drinks off the menu initially that were excellent, our next drinks we spoke with bartender about what we wanted and and he created incredible custom feeling cocktails.  It doesn't have to be whiskey, they do everything.   I would come here as a first stop before a night out/nice dinner OR the more chill nights with friends who you want to just relax with, hear conversation and play a game (card, board, corn hole, Jenga.. they have it all)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went during opening weekend and it is decorated in urban chic, very nice, comfortable. The service was good not overly friendly.  The girls behind the bar were new and trying hard to please although they were a little slow on making some of their craft cocktails. Luckily they weren't busy because I don't know what the two of them would do if they were slammed. I'm not a cocktail person and prefer my bourbon or tequila neat but tried two they recommended and they were good but pricey. They are using good quality liquor and a lot work goes into making them so I guess there's your price. Probably no more expensive than what a fine restaurant in Scottsdale charges.  But as for the food we didn't get much but the price for the truffle popcorn is over the roof. $5.00 for 2 handfuls of popcorn??? Come on! That just highway robbery. And it was nothing to write home about. We also had the smores dessert which again comes in a tiny little cup. Some chocolate pudding graham cracker and marshmallow and it was just okay. Food is way too pricey for what you get. 4 Stars for the drinks, 3 stars for the food and 1 star for the prices.  Doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Only open a few days so it was a bit slow when we went in. Tried the salmon dish with the risotto, man that was really delicious I ate the whole thing! I wasn't able to try the specialty cocktails since I really wanted wine- but they looked really good I'll have to get next time!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to to Bitters since opening and love it! It's become our *Cheers*... Great staff and service and an amazing array of *old fashioned* drinks with unique and modern twists"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and I hope it does well...it has a great vibe and the location is great.  They have a dog friendly patio as well.  The cocktails were tasty and the server and owner were very friendly as well."}
