{"text":"First time here. Can't believe we didn't know about this place until now. Very clean, very nice ambience and very friendly staff. Food is awesome with a lot of flavour. Their upside down pineapple cake and baklava are delicious!..  we are definitely coming back here to try the other menu items..."}
{"text":"Very nice, very clean and staff were very friendly and helpful explaining the items to us.   The braised goat was awesome, and the portions on the platters are massive.   I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The best samosas I've had in my life! Try the beef kofta as well very good with the Somalian rice."}
{"text":"This restaurant was really cool.  they have a real modern look and feel to the place.  I had no idea what chicken schwarma was, but I ordered that and the lentil soup.  both tasted excellent.  The manager brought me a side of beef samosas, which were totally awesome.  They were crispy but did not have that deep fried taste.  they were very light and yummy.  The staff was very friendly and it turns out I had the chicken schwarma on pita and it wound up being awesome.  it was like a chicken sandwich with lettuce, cucumber and a nice sauce.  It seemed to be a lot healthier than a friend chicken. sandwhich.  I would definitely eat here again.  I enjoyed the dinner and it is right around the corner from the movie theater, way better than eating at the food court!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times now. Each time the food has been consistently good. The beef kofta is nice and juicy and the chicken kebab has great flavour as well! They also have one of the better shawarma I've had in the GTA area."}
{"text":"Such a great place.  The Food was awesome. We had the chicken swarma which was great and some of the best falafel. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around 1pm on a Thursday. Place was pretty empty. The restaurant is huge with lots of tables. The staff was pretty friendly and helped me out with my order as this was my first time.... And probably my last.   Ordered a chicken sharwarma wrap and chicken shawarma poutine. Both were room temperature/cold. Wrap was slightly warm because they toast the pita. Barely any cheese on the poutine, gravy was cold, hot sauce was tasteless and the chicken barely had any flavour to it.   Lots of other options for chicken shawarma wraps in the area and definitely won't be coming back to this one anytime soon."}
{"text":"Recsntly came across this place amd in it is superb. Food is well prepared and seasoned. Staff is pretty awesome. I go all the way from Brampton and will continue going ISA. 100% recommended."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and excellent food! Try anything on the menu, can't go wrong....I'm from Florida, but I'll be back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to try the food. The dishes is si fresh, tangy and delicious. Tge owner is very friendly and kind, especially detailing the dishes. The price there I think is very reasonable and acceptable.  All I can say is worth dining in."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant I ate at in Toronto. We were invited there by close friends who kept telling us how amazing the place was. The food was awesome and very fresh: juicy grilled meats, aromatic rice, amazing pasta, personal pizzas, refreshing salads. Our group of four shared different plates and we were able to taste many dishes. The restaurant owner and his wife have a popular food blog and boy, do they know about yummy food! They are a very friendly couple who take an active interest in their customers.  The biggest surprise was the chic espresso bar right inside the spacious restaurant. Our group moved from our cozy, comfy booth with touchscreen tablet to the equally comfortable bar stools. We ordered, lattes, cappuccino, and hot chocolate. My wife was blown away by the decadent hot chocolate made from real Belgian chocolates. Forget about powdered chocolate mixes. This here is the real deal.  We were told the restaurant has been open for eight months only and it is already very popular. The hospitality, the food, and the beautiful modern decor is working well for them. It is definitely a place we will visit again and again. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food with fair prices. Not the cheapest but not over priced either. Service was run by what seemed like all teenagers so not the most professional or courteous. Menu was also hard to order off of since it was at the other end of where you place your order. Bathroom stalls in the women's washroom each had a shower head which was odd."}
{"text":"Hidden restaurant in an industrial area, close to the airport. Only came here because of Yelp - there's absolutely no chance of randomly ending up in this plaza. Lots of food choices  at very good prices. We tried the beef samosa, lentil soup w fresh pita and a chicken wrap. All very tasty, and it seemed to be very popular with big families on a Tuesday evening. Service was a bit slow, about 25minutes wait, so come prepared. I don't think we could've found better value and taste in the YYZ vicinity."}
{"text":"Went there on a weeknight with family and had a great experience. The staff is polite and the food is great. Ordered the chicken and beef kofta platter with pasta. The meat was well-cooked and well-seasoned. The pasta was flavorful as well. Overall, it lived up to the hype. My family loved it as well. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I had the chicken shawarma and it was delicious.  You know it's authentic when the majority of the people dinning there are from the middle east / mediterranean region.  If you like Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food, I highly recommend Xawaash."}
{"text":"This is a great example of an awesome place I would never have known about if I didn't have Yelp.  I live in Etobicoke and don't often venture up this way for food but it's really easy to get here.  Right beside Woodbine and not far from the airport.  The place is very modern, clean and inviting inside with Ipads in the booths which you can watch the news or sports on.  We ordered the chicken kebob with rice and salad and OMG it was delicious.  The chicken was very juicy and not dried out like half of the greek/mediterranean/Turkish places in Toronto.  The rice had a distinct spice to it which is different from anything I had previously tried and the salad was fresh.  We also ordered Somalian teas which were different than anything I had tried before and very delicious.  Like everyone else is saying here, you need to try the donuts...I had the nutella filled one and it was warm and packed with nutella.  All in all it was one of the most satisfying meals I've had in awhile and I can't wait to come back and try different menu items.  The owner came up to us while we were eating and asked how everything was and if we needed anymore sauce and was very friendly.  You can tell he cares very much about his business.  If you didn't know, Xawaash also has a food blog/ youtube channel were you can find countless recipes of Somalian dishes as well as Italian recipes and desserts, etc.    Can't wait to come back, such a great Yelp find."}
{"text":"Came from Vancouver to visit my family for Christmas and decided to try something new -- a different cuisine. It was my dads birthday and we wanted to enjoy a good restaurant and came across this wonderful place! I worked as a server and absolutely have never been to a place so good in their service as they are. We ordered very nice dishes with the help of the cashier who was very well informed of the menu and also was so sweet as well as all the other employees at Xawaash. We ate our lovely meal and boy it was worth more than the price they ask! The manager and owner came to our table and made sure everything was going well for us and even served us tea and this magnificent date cake on the house! I absolutely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for hearty food and a warm, friendly environment. If I didn't live in Vancouver, I would come here again and again!"}
{"text":"Xawaash (the x is pronounced like an h) is a large restaurant with a subdued minimalist decor. When you walk in you're directed past a counter separating the kitchen from the dining area. It always boosts confidence in the food when you can observe its preperation.  The restaurant was quite crowded with more groups arriving constantly. The staff were clearly busy but remained friendly and accommodating.  We started out with beef samosa's and some bread that came with a spicy dipping sauce; we also had pita bread along with hummus and baba ganoush for dipping.  We had chicken and beef kebabs as well as shawarma and lamb dishes for the main course along with rice & salad. All the meat was tender and full of flavor. We ended the meal with a cake made using dates. It was very sweet and delicious.  Everything was made fresh.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma lunch special with rice. Food was tasty, good portion and the value ($5.99) can't be beat. Ended up spending more for dessert than for lunch: sticky toffee pudding with ice cream and Somali tea!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Very good spices and good portions. Best food anywhere near the airport. The owner and staff were amazing and accommadating."}
{"text":"If you are in the area this is a must! Very nice menu and wonderfully prepared. We had very little knowledge of middle eastern food and everything was explained brilliantly. Every single thing we had was delicious,and we ordered A LOT of different things including dessert. I can't imagine there not being something for everyone in the menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is very flavourful! Had the chicken kofta with rice and salad- the chicken was slightly spicy, but so juicy and flavourful! The rice was done well, and the salad and tomatoes gave it a refreshing kick. Also shared the beef kofta and pasta with my mom, which was just as juicy and delicious. It's a little pricy, but if you come for the lunch specials it's really affordable.   Definitely the best Somali food I've had in the city. Highly recommend the beef sambusas (samosas) and mahamri, they are made fresh and are so amazing. Will be back to try more of the menu (or just get the same thing as it was so good)."}
{"text":"Great food. Service is efficient. Owner came and introduced himself. Explained the origin of dishes and gave us extra sauce. Such a great place to bring friends who want a new twist on Mediterranean Somalian good."}
{"text":"2.5/5 if I'm being generous.  The food is just all right, no spice, not a lot of flavour in my opinion compared to other Middle Eastern restaurants.The food did come relatively fast after ordering. The staff is made up of really young ppl, I think a lot of them were teens. They made several mistakes with my order. I ordered to eat there and take out. Take out was just a mess. They kept wanting to chitchat with each other, so they would end up ignoring customers. I had to ask for water and then I never got a refill. Improved training and language skills would help."}
{"text":"I rarely rate restaurants on Yelp.  But Xawaash really impressed me.  The mix of spices and flavors in the ful mudammas and chicken kofta were uniquely delicious!  The beef kabobs were tender and tasty.  They make their own pita bread and it was great with the ful mudammas.  Topping dinner off with Somali tea hit the spot on a cold, windy night."}
{"text":"After seeing good reviews for this place on Yelp, I decided to try it! I agree, the samosas are the best I have ever had ! I ordered the chicken shawerma platter! the yellow rice was very tasty,and the chicken as well! It wasn't dry or under seasoned like some places I've been to ! I live in the area, so I'm glad I found this restaurant,!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because it was near our Airbnb and open late. When we got there, it seemed like a take-out restaurant, although there was tons of seating. We ordered the chicken kofta, chicken shawarma, chicken kebab and samosas. We also opted to add hummus and pita for $2 extra. Every single thing we got was AMAZING. The kofta was our favorite. It was so yummy. The total bill came to close to $40 which was an absolute DEAL for our family of 4. We ended up going twice during our 3 night stay -- it was that good! If we are ever back in town, we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Xawaash is one of the best restaurants in Toronto. I love this place. Their food is absolutely amazing and delicious its made fresh which you can taste with every bite. The restaurant has a classy and young feel. The decor is beautiful and the service is great and fast. They also have great customer service. I like that they also have a nice cafe and good desserts. I highly recommend their chai latte with the one of there mouth watering graffe."}
{"text":"Amazing the food was fresh and prepared for us.The owner explained the dishes. And the desserts were Awesome. Staff very cordial we will revisit."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean and tidy restaurant, and the food is great, especially considering the price. The owner was very accommodating and even gave us their most popular dessert, the toffee pudding cake, on the house, for our dinner date.  Will recommend it to those who are in the area."}
{"text":"This place was really special. We found it on Yelp, and thought it would be an appropriate place to host a business meeting with people who had just arrived from Vancouver. I called a day in advance to tell them we were coming, and to make sure they had appropriate vegetarian options.   When we arrived, I was so pleased to find a personalized reserved sign on our table. Every staff person was friendly and welcoming. We aren't terribly familiar with Somalian food (although I had looked at their wonderful, well-established food blog beforehand), so we asked them to select food for us. What a feast! Kabobs (salmon and beef), small pizzas with grilled cheese, and one with beef and spices. Seasoned rice, samosas, hummus, eggplant dip, fresh breads, green salad, the food just kept coming. We stuffed ourselves, and washed it down with yoghurt drinks and iced tea. Everything was delicious, and if you feel adventurous, try the green chile sauce. It had a bite, but the yoghurt and bread cooled the fire.  We saved a tiny little bit of room for dessert, which we shared amongst us. We had an upside-down pineapple cake which was surprisingly good, some baklava, and stuffed doughnuts which were still warm. Seriously. With Nutella.  Above all that, however, was the graciousness of the owner, who came over to visit with us. What a warm, well-spoken and intelligent man. He had so many thoughtful things to say about Somalia, his community, and the world. I learned so much. I'm not in that neighbourhood often, but if I get the chance, I will most certainly go back - with friends!"}
{"text":"Had the Chicken kabob and beef kafta with rice. The rice was not the typical white rice with tomato. It had flavors in it, service was good. I ordered additional rice to go it was partially filled in a bigger box other than that the meat and was flavorful and not dry."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant to have a family meal.  Food is cooked at a high quality here and more importantly it is consistent.    I recommend the chicken kafta and Kabab."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with goat meat and basto. Yes, basto. The mango shake is very refreshing and the date cake is a banger. Casual atmosphere and the employees are pleasant. The owners of the restaurant started a YouTube years ago. The channel is called \"Xawaash Foodblog.\" Glad to see that their restaurant is doing well."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and very clean restaurant.  Ordered the chicken shawarma and rice plate, chicken and beef samosas, and hummus and pita bread.  The chicken and shawarma plate was LARGE.  You can share with this size portion.  The beef and chicken samosas were flavorful and came with a spicy sauce.  The pita bread was hot and fluffy.  Everything was delicious, flavorful and I was stuffed with only half the chicken sharwma plate and sharing the rest of the food with the rest of my party.  Next time we're in Toronto we're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS!! .. the inside is MUCH nicer that I thought it would look from the outside. It is pricey compared to other places that sell this type of food but SO worth it."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give 0 stars... It should not take over 30 mins to get food from a fast food joint. The service is incredible unprofessional and the place is Unorganized. Avoid avoid avoid unless u wanna waste 40 mins of Ur life away being ignored and waiting for cold food."}
{"text":"Mostly good food but terrible awkward service. Got some of our order incorrect, but we had waited so long for our food that we were afraid to ask for it to be fixed."}
{"text":"We went to the establishment during lunch. The restaurant itself was very good and had plenty of seating.   I ordered their chicken shawarma with fries and one beef samoosa. I enjoyed the fries and the samoosa but I didn't enjoy the shawarma that much as it was more like a burger the a wrap.   The service was quick. I would have to try their plates next time.   For my muslim folks - they serve halal food at this location."}
{"text":"Checked it out because of the 4.5 review from 70 people. They were right!  This Middle Eastern - Somali restaurant is north of Toronto's Pearson Airport on ON 27 North.  Hummus was wonderful with just baked, puffy, warm pita bread.  Beef samosa was tasty.  Thin lamb chops were grilled nicely and not tough. Plate came with a bit of tasty lettuce salad and an option to purchase rice for $2 more.  Rice was tender and flavorful with a bit of cumin.  Somali team was efficient but very shy or simply tough to engage. Beautiful pineapple upside down cake.   No filled donuts today. Just baked pita and hummus should not be missed."}
{"text":"First time trying Somalian food, so didn't know what to expect. Was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the beef kofta and chicken kebab with rice. Also had the beef samosas. All really good! It's all very young kids running the store, taking your orders and serving them. So service is a bit slow. But everyone there is super friendly and the place is really clean!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurant I have been to. The food was excellent and atmosphere very welcoming. Somalian origin with Mediterranean inspiration, the food was authentic and full of flavors. Would truly recommend if you enjoy true Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Worse food ever. I order a plate which was barely to see the chicken shawrma on top of rice and oily"}
{"text":"Small but clean restaurant!!! I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. It is middle eastern food with flavors of Indian,  Somalian, Persian....with jalapeño pepper sauce ( Mexican style)!!! Kitchen is quite clean and I was happy that I could see the kitchen from where I order the food. The chicken was perfectly and was very juicy, but beef was little tough and but salty side. Very friendly staff!!! Like the fact that they had many TV screens with pictures of the food so you are fully aware of what you are ordering. As a fast restaurant, price of the food is not cheap but is okay, considering the quality of the food served here. If I am coming to this side of the town again, I will definitely come back. Oh, bathroom was clean, too!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty cuisine, modern and elegant atmosphere.  Came here the other day after playing basketball, and boy did it hit the spot. Ordered the goat meat on race and it was delicious. A little pricey, but the generous portions certainly made up for it. Afterwards, I treated myself to a delectable tiramisu.   Also seems to be family run, and has a great friendly atmosphere. I would come here again. Whether you're looking to expand your tastebuds into Somali / Meditteranean food or just looking for good eats, this place has got you covered!"}
{"text":"The food here is very flavorful! The portion sizes here are so big that you'll have plenty for 2nds and 3rds! Come hungry and leave full! I got the chicken Shawrma platter which came with chicken, rice, and a dressed salad. Will come back here again!"}
{"text":"What is there to eat by the airport?  This is the place to go!  Not really sure what regional food this is - Somalian? middle east?  Mediterranean? Who cares....the food is amazing. Rice is awesome, pasta also awesome, kebab, kofta were deliciously smoky, roast goat is crazy good   Also try the Graffe desert - like a cream filled donut but better!"}
{"text":"We spent 3 hours at this restaurant. And it's not because the service was slow. They recently opened (2 months ago), but the place was packed. They were mostly Somalis, so you know the food is authentic.   We had shawermas, kabobs, rice, hummus, samosas (Somalis do it best)...the food was so good, I didn't pause to take pictures of it! The chicken literally melts in your mouth. We're from Michigan, and the shawerma is better than any shawerma I have ever tasted in Dearborn, which is the Arab capital of America.   And then we saw how they prepared graffe on the menu screen...and they came stuffed in Nutella...so that sealed the deal. They're basically citrusy stuffed donuts. And then we had Somali coffee and tea. The atmosphere was awesome. I've never been to Somalia, but I felt like I was there LOL the owners came out and said hi to us, to make sure the meal went well... They knew we were trying the Somali coffee for the first time, and they offered to give us lattes/cappuccinos/American coffee if we didn't like it. BASICALLY IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT. Also: Brick oven. Fresh bread. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"This place has everything you need: good food, fast service, and it's clean with endless parking !   Location is hidden but easy to find. You walk in and order at the counter. The screens display all the options with clear prices. I went for lunch. For two platters it came to $13!! And when you check in, you get some extra stuff.    The food can take a few minutes to come to your table but well worth the wait. It's fresh !!  I got the chicken platter: you get rice and salad. Pita is extra for 50 cents and I don't mean the rapper!  The owner came to Our table and asked how everything was. He noticed we checked into yelp. He gave additional sampling of the kofta and some dessert. Koftas were amazing. Rice is flavourful. Pita was light and fluffy and warm.  But you need to ask for extra sauce and they are more then happy to serve it.  This place is brand new and squeaky clean!!   Bathroom are super clean with automatic everything: toilet, dispenser and all.   Make sure you go and get your food on !"}
{"text":"I come to Xawaash ALL the time and everyone is usually so friendly. Sometimes it takes a while to get something if you ask but their tables and cool tvs make up for it. I always get their Beef & Chicken with fries and a Shawarma poutine which is AMAZING!   Last time I went the chicken was severely under cooked, usually if its beef I'm okay with it but raw chicken can make you sick. I thought I would approach the owner cause he is usually so nice and welcoming. Unfortunately this is one of the worst restaurant experiences, he said: -they would never serve raw chicken here, it's impossible and he showed me a temperature tool they use -he said he would re-make it and bring it back to us, so no big deal I like the food here so that was okay and that's how a situation like this would normally be handled -he then aggressively approached our table 3-4 times after while we were still eating other dishes to explain that the chicken is \"juicy\" here not raw, you can't overcook chicken or it'll be tough, we must generally eat our chicken dry so we don't know what we are talking about, then the last time he came out of no where (15 min after we complained) with just one piece of chicken in a saucer, with a temperature tool sticking out, he held it up to my face (didn't even put it on the table) and said \"EAT IT AND TELL ME IF ITS RAW\" and im like ahhh.... it's pipping hot and that's kind of rude for you to hold a plate in front of me and yell \"eat it\", he raised his voice while talking to us and was trying to start some sort of argument (with 4 girls), he was definitely causing a scene and our table was very embarrassed -Basically this guy was super offended we didn't like the way he cooked our chicken and harassed us every 5 min after so we couldn't even enjoy the other dishes we had, we asked him for a refund for the raw chicken since 15 min had past and it wasn't re-cooked, we were kind of scared to stay anyways, we walked out and grabbed something else to eat nearby.  I eat at Halal restaurants and I love supporting them but this type of customer service is embarrassing to our community. A normal restaurant would just say sorry about that, have it re-cooked and brought back to the table, a even better restaurant would offer a discount for the inconvenience, and Xawaash wanted to harass and confront 4 girls multiple times to prove that the chicken was raw. I told my family about this experience so we all stopped coming here which sucks cause their food is actually really tasty."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Unfortunately I arrived at busy time and they were overwhelmed. Took a long time to get waited on and to get my food. I think ordered wrong. Chicken kabob was very good but not excellent and there was not much chicken. I wish the platter included hummus. They were also out of doughnuts which depressed me because they have a ton of digital signage advertising them.  They look great. Wish j could have had one. I would go back and hope they would not be very busy because they can't handle a lot of people in their restaurant."}
{"text":"In one word: Yummy!!!  This place is amazing! I got the roasted goat plate and my wife had the chicken kabab. Both plates were very tasteful, especially the goat (my favourite) .  I highly recommend this place if you like kababs and Kabsah.  The have booths with TV for kids. Very nice design. You order first."}
{"text":"A perfect example of Yelp(ers) coming through. I was in the area and quickly needed a bite to eat before an appointment and Xawaash came up on my search.  First, upon entry, the place is quite impressive and very large. It's nicely decorated, including the mural of a Somali proverb near the front. The meal prep area is massive, so you know there's selection galore.  I know little of Somali food, or whether the vast amount of familiar Mediterranean items are ones a part of their cuisine, or if this is simply an aspect of this restaurant. In any case, I went with the beef Kabob on rice platter.  The cashier was very friendly, and great bonus of a free tea or americano with a Yelp check-in. The kabob is cooked to order, and done on an open-flame. The food looked to terrific when it was brought out and they gave me two different hot sauces.  The food was fairly simple - but in a good way, with fresh quality ingredients. The star of the plate was undoubtedly and unsurprisingly the beef. The pic can't quite do it justice, but I received about a half-dozen well-proportioned and perfectly cooked pieces. Excellent quality too.  My basic formula for most 5 star reviews is generally: taste + value. Xawaash met that standard with flying colours, with the free and tasty Somali tea (like a chai) knocking it out of the park. I believe the platter was about $12, and most places would (justifiably) charge around $5 more for the same thing - and it's debatable whether it would even be as good. It really is as good as advertised, since it's very difficult to tell in the Yelp pics which are submitted by a user or the owner.  So much to choose from, but even if the beef kabob was the only item on the menu, it would warrant return visits."}
{"text":"I had to come here and drag my coworkers out when I saw all the 5 star reviews. Yelp has come through on this one, in putting Xawaash on my map for the Toronto hit list. It hits hard on my checklist: 1. Good quality food 2. Unique food options 3. Good prices  My coworkers and I were satisfied with our meals. Everything was hot, fresh and tasty. I saw that they had shawarma poutine fries and had to try it. And it was everything I could hope for in something so uniquely Toronto. It was savory and salty and meaty and seasoned in ways I have never had poutine before. I also tried the samosas, which were flakey, light and filled with meat. One of the best samosas I've ever had.   I have never had Somali food before, but this place opened up my mind to it. Its something to try and not too far off from Middle Eastern food that you commonly see in the GTA. Will be coming back again for another good, quick and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"So tasty!  Had the chicken kafta with rice and hummus.  So full of flavor with a little bit of spice to make the meat truly tasty. Better than the shawarma, which my friend had."}
{"text":"I have never been to Somalia and don't think I will ever go, but I believe that the food at Xawaash was as authentic as you could get near an airport in Toronto.  It appeared to be staffed by Somalis and all of the food seemed to be prepare in house.  They did have some odd menu items like cheesecake and french fries, but maybe they serve those in Somalia, too.  My had a beef kofta wrap that was stuffed inside a pita and then rolled.  Although the pita is baked in house, their attempt to stuff it resulted in an extremely slow speed of service.  I think they would be better off just folding over the pita like most places do.  The kofta was deliciously spicy and generously portioned.  We opted to choose our own condiments which is a little awkward because they needed to call us back up to do so, but the pickled radishes were delicious.  My table mate us sort of a self described falafel freak and he said that the falafel here was excellent.  I have not had falafel very often, but also thought it was very good.  Unfortunately, our sides came out well after we were done with our sandwiches.  The food at Xawaash is easily five stars - house made, fresh, and delicious.  Unfortunately, the service was confused and extremely slow.  The pace of the meal was disjointed.  I initially thought that Xawaash had just opened, but see that is not the case.  If you know what you plan to order and have extra time, then Xawaash is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for lunch with Friends. Came across this place via yelp. The restaurant is easy to spot from the outside. Inside its clean and has all kinds of seating. Amazing food varity from middle eastern plates to fresh made over pizza even ice scream Sunday !  ( unusual for a restaurant of this style to have pizza but it was awesome). Portions were great size too. Prices very fair too. Being the first time we asked about the menu and they spend 10 min explaining and showing everything to us ! Food came out within 10 to 15 min . I would recommend this  place to anyone who is traveling in the area. Will come back for sure !"}
{"text":"Taste really good than I expected, I ordered the beef kofta. However, they don't have price detail on the board"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and wanted a place nearby my hotel to eat and get on with my site seeing. The workers were very friendly. Food came out hot and delicious!! Price was great for the amount of food we got, one plate can feed two people! I'm middle eastern and tried many different restaurants and home cooked meals, 5 stars! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Really nice location. Staff seem friendly and always has lots of customers. The only issue I have is that the pricing doesn't match the quality. Pretty expensive for okay food"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything on their menu is to-die-for, especially their lamb chops and lentil soup. Their staff consistently give all their guests a genuinely heartwarming welcome. We come here all the way from Mississauga, their food and service is unbeatable."}
{"text":"It was not busy when I came. It took them 24 min to have my food ready. I have been asked to sit on a table. Place not so clean.  When my beef kofta and rise  with chicken served from a teenanger which he only moving his head indicating that he understands not a word of English came out of his mouth even when I asked about my forgotten drink, I realize that meat was burn. For several hours after I digest it with a terrible flavors and feelings from my stomach and mouth. Never again..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very clean place with efficient service. Staff is very friendly and above all food is exceptional. Had tired Somoli food long time back but this is by far the best I have had. Roasted goat with rice and lamb chops are must try !!"}
{"text":"Simply put, The food here overall is incredible. We stayed next door for 3 nights and we are here everyday; it didn't feel right to eat elsewhere after we tried it here (it seemed like we'd be wasting a meal eating elsewhere)  We had the following;  Beef kofta sandwich combo      5 stars (addictive)  Lamb chops over rice        4 stars (only since the chops were too thin/small & I personally needed more meat)  Shawarma             5 stars  Beef samosas           5+++ stars :)))  must have"}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Somalian food and now I feel sad that they don't have a location in Los Angeles. Judging by the crowd I can't help but think that everything was quite authentic, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I loved the yogurt drinks and homemade pita and moutabel and grilled lamb. The restaurant was perfectly clean and the staff was friendly and inviting. It could be awhile before I am in Toronto again but I will hopefully be returning to Xawaash someday. I definitely recommend it to anyone that loves middle eastern food as long as they don't mind driving a bit off the beaten path in Toronto."}
{"text":"There certainly are a lot of offerings on the menu. Fettuccine Alfredo, poutine, shwarma... The set up is kind of confusing when it comes to ordering. We had the falafel and chicken kabobs. We were not favorably impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Chicken Kofta, hummus dips fresh pita bread, beef samosa & roasted goat. Another amazing find in Toronto!  Hidden gem off the beaten track. Delicious food, clean restaurant and friendly service."}
{"text":"We had gone t loo Aawash when they 1st I owned and today we are happy to day that the food is still delish. The owner is so pleasant and the desserts ate awesome. We enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices, always busy when I go. Employees are also accommodating too."}
{"text":"Darling (foodie) teenage son found this place on BlogTo and since we were in the area, we decided to try it for lunch. Some lunch specials at $5.99 are a great deal and oh-so delicious too. We ordered the Beef Kofta with rice and salad and the Chicken Kebabs with rice and salad. We could have chosen pasta too. Everything was delicious and well-seasoned.  We've got Somali friends so we were not too surprised by the Italian-style items on the menu. What DID surprise us was the high quality of the coffees and desserts! We tried their in-house Graffes (donuts filled with cream, Nutella or strawberry jam) and Pineapple Upside Down Cake. So much flavour but not overly sweet. Winners!  Looking forward to our next visit. I want to try the lamb shank..."}
{"text":"I cam here the other day to grab some middle eastern food. The food was not the best it was not bad either but thing special i ordered the kabob which decent and chicken tika. What i did not like about the place is the service. The service was very slow which pissed me off as for ever order they took longer than they suppose. Also we ordered a chocolate cheesecake. It came much later than I thought and expected the cheesecake was frozen and hard to eat not tasty at all. They need to serve these things proper. What I really liked about the place is the design and the washroom very moderate and clean although it does not look middle eastern it was nicely designed"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, quite delicious. The lamb shack's taste just wowwww love the atmosphere and all those who work there. Very nice service :) definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I'm usually in charge of ordering catering in for our corporate lunches. I have a regular caterer whom i'm happy about, but was asked one day to order an exotic lunch that serves halal food. I checked Yelp and found Xawaash. I'm glad i did...we had an excel spreadsheet of different types of food preferences for the 30 people in my team, and they all packed everything nicely labelled...and threw in free samosas too! The food was amazing! The only issue i have is they cant deliver as they dont have a debit machine, but hoping they will have one soon...or get a Square so i can order from them more frequently."}
{"text":"Have to say, I was quite disappointed in this place. Happened to be in the area. They advertise both line up and sit down ordering. I know it's confusing. I asked if I should sit down and order to which the cashier replied to order with her. Fine.   Ordered the chicken kebab and beef koofteh.   It was accompanied by rice and salad.   The Meat:  Beef was tender but very salty. Portion in my opinion was about 15% too small.  Chicken was tender but borderline not cooked. Good portion.   The Rice: The rice was very good. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Good portion.   The Salad: Iceberg lettuce chopped up covered in way too much dressing. I'd ask them to take it easy on the salad dressing.   The Service: Ok at best.   The Atmosphere: Nicely renovated place.   Overall, I would go back but I would try something else.  The nice part of having a waitress come to your table is that you can ask questions without feeling rushed while people are waiting after you in line.   Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Still coming here for lunch and I love it  Amazing food. Never been disappointed   Best samosas in town  Great $5.99 lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor experience. Showed them picture of what I wanted and got the wrong item still. Then guy fixed the order but bluntly says we charge extra for this but I'm not charging you. Well damn it I showed you exactly what I wanted, don't give me this nonsense I would of paid regardless. However the sauces were just meh. The food quantity was terrible! You don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Xawaash lives up to all the five star reviews. Everything is amazing from the samosas, breads, main courses, desserts, you name it. Very beautiful and friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Awesome food, I have the beef kofta and chicken kabob with rice and salad. Good was very fresh and the staff was friendly and helpful in describing the the different dishes.  Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto visiting a client whose office is near by this restaurant. When it was time for lunch, he asked me what I wanted to eat. I did a quick yelp search and found this jewel!  My shawarma sandwich was perfect. Done in fresh Mande pita. A little spicy, but not hot. Just awesome.  I also ordered a mango lasi, it was tangy and refreshing.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service. Owners make everything from scratch. They asked if we had tried their Sticky Toffee pudding, when I said we hadn't they offered it to us on the house. Everything was delicious. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The reviews do this place total justice. Had the chicken shawarma sandwich which was delicious. Will be going back often for sure. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yummmmmsville!!! Chicken kebab with the three dips was beyond delish. Nice big windows, wifi, plugs, cozy booths, temperate environment, beverage selection.... top notch place to eat and also to sit at for 3 hours between work sessions or what have you. Yes yes yes yes yes! Thank you."}
{"text":"Very good place to frequent for lunch. Upscale, food is great, customer service is fantastic...  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"AWESOME MEATY SAMOSAS! The food is all around good, but I wanted to comment on the samosas as I think they are the best I've had. I'm a meat eater, but a lot of places only do vegetarian samosas. These guys only do beef and chicken and that's literally all that is in the samosas other than a little bit of onion for flavor. Normally if you're lucky enough to get a meat samosa in another restaurant, it's mainly filled with potato, possibly some peas and then some meat. These babies are ALL MEAT!!"}
{"text":"We had Xawaash cater a company lunch yesterday and the food was fantastic. It was more than enough food for the office and everyone loved the meal. We had: marinated goat and roasted chicken drumsticks (both super flavourful), salad, and a really delicious rice dish with raisins along with a sweet yogurt drink. They also give a variety of sauces.   The food was ready for us to pick up at the appointed time and they even called us to see if we liked the food afterwards. All in all a great experience. When organizing office lunches I just want efficiency and good food at a reasonable price and Xawaash delivered in spades. Definitely would order from them again."}
{"text":"A really excellent meal, again. Tried the felafel dinner: crisp, tender felafel with hummus, hot sauce, and the restaurant's good fresh salad with garlic dressing. Warm homemade bread. Delicious mango juice. The place full of friendly East Africans. Haven't had a disappointing meal here yet."}
{"text":"TIP:  FREE tea/coffee with Yelp check-in!  Xawaash has been \"bookmarked\" for a while, but it's nowhere near where I be (or where I wanna be UNLESS I'm flying out of YYZ), so I finally got here last night.  Maybe I should've gone earlier, when it was more poppin'.  On a Wednesday night, around 5-5:30pm, it was pretty dead.  No one in the large restaurant.    Maybe I was hungry/in a hurry, but the menu just looked like your typical shawarma / ME / Afghani restaurant.  I did a quick scan, but didn't see any pastas or whatever else that sounded \"different\" from their online menu (re:  anjero, mutabbal, sabaayad).  So think:  kabobs, shawarma, kofta instead.  Prices were also pretty comparable to say Watan Kabob.  It was $10+ for a salad/naan dinner platter and about an additional $2-3 for a protein with the rice/fries along with the salad/naan.  However, when I got home, portions were much smaller than any shawarma place that I've been to.  Although it came in a square styro, it was literally 1 flat layer of chicken shawarma and then a row of salad.  Mind you, I didn't finish the whole thing, but portions were still notably smaller than competition.  Tasted fine, sauces were very standard white/red.  Chicken probably wasn't the best quality as it was a bit grisly and somewhat on the drier side.  Customer service was apathetic.  I stood in front of the counter for quite some time, staring at the menu, then standing right in front of the cash register before I was approached in a non-chalant manner.  All in all, food was decent, portions were on the small side, and it seems as though customer service isn't their strong suit.  Nothing really worth driving into this 'hood for..."}
{"text":"I am not Somalian, but maaan!  The food was crazy good. Amazing portions and trust me, I eat more than anyone I know!  We had lamb shank, goat with rice, chicken cutlet, shawarma plate. All of us (are different ethnicities some like spice, some don't) were seriously impressed with the food.   Dessert. Oh my god! They have something called grafe (which we called giraffe jokingly) - basically a awesome tasing bun filled with your choice of topping ( NUTELLLA!, cream pastry, jam)  The service was great, the owner gave us complimentary somalian tea - which was great!!  Look, I don't ever write a review. This is my first. But the food amd service was enough to get me to soend 5 mins :)"}
{"text":"Love xawaash , always tasty no matter what you order. Great staff , great spot freshly renovated . A must for anybody in the area. The chicken kofta is to die for"}
{"text":"This is a popular venue among the local somali community. As you can see, the reviews are raving. Well from my experience of the atmosphere and the food, I can back up the rave reviews. The space is really large and open and everything is quite modern. Something pretty cool is that if you're seated in a booth, you have access to a personal TV where you can watch the news or any other program available. On to the food.   I ordered the beef kofta with rice ($10.49) because its something that I'm really familiar with. It was really good. The kofta was cooked to the perfect temperature making it super juicy. The kofta as well as the rice were very nicely seasoned. The rice was soft and buttery and definitely better than any normal plate of rice.   With the meal, I ordered a mango smoothie ($2.49). I genuinely could not tell whether it was powder or real mango, but I was leaning towards the real stuff. Upon asking one of the employees, I learned that it was indeed made with real mango.   When checking in to yelp, I realized a little bit to late that there is a checkin offer for a free coffee or tea. I presented it to the employees but none of them seemed to have a clue about it. Perhaps the business owner should have let the employees know that this was happening. Not a big deal, I ended up receiving the tea anyways. It was a good end to the meal."}
{"text":"Meat is cook fresh when you placed order! So wait is a definite, but you get your food tasty and hot! Great food, great staff! Place your order by the counter, and find yourself a clean table. Definitely worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is huge with lots of seating. The place is very neat and clean, the staff are very nice, and the menu has a huge variety.  I ordered the falafel sandwich. It was in a different type of bun or pita that you usually get it in. Maybe it's a Somalian type. I don't know.  But the falafel was very earthy. It didn't taste good, and they didn't fill it right. All the lettuce and sauce was at the bottom so when you bite into it you don't get the flavors until you get to the bottom.   They have a vast menu and it looks very appetizing, so I hope to return one day to try something different.  Perhaps then I will be able to raise the amount of stars.   I would recommend this place, just not the falafel."}
{"text":"Amazing food ... but customer service is really really bad ... girls in the cashier has no manner"}
{"text":"Been here twice never been disappointed ! Excellent customer service and food ! Always so fresh ..... Love the open kitchen concept !"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I always get the shwarma dinner with samosas. They serve meat samosas - which are delicious. I prefer the beef over the chicken.  Price is high compared to other Sharma restaurants; however, the food is great, so I have made this my go to spot.  Service is a little slow, but sometimes it's justified."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Xawaash on our way back home from another place that did not work out. Walked in to a large dining area with multiple tables and booths. The order counter could be described as cafeteria style, pay at cash and walk down the line, however, if you dine in, they will serve it to you at your table.   While in rome (somalia in this case), I wanted to try something authentic, I ordered the Suqaar Beef with somali rice as an extra side. It was quite tasty and the portion size was very generous. One thing I realized afterwards was the dish is described as pan-fried beef strips with peppers and onions, but there were no peppers anywhere in the dish, the pictures do show green and red bell peppers. Despite the mishap, it was still very good and I would go back and try more dishes, this time I will pay attention to what should be included.   On the downside, the dining space is large and very open, with the coffee machine going, it was extremely noisey to the point where I could not hear myself talk. You don't realise how loud it is in there until you get outside and your ears are ringing! Gave me memories of my ears adjusting outside after a rock concert."}
{"text":"We decided to try some local ethnic fare by Pearson Airport. We were visiting from Detroit and staying at one of the nearby hotels.   This is a small unassuming corner restaurant. If there is a clear sign that a restaurant is good, look for an indigenous crowd. In this case: Somalian patronage. And there were a lot of Somali families here!  You order and pay up front at the counter. It can be for take out or dine it. If you dine in, like we did, they bring your food out in unassuming but huge portions! Everything comes on trays, ala cafeteria. Simple but effective!  The Muufo, a soft triangular bread, was super delicious! So were the samosas. Rich, full flavor that is shockingly good.   We tried the chicken kofta, chicken shawarma and braised goat. The flavors were rich and delicious! In fact, almost everything was universally tasty.   We would recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of middle-eastern type food because this Somali restaurant serves a lot of that type of fare plus others all their own. We were very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Tasty food but bad service, unfriendly staff and portions are small especially for what you have to pay! Not coming back"}
{"text":"We were really hungry, so that might have added to the stars as well; but honestly speaking, a truly Somalian restaurant that reminded me of my childhood Somalian friend's mother's cooking. The staff was really courteous, I might add that one of the cleaning boys was clicking the plate a bit too much while cleaning, but he did apologize for it, and I think the overall ambiance of the restaurant overcame it. We ordered the family platter with goat, beef kebabs and rice and spaghetti. The food really was to die for."}
{"text":"Different from the usual Mediterranean place  Has a little Somali touch to it. Makes it different in a good way. Flavorful food, good ambience Wouldnt mind going there again for a casual meal"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a small plaza, near the Mazda dealership. There are plenty of seats, and the tables are accompanied with lcd touch screens. The washrooms and tables are very clean."}
