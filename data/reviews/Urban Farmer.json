{"text":"Stopped here before the browns/ravens game at the place was a mad house.  We managed to get a seat at the bar for drinks and brunch.  Cool vibe.  Jeff served us and was absolutely amazing considering how completely overwhelmed the bartenders were. He made our pregame experience awesome by making us laugh like crazy while giving us quick service.  Even made us some interesting drink that my wife's friend saw him make for a server; I think it was a zazerac.  We had the pancakes, avocado benedict, and French toast and a side of bacon.  All were great!  Nice sized portions I might add.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I took some customers here for lunch and it was amazing.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  I think everyone was very happy with their meals.  It was nice for lunch because even with six people, we got in and got out in a timely manner so that everyone could get back to work.  I would definitely rush back!"}
{"text":"I'm waiting for 45 minutes for my breakfast while people next to me come 20 minutes later got their food  already in 20 minutes and the waitress said the kitchen cooked differently so depending what your order. I looked next to me they order not much different then what I ordered.
So if they're is a mixed up they should explained truthfully not lying to customer. Really bad customer impression. Good is not great either! They're the same as crocker barrel food!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch: awesome! Everything fresh & unique. Great atmosphere & another example of Cleveland's incredible food scene. Best eggs Benedict I have ever had."}
{"text":"BEWARE! Do not use your credit card at this restaurant!!!! After our not so great experience with the restaurant( poor service and ok food) the server decided to help herself to a $25.00 tip on our credit card unauthorized! We left cash on the table for her so she filled in the tip amount herself. I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the server and  was told I could not. I asked for the manager , explained the situation, she looked up my receipt and confirmed the server had indeed wrote in an unauthorized tip. Through my initial call it became apparent this has happened at this restaurant before.  The manager said she would have the GM call me the next day. I waited until 7pm and then called again. I reached the GM and he mostly wanted to tell me how he had been traveling and was trying to catch up. I explained what had happened and was again told I would be called back. After a few more calls and aggravation they eventually offered to reimburse the $25.00 to me if I gave them my credit card information over the phone to them. I think I will go pick up my cash , not trust them with my card again."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse I've ever been to. I had the four steak sampler, awesome!  The charred octopus appetizer was delicious.  The Blondie butterscotch sundae was the single best tasting dessert I've ever eaten,  truly amazing! !"}
{"text":"First time visit for brunch on 10-30-16. We both enjoyed a Farmers omelet each, shared fruit bowl and shared order of bacon. My husband had fresh squeezed orange juice and we both had coffee. The food was fantastically fresh, tasty and well presented. The only reason I did not give five stars is because I had to ask for a server after we were seated and folks seated after us had a server first. This is a pricy place for breakfast food (tab was nearly $60) but  don't we all deserve special now and then? Also, very cool that Urban Farmer is adjacent to the Westin hotel."}
{"text":"Recently walked in with a friend for lunch. Person inside the door says welcome. I then say could we get a table for two for lunch. As Im saying that Im looking around and notice the are several open tables with no one waiting. They then ask if I have a reservatiion. I reply no. The other interesting thing is that its around 12:45. They offer us a seat at the bar for full service. We were dressed casually but not badly. I truly felt we were denied a table due to not looking the right way. 

Ive actually eaten there several times including once during the Republican Convention and thats why I came back. But this time I found somewhere else to spend my money. Have enough good choices without being insulted."}
{"text":"If you have ever wanted to experience a New York nightclub you can get that in Cleveland.  Unless you are on the list / reservations, they will not seat you.  More than half the tables are empty and they force everyone to sit on couches or at the bar.  Like other posts, the couch section is understaffed and you will wait for service.  I did notice many workers standing on the side of the bar talking.  They actually handle the empty tables in the dinning room.  The food was just OK and it took 15 minutes to get a bloody mary."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here and let me say it was nothing short of fantastic. It was a simple breakfast of eggs over medium with the most fantastic fennel sausage. Not greasy. Very flavorful and lean. I would also have to say their version of \"salsa\" is a savory firework for your palate. Oh! And one more thing! The English muffin will change. Your. Life. Good stuff. Stay tuned for a dinner review."}
{"text":"Great experience eating breakfast here on Saturday morning!!! We were a party of 10 people.  Everyone got something different and everyone was very happy.  The atmosphere is so uniquely charming.  I will definitely be back! Want to try the Bloody Mary bar next time.  Fresh&special!"}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant and the hostess immediately asked if we had a reservation. No \"hello\" or \"welcome\" from her. We said no and that there was just 2 of us. She said it would be an hour wait. Earlier we had called asking if they were still serving brunch. They said yes. Maybe they could've noted the wait or that we needed a reservation when we called. When we told her that she could have told us about the wait on the phone, or to make a reservation, she said that it wasn't her fault that we didn't make a reservation. Not only were we treated like uninvited guests at a private party, but the initial customer service was rude and demeaning. We have no care or interest to go back.

Manager contacted me and wished to make it up to me. Very nice of them to reach out."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the city of cleveland!!!!!! French toast is amazing!!!! Oatmeal is off the hook!!!!!!!! I swear this is the best breakfast in town !!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice. Always a great meal and atmosphere!  Love the cheddar biscuit for breakfast!
A special place we will always return to when in town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!
Very Friendly staff but need time to get the links out. 
Had the lobster omelet Yummy $18 served with potatoes just alright and whole wheat toast was amazing"}
{"text":"Ok this place presents well but don't fall for it. Still waiting for my brunch food about an hour later. Multiple requests for things and no apologies."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant located in the westin hotel in downtown cleveland . Delicious food and cocktails! Don't listen to the negative reviews . I read the negative ones , and it sounds like those people complain at all the restaurants they go to ! Cheers to the best hotel restaurant  in Cleveland! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Urban Farmer in over a year, but in that time nothing has changed: Urban Farmer still serves top notch, high quality food.

The bread they serve here is soooo good. I don't remember it being that good last time, or even receiving bread last time. You get a freshly baked roll of cornbread and two sweet wheat buns. I normally try to avoid bread at restaurants so I don't fill up, but I couldn't resist these. 

We started off with the yellowtail crudo and the foie gras. The yellowtail crudo was served with grapefruit, jalapeños, and cilantro. I avoided the jalapeños at all costs, so my perfectly composed bite consisted of the crudo, grapefruit, and cilantro. Perfect combo. Everything tasted incredibly fresh, one of the perks of most ingredients being sourced from local farms. 

The foie gras was served with a lemon cherry jam, cornbread, and prosciutto. The lemon cherry jam was sweeter than I expected, and less tart/acidic. It would be a great accompaniment to a charcuterie board. I really enjoyed the prosciutto and foie gras combo. The prosciutto added even more to the savory aspect of the dish and complimented the foie nicely, not too overpowering. Good, but not our favorite interpretation of foie.

For our entree, we split the grass fed New York strip. Cooked perfectly. Cooked with the perfect amount of butter and seasoning. In each bite you a blast of flavor. Very tasty. We had our steak with the brussel sprouts. I was weary of ordering a side here because last time we had, the sides were HUGE. And I mean gigantic. This time around they seemed like they had shrank, which I am not complaining about. Highly recommend. 

I was hesitant about getting dessert because I felt good, not too full or gross, but I couldn't stop thinking about the date cake I had seen on the dessert menu, so we went for it. Great choice. One, you can't even taste the dates, so don't let that stop you from ordering it. Two, it was the perfect size, not obscenely large. And three, it was so incredibly moist and delicious. The toffee sauce was a really nice touch. Again, highly recommend. 

Only complaint? The apathetic food server who literally looked like he hated his job and didn't want to be there. Girl, bye!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! PRICEY and EXTRAORDINARILY SMALL PORTION SIZES. 
I got a Brussels Sprouts Salad that cost me $12. I ordered out so I didn't open my container until I got back to my office. I was shocked at how different what I imagined the salad to be in the online lunch menu per the description. 

Description: \"Brussels Sprouts, chicory, apple, squash,  cured egg yolk\" 
What I got was 15-20 max individual BSprouts leaves vs. whole BSprouts, no squash, 4 very thin (potato chip thin) apple slices, 4 very small and thin slivers of what looked like chicory leaves and 3, what seemed to be rice grain size, egg yolk. There was no squash. And I can't say this salad blew me away - it was covered in dressing and everything had wilted. 
BTW, my coworker ordered a burger for only $2 more! 
This was the 2nd chance for UF despite how disappointing my first experience was - all veggie soup and salad and a burger for my friend for about $55 with tip AT LUNCH. 
I am NEVER returning here. I suggest that,  unless you have extra cash to spend, there are other superior quality restaurants that serve much better food for much less."}
{"text":"Food is great. Don't come to sit on the patio during the day unless you want a sunburn. No shade at all."}
{"text":"We went for brunch- kids were very welcome and they do have a kids menu so I'm not sure why it is designated as no kids. The shrimp and grits were fabulous as was the shaved ham Benedict. Beautifully plated. Everyone really enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"My first time in Cleveland this past weekend, visiting from Toronto for the Raptors vs Cavs  and we stayed at the adjoining Westin Hotel. I would like to say that the reviews for the Westin hotel should be looked at separately from this restaurant when grading this place. 

So we came for breakfast and dinner here, so two separate experiences both which were positive. Firstly, this place is done beautifully inside. Our waitresses for both breakfast and dinner were extremely polite and a pleasure to talk to, service was great all around. 

As someone who is both health conscious and enjoys local, organic, and non GMO food that is also delicious and done beautifully I have to say this place hit all those nails on the head. Being from Toronto we are used to concepts like this but this place was even better than several steakhouses I've been to in Toronto and since this is connected to a hotel and serves breakfast and lunch I would rebook at the Westin in the future if I ever return to Cleveland simply for this place. We were recommended this place by someone else too. 

Anyways for breakfast I had the panna cotta greek yogurt with berries, granola and a cute little biscotti on top, and a side of some toast, eggs, and some sausages which I believe had caraway seeds in them or something.  For simple breakfast food I was impressed, everything was fresh and the sausages and panna cotta greek yogurt were standouts. They had a pretty extensive breakfast menu and everyone else at my table enjoyed their meal as well. A plus was when they bring you tea you also get a cute little jar of local honey as well for your tea. 

Now for dinner. The vibe totally changed at night and had a great feel. Place was completely packed by 6 so make a reservation. Now since this place is a steakhouse at heart and definately in the expensive side expect to pay more but you pay for what you get. One of the best meals I've had in awhile. The waitress did a great job at explaining the different cuts of steak. Even the less expensive corn fed steaks (I think the cheapest was 36) are fed non GMO corn. I had the waitresses recommendation of an 18oz bone in 21 day dry aged steak that was grass fed and corn fed the last 30 days, done between blue and medium rare because I like a very rare steak. Absolutely amazing is all I can say. Like butter. Cooked perfectly. The people I was with all had different steaks, grass fed, corn fed, and they were all cooked perfectly. I should begin by saying we all started with salads and they were EXCELLENT. I had a greens salad with crunchy quinoa, and I believe different cuts of radish and it was so fresh. All of our salads were excellent. 

I should have started by saying that we had the restaurants fromagier come over after the waitress recommended a cheese sampling. We picked 3 different cheeses to sample from 5 he presented which were OUTSTANDING. I believe one was a Romano, a brie and also a more runny goat cheese which was delicious. They were played beautifully with honey, preserves, crackers, apricots and raisins. I forget his name but he was so pleasant and knowledgable so if you love cheese definately request the fromagier. 

We had 3 sides as well, the Mac and cheese, an apple and squash dish and a mashed potato dish all of which were excellent. After dinner we were extremely full but I shared a panna cotta which was delicious and thankfully done differently than the greek yogurt breakfast version! Now definately an expensive meal but wow was it ever amazing. The previous night we went to another steak house down the street and the quality can't even compare. 

OH and I almost forgot that the cornbread and whipped butter they bring you for free was hands down some of the best cornbread I've ever had!!! Hot and moist and  just fall apart. OMG is all that describes the corn bread. 

If you are in Cleveland I would suggest staying at the Westin for this place alone. And if you want some amazing steak I think this is probably the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was atrocious! Staying at hotel and enjoyed delicious Bloody Marys, brioche French toast and omelette. However, our table was never bussed (they sat is outside and it was dirty, both the hostess and our waiter said it would be bussed immediately). Had to ask for silverware three times, water never refilled, had to ask for coffee refill two different times, waiter not once asked how our meal was. Oh - and he took our order once, and then a few minutes later returned and asked if we were ready to order. And they weren't even busy. Again, the food was delicious but the poor service a total turnoff."}
{"text":"not typical hotel dining.  the food was exceptional.  the rib eye steak melted in your mouth; my favorite was the salad.  how can you get excited about salad?  just try it.  very, very fresh and sooo good.  green beans, creamy, but pricey at $11.00;  It was fun to watch the chef prepare a 5 piece dish.  I do not know the name and it consisted of food I was unfamiliar with.  The server was very knowledgeable and her suggestions were 100% on target.  I doubt we will return due to the price, $140 without dessert.  But for those don't mind paying $140 for dinner for two and like to try new restaurants, give it a try.  This could be the going rate for new, trendy Cleveland restaurants.  PS  wine was very pricey."}
{"text":"Our wedding party had a brunch reservation for 11 am. The staff held enough tables for our party but the hostess refused to seat us all at the same time since it would \"overload the kitchen.\" Even after we told her that we could simply wait a few minutes before we ordered, to make it easier, half of our party had to stand in the waiting area, watching while the rest of our party sat and ordered - even though there were clearly open tables that were being held specifically for our party. 

Been waiting 1 hour to sit at tables that have been prepared and held for us. We can see our tables but cannot sit at them. 


This makes no sense and were we not with a wedding party, we would have left.

Zero stars if it were possible."}
{"text":"Went there last night with a friend.  Maybe because of all the good reviews, I expected more.  We split the New York Steak Tasting with the Wagyu (grass fed, prime, 21 day aged).  We asked for it to be done somewhere between medium rare and medium.  Three of the steaks were all medium to medium well, and two had a lot of gristle (chewy). Should have sent them back, but didn't.  The best tasting one was actually the dry aged.  Wouldn't pay the extra $30 for the Wagyu.

The corn bread was as yummy as everyone said... we even got seconds on that!  For sides, we ordered the roasted brussel sprouts and the twice baked fingerling potato tart.  The brussel sprouts were ok, but the potato tart was amazing!  That was the best thing we had.  It was delicious.

For dessert we split the maple cheesecake.  We are both maple lovers and the maple flavor didn't seem to come thru much.  It was just ok.

Service was excellent.  Our waitress was very attentive and informed...as well as pleasant and fun.

For the two of us, with only coffee to drink, the bill was over $160.  yikes!  Definitely not worth $160 for 2.

I think we're going to try this again, but for restaurant week...."}
{"text":"Earlier this evening, my boyfriend and I left Newsies and decided to go to Urban Farmer to enjoy these mushrooms they serve as a side. We got there around 4:30 only to be told that the Lounge menu was being served and the mushrooms were on the dinner menu, which did not begin until 5pm. So, we decided to make a reservation for 5pm, and wait in the lounge.

So, 5pm arrives, and we are seated. Our waitress was a woman named Jen. We immediately order two sides: mushrooms and some type of potato tart. When we told her we were only interested in sides, her entire demeanor changed.

She took the menus, dropped off some bread, and stormed off. We waited 30 minutes for our sides, during which time she did not come to check on us once. Our sides came our and they were great! Finally she decides to come back.

We were so disgusted by her attitude, we finished our sides and immediately asked for our check. We tipped her for the sake of good manners, but we will not be returning. This was our second and last time here. It is worth noting that we saw the people that refilled our water glasses more often than our own server. What a shame..."}
{"text":"I visited Urban Farmer twice last weekend while celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  We stayed at the Westin, which is attached to the restaurant.  Our first visit was on a Saturday night for a nightcap... the place was pretty busy, but had relaxed feel.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and attentive which meant a lot since she was slammed.  Our next experience was brunch there the next morning... even better!  We had some sides to start-hockey puck sized hash brown, shrimp, and brussel sprout salad which were all very good.  My boyfriend got a burger and loved it.  I consider myself a foodie and don't get excited easily...  I got the avocado eggs benedict and fell in love!!!!  It was so incredibly amazing that I could not stop raving about it and will return to Urban Farmer for it every time I'm in Cleveland!  Great place with great food and employees."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I was totally impressed with the decor and was looking forward to the food.  I have been here twice now for their brunch and have left happy.  The food is delicious and the portion size is more than substantial.  The manager and waitresses that I have encountered are friendly and considerate.  I have tried the flat iron steak and eggs dish as well as the two eggs any style (scrambled) dish with chopped ham, potato and English muffin.
Both dished were delicious.  The steak was cooked right (med rare) and the eggs are fluffy and buttery.  Both times I've ordered the homemade English muffin.  The first time, however, I wondered if we could order jam with the muffin but forgot to ask the waitress.  The second time I was glad to see the waitress brought jam, butter, ketchup and other accoutrements to the table.  The English muffin was huge, warm and delicious.  Also the potato side thing (can't remember the name!) is hands down my favorite!
During my first breakfast here the waitress brought us a small plate of fresh baked goods (blueberry mini muffin, scone and something else).  This was such a nice offering and the blueberry muffin was great.  Perfect for my little guy who was eager to eat.  During the second breakfast visit, I was sad to see no small plate of baked goods.  I asked the waitress for a small piece of bread for my little guy while we waited for our food bc it was a little while, and she did bring us something which was great.  Have to say that the blueberry mini muffins were great and hope to see them on the menu in the future.
Overall I have enjoyed this restaurant and will come back not only for breakfast, but to try lunch and dinner.  It is very accommodating to families with children and it is nice to eat at a lovely restaurant with great quality food from local sources."}
{"text":"If you are looking for grass fed beef then this should be first on your list.  Apps are phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"I love the setting in downtown Cleveland. Had a very nice feel to it. 

I had a 14 ounce Bartels ribeye. While it was flavorful, it was much tougher than I expected. Cooked a perfect medium, but I was disappointed in its definite lack of tenderness. I had to work at it a little too much. For the money - pricey - I expected better quality.

Mac and cheese as a side was very good.

Service was excellent. 

Yeah, I would try again. One day I will. Just not right away."}
{"text":"The first taste of Urban Farmer's fabulous decor is outside - cleverly stenciled re-purposes barn siding adorns the building. The decor in this place is fabulous: a sprinkle of industrial and a mix of henhouse and country cellar is fused together with in a funky, urban farmer vibe. How clever!

Our group of six for Sunday brunch was quickly sat and waited upon by a delightful waitress who was attentive and informative at every turn. 

We started with a cheese plate and fruit - as much of it locally sourced as possible. The Middlebury blue cheese was mild and delicious, the Asiago appropriately crystal-ly and there was a cheese - we never did find out the name - but a cheese so stinky that no middle school boys locker room could emulate. Our outstanding server quickly removed it from our table after we established it did not fit our palate.

Onto an avocado Benedict for me and a flat iron steak for my husband. The avocado Benedict sat atop a homemade English muffin that was truly delicious, and a meal in itself. Consider splitting this dish as it is heavy and filling. I couldn't even make it through one muffin and egg combo. My husband said the steak was an excellent cut of grass-fed meat and was prepared well. His only comment to improve the dish was the minimal seasoning on the meat. \"Perhaps because it is breakfast\" he said. 

Prices were decent; portions were large and the fresh squeezed juice was just the thing to cure the prior eve's poisons. Enjoy Urban Farmer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch before going to the rock and roll hall of fame. We asked our hostess what she recommended and she didn't hesitate and recommended the French toast and bacon as a side. Usually my husband and I try to order different meals so we can try more items on the menu but we couldn't resist ordering the same because it sounded so yummy. We were not disappointed, our meal was amazing! Huge portion size and the hazelnut butter was delicious. 
Want to go back again soon!! 
Our best brunch in a long time!! 
Yippee!!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Westin for a conference and went to Urban Farmer 3 days in a row for breakfast. The service was horrible. Every time we arrived there was no one at the hostess stand. Once we were finally seated we were always greeted by a rude waitress. Our food came out wrong all three days making us late to the the conference. Save yourself the grief and find another place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We have been to Urban Farmer twice and both times we had a great meal.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant has great decor (for all you out of towners who are surprised to find a cool, hip restaurant in Cleveland- don't be!  We have lots of amazing restaurants that compare favorably to Chicago and New York)  On both occasions we were seated promptly and service was excellent.  I particularly love the focus on local food and found that the staff is very well informed and can talk knowledgeably about the offerings.  On our first visit my husband had the octopus appetizer and said it was excellent.  I chose two cheeses off the cheese cart (which is just okay- the cheese cart at Edwins is far superior and worth the trip!).  We both had steaks and they were excellent (but honestly, I didn't find them superior to the steaks at Red, Hyde Park, etc.).  We usually don't order dessert, but as it was our anniversary we did- the caramel sundae for me (heaven!) and the apple cider doughnuts for my husband (also delish).  On this last visit, I had a Caesar Salad (overdressed and with too much parmesan cheese) and the salmon (perfectly done and served with an amazing onion couscous).  My husband also had excellent fish and our son had the steak sampler (three 6 oz steaks- most of which came home!)- another very good meal.  This isn't an inexpensive restaurant but the ambiance, locally sourced and produced food and service justify the cost.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"First, the place is just cool!

And then the food started coming out.  The Local Green salad was awesome!  The tenderloin (grass fed) was unreal.   I have always loved XO and still do but the food here was crazy good.  

We had the mac and cheese side which could have held its own as a meal itself and the potato puree which was equally as good.

The service was excellent especially given it was their 2nd night open.  Food was out quick which is great for someone who doesn't enjoy the marathon steak dinners.

We dug the place so much we stayed for a drink at the bar - Hillary was awesome!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I are on a Steak House quest of late.   We just ate at Red (Downtown Cleve) the week before, and it was wonderful.   Steaks were incredible.   I had read about Urban Farmer and was very psyched to give it a try.   The restaurant itself is beautiful and unique as to décor, etc.     Service was great.   The Sides were very good, especially the mushrooms (a variety of them are included, not just one type).   My son got a $54 Ribyeye and I went for the 21-day aged NY Strip.  Sadly, we were both disappointed.   For the money we spent (More than Red, I might add), they were simply under-whelming.  I could barely tell mine was dry-aged (usually a distinct flavor).  Worse, it was fatty and certainly not a $50 steak.  Same for my son.   Will have to think hard about going again.  Spent $140 before tip, with one glass of beer."}
{"text":"We had a welcome luncheon at urban farmers for 17 people to kick off a wedding weekend. The tenderloin was AMAZING it literally melted in your mouth. Great cesar salad presentation and very tasty. Now for the dessert. OMG I had the butterscotch sundae OMG!!!!! BEST EVER.  Yes it was pricey, yes the portions were not huge, but the taste, service, and ambiance made up for the price and who needs LARGE servings....I thought it was prefect. If I ever get back to Cleveland I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the vibe and service at Urban Farmer.  We went for Sunday brunch on Dec. 31. Hey, it's the holidays but you would not know it from the crew at this restaurant.  The hostess was most unfriendly and cold as the temps outside. The server was inattentive, brought our bloody marys after we had finished our entire meal. The food was so-so. There is nothing to recommend this place."}
{"text":"In town for business. Went based on reviews. Fish was way over cooked. Twice baked potatoes were tasteless. The two stars over one because the service was good. They are working too hard to appear up scale and not covering basic details."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday with my girlfriend for just a quick drink and turned into an excellent lunch. Second time at Urban Farmer and sat at the bar. We ordered a couple bloody marys. The bartender mentioned if we wanted to add anything to our drinks we could walk over to the bloody mary bar.....lots of selection to choose from.  We ordered the burger and the chicken sandwich and both were dynamite. We chose the fries and fresh fruit to accompany our sandwiches. This place is very cool, food and drinks awesome and the service both times was great."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Service is good, local wine selection was good however $60 42 day age steak cooked to medium rare as ordered but not tender and lacked flavor.  Side of mushrooms dry and a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"visiting Cleveland with my husband from California, we stumbled onto this place. the food was AMAZING!! better than the food was the service, Dar and Ellen, provided first class service. I had the New York my husband had the Rib Eye, we split a Caesar salad and we split creamed spinach and Mac and Cheese all top class.  We truly enjoyed talking with both ladies, they made our night. thank you."}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere and delicious food. We came in for lunch with my family on Labor Day weekend solely for some Bloody Mary's (they weren't the best but better than regular). The food was good and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Rack of lamb, mushrooms, Brussels  sprouts, and coconut macaroon ice cream. It was all really heavenly! I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing dinner. The Ohio Wagyu steak was so tender and made exactly like we wanted it. The creamed spinach was the best we have ever tasted! We started with Local Greens Salad!! It was so fresh and the dressing was perfect! Also enjoyed the homemade Oxtail Soup! What a great evening in a great place. Michele, our server took excellent care of us! Will go there again when we return to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally pretentious, and borderline rude. We were very disappointed in the food. It was a great example of mediocre, and greatly overpriced,  \"Re-imagined\" comfort food (brunch menu).  From my experience, restaurants attached to hotels, as this one is, tend to be overpriced and not that impressive. The Urban Farmer lived up to that reputation. I wouldn't go back even if it were free.  Yes, really.  We were that unimpressed.  It was really hard for us to even understand why at the time we visited, this place had a four star review. Nothing about our experience team anywhere close to four stars.  Skip it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch.  We loved the complementary homemade parker rolls and the club sandwich.  Friendly service and nice farm-to-table atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice bar / bartenders.  Good service overall, and the hostesses were very accommodating.  Portion size is small, and the price is too high.  Best thing of the night is the Charcuterie plate.  That was 5 stars.  My overdone filet, however, was the size of my big toe.  Not 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever eaten (I am 60), served on home made English muffin,  bacon was crisp and thick,  home chips were wonderful $18! Service was prompt and friendly"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try... Looking for something a little different while in Cleveland for business. Note that Google maps tries to put you about a half block from the restaurant - its actually in the hotel building. 
My companion had the Walleye dish and I had a Flank Steak. The fish was ok... Not great. The steak was cooked perfectly... But was tough. For the price point this place is on the scale, I expected more."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  It was delicious.  My husband and I both loved our meals.  I had the brioche blueberry French toast and he had a frittata.  We ate at the bar since they were all filled up with reservations even though the restaurant was nearly early the entire time it took us to eat and leave.  We would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. The food was great, the Mac and cheese is a must have. Just be prepared it cost way more than we expected. Love that the restaurant supports local farmers. The cornbread was so good!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is the house made pastrami - with beef tongue or some shit - is absolutely insane. I'd go just to eat that."}
{"text":"Food is very good!  The chicken cherry sausage is very tasty and the English muffin is huge. The service was just below average...the waitress never came back to ask if everything was good and did not offer any refills. This was my third visit here and the food has been consistently good and the service poor."}
{"text":"This hot new joint inside the Westin hotel is a dream for locals and visitors alike.... Not to mention meeting/event planners (me). 

This restaurant is fresh and new and offers comfortable and healthy options without the intimidating menu. They have a unique flare for decor and have found a practical way to adorn the walls with local touches. 

Local and sustainable is the name of the game- from food, to inspiration, to decor, and people!! (Many of which have since relocated back to the revamped area). The flavors to the menu are dish- try the shrimp Caesar! 

I have been here for lunch (love the comp valet) and a social on the patio (not too much outdoor dining in this area, so it's great!) 

Great spot- home run for the hotel and surrounding area! Cheers!"}
{"text":"It is surprising how you can't find a good steak anymore unless you are in New York or Las Vegas. Urban Farmer poses as a purveyor of fresh and farm raised, but they fall far short of what I think should be locally sourced meat and produce. Cleveland folks are smarter than that and look forward to a great meal when they party out."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal with the perfect glass of wine. The roasted mushrooms side dish and the creamed spinach gratin side dish are both simply dreamy! 
The service was impeccable - our server knew SO much about the various steaks and the differences between them. Nothing was overlooked - so perfect'"}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. My boyfriend and I got the New York steak tasting with the 6oz Wagyu add on. We ordered our steaks medium and after cutting into our steaks they were extremely rare and almost cold in the middle. We had to send them back and have them cooked further. Once the steaks were cooked properly, we tried them and they were some of the fattiest cuts of meat we've ever had. ESPECIALLY, the tenderloin. This was all together once of the more expensive meals I have had for the worst quality meat at a steak restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Urban Farmer a few times  over the course of my travels to Cleveland and although it was one of my favorites a few months ago over the last six to eight months it's dwindled in appeal to me.. not to say that the overall feel isn't still good it's just not as great as it used to be... I will give it another shot for dinner and Cocktails but brunch is a no-go for me.. many other places just around the corner do some pretty good brunch specials !"}
{"text":"Everything was good but way over priced. I've eaten at many different steak houses in the area and nothing special about the steaks at this place except for the cost.

Yelp lists this place as $$, needs changed to $$$$$."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing! If you go here for brunch with a sweet tooth, get their brioche french toast with the vanilla yogurt panna cotta--so good. The brioche comes drizzled with maple syrup, fresh blueberry compote, and hazelnut butter with actual chunks of nut melted on toasted homemade bread. The yogurt is homemade, whipped so it's light on the tongue, and comes with a top layer of oatmeal, piece of biscotti and a few berries.

For those with a savory tooth, the avocado benedict and red flannel hash are also a good pair. The red flannel has a flavor punch that complements the mild benedict. A secret dish that apparently not many people know about is their sunchoke and celery root soup--the server pours the soup over browned morels and fresh celery root and leaves for you to mix in. The flavor is unique and delicious--wish we'd have gotten some of their stone oven bread to dip in.

Also service was excellent and coffee here is fresh, hot, and so smooth!"}
{"text":"3 out of 3 meals went back and still no manager bothered to come over to our table,  still waiting...

Second round of food was just awful and still no manager

Finally gave up, had the French toast and left."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Westin. I had two lunches here, both very good. The staff was accommodating and friendly, although the server brought four tiny rolls for a table of six. Different people delivered the food, leading to my pet peeve -- a server standing with armloads of plates, querying, \"WHO HAD THE TURKEY?\" while interrupting all conversations.

The menu changed to a more limited brunch menu on the weekend. Lucky for me, the shrimp and grits was still available, so I got to enjoy a plate of grits, moist grilled shrimp, *and* pulled pork, with a poached egg to top it off. 'Nuff protein there!

One wall is lined with gorgeous jars of canning and preserves, which a server told us the chef makes herself. Having grown up with home canning I have to wonder where she finds the time. And it's not just decoration - they serve this homemade good stuff. Very cool."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Caesar salad was about 5 bites for $13. The cost is closer to $$$$ than the $$ shown on Yelp"}
{"text":"This is an undeserved 1 but I had to give them something...ask the for the happy hour menu because it's not offered and know your getting a non-salted dry slider on the happy hour menu! Disappointed that Westin is carrying this restaurant and giving them undeserved business! Servers and bartenders are not sure what's going on or when the shift changes and who is coming and going! Nothing we ordered was even remotely right and the ladies beside us received our food and we got theirs...not exactly our plan...I doubt the women wanted oysters...OVER PRICED! Try the Up-Beet if you have to go!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for brunch for a couple visitors from Chicago.  We saw there were a number of good looking brunch options, and I'd be interested in seeing how they stack up to Urban Farmer cuz it was awesome.  Their lunch and dinner menus look great too, and look forward to trying those in the future.
 Now, I could nitpick because our bartender forgot a couple of things right off the bat, but I'm not a complainer, so that paired with how well she made up for it, the food, and general ambiance negate the tiny mistakes. 
Had the Red Flannel hash, their take on corned beef hash. Very hearty and tasty.  All the ingredients on the menu are farm fresh and local to Cleveland, and you can taste the difference and effort they put into their plates.  Fiance had the omelet with ham, grilled onions and peppers. Awesome.  They have a build your own Bloody bar, which is AMAZING. That alone is worth the trip!  Definitely will visit when we return, and will happily recommend Urban to travellers from Chicago!!  Great place!"}
{"text":"First, the people are friendly. Also, I enjoyed my ox-tail soup plus bread. It was a little over $12. There wasn't much too it though. 
The other items on the menu were very expensive. I don't know why the price range is so wrong on this yelp listing! Yelp has it listed as two $ signs. \"$$\" which is supposed to be $11-30. Most meals from what I could see would have taken me over $30 for sure!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar had dinner. The steak was cooked deliciously and the mac and cheese was great with its roasted tomatoes. Corn bread was delicious as well. Would recommend as a great place to have a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Local and thoughtful.  I went for the Halibut - have definitely had better preparations of the fish, but the mushrooms and root vegetables underneath were outstanding.  Nice, chic atmosphere and local wines on the wine list."}
{"text":"Staff was great and friendly. Food was not good at all. Had the braised brisket. Co-worked had it too and he didn't like it either. For the price, more was expected."}
{"text":"Thank you Urban Farmer for coming to Cleveland. 

I recently visited with my dad after a trip to the art museum and wow, we left super impressed and happily full! The restaurant gives a sort of ambiance that makes you feel at home all the while being in a high end steakhouse. The booths are cozy and the decor is modern. The local farms they get ingredients from are listed above the kitchen and jars of pickled vegetables sit on shelves around the tables. Our waiter Tyler was fantastic! I would definitely ask to be seated in his section again. He knew everything about all ingredients on the menu and had fantastic recommendations. He had humor as well and that is a fantastic talent to have when working with people all day. My dad likes to make jokes about everything and even though some of them are lame he rolled with it. Two thumbs up!

Now for the food. We each ordered a steak, I got the Tri Tip that was on special for the month and my dad also got a special steak (which unfortunately I cannot remember the name of \"doh\"). We also ordered the Creamed Spinach Gratin and Brussels Sprouts. I cannot tell you the last time I had creamed spinach but man oh man was it fantastic! For dessert we took Tyler's recommendation of the Butterscotch Sundae and boy am I glad we did! It was presented beautifully and tasted like dessert perfection. 

What a tremendous first experience!"}
{"text":"Spacious comfortable setting
Good service-waitress was pleasant and attentive
Interesting selection of food the taste quality for the most part lacked distinction"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for happy hour and brunch, but I can say it's one of my favorite places in Cleveland for those two reasons. 

My go-to for happy hour is the charcuterie board. All of the cured meats and pates are so delicious and I always feel particularly adventurous when I'm breaking out of my boring picky box. Beef tongue? Only Urban Farmer's charcuterie board could get me to eat it. 

The cocktails I've had during happy hour have not been my favorite. They're pretty mediocre, so I might just end up sticking to beer here. I also got soup once and it was good, but I quickly realized I have a favorite item here and I shouldn't stray from that.

I went for brunch once as well and was impressed with the smoked salmon bagel, no surprise. I'd definitely come back for that too! Brunch cocktails are a different story compared to happy hour cocktails--the bloody mary bar here is amazing. All of the house pickled items are delicious and the variety of drink garnishes is impressive!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and took my coworkers to Urban Farmer for dinner. The food was good, the fromage cart was lovely, but our server Nancee was visibly disappointed having to wait on us. Service was slow, her responses were curt, and as a former service in fine dining I would have expected a more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"By far one of the best experiences I've had at a steak house. First class food, first class service. Food melted in our mouths, steak was like butter. You get a great bread plate when you sit all fresh baked here. Everything is fresh from local farms. Not only was the food incredible but the service made us feel like royalty. Great wait staff, managers check on you constantly. Would recommend and I'll def be back !"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!
Corn bread and potato tart was delicious

Debbie from Indy"}
{"text":"Definitely worth it to stop by the Urban Farmer. It's quite pricey but worth it. Probably the best steak I have had in a while if not ever. The sides where big portions which meant we could order a couple and all share at the table. Service was great and ambiance was perfect."}
{"text":"Imagine if the Cheesecake Factory had really incredible steaks and fantastic cocktails.  Urban Farmer is kind of that.

The good: 

The steaks are really amazing, and cooked correctly.  We split a Wagyu ribeye, medium rare, and it came out perfectly cooked and minimally seasoned, well rested and nicely cut.  One of the best steaks I've ever had.  Most of the steaks are big enough to share.

The cocktail menu offered a nice mix of interesting, unique drinks, and classics.  The waitress knew her stuff and recommended drinks based on some preferences we told her, and even insisted on replacing a drink that my wife didn't like.  (Nothing wrong with the drink, it just didn't do it for her.)  The drinks were really fantastic and expertly prepared.

Our waitress was wonderful all around.  She took good care of us, knew the menus, and was attentive without being intrusive.  

The bad:

The overall decor is urban-theme almost to the point of the old TGIFridays decor.  Not kitschy in the same way, but just really trying very hard to be... Portlandia.  Potted artisan grasses as room dividers, that kind of thing.  It's also a pretty huge space, with high ceilings and wide aisles.  The night we were there it was largely empty on a Saturday night, and made for a pretty cold atmosphere.

The sides, which are huge and made for sharing, are rich, simple, and not memorable.  We had the big cheesy potato tart thing, and I honestly can't remember what else.  Since the steak is a la carte and so perfectly done, it feels like the sides should be better than wedding food fare.  

Guys, it's a steak house.  Buy some good steak knives.  It sounds like a nitpick, but at this price point you need better flatware.

The prices, like the steaks and sides, are big.  Plan on $100+ per person.  

Conclusion:

Most of the pieces of Urban Farmer are really good.  But they don't really add up to the experience that the price should provide.  For the same or less money, you can have a really incredible, memorable, experience at a dozen other top restaurants in town, with much more complex flavors and more intimate spaces.  You won't regret eating here, or even necessarily spending the money, but you can do a lot better in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place has it all. A great atmosphere, great service and a farm to table concept. You will be hard pressed to find anything better in the city at these prices and with such an accessible menu. Honestly this place blew away my expectations. If you can get here do it. I also found that they had one in Portland, either way. Try it!!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here when I was in Cleveland for work.  It was alright - decent food but seems a bit overpriced for the food, and the bartender was not very helpful (and the spot was not busy) when I was there.  Overall, it is ok if your staying at the Westin and need something convenient, but otherwise go for a stroll somewhere else."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Wait staff treated me like a criminal. Insisted that I pay for my meal with a credit card before feeding it to me. Waitress barely spoke English so communication was difficult. Food not bad, but I will not come back because of the sorry way I was charged up front."}
{"text":"Overall, not a bad place, but it didn't meet my expectations. I expected it to be a bit pricier due to it being a high end place, but just expected a better steak to match. I ordered the New York 14oz Creekstone, Kansas, corn-fed steak which was cooked per my request. The side dishes were pretty good tho and big! The Mac & cheese was quite tasty! 

I guess my biggest complaint would be the wait. The staff was decent, but placing and receiving a drink and then food order just took too long for my liking. Seemed like they had enough people working, so maybe just a training issue??

I wouldn't mind going again, if someone else was buying, but prob wouldn't on my dime. Better local places when looking at quality/experience vs cost."}
{"text":"Yum! The food was good and the service was even better. We were in Cleveland for a wedding and had less than stellar food experiences on our trip. This was the last ditch effort for something decent to eat and it delivered. My girlfriend had a severe cold and the waitress made amazing smelling mint tea concoction!"}
{"text":"Yup--came here for salads while visiting and came back the next day--for salads.

If you're a salad person you'll understand.

Also met Shaq here, which was pretty fun."}
{"text":"Good food but amazing rum selection. Actually the steaks are amazing too. Did I mention the rum selection????? Staff was helpful and attentive,  I sat at the bar. Love the local vibe. Potato tart was yummy. I will come back if ever I am in town again."}
{"text":"We had a very nice week day meal, trying the three types of steak - grass fed, corn fed and ....(some other type). We had a few cocktails before our meal so my memory of the experience is vailed through booze. We enjoyed an appetizer of pig belly and worked our way through the main course served with a family style bowl of Mac N Cheese, seriously some of the best I've ever had. The restaurant is what you expect from bearded, organic Whole Foods lot. I'm ok with that scene but I don't have a beard and avoid wearing tennis shoes with dress pants so I prefer a high end steak house with more comforting settings, better linens and friendlier staff. I'd recommend this place based on food but I'd try something different next time downtown just as personal preference."}
{"text":"I've eaten at dozens upon dozens of steak houses, possible 100's and the 7x Wagyu Ribeye I had here was hands down THE BEST EVER! So flavorful and tender, it legit melted in your mouth. Everything was great really, we had the pierogi appetizer along with the octopus and both were delicious. Our server Bill was knowledgeable and fun! Sides were great too, get the twice baked fingerling potatoes."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable. Very friendly but professional, everything was timely and the correct warmth. Steaks were cooked well, however, there was a bit too much salt on the steak, as well as in the macaroni and cheese and mushrooms. Nothing was inedible, but it was a downer considering the quality of the steak and the price.

That being said, the braised oxtail appetizer was amazingly delicious. The meat might have had slightly too much salt but it was well balanced with the cream and vegetables. Absolutely the best part of the meal. Unfortunately we were too full to eat dessert so I cannot comment on that."}
{"text":"This review is only for their burger. I've had it twice now and I must say this burger is probably one of the best burgers I ever had. The homemade biscuit is served as a hamburger bun which is nice and gives it a different texture than your typical boring brioche bun! The biscuit is nicely crisped on the edges and softer in the middle.

Next the tomato jam is a nice complement adding a touch of tartness and then now let's talk about that juicy hamburger meat. The meat is not something you buy from Ralph's. It has a nice consistency with a robust nutty flavor. It's cooked perfectly (medium) and it's literally one of the best burgers ever. Just look at the picture. 

The brussel sprouts are good, but they aren't my favorite. I can't wait to be back to come  here for their steaks. It can only be that much better since the hamburger meat is already BOMB!"}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is aesthetically pleasing atmosphere, but the food seemed to be not up to par with the prices. Just got back from lunch there, and it was very OK. 

Ordered the Local Greens Salad, add Chicken. It was very small. I am being generous saying it was side salad sized. Also, the quinoa on top is not freshly made quinoa, it is like dried or baked, reminding me more of a crouton, and there was MAYBE a tablespoon on the bottom of the plate hidden beneath 25 pieces of lettuce. And four to six blueberries then a couple strips of carrots. Total for this and a club soda came out to be $22 dollars. Ridiculous for a mini bare side salad and a drink that is carbonated water. 

Dining mates ordered the chicken sandwich and the burger. You are definitely better off ordering this \"regular meal sized portion\" for essentially half the price. Sub fries for a side salad if you're trying to be healthy but don't waste your money on the full priced salad.

Also, FYI you don't get bread at lunch."}
{"text":"I was served a raw chicken sandwich today at Urban Farmer. I took a few bites from the edge of the sandwich, which I hope were cooked through, moved onto the salad, took another bite towards the center and realized the chicken was not cooked. I immediately had to spit it out in my napkin.

The manager came over and apologized saying he was \"mortified\" and offered to make me something else, to which I declined. Clearly, my appetite was gone after that experience. He then gave me a card for a free lunch for the next time I came in. I'm from out of town so I certainly won't be back.

I appreciate the way the staff handled the situation, but there is simply no excuse for serving raw chicken. Especially in sandwich form, which should not be difficult to cook properly. No one can compensate me for having to wait out the next 48 hours hoping that I don't get food poisoning.

If you go for lunch, my advice is to cut into your sandwich first to make sure it's cooked. I really regret not doing that this afternoon."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but we were told outside tables were reserved.. Julie did an awesome job trying to cover the packed bar while most outside tables were empty. The host told us again that he was sorry we weren't able to sit outside and that every one of the tables was in fact reserved (while almost all tables were empty. If there aren't enough servers, say so don't BS us."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mother's Day brunch great customer service and the manager came over and asked us if everything was OK and talk to us and told us all about the restaurant highly recommend this for a Sunday Brunch"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  I was glad to see they re organized the menu to focus on steak.  Finally!  Cod was delicious, filets were killer, potato tart and mac and cheese were yummy.  Vegetable salad with honey dreasing and quinoa was 5 star all the way.  Sadly, the kid's meal was NOT good.  Horribly overcooked and dry chicken but the BBQ sauce was good as were the fries. Smores tart and butterscotch sundae are not to be missed.  Beyond delicious.  Service was attentive.  The bad thing about the dining room is how dark it is.  I was sitting facing the front windows and I had a difficult time seeing the expression on the face of the person sitting across from me at the table.  And after a glass of wine it just got worse ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Excellent sandwiches!! Very reasonable prices for great, locally sourced food. Wonderful service and atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just horrible in all aspects. We sat down, received no attention from the waitress and water etc took awhile (8-10 minutes). We ordered a salad, entree, and sides. The salad took 38 minutes from restaurant arrival for a simple Caesar salad. 

We ordered the wagyu New York strip medium and a bone in aged steak medium rare. The first wagyu was entirely raw, so I had to wait 15 min; then the second one was over cooked and was awful. I've had wagyu beef 15 times in my life- this was not wagyu. It wasn't even a mediocre quality steak. The bone in aged strip was good at first until we got to the second half which was raw. The alleged \"steak\" restaurant was 3 for 3 in cooking the meat terribly. The quality of the meat was also below par. 

I explained this to the manager and she comped one steak. The bill was $135 so I left $140 cash on the table and walked out. This was the first time in 29 years on this earth I've essentially not tipped. I go out to eat an average of 3-4 times a week and the quality of this experience for the cost was so out of touch with reality. I would 100% recommend that nobody ever attend this place and it should be closed down."}
{"text":"I was super eager to try Urban Farmer for brunch. The dining room is absolutely charming fusing farmhouse and industrial interior design. The walls are lined with mason jars full of pickled veggies and the lighting is low, but not too low. 

I was deciding between the chicken biscuit dish and the shaved sirloin Benedict. I went with the Benny. I was super happy with my decision. The English muffins are homemade and larger than average. The sirloin was super tender. The eggs were poached perfectly. 

We were seated promptly (as we had reservations). The waiter was not the friendliest, but not rude either. 

We are in town one more night and I am seriously considering going back tomorrow for the chicken biscuit dish."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place during a recent visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Holy moly. One of the best breakfasts ever! The benedict, on huge fresh-baked English muffins with naturally-raised shaved ham and perfect hollandaise, is mad-good. And the brioche French toast with hazelnut butter, blueberry preserves and locally produced maple syrup is...  Oh, sorry, I went there in my mind and forgot where I was.  Go!  Eat!  Be one with your food! No, I don't know what that means, but just do it!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday and had a great meal. The cheese offering was impressive. The homemade cornbread rivaled the best I have ever had. The steaks were incredible. The carrots and twice baked fingerling potato tart still make me hungry just thinking about it.  The only less than ideal issue was the open layout led to a bit more noise than I had anticipated."}
{"text":"Very good ingredients, great service and atmosphere, but the seasoning and acid/fat balances were way off. Too much butter and dressings, not enough acid or herbs. Not recommended for foodies."}
{"text":"I was very upset with my experience at Urban Farmer. My husband has been there many times for brunch & lunch and always raved about it so when he recently got promoted, we went to dinner at Urban Farmer to celebrate. First - although the décor is cool, I found the way seating worked to be very inconvenient and unfavorable. Although the tables aren't connected, the booth seating (low-end) turned our romantic dinner into sharing dinner with a family with children (very annoying). The booths are also very low so I felt like we were also sharing dinner with the booth behind us that was connected to us. I could hear their whole conversation. The entire dinner was loud and not private in the least bit (something you would expect from such an expensive restaurant). I ordered the scallops. Now I'm not blind, I saw the prices going in to the dinner and had no problem paying for the ~$40-50 entree that didn't even include sides since it was a special occasion & I knew the food would be delicious. Unfortunately I was wrong. I honestly feel I could have gotten the same quality of scallops at a chain, middle of the line restaurant. I have never thought of sending a plate back with nothing wrong with it other than it just wasn't good. I got brussel sprouts as a side ($12) that also were just average and undercooked. My husband had similar feelings about his steak and mac n cheese. This is Cleveland OH, if you are going to offer food at this price it is expected to be amazing quality. Instead, we had a $150 bill for an extremely average 2 drinks, 2 entrees, & 2 sides. Again, I was fully prepared to spend this money but the fact that not only did we not love but just like our meals was so incredibly upsetting and disappointing. I would give it one star but my husband did say that brunch was very good."}
{"text":"Walked in, sat down, review the menu, and walked out. Can't tell you if the food is very good, but it's too gosh darn expensive for me"}
{"text":"I have been to Urban farmer twice now and highly recommend it. It is in my top 5 restaurants in Cleveland. Both times I had filet it was fantastic. The spring salad was delicious. One of my favorite sides was the fingerling potato casserole it's to die for !!!!! Also the dessert with the blonde brownie, ice cream and I think it had butterscotch was amazing. My husband and I were fighting over it!! The drinks are great and both of our servers were A+ . We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is for lunch only. I wish we'd had the time or the foresight to eat our evening meal here but we did not. 

Lunch was great. Service was good. Atmosphere was very cool and warm and hip. 

My sandwich was good - not great. But the real star was actually the side salad. They have some sort of proprietary spring mix thing that is amazing. Usually a side salad is a total throwaway but here is was the star. 

Will for sure be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my breakfast there today.  Great atmosphere and service.  Eggs Benedict had more meat on them than expected in a good way."}
{"text":"This place was good for brunch. My friend had her graduation party brunch there. I thought the service was alright. The food was okay as well but had to send a couple of things back. Over not a bad place for brunch."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch today and had a very good experience! I definitely would have snapped some pictures, but I was on a business meeting.

I had the turkey panini with a side of fruit. The entree comes with the option of fruit, fries or a small side salad. It was a bit pricy, but the quality of the food made it all worth it. The panini had so many interesting flavors, from the avocado spread to the aioli and roasted portobello. And the bread... Hands down the best panini I have ever had. 

The interior of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and really emphasizes on the company's efforts to provide local food. It was a great location for a business outing, and I would definitely go back for a nice dinner. And there is valet!"}
{"text":"Manager said \"we have this problem all the time on the patio . . . its the lighting\".

 So, I had the most bizarre and disappointing dining experience last night at Urban Farmer. I was working late (I work in the attached office building) so my husband  decided to just meet for dinner at UF at about 7pm in the summer with plenty of natural light still left in the evening (this is an important detail). I ordered the flatiron steak medium rare. The steak comes out a clear medium (my husband ordered his medium and it came out well). Waitress (who was fantastic) offers to take it back and fire a new one. Second one comes out medium too. Waitress (who was fantastic) offers to take it off the bill. I thank her.

And then it gets weird . . . manager comes out and says \"the chef says we have this problem all the time on the patio . . . its the lighting, the steak is actually medium rare\". I said \"its not the lighting, this is clearly medium.\"   The steak had a thick band of light pink through the middle but was more browned than pink, sides of the steak were a rich brown color and the top and bottom  were charred darkly with some play through the middle but firm to the touch. The manager then said some other weird stuff, like asking three times if I wanted another steak fired (that would be the third one and at this point I just wanted to go home) and then ended comp'ing the whole meal (which we did not want, the rest of the meal was fine . . . not great but fine). She goes from trying to prevent the server from giving us one free steak to giving us a whole free meal - just crazy.

Chef obviously doesn't know his temperatures and is blaming it on lighting - weird and incredibly unprofessional. For a place that sells an $80 steak, you'd hope for a chef that knows how to cook a true medium rare and is more professional than challenging diners and blaming it on the natural lighting of the patio.

 Probably not going back for dinner - have had lunch here multiple times and it is fine."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, high prices and a noisy, obnoxious decor?

Don't bother."}
{"text":"I ate here recently and had a great experience.   The service was very attentive and kind.   Our meal was so enjoyable.   Here's what we had, bone marrow, steak tartar, squid, 24 ounce steak, cheese plate appetizer, potatoes, and mushrooms.   To drink we had a bourbon (great selection) and bottle of Malbec.    There is nothing we would have changed.   The bill for our meal was not cheap but it was worth it.   Try this place if you've never been.  Enjoy!  Btw, there was four of us."}
{"text":"We visited Urban Farmer on Thanksgiving for the prix fixe meal, and we were not disappointed. In a world where so many restaurants claim to be \"farm to table,\" Urban Farmer clearly does the farm to table genuinely and well. It is fun to see where exactly each ingredient was sourced. Everything was prepared well, but the steak was my favorite part of the meal. Looking forward to going back on a \"normal\" day."}
{"text":"Four stars might be too much, but three is definitely too little.  I wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars.  We went here because we stayed at the Westin the night prior which is where this restaurant is located.  

Very cool decor in this restaurant.  I love the big square tables that seat about 12 people.  Great for a group.  There are also two rooms that hold these too.  Not a huge breakfast/brunch menu but as other people described it, a very complicated way to work with food.  I ordered  the farm eggs with bacon toast and probably the best hash brown I've ever had.  He got the corned beef hash, or their take on it.  Very different but very good.  Most of the breakfast choices are slights twits on typical meals.  

The reason for the less stars is the price.  For two of us, with no alcohol it was almost $50 (with tip) for breakfast!!  I mean, I had eggs, toast and bacon!  I get that it's a new, trendy place and everyone in Cleveland wants to say they've been here and love it but wow.  I would go back for a special occasion but not make this a regular place."}
{"text":"While traveling we always like to check out non-chain upscale steakhouses, & Urban Farmer was definitely not a let down. 

I would suggest trying to use OpenTable or call ahead for a reservation. We had about a 30 minute wait on a Saturday evening (to be expected). 
We took seats at the bar while waiting for our table & enjoyed the wide variety of cocktail selections they offered. I had the Green Acres that is made with their homemade orange cello, and found it to be delicious. 

Jumping ahead, we both ordered rare filet cut steaks, and thought they were 'cooked' very nicely. The sides are shareable, so we split the Mac & cheese. Very creamy, adding in the breadcrumbs for a good texture. 
They bring out bread before your meal as well, the cornbread really stood out. 

Our server was an older gentleman, bald I believe, and was hands down one of my favorite waiters I've ever encountered. He was so accommodating, kind and far from pushy or stuck up, which you sometimes find in these settings. 

This place provides quality, so expect your bill to reflect that. Our bill was around $150 for the two of us. Well worth it. 

If you're in town, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just when we gave up hope of Cleveland having any decent restaurants we had our last dinner in town here and it was amazing. You can give Michael Symon's place a big old skip and come here instead if you want impressive service and even more impressive food.

The restaurant is clean and the decor is a modern farm to table vibe. It's awesome. It's definitely on the spendy side but also totally worth it. 

We started with the cheese service which is wheeled over on a cart and we were given samples of each cheese we could choose from to build our cheese plate. With each sample we were given the region, the aging process, and the methods used on how the particular flavors were developed. It was a fun, informative, delicious experience. We then chose six cheeses to build our board. All of them were incredible. 

For dinner we all ordered steaks. These were all prime examples of what beef should be. The cook was absolutely perfect and the meat was delicious. So much better than the grease ball called ribeye you'd get at Lola's. Seriously, if you want good steak, come here. They list each cut of beef and then you can choose the weight, region, and type (corn fed, grass fed). It's phenomenal. 

The sides were all equally tasty and big enough to share with the table. The cocktails were also incredibly creative and delicious. I had a cocktail (ok, three) with pickled beet juice that were amazing.

After all the let downs in Cleveland's dining scene, this place is a rockstar and competes with some of the best restaurants I've been to in the country. Go here. You won't be disappointed, especially if you're a carnivore."}
{"text":"I have entertained clients here multiple times now.  Each time, the service has been outstanding.  The have a great selection of beers and cocktails, the Murray Hill in particular is my favorite.  The brussel sprouts are fantastic and the farm burger in the lounge is the best I have had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Got off to a slow start, think they forgot about me. However, waitress and staff were very friendly. The scallops and butterscotch sundae were on point. I like the upscale yet homey atmosphere . A little pricey but it was high quality and in a very nice part of town"}
{"text":"I love the unique decor of this place and went recently to a birthday dinner of sorts.  The staff was very friendly and the food we had was amazing!!!  

Didn't have any signature drinks this time around, but I have been there on other occasions and I know that you can say that those are stellar as well!!!  

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The vibe is really nice. Unfortunately the food is too expensive to be nice. The steaks are very pricey - my NY Strip was about $40 for 12 oz. It was correctly cooked and tasted good, but wasn't anything to write home about. It's not hard to find a good steak for $30 or even less. Even back in DC I can get a great steak for less than $40! Also, the $40 is just the steak... the sides are separate. My fries were about $9 and they were, well... just ordinary fries. Again, nothing to write home about.

So overall the steak was good and the fries were good, but the prices were way too high. Spend less and get a perfectly fine steak just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch meeting with a couple clients in December. The food was absolutely delicious. I finished everything on my plate and would have liked to eat even more. It was my first time there, so I didn't have a good sense of what size the portions are. I'll plan on ordering a little more the next time I go there. One of the salads (Caesar maybe?) was a little annoying to eat because the plate was too small for it. 

Service was a bit on the slow side, but it's understandable as the place was pretty packed and it was around the holidays. The staff was friendly and we were all engaged in work conversation so we didn't mind.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"O, where to begin. I'll keep it short. 
Cocktails: 5/5 All of it. Bourbon cocktails only for me and zero complaints 
Service: 5/5. Informative and efficient. Overlappingly
Apps 4.5/5 Charcuterie plate. Not a strong flavored as I would truly wish, but only .5 a star so...
Entrees 4/5 21-day dry aged strip: not sure if I've ever had something so long dry aged, but I found it to be very flavorful yet tough. Perfectly cooked to temperature. Grits: too corn-flavored to be enjoyable with the corn overtones of the beef. Entirely subjective 
I'd come back"}
{"text":"I don't always give 5 stars but this place killed it! 

Sunday brunch started with the mimosa bar- to note there is also a Bloody Mary bar, but we decided to go the champagne route. Selection of juices, purees (get the strawberry) and fruit to go along with it!

For the starters we ordered the smoked fish which was salmon. Absolutely amazing and the add ins it came with were great. I think there were onions soaked on beer juice if I was correct for one of the items which was so different! We shared with 4 people but I easily could've gotten this for myself as a main meal and been overly satisfied.

Next let's talk about the Benedicts- HUGE!!!! Easily the size of a bagel in diameter per piece. I had the avocado and my boyfriend had the sirloin steak which was loaded with meat that was sliced thin and cooked perfectly. 

We also ordered steak and eggs which was good, came with sausage gravy which was the lighter color with chunks that i prefer over the darker ones. The \"breakfast potatoes\" was a hash brown type as you would get at mcdonalds, but wayyy better and perfectly crispy on the outside.

We also got the French toast to share which I thought was good but I'm not a huge sweets with breakfast person (with hazelnut and blueberries). Again 4 HUGE pieces. My dad also (we eat a lot haha) got the duck confit and could not stop raving about the duck.

This place will not be a \"one and done\" would
Love to try dinner or lunch!


The inside was had very neat decor and a bar that looked stocked with an extensive whiskey selection. This place is also attached to the hotel ( we did not stay at the hotel or go to the bar though, so can't comment there)"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey!  I wanted a basic grilled chicken breast type of meal, but the only chicken option was an entire half chicken and the price was close to $40. The hostess and server were very friendly and the level of service was overall outstanding. I ended up ordering a salad and Mac and cheese, which was really good. I gave it three stars because I think it is overpriced. My food was good and the atmosphere was unique. My friends food was not that great. She got a shrimp special, but I don't recall what was in it. If I were to go again I would definitely sit in the bar and order from that menu. You can order sandwiches and appetizers at the bar, but not in the restaurant area."}
{"text":"Needed a dinner for two after an Indians game and this spot came to the rescue with a huge booth in a private setting, with a fantastic bottle of red wine to boot.   Make sure you get the focaccia, even though it's only for lunch.  Mushrooms were something else, and scallops super sweet (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Im here for breakfast... my Server is awesome.. but the egg Benedict I got was not so awesome.. egg was poach all the way thru.. English muffin was burnt. And the little tomato aioli on the side has no flavor other than tomato and mayo. Nice atmosphere though :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast is excellent with all ingredients fresh and plentiful.  The Eggs Benedict were delicious and I had a taste of the bacon and crispy potatoes  as well.

Even though the food was great what really earned the five stars was the service.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive.  They went above and beyond when the offered to get a specialty coffee from a Starbucks inside the same building."}
{"text":"We read many good reviews. Our meals did not seem to rate the high accolades others did. 
My honey biscuit was to come with a chicken leg- it came with a wing. I don't remember mention of the sausage in my fish but there it was. Daughter had burger that looked wonderful she said it was good. Son in law had a Benedict of some type. Said it was ok. 
Our server was less than attentive and the floor was SO unbelievably sticky it was gross!
I wouldn't rush back ayte soon"}
{"text":"The $$ rating is inaccurate with the least expensive steak at $50 and a la carte items adding $10 more each. East Coast Oysters are good, also suggest the marrow and candied bacon sides. For a 42-day dry aged steak at $58, it was rubbery and lacked flavor. Will have a hard time recommending to others and should have taken the place being close to empty in consideration before sitting down."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Westin and had brunch here before heading out.  The Bloody Mary bar!  OMG  so good!!!  I had the Red Flannel Hash, poached eggs, fingerling potatoes, corned beef and their homemade english muffin.  so much food and sooo good!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a hamburger with a side salad.  It was delicious!  It was served on a English Muffin made here and the beef I was told was ground in the restaurant.  The side salad was a pleasant mixed green salad, light dressing and complimented the medium rare juicy burger well.  They also gave a nice collection of craft beers.  This will certainly be my go to place while in Cleveland.  Your in the middle of the country do, if course the service is polite and timely."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had!  Everyone in my family loved the food. Nice walk from Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland I stayed in the Westin downtown. This restaurant is located right in the lobby of the hotel so it was convenient. Not to mention the reviews were really high. So I stopped in for lunch. The ambience is very nice. My waiter was super awesome as well. The food was just \"ok\" . Maybe I ordered the wrong thing on the menu. I'm not sure. I had the farm burger which was suppose to be the best of the best. Seeing they butcher their own meat and use high quality cuts. Anywho ordered it medium and it came out fully cooked and just dry in my opinion. Didn't feel like going through the trouble of sending it back. Especially because our waiter was so sweet. I'm just not wowed by this place."}
{"text":"Great food, quality ingredients with absolutely no service.  This review is based on at least 6 different visits.  The service has never been more than adequate at best.  It's a shame that they can't bring the same level of attention to their hiring as they do their food preparation.  As much as I like the food, I want to be treated like I am a customer and most of your wait staff (breakfast and lunch) doesn't even understand what that means."}
{"text":"This is for the chicken cherry sausage!  The location, decor, and coffee were really good too.  My husband also enjoyed his English muffin burger and fries. We went for brunch and the pricing was good."}
{"text":"Went here for a drink before a concert at the Q since we were staying at the Westin. It was happy hour and I got the house white, which was nice. We also ordered the charcuterie board. It was different than ones I've ordered at other nice restaurant/bars, all meat and no cheese. I did see they had a cheese board in the app list, too, and I bet that'd go great with it. The charcuterie did come with bacon jam, which I had never had. It was interestingly delicious. Service was good and the atmosphere was rustic and cozy. It also happened to be an unseasonably warm February day, so they had the walls open so you could walk right out to their patio. I could see it being a nice hangout on a hot summer weekend. If I'm ever back in town staying at the Westin or just hanging out nearby, I'd like to go back and try some main menu items. Everything sounded fresh and many choices had a unique spin.!"}
{"text":"Avocado eggs Benedict was ok but not great. It's definitely different. Bloody Mary was ok."}
{"text":"Came to Urban Farmer on a Sunday morning for brunch with a reservation for our group. We walked from the hotel 2 blocks away, so I can't speak for the parking situation. There seemed to be enough tables for those without reservations. We ordered Bloody Mary's which were ... meh. Not viscous enough for me to truly enjoy. The food, however, was amazing. We ordered the Flat Iron Steak and Eggs which were mind-blowingly good (mind you, we were all very hungover). The meals also came with an amazing muffin that we ate with the homemade jam. We ended the meal on their delicious doughnuts which were much larger servings than we anticipated. The only part of the experience that brought the review down to 4/5 stars is that service was slightly lacking. We had to ask multiple times for certain items. Other than that, still a restaurant I would return to!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for atmosphere and a great menu. Go for sure!  We are vegetarians and there were also great options for us."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant that Cleveland needs. The vegetarian and vegan options are plentiful. The food is delicious and thoughtfully sourced, the interior design is young and modern and the vibe is very fun. The outdoor seating is also a great touch; it brings life to an otherwise quiet part of downtown.

All the food we had was excellent. The French toast was fat and moist, and sauced with delicious fruits.  The English muffins were giant and fluffy and nicely toasted. The potato galette was nicely crisped and expertly made.  I can't recommend the food enough. I also can't wait to eat here again.

My only complaint is the service. We were a group of six, for a Sunday brunch. The place was about half full, but it still took almost 30 minutes to get our food. We had to flag down our server and other staff several times just to get more coffee and water. Everyone was very nice and in the end we got a discount because of the wait, so I can't complain much at all. But the management does need to figure out why service is so slow on a not busy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Wow. staying at the hotel, seems like the natural choice. But if you're on your own, they will not seat you at a table -- leaving you to fend for yourself in the lounge or at the bar, so a nice working brunch might not be on the agenda. Also, be prepared to wait inordinate amounts of time before receiving any attention fro wait staff. Not just disappointing, but rude and offensive!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak, excellent presentation, personal-feeling service,  That's worth a few repeat visits."}
{"text":"I recently went to Cleveland for the weekend and stayed at the Westin (which was fabulous) but also attached to the Urban Farmer.  We only had brunch here as we were out both nights at other events but I have to say this is the best brunch I have ever had.  Food was perfect and service was awesome and it was packed both times I was there.  My server the first day was Kelly and Joe the second day ( I only know this for sure b/c I saved my receipts with their names).  They were great and super attentive.  I hear dinner is great here also and am sorry I didn't have time for that but will definitely be back!  Hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"Wow - amazing bone in rib eye was cooked perfectly. I travel a lot and this rivals the best steak houses in nyc. Creamed spinach best I've ever had - seriously. I don't review many places but this place is worth it"}
{"text":"A solid meal in downtown Cleveland. Wait staff was great and ambience as well. I would go back for another meal, when we are in town again.

I had the halibut, which was really good and light, not heavy. It has a few carrots, mushrooms with it. 

My husband had the filet (grass fed) which is a la carte, which I tried and thought was very tender. He wasn't as impressed as me and I am usually the pickier one. I think he felt for the price ($48? or so) it could have been better. He ordered the side of carrots, which were delicious. I ordered the beet salad as an app, which was a good size. It was mostly cubed beets (red and golden) with some butternut squash. 

They bring out some fresh in-house baked corn bread (delicious!) and rolls. 

All in all, a good experience. Their focus is beef and locally sourced food. The selection of steaks is pretty good and then they have grain fed, grass fed, etc... so you have multiple choices. 

There were a few seafood choices, including char, halibut and one other that I can't recall - maybe scallops? 

Not my most impressive meal in Cleveland but pretty high ranking! The only reason that I wouldn't return is to simply try one of the many other options available in the city."}
{"text":"I was not real hungry so I went with the steak tartare and the beet and squash salad. The beet and squash salad was very fresh and wonderful tasting.  The flavors all made sense. The steak tartare was ok but not great. In my opinion, the steak tartare was missing acid. Bringing acid into the meal would add much more depth. The canned cornbread with whipped butter and sea salt was a pleasant surprise. The restaurant is a little pricey, but is worth the try."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for their brunches. A bit pricey for what they serve. Decent food, nothing special I thought. My friends raved about the avocado benedict though, so that's probably the way to go."}
{"text":"This spot is off the hook, crazy good! The bartender Desiree was amazing. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Breakfast was very good. The red flannel hash was okay, not one of my favorites though. The honey biscuit was delicious and the potato hash brown was tasty too. Bloody Mary is a must try too. They had a BM bar but I opted to just have to bartender make me one. I am so glad we found this place and it was so close to the hotel. Bonus."}
{"text":"Nice roomy resto with a hip farm decor feel with the wheat and jars of preserves on wooden shelves.  

Ordered the local greens to start and the walleye and dry aged beef mains.  The local greens had a really nice texture of crispy, crunchy, sweet, and crispy with quinoa, blueberries, radish, and onion in a sweet dressing.   The Parker house rolls and corn bread were also tasty.  The fish was cooked perfectly as was the steak.  The apple donut dessert unfortunately was not cooked properly (raw in the middle) and they were kind enough to take it off the bill and send out a replacement that was done well.  The strawberry panna cotta was amazing.

The place is listed as $$ on yelp but is really a $$$ as the apps range from $10 and up and the entrees range from $20 and up with side dishes such as veggies costing extra.

Service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated! The wait staff was wonderful and management handled our issues but they need to do something about the customer experience or they won't be around long.  We had an open table reservation for four and the evening began with them trying to seat us at a huge table in the middle of the restaurant where we never could have had a normal conversation without yelling across the table. When we asked to get another table as there were several available, we were told that they could not move us to another and we ended up going to a narrow hightop table in the bar. The night was filled with an infestation of fruit flies, a very sub par waygu steak, and 4 people who dine out regularly vowing to not return."}
{"text":"We had brunch here and loved it!  This place has very cozy and relaxing feel to it.  As far as the food goes they use all natural local produced foods which makes it somewhat pricey however it is well worth it."}
{"text":"An other excellent meal at The Urban Farmer this last weekend! The first time we visited was for Sunday brunch and we immediately decided that we needed to come back for dinner. We arrived Saturday evening and noted a positive vibe in the dinning room, couples to small groups enjoying a night out on the town. The decor is nice, clean and not your typical wood and leather steak house look, pictures of local food suppliers on the wall and a beautiful display of preserved food making up a room divide. 

Seated right away in a nice booth and menus where brought out quickly. Well rounded drink menu with a extensive selection of whiskey, tequila, cordials and wines that sound meet most dinners wants. We started with a dozen oysters on the half shell, a mix of east and west coast, that were fresh and cleanly shucked. 

Our main course selection was a local sourced steak from Madison, Oh. Mine was served up a perfect rare plus while my wife's was on the temperature mark of medium. Both steaks were tasty, properly cooked and seasoned just right. We split side dishes of mushrooms and a seasonal blistered beans. I would happily order these sides again. 

We ended the meal with a selection of cheeses that were served up table side. It was nice to be able to sample the varieties before making the final selection and having a enthusiastic server helping on the selection process."}
{"text":"I must say overall pretty impressed with urban farmer mind you this is only a review about brunch and only the sweeter options...

Pros 
First I really enjoyed the decor of the place. Once you walk in its this hybrid homestyle and modern feel... They have a large bar area with really fun chairs even s rocking chair... It appears they have an extensive cocktail menu as well as wine and beer. We started with the cheese plate followed by the waffle and French toast... All the food was really tasty and came out nice and hot. The waffle came out with some thick cut pieces of bacon and was delicious... My French toast was covered in a berry compote which was sweet tart combo didn't even need syrup.They did come often to refill my coffee which was delicious and hot


Cons 
So one of the irks of this place was that the wine was a little too expensive by the glass.. Also I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese plate. I didn't get to try the charcuterie this visit so can't comment. Another issue was the service started attentive but as the visit went on it was a little sparse...

Overall this place gets four stars and would definitely return to try some of the burgers, sandwiches and other savory dishes.... Also they do use all their ingredients from local farms.. How awesome is that"}
{"text":"Admittedly, one of my favorite things to do with my husband is to go to brunch on Sunday, and after much anticipation, we decided upon Urban Farmer. We were welcomed warmly and seated promptly, the ambiance of the place is spectacular with a definite Portland feel. We were waited on after a long wait by a very unenthusiastic server, at this point signaling a down hill slide. After another long wait for our food, during which we had to flag down the manager to get a refill of coffee, one of the entrees brought out was wrong. We were then pressured by the server to hurry up and sign off on the receipt, something I also found very off-putting. My husband ordered the sirloin Benedict and I ordered the cheddar bacon biscuit. For being a steakhouse, he found his sirloin had a surprising lack of flavor. While my meal was good, it was very heavy and tasted like it was prepared with large amounts of butter, by sandwich also contained an entire split sausage, something not made clear in the description and also seemingly out of place. The food was decent, but not worth the price that we paid, for which I would expect something more transcendent. Urban farmer did have a unique Bloody Mary bar that was rather interesting, but after the lackluster service we received, I don't ever plan on coming back to try it."}
{"text":"I've now been to three of their locations. The Cleveland, Portland, and Philadelphia are all very similar but unique at the same time.  This review is about the Cleveland location. 

Location - it's in the bottom of the Westin Hotel at the corner of a very busy part of downtown Cleveland.

Ambiance - the place is dope as one would expect. The decor is modern industrial meets Midwest farm if that make sense.  During the warmer months they beautiful sidewalk dining outside that is partitioned off from the unwashed masses passing by. 

Food - I've eaten there on multiple occasions for every meal. The breakfast is always very fresh and changes seasonally. The munch has a host of farm to table options like burgers and such. The dinner always has a beef selection that is being promoted from various organic farms across the country. 

Cocktails - an okay bourbon selection and craft spirits selection. Some of their specialty cocktails are very tasty. Especially their interpretation of an Old Fashion. 

What keeps me from giving it five stars?  Bathroom location is a mile away it seems inside the hotel lobby. Petty I know....but I'm impossible to please."}
{"text":"My friend and I had gone to urban farmer for lunch on a Wednesday.  I had gotten the farm burger, which tasted like it had been cooked a half hour before they served it to me. The english muffin bun was soggy and the burger was cold. I didn't say anything to the server, as we were strapped for time and it had taken 35 minutes to get our food in the first place. I was really disappointed in our experience, given all the rave reviews I had heard."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Food was delicious. They also accommodate dietary needs. I was able to get egg whites and the steel cut oats (which I highly recommend) however- the service was exceptionally slow:("}
{"text":"I started with oysters they were out of atlantic but pacific Great Britain ones. Yummy.  I have 26oz porter house with mushrooms and shallots , Brussel sprouts and squash Apple side.  Everything was to perfections. Was so good the steak was med rare on rare side.  They had full bar with red bull. That was impressive since other steak houses do not.  Great wine selection. My gf had the Ohio steak and she loved her med well steak as well.  We had two wonderful bartenders that served our food and drinks.  This being a 300 dollar dinner after drinks sides and main course.  I would still come back."}
{"text":"The food & atmosphere are why I give this place stars. The breakfast \"Chicken Cherry\" sausage is a must. The service is lacking. Several conversations going on my the under worked staff. My waiter was not attentive at all. He made me feel like he was doing me a favor by allowing me to eat. I won't let this one bad experience stop my repeat business, I'm sure it's a one-off situation. And did I mention....the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Westin and because of cold and snow I ended up dining at Urban Farmer twice while I was there. I was pleasantly surprised--hotel restaurants can be very mediocre, but Urban Farmer was a quality restaurant with great, friendly staff.

For my first meal there I had a caesar salad and wine. The salad made for a great, late night dinner and the bar was a cozy place to have a drink and watch TV. The second time I ate there I had a burger and fries, which was also a good meal. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were great.

However, while I did enjoy my food I am only giving Urban Farmer four stars because I felt the food was overpriced. Many of the entrees are between $30 and $50 and the salads and appetizers are between $12 and $15. I don't think the prices are unreasonable in theory, but in actuality the menu is basically comfort food with a twist. As a result, I'm just not sure it would be my first choice if I wasn't staying at the hotel and/or snowed in."}
{"text":"Nice hotel with good accommodations.  The bed and pillows were excellent and the usual accoutrements were better than average.  Why not more than three stars?  Two reasons (both cost related):
-  That a major hotel still charges for Internet access in this day and age is ridiculous, especially considering how it's typically part of the basic package for other hotels.  In the case of Westin, they charge $13/day!  But they offer a bargain price of $39 for three days.  Yes, folks, for the price of a month's worth of cable access at home you can get three days at the Westin.
-  Urban Farmer, the restaurant that is housed in the hotel, is fine but with really ridiculous prices.  Their mission statement, posted on one of their walls, claims (in part) \"respect for midwestern food traditions\".  Somehow I strongly doubt that charging $58 for an 18-oz steak, even if from Ohio, speaks to midwestern food traditions.  Those prices are Peter Luger/Smith & Wollensky/The Palm territory and the Urban Farmer has a ways to go here...

I did have breakfast there which was good and priced at normal hotel rates (high but not outrageous).  Only problem was someone forgot my order so I ended up waiting about 15 minutes before someone noticed I didn't have anything on my table."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, entire front is open to the street. 
Service was great, prompt and friendly. I ordered the ahi tuna which was cooked to perfection. Tasty. 
The tuna was served atop of tiny asparagus and string beans which were a bit oily. A potatoe pancake-type side accompanied the tuna, which was ok. I would've preferred a side salad or locally grown asparagus or other steamed veggie. 
Ice tea was delicious."}
{"text":"Friedly staff and good steaks , although my steak was over cooked but quality was perfect , good selection of cocktails .... Not cheap but worth it ....."}
{"text":"The food here is top of the line! My table shared the Charred Octopus, 1/2 Shell Oysters and Crispy Sweetbreads.. so good. My first time having charred octopus and i was an instant fan!
Main course I had the 8 oz Bartels, Oregon, grass-fed TENDERLOIN.. med rare, cooked to perfection! 
Staff was so knowledgeable, friendly and treated us more as family then customers."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here! The menu is fabulous with a high price tag attached. But the cuts of meat are phenomenal in statue and taste. The sides are definitely large enough to to share. Vegetarian and fish options are plentiful.  Ambiance is upscale chic."}
{"text":"Love this place! We stayed at the hotel that it's attached to. The first night we went down for drinks. The bartender was VERY friendly and made good recommendations. We went today for brunch. I had a very good onion soup, and we shared the corned beef hash, and the lump crab omelet. The omelet was GREAT! The hash was good too but there wasn't much meat in it."}
{"text":"What can I say. I like a good happy hour. The first few times I've been there I went for the most enjoyable 3 hour period. Great drinks and food choices. Bartenders are friendly and will chat while you watch them create your latest drink choice. Sit at the bar, make friends and escape for a bit. 

For lunch, I've been twice. Both times I was not disappointed. The menu sometimes has me googling to figure out what exactly I'm possibly going to order but that's always exciting to me. Portions are nice and service has been great.

Looking forward to trying their brunch and also checking out the atmosphere before and after a weeding coming up in September. 

So far so good!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are very juicy and have a ton of flavor! It's a little pricey ($60 for two people including the tip and an appetizer) but worth it!"}
{"text":"It was good.  Parts of it were unique and interesting and parts of it were not quite up to the standard I'd expect for the prices.

We ordered: 
1. The Flannel Hash - this I thought was the standout dish, well seasoned, interesting and perfectly cooked.  Can't fault this dish.
2. The steak benedict (can't remember exact name).... My grassfed beef rules that I live by are that it cannot cannot cannot be cooked WELL.  when I read slivered sirloin or whatever cut it was, I didn't expect well done... I expected medium rare at most done.    It was dry and tough and as with overcooked meat, had an almost stale taste.  The English muffin as per other reviews was fabulous, eggs perfectly poached.
3. Brussel sprouts - over salted, over seasoned... the darn things are good - you don't need much to make them sing.
4. Potato cake - whereas the Brussel sprouts got the heavy hand, the potato cake had no seasoning whatsoever... fried potato.... I didn't get a hint hardly even of salt.

I'm game for a good spend on a perfect brunch. This wasn't a perfect brunch.  Too all over the place.  Girving credit where it's due,  as I feel I did above, I really am glad I vetted this place out for brunch as this inconsistency would have really upset me with dinner prices!!"}
{"text":"Went to Urban Farmer for my birthday as well as father's day.  It had only been open for around a month.  The space is beautiful and elegant.  I found it very upscale for a 'hotel restaurant'.  There were 6 of us in our party and for the most part the restaurant was fairly empty.  We ordered a cheese board for the table.  All of the cheeses were unique and great.  All of the people in our party ordered different steaks.  I had ordered the NY Strip tasting, which was (3) 6 oz steaks.  One grass fed, one grain fed, and one aged.  I thoroughly enjoyed the grain fed the best.  It was cooked perfectly mid-rare.  One person in our party thought there meat was slightly over-cooked than what she wanted.  She had mentioned something to the waitress and the manager immediately came over and had the kitchen cook a new one slightly rarer.  The staff was great and attentive and couldn't have handled the situation any better.

It is very high priced but all in all a great dinner."}
{"text":"Not much to say because we didn't' stick around too long since we were in a hurry. 

For the price, I wasn't really convinced that their lunch is all that good. The pulled pork sandwich was mediocre and the steak sandwich while tasty had probably even parts delicious steak and huge pieces of fat. Definitely not worth more than 10 dollars in my book when I can get the same sandwiches better elsewhere and not have to deal with/pay for parking. I'll probably stick to fries as a side if I come fro dinner because the salad I got was wilted and room temperature... yuck. That being said, if it was fresh it probably would have been pretty good.

The beer selection was limited, not sure why I expected more choices but I did. The lunch crowd was very corporate as to be expected. The average age of customer while I was there was like 45. I would come back to see if the dinner crowd is any different. But I probably won't because if dinner is equally mediocre I'd rather go somewhere that's actually near other stuff to do..."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere, really \"hipster\" vibe which I like. The food was amazing of course. I got a turkey panini with bacon avocado and a bunch of other stuff and it was probably one of the best sandwiches of any type I've eaten. If only I lived in the area I'd go here all the time! -UPDATE, We went here again for dinner and here I consumed the best steak I've ever had. Period. The service was also great, and our server didn't act in a rush despite the place being crowded."}
{"text":"Excellent food, all locally sourced which is very good both for the palate and the earth. The food was well prepared and the service was excellent. One memorable item is their corn bread, brought in a tin can fresh from the oven. Overall great experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the cheddar bacon biscuit with sausage gravy, while the others at my table tried eggs benedict, waffles, and oatmeal. The waffles and oatmeal were nothing special, but edible for sure. The trouble came with the eggs...both in the benedict and my biscuits and gravy. They were undercooked, and the egg white/albumen was still clear, forming a slimy cover on my biscuit which I had unfortunately taken a bite from. The waitress alerted the manager, who didn't charge us for either item. Decent customer service response, but eggs should be simple enough to cook properly. Will I trust this place again? Unfortunately not."}
{"text":"Excellent dinging experience. We had phenomenal service and I really enjoyed the modern, yet relaxed and cozy vibe of the place. I  probably had one of the best dirty martinis I have ever tasted. We ordered the cheese plate with 4 cheeses and while they were good, the plate itself was a tad anti-climactic. 

The steak choices are a bit over whelming, with so many variations but it's good to have options. We went with the steak sampler. I don't remember the exact name, but you got 3 different steaks. I thought that was a neat option to try more than 1 and split. We ordered the medium rare and the one was def more well done, but they were all still very good. I used to be a steak fanatic, but that phase has passed, so maybe that's why they did not knock my socks off. 

Overall, very nice time and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal steak, phenomenal brussels sprouts, unique and memorable bread, and impeccable service. What more can I say. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here. It's a bit pricey, but was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Wagyu ribeye was superb. No topping or anything else needed to complement. Pure steak bliss cooked to perfection. Cheese appetizer was excellent with a wide assortment of high end cheeses. Ordered the roasted cauliflower and creamy spinach as sides which were both excellent. Will return again soon. Arguably the best steak in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at Urban Farmer, despite some reviews about poor service. Our waitress was extremely helpful in making our decision on what to order. She recommended a great bottle of wine, even letting us sample any that were available by the glass before making the final decision. We ordered the small charcuterie which is an awesome starter if you're a little adventurous and want to try some new preparations of meats. My boyfriend and I didn't know much about the different cuts of meat or corn-fed vs grass-fed vs grain-finished and our waitress thoroughly explained all the choices. I ended up with the 8oz grain finished tenderloin (medium rare) and my boyfriend had the 12oz corn fed flatiron (medium). I added bone marrow that was enough for the both of us to share. Both meals were excellent, cooked simple but packed with flavor. She also recommended two sides - creamed corn and twice baked fingerling potato tart. The potato tart was AMAZING, a must have! As we moved on to dessert we were very full so the waitress recommended something on the light side - lemon cheese cake with blueberry sauce. The perfect size to end a delicious meal. We wouldn't have been able to make such sound choices without our waitresses help!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mother's Day brunch.  Nothing on display wasn't absolutely delicious.  

Romantic decor and service was quite fast.  Price was expected ($180/4 including tip)."}
{"text":"It's expensive (but you knew that). And honestly, everything we had was well worth the price. It is, so far, the best food I've had in Cleveland. 
Hit up their happy hour (4-6pm)."}
{"text":"special sandwich of the day, ratatouille panini, was terrific and the side salad with toasted quinoa and blueberries was so good I had no regrets of having it over the fries. My arm was twisted into having dessert and I'm so glad I did - butterscotch sundae was wonderful with a blondie, scoop of ice cream, homemade butterscotch, whipped cream, and a sprinkling of plump raisins made for a really tasty treat. The dessert took much too long to come out, apparently due to a mix up in the kitchen, but it was mostly worth the wait. The atmosphere was a massive, open room with many tables, a huge kitchen in the back and slick decor. Certainly can see why people rave about this place."}
{"text":"Hard not to give this place 5 stars when the steak I had was probably the best I've ever had. I can't give a long review.  I had the 60-day aged ribeye. She had the walleye. We split the Brussel sprouts (which were just ok by the way). Wife said the fish was very good but she devoured the steak I shared with her.  So, great bar, great scotch selection and fantastic beef here. If you come, get the steak. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Urban Farmer was a great dining experience with many tableside food and drink preparation.  Freshness and quality were evident.  Everyone's food was impeccable and met expectations.  The only reason I am not giving a 5 is the bass was a little over cooked for my liking.  I appreciate the crispy skin, but could have been more tender on the inside.  The steaming hot cornbread was amazing and would have been happy with just that.  Scallops and Mac and Cheese sides seamed to be the biggest hits of the table."}
{"text":"Was able to accommodate take-out for 15 people flawlessly. A normally boisterous dinner crowd was quieted by the delicious entrées. I've never seen this crew so quietly consume a meal. Everyone from a gluten free vegan to meat and potatoes all very pleased. Shout out to Patrick and to Erin for helping to orchestrate the meal. Thank you for the happy hearts and full bellies!"}
{"text":"Although the food was fantastic. Price and horrible service make this restaurant a lose lose. We ate here for dinner last night and for breakfast this morning. Same terrible service both times and the prices are absolutely staggering. Seriously four dollars for an Egg and six dollars for an English muffin?! Not to mention my $70 steak last night. I mean seriously!! It cost less to eat at four seasons."}
{"text":"i had a great dinner at this restaurant. i like the fresh food, the service was excellent, and the ambience was relaxing. I would only recommend to lower the music a little, otherwise it is a great place to eat and relax."}
{"text":"We went for brunch today; I ordered the avocado Benedict (so rare to get a Benedict where the eggs are as flavorful as the hollandaise!) and my partner got the shrimp and grits (one of the best he's ever had!). Our host, Megan, was cheerful and superhumanly efficient. Definitely one of the prime dining destinations downtown and supports local farmers to boot"}
{"text":"Great food- had the French toast and homemade chicken cherry sausage and it was fantastic.  Will be back if ever in the Cleveland area again.  The ambiance was the best!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants that I have ever been to. It was recommended to me by a good friend and I am happy that I took his advice. The restaurant itself is very clean and open which is great. It is quiet enough to have a meeting and still have privacy. The steaks that we got were excellent! The twice baked potato was a good side dish and is enough for two people. It is not a cheap restaurant by any means, but you get what you pay for. I would definitely recommend Urban Farmer and I will absolutely be returning there the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Brioche French toast and a side of bacon ...absolutely delicious.  Portion of the French toast was huge:  couldn't finish it.  Don't even need the syrup on it, blueberry compote was perfect."}
{"text":"We decided to try Urban Farmer when we met for lunch with my son who works close by. We weren't disappointed. The waiting lounge has a full bar and wonderfully comfortable leather sofas. Our server was great from the start, and explained the restaurant concept and their wonderful menu. The pork bbq sandwich with slaw is perhaps the best I've ever eaten. The homemade warm chips were to die for. My son had the wagyu beef sandwich and he said it too was delicious. The interior is really unique and welcoming and I can't wait to try it again for dinner.
This restaurant is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I had higher expectations since the ratings averaged 3 1/2 stars. The food left much to be desired and the service was average. 

We we greeted and seated pretty quickly. They brought us the regular menu, bar menu, beverage menu and the happy hour menu. So many options. The happy hour looked tasty with lots of different flavors to try. But the happy hour menu was rescinded 10 mins later since happy hour had ended 20 minutes prior. Rookie move. 

Anywho... The prices are definitely not cheap and the menu looked great. Lots of steak options... so it must be a what they specialize in or so I thought. When I pay that price for a steak, I don't expect to have to add anything for flavor. Two bites in and I had to add both pepper and steak sauce, still just ok. We had popcorn grits which also lacked a lot of flavor, which needed salt and pepper to enhance the flavor also.

A couple of menu highlights were the apple donuts, the mashed potatoes (very creamy and very tasty - which I like) and tomato salad. 

The house pinot grigio tasted like a chardonnay. I would have ordered a chard if that's what I was looking for. Gratefully the waiter honored the happy hour price for the wine since we had ordered it from that menu. So a chilled white wine was still consumed on a warm evening.

All in all, wouldn't come back here. Prices were what I would expect in Chicago or Philly, but without the quality to back it up.  But thanks for the yummy donuts!"}
{"text":"Service was an abomination, they were slow and lacking any sort of excitement especially when asked for recommendations, and just plain pitiful.

The food: we had the meat and cheese plate appetizers.   They were decent.

The real food:  my friend ordered the wagyu ribeye and I the 18 oz new york strip (21 day cure)

I was impressed with my steak but my friends $80 wagyu was probably the worst I've ever had compared to what your expectations are for that cut of meat.

Bottom line the place just seemed disorganized and unsure of themselves; from the staff to the food.  And this place should definitely have a $$$ not a $$ signifier.  $270 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Another 5 star rating absolutely deserved!!! We rolled up in between hours...dinner and lunch. The place was pretty slow. But didn't stop excellent service. We were greeted upon arrival, could sit anywhere where we wanted....we sat at the bar, and was quickly greeted by the bartender asleep. She took our drink orders, and our drinks came out quickly and were delicious. 

After she took our orders, it didn't take too long for our meals to come out. As expected. But, it's always nice, when you get the kind of service you expect. lol. 

Our meals came out hot, had excellent presentation, and tasted absolutely delicious. seriously. For some burgers and a panini....sooo much flavor. Perfect balance of crunchiness and softness. Really good. 

The establishment appears clean. Open flooring. Plenty of space. Pricing was a tad bit on the higher side. But, I'm assuming because we were downtown, Cleveland. However, for the value of the food. I feel it was worth it. Plenty of food for your money too. And my favorite part, the drinks were delicious too. 

That's my five star rating....this place is conveniently located by the stadiums, rock N roll hall of fame, etc...great service, good food, good drinks, nice ambiance, and reasonably priced....not much more I could ask for. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"the restaurant held my transaction for 3 weeks which is unheard of.  this cause my card to overdraft and when i reached out to the establishment they told me they had an issue with the payments and didn't offer me anything as a sign of appreciation.  very poor experience this time."}
{"text":"Inside the new Westin Hotel! Quick breakfast before we start the day. Omelette and yogurt panna cotta. I don't know what they put in the yogurt but damn was it amazing! The hashbrown that came wit hthe omelette was different and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Great steaks.   Awesome sides.  Highly recommend the grits.   Steaks cooked perfect.   Home cooked desserts. Highly recommend. Thanks Urban Framer!"}
{"text":"This place is classy and stylish but whoever gave it two $$ is out of their mind.   It is at least 3 maybe 4.  The smallest steak will set you back 33 bucks. But I was able to get around that by asking for a regular salad with steak on the side.   Even with my hard cider drink the bill was only $34.   And when I was unhappy with the quality of the Cesar salad they gladly brought me a house salad in its place.   Service and atmosphere are both A1.   I deducted a star because of the salad.  Just average.   Good place to go while staying in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"The place to come if you like bugs in your food!

Upon arriving in Cleveland from NYC on our way to Chicago (moving cross country) we were delighted to find a 4-star Yelp rated restaurant in our hotel. Our delight quickly faded.

I ordered the local red wine which was not great, but it was also the cheapest on the menu and Ohio isn't necessarily known for its wine, right?

We ordered the walleye, a Caesar salad, and a few sides to share. Everything was brought to the table at once, including the bread, which we would have enjoyed having while we waited for the rest of our food. It would have been nice to have the salad before the entree, too, but more on the salad later.

The walleye was bland and rubbery, the asparagus was flavorless, and the Mac and cheese was tasteless. The twice baked potato was delicious. 

The Caesar salad was okay, until my husband noticed that there was a gigantic bug crawling around in it.

We looked around to try and find our waiter, who we had not seen since placing our order (no check in to see how we were doing after we were served). After about five minutes of trying to flag someone down, he came by and we let him know about the bug. He took the salad away and came back with another glass of wine for me. I looked in the wine and noticed a bug floating around in it, which I removed with a fork. Like the bug in the salad, it was still alive.

At this point the manager came over and apologized, letting us know they would take care of our meal. We quickly left the restaurant, not wanting to eat another bite there even though we were both still hungry.

As we were walking out, my husband told me that he had swatted a bug off the table right when we sat down. I think this place has a problem with bugs!

After fixing the bug problem, they also need to work on the food and service. Very disappointing, especially after a long day when we were looking for a nice meal to relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here today.  A simple yet efficient menu led me to a grilled chicken sandwich with all kinds of goodies on it as well as a choice of sides - being on a diet I elected to go with the fruit.  Size of this portion was a bit disappointing, but the sandwich itself was fantastic - a medley of flavors.  Being a steak type of guy, I look forward to bringing the wife here at some point in the near future to sample the dinner menu.  Friendly and attentive service staff as well."}
{"text":"Just needed a place to hang out in the morning while downtown. That it was open for breakfast was awesome. They are open for breakfast everyday. This is a breakfast review.

I ordered the eggs benedict. Eggs were perfectly poached with the whites cooked through and the yolk cooked but a bit runny. The delicious yolk paired well with the hollandaise sauce that poured over the warm ham, making one delicious combination. The ham itself was sliced so thin and piled high, that it tasted like a ham version of sliced corned beef. The cappuccino was made with rich espresso, yet not too bitter, and had perfectly foamed milk.

I think dinner reservations are in order."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak medium and received it rare. They did not give me a new steak rather they took the steak they served me and put it back on the grille. Yikes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped into Urban Farmer for a late Tuesday lunch that we hoped would be a special addition to our honeymoon staycation.
We were seated immediately and in short order our server was tableside asking if we wanted anything else to drink, but I realized we hadn't been issued a drink menu. He produced one when my wife asked about wine, but I wasn't prepared to guess at my options and had to wait for him to return with her wine to order something myself.
We ordered the pierogi starter, my wife got the wagyu NY Strip (rare) with a Brussels sprouts side, and I got a tenderloin (medium) with the farm fries side. Our server began asking my wife for clarification on her cauliflower order and she had to correct him as she'd said sprouts, but we thought nothing of the fact he wasn't writing our order down.
Before long our steaks and sides arrived. I was annoyed that our starter was missed, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want it fired and brought to us on top of our steaks, I figured as long as we weren't charged for it we'd just write it off.
My steak was great, I finished it in no time.
My wife's steak, though, seemed underdone... even for rare. It didn't have the melt-in-your-mouth texture we've had before with wagyu steaks, and was actually SIGNIFICANTLY tougher than my less expensive and cooked-warmer steak.
Her brussels sprouts side was mostly quite good, but a little uneven (some very well done sprouts and some undercooked sprouts).
My fries side was a little underwhelming. I'd expected something a bit more...artisan? They were fine, but they were $8 fries with less inspiration than I've found elsewhere for $1.09.
When my wife finished (well, abandoned) her meal we were a little put off by how long it took our server to resurface. We were quite literally the only customers in the restaurant and somehow were being overlooked.
We want to come back to sit at the bar, for the impressive drinks menu and the pierogis we didn't receive, but I don't imagine we'll return for dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had in Cleveland! (and -shhhhh!- I don't even eat steak).

I enjoyed the Ohio Half Chicken which was supremely juicy and packed with smoked flavor. The sides stole the show, though! The baked mac & cheese and potato tart were out of this world delicious. 

Yes, it's expensive but it is so darn tasty.

My cocktail was delicious, too- I hope to come back here for happy hour one day."}
{"text":"Predictably delicious, just like the one in Portland, OR. Thank God! Never mind the reviews within a twenty mile radius, those folks wouldn't know a fine dining meal if it were an Acme Anvil landing on their head. In Cleveland, one must rely on reviews from outside the province."}
{"text":"I had read on Yelp that this place is \"home to the best burger in Cleveland\" and this compelled me to go and see for myself. I can confirm that this is correct. I ordered the standard burger and fries and it was outstanding. It was a little pricey for a burger but given where the restaurant is located and the type of venue I suppose that it is fairly priced. It was also surprisingly quick for a weekday lunch spot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I feel it absolutely imperative that I warn each & all of the unbelievably revolting preparation/kitchen practices at Urban Farmer! While this restaurant was once one of my favorite dining locations, I will never, EVER, dine here again!

On my most recent visit, I sent back a salad. I requested my salad w/o protein, but it still arrived with steak on it. Due to the restaurant's open kitchen design, to my disbelief and horror, I watched as a very angry chef reach full \"flip-out\" mode before  proceeding to SPIT into my newly-made salad dressing, plate everything and finally put it out to be delivered to my table! Obviously, I rejected the salad & refused to continue dinner. 

Shortly after, the manager arrived to our table, listened to our concerns & then disappeared for nearly 10 minutes. It is my opinion that in that 10 minutes, he reviewed the video-feed of the kitchen, for himself. When he returned, he never denied the allegations. Instead he stood there with a look of sheer embarrassment and disbelief, offering to cover our drinks and appetizers, while continuously apologizing and rehashing how long his relationship with the chef has existed. The look on his face was that or sheer terror.

In parting, he assured us that he would speak to the chef's manager as well. After leaving our table, he immediately went into the kitchen and very abruptly replaced the chef with a new guy; leading the other chef into a back area--for a conversation I would love to have been privy to.

Utterly disgusting & unbelievable!!!!!

Needless to say, you may dine here at your own risk but consider yourself warned..."}
{"text":"Had terrible service.. my wife and I ordered 50 dollar steaks and asked for them to be medium. I double checked with the server and she said they would be pink and warm throughout. We received our food 30 minutes later and they were rare... purple and bloody. Upon notifying the waitress they took the food back and heated it more. Are you kidding me? 50 dollar steaks and your microwave them?!?! The manager came out and was terrible. No apology, just a \"what happened\". I'll never come here again and if I wasn't staying at the Westin for an event I wouldn't have come here in the first place. Avoid this at all costs unless your just looking for a drink."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the food here! Breakfast was fantastic and their lunch menu was wonderful as well. Prices were fair for the quality of food you received. My only disappointment was the Bloody Mary. They have their own homemade mix that looks fantastic, but it definitely had a funky taste that was hard to tolerate and it was about $14 for a 12 oz with Titos. They have a specialty brunch menu on the weekends, but their regular breakfast is tons of food, much less expensive, and they have a bottomless Mimosa option where your money would be better spent! We would definitely go back if we're in Cleveland in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time nice atmosphere service was good I ordered the half chicken ($30) but it was way too small our friends had steak that looked and those we're really expensive will not be in a hurry to come back here and you can valet park at the Westin for $10"}
{"text":"If I can make it a half star I would've! I ordered the Caesar salad I asked for the croutons and anchovies (it should've said anchovy or half of an anchovy) on the side they came right on it.  It also tasted like they put an entire bag of salt on it!  For dinner my father ordered the salmon with vegetables underneath which were cold and the salmon was dry!  My steak was on your undercooked for medium rare and was terrible tasting! I'm definitely not recommending this place to anyone. It's a good thing I live out of town. What a misleading review this was with over 300 reviews. Bugs everywhere.  The waitress was very accommodating."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Cleveland. Highly recommend the New York Steak Tasting, in which you get 3 different 6oz. steaks (grass-fed, prime corn-fed and 21 day dry aged) Throw in the Waigu to complete the tasting for a few bucks more. It's fascinating how the same steak can taste SO different, and fun to share as a group and discuss favorites. Baked Mac n' Cheese and Creamed Spinach Gratin make nice shareable? sides to go with the steaks. Sunday Brunch is a hit as well."}
{"text":"$3.50 for soda water off the gun?!  you've gotta be joking my ass. 
Also, it took twelve years for hot sauce."}
{"text":"Thanks for the response, Troy. But since you were the manager I referenced and couldn't be bothered to do the right thing when I visited, saving face on Yelp is of zero interest to me."}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere, with excellent steaks and very good sides. Service was prompt and chocolate torte dessert was also excellent!!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place was interesting. It's a really neat looking restaurant attached to the Westin in Downtown Cleveland but I was left disappointed. First off, Yelp listed the place to be much cheaper than it was, so be prepared for that. I paid $49 for a ribeye, plus got a $15 side for just myself....so $64 for just me. Other people got more expensive items or alcohol. So yes...its way more expensive than the $11-30 per person that Yelp would indicate. Second, if I'm paying $49 for a ribeye, you'd think that it'd be the best thing I ever ate, but it was just okay at best. The steak was unevenly cooked, ranging from Medium/Medium Well on one side of the steak to Rare on the other side of it (I ordered it medium rare). It tasted alright but had very little seasoning on it. A little salt and pepper would have made all the difference in the world. My side of squash was not quite what I expected and was very dry. Overall, I was very disappointed in the steak and squash. I could go to a large chain restaurant and get a much better and flavorful steak with 2 sides for a third the price I paid for my meal. Will I be back? Probably not..."}
{"text":"This is a really nice upscale downtown restaurant with a lot of unique drink options and high end liquors and wines. 

I brought some clients for a night out before a ball game and had a great experience. They have many grass fed, grain fed, dry aged or American Wagyu options. It was nice that Wagyu came in various cuts. Many high end places only give one option. I tried the ribeye and really enjoyed it. Great marveling and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Everyone else in my group got the steak sampler. Which gave 3 - 6 oz. ny Strip steaks with an option to add a 4th Wagyu option. Everyone in my group other than myself got this. It has grass fed, grain fed, 21 day dry aged grain fed and the adder of Wagyu. Massive amount of food. 

The grass fed was the least favorite option which makes sense but great to get to see what everyone truly likes best. Great scientific research. 

We also got the cheese charcuterie which was a good selection of various cheeses and honey. We also got the beef tartar which I had never had before. Visually it isn't appealing and not sure how it could be with raw meat in it but the taste was great. 

Definitely a place I would return to and a place to impress. The setup inside was very well thought out and very visually appealing. I liked how the menu also showed the farms and the states where the beef came from. Very cool that there were some local options. 

Try it out, be very hungry and just get the Wagyu you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great lunch - had the pulled pork sandwich with Brussel slaw. Tasted wonderful. Everyone enjoyed the variety! Only disappointment was the lac of ice cubes in everyone's drinks and having to keep asking for them. Seem like an odd complaint but did the table of 12 all felt the same."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times were very good experiences! It is extremely pricey, though, and I'm just not sure the flavors are worth the expense, but I have had some delicious meals here.

The interior is beautiful and modern. The staff is extremely nice and overly attentive.

I ordered the porkchop medium well and it was pretty dry, so my ask for temperature may have been off, but I've ordered pork this way in the past with juicy delicious success. The pork was fairly flavorless.

This was a client dinner and we ordered various different appetizers and sides, which were all pretty amazing. I would eat these over the meals. 

Appetizers: Sweetbreads are delectable, best thing on the menu. Pork belly is very good. Pierogies were ok, just not a lot of flavor or enough cheesey potato. French onion soup is so good. I was so full after it, though, more of a meal.

Sides: Creamed spinach, best side, so good, not too creamy. The popcorn grits were amazing, so buttery and cheesey. By far the best side. 

Our client ordered the bass which was really small, and he did not seem impressed by. Our team ordered two steaks, one aged which was good, and one creekstone which he said was great.

Overall, it's a great place just be ready to empty your pockets."}
{"text":"What a place for steak!! Wine list from the stars 
Be VERY CAREFUL with your pick of cut and type
I.e grain fed vs grass fed & dry aged 
It will effect your final experience. Also the way it is cooked. Try the candy bacon ummmm"}
{"text":"Saturday morning brunch. Hostess was extremely friendly and welcoming. We got the French Toast, Eggs Benedict (with ham) and Coffee.

French Toast- it was made with brioche bread. If you're anything like me (not particularly sophisticated and limited experience with the \"finer things\" in life) that just means it was this really fluffy thick bread. It had some wild blueberries and mysterious other good thing on top. It was absolutely delicious 

Eggs Benedict- came on a great homemade muffin. Generous amount of ham on it. If I had to rank my favorite meats to eat, ham would be near the bottom. Nevertheless, the ham was fantastic. Apparently they have an in-house butcher so it's nice and freshly sliced. I had never tried eggs benedict before and quite frankly, the bar has been set real high.

Coffee- the coffee was how I want my country to be. Strong and awesome. 

I'd strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch selections with really reasonable prices and the best service ever!!!! Atmosphere was casual and chic. 
We felt so welcomed from the start to the end. 

We ordered flat iron steak with eggs and farm eggs with chicken cherry sausage and toast, both were very good! Highly recommend and would definitely come back again. Just one warning about valet parking: it costs as much as one person's meal! ($11)"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars rather than 1 is because of the cornbread, which is phenomenal. Otherwise, the menu is extremely overpriced and the food quality does not at all match the pricing. Steaks are fine, nothing crazy special. All the fish dishes have strange flavors going on, just trying too hard. Pretty much all of the sides are unhealthy due to preparation with tons of butter and salt.

Overall, this restaurant lacks healthy options and options overall given the menu is so small and caters almost completely to red meat eaters."}
{"text":"My first time here and I visited for brunch. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and specific details about the items we had questions about. All the meals were exceptionally delicious and well worth the upscale prices. I like the decor that fit perfectly with the theme. They even gave us corn seed packets with our bill. Cute touch! Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items and check out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"My roommate is an awesome event planner and through her connections we got invited to the soft opening of Urban Farmer. We were able to try the greens salad, charcuterie, tenderloin (grain fed), mac n cheese, fingerling potatoes and a rhubarb cream dessert. Everything was delicious and service was impeccable. We loved learning about the different foods, farms and flavors - our server Catherine was a warm, welcomed resource for the menu and her direction guided us through a delicious dinner. 

I'm sure my roommate and I will remember this meal always as it was such a great overall experience and fun, delicious way to check out the exciting new places in our neighborhood. You should come here sometime soon to celebrate something special. 

Welcome to Cleveland, Urban Farmer!"}
{"text":"As I like to say, great first impression.  Place had been open literally a week, and yes there are still some kinks to work out, but beautiful space, great cocktails (and the cheese plate was surprisingly good) and enough local and other craft beers to make this a destination.  

Did not try the food beyond the cheese plate, but others who had said the steaks are legit."}
{"text":"Wow....complete disappointment!

$17...for a destroyed croque madame....no sides, egg, wheat bread and arugula?? You f'd up a classic....try again \"chef\"

Our wait staff was terrible, no silverware. No return from our waiter...

Take your noses out of the air and put them on the grill....learn what you're doing before you charge a premium ......do not come here!!

Townhall all the way"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have found the food very enjoyable.  The steaks are tasty, the cornbread is out of this world, the appetizers are exciting and fresh.  

The service tends to be lacking though.  Except for one occasion, each time the server attempted to talk at least one person in my party out of his or her selection and persuade him or her to choose what is the server's favorite (is this a trained sales technique?).  One time, our server even told us his whole life story including details about his day job and how good the benefits are at the urban farmer (we fled without staying for dessert).   Perhaps as the restaurant matures, so will the staff. 

In short, go for the great food and hope for a fair server."}
{"text":"This place had great unique types of food for brunch and dinner. All the wood decoration is also done by a local wood making shop that my cousin owns. You can sit at the huge bar, inside or on the patio. Plus everything to eat is top of the line. It's within walking distance of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Burke airport and a lot of other cool things to visit. 
It's a bit expensive but a nice place to try."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! We were in town, for a work event, and needed some good food/experience to start the night off properly! This did not disappoint, and delivered an amazing experience for both my employee and me. The cheese plate was an unexpected compliment to a fabulous dinner service. I need to find out where they get that brie with the custom made rind... as it was perfectly balanced and one of the best cheeses I've had in a while. 

Oh yeah - the cornbread in a can - knocks it out of the park! Ask for it right away, when you sit down :)

I ordered the scallop dish, and it was well balanced with fat/acid/crunch/softness/chew, etc. Brilliant dish! Scallops are too often taken for granted, and the accompanying salad and sauce made them shine! Good plate chef, thank you. My tech got the walleye and it was cooked to perfection, and seasoned properly too. Everything we had was spot on, and I don't think our water glass got below half full, before they filled it each and every time. 

We also tried the oyster app, and the Chevre Toast app... which started off the flavorful experience right! Highly suggest the Chevre Toast to start the night off right. happy customer, and will be back for sure! Keep it up UF team!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious brunch here before the U2 concert at the nearby stadium. I ordered a sirloin Benedict while hubby ordered a honey chicken biscuit. Both meals were plated and presented nicely. Loved the vibe of the restaurant- not too pretentious, but a nice place to have drinks and/or a lovely meal."}
{"text":"I love it here. It is defiantly expensive but the menu is great. It is a bit more adventurous than the typical steak house meal so be prepared to pay a little extra for but get an experience. The fish is consistently great too if you are not a big meat eater and go with a group."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary on a sunday night and the service was absolutely terrible. Furhtermore steaks were tough and prepared medium to medium well when ordered medium rare. The only good part was the appetizers.  However, I would not recommend for the price point and poor food and service."}
{"text":"This place was OK.  Overpriced but staff was attentive despite busy brunch time.  It was in the hotel we were staying at, and I do think hotel patrons should get a 10-15% discount.  Overall, this restaurant is trying to be too cool and too hip.  I'd rather go to a little diner for brunch."}
{"text":"We have had breakfast, dinner and bar food here at this restaurant 4 different times, this is a review based on all four experiences.

Dinner
1.) 150 day aged steak- has a lot of flavor, cooked well. Delicious
2.) 8 Oz Piedmontese Montana- Poorly cooked, very dry, for $49 it is definitely not worth it.
3.) Side, Twice-Baked Fingerling Potato Tart- order this if you want a potato side, is creamy.
4.) Salad- Summer tomato- Really refreshing. I would recommend this.

Breakfast
1.) Brioche French Toast- It's very whatever, dry and very little compote on top.
2.) Avocado Benedict- Muffin is big and filling, i don't know, its missing something

BEST THING HERE:
SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS- Flavor is amazing and is SUPER juicy.
CORN BREAD - C'mon, it's good stuff! (Comes with dinner)

The reason i am giving it 4 stars is because besides it being a bit pricey for Cleveland, the service was very good, and most of the food was good."}
{"text":"We asked the hostess and our waitress what were their favourite things on the menu, both said without hesitation to try the French Toast, and be sure to get a side of bacon. 

Best damned French Toast I've ever had in my life! It came topped with hazelnut butter, Ohio maple syrup and blueberries, and I ordered a side of bacon. My wife ordered the same meal

This restaurant sources food locally and butchers their meat in house; if ever there were to be a definitive book on bacon, the folks at Urban Farmer would write it. 

In conclusion: bacon."}
{"text":"It was my birthday.  My boyfriend was so happy and excited! He was going to take me somewhere really special!  

When we got there, the hostess said \"I have you down for three- is it two?!?\"  It was my birthday. He was surprising me with my girlfriend from Pittsburgh coming. On the phone he made the reservation for three but it was his gf's birthday and it was VERY IMPORTANT no one gave it away. The hostess gave it away on minute 1. 

Then he asked for olive oil with the bread. Never got it. 

Then his Heineken sat there empty for a half hour. The girls who had wine never waited. 

Then the piece de resistance - his steak was overcooked. Mind you, this is after oysters and cheese and wine....  The bill is now like $270. Even the server was like \"is that overlooked?!?\"  

Never go there again."}
{"text":"For the first time ever, I had to take my food back. My husband and I have spent untold amounts of money on steaks all over the USA, and Urban Farmer drops the ball. We ordered beef carpaccio, chettuerie board, and Chanti wines. For my entree, I had an 8oz 21-day dry aged tenderloin prepared medium rare. The starters and the side of twice baked potatoes were fantastic. However, you'd think they'd know how to prepare a $52 dollar steak before putting it on the menu. I'd say about 40% of my steak was downright COLD. Yes, COLD. It was colder than the beef carpaccio. The coldness of the steak threw the flavor profile of the wonderful meat totally off balance. The server informed me that a medium rare steak at a \"real steakhouse\" is supposed to be cold as mine was. She was incorrect on beef preparedness but continued her self-defense explanations regarding my cold entree. Even a rare steak is never supposed to be as cold as my medium rare steak was. Cool yes; but never cold. The \"real steakhouses\" the server alluded to would not have written off a concern such as this. I had them cook the steak more and I had a medium done steak. As all fine meats going back on the grill, it just wasn't the same. Please do better."}
{"text":"This is a top notch dining experience that all steak lovers of Cleveland must embrace and induldge in. It is expensive, but you can't put a price on perfectly cooked, excellent  cuts of local and regional steaks. Ive tried one of the filets and a 24 oz ribeye (both corn fed). I give the nod to their ribeye, naturally flavorful with great marbling.

Their oysters were great, both your traditional Atlantic and creamy Pacific oysters. They were served with an onion-ey delicious dunking sauce. An abundance of scratch made corn bread was served to us, SO GOOD but tried not to fill up. I also tried their bread crumb crusted cream spinich, become a staple of my Urban Farmer meals.

The cocktail I had (old fashioned) was made well, great touch of sweetness and bourbon to pair with my meal. 

The decor and interior design was tastefully done, very swanky and unique place. You get the feeling when you're inside Urban that everyone else is just plain missing out. The service was on point, compliments to our hot bartender too. 

This is 5 star all the way, bravo.

FYI if you're not trying to spend then go to Outback, this is a go big or go home/ special occasion place."}
{"text":"If what you are looking for in a steakhouse is a selection of cuts from a variety of purveyors further divided among grass-fed, corn-fed, and grain-finished meats, then Urban Farmer is the place for you--and probably the only place for you, as I have rarely seen such detail put into a steakhouse menu.  On the other hand, if what you are looking for is an expertly-cooked steak complimented by tasty sides and an enjoyable meal, I would recommend just about any other top-tier area steakhouse over Urban Farmer.

I went with a medium-rare 14 oz. Creekstone (Kansas) corn-fed New York strip--the only prime-rated piece of meat on the menu (and that in itself bears some attention).  My fellow diner went with a medium-rare-plus 8 oz. Bartels (Oregon) grass-fed tenderloin.  Unfortunately, both steaks were savagely mis-cooked:  My New York strip was easily medium, if not medium-well, and the tenderloin was straight rare.  To his credit, the waiter sensed my displeasure and after looking at the steak offered to get another one cooked up right away.  I declined--frankly, because I did not want to spend the extra time--but the offer to correct the error was appreciated.  (I am unsure why he did not make a similar query regarding the undercooked tenderloin.)

As for non-steak items:  Drinks were excellent.  The oysters were decent, despite the staff misidentifying the oysters as Pacific and Atlantic varieties even though the waiter informed us that only Atlantic oysters were available that night.  I also enjoyed the Apple Doughnuts, set up to rival Red's Doughnut Holes.  As opposed to the latter's pillowy feel, Urban Farmer's take (also served piping hot) offers a slightly crisp exterior covering a soft interior.  The Candied Bacon addition also bears mentioning:  I really appreciated the thickness of the strips (probably as close as I have yet to come to Peter Lugar's famous appetizer slices), but the meat was really tough--almost like jerky.  I did not think the candying added much to the side, and the bacon jam accompaniment gets lost altogether.  I do not recommend getting either the green beans or Farm Fries.

When you are paying $50+ for a steak and $200+ on a meal for two (without wine), the bar is necessarily set high.  And the crucible only burns hotter when you are in a steak-loving town with plenty of able competition from the likes of Morton's, Red, Hyde Park, Cabin Club, Strip, XO, and the soon-to-be-revived Ruth's Chris.  Urban Farmer's commitment to local and organic sourcing is a plus and actually compliments the oft-cited credo of \"great ingredients, expertly prepared,\" but the restaurant desperately needs to refocus its efforts on the latter half of that philosophy to stay competitive."}
{"text":"Home of the floating last call. Even after talking to the manager I don't understand how they determine last call here. Sometimes; no, most of the time, success is measured by your reputation more than by your bottom line. When I order a $12 cocktail and someone starts flashing the lights, blowing out the candles and turning off the TV five minutes after I get my drink, suddenly I don't feel welcome."}
{"text":"The best steak I have had in a very long time.  I don't usually eat red neat, but when I come to Cleveland I have to come here.  It is worth every bite.  I can't wait for the one to open in Philly in November, I will be there opening night!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We went to Urban Farmer for Sunday brunch before a Browns game with high expectations based on word of mouth and online reviews. Let me summarize...

-The most expensive brunch item on the menu was $18 from memory, but our waitress highly recommended just getting the buffet. We did this, not knowing that the cost was an absurd $29 per person. Nowhere on the menu is the buffet listed, so we didn't see the price going into it. 

-Our table did not have silverware and there wasn't any by the buffet area. I had to get up and find someone to bring us silverware since our waitress was nowhere to be found.

-I ordered coffee and never got it.

-Our waitress literally never came back to our table. At all.

-Nobody came around to fill up our water.

-The people behind us ordered off the actual menu, and by the time we were finished had still not received any food. They had to leave for the game and were forced to leave with their food In boxes so they could eat while walking to the stadium. They waited over an hour.

-I had to track down our original waitress to ask for my check.

-The food itself was ok, not bad but definitely not worth a bill over $60 for two people without drinks. Basically a step above a hot hotel breakfast buffet.

Extremely disappointed in this experience to the point I took time out of my evening to write this review. I would never recommend this restaurant unless they take serious measures to improve their service, especially at this price point for a brunch buffet. I gave two stars because the food wasn't bad... Otherwise it would be one star."}
{"text":"Really great brunch, fun bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a friend and ordered a drink while looking over the menu.  The bartender used a jig and gave a one ounce pour, once that happened we closed our menus and went to Red to get a real drink.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Wasn't exactly cheap yet well worth it. The pike and even the corn bread was all delicious. Props to the chef for a good dish that wasn't ordinary yet also not über new age fusion shite. Hard to admit to  even digging the coconut ice cream.  All good in my eyes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and enjoyed that a new place was doing so well downtown without any extra events going on. Everything was fresh, local, and homemade-even the bread. The food seemed like it took forever to come out for brunch food but we weren't in any hurry. Each item comes separate and each item was huge. I was only disappointed that I only got to try one thing b/c my sandwich was so large but the avocado eggs Benedict was amazing."}
{"text":"Brunch and lunch, both great. Rocked the Quiche and then the Shrimp & Grits. Slapped around some bloodies and mimosas on the way to a great Sunday funday."}
{"text":"Trendy, beautiful, pricey, tasty. Pretty much everything you expect in New York. Great place for late afternoon lunch while people watching. I had a lobster roll that was adequate for the price. Saratoga sparkling water was a pleasant treat. Service was pleasant but slow for the amount of people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Restaurant was very clean and staff was great. Surprised how large and nice restaurant was inside a hotel. First five star I've ever given and we'll deserved. Prices were expensive, but you get what you pay for. Only thing I didn't like was trying to make a reservation. I was told nothing until 1030 and when we got there at 630 to sit at bar, it was empty. I got sat immediately. Even the cooks were standing around. I suggest just going in and not making a reservation."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about their brunch. That is all I have been here for, but enjoyed it every time I have gone. The steel cut oats have to be my favorite thing on the menu, although everything is delicious! The steel cut oats are very filling, but hard to stop eating. I would caution to make sure you make reservations though. I have been here without them, but we have been left sitting at a smaller table in the bar area. Although this is a fancier restaurant for dinner we have walked in not as dressed up and we have been okay."}
{"text":"Awful. Salt, salt and more salt. Terrible server- he was worthless. Did not know the basics of the menu at all. Water glass stayed empty, brought entirely wrong drinks. EVERYTHING was horribly over salted; the butter for the bread (chunks of salt in it), the overpriced steaks, the undercooked green beans, and yes, the fries too. Oysters weren't even good. Very disappointing.  Will never waste our time or money again."}
{"text":"During an overnight pit stop in Cleveland, we stayed at the Westin and chose Urban Farmer for both brunch upon arrival and dinner later that evening.  Both were fantastic.  The hostess was sweet, especially to our precocious 4 yr old, and our servers both times were fantastic - nice, great service, accommodating. The food was pretty solid, as well. French toast, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, grilled chicken sandwich w avocado, bison meatball sandwich, fries, chips, spiced nuts-- all really really good.  Great drink selection.  Sitting outside both times was an added plus and the scene was trendy-ish while maintaining an equally relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Menu looked great, but the delivery was not quite there.  Salad was overdressed and dressing on the salad uninspired.  Server was great at the beginning and disappeared in the middle of the meal and didn't return until it was time for the check."}
{"text":"Had the Imperial Ranch Wagyu Ribeye, was Amazing, expensive but that's expected. Cooked perfectly though. Very nice atmosphere, a little loud but cozy. Service was very informative. Felt we got put on the back burner a couple times but we were a group of 6 in no hurry and enjoying drinks"}
{"text":"When this restaurant opened, the selling point was that it used locally sourced meat and produce.  Hardly something unique in CLE.  However, it was worth a try.  Location is not great, and valet parking is pricey.  Once, you get in, the experience is very good.  Upscale steak house feel.  Nice selection of appetizers and sides.  Get the cheese board, if you are interested in tasting cheese before your meal.  Steaks are well prepared, and not heavily seasoned - you are tasting the meat, not the seasoning.  Full bar, good wine selection.  Excellent dessert menu.  Very attentive service."}
{"text":"The everlasting search to experience great brunch spots around Cleveland ended up taking me here on an almost autumn Saturday morning. This is one of those places I've passed numerous times but just never came around to visiting. But this time I'm glad I did.  The brunch menu was quite extensive with multiple choices. Additionally the make your own mimosa bar was a nice touch as well. The champagne is brought to your table in a separate glass and you take your wine glass to the bar and add your choice of fruit/juices for your drink.

This visit i ordered the French toast along with the chicken sausage. Both were very good and I recommend both options. Also i suggest asking for extra syrup on the side. Also I must give an honorable mention to the crispy breakfast potato. It was the perfect blend of crispness and flavor. Do yourself a favor and get one on the side!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5.0
Service: 3.5/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.5/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0 

Stepped in during lunch for a quick burger.  Decent food and service, though nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Went on a snowy friday night. Atmosphere is very nice. Quite Lowbrow Urban. Set in dining room. Very spacious. Service was good not great. Wine is \"OK\" and a little pricey. Out of Foie Gras. Tried to substitute Duck Liver Pate.  Not the same. I'm sorry. Octopus appetizer was very good. Tender and charred. Squash Bisque was very nice. Needed to be a little hotter but I still recommend it. The really amazing thing was.... the free cornbread!!! Served with salted butter. OMG Good!  Had a Scottish Filet. It was very good. No complaints. Brussels Sprouts, carrots and sweet potato - apple casserole were all nice. No desert. 

All in all-- I think its a little pricey but what do you expect? If you want to dine at a place of this quality pay for it. Its worth everything I paid. Very open and comfortable place. Go check it out....."}
{"text":"The food here is very mediocre and over priced. The service is also very slow. Came here because we had a company event in the hotel so we had to eat here a few days in a row. The first night I ordered the local greens salad and oxtail soup. The salad was very boring and a very small portion for the price. The oxtail soup hardly had any meat in it, it wasn't filling at all and it didn't taste very good either. My coworker ordered a burger and they accidentally left the paper that separates the patties on on it. He had a mouth full of paper in his first bite. After he told them they apologized and took it off our bill. 

The next day we had breakfast there and the service was incredibly slow. I ordered an omelette and side of fruit. It was pretty good but the portions seemed really small."}
{"text":"Needed a place for breakfast when staying downtown before heading to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Very few options on a Saturday.  But a great find!  Sat quickly. Good service.  Food was very food.  Filling portions.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict with ham. Didn't disappoint.  Two nice surprises: orange juice tasted freshly squeezed and the crispy potato cake was delicious.  Wife tried cherry chicken sausage and enjoyed it.  Would highly recommend.  A little pricey, but good value for what you get."}
{"text":"This place lives up the hype.  Downtown parking is annoying but for 10$ you can valet here which was helpful on a game day since event parking can be over twenty dollars at times.  The restaurant is beautiful with tall ceilings and contemporary rustic decor.  It almost feels like a restaurant I'd find in downtown Nashville.  On Sundays for Browns games, they have an extensive brunch buffet for 24.99$.  We ordered off the menu and both the shrimp and grits and the cheddar biscuits with sausage and egg were amazing.  I cannot wait to try more of their menu.  The brunch items were reasonably priced between 10-15$ and the drinks were about 10$ each.  This place is a gem because the quality of food and atmosphere are equivalent."}
{"text":"From the time the hostess greeted us to the time we actually sat down, was kind of obnoxious. And of course it was on game day in Cleveland. I completely understand Gameday and walking into a restaurant however, we had a reservation and when we asked if we could sit down as soon as our table was available, I had to go back to the hostess stand to remind them that we were still waiting. 

Eventually we were sat and then had to wait another 15 minutes for the server to come over. She too had an attitude and was obviously miserable from the crowded early brunch of drunk fans.

Food was okay, presentation was what was expected from a Farm to Table restaurant. It would just been a better experience all around if it wasn't on game day and if our server and hostess were a little bit more competent."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations since it's a popular spot in Cleveland. It was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Both indoor and outdoor seating downtown Cleveland. We came here for Brunch and we enjoyed the food not your typical brunch selections. The atmosphere is nice and a bonus was the Bloody Mary and mimosa bars."}
{"text":"Came for a convention. Beautiful restaurant but terrible service! Bar server looked disgusted. Table service was awful. Everyone looked unhappy and it took forever to get attention. Salad was awesome but steak was tough and over (not medium rare). Staff needs training... Servers in particular."}
{"text":"Hotel restaurant done right!  The space itself is well decorated and has a dynamic layout with a great bar/lounge, amazing private dining area with animal theme, and lots of seating options for dining.  The food is always prepared fresh and with lots of flavorful options.  The brunch is my favorite as everything on the menu is great and the over the top English muffins with locally made jams and jellies are the best!"}
{"text":"I'm literally standing outside on the corner of E6th and St. Clair as I type this. The bar is filthy, service contemptuous (I had to ask for a drink menu and then again for a happy hour menu),  and my drink was served with fruit flies floating in it. The ambiance of Cambro's on the bar filled with mystery sludge, and bottles crashing into the trash was only outdone by a server walking by who literally grabbed my arm to inspect a tattoo. Literally blown away. Get your act together."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for my most recent Saturday brunch with out of town relatives. First off, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous yet homey. Truly feels like an urban farm. The booth they sat us in was spacious and comfortable, always appreciated for a relaxing brunch. 

Ordered a Bloody Mary, which had the perfect amount of kick and I'd have probably ordered two more if I wasn't with family! The brunch menu had so many awesome-sounding breakfast, sandwich, and salad options that I had a difficult time deciding. I ultimately went with the shrimp and grits, as it is one of my all time favorite dishes in general. I have to say I am a purist so I was a little unsure about the braised pulled pork and soft-poached egg on top - almost asked for the dish without the pork but decided to try the dish as it was meant to be. Glad I did, because the slight saltiness of the pork took the grits to another level and was so tender that it seemed to melt right into the grits. With the soft-poached egg yolk stirred lovingly into the grits, a beautiful velvety texture was achieved. And, of course, the shrimp were cooked to perfection and had a nice smoky flavor hint from a good char. Overall, one of the best shrimp and grits dishes that I've had. 

The service was very friendly and accommodating (my mom wanted the Caesar salad without anchovies and with plain grilled chicken and they had no problem making the changes). The service was just a little slow for the number of people in the place - seemed to be kitchen/bar issue as our waiter was very attentive. That is really my only \"complaint\". I am sad to be moving away from Cleveland soon as Urban Farmer would definitely enter my rotation of regular spots in the city!"}
{"text":"Great food, host was awesome server not so much.... A 6ounce steak will run you about $48 everything is À la cart so add your asparagus side and Walla you are at $64.80 before tip. Mind you this is for (1) person!"}
{"text":"Had a nice relaxed Saturday lunch last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is laid back casual and trendy with huge glass windows looking out two sides on a downtown corner. It is attached to the Westin Hotel. 

The service was attentive without being overbearing and the suggestions made were spot on for what we were there for. 

They cook from scratch and use locally sourced fresh ingredients, which always excites me. They make their own English muffins that they also serve their burger on. This sounded interesting and we had to try it! We ordered the burger medium and it came out pink, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The muffin was delicious but a bit dense, thick and a tad over powering for the burger. I wish it had had more aioli on it as well, it was lost under the rest of the burger. We were planning to split it and they kindly cut it and served it on two plates with two small bowls of fries... so thoughtful and appreciated! It also came with pickled vegetables which in my opinion were a home run. They nicely cut the rich fats of the burger. So Good! 

They had a Bloody Mary bar, and I had to have one. I liked the garnishes I chose, especially the chunks of bacon and pickled green tomatoes. 

The prices were a bit high. I do understand that it's attached to a hotel which tends to bump prices a bit, this just still seemed a little out of typical range. 

I would definitely recommend a visit and will likely return!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I have been to a lot of the steak houses in the downtown Cleveland area. Urban Farmer, however, is my new favorite.

I was able to make a dinner reservation on OpenTable and grab a few points for account. Easy enough. We were seated right away when we arrived. We got to walk through the bustling bar area (pretty loud up in the front) and made our way to the dining area in the back (quieter, but not an uncomfortable quiet). I also noticed a private dining area that could seat 20-30 people.

We ordered a bottle of red (a cabernet, Bevel, I believe), ate some delicious bread (try the cornbread...ahh yum) and ordered an appetizer. If a restaurant has beef tartare on the menu, I get it. Sometimes it comes out and there's barely any meat. This was not the case for Urban farmer. The plate was covered with a sheet of this delicious blend of the beef, herbs, spices, and cheese and some baguettes on the side. Not your typical beef tartare but damn, was it good.

For our entree, we ended up getting the steak sampler. Yeah, a steak sampler. Corn-fed, grass-fed, and prime rib 6-ounce cuts of goodness. We splurged the extra $30 to add on the wagyu as well. My favorite was the prime rib--I felt that it had the most flavor and was a little on the saltier side. I may have also been biased because that's the first one I tried. 

We did have one issue when we were there. We ordered all of the steaks medium-rare. As I was cutting into the last piece, I believe I heard a cow moo. It was blatantly under-cooked. One of the managers was walking by so we grabbed his attention to see if they could remedy the situation. He immediately apologized and sent the steak back to the kitchen to be fixed, no questions asked. When it was brought out again a few minutes later, it was cooked correctly. We were not fussy over the situation, nor did we complain or request any type of refund or compensation for their error. So we were pleasantly surprised when they told us to choose a dessert item on the house, to make up for their mistake. That is great customer service right there.

Since we weren't planning on getting a dessert to begin with, we decided to be a little daring and tried the Guanaja chocolate pate. It's a mix of dried fruit, olive oil ice cream, and sea salt. Wasn't for me. While the chocolate was good and creamy, it was hard to eat with the semi-hard ice cream. I was also not a fan of the raisins or whatever dried fruit was on the side. The olive oil, sea salt and ice cream was an interesting flavor though and I didn't hate it.

As far as price goes, keep in mind that you are paying for high quality food, service, and experience. Don't be surprised if you pay upwards of $150 for two people. The steak sampler with just the 3 cuts was around $60. Add the wagyu and you are basically paying $100 for just the steak. But I'm telling you right now - it is WORTH IT!

I am excited to come back and try this place again. I've heard the brunch is phenomenal so that will probably be my next excursion out here. Though, there were a lot of side dishes for dinner I didn't get to try and now that I know my favorite steak, I can't wait to get it in a larger portion!"}
{"text":"dig it. Pricey, but hey.. youre located in a well known hotel space and demand is high when youre the only restaurant in the building. 

Breakfast is realllllly good. i loved the hashbrown!!!! so much flavor. and it was in\\ one of those circle type hashbrowns. 

I had dinner here twice too. I dont remember the exact name of it but it was basically a steak sample lol. 3 pieces of 3 different types of steak. I remember one was grass fed. All 3 were delicious, cooked to perfection. Yay.

Its a pretty good spot, with lots of space availability. Only thing is.. theres only one bar. so your drink might take a while if its a busy night.

Theyve got this cute lounge spot.. right as you enter the restaurant on the left hand side. Youve got some sofas and chairs. Perfect for social gathering, or if its down time, you can meet with a client or business affiliate."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner over three days during my stay at Westin. For breakfast I ordered the French toast with Blueberry compote, it  came with two slices of thick-cut brioche bread and was was overall fine and it cost about $20.00 with a cup of coffee, tax and tip, for lunch I ordered a burger, it took 20 minutes to arrive (too long) and was pretty average served on an oversized english muffin that was simply too big so I sliced about half off the top of the bun off then it was fine. The fries were cold and overcooked, they need to reconsider this- cost $25.00 without a drink. For Dinner I ordered the Creekstone \"Prime\" strip steak $54.00-served undercooked and full of gristle; unacceptable for a \"Prime-cut\" of meat, not tender at all and rubbery; overall a very disappointing cut of meat! I've had better \"Choice-Cut\" Strip Steaks. We have no way of knowing what cuts of meat they really use despite what they say, so I'm always suspect. The steak comes with nothing and the side dishes cost $10-$12 Mushrooms were good but too salty, Brussel sprouts were great, but again the fries were overcooked and brown. it cost us $200.00 for 2 people for an overall a fair experience. I would not return for dinner again, but would try them again for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I took a quick trip to Cleveland this weekend and stopped at the UF for brunch on our way home. Fresh, local food...magical. I had scrambled eggs, bacon, breakfast potato and white toast. Seems pretty basic but tasted nothing of the sort. It was clear how fresh each ingredient was, so tasty. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp and grits. Coffee was delicious and both the coffee and waters were refilled frequently. I'd absolutely return for brunch or any meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful little side restaurant for a unique taste. Except for the service and the rancid sewer smell permeating the outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I was there earlier this week and ordered the bone-in Rib Eye and Mac n Cheese w/ brioche crumbs. Food was fantastic. It is definitely on the pricey end, but you get what you pay for here. 
Great ambiance and staff was friendly. Highly recommend if you are looking for something fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Upon first glance this place looks great! It is connected to the Westin. The food is way overpriced, not that good and the waiter was whacked out arrogant. Maybe he did not think I could afford the dinner or something? Not sure...On a separate day I waited at the bar for 15 minutes and both bartenders completely ignored me. I was trying really hard to make eye contact. I do have to say the location was great and close the convention center."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, especially for its price.

I had the ox tail onion soup ($12) and the 24oz bone-in ribeye ($54).

The ox tail soup was forgettable. The pieces of beef were over-cooked and soggy. Ox tail has to be cooked right and should be firm but not chewy.

The ribeye was fine but it's very difficult to mess up ribeye.

The waitress we had was also unresponsive. We had a party of eight in town for a convention. She tried to be polite but couldn't hide her disdain on her face. Maybe she was about to get off her shift, but we were clearly inconveniencing her. Everything from bread to water took forever to get.

With tax and tip and without any drinks my meal was over $80. I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"I've now had dinner at Urban Farmer twice. Our first experience was great. A very attentive server, impressed with the steak and fish options, and overall good experience. My husband and I went back this past weekend and I hate to say our second experience wasn't as enjoyable as the first. 

We were seated practically immediately after giving the name for the reservation. Water quickly followed as did our waitress. From the moment she came to the table I instantly had the feeling of being rushed. Quick to take the wine menu when we said we wouldn't be needing it, also took the cocktail menu immediately after ordering my first drink. I was quick to ask for it back since I wanted to try another beverage. 
She was very quick to take our orders, again it felt very rushed, and not just being an attentive server. 
We ordered, and after having some enjoyable convo with our beer and Moscow mule, which was mediocre at best, served not in copper mug and without a straw, which I found strange. I sucked that down and then ordered the Paloma. Which was crafted differently than I'm used to. The cayenne rim was a nice touch, but again the cocktail was served without a straw. 
Our food came out quickly. 
My husband ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye, the same steak he had his first visit, he said it was good, but nothing to come running back for. I ordered the salmon, which was good but strangely prepared. I typically prefer a simply prepared but amazing piece of salmon. The crusted outside was a nice feature but really underwhelming otherwise. Our sides included the Brussels sprouts, good but not as crispy as I'd like, and also came with raisins, not sure why that's necessary. Other sides were the twice baked potatoes( hubs says it was good), and fries ( which reminded me of fair fries). After we finished our table was cleared quickly, again they must want to flip tables quickly. After our waitress asked if we'd like dessert our bill was quick to follow. 

All in all for the price of dinner and drinks, about $200, I expect incredible service and atmosphere. Instead we both very rushed and underwhelmed. I can't see us going back to UF. We both were happy to pay, leave and head to another spot to grab some brews."}
{"text":"Easy food made hard.  That's it.  I ordered what I thought was a breakfast sandwich for brunch and I ended up feeling like I was solving a riddle.  I will say that it all seems like there's a lot of thought put into it - too much, maybe.  Fennel sausage, fried chicken leg, orange marmalade, fried egg, sausage gravy, bacon all on a homemade biscuit.  Sounds very good in principle, I guess, but it's an impossible combination in practice.  This was a concoction.

I've only been for brunch; this being a meal coveted by the hungover to ease themselves into the day.  This being something that should be easy, approachable.  You impress guests with the familiar, with comfort, with something they don't have to figure out or think too hard.  If you don't do this service right you won't get me back for dinner.  I could only imagine how abstract a burger looks.

Great space, however.  Looks very cool, bar has potential, nice layout.  I hope thy work out the kinks and stop trying to be something other than just a damn good restaurant.  It's Cleveland, and we'll love you for just being you.  Enough with the pretension."}
{"text":"Better places in town for a good steak. 

Service was lacking. With a dining room of maybe 3 other tables with people we had to wait 15 minutes to even be acknowledged. 

The steak was cooked as ordered but it had no flavor. I question whether or not it was seasoned at all. 

The atmosphere was ok but the pop music seemed a little out of place."}
{"text":"Here from out of town. I like the whole concept from farm to table. Food tasted fresh and well seasoned. We ordered the New York sampler, each consisting of three pieces of 6 ounce beef. All of the pieces were absolutely delicious I was just a little upset when one piece was a little overcooked from what I wanted (cooked medium). We also had the bacon on the side with cat roasted carrots, both were absolutely delicious. Had two cocktails also, I had the farmer #5 and that was yummy! We didn't have room for dessert. Only reason why I am giving a four out of five stars is because of the pesky flies where we were sitting. For such a high class, expensive restaurant I would assume that they would be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"Overall the food was decent. The French onion soup is nothing like a traditional soup. The appetizers had too many different flavors going on. The entrees were the only part of the night that were good. The wagyu ribeye was very good and the bone in ribeye was also pretty good. The part that made this a 2 star review was the service. Our waiter didnt introduce himself throughout the entire meal, I only learned his name from the check. The soup was brought out without spoons. We had to eat appetizers off the tiny bread plates as none were brought to the table. He took away the specials menu when we said we didnt want wine. Didnt ask if we wanted any soft drinks. Had to ask for a refill everytime we finished our drinks. Didnt bring the women a drink after she ordered one. Ordered iced tea with lemon and splenda. Only learned they didnt have splenda after they were brought to the table. No steak knives were brought out for the entree. We had to wait 5 min to eat as the womens entree didnt come out with the others. Waiter didnt have knowledge of the menu and couldn't give us any recommendations. My steak was undercooked and the waiter insisted it was what I ordered.We asked for the bread to be packaged up with the meal and were told it would be an additional $3. All in all appetizers were nothing special, steaks were good but the service was terrible. We had to ask for everything from drinks to silverware and everything else. When you spend $300+ on dinner you at least expect to know the waiters name and have refills brought to the table without asking. Not sure if I'll be back for a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant brunch experience.

My boyfriend and I stopped in here for brunch on Sunday around 11 am. Not too crowded when we got there, but it filled up shortly after we sat down.

Sat at the bar. Bartender was busy and barely checked on us. Had to wave him down any time we wanted anything. Coffee was never even refilled. 

We waited over an hour for our food, which was the avocado Benedict and farm eggs. When it finally came, it wasn't even hot. I didn't care much for my Benedict, my boyfriend said the farm eggs were decent. 

It was clear that everyone was waiting this long for food. The entire place was understaffed. It's Sunday brunch, weekend of the rock hall induction, so they should have expected a crowd. 

No apologies for the long wait. We weren't charged for our mimosas, which was nice, but I'm not even sure that was intentional."}
{"text":"The food is so good!!! I got the honey biscuit and it tasted amazing. The coffee was great. The service was lacking a little. The waiter came to fill up our waters and saw our empty cups of coffee but didn't offer to fill them up. Oh well. This was a tad pricey so I wouldn't come back often but it was still very good."}
{"text":"Attended the soft opening lunch and was very impressed. A great addition to downtown Cleveland and definitely recommend checking it out. Will amend once I'm back and things are fully up and running, but love what I see so far!"}
{"text":"Unreal steaks and apps!!!! By far the best steak we have had since we moved to Ohio!!! Beat! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Looooovve this place! My mom wanted steak and so she got it. Located on the corner of the Westin hotel.
Called the same night and made reservations last minute 1-2 hours before and got it no problem. It was a weekday and the place was not busy at all.

This place literally had ALL my favorite things on the menu; Charcuterie, foie gras, ice wine! I DIE!!!! They even had wagyu on the menu!! I never have been so excited waiting for my food to come out. 

My mom and I shared a 24 oz steak. It was huge and more than enough for us to share. Very tender and juicy, beautifully browned. Unfortunately my mom likes her steak well done and I like mine medium rare, we compromised and got medium well. 

The foie was delish. Can't go wrong. My mom loved it and it was her first time trying fancy shmancy food. 

The charcuterie, we ordered a 3 meat option for appetizer. Had a neat spreadable bacon on the side, really fun and nice compliment to the meat. 

The ice wine.. Yum. Can't remember which one but like all ice wines are typically super sweet, thick like syrup. 

I ordered a chèvre cheesecake to go... I could not pass up!! So creamy and goaty-Cheesy and decadent. Ahh!! 

I gush over this place."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The scallops were amazing, my fam loved their steaks and lamb. The fingerling potato dish was terrrrrrrible. By terrible I mean, I could eat it for every meal (too good). We loved our night there..."}
{"text":"You know, the first time I came here, back in October of 2014, I would have rated the place 2.5 stars, redeemed purely by the fingerling potatoes, the corn bread and the service. 

This time, I just had a fantastic steak, extremely generous dessert portions (I highly recommend the apple pie dessert because the ice cream tastes like apply pie!) and the place is now solidly at 4 stars (marred only by the lack of consistency). 

I will definitely be looking forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Pretty good steakhouse. It's got a nice industrial vibe. I got the French onion soup to start and the grass fed ribeye with the Brussels sprouts side. The soup was interesting as they deglaze the onions with balsamic vinegar which gives the soup a nice tartness that cuts through a bit of the richness. The grass fed beef was done nicely and the Brussels sprouts were very good with the walnuts and cherries. Their barrel aged cocktail was fantastic as well. Overall a great dinner and the server Emily was really nice and patient with all of my comments and questions about the food!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I go somewhere really nice twice a year and this time we picked Urban Farmer. It was amazing. She had the steak taster and I had the Delmonico. There really was a difference between the types of steaks. We ordered the mushroom side which was ok but the cornbread they bring you is fantastic. The service was amazing and friendly but it was New Years Day. The manager came by to ask us how everything was and chat about the steaks. I told him we were teachers our for a special day and he comped out dessert. My fiancée said it was the best cheesecake she ever had. It was expensive to be sure but well worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Urban Farmer for breakfast and wow, what a breakfast. I had a simple one, poached eggs and toast but the eggs were amazingly tasty. Not bland at all, they were rich colored and delicious. The toast was nice and thick, served with a grape jam that was not out of a packet. The highlight was the cherry chicken sausage. Sweet and meaty, simply yum.

Great service from my waitress who brought a steady stream of good coffee.

Big props for Urban Farmer. Yum!"}
{"text":"Pretty good service. We had a server who was quite attentive. The salmon entree is tasty and so is the baked potato. The $47 steak comes with NO sides, ridiculous. Overall, the food is pretty good and fresh."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for awesome beef, you will not be disappointed!! The service, food selections, and quality are all top notch. They do their own butchering in the basement - and even make their own tallow candles for the dining room! The portions are huge, cooked perfectly, and the service perfectly paced. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin Cleveland Downtown hotel for a few days for work - the Urban Farmer is attached to the hotel.

I had breakfast in here two mornings, plus dinner one evening, and cocktails a couple of times.

The breakfasts were very good - and very expensive. The first breakfast was around $30+ dollars. The next morning, I ordered one that was less expensive - around $18 or so. The food was very good.

One evening, I had a bowl of soup and then a burger, sans bun (low carb). The soup, I believe it was an Oxtail soup - was rather ordinary, it lacked richness, complexity, and seasoning. The burger was pretty good - served with add ons of bacon and avocado.

Service was hit or miss. Service during breakfast was very good. At dinner - when my soup was served - it was brought out with no soup spoon or - silverware. I had to wait for a server to come by (not mine) and request a spoon. I was brought a spoon - that WAS NOT a soup spoon - and the spoon was dirty. I set it aside and waited - another waiter came by - and I showed him the spoon, asked if it was a soup spoon, it was not - he brought me a soup spoon and silverwear roll (napkin and eating utensils).

One evening - our work completed for the week, we visited for cocktails. I ordered their version of a Manhattan - not a fan of their style. We also sampled the 14 year old Oban and 16 year old Lagavulin single malt scotch. We ordered most of our cocktails at the bar and brought them back to our table since our server was hard to find.

#UrbanFarmer"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin and went down for breakfast one morning and boy am I glad I did! I had the egged Benedict with steak I believe and it was incredible."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu. Homemade English muffins are incredible. Avocado eggs Benedict perfectly done. Also our table enjoyed the burger, turkey panini and the farmers omelette."}
{"text":"Breakfast is wonderful.  Farmers omelet for G and eggs Benedict for me.  Plenty of food for the price and it's cooked to perfection.   Highly recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Well- the house cut chips get 4 stars. Unusually thin and crispy for house cut. 

Service gets two stars. Who knows or cares why it's lame- not terrible- just lame. Almost made me wish it was terrible just so there would be something that stood out about it. Not mediocre. Between mediocre and terrible. In my boat, that's lame. Not good enough to be mediocre but I'm not frustrated. Lame. 

The burger. Huh? Why? Why did you undercook it by a long shot? And why wasn't it browned or charred at all? Why sort of grey-meat-steam-heated like when you defrost frozen hamburger for too long? Why? And why an English muffin that is home made but really thick and not a trace of typical tangy in an English muffin? 

See what I mean? Lame and sort of pointless.

Went for breakfast one morning and bacon was the strangest and closet thing to an expensive food ration. ULTRA, I mean, REMARKABLY dry bacon. As if we're actually the bark of a bacon tree dug up on an archeological site. It went along well with table top that hadn't been adequately cleaned in three days."}
{"text":"Awesome! I went to brunch the other day and it was amazing. My server was attentive to the correct temperature of my steak. Also, the server educated me on many choices of options for the sides. It is a great place to dine. I am coming back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious lounge menu. Had the quinoa salad with honey vinaigrette and the fries cooked with pimenton, thyme, and lemon zest. I will be copying those fries in my home kitchen. Atmosphere and decor was upscale casual. Felt like I was sitting with the cool kids. Would definitely go there for dinner, drinks, or both."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place, though.  First off you must have given us your star waiter...Joe was perfect.  He gave us great recommendations that did not disappoint.  We loved the atmosphere and all of the local focus in the decor and the food.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal. Excellent steaks and sides. The porterhouse and 21 day dry aged NY strip were perfectly cooked and full of flavor. The potato tart was decadent and the creamed spinach was creamy and rich."}
{"text":"Our experience here was good/very good overall. I probably would have given it a 3.5 star if I could.  I got the pacific raw oyster, Caesar salad, Grassfed Ribeye and the mushroom side. My wife got the tomato salad, pork loin, and twice baked fingerling potato side.  We also got the smore dessert.  

The oysters were just ok, with 1 out of the 4 on the plate being a bit gamey and the others delicious.  Smaller oysters than I expected, but maybe that's normal for the pacific variety. 3/5

The salads were very good. Dressing good, plated nicely.  Didn't blow me away though.  4.5/5

The steak was very good. Nice char on the outside, seasoned very well. Little under the medium cook I ordered, but that's ok with a Grassfed steak 4/5
The pork was not great. Large portion, but my wife didn't like the seasoning. 3/5

Sides were big enough to share and I thought were good. 

Mushrooms were seasoned well, but maybe a bit dry. As leftovers, i reheated them in a bunch of Grassfed butter and they came out much better than the day before!
The twice baked potato dish was very good, but according to my wife, to give a 5/5, she would need to want to have sex with the dish! :/   She's a tough one.  4.5/5

The dessert was very rich and lacked the melty goooeyness that a smore should have. It tasted good, but left a lot to desire. 3/5

Service was great. The water guy filled by glass no less than 10 times. Manager asked how everything was. 

Overall 3.5.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. We go the octopus for an appetizer, and I got the duck while my wife got a 48 oz dry aged ribeye. The food was stellar. My only complaint and the sole reason I'm not rating this 5 stars is that the lighting was too dark for our liking. I appreciate dim lighting, but where we sat at least it was overly dark."}
{"text":"Have now been here for both brunch and dinner, and I'd have to say that this place has been very hit and miss.  

Dinner - The cornbread was fantastic!  Probably the second best cornbread in Cleveland.  The steak - it was tender but was cooked too well done.  Also quite expensive, even for a steakhouse.
Brunch - Tried the vegetable quiche, the sirloin eggs benedict, and a crispy breakfast potato.  The vegetable quiche was cooked pretty well, and had a good consistency.  The salad that came with it was pretty decent as well.  The sirloin eggs benedict was pretty awful.  The hollandaise sauce had a very off taste to it, the eggs were overdone and not runny like they should be in a benedict, and the sirloin was tough (!!).  The breakfast potato was a hash brown about 5 inches in diameter that tasted great but certainly was not worth six dollars."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant attached to Westin hotel.  The prices are high.  We ate at the bar.  All food; salad apps came out at once.  $18 burger was over cooked, stale bun and blah."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate breakfast here today and we were not disappointed! I had the shrimp & grits and it was phenomenal! They added pulled pork and a poached egg in the center and it was a lovely change. My hubby had the 2 egg breakfast with chicken cherry sausage patties. He wasn't a fan of the sausage but I loved the sweetness that it added. The Bloody Mary bar was very nice, but if you plan on having more than 1 or 2 olives, then you probably want to take out some of the ice cubes. Our server, Ken, was VERY good! Very knowledgeable and on the spot. I'm not usually one for the trendy \"hot spots,\" but we were staying in the hotel and we woke up hungry. I'm very glad that we ate here."}
{"text":"Strolled into Urban Farmer for lunch and decided to sit around the bar since I was flying solo today. I was greeted pretty quickly with a glass of water. First glance at the menu, this place is pretty pricey. After some debate, I decided to go with the Beef Tenderloin Chili Mac. One, I'm a carb lover. Two, I love chili. This dish was yummy. The beef tenderloin was so... dare I say it? Tender. The chili was the perfect amount of savory. It could maybe use a bit more kick or spice, but that's just me. It was the perfect portion to be satisfied and not overstuffed. I don't know if I'll stroll into Urban Farmer again, but at least this visit wasn't disappointing."}
{"text":"If you are going to be THE most expensive restaurant in town, you need to act like it. 
Starting with the service, this is not just a casual dining restaurant. I expect to be waited on. Not pampered, just be attentive. We constantly had to look for our waitress. The gentleman refilling our water visited the table before anyone's water was empty. The waitress, no where to be found. Go to Red, or Hyde Park and take a lesson. 
Then came the meals. The one highlight was my wife's filet. Other than that, the rest of our party's meal were fair at best. The Caesar salad had no cheese, no taste, and when we asked for pepper, it showed up half way thru. Have you heard of a pepper mill when serving a salad.  Someone ordered the trio of strip steaks. It was dropped off without any explanation of what each cut was. If your proud of your meats, describe them. To top it off, they were ice cold! When you are spending $65 for a steak, you should expect a decent drink. It's insulting when you order an on the rocks drink, and you get a measly barely 2 oz. measured pour. We brought all this to the attention of the manager, who dropped off drinks as we were leaving. There are so many other choices in town that offer better service, better food, and better drinks. Get your act together."}
{"text":"Oh my! They make their own burger buns. The steak and potato tart was amazing. It was worth every bite. It was worth the cost. I'll be looking out for this company in the future."}
{"text":"Once you get past the farm-to-table preaching and celeb chef plating, the food is pretty good. Service is friendly and not a whole lot going on in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here. Loved the atmosphere and the service was excellent. I didn't know much about grass fed vs corn fed beef and our waitress was very helpful and offers great suggestions.
I ordered the steak Tar tar which very good, but a little on the salty side. I love that it was served with a deviled egg. My husband ordered the octopus appetizer, very good.
For our steaks we ordered a strip steak and a ribeye both corn and grain fed. Cooked perfectly and had great taste. No complaints. For a side we ordered the twice baked potato tart. This is a must order. A pastry crust, filled with mashed potatoes, topped with potatoes, topped with cheese and thick chunks of bacon and sour cream was pure genius. 
Unfortunately we were too full to order dessert, but we do plan on returning. I also loved how they presented our check in a farmers almanac. Great experience but I would make sure to ask your server any questions regarding the menu as it was difficult to make a selection on steaks!"}
{"text":"I had probably one of the best breakfasts ever here! Their homemade English muffins are so delicious! Also, the homemade chicken cherry sausage is not to be missed! All the food is locally sourced and the ingredients just taste wholesome. The breakfast menu is vast- Benedicts to waffles, and the options are huge! We were there with a large group and they seated us in a private room with a giant fa table. It was perfect! Our server was incredible, even bringing us pastries to ride the kids over since they were hungry. I want to try their dinner next time! This place is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Well started out wrong....hospitality was like the weather cold and rainy! Burger was ok, hope everything is a kabillion times better for the high end dinner menu. Doesn't cost anything to pay attention!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had their burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and came with really good pickles and fries. It wasn't better than most other craft burger places, but was good nonetheless. Service was good. I will definitely try this place again for dinner, looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Expensive and no a great food.
Squash soup was ok
Striped bass very fishy and unsalted

Nice atmosphere and good service, but i did not like the food at all.

Good selection of wine, also amazingly expensive.

Be prepared"}
{"text":"I have to comment on the interior because it's gorgeous!  Rustic and modern at the same time -- I wanted to dine in every room, haha.  We came for brunch on a Sunday and ordered the Honey Biscuit, Fennel Sausage, and Omelette.  The honey biscuit was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it.  My husband said his omelette was okay but I'd come back just to try the other items on the menu!  I will say though, for vegetarians, there's not much here for you apart from their veggie frittata (which sounds yummy anyway, so it might not matter =X)"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for brunch- Once on a browns Sunday when they have the buffet and this past sunday when they have just their brunch menu. 
The Buffet is amazing, and lets you sample most of the menu. They also have an omelet station as well as fresh fruit. Was really looking forward to it this past Sunday but unfortunately its only available during browns games and holidays.( We will be coming back for it)
So we settled for the main menu which did not disappoint. We had the smoked fish of the day which was Trout and cooked perfectly with capers and pickled onions. The french toast was very nicely done as was my chicken cheddar biscuit. The English muffins are probably the greatest bread item i have ever eaten. We will hopefully return for dinner soon as i imagine it is just as good."}
{"text":"Having one of three Urban Farmer's in the US within walking distance of my home in Philly, I wasn't planning on visiting the location in Cleveland, but the reviews for breakfast/brunch were strong, so I decided to give it a try. The Eggs Benedict was a large portion with a generous helping of ham and very tasty, especially the house-made English muffin. 

I guess I'll have to visit the Portland UF to hit all of their locations!"}
{"text":"I gave this place two stars because the service was impeccable. The food on the other hand was extremely forgetful. The burger seemed like a giant unseasoned, over cooked hunk of meat that was a huge let down for the price tag listed. The shrimp and grits lacked salt, detailing of the shrimp, and heat. The shrimp also seemed like it was boiled instead of grilled, which is shrimp and grits 101. The bar has beer and liquor, and you'll need a lot of it to get over a $65 nasty brunch. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good wine selection, cool decor, lots of space, usually never an issue getting in. We love the brunch, but dinner is equally as good. Meat is cooked perfectly and they have great side dishes and meat and cheese plates. For brunch, they offer a bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"Traveling through Cleveland and decided on this place after searching brunch in Cleveland. This place did not disappoint. I hate one of the best egg Benedict's  I have ever had. Their hollandaise was amaze. Only con is that it did not come with a side. My cousin had the farmers omelette and her quote on that is \"I was blown away about how good this breakfast was\"."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on a day off... this place was fantastic in every way.... the steaks were great and the preparation was perfect. Been to many steak houses and this is top 5 I've ever been to. Can't recommend it any more then to say Peter Luger look out... ... can't go wrong...."}
{"text":"This place is creating something that no other restaurant in town is doing , but they're not doing it well. Wanted badly to like it after two trips.   Service lacks. Big time.  Heard a major change in kitchen staff is occurring so hopefully it will help
Charred octopus had grit....the cheese flight exellent and monger was very helpful.    Wish i had help around the charcuterie  offering which was top notch but again server was defunct (ate in bar area...tier 2 service?)  Very cool scene from lobby to restaurant..fun to hang out afterwards wherever you are comfortable."}
{"text":"The decor is nice but the good things about this restaurant stop there. I went to this restaurant with a large group of family members on a Tuesday night. For a Tuesday the service was painfully slow. My mom and I ordered a medium-well grass-fed steak, which was 50 dollars might I add, and when we got the steak it was burnt to a crisp and did not taste like some premium cut of meat. I would think a fancy restaurant like this would know how to properly cook a steak. I've had better steaks at Applebee's. 

Other members in our party got the green bean casserole, the potato tart, and the Mac and cheese as side dishes. The green beans in the casserole were very hard, as if they weren't even cooked. The potato tart was pretty bland. The Mac and cheese wasn't bad, but it's kind of hard to screw that one up. 

Bottom line is I do not recommend this restaurant. Way too overpriced for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I had duck and it was wonderful!  My husband had a steak sampler featuring corn fed, grass fed and a combo of both and it was interesting to taste the differences in the meats.  The server was very attentive and friendly, as well as extremely knowledgeable.

The atmosphere was trendy and rustic at the same time.  It was attached to a hotel so served as the hotel bar as well.  

We did make a reservation through open table but didn't need it as there was no wait (we went on a Thursday so that may have been why)

The portions are large and come family style.  I ordered a salad and we both ate it and there was still some left.  Be prepared to share your sides!

The only down side was the price.  We felt that although the meal and service was really good, it was very pricey based on the atmosphere and location. 

They did, however, give us a packet for carrot seeds with our bill which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner, passing through town staying at the Westin. The steak was just ok, the brussel sprouts were really good.  Pricey, but not unexpected for a steakhouse. Would like to have had a topping (blue cheese), but couldn't bring myself to pay the extra $6."}
{"text":"Most of the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The Ohio Ribeye was delicious and I should've paired it with the asparagus (as the server had recommended) because the bok choy just wasn't so great. When my server (Nancee) returned to ask how I liked everything and I said I wasn't a big fan of the bok choy, she quickly offered to replace it with the asparagus which was indeed much better and has a kick. 

Be sure to strike up a conversation with Mike in their Charcuterie -- not only is he a wealth of knowledge but he will excited they share it with you. He told me that their manual retro-looking meat slicer cost as much as his brand new Kia. The very sweet hostess let me choose a different table than where she had originally taken me with a can-do attitude while also accommodating my iPhone charging as it was down to 1%. Without hesitation or frustration she simply unplugged her company iPad at the hostess stand and charged my phone over the next 30 minutes or so (Only after first taking a lap around the restaurant to see if she could seat me near an outlet). Another server who'd just flipped around from having delivered someone's check, offered to walk me around (guide me) towards the restroom... Instead of just pointing like most people do today. There was only one exception to this but nearly all staff members delivered just the right balance of friendliness and professionalism. It's a beautiful place with great food - albeit \" steakhouse-pricey\" - and dependable service."}
{"text":"So I just finished my soup and salad at the bar. I stopped in after the West Side Market thinking I would enjoy some of the local products I had just drooled over. Not the case. I really wish I could say something wonderful about my lunch, but it was completely forgettable. I ordered the celery soup which arrived cold and at the same time as my salad. The soup had great flavor but obviously sat while someone overdressed my salad. The Cesar was dripping with dressing and nearly a third of the lettuce was wilted. It looked much like a bag salad from the grocery store that had been sitting for half the week and kicked around the shelf. I'm giving this visit 3 stars; 2, only because the lunch and happy hour menu was so limited and the initial server did not come around to ask about my food or give me an opportunity to order additional food and 1, because of the decor. I will try this spot one more time if I'm able to for dinner, but due to the blah experience I may avoid it as to be able to experience something that may not disappoint. 

As far as pricing, not bad if the food was up to par. 

Good luck hope your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"I'm definitely coming back for dinner. I only tried lunch.

The menu was very flexible with salads and burgers and other items all of which for a table of 6 were expertly prepared.  This wasn't brought to the table with speed; no what we received was food of the highest quality.  I tried the salad with some beef on the side and it was best described as delicious.  I say that because the taste was great but the quality appeared greater.  The price was fine as well.

If you have the time and want a lunch where the quality of the food iso the highest grade walk over to the Westin and try this place.  The service was attentive and although it may take a couple extra minutes for lunch one is rewarded with food that is pleasing and will clearly reduce how much one can eat for dinner."}
{"text":"Was told by the manager Troy that I would receive a gift certificate to come back to Urban Farmer and try it again. I gave him my address and everything and have never received anything. Unfortunate that I will never go back there"}
{"text":"Our dinner group went here on a Friday night.  We loved how they decorated the place, very interesting, lots to look at.  The service was very good!  All of the staff members were knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.  They have a great cocktail list and they are all well made.  The food is very good, BUT, it is very over priced.  You get a steak for $50 with no sides.  The sides are between $6-12.  Typically our group orders a couple of appetizers and then main courses and desserts.  We did not do any apps and only a couple did dessert.  The desserts were just ok.  We had the strawberry panna cotta and the coconut ice cream.  Bottom line, we will not be going back.   Just not worth expense."}
{"text":"I had the Ohio Half Chicken which was very good.  The prices were expensive, but that is understandable in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I came in for a lovely steak in a Thursday evening at 9:10 only to be offered a bar menu.  Bar menu was garbage.  They closed the kitchen just as several other patrons were walking in.
Cavs game was on, I had travelled a couple hours and was excited to get the full \"vibe\" of Cleveland while eating a great dinner.

Total downer as I was traveling for business, had an expense account and ended up with a charcuterie plate.  (Which I usually live, but not when I wanted a steak)."}
{"text":"Very cool concept, hip environment, great menu selections, and good service all around - however, the kitchen does not live up to expectations.  The restaurant concept itself is a very good idea - farm to table menu (with a focus on grilled steaks) in a contemporary setting.  Several larger table seating options for larger parties.  The restaurant offers a wide selection of cuts of steak to meet any preference.  They do offer several grass fed steak options which is a bonus and not common in the food scene in Cleveland.  

For appetizer, we ordered the cocktail shrimp - although this is a different take on the traditional shrimp cocktail, it was not anything too unique.  For the main entree, we decided to go with the New York Strip steak sample, which is basically strip steak from 3 types of beef - one grass fed, one corn fed, and another dry aged.  Personally, I think this would be a good dish to share amongst 2 people as the quantity is perfect for 2 individuals and additionally, you can order a different cook for each of the steaks, so if your partner enjoys a more well done cook and you like medium rare - this would be possible as these are separate cuts.  The recommendation here would be to get the grass fed beef cuts medium to medium rare as these tend to be less fatty.  For those who like medium well or well done, would recommend the more traditional corn fed cuts of meat.  The cook of the meat was on point, however, we did not feel the quality of the steak for the price point and additionally was not a big fan of the seasoning.  We also ordered the grilled cauliflower and sauteed mushrooms as sides - both were above average.   

Overall, no huge complaints for the restaurant, however, the food provided by the kitchen did not meet the expectations based on the with the restaurant environment or price point.  The restaurant definately has potential - the menu is on point and environment is great - just need to get the food amped up."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I love food and all different flavors so my review is simply based on good or bad taste and not preference in ingredients. I ordered the octopus appetizer and scallops dish. I love seafood and how fresh and light the preparation of it is. Unfortunately this was far from it. I can't say that anything was wrong with my food besides that it simply didn't taste good. I just picked out the seafood and left the stuff that came with it behind because it paired awfully. Good thing my husband ordered a side of French fries, I would have been starving after spending $50 on a few bites of seafood. 
My husband ordered the stake sampler which was also disappointing.  If you know how to grill a steak yourself at home, you're better off doing that and saving another $60. 
What saved the night was the mint chocolate cake! 
Before it arrived we were saying how we'll never be back but after a few bites, we decided to come back for the cake only!"}
{"text":"Food and service were deplorable a few Fridays ago when we went for dinner. We ordered a bottle of wine, a salad and the steak tasting, with a few added sides. When you pay $150+ for a dinner for two, you expect the kitchen to get things right. Our steak was attempted 3 times before they came close to getting it right - first time it was ice cold, prepared to medium well temperature, second was RARE! We had asked for medium. 

At any rate, the third time it came out, we just gave up and ate it

Our waitress was atrociously awful. Took her a half hour to get our wine - ordered at the time we ordered everything else. The salads arrived before the wine. 

So the dinner was paced inappropriately, cooked poorly and not worth the hype. To his credit, the manager comped us some desserts, but we aren't dessert people. Didn't expect it. Didn't want it. But it was nice to offer."}
{"text":"It was super easy to make a reservation online, I was surprised I could get one for New Year's Eve at 7:30pm just 2 days before . Walked in and was sat down immediately, service was great and the food was even better. I knew going in it was going to be pricey but for a steakhouse like this one it is worth it. I also enjoyed how convenient it was to pay for the valet parking through your bill."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks on a Friday night and was very impressed. Loved the modern rustic decor and had a couple really great cocktails and a charcuterie board as well. The menu looked great and I would definitely love to return and try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"after a horrible experience at greenhouse tavern, my fiancé and i walked over here in a blizzard last night. i had been here once, last summer, with my family who was in from california. my fiancé, before moving to cleveland, had stayed at the westin for work and ate at urban farmer several times during his stay and absolutely loved it. 

our waitress was tall and blonde and an absolute pleasure. she took the time to double check every single thing in regards to my food allergy. 

here is what we had to eat;

6 east coast oysters - they don't give you the location the oysters are coming from but regardless they were absolutely delicious, mild and subtly sweet. 

caramalized carrots - these were so delicious and really gorgeous. i am a huge fan of crunchy vegetables and am very disappointed when places over cook them so these were such a pleasant surprise. the addition of beets was a really wonderful touch. i could eat these everyday. 

mushrooms - yum! what's better that steak and mushrooms?! can't go wrong there. 

candied bacon - delicious like candy. a little tough / hard on the edges but nothing major, i won't tell if you don't. 

bone marrow - omg this was without a doubt one of the best things i have ever tasted in my life. if i could drink this, i would, everyday. i had never had bone marrow before and my fiancé ordered it for us to split. i will note that it's seasoned (to perfection) and has a delicious mustard finish. omg thinking about this makes me just want to walk back over. 

steaks - i had the Piedmontese medium rare and just wow. one of the best steaks i've ever had in my life, and dipped in that bone marrow, incredible.  my fiancé had the 18 oz new creation 42 day dry aged steak. perfection. 

we had such a wonderful time here. our waitress constantly checked in to make sure everything was delicious, and it was. we didnt want to stop the fun so we went to the bar to watch the end of the cavs game. one of my favorite after dinner drinks is a coffee and a shot of frangelico and the bartender actually made me a drink out of this (shook the coffee and frangelico in the mixer) and served it over ice. SO deliciously frothy and i had never even thought of that. 

all in all, everything was so absolutely fantastic. i can't wait until summer so we can sit at the picnic tables outside."}
{"text":"Excellent food the steak trio excellent dish to share!     Appetizers to die for and sidesnalmost as good as thr steak"}
{"text":"Standard urban farmer. Bone marrow was good. The fromaggier--- mediocre. Maybe because we came here just after it opened but I just wasn't blown away by the quality. The only good thing about this spot is that it was new."}
{"text":"We were there on a Friday and it was packed. Loved the ambience. Very classy. It occupies a niche which Cleveland had been lacking - the laidback, ubercool lounge/restaurant. We had to wait a bit before we were seated, so we got some cocktails & hung out in the lounge area. 

Good collection of cocktails & an extensive beer list (draft as well as bottles). Charcuterie was pretty good. Charred Octopus: Pure culinary delight. Probably the best appetizer we ordered. Beef Tartare was excellent as well. For the main course I shared the New York Steak Tasting (6 Oz each of Creekstone corn fed, White Oak grass fed & Ohio proud steaks). Every single of the three steaks was good but I loved the 'corn fed', it was simply above the rest. For the sides we had asparagus & twice baked potatoes. We were too full to order desert. 

It's a must go & gets the top billing from me. Great addition to the ever burgeoning Cleveland food scene. Will be back for more !!"}
{"text":"Just another upscale hotel restaurant with over priced food and subpar service. I was pretty excited to finally try this place, but nothing was memorable. The service at 1pm was non-existent and out of communication. The food I ordered was nothing memorable and regret getting it for the price paid."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a person who lives in Cleveland.  Our meal started with the charcuterie & it was great. My husband & I split the steak sampler with the wagyu steak, so you got four 6 ounce steaks to try the difference. All were good & perfectly cooked.  The side of squash was okay.  Next time I am there I now know which steak I prefer & my husband does too & funny thing,  they are completely different. We really enjoyed this restaurant & will return!"}
{"text":"Great vibe,  very good food. Ed the bartender is a rock star.

Excellent selection of drinks made with real fruit and juices. One of the best selections of bourbon I've seen in a while."}
{"text":"This place was unfortunately not all that I hoped it would be. Decor was unique, service was great. Drinks expensive but decent. 
Food. For apps we got cornmeal crusted shrimp... Decent. Cornbread was complimentary and pretty delicious but its hard to go wrong with cornbread. I'm not a huge steak person so I got the duck- flavor was so-so and it was really tough. Everyone else got steak.... Wagyu was supposed to be amazing but turned out to be standard- not as flavorful and succulent as anticipated. 
Can't remember the other steaks at the table but all equally unimpressive. 
Sides...Mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and fries were all average. 
Overall didn't think it was worth the price and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very hip new chic restaurant located in the Westin (formerly the Crowne Plaza) in downtown CLE. Idea of restaurant is to serve as much locally grown and raised produce and beef as possible. The decor was awesome, as the tables were picnic table like and the lights and wall decor were really interesting. While siting at our table waiting for waitress, a very bubbly lady pushing the cheese cart came by and told us all about the choices, which we were sold on and tried 3 varieties (at $6 per selection) Well worth it as she paired something with each cheese and used the terms \"explode in your mouth\" and \"Flavor orgasm\" which put the selections over the top. 

Was then educated on the differences between grass fed and grain fed beef and ordered the 12 oz strip steak and the twice baked potato for side. The sides are large enough to share and the steak needed no additional seasoning or flavor. Was AMAZING! I do enjoy a good steak on occasion, and this trip quickly vaulted the Urban Farmer to the top of the list. 

Wait staff, bartender and cheese expert were very friendly and were constantly at our table despite going on a Saturday evening. It's not cheap, but you pay for good quality and we will surely return to this gem."}
{"text":"Wow. I am in love with this place. I wish I lived closer so that I could eat here regularly. We showed up for Sunday brunch around 9:15am without a reservation, which was not needed at this time. The restaurant is attached to the Westin hotel and is beautifully casual. You can see into the kitchen and into  a storage area where they keep colorful canned fruits and veggies. I ordered the Honey Biscuit, which included a fried egg, sausage gravy, crispy chicken leg, and a split sausage over a large biscuit served with lemon marmalade. My husband had a sausage and steak hash and a side of these amazing, giant English muffins. The muffins came with assorted marmalades, including one made with merlot. It was to die for! The food was so perfectly seasoned and full of complex flavors. Our waiter, Joe, was friendly and appropriately conversational too. I didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"The stellar food and great steaks (I thought they were better than at Red) were unfortunately ruined by the bad service. Sweetbreads were the only dish I can't recommend - they were dry and over cooked. Our waitress was super friendly but was set up to fail since she looked to be serving other big parties in addition to ours. With plenty of servers milling around and plenty of empty tables, there should have been better planning on the management's part. 

Our food took 1.5 hours to appear. Some meals came before appetizers. Some people got their meals long after the rest of the party. We didn't even bother with desserts after spending nearly 3.5 hours in the place trying to get apps and meals. At the end, we couldn't even get the check in a reasonable amount of time. Our group was itching to leave after this frustrating experience. On the plus side, the server knew better than to try adding an automatic tip."}
{"text":"This place is a class act! Have been there now twice for brunch and fell in love with it the first time. The second time we brought friends back and found out one of our favorite menus items, the French press coffee, was no longer on the menu. What made this coffee so special is they served it with little containers of candied orange rinds, cinnamon, shaved chocolate and freshly whipped cream. It was amazing! The manager, Erin, stopped by our table to ask how everything was and we expressed how we loved the food but missed the French press. They took it off the menu before she started working there so she asked us all about it, what was included etc and said she'd take our feedback. Well to our huge surprise, she delivered to our table the French press with every container of deliciousness! Best.coffee.ever!!!!!! The food is amazing too!!!  Class act, amazing service and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Side dishes, corn bread and French onion soup was excellent. Steak was average at best and way over priced."}
{"text":"Had brunch at Urban Farmer for Mother's Day. They did a phenomenal job; our server Lisa was friendly & attentive and the food was hot & delicious. This was our first time there and I would certainly return. Management stopped over a few times to ensure everything was good and I was impressed with their sincerity. Worth the money for the value and experience. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service tonight. In town for business with a colleague and just popped in for a drink at the bar. We were impressed with the selection of local craft beers and decided to stay for dinner.  The Skate seafood dish was amazing.  Definitely will come back for more next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch and was very, very pleased.  Everybody really liked what they ordered (benedict, french toast, cheddar bacon biscuit)... The bloody mary bar was awesome, along with the service.  Great atmosphere, and local food sourcing was a big plus.  The dinner options don't seem to have as much variety, but after such a great experience, I think I would give it a shot."}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is your stereotypical upper class bar and restaurant. On this visit, we went for drinks. The drinks were all extremely strong and lacked the extra oomph to make the strength enjoyable. With an Apple cider whiskey drink a little spice to round the drink out would have been nice to take the sharpness of the whiskey out. We also had their seasonal drink, a Cafe Cleveland, though it was altered to accommodate food allergies. Overall a fun drink to get with table-side fire and theatrics, the actual drink was a little lackluster. It tasted strongly on straight vodka with an almost burnt, bitter coffee follow up. 

Three stars goes for the fact the staff was accommodating and experimental with food allergies. This alone makes the restaurant worthwhile though their drinks need a little more finessing to compete with expanding craft cocktail market in Cleveland.

As for food, they do use latex gloves in their preparation, so I was unable to try anything as they did not have a latex free option. Here's hoping they move to latex free in the future!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far my favorite in Cleveland.. the hostess, staff, and management were absolutely wonderful.  Two of the managers personally came to our table to ask if we needed anything or had questions.. I was VERY impressed with how professional and polite they were as well as our server!! Now onto the food.. everything was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the butternut squash soup and the rack of lamb my boyfriend ordered the porterhouse steak on special because it was farmed in his home town (HOW AWESOME IS THAT?). Everything was sensational.  I can't wait to come back! We didn't have a special occasion to celebrate, but the food, service, and atmosphere made it seem like one! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious but the portions are out of control - I ended up packing over half of my plate to go!  The service was questionable - we had a group of 10, and instead of having 1 server, they decided to split the table in half. By the time our side of the table got to order drinks, the other side of the table already had their drinks and were ordering appetizers. I'd highly recommend the cheese platter and the chicken cherry sausage!"}
{"text":"We came in about 3pm and the hosted didn't seem too thrilled. She said something about how they were only serving a small menu in the bar area. We found a nice spot, our server was attentive and the food was good. It just wasn't a very welcoming vibe."}
{"text":"Very cool place. The yelp indicator of 2$$ is incorrect. We waited for an inordinate amount of time for a party of 5. (We did not have reservations.)   It was a Saturday evening in downtown. When they finally came to seat us, all that was available were picnic tables outside and it was very windy. We then looked at the menu and the entree prices were $35 to $70 per entree. We did not want to have a fine dining experience on a windy patio at a picnic table."}
{"text":"Steaks, salad and cheese were fantastic. Chicken was inedible... but 4 stars because I should have read the reviews and had the steak."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the lobby of the hotel I was staying in (The Westin) so tried it for a quick lunch before heading to the airport.

Got the burger, it was very good. Substituted the green salad for fries and it was amazing. Real greens, none of that iceberg lettuce crap that is just water, this was real greens with tomato and radishes in a nice light vinaigrette. The burger was really good too but I kind of wish I just got a large green salad instead, it was that good. My wife went here for breakfast and enjoyed it.

Recommend it if you are in the area and need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Tonight has to be the worst I've ever had. Happy hour ends at 5. They can say they offer one but no one who actually works can enjoy it. I ordered the artic char was so over cooked I returned. The cheese burger is served on a rock hard English muffin. Might as well have served it on a floor tile.  I've had good steaks in the past but I don't be back to find out if they are still good. Restaurant is too expensive to not be consistent"}
{"text":"Wonderful place that serves real, delicious food with a modern, artisan edge. Loved the option, when I visited Cleveland, of having a farm to table restaurant where real pride was put into the menu. Beautiful atmosphere, as well as service."}
{"text":"I had no idea I'd be enjoying a meal right up there with the very best I've eaten in my entire life in the heart of (wait for it) CLEVELAND, but it happened no less than three times last week, because after trying UF once, I never bothered to eat anywhere else.

In town for a conference, I happened to be staying in the hotel that houses UF so trying the restaurant for dinner was no stretch. I was impressed by the decor - just the right balance of urban rustic, and very satisfied with the drink menu; a lovely combination of nuevo, craft cocktail-delicious and vintage throwbacks. I appreciated the menu as well, but that appreciation turned to rabid fandom after my first dinner. In order to save time, I will present my perfect meal - the compilation of three dinners at UF:

Cheese plate - charmingly assembled table-side with care and precision. And it's cheese, so, yeah. Yum.

Cornmeal Crusted Shrimp with bacon, corn, and green tomato jam - such a crispy, smoky, tangy flavor. This appetizer was a surprise and a delight.

Tomato Salad with manchego, stone fruit, and balsamic - the cheese was a perfect compliment to the salad; nutty and delicate, and now I know that stone fruit should be in every tomato salad from here to forever.

Twice-Baked Fingerling Potato Tart, aged cheddar, bacon, and chives - Who knew the simple potato had so much potential. I could eat this every single day. 

14 oz Creekstone, Kansas, corn-fed NY Strip with Maitre d' Hotel Butter, Italian truffle - perfectly prepared and dialed up to amazing through the magic of truffles.

All of the above would have been more than enough, but UF has a passionate and inspired pastry chef whose offerings were a fantastic surprise. Making use of seldom used ingredients, or more typical ingredients in unexpected ways, this course is the one that I keep coming back to. The Rhubarb Souffle with ginseng creme anglaise was outstanding. The Great Lakes Barley custard with hops, honeycomb, and barley malt was memorable, but the GUANANA CHOCOLATE PATE with dried fruit, olive oil ice cream, and sea salt was singular and unforgettable. I hesitated to swallow the pate because I was so enjoying the wonderful complexity of each bite... Heaven.

Cleveland ... it is my deep gustatory regret (but caloric pleasure) to know that it will be a while before I am able to return, but I guarantee that I will be back. Save me a table."}
{"text":"I want to first say that my fiancé and I are HUGE foodies!  We love to tackle the latest eateries in town, and see what there are all about.  Over the weekend for an early Valentine's Day dinner, we went to the Urban farmer for cocktails and supper.  I was surprised by the ambiance of the bar/restaurant .  Cozy, and inviting. Changed for dinner and returned to be seated in the back room, which was super funky and eclectic.  My only problem with this restaurant is that the waiter did not ask us if we had been before, and did not explain the menu.  That was really disappointing to us.  the prices were fair for the food, just wish we were treated better for the money we spent.  That being said, we marked it off the list and will not return."}
{"text":"I had cavatelli here during lunch and it wasn't very good. As a huge pasta fan, I had more hope for it. While I know it's not what they are known for, I still think it should be good if on the menu. 

They did a great job taking care of a big group of us from work over lunch. They also offer valet parking which is nice."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for way too long with no server yet to appear.  We arrived at 9am to a basically empty restaurant.  Coffee arrived at 9:30.  10am and no food yet. Breakfast menu is overpriced( $16 for 2 eggs and a side).  Eggs for eggs Benedict cooked solid - no runny yolk at all. Will not repeat this mistake.  Should have had the breakfast at the Hilton"}
{"text":"It is always hit or miss at Urban Farmer; sometimes it's fabulous and other times it's just a hotel restaurant. First and foremost, the kitchen never disappoints, the food is always great! It seems the front of house operations needs a refresher course on service. Today, the hostess was less than hospitable, not necessarily rude just not keen on being interrupted by customers. Our server was okay, but not very attentive. We could see the kitchen from our seat and when my order was ready it just sat, long enough that my burger and fires were cold when delivered to the table. Another order of fries was made after I requested it, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place. The only thing that was expedited during our dining experience today was how fast our bill was presented and processed. The food is the only thing that keeps us coming back, but with so many other great choices in Cleveland service is as important as food and Urban Farmer's service is slipping."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: really cool and really in tune with urban farm to table theme. They even had shelves in the back showing all the pickled items.

Service: was pretty good Albeit a little bit awkward

Price: a little bit pricey given the style of restaurant but that's what you get when it's attached to a very nice Weston

Food: super delicious and had really good balance acidity. We had the farm burger. They were really delicious despite the uneven cook. The marinated shrimp was really quite delicious and I would order it again."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!

-The restaurant was very clean (big plus in my book, I loathe filthy restaurants)
-Our server was wonderful
-They have a build your own mimosa bar! 
- Chicken cherry sausage (made in house)
-The best shrimp and grits ever!!!!

Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is conveniently located next to the Westin. You can sit in the main restaurant area and enjoy your meal, or you can take a seat at the lounge for a quick bite.

If you are a vegetarian like myself, you have the option of ordering a vegetarian pasta entree. The first time I did this, the pasta was over-done and the sauce was too thin, but the second time around I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Okay, please do not judge this restaurant because it is attached to a hotel. This is not a hotel restaurant. We had brunch there on Saturday and loved it so much we came back for brunch the next day! There were so many fantastic sounding menu items, we knew it warranted a second trip. The entrees are big, but you're going to want to try everything so perhaps come with people who share their food. The avocado benedict was so good it made my husband emotional; the cherry chicken sausage and housemade English muffins were standouts. The red flannel hash was a fun twist on tradition. Excellent coffee and a good Bloody Mary bar. If you're in Cleveland on a weekend, make it a point to come here!"}
{"text":"Really love the atmosphere here. It's fun, servers are nice and food is always really great. Their biscuits are amazing here. They also had a really phenomenal Bloody Mary bar, something I can't wait to share with other people. The only things that I'm not a huge fan of is 1. They only really advertised their mimosa bar, nothing else from a drink perspective. 2. It was actually pretty chilly in the restaurant. I would have made sure guests were comfortable! Definitely will be back, they support a lot of local non profits, which matters a lot to me."}
{"text":"Both breakfast and dinner are great at this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and a welcoming atmosphere adds the positives to this restaurant. Very nice cocktails available and the cuts of meat were impressive too. Definably recommend this place for any special occasion or dinner night."}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is one of our go-to brunch spots! His instant favorite is the cherry chicken sausages! He is obsessed! I love anything that comes with their side salad because the house made dressing is addicting! I love it! I usually get avocado Benedict, which never ever disappoints. This morning I tried the cheese board and charcuterie board (if you use Cle Seats the charcuterie board is free with the purchase) and I really enjoyed all the options! I rarely eat meat but my boyfriend indulged while I loved the cheeses and honey. The bloody mary bar looked great but I stuck with a nice simple mimosa. As always the service is wonderful. Water glasses are never empty. My boyfriends coffee remained hot and full. Managers are super friendly when they stop by. Never been disappointed there, the food is all great, farm to table options and worth spending a bit more on a quality brunch you can feel good about! The atmosphere is just wonderful for a morning, we have talked about going there for dinner but we usually end up opting for something with a more romantic feel, and farm decor just isn't romantic for me, but we will definitely make it there one day for dinner!"}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is absolutely on point, yes a Steak House for sure! The staff is over the top attentive. Cocktails are flawless, we entertained our cousin 
Chef Chris Hastings a James Beard Award Winner from The Hot and Hot Fish Club, Birmingham, Alabama... He Loved the entire concept, everything was delicious presentation beautiful the attention to detail perfect."}
{"text":"Overpriced for subpar food. We went for Easter brunch, and although the charcuterie was pretty good, the sausage and roast beef were dry. Basically meh buffet food at a nice looking restaurant. I think you're paying for the atmosphere and some nice meats (charcuterie alone would be worth at least half of your money), but I was disappointed with the quality here.

We sat at the bar, and service was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"1st visit for brunch and I was quite impressed.
Ordered the fruit plate and it was amazing. Although this place is pricey the food is quite good. 
Had Steel Cut Oatmeal and a side of bacon.  The bacon was served in a bowl and for the money it was a really good portion. The oatmeal was just ok. Could use more fruit and milk.

But overall this is a good place for a brunch gathering."}
{"text":"Servers were very friendly and helpful  will say this is not a $$ restaurant. This is $$$ ranger or more. My bill for 6 people that shared 4 steaks and 3 sides was over $300."}
{"text":"I found Urban Farmer to be... Quite the urban farm experience. 

Situated next to the Westin, I was impressed with the decor. Large, spacious, modern type of restaurant.. Oozing just cool.

Having been here once prior (in the lounge, which was quite comfy), I couldn't wait to try this place. It's more on the pricier side.. But what steak place isn't?

We ordered the wagyu tip and the skate wing. The wagyu tip was really really good- cooked to a perfect medium rare, moist and juicy. Whew that's a good piece of meat. I got the skate wing which was cooked in brown butter with an assortment of other items on my plate- broccoli? Radish? Anyways, it was super tender and good. A little small on the portion.. But hey, skate wings aren't that big.

Yes, there are no sides to their entrees (oh well), so we ordered the popcorn grits. Flavorful with a poached egg in it.. Usually I'm not even a fan of grits, but I enjoyed it. 

The favorite of all faves- dessert!!! The dessert portions are large- but we had a trio, nonetheless (just more bang for your buck). The Great Lakes barley custard (with malts and honeycomb) was his favorite, while my faves were the hazelnut affogato and chunky monkey. We got the dark chocolate ice cream as well with the blueberry compote.. But I liked the others better. 

I think Urban Farmer is solid, among the other restaurants downtown- it's definitely more of a steak place though, so if you're looking for a good piece of steak, gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Thursday night. Lots of spacious seating + street parking right across was pretty convenient. I had been looking forward to Urban Farmer's happy hour for so long given the extensive menu online. While the actual menu is still extensive, it is a bit shorter than what you see on the website. For 3 people, we ordered: beer, salted honey beer, some lemon drink, house-made cornbread and rolls (so delectable with the salty butter, this was my favorite), farm fries, bangers and mash, beef slider, bbq pork shoulder, dessert trio (financier - my favorite, moist but hard biscuit-like cake, dolce affogato (interesting, good for coffee lovers, bitter espresso at the bottom), great lakes barley custard - not very sweet, didn't taste the beer)). Food overall was pretty good, but not good enough to justify the price. A slider is maybe 2 bites of food, but costs $5. Can't get very full off of happy hour here as you would visiting some other places. We did miss the bar menu which is hidden in the back of the wine list; saw some girl in the table near us order a decent sized burger with fries for $14, wish we got that instead of some of the small sliders we did!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience overall, which is a shame because we went for a Valentine's Day/anniversary dinner. My steak, the bone in ribeye, came out way underdone and had to be sent back. They gave me a brand new one (and comped me for it), but by the time it had returned the sides were cold and I'd lost most of my interest. 

My wife ordered the trio of New York steaks; only one of them was good, and the other two were bland and tough. She didn't have the heart to complain after I'd already sent my steak back, but for $66 we expected much better. 

The cornbread, Caesar salad, French onion soup, and twice baked potato pastry were all good, but the steaks left a ton to be desired. 

Unless someone else is paying, I'd never come back to Urban Farmer."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at the 3.5 stars this place gets.  We were in town (our first time in Cleveland) for the Saints-Browns game, and decided to check out a nice steakhouse.  Our reservation was for 6:00 Saturday evening, but we arrived a bit early and luckily were seated promptly.  I instantly loved the decor, and we were seated at a nice, intimate booth.  It was great to not be distracted by the conversations of other diners.  

We discussed various appetizers but eventually decided to order a few cheese selections.  The presentation was really nice, and we loved the cheeses.  The accompanying snacks and crackers really complemented the flavors of the cheese.  For our steaks, he ordered a sampler that gives you a chance to try a grass-fed, a grain-fed, and a dry-aged.  I ordered the Nebraska wagyu.  We agreed that my steak was the best of the four, but I guess that's to be expected from a $70 ribeye.  His were really good as well- neither of us had tasted grass-fed before, and while it was good and interesting, I would caution you maybe not to order it alone for your main course if you haven't had it before and aren't sure you would like it.  It's a very distinct taste.  We both loved our choices for entrees.

For sides we got the twice baked potato tart and the creamed corn with pickled peppers.  Again, both sides were delicious.  There are huge, thick chunks of bacon in the tart that really make the dish.  The creamed corn tasted super fresh and was really good.

Overall, we loved the food.  We've dined at some pretty well-regarded restaurants, and I wouldn't say this place was out of line with those.  Service was great, food was great, ambiance was great.  After tip, it set us back $275 for the two entrees, two sides, three cheese selections, and three alcoholic beverages.  When you don't even wince at that kind of check, you know you've had a truly exceptional dining experience.  We would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot - awesome decor and attentive service. Shrimp and grits was amazing as mentioned before. Their special of chocolate glazed donuts with banana jam was heaven - wish that was on the menu more often."}
{"text":"Try the grilled salmon (cooked just right over the best beets u can imagine ), the popcorn grits (with poached egg) and amazing corn bread!  Worth every bite!"}
{"text":"Dinner: the cocktails are amazing especially the whiskey varieties (basically has manhattans and old fashions all night). Apps were ok - personally don't feel like the sweat breads were good (too oily, too salty). The banana soufflé didn't soufflé. I definitely dropped almost $300 for dinner. So there's that.  

But that's the reason I gave it 4 stars. Their Nebraska wagyu (the technique from Kobe region is Japan; you can have wagyu not in Kobe and Kobe beef not wagyu) ribeye is SOOOOO delicious. Perfectly aged, cooked. Juicy and flavorful without being too fatty.  The perfect texture and cut. Just ughhhh. 

Brunch: not as cray expensive as dinner. Solid. The coffee is weak (but so is coffee at most restaurants in Cle). Love the local made butter (or is it made there?). Solid brunch."}
{"text":"All i can say is love love love this restaurant!!!

The steak is awesome, every dish I tried is perfect, and you get what you paid for ...the serving is really big!!!
Ambience is perfect.... Love their Tomahawk steak..."}
{"text":"A colleague and I stopped in for dinner while in Cleveland for a conference. Amazing food and great atmosphere!

We found the service to be very helpful. For example, we both felt we couldn't eat a huge steak by ourselves but we both like steak cooked differently. Our server suggested ordering it the way I liked it (medium rare) and sending half back for additional cooking (to get to well done like my colleague likes it). Brilliant! The steak was wonderful.

We also had the roasted vegetables and baked fingerling potato tart. Mmmmmm....

It's only too bad that Urban Farmer is in Cleveland, because I'd love to go back for dinner with my husband."}
{"text":"Steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly.   The service was great.  The whole table had a very nice time."}
{"text":"Let's start with what works:  the setting is comfortable and warm and has a reclaimed furniture feel to it.  It works nicely. 

I was there for brunch and the food was truly delicious and plentiful.  We are talking eggs, biscuits,  and potatoes here so let's not get too carried away with the chef having to be creative with what my mother made 7 days a week. 

There was a group of 5 and within 3 minutes of our ordering, one of the five entrees came out:  this was clearly intended for another table though the waiter seemed dazed that such a thing could happen.  

After 15 minutes, the waiter came by and we asked where the other four plates were.  He said, \"I will get right on on it\"....which he didn't. He went to 3 other tables to take their orders.  

The food eventually came and it was hot and tasty and we were all satisfied with its quality. 

The manager came by, introduced herself and indicted that if we needed anything to let her know.  I said, \"well, there was a snafu earlier\".  She didn't follow up to ask what it was and walked away.  Why even bother to come by?

The issue with urban farmer is not the food.  You will be happy with it.  The issue is that service is dead in the US and"}
{"text":"Warning this is not a $$ price restaurant for dinner as yelp indicates.  The cheapest entre was $33 and the cheapest steak was $47 & entres do not include a salad or side, so by my math this place should have $$$$.  That being said, there was 4 in our party and the steaks were incredibly tender, juicy with a perfect crust.  The salmon was nothing special.  Would have preferred it not be in a gravy as it caused the fish to not be very flaky. The salads were fresh and tasty but very small, especially for the price so id recommend to pass on those as the sides we had were very good & far more generous than the salads; the carrots glazed in bourbon maple sauce with beets was especially yummy. I'd recommend they make a side dish out of those beets as they were fabulous. 

Our waitress was not at all friendly and was obviously annoyed by our questions.  I asked her what vegetable was with the salmon & she wasn't sure, but guessed an artichoke, but I was pretty certain it was not an artichoke & she didn't bother to ask the chef. We found out after we ordered that there was a specials menu, but we were never given it - not sure if that was the hostess' or waitress' issue, but that's why I dinged them a star.  The other lost star was due to the tiny salads (on big plates though) & just 'ok' salmon.  The restaurant was not filled despite the Saturday night prime dinner hour.  I am not surprised as given their prices, everything needs to be flawless and it's not.  I noticed most of the reviews are for lunch or brunch, but if they want to keep a good dinner crowd IMHO their prices have to come down.  Maybe their specials were more affordable, but of course we never saw those."}
{"text":"Very average meal. Every dish that was served was under seasoned. I found that the plating was confusing and inconsistent. 

Overall, a very underwhelming experience. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is delicious for breakfast! Make reservations because it fills up fast. My husband loves the blood Mary bar. I love the English muffins with breakfast! They are homemade and wonderful!"}
{"text":"After a very thorough description of how special all their house meats were fed, raised and cooked, my $45 medium rare steak came out either too tough, actually raw once you could cut into it with the remaining heavily grizzled. Not very appealing. Actually, horrible. 
We never complain on our dinners out. However, I was hoping to show our waiter the $45 mess, when the busboy took my plate of half eaten steak and said he would talk to our waiter. (Which he did right behind our table.) 
A few minutes later our waiter dropped off the check and told us the sun was out and go enjoy the game. 
On a positive note, the side dishes (salad, fingerlings and grids) were very good. 
But not good enough for a return visit!"}
{"text":"The interior is absolutely beautiful! It's about as elegant and chic as a place with cowhide upholstery could possible be!

I went for a workday lunch with one other person. We didn't have reservations, so we had to wait for a table for about 10 minutes (even though there were many empty tables, but I digress).

I ordered a burger and my friend ordered the shrimp and grits. The $13 burger (ordered medium) was pretty tasty, but inexplicably oozing what appeared to be purple beet juice. It actually didn't bother me at all, but my friend was pretty disgusted by what she described as a puddle of meat blood. 

I would like to check it out for dinner one night, but something tells me that it'll be prohibitively expensive - I think the lunch prices here are higher than any other place I've been downtown, and that includes Lola, Hodges and Chinato."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Seattle and was so excited to try out this restaurant based of the \"great reviews.\" I was staying at the Westin, I ordered a full Caesar salad Togo and brought it up to my room to enjoy as I had to pack up and head to the airport. Not sure how you could mess up on such a simple dish? Not even half of my Togo box was full or even close, there was barley any sauce, and to top it off there was an annoyingly huge piece of lettuce that I had to cut into pieces. My boyfriend ordered the local greens salad and there was only about a teaspoon of quinoa actually in there. The $8 chicken that he added on his salad was plain and no seasoning. Both items were very stingy with portions especially since that's the main dish. Disappointing and definitely not worth $12 & $20. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I posted something a few months back, stating that we had showed up only to find that the restaurant was closed even though that was mentioned nowhere on the website or anywhere else. It should be noted that a senior manager actually sent me a response after that and offered me a gift card, which is pretty decent service all things considered. I didn't take her up on it at the time, mostly I just didn't feel like it was necessary but we did bring a large group of people in yesterday morning for brunch.

The space is much larger than I expected and is pretty interestingly decorated. They even let us make a reservation last minute on a Sunday morning, although from what I can tell they have a lot more space than they need for brunch. Bar service was a little bit on the slow side but the specialty drinks we had were pretty decent. Overall the food was good if not mind blowing, although I will say that the French toast was  excellent. Just for the record, the hash is more beet than anything else, so if that's a brunch staple for you like it is for me, might want to skip it this time.  The service was solid despite some weirdness from a few people in our party, so that was a checked box too. 
If you're into cheese and charcuterie the selections were pretty basic and boring, although they were also on their buffet so maybe that's why.
Gave them  a four for the email response and the service. Not an every week spot for us, but we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"First off this place should not be listed as $$ but $$$$. We had the charcuterie appetizer and the goat cheese was incredible. The house drink was very small and not worth the price. The sampler steaks of 3 choices very over priced.
I have been to many upscale restaurants all over US and usually the service matches the very high prices. Not here very subpar. I had buyers remorse the next day after paying 190.00 for 2 of us. I would advise to try breakfast or lunch here but take a walk out of Westin for dinner.
Gave in 3 stars for appetizer but 2 for rest"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I have been to in Ohio... great food and service. Downtown in the Westin so its convenient for business travelers - especially when its -2 degrees out. Westin was exceptional also with new/reno stylish rooms. Platinum status upgraded me to a suite with great views of downtown."}
{"text":"Overpriced in my opinion. The cornbread is write-home good!!! My steak (filet mignon) was undercooked and served on a lonely plate accompanied by a laughably huge portion of creamed spinach--enough to feed a family of four. So note, the sides must be intended for sharing. The steak itself was just meh. It was overspiced... and the meat itself kinda bland."}
{"text":"This place was okay, seemed pricey and it was late at night so I went with a burger add avocado. I expected sliced avocado but instead it was mashed like guacamole. I wanted to substitute the house salad side with a beet salad, which I offered to pay any difference, but was told this was not allowed. Finally, I ordered the banana cream pie for dessert and it was frozen solid except for the very ends of the bar-shaped \"pie\". The atmosphere is nice, but the fare was average."}
{"text":"Steak is expensive. My mom can usually buy a decent one for $10-$15 and throw it on the iron skillet or grill it and I am happy with it. I do not see much of a difference when going to steakhouses. I had the flat iron cut for $34 and it was a great steak at a high cost. That equates to entrance fee, one appetizer, two Heineken and one lap dance at the Lido Lounge not including tip. It is hard to justify paying that for a piece of meat when all that fun could be had at the same price point on W 117th St. My friend ordered the $96 strip steak sampler including Wagyu beef. He could not finish and was kind enough to break us cheapskates off some meat pieces. They were delicious. The waitstaff is professional and subject matter experts. They know almost too much about the cows. I rather not think about the lives they once lived on farms before ending up in my stupid and mean self. I am not a high-end guy unless I back peddle and end up high. I did enjoy the pampering.

Brunch here is one of my favorite in Cleveland. New Year's Day was funny. People seemed off their game and in pain. Now they can try to empathize with the animals that were slaughtered for them."}
{"text":"Love the modern rustic decor. 
Most times the service was very good.
The food is good but often seemed over complicated something's to the point of rustic fussy...and it's pricey. But most everything on the menu is enough for two.

It's a place where you can easily rack up a very high bill. My friend and I both had appetizers, drinks, then split a salad, side and steak and our bill was $240 before tip.

Also, it gets very crowded and loud when the Cleveland Browns play at home because the stadium is very close to the Westin where this restaurant is located."}
{"text":"While visiting my girlfriends family in Cleveland we decided on Urban Farmer for brunch after 8am Mass. 
 The space is beautiful with nice banquettes and booths throughout the restaurant. We were seated and greeted promptly by our waiter. 
 After perusing the menu I decided on the Sirloin eggs Benedict and added a crispy potato cake on the side. 
 The eggs on the benedict were perfectly poached, the hollandaise nice and flavorful, the sirloin was cut super thin like how roast beef is sliced on a deli slicer. The housemade english muffin was good, however I thought it was too dense. The potato cake was delicious and it soaked up my runny yolk from the poached eggs. 

Overall a good experience  and I will be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place for lunch!  Convenient valet parking and they do a good job and get you in and out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast we have ever had! I ordered the red flannel hash and my husband got the sirloin eggs Benedict. We also got the bloody Mary and Mimosa bar. It is not cheap, for the two of us it was around 80$ with tip. Probably the most I've ever spent on breakfast but worth every penny!!!! Everything is homemade and locally sourced. Trust me you will not regret? going. We will be back."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westin attached to the restaurant and stopped in twice - once for breakfast and another time for a drink at the bar.  Both times we really enjoyed the food and drink.  Lots of different seating choices, especially in the bar/lounge area, which is always nice.  Would have liked to have had the chance to try dinner!"}
{"text":"We just ate lunch here and had the opportunity to try a few things on the menu because it's Restaurant Week.  

Walking in the hostess asked us if we had a reservation...\"Reservation!?\" I thought...it's noon and it's freezing cold outside so I didn't think it'd be too crowded.  Plus, the entire dining room was pretty empty.  Not for long though as around 12:15, every table was seated!  We sat at the bar which has nice and comfy bar stools and was really good for people watching.  I love the rustic but modern feel to the place - there's lots of wood and it's cozy but very straight lines in terms of the design.

We each ordered something different from the menu.  I had the Sweet Potato and Peanut soup, the Roasted Pork Sandwich (bbq sauce, brussels slaw, and mahon cheese on a brioche roll), and the Devil's Food Whoopie pie.  My lunch dates had the Local Greens with fall vegetables, quinoa, honey vinaigrette, the Grilled Chicken Sandwich (bacon, gruyere, stone fruit jam, and chili aioli on poppyseed brioche), and Hazelnut Ice Cream.  There wasn't a lick of anything left on any of our plates.  The brussels slaw on the pulled pork was such an awesome addition to the sandwich and both of my dates really enjoyed the seasoning on the chicken.  I can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is unique compared to other local steak houses as it serves meat from cows that have been been grass fed, corn fed then grain finished or completely corn fed. The steaks are not my favorite. I find even the corn fed steaks to be a bit tougher and drier than what other local steakhouses serve. To see for yourself though you can get a steak sampler and try side-by-side the various types of steaks. 

Steaks aside I do like the seasonal rotation of ingredients that find their way into the salads and sides. This keeps the sides interesting and updated frequently. I enjoyed the squash gratin. The dish contained thin sliced squash, just a little bit of cheese and a good serving of sausage mixed in.   

The appetizer list is a bit limited when it comes to sharing a dish. My best recommendation would be the tartare. The tartare is served with a deviled egg and mixed with fennel and parmesan and is excellent. I'd say it is one of the things Urban Farmer is known for. 

If you are not a raw beef fan, the charcuterie or the cheese boards are good options. Some evenings there is a cheesemonger on duty that wheels around a cart with the night's selection of cheeses providing samples and information on the offerings whether or not you purchase a cheese board. 

For dessert I enjoyed the butterscotch sundae. Served in a jar, this dessert had a nice crunchy bottom layer (a blondie) and is topped with ice cream.

Compared to other steakhouses I prefer Urban Farmer for it's appetizer and desserts. Since that isn't the main attraction at a steakhouse I was slightly disappointed. But not to worry, there are fish options on the menu as well. The cocktail menu is good as well. While a bit gin heavy, there are good options that the bartenders themselves have created."}
{"text":"Wonderful concept and great unique meals! I had the chopped hash with beets and poached eggs, I ordered it with a side of hollandaise sauce and it was AMAZING! Nothing short of greatness here, and reasonable prices to top it off"}
{"text":"Excellent little slice of farm to table heaven in the middle of Cleveland.  Some of the best biscuits ever.  We enjoyed the farmer's breakfast and burger.  All very good.  Homemade sausage were also excellent.  Probably the best breakfast in town.  They also have a bloody mary bar.  Fresh juices as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in just a few weeks after they opened for a drink.  The inside space is gorgeous and the bar area is sleek and trendy.  Our bartender was knowledgeable and friendly and my plain Ketal and soda tasted perfect.  While we didn't stay for food, I made immediate reservations to come back again and try their awesome-looking menu!"}
{"text":"Love Urban Farmer! Just stopped in for a quick drink after work and ended up staying for a bite to eat!  Caitlin, a manager there stopped by and talked me into it! Will return and hope to see her when I do!"}
{"text":"Finally made a return visit to the Urban Farmer and really happy we did. Once again the steaks were outstanding and the service was super too. Our group had the porterhouse, the grass fed sirloin and the 16 ounce Wagu and I tried all of the. The porterhouse had a little more marbling than I care for, but the flavor was outstanding. The other steaks were perfectly prepared and tasted great.  I ordered the special spaghetti with littleneck clams. It was spicy and flavorful with just the right amount of heat. The clams were cooked just right. We enjoyed the green salad with quinoa what a pleasant surprise.  The sides cauliflower, mushrooms and grits were delicious. This was truly a very enjoyable evening. I am glad that the management  reached out to make sure we were satisfied. I recommend this to restaraunt to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past for lunch and the food has been great both times. This time a tried brunch and would have to say it's one of the best I've ever had in Cleveland. We were with a group of 10 and our server was awesome. She was very friendly and did a great job. I got the eggs Benedict and it was delish. The menu is a little on the higher end but it is reflected in the portion sizes and quality of the food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant while in Cleveland. High quality food and service. Been here for lunch and dinner, and either way it has been nothing less than satisfying."}
{"text":"Well, i would have loved to tell everyone about the beautiful food and drink at Urban Farmer, except I never got any because our server never appeared.  Actually, that's not fair, he did appear, about six times, near our table and even made eye contact but never decided to stop by. 

I'm trying to decide if going back there is worth the price. One would think that to operate a restaurant that boasts such an impressive menu one would also have an equally impressive service staff."}
{"text":"Revisited this establishment and had a much better dining experience.  Food here is as good as it gets anywhere in Cleveland.  I still think they make the best steak in town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Glad I didn't travel to the airport first. Although portion was unecessarily huge (French toast). If I finished it I'd need to go back upstairs in the Westin for a nap!"}
{"text":"Good steak and great service. Ordered the 24 oz ribeye, rare which was perfectly cooked. Only complaint I had was that the steak was a bit over salted for my taste. Also had the French onion soup and the mushrooms, which were also excellent. 

Most importantly - we came right at opening since we were just in town for a night and had our 1 year old with us. The serving staff was very pleasant and helpful, despite the fact that little guy loves to be a mess! Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to post a review and unfortunately this was a particularly bad experience. Brief run down:
- surly service across the board.
- the description of the shrimp and grits with pork and a poached egg sounded amazing. It was flavorless so I added hot sauce. 
- a fruit fly came crawling out from under my wife's sandwich after she'd eaten half of it.
- the saving grace was the meal was free."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would give less then 5 stars. First, Ill start off by saying this restaurant is in the lobby of a hotel. Might be a little off putting for some. However we always look for local, farm to table places to eat. So where to begin....

Of course- a bottle of red to go with what we already decided was going to be red meat. Excellent choices! 

First plate- we ordered the cheese and charcuterie plate. The cheesemonger who explained all the cheeses to us was great. He tried to match our taste to what we liked before, and what we were having for dinner. Amazing. 

Bites before the main course. They make corn bread in a tin cup! Yes like a soup can. JUST PERFECT. I would have never thought of that but it was one of the best I've ever had. 

Steak- We had the trio of steaks to share. All very good! No complaints. We ordered our red meat medium rare every time. The steaks all had their own flavors, textures and tenderness. 

I can't say enough. If you are a steak eater, in Cleveland- this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Urban Farmer is amazing! They have amazing Sunday brunch! The avocado Benedict is so delicious and very filling. They have amazing tea and everything is so fresh! They also have a great Bloody Mary bar! I highly recommend this restaurant.  Unfortunately I can't remember her name, but I've had the same server a few times and she is beyond friendly and so knowledgeable! 

I've also been there for dinner and wow! First things first, they have amazing warm cornbread. I was with a large group and everything we ordered was great! I have zero complaints! I love the food, environment and staff! 

Definitely one of the best places to go in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"OH my gosh. The Honey Biscuit Brunch Special. Can we say divine? 
I love this place. Drinks are wonderful, food is pure quality and so flavorful. So many different levels of flavor. AND the cavs players go here to eat! Apparently some of them had just left when I walked in! SO bummed but so cool!"}
{"text":"In town for a few days for work.  Walked next door to try this place for a quick dinner.  On the plus side, great drink selection, cool environment.  Ordered the burger for dinner, pretty underwhelming... It was dry and lacking in flavor. Wouldn't order again.

Would return, but probably for drinks only."}
{"text":"Figured we'd give their brunch a try and oh, boy, are we glad we did!

We had some friends in from out of town who were conveniently staying at the Westin.  Coming downstairs there was no wait, and we had a friendly waitress.  We got the cheddar biscuits, the steak benedict and the shrimp and grits.  Everything was stacked with meat and deliciousness!  You could tell that each dish was thoughfully put togehter.  For example, the shrimp and grits had a wonderful savoryness to it, plump shrimp, a plop of well seasoned pork and tiny little crutons which gave the dish a nice complexity of textures.  

I also got a bloody mary which I had the bartender make.  Well, that was a mistake because I soon walked by the bloody mary bar and was shocked by the delicious pickled EVERYTHING that was there.  Thankfully, I could visit with my bartender made bloody to restock on all those lovely little garnishes.  

I'll absolutely be back.  Maybe next time for dinner!"}
{"text":"I live in NE Ohio and was downtown Cleveland for a conference at the new Convention Center. Great location for a visit to Urban Farmer.  A colleague and I visited for lunch and had a perfect lunch. On-brand decor, excellent service and outstanding fresh/local food made the day. The chicken sandwich is exceptional - and that's hard to say about a chicken sandwich. The bacon and the fresh ingredients take it over the top. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I was here for business lunches they didn't quite seem to have themselves together but now that Urban Farmer has been open for a few months it seems the kinks have been worked out!  Food is always great but I'd like to highlight their awesome happy hour.  It's rare to find happy hours with the right combo of food AND drink specials and this one is great. Lots of delicious small plates (chicken pops, beef tenderloin and sliders  stand out) plus good prices for beer, wine, and a few special cocktails. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Average at best. The steaks were decent but the price was prohibitive. For the same price you can have outstanding steaks at iconic steak houses with better steaks."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin and decided to have brunch Saturday morning at UF.  It was so amazing we want to make the drive to Cleveland (an hour for us) just to have dinner here.  My husband had the steak and eggs.  His steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The waitress brought him a tray with whipped butter, homemade jam and homemade applesauce for his toast.  I had the turkey club which was huge, could only eat half and it was tasty. Apparently they have barrel-aged cocktails, which we did not try, but it's on the to do list.  We were curious about the vegetable garden we saw on the roof from our room.  Our waitress told us it was for the restaurant.  They also have their own herb garden.  Everything from decor, service, and food quality was as good as it gets.   Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food poor service.

Walked in with a friend and took two seats at the bar.  Was quickly greeted by one of two bartenders behind a not so busy bar.  Was quickly asked what we would like to drink.  Mentioned would like a whiskey and a beer.  Was handed drink menus and picked out a whiskey.  After drink just being set in front of us we had to ask for dinner menus.  Bartender set them down and walked away. Never got to order our beer.  Quickly picked out the steak I wanted to order.  And then bartender never asked what we wanted to order. Both myself and friend felt ignored. A solid 20 minutes went by. Finally we decided it may be better to go see the hostess and get a table to get away from the bartender that seemed to have no interest in us running up a tab of appetizers, beers, whiskey, steaks and sides.   Hostess promptly got us a table on the patio.  Waiter brought us out waters and ordered us another round of drinks.  Waiter seemed overwhelmed with too many tables.  But after about another 10-15 minutes finally asked us what we would like to order.  Our charcuterie board came out and was wonderful.  Water glasses empty, beer empty our plates were cleaned but no more water brought out until we asked.  Food runner brought us steaks and just set them down. Never asked if we maybe needed knives to cut them.  So about another 5 minutes went down before we flagged down another staff to bring us knives and fill our water.  Steaks were amazing and prepared perfectly.  The steaks made up for the service and I could give a 5 star for food and a 2 star for service I would.   Waiter was trying to keep up and as things slowed down on this not real busy Wednesday night the waiter came over to say how understaffed they were.  He realized that the service was poor but he seemed to be the only one that cared.  Luckily my friend and I were really chill about it because it was a relaxing evening out.  Without us complaining about service the waiter did offer us complementary desserts.  My second time to Urban Farmer and the food has been great both times.  Hopefully the front of the house can get their act together and I can give a better review next time."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around noon. I ordered the waygu burger special ($15). It was juicy and fresh. I chose the greens as a side and it was also fresh and crisp. The atmosphere was modern yet 'farm'. They share a restroom with the adjacent hotel and it's a great bathroom. Can't complain and would go back to try other options."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a large group of friends from all over the country (San Francisco, New York, DC) and each of us left very impressed with Urban Farmer. First, the restuarant was very nicely decorated. Second, the service was excellent, as the servers were very attentive and provided excellent recommendations. The food was very fresh and well portioned. You definitely get a lot for what you pay for here and it was well worth it. I'll certainly stop by again during my next visit to the city."}
{"text":"After staying overnight at the Westin on my birthday, it was so convenient and great to be able to roll out of bed and have almost immediate access to flavored vodka options, a Bloody Mary bar with all the fixins, and good quality food. At 2PM, no less! (Brunch lasts until 3.) The first thing we did was choose bacon and pickle vodka, respectively -- each very different, but both delicious -- and loaded up our mason jars. While sippin' on our Bloodys, we decided to order a few sides since we had vouchers (thanks Destination Cleveland!). We went with the Chicken Cherry Sausage (I'm not a HUGE meat person, so the bf enjoyed this one more than me) and the Crispy Breakfast Potato, which was basically one massive hash brown. Zero complaints from us. But the best part of the meal was definitely our main courses .... ORDER THE EGGS BENEDICT, PPL. Srsly. Even if you've never had it before (like me), you will NOT regret it. Our server was excellent and recommended adding ham to the Avocado Benedict, so we did, and we also got the Sirloin Benedict. Like any awesome couple, we swapped and got the best of both. They were served atop huge, house-made English muffins with really great-tasting red pepper sauce on the side that, when used, gave everything a flavorful zing. (Use it sparingly! You only get so much.) While the egg and hollandaise sauce was delicious, I was honestly terrified to pop the whole thing in my mouth (again, first-timer) despite the bf saying it was probably the best thing he's ever tasted. But after about five minutes (much to his frustration) I took the plunge, and it pretty much tasted like heaven in my mouth. I can definitely say that this was one of the best brunch items I've ever ordered in the CLE. Don't let the brand/image of Urban Farmer intimidate you. If you're worried about price, wait for a special occasion or order sparingly and split the check. You won't regret it!"}
