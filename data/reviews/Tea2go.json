{"text":"Really good spicy chai latte. Worker was kind and friendly...Whoever was working Wednesday afternoon, you were really nice..thanks! If I lived closer I would be there every morning.

The smell when you walk in is really nice and everything is clean. Bathroom is well-designed, too!"}
{"text":"Our office is not only a big fan of their teas, but we have also enjoyed utilizing their gift cards as a thank you for colleagues.  Their loose leaf teas are delicious, good quality, and varied!  What a nice change from Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to visit!  My daughter recommended it to me, and right away realized it's unique offerings. My first visit was a delicious nutty-flavored coffee, second and third stops were the Coconut Creme Iced tea from the tea bar--OMG AMAZING!   Very friendly barista, too."}
{"text":"Delicious tea, better than most teas that I've ever had. Great smoothies and milk teas with boba as well. Same is to be said about the staff. Truly more friendly and helpful than most stores I've ever been to, bar none. The environment is very trendy and inviting. Highly recommend over something more chain like such as the usual Starbucks or Dutch bros."}
{"text":"We went in for coffee before heading off to apartment shop. We are new to the area and the owner took the time to educate us about the different areas we would want to look at and how the commute to work would be from the different locations. On top of owner being very personable the coffee was great!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and delicious drinks! We got the sweet chai with almond milk and the spiced cookie latte with almond milk, both iced. The sweet chai was AMAZING, as was the spiced cookie latte, although I think it would've been better hot (I know for next time). Great atmosphere and I can't wait to buy some of the loose tea."}
{"text":"If you like iced tea, this is the place to go! They have a really big selection, freshly brewed, that is help yourself. Very cool place!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the staff makes it all the more worthwhile to visit! With so many options I need to venture outside my comfort zone of pomegranate mojito green tea; I just love it though!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! So many teas! There is a tea bar and hundreds of loose leaf options too. Black, white, green, whatever you're in the mood for! Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This tea shop is located in the high street where parking can be a hassle. I called and came on several occasions to see if they had boba tea but they're always out. When they offered me jelly, I thought they were going to have grass jelly like boba shops but they pulled out something super colorful. I had settled with the Thai tea which was way too sweet."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly! If you come here enough they'll even remember your name and order! I love the yoga tea, but almost everything I've had has been great. There's a huge selection of teas, but they have coffee and smoothies as well. Prices are better than Starbucks and the lines are shorter too!"}
{"text":"One of the best tea places I've been to. Love the multitude of loose leaf options and other drink options. The staff is very helpful and the teas on the wall are labeled by category so you can find teas that relax, energize, boost health, etc. Great atmosphere too! Very open, clean with a fun industrial/rustic appeal."}
{"text":"Love this little place! The flavored organic berry sugars(which they will add to any tea) are located behind the counter. 
There are about two dozen times of ice teas steeped daily, 20 custom Evo oils and lots of loose leaf teas. 
 
Discount if you bring back your empty ice tea cup.

Good place to enjoy a quiet afternoon tea with friends."}
{"text":"I popped into Tea2Go to grab a quick, cold beverage after running around in the AZ heat all day. Their concept is amazing and you can choose an organic loose leaf tea selection from their wall full of SO many flavors. {See Pic! & they will even let you smell them before choosing!} The prices were definitely reasonable and the portions were very large! It was literally the perfect refreshment during a hot summer day. Dear HQ, Please open a store closer to Old Town Scottsdale/Camelback Corridor area!! :) I would absolutely be a regular! They also have already brewed selections for a little bit cheaper if you wanted to quickly fill up a cup that way! If you're on High Street, stopping into Tea2Go for a cold or hot beverage is a must!"}
{"text":"I'm a little ashamed it took me so long to get to this great little Tea place which is a stone's throw from my office.  You can't walk around our office of 300 plus employees and not see multiple cups of tea from Tea2Go.  And since I'm a huge lover of tea, you'd think I'd be the Duke of this place-I will be shortly.

This is a super place to get in all likelihood, the finest tea in Phoenix.  They have approximately 16 blends, some sweetened, some not, on tap.  Grab a large cup and go to town!  Even better, wash the cup out and bring it back for a discounted refill.  I understand you can also pick out some loose tea and have them brew it for you, sounds like a plan!

This is also the place to grab some amazing flavored Olive Oils and Balsamic Vinegars. If you think 16 variety of teas is impressive, check out the oils and vinegars, all kinds for all types of tastes.  The hottest oil is Harissa, can't wait to try it!

If a cup of Joe is more your liking, they have you covered there as well-no need for Starbucks on High Street."}
{"text":"Products and Service good based on previous visits, but location Manager/Owner need to get store hours properly listed. Store website shows 9 am, store door says 10 am, Yelp shows 11 am.... Which is it? Showed up a little after 9 am today"}
{"text":"Tea Please! That's what I say when I drop in at Tea2go. Fresh herbal teas hot and cold. Varies flavors based on your tastebuds and needs. A dynamic concept of organic teas that taste amazing. I am not a fan of bag tea's so dropping in to grab a tea 2 go makes my day. I do have to wait since it is freshly brewed however the tasty tempting olive oils make it worth the wait. I am planning a day to come in and really spend some time. There are so many wonderful olive oil flavors to choose from including ones that I have never heard of before. 

Now the real tempting part is the tasty treats. Unlike Starbucks they are made in house. Today they had peppermint brownies which are my ultimate favorite but since I am trying to be good I settled with the gingersnap cookies. I bought three of them and they did not make it back to the office. Can't wait to try the other bake goods they offer.

Let me mention they have a Tea Bar. That's right fresh brewed flavored tea with an ice machine next to it. Need to flavor it up they have sweeter to help give it a little sweetness if needed.  

Sitting area to enjoy your drink or have a small one on one meeting. Staff is friendly, informative and helpful. Be sure to stop in and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The most amazing iced tea bar. What a perfect concept for AZ. I love this place. I go every week."}
{"text":"Tea2go I am obsessed enough said I always look forward to getting my tea here.  Best in town!!"}
{"text":"This has become an almost daily habit! Fresh tea and a great variety, don't care for coffee so this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Amazing tea! I went here with my mom today for some tea and wow we were so pleased. It was not busy at all and actually really spacious which was surprising to me! Would be a good place to come and study, not too loud or crowded.
The tea selection is huge which is awesome, I had a hard time choosing. There's a big wall of the loose leaf teas and you can smell them. They have so many I was surprised to see it! Also being able to smell definitely helped my decision. I went for green pomegranate mojito tea and it was sooo good. I got it iced, took a long time to prepare kind of, but it's nice that they have some already prepared read in the back! My mom got a coconut chai and it was really great! Also the \"small\" size is huge and reasonably priced. Love it here and can't wait to try more. I certainly have a new favorite tea joint!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Starting off customer service is spot on. Brea has helped me several times and has always been super knowledgeable and friendly. The best part about Tea2Gois you can smell the Tea prior to ordering them. If you don't have the time to have a tea brewed they have a wall of ready to go Ice Teas. I also like that they have a good rewards program and give you discounts for bringing back your cups. You have the options of ginger lime, lemon and coconut sugar. 
My personal recommendations on tea would be the pomegranate blue or the Yoga tea unsweetened if you want to add sugar to it I would recommend the ginger sugar. Yum!"}
{"text":"Closed up shop as of yesterday.

Shelves were being emptied today"}
{"text":"Finally made it in. Need to spend some dedicated time there but like what I see so far. Service was very friendly and helpful. Took a great iced tea to go - lots of great choices available that day. Glad it's close by!"}
{"text":"The woman working on 7/19 was so sweet and helpful. Plenty of tea to pick from. Definitely going to come here more often!"}
{"text":"Love the tea bar but the service is awful. Employees never know how to answer my questions and the times on Yelp are always wrong! This is the 3rd time I came and they were closed."}
{"text":"Update -- Went in a month ago and they were closed down. Very unfortunate. 

This place is great, you can choose from their iced team bar with several black and green tea selections or have them freshly brew whatever tea or coffee you want. They also have an olive oil bar. Love this place! Located on High Street right off the 101 we 56th street."}
{"text":"Really nice addition to high street. No better way to start off an afternoon of driving around in the Arizona heat then a 44oz ice tea. 

The staff is really nice and helpful. Very knowledgeable about tea. Jordanna had me try chocolate mocha / Carmel Java which was a complete surprise. My taste buds couldn't decide if I was drinking coffee or tea. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting and I'm really glad I found this place! It's been very difficult to find a decent tea shop in Phoenix, most of the tea shops I've been to can't even prepare tea properly. I was definitely impressed with Tea2go. They have a good selection of loose leaf teas and while I'm not the biggest fan of flavored teas they still had plenty of options for just straight tea. They can also prepare the teas latte style which I love. I wouldn't say these are the most high quality teas for a true tea connoisseur but if you are looking for a decent cup of tea this is the place. They also have excellent customer service, Jordana (I believe that was her name) was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had never been to the shop, and we're not quite sure how it worked when we walked in. The young gal at the counter was assisting a customer with a very large loose tea purchase of six bags at a cost of $80. She never even looked up and greeted us as we waited.  we finally interrupted and asked how does it work here?  she said oh you just pick out what you want and I'll start it for you. Never once did she say there is freshly brewed tea by the glass, self service around the corner. We only found this when we took seats nearby.

I had chosen a tea that was not available in the self service area, but had I known about this area prior to my order I might have chosen an option that was self service for about half the price and zero wait. After tasting several of the self service teas, I was still satisfied with my choice.  It was a roibos red tea with the name coffee cake. It tasted a little like coffee and caramel. 

I really enjoyed the tea, and I love the inside of the restaurant. The decor is comfortable and upscale modern, with a huge display of olive oils available for tasting as well. I think they have a ways to go on customer interaction skills, especially when it was clear that we did not know how the ordering process worked and that we weren't even advised of the self-service bar. If this is their whole concept, and we were clearly newbies, why didn't she advise us?

In summary, I do like the concept, and the Self Service pricing is excellent. If you are ordering coffee or brewed tea expect $4 to $5 each. It seems like quite a splurge for me, seeing as how I have a pantry full of herbal teas. But for a nice atmosphere and comfortable seating to visit with a girlfriend, it is a nifty place."}
{"text":"It's great but they need to update their hours on here. They close at 6 on week days I believe and 5 on weekends. I'd still recommend this place"}
{"text":"Clean and fresh look/atmosphere.  Don't love the current hours.  Not even a huge tea fan, but I could see this place really swinging me away from my standard ice coffee.  Reasonable prices, with great loyalty program and refill policy.  Owner/staff very friendly/knowledgable about products."}
