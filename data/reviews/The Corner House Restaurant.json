{"text":"Charming, romantic setting, quiet conversation, delicious food, and happy staff - what is not to love. The mushroom soup is a must try, as is the fish. Truly wonderful, with a tasting menu available for early diners."}
{"text":"I cannot say a bad thing about the food. It was wonderful. But the service was so bad! Not just bad, our waiter was down right rude!

It was impossible to not over-hear him talking to a table of regulars how all these 'winterlicious' people come out for a cheap meal and never come back. We had our wine before we ever got water. They kept promising to bring a candle to our wobbly table but never did. The 'hostess' kept coming to chat with a table of regular, and so her butt was always inches from us, and one time she brought her bus boys up, who almost knocked our wine over twice as they stood and chatted. At the end of the meal I ordered tea, and something was wrong with the water, it just didn't taste right. I asked the waiter to take it away, explaining it didn't taste right. Barely an apology, and didn't ask if I wanted anything else. So we sat, and sat, and sat and he never came back. When he finally did he walked up and said 'so what do you want me to do?' My friends and I were shocked! Where did that come from? We just asked for the bill. 

We might have been there because of Winterlicious, but I have gone back to places I enjoyed. But I have never been treated so rudely."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with friends for a Winterlicious gathering one year. I loved it so much that my boyfriend decided to take me for our Valentine's meal this past year. We were anticipating a separate menu (and not their Winterlicious menu - since usually for most restaurants if Vday falls within Winterlicious then it is null for that day). However, we found out they were still serving their 3 course set menu.

It turned out to be a lovely and affordable valentine's meal. This place feels so homey and the food tastes amazing. The meat is always succulent and cooked to perfection. I'm not a rare meat type of girl so when my meat is cooked medium-well AND is still juicy it is nothing short of amazing.

The only down side is how cramped it is (aka. the entrance pathway, narrow hallways, etc). They also try to shoo you out as soon as possible - you can feel the pressure when you're with a fairly large group.

Regardless, loved the food here."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 4 for Winterlicious. I have been here outside of the Winter/Summerlicious periods, so I will compare them in a little bit.

Corner House is divided among the 2 floors of a house - upstairs is a larger dining area and the rooms below contain the bar, kitchen and 2 smaller dining rooms with a few tables in each. The lower floor is a lot more intimate if you are with a significant other or small group.

There is free parking on the street after hours along Madison and Huron Street. A little warning, if you have to wait you'll be crowding the small little doorway and waiters will be madly dashing between rooms.

Understand that during Winterlicious food may be prepared with a little less love but it's still worth the price point ($35/person). But if you do choose to come to Corner House outside of their peak periods, you will be treated really well and the food is top notch. I don't recommend the Sirloin steak - try the venison if you're a little more adventurous.

Towards the end of our meal the waiters did start to get a little pushy and even took the saucer away from my coffee before I put the cup back down. They do have a lot of customers to serve due to the popularity of the restaurant. Anyways, nothing terrible to say, but not to much to compliment either.

To add, if you miss Winterlicious they often have a habit of extending it well into February."}
{"text":"Just went here with a few friends for a birthday.  The service and food was great (especially the black cod with rice) but the charm of the house is the best part.  It's like going to a friend's warm house for dinner. 

Strongly recommended,"}
{"text":"Went in 2010 for Summerlicious.  It was a lovely experience and would recommend it.  I didn't really care for the table I was seated at as it was awkwardly positioned and in general the seating all seemed a little too cramped.  The closeness to other tables makes it hard to turn out other people's conversations."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and I've never been so wowed by halibut before.  A really nice intimate night out for our anniversary, perfect."}
{"text":"For a supposedly a good restaurant,  this place has absolutely no idea what service is.

Waited 45 minutes to get seated. But we were late for our reservation so we thought that was ok, since it was kind of our fault. Then we realized that everyone was waiting that long because they are extremely overbooked. Didn't actually matter what time your reservation was for, it was first-come-first-served. And to get a table you had to stand on top of the hostess and constantly remind her that you were waiting. Otherwise you would never get a table, like we saw some people who chose to go for a walk or wait on the benches down the street.

Once seated, we kept waiting for service. After about 15 minutes a waiter came around and took and order from the table next to us, who were seated at the same time as us. He didn't say hi to us, or acknowledged our presence in any way. He poured water for the other table, so we figured he ran out of water, and he was coming back to take our order once he put theirs in. After another 10 minutes of waiting, he came back to verify the order he just took from the other table, turned around and walked away without saying as much as hi to us.

We got up, told him that we were leaving because we got no service after 25 minutes. He didn't even apologize. He just said: \"Oh, i didn't see you there\". How could you not after taking an order from the table next to us? And as a waiter, how can you not know your tables and who has been served or not? And how is it possible that no other waiter covered for him?

After all that we were so happy to walk out and not leave any money at this place at all. We went to one of our favourite places down the road and had a better meal and one of the best service in Toronto for less money than this place.

Corner House has absolutely the worst service we've ever experienced anywhere in the world, including Malta, where you have to wait forever to get service and food. But at least there they are constantly coming up to you and apologizing for the wait."}
{"text":"This was I think my best winterlicious experience to date! Unlike other winterlicious menus they provide a choice of 7 appetizers and 7 mains. 

Service: Because there were so many great choices my table took a long time to decide. The waiter was very patient with us and answered all our many questions. Food came out quickly. 

Food: Everyone was very happy with all their dishes. I personally shared the mushroom soup and the shrimp for an appetizer with a friend, had the black cod for my main and the apple crumble for dessert. Portions were generous (which is not always the case at winterlicious) and everything was delicious. The only thing I would've liked was more ice cream on my crumble and that is likely a personal preference. The most stand out of the dishes was definitely the black cod which was perfectly cooked.
 
Space: The space is really cute as its in a house. You feel like you are dining in someone's personal dining room and it has a nice intimate feel as it is split into smaller rooms that each hold only about 15-20 people. 

Wine: This is my only complaint. There were only about 7 wines offered by the glass (although the menu recommended pairings which was nice) and the cheapest was $10. Although I was very happy with my wine I like when a restaurant provides a cheaper option for a house red or white. 

Actually one other warning: we were a group of 5 and they said they normally will not split the bill 5 ways which is very annoying since these days no one carries cash. Luckily since they weren't that busy due to a snowstorm and it was late they made an exception."}
{"text":"I went with a big group of friends for winterlicious.

The food was amazing! I had been reading good reviews on this place so i could say that if you have never tried, you HAVE to eat there at least once!

This was a nice cozy restaurant literally inside of a house. Interesting experience."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for a long time, and finally get to try it!  I read some reviews before I going there, so for my main course, I picked the Cornish hen! My boyfriend picked the strip loin. I really liked the cornish hen, it's so crispy and moist.  My second option was the black cod, I really wished that we could get three plates! 
For appetizer, we chose something more unique, the caramelized onion tart and the seared pear with goat cheese, bacon + wild mushroom soup. Both of them were amazingly good, it's totally worth taking the risk of not choosing the butternut squash soup and tiger shrimp. For dessert, we got a sticky toffee pudding and the flourless chocolate torte. The toffee pudding was highly recommended by our waitress, and he's right! It's not really a pudding, it's more like an upside down cake, soaked with toffee/caramel! I like it more than the flourless chocolate torte. 

After coming here, I fell in love with this neighbourhood. It's very unique, cozy, it's totally a hidden gem!  Especially, they got free parking on the street after 6pm!"}
{"text":"The Corner House was referred to us by a local tour guide at Casa Loma (local castle tour). The atmosphere is very quaint. The service was phenomenal. The way your treated as you walk into the door till the time you pay your check is wonderful. The waiter was very friendly. We chose the pre-fix menu for dinner.
      My wife had a delicious arugula salad and I had a tasty crab cake  for our appetizer. For dinner my wife had a very good strip loin entree. I had a mouth watering bacon wrapped pork tenderloin that was to die for.  The chef came out with our desserts. My wife had the sticky pudding that made you want to scrape the plate clean. I had a delicious chocolate tart that was devouring!
       Being 10 hours away from home, I would recommend this to anyone I know traveling into Canada. The chef was very friendly and shows he cares how his product is presented and tastes. The only thing I would suggest is more wait staff when busy!   

Overall, this place is a must to those in town!!!"}
{"text":"We went here to try the Summerlicious menu.

Cute neighbourhood, quaint restaurant, and pretty good food.

There were three of us. I ordered the leek and potato salad, sirloin and I asked for sorbet for the dessert. Service was a problem. Nothing huge but little things. They brought out the soup and then disappeared without giving me a spoon. So while the other two were eating I was trying to flag someone down until I finally caught someone's attention. The soup itself was good, nothing amazing. The sirloin was well cooked and tender. It came with veggies and potatoes. The sides were standard, nothing too exciting. My desert was sorbet which was also good and typical sorbet.  

My other friend ordered black tiger shrimp, which she said was really good, the ravioli, which was also really good and bread pudding, which she said was very rich. They initially messed up our desserts and brought out 3 bread puddings and then went back. I found the waitress really weird, she never took ownership of being our waitress. Like with the whole dessert thing, she said - they will be fixing it for you. We all said - shouldn't you be fixing it for us? And shouldnt she be responsible for bringing out the spoon? Another thing that was weird about her is we asked for more bread for dinner and she made a dig at us. It was rude - she said 'bring on the carbs ladies' And NO - none of us are overweight which would have been way worse.

My last friend ordered, prosciutto, halibut and the chocolate dessert. She liked the app, liked the main but did not like the dessert.

Other service blunders - this guy came around and started pouring tap water into the my friends glass that had sparkling in it even though the bottle of sparkling was sitting right in the middle of our table.

I would give the food a 4/5 for being good but nothing to rave about and the service 2.5/5 for all the little things that should have been avoided and are avoided at 99% of other restaurants."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I usually hate expensive upscale restaurants. I usually find that for how much extra you have to pay compared to cheaper restaurants , the food quality doesn't necessarily improve much, if at all. But my parents were in town, and wanted to go somewhere \"nice\" (I guess that means expensive), and we ended up at the Corner House.

I enjoyed the Corner House. 

The restaurant has mutliple rooms, and the room we were seated in only had 4 - 5 tables, so it was nice and quiet. 

I ordered the House Caesar Salad and The Striploin Steak.  My Steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious.

If you want a more upscale restaurant this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews about this place, I must say I was slightly disappointed.  All the food we ordered tasted good and was well prepared, but it was nothing spectacular, and for the price, I expected spectacular.  The restaurant felt like it was one of those places that had been doing the same thing for years, with no changes.  Even the house itself had a stuffy feel.  The items on the menu did not demonstrate any creativity -it was just the usual chicken, steak, lamb, seafood and pasta.  The wine list was mediocre.  The server was very attentive, but he did not have the finesse that I would expect from a fine dining establishment.  Overall, the food is good, but the restaurant needs an update on its menu to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I'd eat here everyday for every meal if I could. The food here is absolutely delicious! This is probably my favourite restaurant in Toronto. It's nice and cozy and the prices are a little higher than other restaurants but the food is worth it. Depending on what you order portions maybe medium to small.
They have a nice alcohol selection that isn't to overwhelming. Their winter luscious menu is good but their regular menu has all the great stuff. 
My only complaint is that it can get a little tight when it's really busy.
If you haven't tried it then make your way there tonight... With a date or a loved one."}
{"text":"The Corner House is a fab restaurant with terrific service.

We popped in for Winterlicious and were treated with a wonderful meal and the most courteous and service-minded staff!  Although there were several people waiting for tables, the host was cheerful and efficient. 

The best kept secret in Toronto?  The Corner House has a $35 prix fixe menu for early seating times until March!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a special night out, I highly recommend The Corner House.  It has a great country house atmosphere and is romantic and intimate.  It's so nice to be able to hear the person you're with as well as eat a delicious meal.

The night I went, I was celebrating my anniversary with TM, so we went all out.  We ordered crab cakes, lobster bisque, duck and lamb entrees and a fantastic cheese plate and macarons for dessert.  Everything was delicious and the presentation was too notch.  I've posted pictures if you're interested, but be warned that you will be susceptible to severe mouth watering. 

What I liked best was the attention to detail. The staff were attentive, and when I mentioned on my Open Table reservation that we were celebrating, they were sure to add a special touch to our dessert plate.  Can't wait until I go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the city.

I highly recommend ordering the seafood appetizer. By far the best scallops I have had in the city.

Been here several times, and have never had a disappointing appetizer or entree. Service is always very pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a based in a 'regular' neighborhood house... so you get in and choose which 'room' would you live to sit at... the house's kitchen is actually the kitchen and this is where you will find the chef and the owner most of the time. i suspect that because of the small kitchen, they serve your food pretty slowly... so if you are really hungry... and want food 'now'...  dont go there.

i actually feel it is an advantage, as I usually go there with my wife and we enjoy a slow and confortable dinner when no one rush you to pay the bill and leave...

i love their food, and most of the waiters are nice (some stiff though)

i would recommed it for a romantic dinner, but i must admit that last time i was there i saw a large group in one of the rooms and it seems like they had great time.  (PS: the men washrooms our somehow funny and too tight... this is something they can certainly improve.. it isnt fun to wash your hands 20cm near someone who is just peeing)"}
{"text":"The Corner House, last night, was a wonderful evening of dining and conversation. I chose it for its purported intimate interiors, out-of-the-way location, and simple, yet delicious dishes and it delivered on all counts. We decided to sit outside since it was one of the first warm nights of the season, so I can't speak to the inside, but it did look just as nice as I've heard it is. The neighbourhood is lovely and quiet and you get the impression that you've stumbled upon a little secret.

We started with a glass of wine (the Shiraz by the glass) and a Pilsner Urquell. Their beer selection is wanting (only four?), but the wine was delicious. The service was friendly and prompt, if a little disorganized--we weren't sure which one our waiter really was. The bread was delightfully crispy, though they missed the mark with the butter, which was cold and not spreadable. A little annoyance.

For starters, I chose the beet salad with goat cheese and he had the mozzarella di bufala, both of which were refreshing and sumptuous. I loved the combination of the warm, salty goat cheese on the cold, sweet beets, accentuated by bitter arugula and radicchio leaves. 

For mains, he ordered the duck and I had the rainbow trout. The trout, accompanied by roasted potatoes, corn, and smoked bacon, was well-prepared and definitely flavorful. I tried his duck and it was glorious. My only complaint through this meal would be that the patio got quite dark, and even though we borrowed a candle from an adjacent table, we were still struggling to see our food properly. Better lighting out there, please!

For dessert, I ordered the macarons and he had the crème brulée. I had mentioned to the waiter earlier on that it was his birthday, and when they brought out his dessert they wrote \"happy birthday\" in chocolate on the plate. A nice touch!

All in all, a lovely evening of great wine, food, and hospitality. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for great, tucked-away dining."}
{"text":"It is rare that I am blown away by a restaurant, whether it be the food, the service, or the ambiance. Corner House definitely blew me away. 

I have now been here twice. The food is absolutely fantastic, and everything I have tried there was beautifully done and absolutely delicious. The grilled shrimp on the appetizer menu is mouth-wateringly good, and their mains come to you with the plate still hot and cooked to perfection. And while this may sound strange, but their mashed potatoes are the best I have ever had. You know a restaurant is good when even their sides are that good. And yes, it is THAT good.

The service is impeccable, and their servers are not only courteous but knowledgeable. I don't have enough good things to say about their service, you'll just have to go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Wow, based on some of the reviews I've read of Corner House, we must have caught them on a bad night.  We were a group of 5, and they made a number of mistakes.

* Hostess dropped the coat of one the ladies in our group, walked away.  When she noticed what happened, she said \"oh.\"  If it was my coat I would have hoped for the word \"sorry\" to appear at some point, but it didn't.

* Waiter tried to clear an unfinished plate.  Cutlery was resting fork on left, knife on right, tops of cutlery on the plate and handles on the table.  Food was 25% remaining.  Never in any restaurant I've eaten in have I seen a plate in this state cleared away.

* A loud crash of breaking plates came from the kitchen on 3 occasions during our meal.  3 separate occasions.  Another first for me.  Perhaps they were hosting a Greek wedding in the kitchen.

* I am assuming it was our waiter's first night, because I have never seen anyone so nervous on the job.  He came to our table and asked us \"haven't your appetizers arrived yet?\"    Luckily he didn't tell us to hurry up and go into the kitchen to get them.

* We were a goup of 5, and our entrees were brought in 3 stages.  The first-stage-people were finished about when the final-stage-people were served.

* Service was dreadfully slow, and the entire meal took hours (not \"lingering in heavenly bliss\" hours, but more like \"dear god where is that waiter so I can get the cheque and escape this drudgery\" hours).

* The food looked good, but mine was cold before I ate it (waiting for all to be served).

The buidling itself looks very nice, and the layout is quite neat (I'm a big fan of older homes converted into restaurants).  There are enough positive reviews here that I should probably give Corner House another try, but to be honest, my experience was so negative that I doubt I ever will (and, I find it hard to get the time to re-visit the places I really like, so forget about the places I really don't like)."}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite restaurant in all of Toronto.  I'm not a total foodie, but I can hold my own.  The staff is knowledgeable and courteous, the food is absolutely amazing, and the chef and the manager (a husband and wife team) make you feel welcome.  This is an great place to take that special someone for a special occasion (or to pop a question).

As an appetizer, I heartily recommend Seafood Appetizer Platter (the crab cakes are unbelievable)."}
{"text":"Who is the obnoxious broad on the front door?

My wife and I had dinner at The Cornerhouse during the summer. The service and food were excellent, and the waiter paired some nice wines with our dinner. However the hostess was rather loud, and seemed to be constantly barking orders at the rest of the staff. And there seemed to be alot of swearing coming from the kitchen, the 'f bomb' in particular.

Another couple invited us there for dinner last Friday evening. This was the first night of the Winterlicious restaurant festival here in town. We all arrived on time and that same hostess told us it would be a few minutes for our table. We waited for about twenty minutes. Hey, it's a weekend night in a busy place, and it happens. I felt though that they could have offered us a drink or a comp appetizer, but they did not. We finally got to our table and felt absolutely rushed from the start. Bread was plopped down even before we got water, and even before the waiter came over to say hi. 

The waiter then arrived and asked us what we would like to drink, and we were still trying to decide on our wine. He then asked us to order our dinners. It seemed they needed the table back in under an hour and a half. We took a couple of moments, feeling the constant gaze of the staff for us to hurry, hurry, hurry. Our appetizers arrived in record time, even before our wine arrived. My wife was still eating her app when someone cleared the other app plates. As soon as my wife was finished, someone swooped in and took her plate, and our dinners were immediately plopped down on the table. They didn't even change our cutlery that we used to eat our appetizers. Same thing with our desserts. The dinner plates were cleared, and our desserts were served before anyone offered us coffee. We did get new cutlery for our desserts. Our coffee arrived, and the waiter gave us our bill a moment later. We asked for coffee refills, and a moment later we could overhear that woman barking to the waiter that we couldn't have refills. Then, to make us feel more uncomfortable, someone came by and started to clear our empty water glasses, We hadn't even paid the bill yet, WHICH WAS OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS (four dinners, two bottles of wine, plus taxes) !!! We had been sitting there for only one hour and twenty minutes.

We were kindly told by the server that they needed the table back, as they had a considerable amount of reservations. I will point out that he seemed ill at ease, somewhat stressed out, as were the rest of the staff. I cannot imagine why. Could it be from that woman constantly harranging them? She wouldn't shut up. We paid our bill, and feeling sorry for the waiter, tipped him well, considering that it would be tough to work in a place like that.

THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A ZERO STAR REVIEW, BUT YELP WON'T ALLOW FOR UNDER ONE STAR. WE DID NOT ENJOY THIS EXPERIENCE, AND WE WILL NOT BE BACK. THEY OVERBOOK THIS PLACE FOR WINTERLICIOUS, AND HAVE TO RUSH THEIR GUESTS OUT TOO QUICK. THAT STINKS FROM GREED, THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. AND THEY GOTTA  DO SOMETHING TO SHUT THAT WOMAN UP. SHE HAS NO EFFING CLASS !!!"}
{"text":"What more can I say after reading these great reviews. I can't understand the few bad reviews. Went on the first day of Summerlicious and it was our second Summerlicious visit there. Last time was good to.I had roasted Goat Cheese, Cornish Hen( no bones) and strawberries with vanilla custard cake. Excellent!!
My wife had Tiger Shrimp, Strip Loin of Beef and Lemon Custard Tart. I sampled and it was good too. If I had any thing to complain about was the Wine List prices. Few under $50 and none under $46 a bottle. The listed wines were good but I'm sure the LCBO has lots good listings  in the  $18 range which should be under $40 at the bar."}

{"text":"Well, where I felt Toronto Yelpers led us wrong with Woodlot, they redeemed themselves with this excellent pick.  Best meal we had in the city.

Again, in from NYC and looking for great food and we definitely found it here.  There were no airs or pretensions put on.  Everything was simple and exquisite.  Every dish was planned and executed with precision and a humble grace.  The way good food was meant to be.

Do not miss this place if you're a visitor or a local.  We will definitely be returning on our next trip to our friendly northern neighbors.

Bon Appetit, Toronto!"}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious 2012. 

Our reservations were for dinner around 5:00pm. It was fairly quiet when we got there. The hostess took us upstairs and sat us in a little room that could hold three tables. We were the only ones in the room (until dessert came). It was quite cozy and romantic being served in a private dinning area of the house. 

I started with the Grilled Black Tiger Shrimp with a Fruit & Pumpkin chutney, spiced Ginger Pepper sauce. It was delicious! It came with two big pieces of shrimp that went so nicely with the fruit and pumpkin chutney. 

For my entree, I decided to go with the Crackling Cornish Hen with roasted Winter Root Vegetables, Medjool Dates, Fingerling Potatoes. Based on the good reviews for this dish from other Yelp users, I had high expectations. It turned out to be really really good! The outside of the chicken was crispy and the inside was moist and flavorful! I was very pleased with my dinner. 

For dessert, I ordered the Citrus Scented Cheesecake with Orange Salad, Grand Marnier Sauce. This tasted like regular cheesecake, with a bit of a crispy top that had the citrus taste. It was so creamy and smooth, tasted like it was freshly made. 

When our desserts arrived, the other two tables in the room were filled with more guests. I could over hear them saying how wonderful the food was too. The Corner House did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet and cozy night filled with delicious food. Definitely go to Summerlicious or Winterlicious -- it's too expensive to go on a regular day."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this cozy type dining for winterlicious and the food didn't disappoint. It really breaks my heart to have to rate this place 2 stars... and the two stars are for the food only.. The food was great. I had the beef tartar, trout and chocolate cake.

The real issue I had is with the service! My god was the service absolutely horrible.  I had a tall gentleman who barely looked twice at my boyfriend and I. He quickly took our orders and snatched the menus before we could ask him to suggest a good wine.  So... no wine.  We get our food and we are sitting upstairs in a small cozy room so we can see him serving other tables.. Apparently it's not that he's just a bad server in general, he just chose who to be a bad server too! He gave exceptional service to a larger table (probably to make tip) and to another table of 4 just beside us... so I KNOW he can be a good server... but because he thinks my boyfriend and I are younger than the other tables that we can't appreciate good service or won't tip well enough to his liking.  Too bad for his judgmental self as I tip quite a bit for great service as I feel that service really completes the food (even if the food was bad). We got our deserts without him even asking if we wanted coffee or tea (he acutally never came back to our table, it was a different waiter that served us our deserts) ... I shrugged it off thinking he'll be by to ask soon. Definitely not. .. but of course the table of 4 beside us he makes small jokes and asks them if they want coffee or tea and even now they take it and told his helper to make sure they get what they needed.  I was just appalled at his inconsistency and absolute rudeness in this! It's not like we were in a big room... we are right beside them! 

So we got the bill .. barely gave any tip and made sure he seen it. I hope he reads this and/or his boss! The food was great but he really killed the atmosphere! Doubt I will make the trip out there or tell others to go ..."}
{"text":"I went here for Summerlicious and would agree with the majority of reviews here that the food is quite good. The service, on the other hand is atrocious. We were a party of 3 and one of us was running late. The two of us that arrived noticed a sign written on lined paper taped to the door reading \"If you're here for summerlicious your entire party must be here before you are seated.\" I can understand why this policy might be in place at peak hours or any time a restaurant is filled to capacity, but Corner House was about 1/4 full when we arrived. The hostess, who I presume is also the owner based on newspaper clippings in the entrance, was rude and unprofessional. We were made to stand in the tiny entranceway for 20 minutes while we waited for our friend. We were not provided with any explanation or apology and we were certainly not offered anywhere to sit or drink while we waited (it was 42 degrees outside so a glass of water would have gone a long way). 

When our third party finally arrived the hostess took us to a room that was virtually empty (still don't understand why would couldn't have been seated and ordered a drink in the meantime). As I was choosing my seat, the hostess started clearing the plate and cutlery from my place. When she realized I wanted to sit there, instead of resetting the place she said \"oh, why don't you sit over there?\" I had to get up and squeeze into a corner seat that barely had enough room to move. 

We had planned on ordering glasses of wine but by this point we had all resolved not to spend a penny more than the summerlicious base cost. We would have gone elsewhere but there aren't really any other options in the area.

I'm growing quite tired of recieving second-rate service at restaurants as a winter- or summer-licious patron. If I were basing my decision solely on the food, I would return in a heartbeat. However, the service has driven me away from this place for good and I will encourage people to avoid it in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent. Went for winterlicious and was really impressed. I'd like to go back to try their pre fix menu as well."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Nothing terribly inventive, but well executed classics.

Only knocks on the place are price and the service is good, but a little awkward.  Somewhat hard to describe, but most of the time the service is very good but from time to time the waiter will disappear for slightly too long.  I partially chalk this up to the layout of the restaurant - it's a renovated house with tables located in different rooms, which makes it somewhat hard to navigate."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! I have dined at quite a few restaurants in the city. This is by far one of the best I've been to in a while. 

My girlfriend and I celebrated her birthday here with 10 of her friends on a Saturday evening. Her friends were a bit caught off guard that we'd be dining in a \"house\", but I read so many rave reviews of this place that I had to give it a try. We were given our own room. It was a little tight, but awesome. Our personal waiter was awesome. Personable, funny and very attentive. The food, amazing. From presentation, to taste, it really doesn't get any better. A table of 11, between us we all basically had something different from the menu. Not a single person had anything bad to say about any of the dishes. Nothing but compliments all around. I've never been to a group dinner where that has happened! Have you?! The desserts were also killer. Great portion sizes too.

The manager came up on many occasions to check up on us to make sure everything was ok. SO attentive, SO passionate. Incredibly personable and honest. We had an unfortunate wine spilling incident and let me tell you, the ENTIRE staff was up there helping us out. Soda water on hand, towels, the manager again came to make sure everything was ok. I can honestly go on and on about this place, but I'll spare you the novel.

Needless to say, we will definitely be back. I am incredibly impressed with this place. A very unique dining experience. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It is the perfect setting for a special occasion. The server was friendly and professional, the atmosphere was energetic, but cozy because it's divided into rooms creating an intimate ambiance. The food was so scrumptious we both had practically full glasses of wine at the end. The gnocchi was the best I've had since I was in Italy, and the prosciutto salad was delicious. I have already recommended it to several people as the perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"All I can say is Unbelievable!

It was \"expensive\", but the food and ambience was truly \"out of this world\"!!"}
{"text":"We heard that the Corner House was great for romantic setting and great food.  Overall, I'd say they delivered on the food, but the service/setting left something to be desired.

Pros: The food was awesome, almost every dish was perfect.  For appetizers we got the Carmelized onion tart, Baked goat cheese salad, and Beet salad.  Hands down favorite was the beet salad.  The beets were amazing, the dressing was great, and the portion was perfect.  The caramelized onion tart got rave reviews from other Yelpers but I found it a bit boring (nice but boring, just caramelized onions in a pastry crust, nothing interesting).  

For our mains, I got the Crackling Cornish Hen - perfectly juicy and flavorful, and the root veggies were amazing. Even included beets with the root veggies and sauce, and that was a cool touch.  My husband got the Venison stew.  He likes venison, I don't, so I'll just have to trust him that it was good.  

Desserts were nice, not especially memorable, but very pleasant and a good way to cap off the meal.

Cons:
-Limited menu: Winterlicious ended Feb 7, but for whatever reason, Corner House decided to extend their Winterlicious Prix Fixe menu.  The price for 3 courses is $35 (not including drinks, coffee/tea, etc.) which is a good price.  But we didn't go there to save money, we went because of its reputation for great food, and the prix fixe menu definitely had limited options, which was too bad.  I'd suggest they should make it clearer on OpenTable or whatever reservation channel that they're running a limited choice menu.

-Disorganized front desk: I've never been in a more disorganized, more chaotic waiting area.  We arrived for our reservation on time, and waited 30 minutes before being seated (they did give us champagne while we waited which was a nice touch, but 30 minutes is a long time to stand - no chairs!).  Because the restaurant is a converted old house, the foyer is big enough for about 3 people comfortably, and 6 people were jammed in waiting.  The kitchen is 4 steps from the waiting area, with an open doorway looking right in.  So while you wait 30 minutes for your table, you see the food being cooked.  Seems cool the first 5 minutes, but then you realize it's hot and chaotic.  The waiters have to push through the group of waiting diners every 5 seconds, so you're milling around like cattle trying to get out of their way.  Plus you hear a lot of the back-of-the-house grumbling from the waitstaff and chef (yelling at each other that they fired the wrong dish, sent plates to the wrong table, \"table 4 wants MORE bread, what!?!?\" and my favorite \"well, no one's closing out their bill so what the hell am I supposed to do?\")  It's not exactly the romantic relaxed environment the website advertises.  When you're eventually seated upstairs, the environment is cozy and relaxing, but I think the mood had kind of been dampened by 30 minutes in the pit downstairs.

-Inconsistent service: In their defense, they seemed to be having a gangbusters night that they didn't expect, so I guess their service team was just overwhelmed.  Our server was a nice guy, but so slow.  The meal last almost 3 hours, and not because we wanted it to.  There was a crazy long wait between each course, and after waiting 30 minutes for our dessert, the waiter ducked back in with the bill, only to realize we'd never even gotten the dessert....  

Overall, I'd suggest going on a less busy night (weekday maybe?) as I don't think they handle crowds well.  But the food is worth the wait, just be prepared to stand awhile before you get your table."}
{"text":"Would have never stumbled upon this place if it hadn't been for Yelp. Virtually no signs (apart from a very inconspicuous plaque) that would suggest that this is in fact a restaurant. But boy, was it GOOOOOD!

We got the whole room to ourselves on the second floor. The server was very courteous and attentive. The menu was not overwhelming (a dozen dishes or so), very well thought out and I believe everybody should be able find something to his/her liking. Everything about this place says high class: pre-warmed plates, everybody's food is served at the same time, old fashioned waiters with bowties... Well, you've gotten the idea.

We were served some freshly made bread with butter to tide us over while waiting for  the main course. I ordered the halibut (which was the fish of the day) with green leek mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables on the side. Everything was done to perfection and just melted in my mouth. My friends had scallops and cod fish and were equally impressed. Be warned that every dish is very rich. But hey, as they say in my home country \"you can't spoil porridge with butter\", and I stand 100% behind this adage. Oh yeah, even though they didn't make it, but the chilled Riesling wine was a perfect compliment to the fish.

Things you might want to consider:
- Ask to be seated on the second floor if possible, since the first one smells a bit like kitchen (this is understandable considering how small the place is).
- They have a set menu which actually is pretty good and has at least a third of the options from the regular menu. So check it out first.

Final verdict: expensive, but gives you a taste of what your daily evening meal will be like if... eh, I mean when you make your first million."}
{"text":"I went to Corner House for Winterlicious, and came away a bit disappointed. Unlike the other critical reviews above, I found the service quite good; it was the good that disappointed. 

The appetizers were fantastic. We had salmon lox, and a beet salad with goat cheese. The lox  were delicious, and the sauce around the lox was also fantastic. The beet salad came with both golden and regular beets. Before the appetizers came out we were served warmed bread with hummus. Both the bread and hummus were also very good. 

My issue with the food started with the mains. I had the venison chunks. The venison was dry and the presentation wasn't very interesting. We also ordered the roasted striploin. The striploin itself was good, but the mash potatoes were so salty. Fortunately the sauce that accompanied the meal soaked up some of the salt. All in all, both meals were average. 

We got the flowerless chocolate tart along with the buttermilk panna cotta. The tart was delicious. The chocolate was moist and the creme fresh a top was a great addition. However, the panna cotta was mediocre. It was heavy and had a jello consistency."}
{"text":"Very small but great service and the food id just good. I will have to try it again."}
{"text":"This was a surprise and a great one. My DH chose this place for my birthday dinner this weekend and I had no clue. It's located in the middle of a very residential neighborhood and you would miss it if you weren't looking for it. 
It's a beautiful old house converted into one of the coziest, most romantic restaurants in the city. We were seated rightaway at a corner table. The crowd was a little older than what we are used to downtown but the vibe was that of a classy neighborhood restaurant. 
Wayne, our server for the evening, was one of the most gracious servers I have come across in a while. He helped us pick a great bottle of wine, and was always attentive without being obtrusive.
I had the lobster bisque which had a wonderful concentrated flavor of the crustacean. I also tasted some of my husband's appetizer - grilled shrimp and it was a perfect balance of seafood and citrus. 
For my main I had the steak and he had the lamb. My steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked but the highlight was the grilled root veggies. I have never tasted veggies that are so perefectly cooked and tasted so fresh. They held their own in a beefy dish with a strong sauce. Kudos. My husband's lamb dish was sublime - perfectly cooked, tender and succulent.
For dessert we ordered the bread pudding. I am not a very big fan of puddings and had my birthday cake waiting at home so skipped it but the grin on my darling husband's face said it all.
We left feeling satisfied, pampered and slightly inebriated. I truly felt like I had been let into a very well kept Toronto secret. Sssssh! Don't tell anyone."}
{"text":"Since they extended their winterlicious 2013  menu into March, we decided to give it a try and we were very happy we did! This was mine and hubby's first time at this restaurant. The menu had lots of choice and everything we tried was delicious. I had the onion tart - excellent app choice, so delicate and savoury, came with a nice little salad. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Hubby had the salad with baked goat cheese - really enjoyed it too. For main course I had the striploin - done just right as ordered. The meat was one of the better ones I've had anywhere! So juicy and tender and flavorful at the same time.  The sides (mushroom, potatoes, and green beans) were also very well cooked, crisp and tender and very nicely seasoned.  Highly recommended. Hubby had the venison stew, really enjoyed that one too, but I liked my dish a bit more. For dessert we had the flour-less chocolate cake and the rice pudding. Both were very good. The chocolate cake was very very rich, like butter, but amazing flavour.  The rice pudding was a very generous portion, we had a hard time finishing all the food.  Service was attentive and quick and the overall atmosphere was romantic and cozy.  Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and would definitely come back here again. BTW, there is free parking on the small streets around the restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I ended up going to the Corner House as a plan B, but after our experience there we are so glad we went.

First, some painful back story. Thursday night my wife and I were heading over to Panorama. When we got there they told us that the place was closed for a private event (thanks for not posting that information on your website). So we went to the CN Tower. I will write another review for the CN Tower. Friday night, I decided to cover all my bases and make reservations to Panorama. About 3 hours later after I made those reservations, the manager from Panorama called me and told me they are canceling my reservation but that I could still \"walk in\". How lame is that. So I decided to check out the area and found The Corner House. At this point, it was already 8pm, so we made reservations for 8:30. A quick subway ride later, we were at the restaurant and seated. 

You can tell that this was a residential house turn restaurant. So it is a little tight in there, but seriously you won't care. The service was perfect and the food was amazing. We might not have had the \"view\" that we got from the CN Tower, but the food was leaps and bounds over the CN Tower....and it was lower priced to boot. 

Over all, we were both very happy that we ended up making it over to the Corner House. I guess we have Panorama to thank for screwing us over 2 nights in a row."}
{"text":"I went to the Corner House again last night for a family event and I was glad to see that nothing had changed! Service was still great, the same cosy ambiance and the Prix Fixe menu is probably one of the best deals you can get close to Downtown Toronto. 

They have a really good wine list and I also suggest trying the bottle of prosecco. It's quite a steal. I had the Niagara Prosciutto for my app, Black Angus Sirloin as my main and the Lemon Tart as my dessert. I had never had prosciutto paired with mini broccoli, but it worked quite well. The steak was delicious; lemon tart likewise--however, I didn't think the brulee addition on top of the tart was necessary as you already get a crunch from the tart shell. Just a personal preference.

Great spot!"}
{"text":"We came here for a romantic dinner during Summerlicious last Saturday.

We had a reservation, but the place was so busy, we ended up waiting for about 15 minutes. There's nowhere to wait except outside, so it was a good thing the weather was nice.

We sat in a room upstairs, which sat about 20 people or so. 

It took a while to get served, but it was Summerlicious, right in the beginning of the second seating, so it didn't bother us, we were out for a nice night.

He had the smoke trout appetizer, and I had the dairy-free mushroom soup. The soup was amazing, very flavourful and fresh. The trout appetizer looked very good, but I didn't get to try it because it LOOKED like it had dairy in it. Nathan's not really as into food as much as I am, so he didn't really say if it was good.

I had the salmon and he had the striploin for our mains. The salmon was cooked to perfection, and I really liked the veggies that came with it. Nathan said that the steak was good, the loved the sauce that was on the dish, and that the mushrooms were amazing. That is a huge deal, as he's not really into veggies at all.

For dessert, he had strawberries with vanilla ice cream on some kind of short bread. I told them I was allergic to dairy, so I will just have the strawberries. To my absolute delight, they brought me a dessert that was strawberries (that were in some kind of delicious syrup) with strawberry sorbet and meringue!! Most places that don't officially offer dairy-free desserts usually just stick some fruit on a plate and drizzle some coulis on it. I was very impressed that they invented a new dessert for me, and on a crazy Summerlicious night, no less!

So great food, decent service (slow, but it was a crazy night. Everyone there was very nice and personable) and wonderful atmosphere. We will definitely go back again. 

Their Summerlicious menu is extended until sometime in August!!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place during winterlicious. It may be much better the rest of the year, but at this time, not so much. Winterlicious really doesn't work when a restaurant approaches it begrudgingly, as this place does.  The rapport ranged from somewhat hostile (over the phone) to perfunctory with a side order of subtle prodding. We made very early dinner reservations and showed up on time during one of the worst winter storms. Despite that, we were told repeatedly in a variety of ways not to get too comfortable.  
The meals themselves were lackluster. Mushroom soup was dominated by something like raw garlic that quite killed the subtlety of the mushrooms. Beef dish was nice but nothing special. Desserts were similarly good but not great. The one exception was the black cod which was absolutely stellar, but not enough to compensate for making me feel unwelcome. 
I'm sure restaurants have mixed feelings about Winterlicious, but a good host soldiers on and continues to be a good host. Next year, this place should not participate in Winterlicious. I might have had a better meal here and Corner House could have stuck to their comfort zone."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to vent about this place since June 2009.  This is what you get when you mess with me on my birthday.

In the summer of 2008 I had a summerlicious experience at the Corner House that was GREAT.  I really enjoyed the local dishes and especially the apple-rhubarb crumble at the end of the meal.  I remembered this place fondly and spoke about how tasty it was very, very often.

So the next summer for my birthday the boyfriend takes me there for dinner.  I was really excited, got all fancy and could not wait.  It was the slowest service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  The entire meal took THREE HOURS.  I am not kidding, it was dark by the time I got home from a meal that started around 6pm.

I ordered the Cornish hen and it was like someone ate half of it and then baked it for a really long time.  Bones and dust. Then, the waiter tells us there is a wedding rehearsal dinner, that's why the food is taking forever.  Thanks for treating me like a valued customer."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last Winterlicious since I live in the area and drive by this cute place everyday.  It was a day of a huge snow storm and we ended up getting there early by mistake but since many people didn't show for their reservation, we got a nice corner seat.

The food selection for Winterlicious was great but I would like to come on a regular night. I am sure the menu would be impressive. 

The service was wonderful and the atmosphere in this place is unlike any other in the city.

If you are looking for a romantic place to go, choose here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic service, lovely setting - doesn't get any better than this!

I reserved a table online for their Mother's Day Brunch...a fixed price, 3 course sitting...and my mother and I both loved the whole experience.  It was quite busy - lots of family groups in there - and because the restaurant is within a lovely old home, it can get a little cramped but it really added to the atmosphere.  When the weather is a littler warmer - they have a lovely patio setting as well.

I had a wonderful Asparagus Soup with Chive and Lobster Dumplings (delish!) to start and my mother had a Melon Salad with greens and creme fraiche.  Then for the main brunch course I had a Wild Mushroom Torte with Grueye and Spinach (with a wonderful side salad), while my mom had Eggs Benny.  Then for dessert i had a wonderful chocolate torte and my mother had Tahitian Vanilla ice cream.  We topped the meal off with a couple of Mimosas and then tea...everything was a gastronomical delight...you can tell they put a lot of thought into their creations.

Our waiter was fantastic...he was super attentive and chatty without being intrusive.

Highly recommended if you need a special, intimate place to celebrate special occasions or if you just want to try a place that will satisfy your gourmet cravings!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but it disappointed me miserably when I needed it the most.  I arranged an important family dinner in this establishment from recommendations in Yelp.  I understand that it is the holidays, but I felt that the service was quite poor and that there could have been ways to alleviate the slowness in the food preparation.  As soon,  as we arrived the person who greeted us and took our coats was so nervous that she dropped our coats after hanging them.  I was under the impression that this restaurant has been in operation for a while but the mood of everyone serving was jittery with a side of unhinged.  After being seated our server was nice but seemed a little haughty and unsure as if it was a big bother for us to be there.  I did not understand the quiet hostility since we just arrived.  After we gave our food orders, we waited for an eternity for our food to arrive,  While waiting there were sporadic apologies from the manager but nothing really to give us much hope that the food would arrive any time soon.  While waiting we heard quite a few plate and glass crashes close by, which probably added to the delay.

When we finally got our food, we enjoyed it for what it was but it was not terribly spectacular for the price that we paid and the amount of time we waited for it.  But the worst server offence was when the server took away my companion's plate midway into the meal.  That was unprecedented and a complete shock especially since we waited a very long time to finally enjoy the food.  At the end of the meal we got lukewarm and belated apologies from the manager but nothing to really compensate us for the long wait.  After this experience, I will be hard-pressed to try this place again because there are far better places to spend my bucks with experienced staff and consistently good food."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant for a romantic date night or for an intimate group dinner.  The collection of small rooms throughout the house mean that there are never more than five or so tables in a room which keep it very intimate.  

I was a little concerned that this intimate atmosphere would make it difficult to get the attention of our server, however her check-ins were well timed and I never felt ignored.  She was helpful and knowledgeable.

The food is what really shines at the restaurant.  For mains we had the steak and the black cod which were both phenomenal and the reason for the five star review.  The steak was perfectly tender and flavorful - one of the best we've ever tasted.  The black cod just melts in your mouth which speaks to the quality of the fish and the preparation.  While I've had other soy glazed cod before, it's never been this good.

The wine list had a nice varied selection, however no bottle was under ~$42-50 which is a bit steep if you simply want a decent white."}
{"text":"I have now been here quite a few times, and every time I've been blown away by how delicious it was.  Last night I brought my family and my guy here for my graduation dinner, and everything was fantastic.  This was my first time ordering off the regular menu rather than the prix fixe. 

The calamari was AMAZING.  Cooked to perfection, and so flavourful.  

Crab cakes weren't stand out in my mind, but I'm not the biggest fan in general

I ordered the Rack of Lamb, and it was cooked beautifully and had fantastic flavour.  As did the vegetables and the potatoes.  

Other orders were the duck, the black cod, and the halibut special.  Everyone loved their meals.

I had the key lime pie for dessert.  It was very tasty - light and refreshing.  It was a small piece, which was okay considering how full I was from the meal, but I do enjoy a generous serving of dessert!

It's still my favourite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"The Corner House gets 2 C's: character and cozy.

It is a historic house-conversion and there is additional accommodation upstairs.  However, if you are dining with seniors, you may want to consider requesting specifically for the main floor dining room.  

I came here after attending The CoC's Tosca (which was phenomenal by the way!) for Winterlicious.  It should be noted that they are extending their Winterlicious prix fixe menu through March.  

We were seated on the main floor by the window.  The decor was very cottage-like.

The servers at Corner House are experienced (read, older) and our evening went by without a hitch.  It would've been nice if our server checked up on us to see how our meal was, but the service was still good.

I opted for the Roasted Pear & Goat Cheese \"Salad\" drizzled with bacon bits, and a mushroom sauce.  This was definitely delicious but in no way a salad as there were only a few pea sprouts that sat atop the roasted pear.  The base is a mushroom sauce, which is then topped with the roasted pear, and the sundried-tomato goat cheese (which was so creamy and yummy).  I loved it (my dining companion didn't seem to enjoy the salty/sweet combo though), and I like that our food came piping hot.

For mains we both opted for the Black Angus Striploin with mash, caramelzed onions and a Barolo red wine sauce.  Perhaps it was the cut of beef, but for me, the steak was just okay.  It was delicate like a rabbit as opposed to sturdy as a bull (or cow) should be.  It was cooked to my liking (medium rare) but I just wasn't satisfied with the texture.

For dessert I had the Citrus Scented Cheesecake, which, was delicate (as it should be).  Smooth but not heavy like store-bought cheesecakes.  

The only thing I would've liked was to have seen wines by the half litre.  Here, you can only get a whole bottle (in which case, check your keys at the door) or by the glass (don't look at your Visa bill!)"}
{"text":"Another lovely evening at The Corner House!  This time we were a party of four.  The atmosphere was as usual romantic, relaxed & cozy.  The service was brisk & efficient.  Our meals were comprised of appetizers (salad, soup, seafood platter), entrees (rack of lamb, steak, herring special) & dessert (apple strudel, sticky toffee pudding, cheesecake).  All of which were outstanding."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was excellent, flavourful and well portioned. Atmosphere was cute, cozy and intimate. I loved the the menu is full with dishes that were simple, but things that I cannot make at home, and unique ingredients that doesn't border asian cuisine.

The restaurant is in a small house, with different rooms everywhere. It accommodates lots of people, which means it could be a great place for a larger dinner party. My only complaint would have been that upstairs, although cozy, had a loud droning noise of the air conditioner; however, when the place started filling up, we didn't hear it anymore and it didn't bother me. 

Servers were nice, and helped me pick a nice wine to go with my meal. Wine by the glass were a bit pricey, but they were good quality ($10-12). 

We didn't get an appetizer, but I would love to come back for the prix fixe menu (Yelp Eats promotion, therefore didn't allow this).  I got the Duck Breast with some greens and gnocchi. It was so much more interesting sounding then just what I wrote there, and tasted even more amazing. 
\"Spice Rubbed & Maple Roasted Quebec Muskovy Duck Breast with...Forest Wild Mushrooms, Truffled Potato Gnocchi, Black Currant sauce\"
It was perfectly cooked and tender, and the gnoochi was few, but added that needed carbs to the dish. Size was a good size that left me full and with room for dessert. 

Conrad C got the Cornish Hen, which was my first choice, but went with the duck breast because it was something different. Oh em GEE, the small bite I had, I was jealous he got this and I didn't. Crispy skin, and the chicken flavour was explosive. \"Crackling Roasted Cornish Hen... with Winter Root Vegetables,
 Medjool Dates, Fingerling Potatoes, Natural Reduction\" Ridiculous. 

For dessert, all ($9.75) he got the 6 Macrons. I have to say, that I have had better, but they were very good. I got the Double Baked Milk Chocolate Cheesecake. Ok, so I'm not sure if I got the right thing, but I'm assuming they don't make huge mistakes like this. 
My dessert tasted like a soft flourless chocolate cake, and this was probably correct - however, the receipt said it was the Molten Cake. 
Now, I know all the desserts are the same price, and I checked with our server that I indeed got the correct dessert and not the Molten Cake. I'm not sure. 

I'll be back here. I think this is perfect for groups, special occasion, parents or just a day you feel like splurging a little for dinner, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Have been meaning to come here for a while, and finally ended up going with my girlfriend. Right off the bat, the restaurant set itself apart from other \"fancy\" establishments due to its setting in the titular \"house\". It's a unique setup, and provides the restaurant with a laid-back, romantic charm. Atmosphere is definitely one of the selling points for this place.

They have a pretty lengthy wine list, but we didn't end up having any on the night we went. However, it's good to see that the choice is there. We started off with the baked snow crab cake and the lobster bisque as our appetizers. The crab cakes were excellent, tender and spicy on a bed of avocados that really added a nice flavour. The lobster bisque was just okay, but still good.

Both of the main courses were exceptional. I had the Muscovy duck breast (I originally  wanted the elk striploin from their game meats menu but turns out they had run out of elk. Oh well, next time!). The duck was cooked medium rare, and it really is one of the best meals in general I have had in a long time. It was seared to perfection with just the right amount of pink and marbling to give it that extra flavour. the texture was flawless, tender without being soggy. The bed of vegetable medley that the duck was on was also fantastic, and could have been a great meal all by itself. My girlfriend ordered the cornish hen, which I also enjoyed quite a bit. The chicken was crispy and cooked just right, retaining all of its flavour.

For dessert, we shared the maple-scented creme brulee, which was, surprise surprise, also excellent. Silky smooth and not too heavy, we finished it in probably less than 2 minutes. 

Service was amazing as well. I unfortunately didn't catch out server's name, but he was attentive and courteous without being overbearing or cloying. Came around to check on us at exactly the right times.

All in all, it's about as good an experience as you can have at a restaurant in this price range in Toronto. A combination of atmosphere, food and service make the Corner House a winner. Would definitely recommend and revisit."}
{"text":"Winterlicious success, delayed review.
While I was concerned at first, when showing up right at our reservation time to find an entire stairwell of people waiting for their tables, that got cleared up within about 15-20 minutes and we were seated with menus in hand on the main floor.

Everything in our meal was great. I loved the chicken taco started and my wife was very impressed by the baby kale salad. The steak main was well prepared and the dessert rounded out the experience nicely. 
Service was rushed but did a good job given how busy the place was, so I'll give this a solid 4. If not Winterlicious I'm sure the extra attention to detail would've been there to maybe even give this a 5 star.

Bonus cool points for great atmosphere music (the were playing St Germain's \"Tourist\")."}
{"text":"I came here with a good friend to last week for Summerlicious. We had a reservation and we were seated right away in the front room. It was busy that night but the staff was quite quick in getting us a drink and taking our orders right away. 

We had a bottle of the Blackstone Cab from California. I had the smoked trout with avocado, tomatoes it was just ok for me...I didn't expect it to be served the way it was served it was more like a mousse...just not my thing. I was expecting like smoked trout like smoked salmon. My friend had the Prosciutto with reggaiano and arugula it was excellent. 

For our main I had the curried braised lamb with shitake mushrooms, celery and okra served over basmati rice. The lamb was quite tender and the curry was very flavourable. 

For dessert I had the strawberries with vanilla bean ice cream which was delicious. I love fresh strawberries. 

All in all it was very good and I would like to go back there during non-summerlicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here for winterlicious. The place looks \"cozy\" inside. They tried to fit a lot of tables and chairs into one small room. It's not a very private dining experience. You can hear everyone's conversations even if they are whispering. 

The WORST thing happened during dinner. My friend ordered soup for her appetizer and found a piece of glass in it. She told our server who quickly switched it to another option. They apologized, but nothing more was done.

My friend talked to the server again to inquire how the piece of glass got into the soup. According to the server, the kitchen staff try their best to be clean and organized, but sometimes things like that happen unfortunately. I do not agree with this. I think this mistake was a result of POOR CLEANING and HANDLING PRACTICES. 

This was the worst thing that happened to me and my friend. She almost ingested the glass - which the restaurant staff continue to claim it was only plastic. To clarify, the piece of glass was big enough for my friend to notice, and it was crystallized ( NOT PLASTIC). 

Also, their reaction was not sincere and reassuring. The manager came over eventually and became very defensive. She said that has never happened in 15 years. And then became accusatory. She asked my friend very rudely \"do you want $5 off your dinner? Is that what you were looking for?\" AS IF we came to the restaurant hoping to find glass in my soup just to score a free meal. VERY VERY RUDE MANAGER and one of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE experience I have ever witnessed. 

Also please note that my friend works in restaurant business. She is well aware of what goes in the kitchen and what proper customer service looks like. Of course mishaps happen in the kitchen, but the best way to handle something like that, was to investigate what happened and make it up to client in the best way possible. And BE TRUTHFUL. We all expect and deserve to trust the food and beverages we eat and drink. I felt like the manager and the servers were trying to make excuses for their mistake instead of simply owning up to it. 

Please do not go to this restaurant. The staff  are disrespectful and dishonest. 

We have reported them to the Toronto health department."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said. This place is fantastic, the ambiance and service are top notch, and the food is stellar.

When we walked in the server asked if there was any occasion we were celebrating. I said \"Well actually yes, it's my birthday\". He stuck his hand out and gave me a firm handshake and wished me a happy birthday.

I thought that would be the end of it, but nope, when they brought out my desert (chocolate brownie YUM), they had a sparkler in the middle of it and had wrote HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the plate in chocolate.

There was no ridiculous song singing or anything just a nice, simple gesture of service that is appreciated.

Will be going back for SURE."}
{"text":"Warning - if it's 40 degrees outside, I'd suggest you not eat here because the Air conditioning could potentially be broken... which it was for our situation, so I'll only comment on the food!

For Summerlicious this year, my bestest and I decided to try CH. For $35 - the menu looked delicious and totally worth it..... and it fact it really was.
Aside from the fact that we were pretty much sweating throughout our entire meal and needing to refresh ourselves with cold water every few minutes, I was extremely impressed with the food.

Fir appies - I had the salad with pear, endive, pecans and honey vinegrette.... it was nicely dressed, although I wish there were more pears in the salad. However the notes were very well balanced so I was quite pleased after the first course.

For the main - i really wanted to order the cornish hen because I had heard it was one of their signature items... but it was just TOO hot and I could not imaging eating something gamet in the heat.... so at last minute, I jumped off the meat wagon and decided to go with the salmon that came with a nicoise style salad. Afraid that my fish would be over cooked, i asked for it to be done a little under and I was extremely impressed with how it was spot on.  I love nicoise salad, and really liked how these vegetables were composed - the beans were crunchy but not raw, there wasn't an overload of olives, and potatoes on the side was great. The egg just completed the \"nicoise\" dish, although I don't think it was necessary. I'm not a fan of the garlic lemon cream, so it just took it off. 

For dessert - I noticed that their original menu (from the website) had changed, and so went with the new Trifle with Strawberries and vanilla custard. I have never tried trifle before and was really looking forward to it. It definitely did not disappoint - good amounts of custard and cake, and the strawberries were super fresh. It was a lovely way to end the night.

Our waiter was personable and pretty attentive, despite how busy the restaurant was. Not sure I would come here on a regular basis because it is a bit out of the way but I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go out for a special meal!"}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here for dinner.  After studying the menu before visiting, I was sad to find out that it was Winterlicious.  All that worked out... The Winterlicious menu was delicious and at a great price.
I had the Onion Tart.... oh yeah, great choice... :)  After some advise from the server, I ordered the rainbow trout... that complimented my appetizer. 
The ambiance was relaxing, romantic, comfortable.  The staff were inviting, friendly, engaging and helpful.
I'm now going to make this one of my Winterlicious/Summerlicious regular spots... :)
I will come back for the regular menu... some of those items looked sooo good."}
{"text":"Seriously enjoyed a nice meal at this very cozy and romantic little house on the corner of Davenport.  It's not cheap, that's for sure - for my husband and myself, a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 desserts cost us nearly $200.  Too bad we weren't there during Winterlicious to get more bang for our buck, but having said that, I'm still glad we went on an October evening for a date night.  I had the lobster bisque - it was a little watery, not as creamy or thick as I had imagined it would be, like a clam chowder or other bisque's I've had, but it was still flavorful.  I ordered the seared scallops for my entree and it was delicious.  Nicely charred scallops that were accompanied by their sausage risotto.  For dessert, I ordered the milk chocolate cheesecake wrapped in phyllo dough - that was rich and delicious.  Highly recommend something as unusual as that for dessert.  We had fine service and a good time.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here until strong recommendations from friends and coworkers. It definitely did not disappoint. If you come before 6:30pm, you can get the prix fix for $35, which we thought was a great deal. The bread and hummus that was complimentary at the beginning of the meal was delicious. They even give you more when you run out. There were lots of choices on the prix fix, and we particularly liked the cornish hen, the crab cakes, and the lemon tart. We also had the tuna tartar, the sea bass market fish, and the chocolate cake, which was all great as well."}
{"text":"After changing date after date after date to finally yesterday, my friends and I finally got to go to Corner House for dinner for their extended Winterlicious menu.

Tucked away on the corner of Davenport and Madison, Corner House was literally a tiny house with two floors.  Ambiance was great - dimmed a bit for a little romantic feel.

I ordered the following off the menu:
1) GRAVED LAX: Great little fresh appetizer to start your meal.  Paired with dill honey mustard to give it a bit of a tangy taste.  The fresh cucumber salad on the side was refreshing as well.
2) WHOLE ROASTED BLACK ANGUS STRIPLOIN:  This was absolutely amazing.  They don't ask you how they want it to be cooked - but it came medium rare (just the way I like it).  The mashed potatoes and the red wine sauce were just absolutely amazing.
3) BUTTER MILK PANNA COTTA:  Although I am a bit sick of panna cotta, I didn't feel like trying the two chocolate desserts (I'm not a big fan of chocolate desserts).  The panna cotta was a great way to end the meal - not too heavy, and also - quite refreshing and light.

I also got a chance to try a bit of the grilled black tiger shrimps - which were fairly good as well; venison chuck - which I didn't find to be too amazing, and the flowerless Belgian chocolate torte - which I found too heavy.

Service was impeccable.  Our waiter, Al, was very friendly and checked up on us every once in a while.

I was very impressed by the Corner House, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a romantic night out or an intimate dinner with some good friends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now....both on romantic evenings (once for Valentine's Day). it is a very romantic place that is perfect for any date. It is a small, intimate house that is very 'warm' in the wintertime (with a fireplace lit up with candles).  The ambiance is just amazing, and the service is also top notch.

The first time I ate here, I would give the place a definite 4 stars. The food was very good, although I cannot remember what I ate.  The last time I ate here, the food was just \"good\".  We had the goat cheese appetizer to start off, which was really good. Warm goat cheese on a flaky pastry, with lots of yummy greens surrounding.  The main meal was much to be desired. The lamb was really good -- tender and cooked perfectly -- but the bed of 'stuff' it was on what a bit strange. There were root veggies which were much too salty under the lamb (cooked in a red wine reduction) and an unidentifiable pasta-like carb that was also included (which tasted horrible).  

Would I go back? Probably.  The ambiance alone makes this a fabulous retreat from the hussle and bustle of the city."}
{"text":"This is a quiet, romantic spot for dinner, with a nice looking patio outside. We came for Summerlicious and weren't blown away, but the dishes we had had good potential and were beautifully presented. The service was excellent. We will likely go back to try out the regular menu."}
{"text":"I went there for a birthday celebration a few years ago.  The ambiance was really good and I found the food good as well.

I noticed the prix fixe menu they have now and want to go try it out."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I've been here twice now and both times the food was just excellent.

First of all the atmosphere. This is really a place for special occasions and nice dates. I suppose you could drop in on an off weeknight, but reservations are a must on holidays and (winter|summer)-licous.

The first time I went I had the digby scallops in the red pepper sauce. Amazing. The scallops are so buttery they melt in your mouth. The scallops are grilled and put on top of a bed of stewed vegetables. The red pepper sauce has just a hint of spice and a nice kick to it. perfect accompaniment to the succulent scallops. Best of the dishes I have tried there (I sampled my friends' dishes as well)

The second time I went I had the elk. It was grilled to a medium-rare perfection and had a nice and not overly gamey taste. It came on a bed of roasted vegetables and egg noodles, and it was all bathed in au jus. Very nice. 

The company I was with always loved their dishes as well. I will say none of the appetizers have been anything to write home about. The flavours in many of the starters tend to be very subtle. I think this is intentional.

Not the cheapest place, but save it for a nice night when the occasion warrants."}
{"text":"Great second visit. We had the crab cakes, Caesar salad appies. We had striploin, scallop mains. The sauce for steak is as good as the reviews say. The Caesar and crab cakes were very good. The scallops the wife had were good. But personally I would have liked to see more os a sear. 
Seating is intimate, more like cramped, but expected. 
The 2reds for wine we had were good as well."}
{"text":"It's that time of year again, mom's coming for a visit and she wants to take me someplace fancy for dinner.  Of course, though the thought of going to an upscale restaurant paid for by mother's pocket is a lovely one, I am somewhat daunted by the task of picking some place out.  I mean this isn't Winnipeg -- my hometown and the city from which my mother is arriving -- Toronto has more than 2 fancy restaurants to choose from.

I am very self-conscious about Toronto, it often stumbles over itself in an attempt to prove that it is better than anywhere else in Canada and the restaurants often seem to tread on that same tumultuous path.  

The Corner House however, a quaint, beautiful home cum restaurant at the foot of Forest Hill is a lovely alternative to all the fake feng shui of Toronto's current eateries.  Te menu is fabulous, everything to warm one's soul from Lobster Bisque to Filet Mignon.  Like a house, the dining area is set-up in different rooms.  It is great for a large party because you can get a room to yourself."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place!  Evidently they don't get many tourists.  We chose this place based on the Yelp reviews.  We loved everything about it from the amazing beet salad to the sassy waiter.  Good thing we had our GPS otherwise it would have been hard to find.  We shared just about everything between all of us (5) and loved it!  The calamari, beet salad, lobster bisque, Quebec grown duck, scallops, and fiddleheads were amazing.  The salmon special was the least of the dishes but still excellent.  The creme brulee was exactly what other restaurants creme brulee merely aspires to be.  Our waiter was just the right amount of sassy and gave us great service.  We left feeling satisfied that we found a gem."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and an intimate atmosphere.  That about sums up my review about this place.  The hubby and I were very happy to have found this gem!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious dinner: We had our reservation for 10:15pm on Saturday and it was still packed when we got there. We waited for about 15 min before we got seated upstairs in one of the rooms.  

This restaurant is literally a house in a corner and the dining rooms are situated within various rooms of the house. It's pretty neat, cozy and romantic. If you are taking TTC, get off at Davonport Stn and walk few blocks north on Spadina.

For my appetizer, I had the ginger-curry spiced carrot & sweet potato soup. I don't usually get soups but this turned out to be excellent soup with the right amount of spice and home-made warmth to it. 

My main was bit disappointing but now looking back at the menu, I should have read the menu more carefully. \"Whole Roasted Black Angus Striploin with Yukon Gold Mashed Potato, Crimini Mushrooms, caramelized Onions, Barolo Red Wine Sauce\". Well I completely ignored the \"whole roasted black..\" part so when the dish came out, it was different than what I expected.  Either way, the outsides of the meat was almost burnt and had this bitter taste to it. We had to cut off the outsides of the meat.  The quality was meat was good, just too burnt on the outsides. The main dish overall was heavy and too salty.

For my dessert, I ordered Wild Blueberry, Cranberry & white Chocolate Bread Pudding, Rum caramel sauce. Well it was literally wet bread and wasn't that tasty. I did not finish my dessert which is quite rare.

When we asked for a second basket of bread (which was really good btw the first time), the waiter finally brought us a basket but the bread was pretty much burnt on the outer edge. He said that there was a table that liked their bread very crispy and they apparently made them extra 'crispy' so he hoped that we didn't mind. 

It took them awhile to bring our desserts..it was past midnight at this point and most of the people had left the restaurant..We waited for like 15 minutes after they took away our main dishes and I eventually had to ask one of the waiters if they had forgotten our desserts.  

When it was time to pay (it was getting late and the room was getting cold, i felt like they had turned off the heat on us!), the waiter was nowhere to be seen. I had to take the bill and walk around the house to see if there were anyone left in the house! 

My friend and I still had a good time but the main dish and service ruined what could have been a perfect night.

I would give this restaurant another chance but not with winterlicious/summerlicious and I would go during a more reasonable hour when there are more people working. I think this place could be quite romantic place to go dine if done right and food quality can be pretty up there as well."}
{"text":"We have always had wonderful meals here during Summerlicious -- so we were long overdue for a 'proper' meal.

We ordered fish & pumpkin ravioli. Everything tasted wonderful - great flavour combinations! Presentation was a bit disappointing - esp. for the ravioli which was swimming in a greyish sauce & laden with olive oil (yikes!). While the taste over-delivered, the plate presentation was 1/5 stars.

Heavenly lemon tart. 
Very good service.
Would recommend for date night dinner!"}
{"text":"So delicious, excellent ambience, warm and inviting service. 
Really this is a great place. I've been meaning to get here for quite a while now and finally did for a celebration dinner. We had an entire room to ourselves and it felt like I was in someone else's mind. Almost like if Barbarians was my grandfather's play spot, then Corner House would be my grandmother's.
What i love about this place is the fact that it has this old traditional charm. Now this is becoming rare in Toronto, but what sets Corner House apart is that the food is exceptional as well. I had shrimps that were 15/16 size and yet still somehow also tasted fresh (which i know they weren't, but I need to know who their supplier is). I had the venison stew which was rich and delicious and sweet and savoury and everything to give your mouth an oral O that you will remember for days to come."}
{"text":"the kitchen is extremely competent, but you can probably get better, more inventive food in toronto.  however, when you combine the service with the ambiance, the corner house is very hard to beat."}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious. My appetizer was a chicken taco, main was a venision stew with some sides, and my appetizer was the belgian chocolate torte. I did not like the venison at all (again depends on the palate of the person). Personally, it felt like a knockoff a filipino dish called beef caldereta. Plus the sides tasted better than it. I did enjoy the appetizer and desert though."}
{"text":"Expensive for cheep tasting dishes. Not sure why this restaurant has good reviews, but I spent over $200 for a night on Valentines Day (bought some fish w/veggies, one glass of wine and a shared desert - I don't even remember the appetizer, it was some basic salad). Their menu was almost 3X the regular price for a basic no choice pre-fix. 

The restaurant is in an old house, with bad heating and no air, so I do not understand the cost of the food - probably they overcharge for upcoming renovations.

Save your business for other/better places."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice so far and each time has been a magical time! About a year ago my boyfriend took me here for out first date. I ordered the rainbow trout and it was delicious! Everything that I ordered was amazing. 

What I really like about this place is that it is a prix fixe menu throughout the whole year. This year for Valentine's Day my boyfriend brought me back to this place and they had a special menu for this special day! 

1) Marinated Local Beet Salad with Truffeled Pecorino, Micro Greens & Roasted Hazelnut -- I absolutely loved this delicious salad. It was really refreshing and the cheese was so good! 

2) Whole Roasted, Dry-aged Y.S. Prime with Striploin, Yukon Gold Whipped Potatoes -- I was craving meat this day and this definitely hit the spot for me! I would've ordered the Venison but this choice sounded really good, and when it came out the meat was cooked to perfection! That whipped potatoes was so fluffy and soft!

3) A Sweetheart Dessert... for 2! -- So we had no idea what was for dessert that's exactly what it said on their menu and when it came out we were surprised! It was beautiful there was chocolate hazelnut mousse,  chocolate, raspberry coulis, chocolate covered strawberry and some creme fraiche! Delicious and it was beautifully and carefully presented. I'll post pictures up soon I promise! :) 

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there's no parking! We had to park across the street in an office parking area... they were closed so I'm sure that they didn't mind. I also over heard another couple beside me talking about the parking and it seems as though they did the same as us! ;) 

- CL"}
{"text":"I've ridden my bike by this place dozens of times and always thought I should stop in and give it a try, so last night I took my lady there and it didn't disappoint.

We got there just shy of 6:30, which meant that we could get their Prix Fixe menu from Summerlicious.  

The two appetizers we got were the smoked trout with avocado on sourdough crostinis and a chilled cucumber and dill soup.  I hate cucumbers, so I can't comment on the soup, but the trout was excellent and the presentation was gorgeous.  Bonus marks here for them using the herbs from their own herb garden.  It's neat to see the chef pop out of the kitchen and come back a minute later with a handful of various leaves.

For our main dish, I got the cornish hen on mashed potatoes with some lightly stewed veggies, and she got the angus steak (rare) with roasted veggies.  The cornish hen was amazing, and the vegetables still had a bit of crunch, which I think is key (soggy and limp vegetables are awful).  The only downside I think was that the presentation was a little sloppy, but that's a very minor point since the flavour was great.  The steak was still a bit tough, and slightly overseasoned, although it was cooked to the right temperature.  Not sure what went wrong here - maybe it was just a tougher cut of meat than it should have been).  Presentation on this dish was not a problem - looked great on the plate.

Dessert was the lemon curd with berries and home-made vanilla bean ice cream with berries.

The waiter, by the way, doesn't fancy himself a bartender, but made a nice vodka martini for me and a very strong sour apple martini for the lady.  Kudos to him.

If I could, I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but the slightly tough steak and slightly sloppy presentation on the cornish hen bring it down a bit for me.  Nevertheless, this is right up there with Olivia's on Clinton as the best dining I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular as usual but the service has gone downhill considerably.

We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation, and were happy to wait had they asked us. Instead we were guided upstairs to wait in a narrow hallway/staircase, dancing a waltz with waiters coming and going. Then we were finally brought back downstairs and seated. Our server was really strange. His demeanor was very off putting and he seemed to be in a rush/unconformable. It was nothing like when I came here in 2011, our server then was very good. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that for every single course we were missing utensils. The bread did not come with a butter knife to spread the dip. Our mains and dessert were on the table without any utensils, thankfully a busser noticed and got us some. Not our server, strange!

When our bill came we asked for a cab. There was snow storm that day and we were told the cab would be a while (we were okay with that), then were asked the vacate the table (makes sense, we're happy to wait in the entrance), right after that  we were told the cab may not even come and were pretty much ushered out the door. I don't think they called the cab and just wanted us to gtfo.

The signage on the washrooms are awful. My fiance told me that there were 2 women in the men's washroom...thinking it was the women's washroom and giving him dirty looks. I don't want to blame the stupidity of some people on the restaurant but I almost made the same mistake too, had a lady not exited the women's washroom a bit further down.

I'd come back for the food but not with the same enthusiasm as I've had in the past."}
{"text":"I was eager to visit The Corner House after noticing its place at the top of Yelp's 'Best of Restaurants' list for quite some time, and the perfect opportunity arose when I noticed that it was participating in Winterlicious. I made a reservation for 2 for 5:15pm on a Sunday, and we arrived right on time and were seated promptly in one of the upstairs rooms. 

We received warm bread and hummus/olive oil to nosh on - a nice change of pace from the usual olive oil/vinegar. I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad to start, the Ricotta and Spinach Gnocchi as my main, and the \"Flowerless\" Belgian Chocolate Torte for dessert (I'm not sure if that was a spelling mistake on their menu or if it was an attempt at humour...somehow I feel it was the former rather than the latter). I also ordered the suggested wine pairing for my main from the menu (a Pinot Noir I believe). I appreciated the fact that they thought to suggest a wine pairing for each main course, as the wine list is fairly extensive. My lovely dining companion ordered the Salmon appetizer, the Cod main and the Panna Cotta dessert, as well as the suggested wine pairing.  

We both had no complaints about our meals - everything arrived very quickly, and was fresh and flavourful. Presentation was beautiful as well. I thought the shining star of my meal was the gnocchi, which was soft and pillowy and satisfied all my gnocchi needs. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. Our server seemed completely disinterested and we felt really rushed. As he was approaching the table beside ours, he slid our bill onto the table without a word before we were even finished our dessert. When I flagged him over to ask if we could possibly have separate bills, his response? \"No.\" It was only after a confused, \"Excuse me?\" that he said he could just charge half of the bill onto each of our credit cards. He then proceeded to bring over the card machine, charge my card, and walk away while it was processing. Someone else eventually came over to complete the transaction, and when our server finally re-appeared several minutes later, he said to my friend, \"You couldn't figure that out yourself?\", suggesting that she should have charged her own card in the name of efficiency. She insisted that he was joking, but I didn't get a warm, jovial or friendly vibe from him at any point throughout the night.  

Also, the atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty romantic, dim lights and all, but I found the tables to be squeezed really close together and the loud party of six seated right beside us was slightly overwhelming. Our table was tucked into a corner and I literally had to MacGyver myself into my seat by pulling the armchair out completely from under the table, sitting down, and sidling back into the corner. As we were leaving the restaurant (after practically being shoved out the doors by our server), we had to shuffle past a horde of people lined all the way up the stairs, and I didn't even have room to put my coat on before stepping out into the biting cold.    

Overall, the food was spectacular (totally five-star worthy), but somehow I went away from the experience with a bad taste in my mouth due to the awful service. I can appreciate that restaurants and their employees are under a great deal of pressure during -licious events, but in my opinion the service we received wasn't bad in an \"I'm-so-busy-I've-been-turning-over-tables-all-night-long-and-getting-less-tips\" kind of way, but more of a flat-out rude kind of way. In contrast to the excellent -licious meal I had had the night before at another restaurant - service and all - I was really disappointed here. I would probably give The Corner House another chance for a date night, as the food and décor are lovely, but given that there are no dates in my near future I probably won't be rushing back here again."}
{"text":"I usually really skeptical about Summerlicious anything... because a lot of time you ended up with mediocre food and disappointment. 

However my experience at The Corner House Restaurant was so good during Summerlicious ($35) and in fact they going to extent the menu till 20th August and I might just come back for another meal!!! 

Love the setting and the location of The Corner House Restaurant, closed to Dupont Subway Station/Casa Loma and great area to walk around after and before the meal admiring all the houses.... 

I would definitely recommend dining here on a summer evening on their Patio! Surrounded by planters overflow with flowers, under the shady mature trees and with the light breeze of Summer.... so in tune with nature until my Yelp Drinking Buddy start crushing all the ants trying to attack him! 

My Summerlicious Choice ($35) with the help of my waiter: 
- Niagara Shaved Prosciutto with Spring Salad 
- Organic Tilapia with Summer Vegetables and Couscous 
- Caramelized Lemon Cream Tart 

All nicely done and enjoyable. Fresh ingredients and great if you are health conscious!! But for me as long as it taste good, and eating health is always a bonus!"}
{"text":"I feel Corner House needs better portion control. The plates varied in sizes. The sizing was  very inconsistent. The service is not up to par for a higher end restaurant with over 10 years of experience. I expected more from Corner house. The restaurant was disorganized."}
{"text":"I chose Corner House as my Winterlicious restaurant this year. I was not disappointed at all! The food was excellent and everything was lovely. Nestled in the foothill of Casa Loma, the restaurant is tucked in a cute little house. Which means that space is severely limited, and people had to wait on the stairs for their seats.

Appetizers: both the ginger-curry spiced carrot and sweet potato soup were excellent. The soup was creamy and satisfying.

Mains: the whole roasted black Angus striploin was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The red wine sauce went really well with all the accompaniments. The homemade spinach ricotta and gnocchi also came with a delectable sauce. 

Desserts: the bread pudding was not too memorable, but the butter milk panna cotta was really good. The tart raspberry sauce was a nice contrast to the sweet and creamy pudding. 

I definitely recommend everyone to try out the Corner House!"}
