{"text":"Phenomenal and unique mix of flavors! Definitely get the cauliflower! Homemade wild mushroom pasta with truffle butter and a massive piece of porkloin with a homemade tomale on top. The bread pudding also didn't disappoint! Highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went the first night acorn was officially open. I usually avoid restaurants that new to avoid the learning curve.  The service and food were so spectacular I never would've known it was the first night. Someone in our party asked how long they've been open. We were shocked to hear the answer.  We took friends back for a second visit and were equally pleased.  Acorn makes the ordinary extraordinary. The bean side and the beet side were mouthwateringly delicious.  The bread was as well.  Every bite of each thing we ordered was enjoyed thoroughly.  Four of us split the monkfish. The server was very informed and patient.  He took the time to explain the menu and never pushed us to order more than we were comfortable. His feeling was that we could always order more.  Save room for dessert.  Both offerings are exceptional.  We ordered one of each both visits because we couldn't choose. They're delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a new very hip location in town. The vibe is great. Food is decent price. I got the rabbit lasagna which was superb. And the bread pudding is to die for. The menu changes every week or so, so it never gets old."}
{"text":"My new favorite in town! The dishes are healthy and packed with wonderful seasoning.

Strongly recommend the Wedding Soup and breakfast omelete."}
{"text":"Food was really tasty and the service/environment was great. The portions are incredibly small or expensive for that amount of food though. My friend and I decided to taste a few different things, so we ordered 4 small plates and the bread pudding to share. Everything came was literally to taste ~$14 for only 2-3 bites. The dessert portion was Ok and we didn't try the entrees, so it might be the way to go. Honestly, there are so many great \"upscale\" restaurants in Pittsburgh where you actually pay the same amount of money but not leave like you went for food tasting. They will have to adjust the prices. In fact, it was not very crowded for a saturday night and this might be the reason. As of food, the gnocchi was my favorite, again I wish it was a little bigger. The cocktail I got was also a bit too sweet, the prices seemed ok though - wine was still a bit pricey and there weren't many options.. overall, I really think they have a great chef and it is a nice restaurant in a good location. Hence the 4 stars.. If they adjust the prices, I think it has the potential to become one of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh. Otherwise, I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I lived near Walnut Street for 2 decades. I moved away to Seattle and was in town visiting. Let me tell you, this exceeded expectations for what \"good\" dining could be in Pittsburgh. This place is on the higher end for Pittsburgh, maybe about average for New York or Seattle. But the food is on par for what you might expect at a good big city restaurant, and the service was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place if you want a higher-end date that isn't too formal, or if you want a great dinner with a group of old friends you haven't seen for a while and you're trying to convince them to move back to Pittsburgh. ;) We tried the charcuterie (huge, meant for 3-4 people), the Brussels Tartine (AMAZING), Tortana (good), and the main pasta entree. Everything was good or amazing. The beer selection was on point. I was impressed. Would return here the next time."}
{"text":"Gotta go 5 stars here...and I'm happy, Pittsburgh has finally added another forward thinking menu to its quiver. 

We had lunch, and it was hands down the best lunch in the city. Yes, better than Pamelas you yinzr slug.

I would like to especially mention the wedge salad...as a lover of the wedge salad, it's nice to see someone (other than Avenue B) take it seriously. It was next level stuff, I honestly couldn't stop starring at it. 

Can't wait for dinner.

..................had dinner...and ya, still five stars. 

Had the cauliflower / smoked beets / Steak Diane for two 

- 'cauliflower' is spelled weird

- smoked beets...I would honestly just stop in for those, it's THAT good.

- Perfectly cooked and well dressed Steak Diane. The mushrooms were cooked the way they should be, not too much. 

Great night....however, I would like to mention, if the owner is listening, you need double doors...make that upgrade a priority. It's 6 months out of the year here and anyone sitting towards the front....well, you see what I mean"}
{"text":"Omg! So much good food! What's cool about Acorn is that you can share the left side of the menu. My friend and I shared four things. We tried the Bread and Butter, Gnocchi, Octopus, and the last thing I forgot the name of. The pics are attached. As yummy to eat as they were to look at!"}
{"text":"This is actually a very attractive restaurant - what they have done with space that was formally an Asian restaurant is surprising. The space has a good feeling of a casual bistro. I have to say that initially we were extremely shocked when they handed the wine list to us There was literally only one bottle of wine for under $50.  Many were in the $70 range - with the average maybe being $100. (We eat in a lot of upscale restaurants and even world class restaurants all over the world, so we know wine prices.)  My husband was being sort of irritable with the waitress about the wine - owing to the fact that we had just arrived home after 19 hours of travel from Europe. I have to say that she handled his pointedness extremely well. While I know they are trying to do \"upscale\" food, this kind of a wine list is not fitting the type of place or price point of the food. That said, the GM came over and said that the waitress told him that we had been shocked by the wine list prices and he told us that they were currently in the process of reviewing this and correcting it. He also comped us wine that he was considering buying for the restaurant - which he certainly did not have to do. As far as food - I must say that my husband and I actually prefer menus that don't list so many of the ingredients ... as we find that you can often find something in the dish that you don't want if you scrutinize too closely. Additionally when we asked about a couple of the dishes, while many ingredients are listed, we learned some significant element that probably should have been mentioned was left out. This seems to be a recent trend - not specific to Acorn! Aside from that I must say that the food was excellent. It was beautifully presented, the portions were for appropriate for the price, and perfectly cooked. We had the short ribs appetizer as well as a crudo appetizer, and then we had the rib steak for two. The steak was perfectly done and the flavor was exceptional. Overall this was a lovely meal and I think with a couple kinks worked out, it should do great."}
{"text":"The place is very pretty, food, cocktails, and service were very good. The best thing about Acorn though is finally a new restaurant / bar on Walnut street. Shadyside is desperate for more places like this"}
{"text":"Adored this spot. Our mid-week summer lunch was perfection. A clean modern mid-century ambiance set the tone for a simple edited menu of food. And that food was outstanding, served by a jovial engaging staff.  My only wish is that I'll be able to enjoy their weekend brunch, which I know would be pure bliss!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and everyone was super welcoming.  Our server was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu going out of her way to explain vegetarian options for my wife. 

The menu is rather small, but has a decent selection of vegetarian options and varied starters.  The main course options are very limited unless your are able to share with a larger group.  Half of the options are recommended for 2-4 people sharing.  Something to consider for a couple with different palates.  

The cocktails were tasty and well thought out.  The $14 glass of cab was pretty average.  Perhaps it had been opened the day before and was not sealed well.  Lacked depth and was a bit hot, but not bad enough to send it back.  

We shared a beat salad which was nice and had a mix of textures and flavor profiles.  My wife enjoyed her mushroom pasta.  My lamb dish was below average.  Lamb was served 3 ways but the star of the dish was a tough and over cooked tenderloin.  I could not consume 1/4 of it due to tendon and connective tissue and even had a small bone it.  Overall it was just a middle eastern spiced mess of lamb.  

I would give 3.5 if available, but the lamb dish and limited selections don't warrant 4 stars."}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars if I could. Scott, the chef, and the entire staff are absolutely top notch. Everything was delicious and the service was perfect. We will be back as often as we can be (and maybe a few times more than that)."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having our anniversary dinner here. Food is very good. This is a very expensive, very noisy, very uncomfortable restaurant. $62 for monkfish for two. The real problem is the noise. Ridiculous. We had to shout to talk at a dinner table far away from the bar. The wooden chairs are painful. I never have back pain, but promise you will after sitting in these torture chamber chairs. Did the chef not sit in them before he bought them? Unless you lean back real far (which is a hard way to eat), you will have piece of wood gouging your back the entire meal. The drink \"life is a peach\" had no peach flavor at all. The food is good, but the ambiance made us want to get out of there asap. No offer of anything for our anniversary.  Bill was over $200 with tip, only one drink each. Very disappointing. One and done."}
{"text":"Stopped by for cocktails last night.  I ordered a bourbon cocktail and my boyfriend got an old fashioned.  Both were watered down.  One of my pet peeves is chunky ice cubes in a drink that hits your face as you try to drink it and these were it.  Not my first pick if I wanted to spend $25 and get my money's worth."}
{"text":"This was a star-rating struggle for me.  They did have some redeeming qualities, but I didn't love the place and I doubt I would return.   Here's the scoop.  

The good:  
- The service was excellent.  Everyone was very friendly and the server was knowledgeable.  She described each dish in perfect detail and was formal without being stuffy.   
- The place is pretty.  I sat on a bench seat and was comfortable.  
- The food LOOKS great.   Top notch presentations on all of the dishes.   
- The cocktails we tried were tasty.   

The bad: 
- Reservation process - they use a website called Tock, which did not work on the three occasions I tried.  I finally had to call.   
- Limited menu.  I was totally fine, but if you have a dietary restriction, you have very limited selections.  
- The food didn't taste quite as good as it looked.  While the dishes were all very pretty, they all lacked a little something in the flavor department.  
- This place is more expensive that it seems. The couple of entrees ($26-$35) we got were very reasonably sized in the protein department, but the sides were just garnishes.  You'd really want to order a small plate in addition to add some balance, bringing the total to $37-$48.  The small plates were small.  The three vegetable options were barely 1/3 cup total and they ranged from $11-$13.  Drinks were also on the pricey side.  I got the pork entrée and two glasses of house Pinot Gris and my total was around $75 with tip.  I wasn't hungry when I was done, but I didn't feel like my $75 was well spent either."}
{"text":"I want to thank Randy, the manager, for responding to my yelp review. I really appreciate it! I understand now the reason that you seemed aloof given the frustration you felt. I will definitely give acorn another chance. Thank you Randy!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for four a few weeks in advance and was easily able to get the target time of 7:15pm.

Positives:

1. Great food, with very unique and interesting vegetarian options. I had the salt beets, and the rigatoni (house made!) with a black truffle-nori sauce and lobster mushrooms. I was very impressed.
2. Wonderful service. I brought my aunt and mother, who are very demanding (changing orders, changing tables, etc), and our waitress handled it all beautifully, even rushing a last-minute order of the whole fried chicken.

Less positives:

1. The chairs are super uncomfortable - all four of us were different heights and we all somehow found them difficult to sit in.
2. Not all of the tables are good - the combination of high bar stools and low booths means that many tables have a view of other peoples' butts 
3. Because it's farm-to-table, the menu changes often. If you have dietary restrictions (e.g. being vegetarian) you should call them and make sure there will be something for you to eat.

All in all, a nice experience - will be returning!"}
{"text":"We were very excited about Acorn before it opened. We tried it when it first opened. The food was very expensive, and it left a lot to be desired. We were disappointed because we live in the neighborhood, and we expected much better. We decided to give it another try. We have been a few other times for drinks, and the bar tenders are very pretentious, and border line rude. Many of our friends agree. It is sad because we were hoping for this Walnut Street restaurant to be a staple in our community."}
{"text":"Pricey but tasty food. Not exactly very vegetarian friendly but still there are a few options."}
{"text":"For many years, I have found the restaurants on (and near) Walnut to be somewhat disappointing. Some are just plain bad, but even the ones that serve good food tend to be conventional and perhaps play it \"too safe.\"  Happily Acorn is an exception.

I sampled the pork belly and the fiddlehead fern -- both small plates, but the portions are sufficient for a light dinner. The pork belly dish presents a good balance of taste and texture. The date brings out the sweetness; the crunchy pickled veggies serve as a counter point to the luscious fatty meat. The fiddlehead dish is served shakshuka style, in a cast iron pan. It was very satisfying, with the egg yoke still soft and runny, and the salsa verde offering a mild hint of heat; I'm not usually a huge dill fan, but here, the herb is used judiciously and is not overwhelming; it harmonizes the entire dish well. I also tried the shortcake dessert, expecting a conventional mess of strawberries and cream over biscuits. Happily, Acorn offers a more sophisticated rendition, with Italian merengue, goat cheese ice cream, caramelized peaches, and some freeze-dried strawberry accents. It avoids all the usual pitfalls of a bad strawberry shortcake: it is not cloyingly sweet -- there seems to be some salt in either the crushed nuts or in the ice cream (almost a little too much); it is not too dry; and it's not one-dimensional. 

The service was fine. I showed up to dinner alone and without reservation. They seated me right away at a high top by the window; the servers were attentive and did not rush me.

I do think there is a bit of an incongruity about this restaurant --  the vibe of the place is more of a casual bar and grill, like other nearby establishments, but the food and the price is more upscaled. If I just wanted to grab a quick bite to eat while taking a break from shopping, this place would not fit the bill; but then, there are already lots of other outlets for that kind of dining. I'm glad that an inventive restaurant like Acorn has joined the Walnut St. neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went to Acorn for an early lunch. While the waitress was lovely, the host could not be bothered to acknowledge my existence, focused more on setting up the restaurant (which should have been done before the doors opened) than taking care of customers. For lunch, I had their wedding soup, which was fine but nothing special. I might as well have had a Progresso can. It felt like they were banking on their location on Walnut rather than providing an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and appetizers. Great for both! Sat at the bar. Relaxed atmosphere and knowledgeable bar tender. Definitely recommend the squash appetizer!"}
{"text":"We were a little intimidated when we looked at the menu (because we weren't familiar with many of the ingredients described) but decided to take a chance. And we are so glad we did!  The food was so amazing!  Really. Each dish we tried was a great pleasure and surprise. Wish we'd taken pictures. We had the charred cauliflower, goat sausage, spigarello, duck lasagna and carrot cake. Oh my. Like nothing we've ever tasted. This will be our new go to."}
{"text":"Late night apps and drinks at this new, trendy spot on Walnut Street. The decor was clean and light.

RaeLynn is an amazing bartender.  Very friendly and knowledgeable. Our cocktails were well crafted and satisfying. We were not impressed with the Acorn Red Blend. 

The food was presented beautifully and had unique flavors. The Oysters were sitting on a bed of seaweed with hot saltwater poured over the seaweed at the table. It was reminiscent of the Oceanside. The fermented pepper mash gave a spicy kick to the oysters. The Calamaretti was bursting with flavors and I enjoyed the Three Bean dish very much with chili black garlic.

I'm sure we will be back soon to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"I think Acorn is a fantastic addition to Walnut street. We went for a birthday lunch in early March. The atmosphere was calming and the service was fantastic.

My friend's ordered the omelettes and really liked them. I ordered the grilled cheese, but didn't care for it-- all I could taste was thick, American cheese. I noticed this isn't on the menu anymore, so maybe they took it out of rotation. The side salad was simple and delicious. 

This is definitely the place for a nice sit-down lunch. I'd be back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The Duck Lasagna is amazing. It's not so much like a traditional lasagna you would expect, not smothered in red sauce like an Italian restaurant would do. The flavors are bold and delicious. We ate there last night and I would go back today just for this dish. Also had the short ribs and were so so good as well. Finish with the carrot cake. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best new restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is innovative, beautiful and balanced. Every flavor sings. Try the trout or rabbit. DO NOT SKIP DESERT! I cannot speak highly enough of service and creative dishes."}
{"text":"I admit I'm not one for exotic meals but I shouldn't need nearly every menu item explained because I can't tell by the title what the food actually is. This is advertised as an American restaurant but the waiter's first question to me upon learning I'm a meat and potatoes person was \"Do you like curry and Indian food?\" What?!? The bread and butter appetizer and the potatoes dish were good (though that was hardly \"potato salad,\" the description by the waiter.) The monkfish portion certainly fed two. My drink Life is a Peach was bland - no peach flavor at all. The wait staff was attentive so there's a plus. This restaurant is EXTREMELY noisy - so don't expect to hear the person across from you or even the waiter unless you're practically shouting. Most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in - the wooden back is tilted. While they look nice and contemporary, theu tilted wood hits you right in your lower back. It is painful! So to avoid the pain, you have to lean forward the entire meal. Now for the real pain : the bill! This is a VERY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT.  My husband is a foodie and while we will pay good money for good food, this place (given the entire experience) is not worth it. There are many truly awesome restaurants in Pittsburgh that have great innovative food, along with creative staples to suit my palate, that do not leave me walking out in physical and financial discomfort. So... Let the Acorn drop off your list of places to try."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner. Our server/ bartender was amazing & very knowledgeable & helpful with the food & drink selection. We had the ribeye for 2 & it was more than enough & better quality than I've had at other 5 star downtown restaurant . This is exactly what the neighborhood needs. It's amazing cocktails with fresh ingredients with the culinary skills to match! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very excited about a new and fresh restaurant on Walnut Street!

Was hesitant about trying out brunch at Acorn because of their limited menu, but I'm glad I did! The service we received was professional and everyone was very attentive. I was expecting them to have a full espresso bar for brunch, but they do not. 

We tried the Everything Crust - their take on lox and bagels. The homemade bread was warm and delicious!! It was my favorite thing we ordered. Also had the Chilaquies from their before noon section - it was really flavorful and filling. 

Definitely a nicer brunch option in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, easy to talk and be private. The menu is exquisite and filled with so many wonderful flavors. I'd tell you what I ordered but I hear the menu changes week to week. Which makes it interesting to come back all the time. My waiter Luke was spot on and hats off to chef Ben Hoffman and the staff for a phenomenal dinner. A gem in shadyside I cannot wait to frequent again"}
{"text":"I would give Acorn a 4-star for the food but the overall experience in terms of price/value, noise and comfort reduces my rating.

Wine prices by the glass are high (low teens) but that has become a trend here.  But it was the price of the wine bottles that seemed more inflated with very few priced at under $50!

As others have noted, this is a pricey restaurant and the portion size in many cases (particularly the appetizers) was small.  For a party of 3, we ordered two appetizers:  the charred cauliflower ($14) and the root vegetables ($11).  The cauliflower was very tasty, the root vegetable dish was served at room temperature and was just OK.  Both dishes where on the tiny side given the price.  We each had our own entree:  Mushroom Rigatoni ($26), Arctic char ($33), and Rainbow Trout ($28).  The trout dish was a decent size and very good, the Char was undercooked and had a strong mustard sauce as well as raw onions, the pasta dish was certainly tasty but again small in portion with no other sides.   By the end of the meal, I was still moderately hungry.  Given the high price of desserts, we opted to go across the street for gelato instead.

The noise level in terms of music was high and distracting, particularly since the restaurant was not overly crowded on a Tuesday night.  Others have complained about the chairs but were not an issue for me. 

Service was good but not great given the price point of this restaurant.  

The menu is an interesting one though and for those willing/able to spend over $50 per person, it's certainly worth trying."}
{"text":"Came here with family the day after Thanksgiving.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, the veal sausage and squash appetizers were great.  Also, the trout and lamb entrees were great.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Do not miss this place!  The food is amazing. Much of the menu \"sounds\" a bit strange but it's truly wonderful food. We had the squash, Brussels sprout tarting and gnocchi...every bite was delicious.  They also have hand crafted cocktails that are seasonal. Service is smart, professional and very knowledgeable. Cozy warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so awesome! I can't say enough about it. The decor is clean and modern and the food is excellent. I highly recommend the cauliflower appetizer and the duck lasagna. This was a very reasonably priced restaurant for the quality of food. They have my strong recommendation."}
{"text":"So this was my first time at Acorn and I really just wanted something cool to drink. But I wasn't prepared for the level of personal attention I got. The staff was awesome! I got a handmade cocktail with jalepenos watermelon mintband cilantro with mint. Added mezcal it was So good! Had the marinated Tomatoes and was surprised again! Fresh interesting flavor profile. It's hard to find something new to improve on a tomato salad but they did it. Chatted with the bartender for a while and she was knowledgeable and a great guide to local spirits. I will be back again. Great surprise find in shady side"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here. My friend knows the chef so our table had some perks, but I could tell that the food at all the other tables was also top notch. Everything was fantastic, including the service. This place was probably top 5 meals I've had in my life. Highly recommend the beet salad and the carrot cake. We had a nice variety of other dishes and I think you can't go wrong with the menu!"}
{"text":"In town for work. Asked the hotel if they had any recommendations for dinner and they recommended Walnut Street for dining and shopping. I went on Yelp and found this gem. The decor is modern and sleek - very classy, warm, and welcoming. The menu is amazing and so different. I got the \"Down the Rabbit Hole\" cocktail - reposado, horchata, and cardamom. I love trying new tequila drinks so I was very pleased. The waitress was so sweet and knowledgeable and recommended so many things I decided to try a few small plates to get to try several things. I tried the salt cod, chestnut ravioli, and veal sausage. After the salt cod, I was satisfied and could have had only that for my meal, but I'm glad I tried so many delicious things. Based on these, I'm sure the whole menu is incredible and if back in the area I would absolutely come back. The waitress told me this place is only about three months old, so I want to highly recommend it and I hope this restaurant is vey successful! I also overheard the bartender tell some diners that their charcuterie is cured in house which is also awesome. 

I only have two suggestions - first, I was looking for an early dinner and one of the tipping points for my choosing to come here was that they opened (according to yelp) at 4:30 PM. When hotel shuttle dropped me off, I noticed they don't open til 5. It's snowing out so I had to wander around for a half hour. Luckily, there's lots of shops in the area. And it was WELL worth the wait. But that should be noted.

My second suggestion is to add a larger sign. The shuttle and I were looking for it and it was difficult to find. This storefront is not well labeled (neither the address number nor the name) unless you are walking right up to it. Other than these two items, it was a flawless experience. The staff was friendly and welcoming and all the other customers seemed to have incredible experiences as well."}
{"text":"Our experience at Acorn was overall very positive! I ordered a Pimms Perfect Summer cocktail to start off and it was the perfect amount of sweetness while being refreshing. We started with the Oysters as our appetizers and boy they were delicious, slightly spicy and full of savory umami (plus points for the presentation, it's pretty cool how the steam comes out of the seaweed). We ordered the Lamb and the Rigatoni and we were impressed by both. The lamb was tender and cooked perfectly. The Rigatoni had home made pasta and had a pickle like flavor which was refreshing and interesting.  We ended with the Lemon desert, and the ice cream was creamy and the pound cake was warm and flavorful. There was no dish where we felt like it was out of place or mediocre. Everything was so good!"}
{"text":"Amazing! First of all the service was amazing. We wanted a slow, relaxing meal and the waiter, shawn, totally picked that up and respected that and was knowledgeable and attentive but not overbearing. We did a cocktail, bottle of wine, and small plates and it was so good. The food was unique and clever. Rich but not overly filling or dense. The octopus was the best we've had in Pittsburgh. Pricey but definitely worth it."}
