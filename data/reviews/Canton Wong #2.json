{"text":"The first time I tried this establishment, I thought it was decent food and they delivered.  2nd time ordered take out.  lady on phone said it would be 20 mins for the food to be ready for pickup.  got their waited additional 30mins.  almost left when i walked in.  the place looks dirty.  took food anyways.  was immediately disappointed.  food looked gross and not prepared properly.  still ate some and it did not taste right.  will look for another place that will deliver in future."}
{"text":"I noticed that a couple of people had left some pretty rough reviews and I had to leave one to set the record straight. This place is great. I have been eating here for 6 years and the only complaint that I have ever had was a waiter that was rude. He was handled very quickly and is no longer there. The existing staff is very friendly and personable. The food is excellent... the best fast Chinese that I have had in Phoenix. The menu is full of choices and they have something for everyone. Everything is cooked to order and piping hot when you get it. The decor is nothing to write about but hey... its a cheap Chinese restaurant in an old building in an older part of town. They must be doing something right because they have been there for a long time and they are not short on faithful return customers.   I'm fairly certain that those who didn't like it were expecting to have a gourmet meal in a fancy setting and it is simply not that type of place. Spend some more money if you want fancy people!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here because it was late, I was tired and hungry and every place in the neighborhood was about to close. All I wanted was some middling Chinese take-out to go home and throw in my face. Canton Wong #2 looked like just the ticket. Small, empty, typically mediocre looking place. The AC wasn't working so it was stifling hot in there. I almost turned and walked out.   I'm so glad I didn't! I ordered the Chicken with Vegetables and the Vegetable Soup. (I always like to try a few dishes my first time in a place - to have leftovers and to get a broader sampling of the place's fare.) When I got the food home, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of both dishes! The chicken entree was brimming with vegetables of all kinds, all cooked to the perfect consistency, not mushy not underdone. The chicken was flavorful and tender. There wasn't the over-saucing one finds with many average Chinese places. The serving was more than ample, especially for the reasonable price. The soup was as well-prepared as the chicken - a generous variety of still-somewhat-crisp vegetables resting in a light, nicely balanced broth. Not greasy or overly salted, just clean and fresh tasting.   I will definitely revisit Canton Wong #2 next time I'm in the mood for BETTER than middling Chinese. I'm not sure I'd dine in - frankly the atmosphere is a bit dreary. They haven't spent a lot of time, money or attention on the decor.  But for take-out, this is one of the better experiences I've had with Chinese food in the Valley.  Give 'em a try! I guess they also deliver."}
{"text":"The lady who took my order was not just quiet but a bit difficult to understand. Maybe just raising her voice would have helped. She was very nice in explaining the menu, but I had to lean over the counter to catch the words she pretty much whispered.  What I ordered: Twice Fried Shrimp with Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Soup.  Twice Fried Shrimp - the sauce was good, but I had ended up scraping off the batter from the shrmip. Dipping the shrimp into the sauce, making it a whole lot better. The fried rice was good, typical of any fast food chinese place.  Sweet and Sour Soup - it looked like brown gelatin. Gross. I took one bite and thought, no it couldn't taste that bad. So I took a second bite, yup - it is bad. It had a strange after taste.  Soda - I saw the fountain drink station so I ordered a soda. Well, needless to say she proceeded to pull a 2 liter from a refrigerator and poured my drink from that into a to go cup.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've had, period. I placed an order for delivery: cashew chicken with white rice, fried wontons, and egg drop soup. The whole order cost around $13 with free delivery. The lady on the phone was nice and the delivery guy seemed alright, too.  Once I received my food, I was severely disappointed. It was greasy and most of the food was cold. I started with the wontons, which had zero filling and the accompanying sauce had the consistency of jelly. So I put that aside for the egg drop soup. The soup was yellow, thick, and cold. It pretty much looked like they just whisked a bunch of egg yolks and called it a day. I hoped the chicken entree was at least partially decent, but I was again disappointed. The chicken AND the cashews were soggy (how does one make soggy cashews? I've never encountered this before), while the rice that came with it was cold and hard. Ugh, everything was thrown out and I ended up eating a peanut butter sandwich for dinner."}
