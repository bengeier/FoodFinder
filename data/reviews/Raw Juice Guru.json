{"text":"Disclaimer: this is going to be a little cliché. 

After a month of gluttony and decadence, I welcomed the new year with open arms and embraced the North American way of shedding that hideous holiday weight; juicing. 

The program is completely customizable, which helpful, since we all have different goals, metabolisms and dietary restrictions. You'll have a phone consultation with a representative and then you'll fill out an online questionnaire and be on your way to achieving your goals :) 

What I liked best about this juicing program is that the vegetables actually come from their own farms. The juices are made fresh for your order and dropped off discreetly in the middle of the night by your door. Per day, you get 8 juices/elixirs. Some of them get redundant, but for the most part they taste pretty good and keep you from being hungry (so long as you follow their instructions and consume one every 90 minutes). 

The first day was okay, I wasn't hungry but definitely missed chewing real food. The second day was the hardest for me; I was wondering if I'd wake up and catch myself eating my pillow. The next few days were easier and at times I felt like I understood why that guy from Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead did this for 60 days. After a modest 5 days, I was totally rejuvenated. I didn't need an alarm clock to wake up, my skin was luminous, I had an abundance of energy all day long and I didn't experience bloating after meals. 

Would I do their 10 day program? Probably not. But I would certainly recommend this cleanse for starter level juicers!"}
{"text":"I had a major communication issue with the company while ordering food and juice for delivery. I filled out a questionnaire regarding what I eat, and so I thought they would work with that. If they couldn't they should have just stated it upfront instead of sending just raw veggies wrapped loosely in lettuce and chard -- no paté, dressing, \"cheese\", sun-dried tomato, nori, dressing or even lemon juice ...  or anything but 2.5 cups of plain, raw veg + 2 juices for $79.

I was fully refunded (well, I'm actually waiting for it to appear on my MC), but for the inordinate amount of work I put in answering questions, filling up forms, talking to the chat guy and calling the company, it was hugely disappointing.

Maybe the food is good, idk? I would just order right off the menu otherwise you may get what I did. They also could not tell me ahead of time what I was being sent, so it was very challenging. I would've loved to give suggestions; oh, actually I did, but they were disregarded and I was told they were afraid to give me something I couldn't eat, even though we had just discussed dressings on the side the day prior. So they sent plain shredded veg, which I have plenty of in my fridge. I was also supposed to get everything at once, but I only got half (which obviously left me starving at about 150 calories worth of veg). 

The system is too complicated, and the font too small and website in general very confusing. Customer service was good though -- pending the refund shows up soon. 

The food presentation was also awful -- if you're going to make wraps, make them tight, not so everything pours out as soon as you lift on up.

Too complicated a system to give it another go as it is presently."}
{"text":"I'd rate this place zero stars if I could.

The worst customer service experience I have ever had! First, they are supposed to drop off your crate in the early hours of the morning... I got an email early saying it was delivered. I go to the back door, which is where I requested it to be dropped off (as I live in a basement apartment), not there... I check at the front, not there. I'm now thinking someone stole the crates. So I email and I call... finally this guy responds to my email and says they haven't been delivered yet, but on the way. Well why on earth did they email me in the first place to say it was delivered??? 

My fiancé had ordered his crate as well, and he was about to leave for work with no juice... But finally it was delivered, with not even an apology. Nothing!

Also... I noticed they didn't include one of the juices I asked for. So I emailed again to make mention of it... because, to be honest, I can do green juice, but not 5 bottles of it (which is why I asked for this other one, so that it would break up the day)... all i got was, \"we're out of cane juice so we couldn't make it\". Again... no apology. Nothing! 

I'm not at all impressed with this company. I usually go with a different juice company, and thought I'd try something different to compare. What a mistake! At least the other company apologizes if they make a mistake. Never again!"}
