{"text":"Price to food value is excellent

Very hard to find places still offering full size dinner meal for under $7

The food is tasty, but I'll have to say Babu is still better in both price and taste, but Babu branches are too far away.

The thing I like the most about Silver Spoon is their service speed.
It's WOW! not even Mcdonald can match their speed.

You practically order your meal, and it's ready immediately in a sec, faster than you can pull out the wallet to pay for the take out.

I totally recommend this place if you're in a rush.

Oh and this is during lunch with many people lined up before me.

Been here many times,  and they don't disappoint speed wise."}

{"text":"Not good! no way near Pakistani taste. Ate Bagharay Baingun, it was way too sour."}
{"text":"Not the greatest food in town but excellent value for money. Service is fast most of the time but they are short staffed (help wanted sign on window). I like their kabab rolls, biryani and samosas plus sometimes grab whatever is fresh coming out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"I used to be regular customer and I have started to notice how rude the customer service is. They don't care about no one and today is my last day to drop by this place. Very poor customer service and they even say No sometimes or serve you the way they like and you either take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Good food to be had when your family's not in town, it's not expensive at all and has over all half decent food, not really a restaurant but a take out and if you go there do order their biryani, it speaks for itself."}
{"text":"A true Desi hub which brings both flavors of Indian and Pakistani curries together. Impressed with the speedy service with the take out and the food was freshly made.

$40 worth of food was good enough for 4 people and we still had left overs. The food still taste grate the next day."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, however I had one bad experience out of 4 times. I got rashes all over my body after eating chicken biryani and chicken curry. Not sure if biryani or chicken curry was stale."}
{"text":"This place is always so painful to visit.  There's mass confusion, poor service and mixed up orders.  Calling ahead so your food will be ready when you get there doesn't work either.  I usually overlook this when going to any Pakistani \"dhaba\" type places but today was just more than I have patience for. 

Called ahead for 4 nashtas, am told it's ready so no need to call ahead, I insist on it  telling her it always takes 20 minutes to wait for the puris so she agrees to have my order ready.  I also request that the puris be made dry and not fried, she says not possible (though other places accommodate the request for those of us who don't care for greasy fried bread).  So I request two naan on the side.  I get there 30 minutes later and am told they CAN make the puris dry (great!) so I cancel the naans.  My order is now prepared (I guess calling ahead was useless).  I am handed my order 10 minutes later and there's a package of OPENED uncooked frozen puris (Crispy brand) in the bag. I mean really?  If I wanted to make store bought puris at home, I would just do that.  Besides don't they make their own puris from scratch??!  I ask the lady what that's all about, she tells me that's the unfried puris I asked for.  People intervene, usual confusion unfolds and the package of frozen puris are taken back into the kitchen.  10 more minutes later, same woman reemerges with warm puris in foil.   Not wanted to hang around this place anymore, I  head home to feed the troops.  As suspected, they were soggy and dripping in oil.  *sigh* 

So in the end, spent the usual half hour in mass confusion trying to pick up food which ended up not being what I wanted, as usual."}
{"text":"Had their chicken biryani last night, it was very fresh and tasty. I could still smell the aroma of the food inside the car today morning while driving to work. The portion of meat given with respect to rice was just enough.  I would recommend their biryani to all the biryani lovers out there it's a must if you are in the area."}

i like the lamb curry
i like the beef samosa

{"text":"Holy schnit! I just had one of the best dishes of the year and I won't be able to have it again for a long time, if ever.

Kat F. and I made the trek out to Roncesvalle before Silver Spoon served their last meal on January 22. We met up with SS regular Martin S. and his lovely lady friend. Martin said, \"Get the duck\" and even though I've never met him before, I've read enough of his reviews to know that he does not fuck around when it comes to food.

The dish is juniper berry infused crispy duck confit with a lychee and blueberry jus and organic vegetable and potato hash ($24). The duck leg had been rendered so luscious it almost quivered while the fatty skin on top had been seared crisp. I took one bite and declared, \"I want to make love to this duck.\" Okay, in retrospect, I realize that's silly. The duck was dead and I'm not into bestiality or necrophilia. But I stand by my initial impulse; I wanted to give that duck as much pleasure as it gave me. 

The vegetables were nothing to sneer at either: purple and yellow baby carrots, little potatoes, and other seasonal vegetables were soaking up the savory jus the way Tila Tequila soaked up her 15-minutes of fame. A glass of '05 McManis zinfandel ($12) was a juicy, bold match for the unctuous duck.

After hearing reports that Silver Spoon has the best flourless chocolate cake in the world, we had to try it.  The cake is served warm and blanketed in creme anglaise and chocolate sauce ($8). The chocolate flavor is intense and rich without being overly sweet. Just one spoonful was enough to make me swoon.

Yeah, we had some missteps with the amuse-bouche and vinaigrette that was curiously missing from our Soiled Reputation greens salad but factor in the amazing service, reasonable price point given the high quality of ingredients, and unpretentious neighborhood-bistro vibe, and of course, confit so good it makes you want to *bleep* a duck...well, I'll round up my 4.5-star rating to 5.

I'm sad Silver Spoon has shut its doors for good but I'm glad to have snuck in at the 11th hour. I hope the team lands somewhere else and resurrects that confit dish so that I'm not entirely consumed by duck lust."}
{"text":"Great indo-pak food options. The chicken lollipops and fried fish seem to be very popular based on how often they have to get refilled. We generally go for the chicken biryani, goat curry, and chicken lollipop when entertaining guests, and they clean their plates. Looking forward to trying other options from their menu."}
{"text":"Just had their halwa-puri breakfast - tasted pretty good: not too spicy, decent flavour, well-priced ($20 for 3 breakfast meals, 3 tiny samosas and 2 shammi kebab). Only problem was that it was supposed to come with channa, which apparently they ran out of at 11:30 on a Sunday morning. Their other fried items looked good but will try them at some other time, the butter chicken did not have much chicken, and the karhai chicken looked to be all sauce, very little chicken. Can't expect too much as their prices are pretty reasonable. Heard good things about their catering from other friends, will update when try them. Overall, good prices, decent food, poor customer service (really unfriendly staff) but ok when you need a desi-food fix."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, they never answer the phone. Except their Biryani everything sucks. They still survive because of Biryani"}
{"text":"Best desi food place in the city. Amazing service n' tasty food, everything is always fresh and delicious. Meat is very well seasoned and cooked. Biryani is very good as well. And the serving portion sizes are generous. Service is always on time"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go .... The dishes are nice and have a good taste .... Samosas are also nice and crispy"}
{"text":"The best branch that is good in so far SS is that of scarborough and this one is just ok
I usually take their beef samosas which are good but sometimes there is too much oil in them"}
{"text":"It's lunch time and all you have is $7 bucks and you're starving - do you go to Mcdonalds and get a Kid's meal (since a Big Mac meal is like $7.50 and we're too broke for that today) OR come here for a lunch special.  For just under $7 bucks, you can have a take out order of your choice of rice and 2 curry dishes.

I'm a huge fan of Butter chicken - it's really the only thing I've tried so I guess I'm biased, but I choose this for both of my curry dishes and it's soooo good. 

This place isn't huge, but they do have quite a selection. I'm not sure how fresh everything is, considering I'm usually the only one here when I'm grabbing my lunch, but it tastes good over all. There aren't any chairs to sit down so it is a definite take out place. Service is friendly - but as long as they give me my food and don't mess up my change, I'm usually always happy with the service

Good, cheap place to grab some grub and get rolling back to work"}

{"text":"Horrible place! The service is terrible and the servers are very rude. The food is always overly salted and the meat is over cooked and chewy. 

Don't waste your money on this restaurant."}
{"text":"This business strictly caters towards individuals that follow the muslim religion as they strictly serve halal meat - I went in and asked for non-halal options and they rudely said no and to go somewhere else.

If they wanted to cater to ppl of all faiths/beliefs they should serve both halal and non-halal options.

They obviously dont want the non-halal meat eating demographic."}
{"text":"I had ordered a Biryani tray which is enough for 10-12 people. The biryani was good without a doubt. It is spicy, so if you cannot handle spicy then make sure you ask them not to make it spicy. 

I had also packed few different veg dishes because after 8pm they give the large plate for 3.99$ instead of 5.99$. I ordered Channa Masala, Palak Paneer and Muttor. I regret to say that only Palak Paneer was good. I have had better Channa Masala and Muttor. 

I wouldn't recommend ordering Channa Masala and Muttor. 

If you want to enjoy the dinner or lunch then Chicken Biryani is a good choice."}
{"text":"Awesome place for take out.  Combo comes with rice and any two items.  This place is very authentic and tastes excellent.  Anyone looking for cheap great food, this is an ideal choice."}
{"text":"Tried their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Both of them were not that great. The curry flavours were horrible. Never again!

And to top that, the naans were not cooked properly (cold and chewy) and the rice was not warmed up. 

Paid $20+ for all of the mentioned above. I'd all be worth it if the curries tasted good though, but unfortunately not. 

The rest of you might not agree with me, but I'd ask for a curry sample before I buy if I were you. 

The staff is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Toronto I had the great fortune to live above this restaurant for a couple of years. My mother helped me move in and she offered to take me out to dinner before heading out, and we decided to try the restaurant downstairs. From the first taste of the first apps I knew that this was going to be a serious problem for my budget. Over the six or so times I have been to this restaurant since I have had maybe two dishes that haven't been perfect, and several that have been more so (echoing a recent Tstar review that referred to a jump in quality as making the place 'perfecter'). 
The service is, first of all, beyond impeccable. The waiting staff is exactly the type of informed polite service you see in cinematic representations of classy dining but never seems to quite materialize off-screen. If one wishes to engage them in conversation about the items or ask recommendations (they have an excellent sommelier) they are warm, friendly and knowledgeable, but if you are there, say, on a date and simply wish to eat great food and interact with your significant or hopefully-soon-to-be-significant other, they without fail will fade into the background and quietly perform their duties. This sense of how to act and when, is one definition of perfect service. It is not a constant, but a mutable reaction to the nuances of every dining situation and every server I have ever had here is a paragon of this quality.
The food, as mentioned, is across the board great, although I certainly recommend Duck here, a specialty no matter how it is prepared (a roommate of mine told me in all seriousness that one of the duck dishes here actually made him tear up because it was so good. I haven't quite had that reaction, but honestly, the duck is fucking wonderful). All of the meat dishes are great, the pasta is always very very good, although, as I've said elsewhere, I have yet to have a truly GREAT pasta dish in this city, here is very close to the best. Appetizers are often my favorite part of the meal, and one of the best meals I've had here was one where I just decided to order three seafood apps and no main: fucking fantastic, and something I've done since here and elsewhere, why not!

Last, and far from least: That first night I ate here with my mother, we had finished our meals and she was inquiring as to the deserts: 

My Mom: \"So, we are thinking about some of these, hmm...flourless chocolate cake, interesting, what is that like here, is it good?\"

Waiter: (completely straight faced) \"It's the best chocolate cake in the world.\"

Lesson: trust your waiter."}
{"text":"I went with some of my friends. The interior is actually just a small place but it's nice. I liked the chicken biryani although I wanted the goat biryani but they ran out at the time. We asked for spicy and it was kind of spicy so that's good. I do like their naan, but the chicken tikka masala we ordered was not spicy at all even though we requested it to be spicy. But I was hungry so I ate it without complaints. I think I would come again for the goat biryani next time, but I would be fine with the chicken biryani since now I know it's good.

I've been here multiple times since I wrote the paragraph above. They just never, ever have goat biyani, ever. Because every time I ask if there are any goat biryani, they say no. But still, I enjoy their chicken biryani and naan. Their butter chicken was unfortunately not good. But biryani and naan are worth coming back for."}
{"text":"***I was first to review this place.  I gave it 5 stars and below review remains.  I do feel it has fallen off big time.    

I have given you so many chances, your staff is very nice.

My last straw was the cockroach on the fridge.   I called the guy out from the back to show the  cockroach.  It was about mid adult size, with them wirey attennas.   It was crawling around, and i pictured it being baked into my shami kabab I just ordered.  

The food is on warmers.  It is either doused in oil to not get dry... Or it is Dry.

I have a sense of humour, and i literally have to never go back there ever again after posting this.  Otherwise I will get curry cockroach to go!

Fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This my friends is a king of takeout Pakistani food. I have taken out a lot of stuff and have gotten them to cater for big parties in my house where I have to feed 30 people or more. 

Price is competitive, Service level tends to be fast but the volume of people is usually high.

Food wise I will give them 3/5 as most their food dishes meets the average standard. Their catering food is decent as well but their Tandoori Chicken pieces are hit and a miss.

{"text":"Oh, Silver Spoon. I've tried to love you. I've given you so many chances. 

But this just isn't working out anymore.

To start: the food isn't exactly terrible. It's just...not very good. I've tried almost every meat dish, the chana masala, samosas, biriyanis, etc. Indian take-out is hardly known for its healthiness, but when you order a veal karahi and get two sad chunks of meat floating in half a container in oil, it's a little disheartening. Add to that the fact that food is often sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long...

On the upside: the chicken biriyani is good bang for your buck - especially during the week when it's on special. You get a fairly flavourful container packed with rice and meat. It's ready to go, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for your order. There was that one time they ran out of chicken biriyani (which is understandable when it's on special) but then offered me a \"regular biriyani\" (read: JUST rice) for the same price. Ummm, say what?

I do love their beef samosas - it's just to bad that they NEVER HAVE ANY. Seriously, I have been here early in the evening, at random times during the week, and they have loads of sad looking veggie samosas, but no beef. I feel like the owners need to do a serious evaluation of what works and doesn't work. If you notice you're always selling out of a certain item (and NOT another), doesn't it make sense to up that portion while downsizing another? Who knows.

My biggest gripe was the chana masala incident.
The last time I went in, I ordered a chana masala (which I'm apathetic about, but my husband likes). The girl at the counter kind of made a face and said, \"Oh...no. You don't want that.\" I was confused. There was a whole tray of it there, brimming with chick-pea goodness. \"It's not...good today.\" 

What? What does that mean? Is the taste just 'off' or had it spoiled? In either event, why is there a full tray of \"not good\" chana masala here for customers to look at (and possible walk out the door with)? I stared at the tray, and she motioned at it again, \"I was just going to remove it from here anyway.\"

But, um, you didn't. And I was the only person in the store. From the wide glass window, before I even stepped in, I could see that there was no one else even there. She hadn't even come over until I'd been standing there for a few minutes. 

It really bothers me that I still really don't know what was so wrong with an entire tray of food that it would warrant being thrown out - and why it HADN'T been thrown out immediately if it really couldn't be saved. It was clear from the crispiness on the top (you know, that kind of layer of 'skin' that develops?) that it had been sitting for a while. Ultimately, I'm really quite relieved the staff person told me before I bought it, took it home and got diarrhea or something (this would be a much harsher review if that had happened...) And I guess that says something positive about the customer service (sorta...)

As more and more Indian food places - both takeout and dine-in - emerge in the region, store owners need to realize that customers are going to eventually become more discerning. I really wanted this place to be a favorite - after all, it's very convenient for me - but, sorry, Silver Spoon, you just don't make the cut."}
{"text":"Good variety of Indian and Pakistani dishes. The relatively dry dishes, kebabs, tikkas, wings, fish seem to be better options and are good. Takeout only."}
{"text":"In general, food is just ok. A lot of confusion from staff in regards to order, I have often gotten the wrong order. Last night, I ordered a kabob roll, although they got the order right this time, I found myself taking a huge bite of aluminium foil along with my meal. They had rolled aluminium foil INTO my roll. I had to take the roll apart and, take out all the foil then reassemble it. It was pretty inconvenient and extremely messy. On top of that, they didn't give any tissues!! Overall, this place started off really well and their food used to be really good too, but recently I find that the quality of their food and service is just poor."}

Staff are ok and the place is clean and off course they are investing so it's better then any other take out i have been. Other item like fish and chicken are good and I think the food is acceptable to eat here . They should make more (veal) biryani over the week"}
{"text":"Not very friendly service, they don't speak or understand English very well. Food was very oily and  not very tasty. I asked for raita about ten times and was assured five times it would be in there then it wasn't. If you're looking for a decent meal is drive right by this place"}
{"text":"The chicken biryani is good. Make sure to let them know how spicy you need it to be..

Unfortunately they don't have lamb Biryani.."}
{"text":"They do not have lots of crowd and it taste is different than other locations. I would not say the food is completely bad but certainly not the best. Their biryani, the holy grail of southeast Asian food, is just so spicy and sometimes taste raw, like something is missing. I would suggest this to masses, try before you buy."}
{"text":"Had the worst possible experience with their catering service today. The order was for a lunch party of 60 people in Toronto.

1. Dishonesty: They committed to sending the delivery out of their location at 12pm and when i called them on the delivery day they confirmed that the delivery person has left at 12. The delivery person reached the location at 2:00pm and he said that he was not asked to leave until 12:50pm

2. Incompetency: They left out one of the key items that we had ordered. Of the items ordered, the karahi chicken was the most important. However, instead of Karahi chicken we got an extra tray of rice!

The guests had to contend with the remaining items which ran out quickly as the karahi chicken was not available. It was incredibly embarrassing for me and my entire family as hosts.

AVOID using Silver Spoon for any of your catering needs."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Take out only though and the service is a little slow and haphazard. We were there on a busy night and the staff couldn't figure out who was next in line; they should look into a numbering system. The butter chicken and channa masala were very flavorful, but the naan was just OK."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed with the fish and nihari I bought today. Nihari was full of salt and it clearly showed it was old .. fish was as if you are chewing on a over cooked beef .. despite that basa when cooked is all flaky, but their fish was leather .. once again nihari was a sad experience. Ran off to food basic after that to get their oven baked chicken to it. A big thank you to silver spoon for disgusting our dinner."}
{"text":"A casual Pakistani eatery with authentic taste n spices. This place is always jammed so be prepared to wait a while before seated. But it's all worth it. I've tried different dishes here and not been disappointed. Price wise, so inexpensive and portions here very generous. If you're craving for spicy Southeastern Asian food, this's the place.
Enjoy"}
{"text":"The call came out early this week: little poland area reviews anyone? Thus our dynamic duo set out in search of a nice place to dine on the Roncevalles strip and the Silver Spoon heeded the call with flair and excellence!

Situated on the tail end of strip, the Silver Spoon is rather unassuming on the outside-you could miss it easily what with the summer construction and it's rather plain exterior. However, once inside and seated the real theatrics begin, on with the show as they say! 

To start with, the service is exemplary here. They certainly know how to anticipate desires and meet them with grace and expertise. The wait staff are neither grovelling or arrogant, rather they are well honed pros who know how to please and serve. Questions are addressed with patience and knowledge-Christine and I must have put them through the paces with queries about wine, produce and meat! And the little touches from the amuse bouche, table crumbing and well timed drink service were well appreciated acts. 

Now the kitchen certainly didn't shirk away from putting forth a fantastic meal as both our appetizers and mains for the night were well prepared and delicious. We started off with a berkshire pulled pork atop a panko crusted polenta cake. The pork was extremely tender and moist and the crusted polenta melted in your mouth. The other starter a smoked trout served with wild rice pancake and salad was a knockout. This dish had a variety of flavours to enjoy: smokey, sweet and savoury! 

For the mains, I decided upon the steak frites- a nicely seasoned cut of beef that was tender like buttah. And the accompanying frites were golden and crispy. Christine's selection of duck confit matched her expectations and more: the skin was almost shatteringly crisp and the sweet pool of sauce paired well with the salt inherrant in a confit. Underneath the duck confit was nature's bounty from the season's produce: purple carrots, radish and green's. 

We were over the hill when the decision time for dessert came though we decided to plow through and ordered the stuffed french toast. This was a extraordinary dessert-you had a stuffed brioche full of goat cheese, a carmelized citrus sugar top with a bailey's dulce de leche ice cream on the side. Wowzers, this was yummy and different. As if that wasn't enough of a sweet ending, the kitchen staff left us with Callebaut cookies as a parting gift. How sweet!

It should be noted that Silver Spoon shares the same food philosophy as Union-a previously reviewed restaurant. Both express a commitment to local organic ingredients in a bistro/fine dining environment. Although the Silver Spoon is not located on trendy Ossington or Queen West, I feel that it executes a notch above the Union's and Nota Bene's of the dining scene. In short, it may fly under the radar a bit, but it delivers soundly in terms of flavour and service. Give it a try for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Nice place for cheap take out. Very good serving size.
Food is very spicy..tasty, definitely not bland...but definitely hot
Chicken biryani has authentic taste, but not a lot of chicken
Butter chicken is tasty, spicy, creamy, chicken cooked well, but a little too much ketchup.
naan is also good
if you go for dinner, be ready to wait."}
{"text":"Biryani was amazing! I've had good biryanis here in Toronto but this one takes the cake for sure! Best biryanis, not too overly spicy, not too much masala, not too little masala, not too much kewra, just the perfect biryani!! The fried fish was great and the chicken malai boti was amazing as well! Would definitely come back here with friends and family and would get catering done once again! If looking for amazing Pakistani food, then this is the place to go! Yummy and delicious and right here in the heart of the suburbs in Mississauga. The karhai chicken was good too but the biryanis was the bit hit of the evening by far! Will come back from far just for th biryani. We had chicken biryani but they have any type that you would like, including veal, beef, fish, and chicken."}
{"text":"I've really tried to like this place but it disappoints me more and more each time I visit. 

At first, the portions were generous and the food was delicious. Today was the last time I'll be visiting, though. It was the third time I was given three small bits of butter chicken in a combo when previous visits I was given two heaping scoops. When my husband and I pointed it out to the server and asked for an actual serving, she spooned three more pieces in but then disappeared into the back with the container. She reemerged a minute or so later and told us she had to check if it was ok. I get it if we were asking for a huge amount but we were not. Just the same amount given to us when asking for the vegetable curry. The thing that bugs me the most is that I have no clue what actually happened to my container when it was taken out of my sight. 

Won't be returning."}

{"text":"Didn't know of this place until a family friend advise they're having a get together here.
In the never ending busy plaza, Warden in between 401 and Ellesmere, Silver Spoon is serving up some great Indian, Pakistani dishes.  Its portions and reasonable price (average $7.50)  makes this place popular with the locals, with line ups to dine-in or take-out its always busy!  
Dining in, there's limited seating so do get here before peak lunch or dinner time or you'll be waiting for a while. 
Among the list of dishes, overall in terms of quality and portion its an easy 4/5. 
Veal biriyani
Chicken biriyani
Chicken korma
Lamb curry
Naan

To top if off, the service was great too."}
{"text":"It is with great sadness that I am reporting that my most beloved Silver Spoon will be closing their doors after 10 years on the beleaguered Roncesvalles. We dined there on new year's eve and they told us then. The construction that was never ending reduced business by over 40% and it was a tough decision on their part. 

I'd like to wish Rocco Agostino the best and thank him for his fantastic cooking. I'm not quite sure where I'm gonna find my crispy duck now. :( 

Just an FYI....Rocco is also the owner of Pizza Libretto. I'm hopeful that he will open up another spot similar to Silver Spoon. It was a special spot and it'll be missed. 

Silver Spoon RIP. We loved you."}

The chicken Marsala and butter chicken was surprisingly a letdown as they are usually staples of South Asian cuisine. The prices for the food was also good as a huge plate of biryani was only $6.99 and could probably be split between 3 people - talk about value!"}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani.....EXCELLENT!!!!
4 stars only because they run out by 9:15pm....and 4 times outta 5 they don't answer their phone, otherwise, it's a fantastic dish!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats! Delicious fish and alright biryani makes this place a worthwhile stop on a weeknight. It might not be a quick stop though, this place is usually bumpin' on Tuesdays when their biryani is only 3.99, so be prepared to wait in line a bit.

PRO TIP: They DO take cards! Only Debit though."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pakistani/Indian restaurant. Decor was decent and service was fairly good. Place gets very busy, so allow some time before you get seated. 

We ordered the following:
1. Butter Chicken: 9/10 AMAZING. It was one of the best butter chicken dishes I've ever had. The only drawback is portioning. It came in a small curry bowl. Not worth the price, but very flavourful! 

2. Chicken Biriyani: 9/10. We ordered spicy, which was a good spice for a brown person lol. The green yogurt was good to balance the spiciness of the dish. Portioning was on point; pretty big plate. Enough to feed 2-3 people. Felt like the taste was average in comparison to other places.

3. Tandoori Naan: 5/10. Was expecting some in-house made naan, except these were just warmed up and served. 

Overall, I would definitely come back here again. Service was good & food was flavourful!"}
{"text":"We decided to get take-out from this restaurant after reading positive reviews on Google. We called the order in and that went fine, except some of the items on menu weren't available. They advertise that they serve halal Pakistani, Indian, Chinese and Hakka Cuisine. When we got there they were a bit disorganized, the food was in containers but not packed up. It took a while to finally check-out but we paid $71 for dinner for 6 people. The girl at the cash was also very helpful when it came to answers about soy and gluten content in the food. They threw in some extra sauce and salad which is was great. Everything was very tasty but very spicy, even the butter chicken and palak paneer. It was near non-edible for me - I can't really do spice though - so I had to drown everything in plain yogurt. There was some face wiping and sniffling around the table, especially by those who ate the veal biryani, but everybody enjoyed the meal. We also had plenty leftover. So while definitely good be warned that everything is very hot."}

See Bilal's review. His ratings are pretty bang on for this place. 

And here's a brief overview: 
- their dry chicken dishes are pretty good. (I like the Tandoori and Achari chicken)
- their Biriyani is pretty up there in terms of quality.
- Silver Spoon doesn't have the best butter chicken. In fact, it's spicy. When is butter chicken ever spicy?!

Silver Spoon isn't an eat-in restaurant. It's a takeout and catering joint. 
The Mississauga location runs out of food in the evening. Any later than 9pm and it's probably all gone. They've run out of biriyani by 5pm on weekends. Clearly, they need to scope out their business better. 

Verdict? I'll keep coming back - it's my only option for a biriyani fix in my area."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Scarborough, I decided to try this place as I have a palate  for spicy food

We ordered chicken biryani, Nihari and the lentil concoction called Haleem with Nan bread. The bread was the freshest, crispiest, and tastiest thing I've ever eaten that is made of wheat. The service was fast and courteous food was tasty but a little too greasy for my liking. The place is not the cleanest and for some reason majority of people there for males each one giving me the look.

 The portions are extremely generous and more than half the food that I ordered was packed in containers to go home. I will attempt to remove the extra oil, and eat at home, in peace without men staring at me"}
{"text":"I ordered 30 Naan from this restaurant and they gave me burned naans along with stones sticking to it. Really disgusting and I hope authorities take action against these folks who can't maintain quality of their food."}
{"text":"Rude man taking orders, rolled my eyes at me a couple of times because I was unsure what to order and could not understand him. I love south Asian food, but I don't know all their names. If you decide to go, park far away from everyone else because the patrons will dent your car door. Never again."}
{"text":"I visited this place to pick up some Tandoori food. To my surprise they were out of most of the food and unwilling to make anymore, this posed to be slightly odd because it wasn't near closing time. 

Anyways, the service isn't the greatest here, most of the employees are very cold and lack any sort of customer service. The woman serving me got mad when I told her she put more Chicken Tikka then I had asked for (you pay by weight) which was kind of strange since it was her mistake. They are just interested in getting you in and out as fast as possible. This was a huge turn off for me as I have received impeccable service from other South Asian restaurants.

The food wasn't very good (I ordered Chicken Tikka and Chicken Biryani). The Chicken Tikka was very dry and lacked flavour, it tasted as if it wasn't marinated; just had the spices thrown on and went into the Tandoor. The Chicken Biryani was the worst I've ever had, the rice was WAY too oily and had little to no masala. Once again the chicken lacked any flavour, it was almost as if the chicken was cooked separately and thrown in with the rice.

Do keep in mind that ALL of the food is kept ready, much like a buffet except you don't serve yourself, so there will be a time when you get \"old\" food. 

Based on my experience, I'd go somewhere else for your South Asian cravings as this place really isn't worth your time or money.

I know this review seems really negative, but it is 100% accurate based on my experience. YMMV."}
{"text":"Great food. Pretty much all dishes are great. Depending on who serves you, you may get more or less pieces of meat in your Biryani - but regardless it will taste good. May be on the oilier side...  Better than Biryani is the veal pulao that is available only on weekends. I continue to takeout from this place regularly.."}
{"text":"For ten dollars I had rice, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, paratha (pardon my spelling if I'm wrong), and a soda.  Affordable, delicious, and quick.  It is take out only, which wasn't a huge problem since I was walking distance from my hotel but it is why I'm only rating 4 stars.  Be prepared for heat, but I was warned by the lovely girl at the counter about the chicken tikka."}
{"text":"Food's good but terribly unprofessional staff. I placed a take out order in person there, along with my girlfriend.We waited thirty minutes just to be asked what our order was again!

Staff didn't apologize and made us seem like as if we had done something wrong instead. We felt terribly disrespected, even though we patiently waited and politely asked about the delay. 

I wouldn't suggest the place for dining out as the ambience and staff isn't up to a good standard.

However, if you want a good South Asian take out in the area. Great choice!"}
{"text":"This place is ideal for days, you simply want to take out good, fast, and already made food. They have a wide variety of Indian dishes consisting of chicken, beef, goat, fish and vegetarian. I especially like their Biryani (chicken and rice) special. 

Its delicious food at a good price. The food is laid out like a buffet for you to see, and you simply ask the server for the dishes you want. Personally I like taking out the meat dishes from here and eating with rice or rotis that I already have at home. 

My favourite dishes are Achari chicken, the goat, the fish pakoras and the biryani. The place is well maintained and clean making it more appealing."}
{"text":"Food isn't all that great and didn't get my order correctly.   Not going there again."}
{"text":"This place is consistent on being inconsistent in their food taste. The only thing that I can order and be sure its going to be good are the seekh kababs and reshmi kababs...which we often get. The service is really inefficient so just bite your tongue and hold in the frustration while you are ordering. Tip: always request extra green chutney!!!"}
{"text":"The reason for my visit?  $3.99 Chicken Biryani Tuesdays!  How can you beat that??

I knew there was going to be a problem when I saw the door wide open.  Keep in mind that it was like 35C yesterday.  So either AC was broken or owners were too cheap to turn it on!  No fans either, so I felt really bad for the people working there, especially in the back cooking.  Canadian Tire/Home Depot are your neighbours, why don't you just buy some fans and write them off as a business expense?  Owners, this is not a good look!

Aside from that, there was still a line-up of post-9-5ers coming in to grab some grub for their hungry families.  

A female customer ahead of me what telling worker which pieces of mutton to grab - without the bone.  (Makes sense, as you don't really want a container full of bone + sauce for dinner.)  She was being soo demanding, yet the worker didn't flinch one bit.  That was pretty impressive as I would've exploding, especially with the heat!

I got a Chicken Biryani to-go ($3.99, maybe 2-3 pieces of chicken, pretty good flavour - can't complain for price) & a Matar Paneer ($5.99 for a large, not enough paneer, mostly peas & gravy).  

Perhaps I should've taken note from that demanding customer and directed the worker to scoop up more pieces of paneer!  Whatever the case maybe, both dishes were more than acceptable to me.

Along with the questionable management (re:  no-AC), the food handling is somewhat suspect as well.  Containers upon containers of ready-prepped Chicken Biryani may be alright, but I didn't see the raita (yogurt based) being pulled out of a fridge or anything.  No-AC, along with leaving food out can be a barf-y mix!"}
{"text":"I am utterly disappointed in the service at Silver Spoon in Brampton. I had called in around 12:30 to place a big order and repeatedly told them the time it would be picked up by (a good 3 hours to prepare). When my husband went in around 3:45, the food wasn't ready and it was as if the order had never been placed. Then, instead of getting the order ready, they tried to figure out amongst themselves who had taken the order.

Their food is good but this experience has really put me off!"}
{"text":"I called the resto to do a pick up order so I could have it ready and bagged by the time I got there, but the lady declined my request so I assume they dont do call ahead pick up orders. 

Anyway, I got to Silver Spoon and it started to get quite busy after I came which was just before dinner.(5pm)
I ordered combo #3 for $7.99 which includes biryani rice, and two diff curry meats (I opted for two butter chickens instead). The lady at the counter was ok.. she was a little rude, and not attentive. I asked for two orders of naan and she came back with one. She kept saying I only asked for one and never told her two but I did. This kind of frusterated me. Lol

Portions are large. Foods pretty good. Butter chicken was spicy, but still tolerable considering I normally dont do spicy. Definitely a good price

I would recommend coming on Friday because they give two naans for free if you purchase any large Curry meat dish. 

Would come back again..when Im not in a rush (slow service)."}
{"text":"We were initially introduced to the food from Silver Spoon from a group lunch event at work.  We have been regulars ever since.  It is a takeout restaurant with a great selection of hot foods from their display window. So no waiting.  Everything is fresh and has an authentic home made flavour. The rice is long grain and light. The chicken pieces are tasty. The sauces are rich and tasty.  We have always found the staff friendly and helpful and willing to explain the various dishes.  When you get into your car with your food, the smells are so delicious you cannot be sure you can get home without trying some. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chicken biryani and butter chicken. authentic Pakistani/indian taste. Takeout only but great taste. Never disappoint."}
{"text":"The food is alright, not that great. Chicken briyani is very dry. Just went there once."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I went there with my boyfriend one late evening.  The place was packed and a pretty long lone for take out, so clearly this place had potential.  As we placed our take out order we noticed the server roll his eyes at us a few times for no apparent reason.  After waiting a long time for our order, we followed up only to find that our order never made it to the kitchen.  We eventually got our food, but did not receive any sort of apology.  The food was delicous, however it's just too bad they don't show appreciation to all their customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really really bad customer service and the food is pretty much just the same. The chicken is dry on the inside and the enormous amounts of steam in the restaurant from the heated food table causes all the skin to become soft. While we were there the phone was ringing and the staff answer the phone while in the middle of an interaction with another customer, I thought this was an anomaly but this happened three or four times during the same interaction.
Usually if the food is good I really don't care for customer service however both proved to be less than average. I would never go back and don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a bang for your buck but only for selective items. I have tried almost everything on the menu from dry meat to rice to curries. Hence I have some items that I always go back to get! 
My go to item is chicken biryani which ranges from mild, regular or spicy. I always get regular since my family does not eat spicy food (shocking I know for a brown person)! This is 6$ and can feed 2 to 3 people for sure. Included in the rice is a piece of chicken which has a mild flavour of spices. The kabab roll is another item that I get which has salad, kabab, mayo and is wrapped in a naan. The naan is a bit chewy to eat but overall the flavour of the roll is good.
The curries are full of oil and contain too much masala so after trying several of them I would not recommend them to anyone. The bar bq chicken is over cooked and the meat falls off the bones. For flavour I would give it 2.5 out of 5. To me this tastes more like baked chicken than grilled chicken. The naans if freshly baked are easy to chew and satisfying.
My favourite item from this place is lollipop chicken which is fried and cripy with an amazing marinate. The fish pakoras have way too much batter and are not to my liking.
They also have daily deals which are money saving! This place is always busy and has a huge turnover of food so nothing is ever stale. Now the service is beyond slow. Its only a take out place so the line ups are long. The employees are super slow and take their sweet ass time serving you. For the price, portion size and the biryani I would always go back here!"}
{"text":"I would not touch the veggies. I was advised by the staff to order it well after noon when the food was warmed at the buffet (frozen food?) The tandoori chicken, kebabs etc were just fine but I suspect not-free-from-msg..."}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced and restaurant is decorated well. Had their butter chicken was the worst butter chicken I have had. Restaurant is well arranged staff barely speak English"}
{"text":"Great take out place. They have a huge selection of food. One gets in a dilemma as to what to order. Their food is pretty good. This is a great stop when nothing is cooked at home. Quick stop and get anything u can think of. I rate it 5 star"}
