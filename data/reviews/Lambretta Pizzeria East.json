{"text":"It was a promising start. Warmly greeted at the door and promptly seated. Our server, who was very pleasant, came over quickly and took our drink order. The lights were way too bright so I asked our helpful server if they could be dimmed a bit. No problem....until they were turned up a minute later by an unpleasant looking woman, who was the owner we found out. She said the lights had to be on FULL as she wanted to create a \"family environment.\" Which, to two gay guys out for dinner, seemed a tad homophobic. Our cue to leave. Every night we drive by the lights are on bright but there's never anyone inside. I guess we weren't the only once who felt unwelcome."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

They have a number of gluten-free dishes on their menu, including gluten-free pasta and pizza. I ordered the Bianca fig pizza, which was delicious. I took some of it home and it tasted decent reheated. The style of the gluten-free crust is thin and crispy. I plan to go back and try some other kinds. The pizza is on the pricier size but the ingredients and combinations are not ordinary so i think it's worth it. The only downside is the gluten-free crust is an extra $3. 

I came here with my family and they were very accommodating for babies and kids. The front entrance has steps though so if you have a stroller you'll have to carry it in or use the side entrance. 

Bonus: they have a patio 

TL;dr they have lots of gf options"}
{"text":"We went back to Lambretta a couple of weeks after the first visit, and although it was good, we had a bit of a disappointing experience. We ordered the Fig pizza again that I raved about last time, but unfortunately, they were out of figs. The woman working that day suggested that they substitute figs with apples instead. We agreed to try it and although it was good, we were charged for the same price as the fig pizza! We didn't ASK for the apple substitute, they had run out of figs! Being that the fig pizza is the most expensive pizza on the menu, I would have assumed that she wouldn't have charged the same price for an apple pizza as a fig pizza. But nope - she did, and because we don't like to cause a fuss, we paid full price. We were so excited about this place, but now we'll think twice before going back."}
{"text":"Have been to Lambretta twice and am really pleased to see this new addition to the neighbourhood! As you walk in, there is a welcoming environment from the very first interaction.  I have been in twice with kids and this place is definitely child-friendly! We were treated so well, with lots of understanding for our rowdy children - who were given crayons and paper as well as a fantastic kids menu. I judge a pizza place by the ever-important crust - and this one is amazing. In addition -great sauce and interesting toppings. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful new neighborhood Italian spot!  The food was excellent, the service was attentive and the vibe was charming.  We'd highly recommend it for a cozy and comfortable trattoria meal..."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent! It was family (kid) friendly. I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night, was looking for a nice, comforting cheesy dinner and that's exactly what we got.
We ordered the cheese and meat platter, consisting of asiago (yum), brie, parm, prosciutto, salami, devoured almost the whole plate before our entrees came. Went down nicely with a glass of Chardonnay.
The truffle rotini is to-die, although heavy on cheese, the dish itself is far from heavy, had a nice breaded crumb topping over the pasta. My BF had the shrimp scampi and gave it a 10/10.
The staff were super nice and welcoming. Excited to come back!!"}
{"text":"The storefront on the corner of Queen and Curzon is kinda like a slot machine.   Every few months new signs go up, staff names change, cuisine gets reinvented and furniture gets remodernized.   

One month it's tapas gastropub, the next it's hipster lobsterfest.  You never really know what you're going to get.   

But it was time for the machine to pay out.   And finally we've earned back our communal quarter. 

Lambretta is exactly what the neighbourhood needed.   A well-done, casual but classy spot for an easy night out.   

An awesome assortment of pizzas.  Chili oil infused with rosemary.  Killer craft beer on tap.    We couldn't have been happier with our experience.    We had a pizza with honey and figs. 

So we'll be back through these doors.   And finally the name on the sign should stay the same.

Recommended."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place. It was two of us for dinner, and we ordered a pasta, pizza, and the arancini to start. When we cut into the arancini, it was frozen inside. No prob, we told our server and he suggested that we picked something else to start. So we did (I forgot what we got instead) and the rest of the items came and were fine and tasty. We even ordered a dessert. When the bill came, the server said that he \"left the arancini on the bill, don't worry about it\" implying that the replacement cost more and he'd let go those uh, two dollars? Whaaaaaat? You gave us undercooked food!!! 
We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"When you see all the pictures on Instagram you get all excited because it looks so delicious. I guess it's never judge a book by its cover. The food it self was mediocre, the prices were okay. Just when I ordered the food based on the photos I had seen I expected it to look the same when when it comes to the table. This was not the case.

The server was pleasant if he came around, I did feel rather bad for him as he was the only one there and it was kinda busy. Overall, just a meh."}
