{"text":"Lovely cafe to hang out in the village. I had breakfast sandwich (poached eggs, Montreal smoked meat, cheese and the usual fixings) and a coffee. The service was friendly and so were the patrons. But then again, it's Montreal, isn't everyone warm here? :)"}
{"text":"Coffee is good, food is delicious, and the staff are super nice. To top it off, they have fast WiFi and tons of table room with lots of wall outlets nearby so it's a great place to work."}
