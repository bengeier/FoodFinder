{"text":"Pho Quynh is a brand new restaurant with a great variety of Authentic Vietnamese dishes!! They have Bun Rieu which is rare in a typical Vietnamese restaurant around the Charlotte area, but it was delicious!!! This place is worth a try!!"}
{"text":"For Charlotte, this is really great pho soup. It is the only thing I have had here. I believe it is the best in the city iv had so far. I believe it will be my go-to place for Pho. I give it 5 stars for the flavor of beef, the smoothness of the beef broth and the whole flavor of the Pho Duc Beit. The ambiance is calming and the service is pretty good too. 
I would recommend you try the Pho. Another new and great spot for Charlottes food seen."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Vu runs the place and he is very attentive. My friend and I had phó with rare beef. The broth is perfectly balanced and meat perfectly sliced. Highly recommend the avocado boba tea and the Vietnamese coffee is authentic. I've been to Vietnam."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for a conference, and since the conference didn't have any real food in the evenings, we decided to go sample some of the local places instead.

One of our cravings was to get some good Vietnamese food. I did a quick search and found a number of places, and we settled on Pho Quynh. It is a nice little place with a good number of tables close to the windows so that you can see out. We were seated and served some water while we perused the menu.

Of course we had to go with our old stand-by of getting some summer rolls. We were not disappointed, and since we had indicated that we were going to share the dish, our waiter split the two rolls onto two different plates for us. Very nice service there!

We then received our bowls of pho. I ordered the medium, which I am glad I did... I am sure I would not have been able to eat the large this time around, and frankly I combined some of mine with the leftovers of my mom's small for a nice lunch the following day.

The pho itself was good, but a bit sweet. I really had to hammer mine with chili paste to get it to where I love it, because the sweetness of the broth was countering the chili. 

If we get back into Charlotte again, Pho Quynh is certainly a place we would go back to!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Impressed. Every Vietnamese Pho place I eat at are usually not too good, except one. This place is really good. A far ride for me but definitely worth the trip. My other favorite now has competition. lol. I had shrimp pork rolls and Seafood Pho. Both were very flavorful and were very reasonably priced. I definitely have a new place to go to."}
{"text":"Great customer service (especially the kitchen lady - very generous when I asked her for chili) and food tasted great too!  I really recommend this place.

Pho broth is legit! Bought one large Pho to go for the wife and she was amazed.  This is definitely our new place for Pho, however, I really want to try other Vietnamese dishes - they all sound delicious and I know y'all won't let us down! Keep up the quality ingredients guys. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"After a cross country trip from Las Vegas with my boyfriend, we were soo ready for a home cooked meal. We were yelping Vietnamese Restaurants around our area and Pho Quynh popped up. We did take-out and I got the bún riêu cua, and it definitely hit the spot! Love, love the huge chunks of crab meat. For sure we'll be back, and dine-in next time."}
{"text":"This place is honestly my favorite vietnamese place to eat at. There food is well seasoned and their hospitality is amazing. My favorite item is their pho, the broth is outstanding!! I would 100% recommend to anyone who is looking a nice authentic vietnamese meal! :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful Place, The service is PERFECT. The waiter are funny too!! Love it, gotta come back every time i go eat."}
{"text":"My tastebuds are scorched, but it was worth it! This was my first trip to Pho Quynh and I'll be back.  I've been fighting a cold for about a week and a buddy took pity on me and brought me here. The beef combination was \"phonomenal\" (te he he he). The large was more than I could eat in one sitting. The garnishments (basil, sprouts, lime wedges) added a unique flair to an already incredible delicious bowl of flavor. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Incredible!! My entire experience from the wonderful smell, the clean and beautify decorated atmosphere, super friendly staff, and amazing food, is just Incredible.  Even my wife and 2 picky kids LOVED it!  Our 1st Vietnamese restraunt.  Thank you for the experience!"}
{"text":"I just happened across this place in the middle of the afternoon. I ordered the pho combo. I'm a pho neophyte so I began by trying the broth which was rich and delicious. Then I asked for some guidance from my server about adding condiments (hot sauces, hoisin). She demonstrated how to make one dipping sauce for the meat and flavoring for the broth. The meat absolutely came to life. The broth, already delicious, took on a whole new layer of complexity. What a find!"}
{"text":"pho quynh is a wonderful place for authentic vietnamese cuisine. all the foods are delicious. my favorites are : special beef noodle soup ( pho ) , rice / egg noodle soup , beef stew , spicy beef noodle soup ( bún bò hue ) and chicken curry . you have to try them . it's a number one restaurant for vietnamese noodle soup  in north carolina."}
{"text":"I love pho and on an especially nasty, cold day, that was what I was craving.   Living in Plaza Midwood, there are many options for Vietnamese food.  I have been to all of them.  This is by far the best I have been to.   I had the egg noodle wonton pho.  Some new and interesting ingredients that other Vietnamese restaurants don't include like bok choy and something pork tasting that was crunchy.   More affordable and better than Lang Van and others. Nice and clean too.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had in the US! Their broth is incredible. Havent tried to have anything but beef Pho but their broth has a depth to the flavor that no other place in Charlotte can beat!! Good hours too, open until 10pm as opposed to some that close at 9. This is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems you'll never want to give up."}
{"text":"Review is for PHO only. 

In my opinion the best place to enjoy pho in Charlotte- hands down. The broth is tasty, meat is plentiful and wait staff is attentive yet chill.

If your down with hole in the wall (yummy) food, this is your spot! Im looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu and updating my review."}
{"text":"Really good pho and really awesome service! Got a small and still couldn't finish it!"}
{"text":"The grilled pork rolls were massive and quite delicious, made of pork sausage that resembled kielbasa wrapped in rice paper with lettuce and cucumber. I chose the Bun Rieu as opposed to pho and it was fantastic. The broth had a nice, mild crab flavor without being too overpowering. The ground pork meatballs were home made and the fish cake was cut thin enough to allow it to soak in the broth. Fried tofu pieces had a nice crunch and added to the dish nicely. If the quality of the food I was served is any indication, I can only assume the pho is great and I will be back very soon to find out."}
{"text":"The best pho I have ever had. Definitely will go back again. Our server was so sweet and the environment was super homey. A nice authentic spot"}
{"text":"GO HERE NOT PHO AN HOA! This is truly the best pho in Charlotte.  The broth is incredibly flavorful and much better than their busy neighbor."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pho. Not an expert by any means, but it was definitely the best I have ever tried. Huge portions for the price too. Pro tip: size down from whatever size you think you need. I could not finish my medium and my boyfriend could not finish his large. We got some pork spring rolls too, meat was a little dry, but other than that tasty! 

It was not crowded while we were there and the only server spent most of the time sitting with another table talking to them instead of waiting on us which was a little irritating, but luckily we weren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not really sure how to pronounce this - let's assume that \"quynh\" is pronounced like \"kin\", and if you say \"pho\" like it should be, which is to say, \"fuh\", then you may not want to ask your mom to come here.

Regardless, it's come a long way since it was Ben Thanh. Not that it has moved or anything, but rather than being ready to be torn down, it has undergone a nice renovation, and actually looks like it is no longer about ready to receive a demolition notice.

Also, there are nice menus, and the staff is really helpful, ready to get you your nice steaming bowl of Pho - or whatever else you should order. The Pho especially is interesting because you get a variety of sizes, which is interesting because usually you get small and large. Here you get small, medium, large and extra large. The medium and large are hefty - no idea how big the extra large is, but you better be ready to consume quite a bit.

Is it the best? Not sure - Ben Thanh is quite good, but a ways away in Matthews, and just next door you still have Pho an Hoa, which is also tasty. But it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Chill little place with easy access and plenty of parking. The food was PHOQUINH great! We both had beef pho, everything delicious. Quick and friendly service. Plenty to take home, too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent pho place in Charlotte, I highly recommend Pho Quynh! After hearing my roommates rave about this place I finally decided to give it a try. I ordered take out and my order was ready in 10 minutes. The restaurant itself is nothing fancy but who cares? The staff was super friendly and the food was FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Had to give my brother a ride to his darts game and my fiancé and I are not exactly bar flies (and we weren't exactly the target clientele). We hadn't eaten dinner and were very hungry. Searched the area for a place to eat and saw that this was in walking distance. Not familiar to the area, we were a little nervous, but anything was better than being stuck in a tiny bar with no food. The atmosphere was a peaceful, clean and welcome change. I ordered the egg noodle wonton soup (pictured) and boy, was it delicious! My only previous experience was soured by a terrible hangover, so I was pleased to have a second chance, and a great one at that. I was getting over a nasty cold so it hit the spot for me. My fiancé got a combination pho bowl and enjoyed it. The bowls were so huge that I wound up taking much of mine home and the leftovers were even better the next day. It really hit the spot! We also got Thai teas to go, another favorite of ours. They were mixed then and there so they were a little warm on top, but the boba was just the right texture and the taste was fine. What could have been a miserable evening turned into quite the treat. It's not super close to home, but we will definitely consider going back when we get another Vietnamese soup craving! So glad we took a chance on this place."}
{"text":"This could be personal preference. Pho is good, but nothing extraordinary. Fried spring roll is below average, or average at best. Fried quail is very gamy. Those items are what I usually order in a Vietnamese restaurant, so Will not return. If you like other dishes on the menu, maybe give it a try, but if you are like me, then I'd say Pho HOA is waaay better for those particular items."}
{"text":"The Crab Asparagus soup is soooo good!!! Sometimes i just start craving it..."}
{"text":"All i can say is you should give them a try. I am so gald that my friend took me  here. I have tried many pho resturant and many lack favor. This will now be my 2nd option to go to for pho.

We came on a Satuday night, and was sad to say that they wasn't that busy. Maybe because they was right beside another pho place.  Well I order Bun Bo Hue, my Husband got the Bo ko( beef stew)  and my friend and her husband got pho and rice plate. We also order appetizers, we both got an order of eggrolls 2 in 1 order, she order summer roll and i order fried quail. The quail had so much flavor and i just wanted more and more. My kids even ate it.

 After getting our appetizers our food came right after, and i can surely tell you that all of those noodles taste really good. The Beef stew had so much favor, the pho broth was excellent you can tell that its home made fresh each day. And my noodle was pack with a lot of flavor.  

Like most small restaurants they dont have fountian drinks, they have can soda or you can get bobba tea.  But all in all give them a try. You will love it."}
