{"text":"The food is made fresh NOT from frozen, so of course it's going to take time plus it's beautiful & yummy for your tummy..The food is authentic in looks, size & flavor..... real Japanese.... to come here is to relax, enjoy and not be in a rush... it's a good thing!!  The staff is always friendly. The women's restroom always clean. This would be an excellent choice for a first date, just because, a bad day recovery..graduation or birthday celebration, to enjoy something warm while the outside is cold! Just can't say enough good about Wasabi.."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure where the other reviewer ate, but my husband and I are big sushi fans and we have found this to be the best and most consistent sushi in the Madison area.  We come back time and again and have never been disappointed.  I would definitely recommend it!  Their special rolls are awesome!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Service was horrible. Took forever to get the check and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"For a (relatively) cheap sushi place, this place was good. I tried the vegetable udon and a few pieces of sushi rolls. For the most part, the sushi itself was just ok. Not bad, but not outstanding. It hit the spot without breaking the budget.  The vegetable udon was good, but I was disappointed in the vegetables that were added. The mushrooms were good, but pretty much the only other veggie in it was cabbage (with maybe one or two slices of onion). I'm not very familiar with Japanese cuisine, and maybe it's supposed to be that way, but I was expecting a lot more different types of vegetables. The noodles and broth, though, were great. Next time I will probably try one of the udon noodle dishes with meat.  I give it 4 stars because I will go back if I'm looking for Japanese food, but if I find another, better cheap sushi place then I might not go back."}
{"text":"I went to Wasabi back in high school. My friends ordered the spicy shirmp and spicy tuna roll among others that I did not try. I was a fan of both the spicy rolls, and I don't normally like sea-life sushi. Since I tried only a very limited number of items from the menu and the service was prompt and the decor was nice I get Wasabi 3 stars. I would have to try more items in the future to fully review Wasabi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. The rice is perfect, all of the components to each roll are spot on. We had the Bucky, Lambeau, SuperCali and spicy tuna rolls and they were all phenomenal. After eating lots of mediocre sushi in this city, its great to have a fully satisfying sushi dinner. Good gyoza, and best miso soup on Madison as well. I definitely don't get here enough, but I'm going to try to change that."}
{"text":"I have been going to Wasabi for 8 years.  Food is always excellent along with great staff."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were relatively small and overpriced. Nothing too special about them either. Very slow service. Just nothing special about the place-- of course, sushi in Madison is pretty tough to come by, so perhaps I just need to lower my expectations."}
{"text":"Wasabi is the place to go for authentic sushi and other dishes (bento boxes, udon, etc). They also have an assortment of \"American\" sushi so it's a good place to bring someone who is a bit leery of eating raw fish. We have eaten there dozens of times and  have never been disappointed. The prices are decent and the service is reasonably quick."}
{"text":"The most authentic Japanese restaurant on state street was far as I know. I went with my friends for my birthday under the recommendation of a friend who's aunt works there in the kitchen. From that moment my roommate at the time who was really picky with Asian food fell in love with the place and would regularly eat there at least once a week (or at least that's what she told me).   I never tried the sushi so I can't judge whether or not they're good but I think their main dishes tastes just like the ones I ate while living in Asia. I mainly go there for their katsu curry. For a while I got sick of eating at Wasabi because my friends want to go eat there so often but it is still one of the first restaurant I recommend to a friend when going out to eat on state street."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant and agreeable sushi lunch here. Service was outstanding and they had some reasonable lunch specials. I'd probably order something different next time as the rock n roll sushi was a little basic. The girl next to me had some sushi that looked outstanding. Overall I was pleased with this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. I have tried the other places. Yeah, Takara looks nice, but their sushi is not memorable. The decor is not amazing at Wasabi, but the sushi is really fine. Their rice is great. The fish is always fresh and carefully presented. Their rolls are VERY tasty. I highly recommend their Kelsey roll. They do things like their asparagus roll with just the right amount of mayo and the asparagus is just tender. That's the thing about this place, they do their sushi in a \"mindful\" way, and it is consistently yummy. The waitstaff is very helpful, and the chefs are friendly.   Oh, and their chicken udon soup is wonderful.   Last but not least, check out their lunch specials, wonderful sushi lunch for about $10-11."}
{"text":"Wasabi has the best sushi in Madison!! I came here again for lunch and had some great new rolls and super fresh salmon!! Madison has seen its share of fly-by-night sushi joints trying to capitalize on student tastes with fancy names and over-priced sushi of unknown vintage, but Wasabi is the real deal!! It is authentic Japanese sushi, fresh and delicious, and prepared with love at this local, family business. Madisonians who know sushi know that Wasabi is the place to get really great sushi at a fair price. Their roll specials are great too!!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a crowded friday night, can't speak for the sushi...because i didnt have any...but boy was their beef udon delicious. The broth is absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"The previous reviews are mixed, and that is where I stand.  Mixed, but pleased.  I've eaten here twice and enjoyed the food and setting.  The fish smells/tastes fresh, and the sushi (nigiri and rolls) are well prepared.  The service is fine, can be a little slow at times, but nothing out of the ordinary.   I think the place probably deserves four stars but two things are keeping me from giving it the extra one.  I've only been twice, so I cannot say for sure what to expect.  More importantly, I find their tamago nigiri almost inedible.  My charming sushi companion and I compared it to a soggy piece of overly sweet french toast, rather than the subtly sweet and slightly moist egg it should be.  I ate mine out of desire not to leave any sushi behind.  I ate hers on a dare, and so she didn't have to finish it.  Have the sake, the maguro, the ika, the tako, everything else was fine.  Avoid the tamago."}
{"text":"Their spicy beef udon is amazing! Their yakisoba is also good but the portion is smaller than I would've liked.  Their food comes out fast and their quality is always consistent. It's a great place for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"The serving is good, but the steak dinner is not that good, also the sauce for the fried squid is strange......."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The tables were less than half full and we sat there for 30 minutes with only water waiting for our orders to be taken. We weren't even acknowledged by the waiter before we just got up and left."}
{"text":"the food ( udon) is generally good. But beware they will charge each person of the group 25 cents ( I think it may be 50 cents) if you want to split the bill without letting you know the overcharge."}
{"text":"The sushi at Wasabi is consistently good.  They have the best spicy tuna roll (the perfect mix of sriracha and mayo - Muramoto's is always too spicy for my taste) and veggie tempura roll (fried sweet potato with a little mayo) in town.  In terms of ordering nigiri or sashimi, the quality of fish is not quite on par with Sushi Muramoto.  Wasabi definitely comes in at a close second for top sushi restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"MY 2nd/3rd time here; Jennie & I had lunch here last Thursday to begin an afternoon of shopping and cascading down State St in the sparse and rare 76 degree weather here in Madison.  As you know, we usually do Takumi near E. Towne but I wanted to shop & I am NOT a mall rat.  Wasabi is small, quaint and the sushi chefs were quite friendly; Jennie ordered the Tempura Udon with I can't remember what roll.  I ordered a California Roll as an appetizer and the Teriyaki chicken (white meat only for an extra $1.50) w/ miso, veggies & white rice.  My chicken was a bit on the dry side; not succulent.  Veggies were crisp, my two (2) glasses of plum  wine were spot on and the soup was hot.  Waitress was pleasant but brought my roll after my main meal - hurumph...  Our total bill came to around $47 & change.  I may return, but maybe just for some rolls.  Pros:  Kick ass plum wine. Cons:  Please have my appetizer come BEFORE my entree, please."}
{"text":"I missed eating sushi in San Francisco and Takara didn't quite cut it for me, so I tried Wasabi.  I have to say that Wasabi's sushi is comparable to what I had back in S.F. -- They have good, fresh sushi there and their California Rolls are pretty addictive. My biggest issueis that the food is pretty pricey (I pay the same price or a less in S.F. and I get extra goodies like free tea and dessert), but otherwise the place is cool.  Definitely worth it when you're not flat out broke and you're looking for something good to eat in Madison."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant!  Consistent tasty sushi and friendly service.  I visited Wasabi about once a week for almost 6 years.  Now that I've moved out of the area, I miss it a ton!  My favorite item was the Kathy Roll; shrimp tempura with avocado and cream cheese, and scallions and unagi sauce over top.  Delicious.  I don't always like cream cheese in maki but this roll I love.  Also really good tuna and yellowtail.  Now my husband and I go out of our way to try to visit Wasabi whenever we're even remotely in the area.  Less \"heavy\" food than Takara (where they go a little too sauce-happy), and more consistent than Ginza.  Prices are much more reasonable than the tasty-but-pricey Restaurant Muramoto.  Keep it up, Wasabi!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe we came on a bad night but that was so not impressive. Some of the worst service I've had in a while. They took forever to take our order in a non crowded restaurant. I barely remember what we got due to starvation messing with my brain that night. However I do remember that we ordered four quail eggs for two people, and they came in one dish. One. Even if that was for one person, four eggs on a little plate? How did you expect us to eat that I wonder. Also the sashimi/nigiri is definitely priced above the quality."}
{"text":"One of my all-time fave meals (I'd pick it for my last week of meals on death row where I'd get to choose ANYthing) is Wasabi's Chicken Udon Noodle Soup.  Seriously fab - yet healthy - comfort food."}
{"text":"Come for the homey Japanese dishes, but pass on the sushi.  Came here for lunch with nothing specific craving. They do have a lunch sushi combination where we chose the California Roll and Veggie Tempura Roll for $9.95. They do also have a lunch menu with bento box and other specials. But we ordered off the regular dinner menu instead and split an order of beef Sukiyaki ($17).  The California roll was not outstanding but satisfied all the prerequisites of your standard California Roll, avocado and cucumber, inside-out roll sprinkled with sesame seeds. The menu said they use real crab, but it was not distinguishable. The veggie tempura roll was a real disappointment. They really do mean the singular item that made up this roll, that's right, we received a deep fried sweet potato roll.. no other vegetables present... just one. And I might have been a fan because I like to eat sweet potato plain, but the sweet potatoes in the roll were cold, I surmise that this was previously prepared or leftover vegetable tempura from the night before.  Moving on, the beef Sukiyaki was the saving grace of our lunch. For $17, leave your portion expectations aside. I guess if they were going for authenticity, the portion and the price tag would match my experiences from Osaka. What we received was a light portion of shirataki noodles, enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage, a couple of shiitake mushrooms, yaki tofu, tender sliced beef rib eye, and carrot for decoration, all served in a cast iron dish. Oh, and a side of rice. What this dish lacks in sheer magnitude, it more than made up for in intricate, comforting flavors dancing in your mouth. All the vegetables (hey look, plural. yay!!) and meat were immersed in the sweet and salty soy sauce based broth. The full bold flavors stuck with each bite. The buttery noodles tang-ed as you delicately gather them onto your chopstick.  As we were eating, there was plenty of food for two of us to share, perhaps looks are deceiving.    I'd definitely come back just to get the Sukiyaki, which in my eye is worth the price tag. I'd happily spend $17 for something I love than $10 for something mediocre.  They have a few tables on the walkway, so when it's a nicer day out I see utilizing this area more.   Note, they do take a two hour break between lunch and dinner service, so check the website or call before stopping over, and they are closed Mondays."}
{"text":"After nearly 10 years without dining here, I was back and was not disappointed. It is still one of my favorite Japanese restaurants, perhaps my favorite in Madison. Great selection of veggie rolls."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings for this restaurant.   The first time I went there the service was terrible, the waitress was more concerned with talking to the cooks than getting my order filled in a timely manner. If they were able more busy at that moment I wouldn't mind as much, but at the time I was the ONLY one there.   The second time, there were two waitresses and a little bit more people, however the girls were still too busy with gossiping in the corner, but they were more effective with the service, I guess it helped I was sitting at the actual sushi bar that time.   The sushi itself is mediocre at best, I just moved to Madison and have a little pet project to try all the sushi restaurants in town to try to find my favorite.   From my experience a Boston Roll consists of shrimp, avocado, and mayo. Their's apparently is just salmon and avocado. The only thing I found close was the Hidden Tiger Roll on their daily special roll that had eel in it. Reading through their menu it all seemed very plain and not following any of the recipe for the \"traditional\" rolls I've seen at other sushi restaurants. Also, the taste of the rolls themselves are rather bland."}
{"text":"worst seaweed ever seen. Worst miso soup ever seen. Bad nigiri and roll. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Very slow - took an hour to get our food Service was just ok and also slow The edamame and sushi was very meh. Granted it's not the most expensive sushi place, but I was disappointed  Visits: 1"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews of this place, I decided to check it out after work with Jason O. for a healthy and fresh Japanese dinner. I am disappointed to report that Wasabi offered sub-par sushi and even worse cooked items.   My judgement of a sushi restaurant's quality of sushi comes in the tasting of two different types of nigiri. The first always being tamago as it is the piece with the lowest payoff for a sushi restaurant (if they take pride in their sushi, they will do the tamago correctly). The second is going to be a well textured, but very delicate cut of fish (on this day it was halibut). The tamago was presented fallen over and was overly sweet with a \"frozen\" taste to it. The halibut was not even prepared correctly, there was no grated yuzu (I may be asking for too much at this point) and no salt on the on the fish (you do not use soy sauce for a fish like halibut). The fish itself did not have a clean flavor and an off-putting texture. Finally, the most unforgiving of sins against sushi that Wasabi commits is their packing of sushi. Sushi rice is not to be packed so tight as you are supposed to dip the sushi FISH SIDE DOWN. I am sorry to say that grocery store sushi is better than the offerings here.   We then had the calamari appetizer. I don't even know where to begin here. Calamari should not be like onion rings (in other words, the batter should not fall off of the squid like an onion ring. Utterly disappointing.   Finally, we ended with the unagi dinner. The fillets of eel were obviously pre-frozen/pre-cooked, drenched in eel sauce, served atop a bed of rice that could feed a family of five, and also contained bones. The side to this dish was not the usual fresh or pickled vegetables that one would find traditionally used to cut the richness of properly prepared unagi, but was instead limp and bitter sauteed cabbage.  All in all, this was a very disappointing meal and I would be embarrassed to serve this food and call it \"Japanese.\" I rarely ever give out 1 star, but usually 1-star reviews go to venues that have rats and cockroaches. I'll just say that this is barely a step above a 1-star venue."}
{"text":"I wish I had better things to say, but this is sadly a joint that should have stayed in my undergraduate days. I wanted to say this is for people on budget BUT, its not that cheap either.  The place is decent, clean and the sushi chef is friendly greeting us when we came in and was leaving.  I would say, I wouldn't eat any raw stuff here, and the cooked dish I got was also so-so. Tonkatsu was dry and batter was not really there. $14.50 instead of the $10 lunch price I get at King Muramoto... nah. not gonna work.  The only saving grace was the hot miso soup on the cold day I visited.   Just not worth the price you pay, and the low traffic in the restaurant on Friday night makes me doubt the freshness of the sashimi and sushi they have."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good japanese food in the heart of downtown Madison on State Street."}
{"text":"The location is great. But the sushi and sashimi is not very fresh. Still looking for a sushi place in Madison."}
{"text":"The chicken hibachi was cooked well and I liked the veggies that came with it.  It didn't have a ton of flavor though.  While the waitress was pleasant, it took forever to get waited on (I think she was the only one).  Once we ordered, our food came quickly."}
{"text":"The best Japanese restaurant in Madison, in my opinion. I have spent many years in Japan and I believe it is the most authentic of the Japanese restaurants around here. I believe a couple of the sushi chefs are actually Japanese as well, which helps the sushi quality tremendously.   The service here has always been great. Much better than the nearby Takara where I feel awkward with the waitresses/waiters.   It's not the cheapest meal option, but there are a lot of things on the menu that really is not expensive at all.   The food is delicious and I always look forward to my visit there. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with Wasabi.  I ordered a Chef's choice combination platter with 3 pieces of sushi, one roll, and 5 pieces of sashimi.  The roll was fine although I could tell the tuna wasn't all that fresh.  Speaking of tuna, that seemed to be what the chef was willing to part with - one piece of sushi was also tuna, and two pieces of sashimi were as well.  I actually love tuna, but this stuff was a bit mushy and pale looking...  I did receive one piece of salmon sashimi that was tasty and fresh, but the other selections were not much to speak of.  As noted in another review, the rice is packed too tightly as well - I don't like that - it makes me feel like someone was fondling my food before serving it up.  Some folks seem to enjoy the atmosphere at Wasabi, but I personally do not.  For lack of better description, I'd say it feels kind of junky, but that's probably fitting for all the East Coast trashies that seem to frequent this joint - I mean who cares, Daddy puts the money in my wallet, and I just spend it.    Anyway, the service is equally unimpressive - we got water right away, but had to wait quite awhile before an opportunity to order...then the soup finally came...and then the main course (which I don't mind waiting for if the end result is satisfying).  Overall, the waitress was unwelcoming, disinterested, and didn't want to serve us - we were real nice to her anyway.  So...sorry for being harsh, but this place is overrated.  I know it's a long standing Madison establishment, but there are several better options in Madison right now.  Wasabi needs to freshen up their everything, or get outta town!"}
{"text":"I've only ate here once my freshman year in 2003...Shortly there afterwards, I stole their Wasabi banner hanging on the railing outside and never have been there since.  Yes, it was planned and no I do not have it anymore."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome sushi. A pretty popular spot on State Street, and I've always had good luck with whatever I've eaten. It's a bit small and a bit crowded, and they can get pretty slow when they're busy, but otherwise awesome."}
{"text":"As a CA native, I was a bit worried about finding good sushi in the Midwest.  The rolls have a good amount of good quality fish and not too much fluff.  Though not quite as good as some of my old haunts in CA, Wasabi is by far my favorite sushi place in WI.  Wasabi is as good or better than anything in town and is very reasonably priced - for the price, a bit better than Muramoto.  Bonus, the veggie udon is wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife was born in the \"Asakusa (???)  district in Tait?, Tokyo, Japan, famous for the Sens?-ji, a Buddhist temple dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon.\" For such an \"Old Tokyo\" woman, only the best would do on her birthday, so I decided to take her to Wasabi - it passed the test with flying colors! Every dish that we ordered met or exceeded out discerning expectations, and the quality of presentation, texture and color of the offerings could not have been better. Friendly and timely service made the chilled Asahi beer go down just right. Madison may not be Los Angeles, New York or Tokyo, but we know sushi - we really do."}
{"text":"An excellent hot spot in Madison for sushi.   It was my first time at Wasabi and i will be back! The quality of the sushi was excellent, great friendly service and comparable prices.  The Philly roll is highly recommended here!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming aspect of the night was the sushi, good but nothing noteworthy. Our waitress carried an air about her as if our presence was an inconvenience. While waiting for our food a table next to us was cleaned with windex, the smell was noxious. In fact the entire waitstaff displayed an overwhelming level of unprofessionalism and spent more time talking amongst themselves than serving customers. The tempura was under seasoned and under cooked. The teriyaki chicken lacked teriyaki. The rest of the food was only sub par. The final nail in the coffin was when our waitress failed to return my friend's credit card, she was too busy talking to be bothered. She had left it for another employee to find and return it. Definitely overpriced. I will never return."}
{"text":"Note this restaurant is on the second floor up the stairs.  If your walking it's easy to miss. While there Try the \"Kathy\" rolls  and also the Combination for 20.00 includes rice, soup and choice of two items such as Ribeye Steak)cooked to order),shrimp & vegetables fried, chicken, even sushi rolls, etc."}
{"text":"I'll title this review \"An Underwhelming, Frustrating Visit to Wasabi\"   I should have known things were doomed from the time we arrived to pick up our food. We completely baffled the three members of the wait staff when we asked to pick up our order. They slowly shuffled receipts, picked up, and set down bags, and eventually asked what we ordered. After a good 5 minutes of watching the three stooges work on running my card, I looked around to see sad looking dinners with empty water and in some cases, no drink and rarely any food. I won't project my experience too much on what I saw, but a glum night in Wasabi seemed apparent.   When I asked the waitress for two cups of soy sauce with our rather large order, she first stuttered my words back to me and then managed to fish another cup out of the drawer - I've never seen a group so baffled by what seemed to be routine tasks.   Happy to have escaped the hell that was Wasabi's checkout counter, I arrived back at my apartment to find that one of our two entrees was completely wrong, and the miso soup didn't even make it in a bag, apparently. A true feat, since we had been asked a short while ago what we had ordered in an attempt to locate our food. The food was unimpressive, lacking flavor and freshness. But there was plenty of soggy tempura to go around - in fact, the food was nearly as disappointing as the service.   Wasabi seems like a rundown restaurant of yesteryear - an experience I hope to also put behind me as quickly as possible. I would say I'm all for second chances, but this one just doesn't make the cut for another round."}
{"text":"Great food love the special rolls. cool location. We have been going there for years with family and friends"}
{"text":"I too missed San Francisco sushi, like another reviewer but I did not have the same experience. I was going to give Wasabi 3 stars but the description \"Meh, I've had better\" is exactly how I feel about this place. I got a bento box and a piece of tuna sashimi. The tuna was a little mushy for my tastes, not quite fresh enough. As far as the bento box went the fish was a little dry and the tempura was not hot enough.   To be fair, the last time I had sushi was at a really great place in SF that is in a totally different price range so I might be a little biased. I'll check out Takumi and hopefully I will get my sushi craving satisfied."}
{"text":"Good service but honestly the smallest sushi portions I have ever had.   Also the prices were a bit high.  I had three very small rolls and a beer and paid $50.     Won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you are going to eat at this place, I would recommend getting a couple of rolls, rather than one of the chef's choice options...you get to pick what you want, and it is actually cheaper.  My friend got twice the food I did for about $6 less.  The sushi is delicious, but service is sub-par at best.  Our waitress was pretty clueless....she boxed up my leftovers, but threw away my ginger and wasabi...come on!  I had to request more and it kind of felt like I did something wrong.  I would definitely choose Takara over this place, but if you want something quick and not quite as classy, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"It's ok, I guess. I've been here couples of times, but nothing ever fascinates me. Standard service, standard food."}
{"text":"They have the generic sushis which I like. I am always a fan of those restaurants that have inari. I believe it's one of my favorites even though it's just rice and tofu. The sweetness of the tofu is just so satisfying !"}
{"text":"First visit was not impressive.  Small portions and high prices, even on the lunch menu.  The specialty roles were sort of creative but not substantial as they are at other sushi joints.  And the 'regular' roles had the circumference of a quarter, like something you'd find in the airport to-go mart.  Taste & freshness were okay, but not enough to bring me back.  And the service could have been more attentive.  We waited 15+ minutes before realizing we could/should pay inside if we so chose."}
{"text":"I've been here about 11 times over the years, and it hasn't changed much. Sushi is good, not exceptional.   Service is adequate.  Drink list is average. Usually a third full, with empty tables. Mostly young student patrons. Because of the State Street location, they still charge as much as Red.  They will be around after closure of Takara and other sushi spots, but I feel kind giving three stars. Simply average, and sushi demands more."}
{"text":"Wasabi is a staple among my group of friends. They have good sushi and some interesting special rolls. All of dishes without noodles are served with soup. The yaki soba never disappoints. Their chicken katsu is good too, but a little expensive. The rest of the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The service isn't excellent, but the food brings me back every time. I especially love their chicken dumplings, sushi, and Udon soup. I definitely recommend it for everyone! However, it is on the small side so its best for small groups and dates."}
{"text":"The sushi here was dece. My friends and I got a huge platter with a bunch of different rolls, and I really don't have much to complain about- everything tasted good and was fresh. I had the Bucky Roll, and can confidently recommend it. However, the service kinda sucks on a Friday night. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in a small, crowded area, and once we sat down, it took about an hour to get our food. The weirdest part was that it seemed like everybody in the whole restaurant (I would say there were about 30 people) arrived between maybe 5:30 and 7, and everyone started getting their food at the same time. Shouldn't the kitchen have a better system to match the ebb and flow of a restaurant scene?! I think they might have been understaffed. Our server was nice enough to make up for the slowness, but it kinda ruined the fun of a meal out since we ended up talking about how hungry we were the whole time! If I were to go back, I'd probably go alone and at an odd hour during the week."}
{"text":"Came here to treat myself after an exam and wanted to have Asian food, but not Dragon I or any of the other downtown Asian food restaurants. I've been to Wasabi once and sort of liked it so I went back.  I think overall the quality is decent. The food itself is somewhat authentic. I tried the Yaki soba (with beef), the Bucky roll, and a small piece of uni. In terms of the sushi, I thought it was pretty good for downtown/state st area. The uni was also good as well. The Yaki soba was excellent, although a little bit on the sweet side. The beef that came with the noodles was very good quality and there was more than I expected. Even so, I wish they would have given more noodles or at least put it in a smaller bowl and priced it as a side. The dish itself came out as half noodles and half decorative vegetable was a little off putting given the fact that it was priced as a 9-10$ entree.  Overall - the assortment of rolls is good. I haven't been here enough to see if they are consistently offered, but props to Wasabi for serving them. For Japanese food, this is as good as it gets on state street (not counting red sushi/ morimoto). In addition, the service is really good and the quaint, peaceful ambience is perfect for a solo diner or friend group."}
{"text":"Wasabi is one of those places you go to when you've got friends you haven't seen in awhile and you want to catch up. It's small, but comfortable and it's got a very pleasant atmosphere.  The food is solid: I've had teriyaki and katsudon here and both are wonderfully cooked. Full of flavor and the textures are fantastic. I've never had any complaints about the food.  But the service, on the otherhand--I have a food allergy to onion, which is very common in many of the dishes. All of the times I've been here, despite my asking to have them removed, I've found onions in my food. Fortunately, I'm not severely allergic so I picked them out, but they didn't know that and if I was, that could've been a problem.  It's a very, very nice place, but I'll only be coming here when I've got others who just won't settle for anything else--not of my own accord."}
{"text":"This place is a very solid 3.5 stars for me. I am rounding up since this isn't an option. First, it is of note that this is on the second floor of the building complex (in case you can't find it!). We came here on a weekday afternoon around 2 P.M. for lunch after having gone too long in Madison without sushi, and were a bit apprehensive to find that the place was completely empty. We were seated immediately and handed menus. We decided on two lunch specials (one bento box of the teriyaki fish and three regular rolls). The bento box comes with a soup beforehand (a choice of Miso or a mushroom based one - the mushroom based one was tasty and had more to it than just broth as some places do). Our lunch came out very quickly. I was initially a little disappointed to see how small the portions of the regular rolls are, but I suppose for $11, you cannot complain at all. The rolls were tried were the salmon, tuna, and scallop. Note that the regular rolls really only have fish inside of them (no cucumber, avocado, etc.). The fish itself tasted fresh even though the rolls were a bit skinny. However, I would say that the seaweed wrapping was a little overpowering/chewy and the rice was very sour due to all the vinegar. However, not having sushi for so long and for the price point, it was decent. The bento box came out to be a kind of surprise. I ordered Bento box combination B and did not realize that the portion of teriyaki fish would be quite so small (it was about two bite's worth of fish in a small corner). The box also came with a cabbage salad, a bit of spinach salad, a croquette, and 4 pieces of California roll. The fish itself was tasty, however, very small portion. The highlight and pleasant surprise was that the California roll had real crab meat inside of it. Props to Wasabi for adding this little touch. The croquette was nice, hot, and crispy, but not something I would usually eat since it's starchy. Overall, we were able to pop in and out for lunch (which is nice since parking costs $ around state street) and it was convenient and fast. Nothing really stands out as particularly amazing, but it's not bad. I'll probably come back if I'm ever craving something like this and am in the area."}
{"text":"This is just standard lunch special sushi. I don't really have any complaints and nothing stand out either. The only big gripe I had was that the piece of fish that came with the bento box was REALLY small. Instead of that being the main dish, it seemed like the big fried croquette was the main dish instead. Definitely would have appreciated an adjustment in sizing.  The sushi is reasonably priced and decently fresh."}
{"text":"The sushi is good, although it is not spectacular.  However, it's the best sushi we've found on state street and the wait staff has been consistently fantastic.  Sushi never seems like a fantastic value, and this is no exception, but at least they're not price-gouging idiots like the soon to be former owners of T Sushi.  I would give it a three and a half stars, but since they're so nice I'll go for four."}
{"text":"Delicious food but terrible service. We waited for ages to place our order, ran out of water, then had to beg to pay the check. Most tables turned over while we waited for everything."}
{"text":"I like coming in for a quick bite here.  The beef soba and the sushi fish of the day are always good and fast.  The soba comes in a large bowl filled with cabbage, meat, onions, soba noodles, and other veggies.  Not super spicy, I will usually add a little chili spice to it; which they bring to the table too.  The hot green tea is very tasty and warms up the body after a cool walk on State Street (it also seems to never stop coming either.)  Typically I usually am in and out within 30-45 minutes.  Ask the sushi chef about the fish of the day, servers don't usually know.  Super Cali roll and spicy hamachi roll (must ask for this special) are super yummy!  Normally busy between 5-7 pm, I go before or after the college kid rush but they are open until 10 pm."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place for relatively a long time, and yesterday I decided to go there again and I can't tell you how speechless I got with its super discounted food quality. Food portion of this place used to be pretty decent for its price, but this time, the salmon and uni sushi that I ordered were like 95% rice and 5% fish. You can literally see the rice through the thin slice of fish on top. And the eel don I got also had just about half the eel than what it used to be. I don't understand why they do this. I mean if it's out of a cost-profit consideration, I wouldn't mind they going up a bit on its price, but cutting down the food quality is just not wise, and not worth it. And btw they should hire one or two more waiters, the service is too slow with just one girl attending."}
{"text":"Wasabi, Madison, WI  I have been to wasabi twice recently to quickly catch up with friends. I usually have the friend choose the location and the first experience was great (rating as a 5) and the second experience was a bit less than great (rating as a 3.5). Now, the food is fabulous every time! My favorite is the Bucky Roll and I highly recommend it. The texture is what gets me with that roll--it is simply sublime with the bit of crunch with the fried crispy goodness they use to top the roll combined with a small bite coming from the red sauce they use to cover it.   The difference between the two experiences comes down to the service. The first time, I remember thinking how awesome it was that I got my food so fast! The second time it was the opposite experience. I think the server forgot we were seated outside and took forever to even ask for drink orders, and forever again to bring those drinks, and forever again to come back and take our order. I would attend Wasabi again, but I would hope they could tighten up their service."}
{"text":"In comparison with Takara, I think this is a better place. (and I'm Japanese, so I think I know what I'm talking about). Their lunch menu runs from $6-$9, so  it's not too bad for students but it's not the dirt cheap option  either. I had a Bento box lunch ($8) which came with very tasty California Roll, also tasty teriyaki snapper, salad and croque that I didn't care to eat, a bowl of rice, and choice of miso soup or sumashi (clear soup).  - Yes, that's a lot of food indeed.   The service was good, too. I was actually impressed by our waitress (not Japanese, not even Asian) handling the questions from my Russian friend very well.   Over all, a positive experience. I'd come here again and try the a la carte sushi."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I moved to Madison five years ago, and I love going here still! I think that, for the price, their sushi and entrees are really well done. I've had many different sushi rolls, any of which I'd recommend.  The yaki soba is a great entree, as well as the udon soups.  Often times, I bring family or friends here for a quick get together, as the service is fast and friendly.  Overall, a fantastic place on my list of go-to restaurants, especially for fresh sushi."}
{"text":"I only go for the sushi, and it is tremendous.  I have been eating at Wasabi for 10 years and still love it.  They have new sushi lunch specials that are incredibly affordable.  The always serve high quality fish.  Totally casual.  Great for lunch, and surprisingly just as good for a date.    If you are trying to impress someone and you want amazing atmosphere and sushi, this is not the place.  If you just want outstanding sushi, reasonably priced and comfortable place, its perfect."}
{"text":"I went once with a friend and have gone back ever since!! I am regular here. I love their soba and udon! Their appatizers aren't worth the money but their entrées are perfect! Helpful staff."}
{"text":"Wasabi... keeps it simple, consistently delivers.  My visits to Wasabi are now easily in the double digits, and I continue to return for their predictably well done food and approachable atmosphere.  As with any sushi restaurant, it's best to go when they are busy so there is more turnover with the fish on hand, but even on those busy weekend nights it is never much more than a 10-15 minute wait a most.  The generally have one 'special' fish on hand, but that's about as fancy as it gets.  I like sitting up at the bar, and asking the very friendly staff what fish is good on that day and asking for anything special Such as my favorite request: switch out the tuna on the Spicy Tuna Roll for hamachi (yellow tail)... oh man, a must have.   The rest of the menu is also decent.  I like the chilled edamame, gyoza, yaki soba, etc., but it's all about the fish, and they do that very well.  Other notes, it's upstairs, so if you're looking for it... look up.  It's on state street, so if the area is busy you may have to walk a bit from where you park, and also during the summer you can sit outside on the 2nd floor balcony for dining.  Good times!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  We had flown into town that day, had a really big lunch and just wanted something light- sushi was the perfect choice.  Very simple interior, but it has the advantage of being on the second floor and above the traffic of state street a little.  The service was fine, nothing to rave about but no real complaints.  And the sushi was OK.  As my girlfriend stated, there was a lot of rice but it could have used some more substance.  I still prefer my regular places back home though!"}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's favorite sushi restaurant in the Madison area to date. My wife lived in Japan in 2 years and so she's a little picky about sushi -- me, I'll eat supermarket sushi without batting an eye but she'll only eat the good stuff.  Me, I know how to recognize the authenticity of a place by its clientele and Wasabi's is telling -- you'll see a lot of Japanese eating there, or at least in the half dozen visits I've made there I have.  Their rolls are always expertly prepared and seasoned, the only thing I've ever eaten here that I did not enjoy was sea urchin and I think that's solely because I discovered, after trying it for the first time, that I genuinely don't like sea urchin (as opposed to it being Wasabi's issue).  Their udon is also amazing -- my wife orders their yakisoba almost every time we come here because she says it is the closest she's had to the real deal in Japan.   For downtown lunches they have bento specials that include soup, rice, a little chicken hibachi, a little sushi (they have different varieties available), and a flavorful salad. It's a great value without leaving you overly full."}
{"text":"Still good after all these years! A friend and I went there this past week, and had Kitsune udon, a sushi assortment, and tea. Marika is a wonderful and attentive server- I always hope she'll take our table. Everything was fresh and delicious, as always. Our appetizers, noodles and sushi were brought out in courses (very nice!), and the tea pot was kept filled. I always feel taken care of when I eat here. :) Arigato gozaimasu!"}
{"text":"My friend said he always gets the udon here, so the last time we went out for lunch, I tried it too ...  Oh wow.  The flavors, the way the veggies were cooked, the noodles ... It was all so good!! I know this is going to be my favorite place all winter because that veggie udon warmed my entire soul. Now only if I could afford to shell out $7.50 every day (and then perhaps thousands for heart surgery later after I eat all that salt?)."}
{"text":"Since there isn't many Japanese restaurants on State Street, Wasabi is considered one of the most go-to Japanese restaurants around the area. With its reasonable price and decent food, I went there often with friends to satisfy our sushi cravings.   However, I wouldn't say it's the BEST sushi in Madison. Other places such as Takara or Ginza of Tokyo are just as good, with decent quality food and good service. The noodle soup at Wasabi taste okay, but are not very authentic, and the sushi are fresh, but not overly impressive.   I do think that Wasabi is comparatively cheaper than other Japanese restaurants in town, and it's a nice place to have a relaxing get together with friends, or by yourself for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Fresh and good flavors. The rice was a little overcooked on one of the rolls, but the tempura was executed well. My only complaint was price for the normal rolls...$$$"}
{"text":"The first time I came here was with my husband over 8 years ago when we were dating.  This was the first place I ever tried sushi and it has been amazing every time since!!  We come here a couple times a year, typically shortly after they open back up for supper.  We only get reversed rolls, we have never ordered anything else off the menu.  We always get 2 orders of the shrimp tempura which is so good!  We only once got something we didn't like and it was because we tried eel for the first time and neither of us like it.  Otherwise we are never disappointed!  Price are decent but their lunch specials on their rolls are excellent!"}
{"text":"The first Japanese restaurant in Madison and still the best even decades later. This is not fusion food. The sushi, bento boxes, and soba are well done.  The place is clean and simply decorated. The staff is friendly and the place has its own charm with items like the Bucky Roll, the secret recipe ginger dressing, and customer photos of special events like birthdays and other celebrations."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Wasabi but when I finally visited I was not impressed. The little restaurant was staffed with only one waiter and possibly a host (I don't really know what she was doing). No one greeted us when we came in, even when the waiter was behind the stand, a foot away from us. We almost left but then got seated so we said screw it. Well they sat us then didn't come by for 10 minutes.. well, they passed us a bunch cuz the place is so small but we weren't acknowledged until I asked \"is someone going to serve us?\". It was clear that everyone else was waiting for SOMETHING as well. We ran the course and ordered. My vegetable udon was very, very good. I'm not sure what the broth was but it was amazing (please please please don't tell me it was beef- I didn't ask :( ). My husband ordered 2 rolls but only got one, he said not to worry about the 2nd but said the first was good. Drinks kind of pricy but not overly expensive. They need more staff, especially at 6pm on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"LOVE their beef udon!  It's the best udon I've ever had at a sushi restaurant.  The broth is spot on- not too salty and not too plain.  My bf and I have made it a tradition to stop in here for some udon and maki rolls whenever we visit Madison.   Ask the waitress to split the udon into 2 bowls for easy sharing.  (Note: they charge $1 for splitting into 2...)"}
