{"text":"Still the best pizza I've found to this date. Nothing compares to Milanos pizza. There entire menu is awesome. Italian hoagie and steak hoagies are the best! The homemade dressing is so good. This place really makes it hard to try and find good pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"One star all the way don't be misled by the name it is nothing like the pizza Milano downtown. Pizza and wings were as dry as the Grand Canyon... hoagie was stacked with lettuce and filled with pour quality steak em meat... delivery time was nice though"}
{"text":"Crap service.walked in and was totally ignored by employee at the cash.walked right out of this shit hole.Hope their  pie is better than there attention to customers."}
{"text":"Just ordered for the first time. Sicilian crust was what imagine packing foam tastes like.  Clearly this was made earlier in the day if not yesterday. The provolone stix were over done. Thought we would do take out after a long day but we ended up tossing $35 and I still had to cook."}
{"text":"Great pizza and hoagies.  The crust has not changed since the 1980's.  The red peppers topping on the pizza is in olive oil and is the best.  Sad they had to change locations."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Good service. Great owner. Would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants pizza."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Best pizza ever!! The pepperoni is so good. I wish I could eat it every day."}
{"text":"I grew up in Etobicoke in the 70s and as a kid I used to love Milano's pizza.   Recently I moved back into the area and immediately ordered pizza from my old favourite.  If anything, it's better than it was back then.  Great crust, delicious, fresh ingredients, reliable delivery, courteous staff.    We have ordered pizza from them several times since our move back to Etobicoke and they have never disappointed.  On one occasion they forgot a portion of our order but were very quick to correct their mistake, and very apologetic."}
{"text":"We went to Milano's Pizza on recommendation of individuals debating the best pizza in the GTA for two years plus on chowhound. We've been trying to find the best places we like to eat in our area...unfortunately yelp is not as popular in T-Dot as it is in San Francisco. Hopefully that will change...soon.   In any case...this pizza's great. Great cheese with a nice thin soft dough... My husband thinks its like Giovanni's in Santa Clara...I find Giovanni's sauce to be too sweet. Milano's sauce is not sweet and not too flavorful...and for those that like flavor adding oregano on top does the trick. I can't complain. Their cheese I think may be the best I've ever tasted on a pizza - and they give plenty of it....  The owners are real nice too and we chatted away with one of them while eating our pizza there. Many regulars there and the fun part is that they throw the pizza in front of you - how fun! I wish I had my camera on me!!   The seating is limited and they do deliver! We'll be definitely going there again :)"}
{"text":"Love it! In addition to being great pizza- I had a wonderful experience picking up the pizza. The owner was in a made me feel very welcome. It was a treat to order great pizza from a true local shop!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place based on better-than-average reviews.  We had two different kinds of pizza and a pound of wings, and although it was good, definitely nothing special.. and we found the price pretty steep for what it was."}
{"text":"Tried many pizza places in the west end. Good quality sauce and toppings. Perfectly cooked crust delivered on time and pipping hot. If I can't make it to Bitondo's this will be my new west end place"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery - they said 45 - 60 minutes - 2 hours later we called and we get some excuse that the drivers car was broken but it was on it way with a new driver. Called Domino's - not the greatest pizza but at least it shows up in a half hour.   After several calls and excuses pizza finally shows up 3 hours late. And way after domino's.    They did comp the food - but it was middle of the road."}
{"text":"First time ordering called in for pick up. I was told pizza and wings would be ready in 20 mins , so I show up just before the 20 and pizza was done but wings came out two minutes later. I was happy they are punctual, I ordered at dinner time and there were 3 guys busy hustling pizza dough! One lady at back chopping toppings. Pizza tasted great , perfect crust and sauce not salty so we didn't feel bloated and thirsty.  Wings were huge and tasty.  My 4&6 yr old boys liked it. I liked it and most importantly, my wife was happy.  I will order again."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Etobicoke and the wings are pretty damn good too. It's the only pizza place I order from."}
{"text":"Great \"mom and pop\" pizza place. Basic pizza with fresh quality ingredients. Not gourmet but still very tasty."}
{"text":"Milano's Pizza has been serving some of the best za's Etobicoke has to offer for decades.  If you are lucky, they will have slices to serve (CALL AHEAD). I suggest the classic pepperoni slice, which comes with the tiny pepperoni's that shrivel up in the oven, and become little grease cups by the end. DELICOUS. Or, I recommend the Milano's Deluxe (pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers). The Deluxe is my go-to pizza when ordering at Milano's by the pie. The quality of ingredients reflects the final product, and the price point at Milano's.   If you want a cheaper pie, head to Il Paesano's. If you want to pay more, for better quality and consistent pizza, try Milano's.   Note: Their chicken wings are jumbo sized and the honey garlic is my fave.  The staff working are nice, and they had some chocolates on the counter for customers to snack on while waiting for their order. The owner was sitting at one of the tables when I last visited and asked how the pizza was. Nice touch :)"}
{"text":"A nice option to have in the area besides typical fast food pizza. The crust is very tasty and the quality of ingredients is great, but I found the sauce to be a bit bland."}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a pizza expert and this is GREAT pizza!  Very consistent. Must-have potato wedges!"}
{"text":"Quality is slipping here people.  From an 8 out of 10, now a 5 out of 10. I think now pizza nova has better pie.  Want a slice? Good luck, it's as if they don't want to sell slices, why?? If you happen to get one, it's dried out pepperoni. If it so hard to bake a cheese, pepperoni and deluxe and have slices ready? They just don't get it.  Staff seems more arrogant, spoiled by success? Do yourself a favor guys, spend 5 minutes in the Vesuvio's take out counter and take it all in.  If you want a quality pie in the area, call Lennys!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I try a new pizza parlour, I stick to a rather purist approach and order either plain cheese or pepperoni only. There is a magical union, a holy trinity that exists between the crust, sauce and cheese of a good pie.  But in the case of Milano's, I'm indeed pleased that I opted for the choice to include 'ronies. They're small, thin, crispy and in my case, so plentiful that they're doubled if not tripled over on every slice! If you're a pepperoni lover, then Milano's is sure to please."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today after reading all these amazing reviews.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni (that's the only pizza they sell by the slice), and it was way overdone, dry as hell, not enough cheese, tiny burnt pepperoni.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star is because I'm guessing MAYBE the fresh whole pizza pies taste ALOT better.  Maybe I was given a really rare bad pizza.  Seriously, it was that bad.  I wouldn't ever think of going back for a slice."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! Nice people. It's my go to pizza place. Highly recommend. Hoagies and other food good too."}
{"text":"New location down the street. I have been going to milanos for years. Great dough..great pizza. chicken salad, veggie subs.. pizza boat with pineapple. Herm makes great food and reasonable prices as well. The new location has a few chairs.. but I am usually a take out person. on a work break. when I call in lit's like talking to family"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for my son and husband last night and I got a anti-pasta salad and wings as well. I love their pizza and I have had it several times but never ordered wings or salad from them before. I have to say, that the salad was awesome. Crisp lettuce with great toppings which I was not expecting. The wings were also very good. I did not have the pizza because I am watching my carbs but the pizza was full of topping and both my husband and son said it was great. I almost never write a review but I felt the need to write this one because I felt Milano's deserved a compliment. Great food we will be ordering again soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in the food business, nationally, and Milano's has, hands down, the BEST Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, grilled and then baked, that I have ever tasted in any restaurant or sampled at a 'food show'.  Milano's wide range of pizzas, made from 'scratch' took me back to Florence, Rome and Venice.  The crust, it's taste and texture, was to die for.   Buon Appetito, Guy ,"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Decent prices.  Sometimes the phone rings forever- but worth the wait.  My favorite is the Hawaiian pizza.  They don't use red sauce on it."}
{"text":"One of these menu's made its way to my room at the Motel 6. I should have just tossed it into the trash, but I couldn't drive anywhere and ordered a Stromboli and a Greek Salad. Now, they say Stromboli on the menu, but this is clearly a calzone I think. Ok, it is in the shape of a calzone, but was missing the Ricotta cheese that is always found in Calzones. I guess its a cross-over thing, but anyway the crust tasted like a Croissant pastry. If they use that for the pizza, then it will be trouble. THe mozzarella cheese was decent inside, but veggies were overcooked and that pastry crust shell was tough to get past. Salad was just regular with feta tossed on top. Move to the next menu if you see this place and $2 delivery charge."}
{"text":"I expect more from a non-chain pizza place.  It was functional pizza with poor service. We live 4 miles away and we were told that we were not in the delivery radius.   Frozen Sicilian crust left me wanting more."}
{"text":"Best hoagies & pizza in Pittsburgh! Their hoagies are flavorful and never greasy. You can tell they spend more to ensure a quality product. The pizza at this place is delicious! They are generous with the toppings and the dough is crispy & chewy,,,perfect recipe! The establishment is spotless,,the staff is friendly and the manager, Michael, is on top of everything. He is a great ambassador for his business and the community. Come in there a few times and they all know you by name! I have been ordering from them exclusively for years and they never disappoint. I only wish they would expand so my friends in the South Hills could enjoy Milano's as well!! Great job!! Keep up the great work! It's refreshing to find a place you can always count on, they become like family! Try this place,,,you'll never buy from anyone else! Kudos to Michael & his crew!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza. Love their food, love the staff...really have nothing bad to say at all.  My family and I usually just get a double cheese party size pizza which comes to about $23 which I think is a great price. I'm not a big fan of wings, etc... so I can't quite comment on how good they are from Milano's, but I'm sure they're awesome.   Will definitely return...over and over :)"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing - definitely one of the best I've ever had and I've ordered it many many times.  I've only had 2 bad experiences - one time the pepperoni tasted \"off\" and another time the dough wasn't fresh and also didn't taste right.  They are pretty expensive so when something doesn't taste right on the pizza it's disappointing...however, I still love them and would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I've heard this is a lot like 'Windsor-style pizza', whatever that means.   The pizza is good and the guys in the store are nice, too. Milano's is no-fuss... call, order your pizza (thin crust is best), it's usually ready in 20 minutes for pick-up, then enjoy. If you're a fan of leftovers it's hit or miss. (I think this is where the thin crust part comes in.) I think it's great the next day, but the hubs does not. Oh well. Milano's has become a part of the regular rotation nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ordered this pizza for a party, we all thought it was average pizza at best on top of their rude customer service. Won't be ordering again. Also, refuse to do business with these jerks, they won't stop sneaking in our gated community and soliciting in a non-solicitation zone. Called and politely asked them to stop soliciting our neighborhood and they refuse to stop. This business will suffer due to bad customer service and a lack of respect for its surrounding community. Lots of better competition to choose from too."}
{"text":"Last night was Ash Wednesday and I was craving a fish sandwich. This place is close to my house and they take Yelp orders so I decided to give it a go. All I ordered was a fish hoagie with a side of ranch and I have to say it was excellent. The fish was really good and the bread was even better. Not sure if they bake it or where they get it but the bread was delicious and so was their homemade ranch. The people working were super friendly despite them being really busy which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order ahead and get an entire pizza and I've never been disappointed! It's delicious! The customer service is fine.. In my experience at least! I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Likely the best pizza in the area.   Nothing compares to Milano.  We always order the party size,  cold Milano pizza the next day is amazing"}
{"text":"Not my style. Under dressed, tomato sauce was a little bland and it's not thin crust (even though I asked for it to be). I can say that a small pizza is about a medium size so if you're riding solo, a small is more than enough."}
{"text":"I Can't say enough about the pizza in the neighbourhood.  But milano's has some really good pizza.  Jose, is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Great pizza. They truly do have a wonderful staff. They moved farther away from me but I will make the trip. Great pizza!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Milanos for the first time ever on a Sunday night. I got the extra large one topping special for $14 that night. It was ready in 20 minutes for pick up. The pizza was hot at pick up. However, the toppings were scarce, the dough was undercooked and thin, and the pizza was so soggy and limp that the cheese and toppings slid right off. It was a greasy mess. The cheese and topping flavor were average, nothing special, nothing stood out.  After reading the other positive reviews I was looking forward to good pizza, but that's not what I got. Hopefully this was an off day for them, but I probably won't order from them for a while. Sorry Milanos."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner last night !   I had their pasta special.. penna pasta , meat balls, marinara sauce,and salad with Italian dressing -- garlic bread, Erin had a calzone..mushroom and provolone /mozzarella cheese .  Colleen had a seafood flatbread shrimp, scallops and crab.   It was a very enjoyable meal .  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"last few visits (and not that late either...). NO slices available.  WEAK.  staff appears lazy, after a couple of rejections I'm done; rather go to il paesano; incredible customer service and superior product/food.  or calibreze; also more people friendly and they have food available!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Awesome place to stop by for a slice of pizza. Lunch special is grrat.  Visiting from DC and loved this place."}
{"text":"Consistently great tasting pizza and wings, you can't go wrong! Love the small pepperonis they use!"}
{"text":"Milanos is pretty good, they have decent sized pizzas and a variety of other food available. However they aren't consistent. I first ordered during the Super Bowl last year and it was amazing and the staff was very friendly but the next few times I went the pizza would be mediocre or amazing. It's hit or miss but it's still better than some other places I've been to."}
{"text":"There is a reason Milano's has been in business for over 40 years; they deliver on quality and good customer service.  The pizzas are thin crust, fully loaded with toppings, great quality cheese but yet it never gets soggy. My favourite is the Milano's Super as you get an astonishing bite of everything! The wings are right up there with some of the best. They are big, juicy, flavourful and perfectly cooked. I am more of a hot wing kinda girl but the honey garlic is very impressive.  Milano's also catered lunch for two large office functions we held and they showed up right on time, no mistakes were made and the pizzas and wings went over like a dream with everyone. I had many inquiries as to where we ordered from as the staff thought it was the best pizza we ever had delivered.  It is a sin that I have lived out this way for almost 10 years and only tried Milano's recently. I am now totally hooked for life!"}
{"text":"One small nitpick, they're ALWAYS out of slices.  I've never seen a pizzeria say \"we're out of slices\" so many times.  Make another pie guys!  When 3 people in a row walk in asking for slices and two of them leave with nothing, you're pissing off customers and costing yourself sales...MAKE MORE SLICE PIES!!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I was expecting something amazing, all I got was something adequate.   PIzza was greasy  lacking flavour not cheap  Order pizza pizza instead."}
{"text":"Picked up party size supposed to be thin crust half Greek half Hawaiian taste good very thick outer crust??? Service was good."}
{"text":"Ordered from Milano's to try something different. The pizza was okay but very soggy and difficult to eat. The taste was pretty good. Delivery was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great little local pizzeria. My favorite pie is a double pepperoni.  Can't imagine anyone not loving the pizza here. Sandwiches and wings are also above average."}
{"text":"Not bad but I do think this place is WAY over priced for what you get. Slices were not fresh. Super thin crust and dried out ingredients. I'd prefer just going to Dominos across the street."}
{"text":"Ordered one time.  Just now.   Great tasting pizza.   Cooked to perfection.  Delivered early.   Will try again for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the North Hills - I have tried them all and I can't find anything quite as good.  I am from upstate New York, so good buffalo wings are a luxury item outside of the state.  I must say their wings were very good - a little on the small side, but good flavor and not too saucy.  They have incredible calzones as well - try the Deluxe or the Italian.  I saw a couple complaints about the service, but I have never had an issue.  Sometimes it isn't super personal, but what do you expect?  When a pizza place is trying to quickly take your order over the phone it is usually because they are busy.  When a place is busy, usually it is because they are good.  Just be prepared to tell them exactly what you want when you call!"}
{"text":"This place is really really good.  If you're around and craving a snack, drop by Milano's and you won't regret it.  Their pizza is absolutely amazing.  The best pizza place I know, anywhere.  The staff is awesome and super friendly, always easy to talk to in order to pass the time while you wait for your pizza to be done.  Also, I have no idea what they do to it, but their pepperoni is SO DAMN GOOD!  Like seriously.  You haven't tried a pepperoni pizza until you had Milano's - and I am not even a plain pepperoni pizza person.  Go try it!"}
{"text":"We've ordered a lot recently from Milano's Pizza - they make excellent New York style pizza and their hoagies are fantastic. Eating an italian hoagie or calzone, you can tell they are using quality meats and cheese - not your average bulk food service stuff.  There's not much space if you want to eat-in, so take-out /delivery is likely a must. You can also order online via the Slice website which adds an extra layer of convenience. This has quickly become our go-to pizza joint in the North Hills - give them a try!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh hand down!  Family owned with fresh do made daily and it shows in the finished product.  Great family who always engages when you pick your food up.  Quality product and great owners.  Insider tip - if you're ever in the mood for something different, their fish hoagie is excellent!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from this place through the Dine Inn menu from the Marriott Courtyard. They delivered with a minimum purchase. I believe that was $15 or $25. The food was average quality. Not the best, but not the worst. It was a little overpriced, but this is expected for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Milano's is one of the best places to get a great-tasting pizza. Delivery is always on time. They certainly don't skimp when it comes to toppings. And it's nice to eat a pizza that doesn't need to be sopped up with so many napkins - not once have we done this. We've even placed orders for pick-up and they're always ready on time."}
{"text":"i wouldn't go so far as to say etobicokes best, but defiantly in the top three :) amazing service with very good flavors, the delivery was prompt and courteous.   defiantly worth going out of you're way to order this, and the price is worth it.  ive always done delivery, so im not sure about any of the inside details...sorry."}
