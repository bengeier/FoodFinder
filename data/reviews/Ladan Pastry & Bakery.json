{"text":"This place is great for authentic Persian pastries, nuts and other Persian food products.  If you're ever in the area, you should pop in and get some assorted pastries. They go great with a cup of tea or just on their own."}
{"text":"Great local Bakery with authentic Persian pastries and nuts. I can honestly say that these were the best pistachios and walnuts I have bought. They import most of their products from Iran and overseas. It's a family run place. I had a chance to speak to the owner and he was extremely nice and informative. These guys have been here for the past 20years. I respect the opinion of the previous reviewer, but in my opinion these local places is what we lack in Toronto. You will not get this kind of service and great products at the big cookie cutter stores. The pastries that they have are great. I had a cream puff and a few Persian pastries. They were all good. I'm looking forward to coming here again and trying other stuff that they have."}
{"text":"3-3.5*  So that you know what to expect, this shop is fairly small as is the selection.  So don't expect anything like Arz or Tavazo or even Patisserie Royale (for baklava).  They didn't have any Macadamia Nuts, but they seemed to have at least a coupla varieties of Pistachios.    Dessert-wise - They seem to carry more mammouls (cookies), slices of cakes, zoolbia, puff pastry type desserts.  I didn't see any baklava.  Since I drove specifically to check out this place, I felt a bit obliged to buy some stuff, so I got some walnuts (quite fresh) and a cream puff.  I asked the cashier if they're made on site and she smiled, and said, \"Yes\".  It was no Beard Papa's, choux pastry was a bit dry, but it was thin.  Cream was light, sweet, and delicious!  Ladan is a great, but small business, so it must be a bit difficult to compete with the larger, surrounding businesses!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place.  The pastries are refined and prepared with care.  You can choose what you like, (they're behind glass - which is always a good thing) and they sell it by the weight.  They have a terrific variety of products from Iran, i.e. jams, nuts and dried fruits, indescribably gorgeous baked goods, a true Iranian patisserie.  You can also buy something there, kind of like a floss.  The Chinese have something similar called \"dragon's beard candy\".  Melt in your mouth delicious.  Nice lady behind the counter, always friendly and polite.  If you are looking to take a gift to someone's house, you can purchased boxed Iranian dried fruits, nuts, etc."}
