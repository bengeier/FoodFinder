{"text":"Went there on Sunday afternoon with a group of 6 and we were there for almost 2 hours. Service was slow because the place is understaffed for some reason. Food was mediocre at best but there was a decent selection of beer. Doubt if we would stop to eat again but would stop for beer."}
{"text":"If you like greasy, butter and oil dripping food this is your place!

All 3 meals we had were dripping with butter and oil.  My burger was missing bacon, bread served when we arrived was old and cold and other 2 meals were coated in dripping oil/butter.   The seats and floor were dirty and the echo of the place made it by difficult to have a normal conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"This was a great bar with a great beer list. Travelling through and stop in because the parking lot was full. Had the onion rings, fantastic. If you like GOOD beer this is the best around here."}
{"text":"Eh.... A TV dinner would have been more satisfying. Slow service and the food all seemed like it came out of a box I'm the freezer. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"My medium well burger came out well done and dry.  Seems as though the speculation that this joint uses frozen food is accurate."}
{"text":"Maybe I had low expectations coming in after reading the Yelp reviews, but it really wasn't all that bad. It was actually pretty great, especially for Meadowlands. Our server was incredible and friendly and really made us feel like family. Our food was also good, especially compared to the chains around here. I had a phenomenal Caesar salad and a delicious fish sandwich, and topped the night off with a tiramisu that absolutely put most that I've had in the area to shame. 

The only downsides were that the lighting was a bit too dark for me, and there were more obnoxious children than at Chuck E. Cheese. Not the restaurant's fault on the last part, though. 

I definitely recommend it, especially as an alternative to the chain places in the area."}
{"text":"As always, there is hope for any new place in the neighborhood. I always venture to these local establishments in lieu of chain restaurants.  I recently discovered the new Mr Bigs, less than a mile or so from my home.  A strong aesthetic appeal makes this place warm and inviting to enter. The restaurant has a clean  classic Americana bar vibe. Plenty of TVs  easily view-able from any vantage in the restaurant make this place an ideal sports hang on any sports night of the week.  Upon further inspection you will see that the restaurant is trying to manufacture it's character - like the printed telling of the 'Mr Big\" story and available \"beer tasting flights\".  I credit the attempts but it all seems contrived. 

A fan of eating and drinking local I was glad to see East End and Church Brew on tap. But only utilizing (2 or 3) of your 15 or so taps for local brew or other commercially available micro/macro Breweries  does not make you a \"Tap Room\".  A venture into the less commercial beer options could help substantially bolster the credibility of the restaurant. (Maybe even try some local beer tastings)

I visited a few times to scope out the food situation. On my first visit, I was surprised to get push back on having the kitchen add wing sauce to a standard \"Pittsburgh\" grilled chicken salad. The chicken was barely unfrozen and the ranch was straight out of the bottle and had that processed tang that turns me off every time. 

While I give the ownership and staff a pronounced Congrats for providing the neighborhood another option. I suggest an investment in fresh made not frozen or bottled products or the addition of a Beer Guru to assist with Tap and Bottle selections."}
{"text":"Well - had Mac and cheese and the mushroom appetizer.  Had hope but just disappointment."}
{"text":"Love the beer and the bar....HATE THE FOOD.  I dont know why they cant seem to get it right.  They lettuce even sucks.  They really need to hire a whole new kitchen staff or something."}
{"text":"I went to Mr. Big's on a few occasions, and I think the best times I've ever had here are just for drinks.. 

I went yesterday for a burger before work and upon walking in and posting up at the bar I noticed the whole place was disturbingly and awkwardly quiet. Restaurants and especially bars, for that matter, are supposed to have an ambiance. There was absolutely none. I had to walk over to the juke box and play some music because I couldn't stand the eerily silent place.

As far as the food,  I can honestly say that I've had better burgers in cafeterias. Are they really gonna pass off their \"Angus Burger\" as an Angus Burger..? Are you kidding me?? It seemed more like a frozen pattie of meat that was thrown on the grill and cooked entirely too well done. The piece of meat tasted like leather.

When I said I wanted a burger, the bartender politely asked, \"Do you want a little pink, or no Pink..?\"  In my book, this is a HUGE MISTAKE!! DON'T EVER ASK A CUSTOMER THAT!! 
My reply was \"Ummmm, how about medium-rare.??\"

The whole pink or no pink remark literally gives off the impression that the cooks in the back don't know how to cook or properly tell if a burger is rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, or well done when it comes off the grill.

I ate the burger only because I was starving. 

Some of my friends walked in the door so I sat down at their table to finish my drink, and their server literally TAPPED me on the shoulder and asked if I wanted anything. WHO DOES THAT!!!??

I thought it was a friend or someone I knew, when I turned around and noticed it was the server, I kinda wanted to punch him in the face. If I wanted tapped on the shoulder I would go to my parents house or something. 

So if I ever come back to Mr. Big's it will only be for recreational drinking, that's about it."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews I didn't find Mr. Bigs all that bad. Very low key atmosphere.  Great beer selection and the people in the bar were having a great time. Staff is very friendly and it's a clean atmosphere.  I would definitely stop back for drinks!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the number of bad reviews. I've visited multiple times and have always had a good experience. They have a pretty great selection of beers and the food is typical bar food, but everything I've tried tasted great and the portions were big as well. The service on my first visit wasn't great, but it has been fine every other time."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! I really thought I was going to love this bar and will still occasionally go in there but the last 4 visits the bartenders have been terrible! If you can get them to wait on you they act like its a hassle and make it very uncomfortable. The first few times I was so pumped to live so close to a bar that has an amazing craft beer selection but after the last few times it won't be my first choice of a place to stop. I'm a bartender and have been for 13 years so I always give bartenders the benefit of the doubt because sometimes it's just a bad night but 4 different occasions is crazy"}
{"text":"Mr. Big's had a great chance to bring something new and fresh to a town that is used to chain restaurants as their main choice.  Instead of taking advantage of that, they chose to follow the same route all other new restaurants did.  Frozen, pre-portioned, and low quality ingredients are found all over the menu at Mr. Big's.  I ordered the advertised \"1/3 lbs Angus  Burger\" and I received a frozen patty that tasted as if I purchased it from the Wal-Mart sale bin.  The french fries are previously frozen, and over seasoned to make up for the low quality product.  The only part that Mr. Big's had right was the service(although the meal for the one person in our party, was late), and the ambiance was pleasant.  For drinks, if I'm looking to pay 4+ dollars for a beer I will drive to Pittsburgh for a local brew.

In summation, I will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. Went to Mr. Bigs to try Happy hour and were told that happy hour was only available if you we're actually sitting at the bar. It did not include the tables in the bar area? I have never heard of this. The waitress did not even come by enough to get us anything. We actually got up and went to the bar for drinks. We were going to order food but again she never came by so we actually left and went and go wings and beer for less than the price of 4 beers at Mr. bigs. Won't be going back. It was also so loud that you couldn't hear the person sitting directly beside you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Good mushroom and steak wrap. The buffalo wings wer Eh, but good thai chili wings! I doubt I would come back. It is new so we waited an hour but we expected that. Beer prices are REAL HIGH though. Freakin $8 for a tallboy!"}
{"text":"I am glad it isn't a chain but it is bar food."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with this place?  The entire experience I had in this place was awful.  This includes the atmosphere, the food, and the staff.  Just an all around terrible establishment.

Went with a few friends because we figured it couldn't be as bad as everyone was telling us it was.  Well we were right...it was worse.  We started off with the Spinach Artichoke dip.  It was pretty terrible.  They must keep it frozen and put it in the microwave when someone orders it.  It was not cooked all the way through, and it was cold on the bottom.  They must not have mixed it after they took it out of the microwave.  Decided to get some beers to get the awful taste out of our mouths.  This must be their strategy because the beers are severely overpriced.  Way too much for draft beers.  The Import/Craft selection was pretty outrageously priced as well.  Every bar in the area has cheaper drinks.

We all ordered sandwiches for dinner.  They were alright.  Nothing great at all.  Just some meat slapped between 2 buns.  Can't really mess it up.

Now I guess I'll talk about the staff.  There was a heavyset, balding bartender who waited on us.  Man, this guy was miserable.  He was very disrespectful to our group as well as the others around us.  When we mentioned the dip being cold he pretty much just laughed at us.  He would only pay attention to orders from women.  He would ignore us when we needed new drinks and would only wait on the women.  Also, his creepy appearance took it to a whole new level.  He would stare at them as they tried to drink which was amusing to us.  I tried to talk to the manager about this bartender, but she was having none of it.  Didn't catch her name....short girl with dark hair.  She had an even worse attitude than the bartender.  She was just a miserable person and would not help with anything at all.  Those 2 staffers and the awful food will be the reasons I will never go back.  Mr. Big - you need to do something about this dreadful staff you employ.  I suggest a change or you will continue to lose customers."}
