{"text":"Clean, friendly, bright. We've been getting sandwiches from there for over a year now. They are made to order and they don't skimp on the fillings. Really fresh bread and fast too! Great little place for all kinds of quick food. Their deli potato salad is really good too!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and discovered this place is a 3 minute drive from me. I work from home and only get short breaks during the day. I was in and out in under 5 minutes, and I ordered a sandwich. I was very pleased by that. This was around 3 in the afternoon. I'd venture a guess that they are busier at other times. I went in for chips and a soda, but there is a $5 limit on card purchases. So, I got a sandwich as well. 

I got the chicken salad sandwich. The chicken salad appeared and tasted fresh. The bread and cheese as well. It was pretty good. Not the best I have ever had in my life, but still pretty tasty. The only issue was that there was a little too much mayo involved for my liking. Other than that, it was a good bite for a decent price. Got a 6 inch sandwich, coke, and a bag of chips for $8. Sure, you can get cheaper at the Subway down the street, but the quality of the sandwich I got at Pit Stop was much better. 

The young woman who rang me up was really nice, cheerful, and chatty. The one who made my sandwich seemed to be less than enthused about her life, but she didn't spit in my food, so... call it good. Overall first impression: Quick, convenient, decent food, decent people. I'll probably go there again."}
{"text":"Great little corner store!   Well stocked selection of beer and wine, sandwiches made to order!   I was thrilled to discover they carry Campbell's Popcorn, including my all time fav, dichotomy popcorn (cheddar and caramel corn together).   Always clean and bright.  The staff is always helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"No time for photos of everything; we were too hangry!!!

We would stop here as kids & grab snack, but this is my third try in the past few months & everything is still awesome!!  I recommend a hot ham & American cheese (toasted) with light toppings & extra mayonnaise!  Superb!  You can taste all the flavors of the fresh bun, their ham is sliced deliciousness, American cheese is real (it'll take you back in time to the good ole' days), and their mayo sets it off just right!  Well surpasses any fast food joints or those frozen meat sub chain locations!!"}
{"text":"The Pit Stop is super convenient. Staff is friendly and they always have PBR in stock."}
{"text":"This is a great little deli. There sandwiches are so delicious and the people are so nice."}
{"text":"Beer prices are NOT state minimum.  6 pack of Pacifico was $3.00 more than Giant Eagle!  Like to buy local but a bit excessive.

Whenever I ordered a sandwich. One reason or another it wasn't available.  

Frustrating!"}
{"text":"The Pit Stop Deli is located fairly close to a hotel I stay at for work when visiting Cleveland - the Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Airport location is within a mile of Pit Stop Deli.

Pit Stop Deli makes fresh subs. I came in late one afternoon to order a sub to take back to the hotel. I ordered their version of an Italian Sub, plus a bag of chips and a bottle of water.

I got back to the hotel and prepared to chow down on my sub. I was disappointed to see how little meat the sub contained - and way to much bread - a very thick sub roll.

While the sub tasted good - next time I will request extra meat - and see if they can remove some of the sub roll bread - it would be nice to have more of a balance between the meat and bread.

Service was good and prompt.

{"text":"This hidden little corner store is in a great location for locals.  I have some friends that live within walking distance of the Pit Stop Deli.  Needless to say, we've made late night beer runs without the worry of a DUI.  Last night, I bought a 5-hour Energy drink from here instead of a sugary energy drink per the cashier's recommendation.  He wasn't wrong and the 5-hour energy really worked with no hangover/side effects.

The cashier is super cool and they have fruit smoothies on tap all the time.  The beer selection is great, but a little pricey.  However, I'm willing to pay extra for the convenience.

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I took my pooch down to the river this morning via Puritas. I noticed this convenience store on top of the hill, just before you enter the metroparks. It is oddly located in an all residential area.

I expected a poorly stocked dump, but found a clean open space full of varied products. They had the usual pop,chips, car stuff and lotto. But the beer and wine selection was stunningly diverse. I picked up a six of Ithaca Brewing Apricot Wheat and a halloween scratch off. Not for the park, for later! Never seen that brand around these parts, and i like visiting Ithaca. They take the card, no minimum(also rare among delis). Oh, and they make samiches. I haven't tried one yet. But if you are taking a date down to the park or going golfing, and forgot a picnic basket, stop by for last minute provisions. Get your date a 40 oz. all her own and some jerky to set the mood.

So once in the woods, I noticed what was either a stray dog, wolf or wolfman ahead on the trail. Here are some forest safety tips:

1.Find the biggest stick you can carry in case you need to beat the living F*ck out of something.
2.Take plenty of fluids. Water in the summer and whiskey in the winter. Fall and spring call for hot cocoa with a shot of Kahlua.
3.Take a camera. You never know when you will see some hipster sporting a headband and a mustache. Submit photo to LATFH. Or beat with giant stick."}
{"text":"This little corner store was a great find! We needed a sandwich, and were going to settle for fast food, when we spotted the Pit Stop.  Were rewarded by a well constructed sandwich on fresh rolls, filled with sliced-to-order meats and cheese, accessorized by a generous selection of toppings: banana peppers, olives, red onion, etc, and a choice of condiments."}
