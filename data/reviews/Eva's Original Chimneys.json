{"text":"They just have a pop up store in Yorkdale concept. We try the Mocha one which is the limited edition. But one thing they can only pay by CARD ."}
{"text":"Insane!!  So good.... So. Much. Food. 
Go hungry, and forget eating for hours afterwards. 
If sweet is not your thing, they have savoury options...

Kürt?skalács for the win!!!"}
{"text":"The soft serve itself was meh, but the cone was really good! It was cool to watch them make them behind the glass but I can't justify the price with the quality of ice-cream they're using.

The store layout is awkward and tight when it comes to ordering and passing by the side counter. Not many seats and can get crowded easily. The service was decent, though."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious cones. It's also fun to watch them being made, assembly-line style -- it gives you something to do while waiting in the usually long-ish line.

What is kind of inexcusable, though, is how incomparable the actual cones are to the pictures -- they are nothing alike, and the reality is pretty disappointing, visually. If the pictures were accurate I would be perfectly happy, but they are an incredibly obvious deception once you receive your order. Disappointing.

But still delicious and fun."}
{"text":"Interesting experience, truly, BUT an $11!!!!!!!! cone? its good, but overwhelming in terms of price, size and the place is pandemonium incarnate.  It is, however, really interesting w.r.t. flavour combos, and the surprise chocolate in the bottom is fun."}
{"text":"I tried the famous Chimney ice cream dessert at the Woodbine Park food truck festival tonight and it was glorious! Soft-serve ice cream made with real cream (you can taste the difference!) enveloped in a deep fried dough cone dipped in sugar and cinnamon - really you can't got wrong with this dessert. There are also an assortment of delicious toppings available like Nutella, chocolate, brownie bits....

They're $9+ per cone - not cheap - but worth the occasional treat. It's an original take on a traditional dessert and it works!

Did I mention... Every other person in Woodbine Park was eating one of these! ... Or shall I say devouring!"}
{"text":"First time trying churros cone, quite a nice experience. They made fresh to order and you can look while they're making, that's cool. Order the flavour of apple pie, it tastes good but the vanilla ice cream dripped so quickly and not enough topping so it's kinda plain when get to the bottom."}
{"text":"Came back for my 2nd time -  just had to write how this place is still amazing. I like to really test these 5 star places of mine once in a while, get an item where I normally wouldn't be into it and see if they do it well enough to convert me. I'm not the biggest fan of raspberries so I got the white chocolate cheesecake raspberry cone -  for sure a convert now. Took some new people to Eva's on this visit, all were happy. So happy to see they are opening one in Square one!"}
{"text":"Great idea, but SO busy and the staff are so overworked and tired. I feel bad for them. Their basic cones and ice cream are awesome. The cone is delicious and worth the wait. I've also tried the apple one...which wasn't great. Flavours were way too overpowering and the apples tasted disgusting."}
{"text":"I got the Banoffee Pie chimney ice cream (graham crumble + candied banana), which cost $11 including tax. It was expensive for what you are getting, but it was good to try. The ice cream itself is your typical run-of-the-mill soft serve. What differentiates this is the chimney cone. It was different than any ice cream cone I've ever had, and it was quite delicious. The crunchiness and sweetness pair well with the ice cream and the accompanying garnish. However, with the soft-serve not being noteworthy, I was a bit disappointed given all the hype. Having said that, it was still a good combination of ice cream and specialty cone, with the chimney compensating for most of the soft-serve's mediocrity."}
{"text":"It was absolute delight to just see how they were making the stuff.. and it tasted wonderful.. although a little overpriced, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually big on desserts and sweet stuff, but these are one of the few sweet things I actually get cravings for. The peanut butter pretzel parfait cone is TO DIE FOR.. my only complaint is the size - its way too big for one person to finish in one sitting.. I'd rather they have all their cones half the size and half the price. Wouldn't feel so guilty eating it more often then, as I wouldn't be throwing away half a perfectly delicious treat or else consuming more calories than I wished to to avoid feeling guilty for wasting. 
They usually have a line up, but it's surprisingly short (I don't understand why sweet jesus's line ups are way longer) plus the line up here is entertaining as you watch the process of the cones being made. Makes for a good IG story 
Highly recommend... Even for people who usually don't have a sweet tooth (it's the mix of the sweet and the savory that makes this sooo )"}
{"text":"Tried this today (not the store but at a food truck festival) they are delicious! Not too messy to eat.  The ice cream was nice and creamy. Will definitely have this the next time I see them at a festival."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with delicious food and pleasant staff! Check it out. I could see this blowing up on instagram haha"}
{"text":"Yummy. It's basically ice cream truck ice cream. Love the chocolate ball at the bottom of the chimney. I had the Dream Cone which is \"Toronto's favourite\" and I really enjoyed it. It's quite expensive for ice cream but a nice treat nonetheless. I came on a Tuesday evening at there was no line up. The grasshopper s'more had marshmallows halfway."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto Chimneys food truck today during a visit to Evergreen Brickworks. The line was very long but I thought we could pass the time waiting in line while eating some food from the nearby Heirloom food truck. The line up to pay took about an hour, with another half an hour wait added on top of that to get my cone. I thought that the ice cream tasted very delicious - I loved it and it had a slight hint of coconut that tasted just right. I chose berrylicious which comes with a layer of Nutella and berry compote, and you just can't go wrong with Nutella. The donnut cone is pretty cool because it's hardened on the outside but is still fairly soft on the inside. However, I thought that the donnut tasted just like a standard bread dough, nothing special, and that the amount of sugar coating was a bit much. I assume that they may have needed to add that much sugar to make sure that the cone gets hard enough to hold the ice cream properly, so no big deal, I just didn't end up eating the whole cone. At the end of the cone, however, I found a surprise ball of chocolate which they use to cover up the hole at the bottom of the cone, which was a nice added surprise. Overall, not bad, my favourite part is the soft serve ice cream itself, but I wouldn't wait an hour for it the next time around."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their ice cream is delicious but the cones are more! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves ice cream."}
{"text":"OMG - what a unique dessert experience (in our case it was a decadent substitute for lunch). Had the dream cone, apple crumble and the peanut butter pretzel parfait. All were delicious, with sumptuous ice cream and toppings. As for the \"cone\" ... well ... suffice to say none of us have ever tasted anything like it - a baked donut dough spiral treat from the Gods. 

We will definitely come back...a great reason to revisit Toronto."}
{"text":"I ate dream cone. It was really gooooood :)
I will try another flavour, maybe apple one!!"}
{"text":"Love this cone. Tried original one with a slice of strawberry. you will get a chocolate ball at the end. There were long line but you will get soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to try like every one else. little pricey and you have to pay by card (no cash which is smart) . I think the concept and the look of the cone is more appealing than the taste. It has different toppings, cute decorations, other than that the taste is like any other ice cream. But I think it is heaven for ice cream lovers. I am not big on ice cream but never the less I liked how they prepared the cone."}
{"text":"Eva's Chimney is a brand new shop that's opened downtown and the only place where you can get their special donut cones. It was their first week of opening and the place was extremely hyped by social media so there was quit a big line up but only a 10minute wait. I ordered the coconut cone with chocolate soft serve and it was quite a let down. It was not bad but it definitely wasn't amazing. The cone was made it a bummer, it was fairly hard and not that hot, me and my friends were all expecting something soft and warm. The ice cream was your general, good tasting soft serve. 3/5 for me and I don't think I'd come again."}
{"text":"Those Chimdogs are out of control. Probably the best hotdog I ever had. I've had the ice cream chimneys before ne they are great but the chimdogs are a really nice addition."}
{"text":"It was a big mistake coming here on a hot summer day because when I walked out that door, my ice cream basically melted on the spot! It's a nice place with lots of options. I will definitely be back but maybe when it's not so hot outside. I hate speed eating ice cream, I feel I can't fully enjoy it when I speed eat."}
{"text":"Soft serve was great but I found the cone itself was not served hot/warm and was too hard. Didn't actually eat any of it and the same happened with my friend's cone. However, did see others who demolished the whole thing so maybe there is some inconsistency"}
{"text":"I actually visited the North York Location at Yorkdale Mall which is a great place to get your chimneys if you're not into lining up. I've had the original chimney pastry in Prague and can confirm that I actually prefer the taste of Eva's. 

We went on Black Friday and got two chimneys for the price of one (SCORE!). We had the holiday flavours - gingerbread and dark chocolate. Both were AMAZING. The pastry was warm and fluffy and the toppings were crunch and delicious. They added flavour without being too sweet which I find is a common problem for these types of gourmet desserts!

I would definitely skip the Ice cream, I think part of what makes a chimney amazing is how warm and soft they are. 

Tip: They have loyalty cards with stamps so if you have enough chimneys, you can get free ones!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after reading that they now have vegan soft serve. It was AMAZING. The vegan soft serve tastes just like regular soft serve (wasn't watery like some places), and the donut cone was out of this world. Definitely not an every day item as I've probably gotten my sugar fix for the next year and beyond, but it was certainly decadent and hit the spot for a very occasional treat.

Only strange thing - so I don't know if it was just my cone of if they're all like this, but there was no \"bottom\" to the cone. They put it in a paper sleeve, and when I got down to the the bottom, I realized the sleeve was wet and cold - I pulled it out and noticed there was a gaping hole (closed off by a strawberry - certainly a nice surprise!), but there was a pool of ice cream at the bottom. It's a small thing but it bothered me slightly. Not a big deal though."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience first time here the customer service was amazing even with a line it was fast I have to say sorry bang bang your awesome too but the line is always epic"}
{"text":"Had the Cinnamon Sugar with Nutella spread (filled cones seemed too big). The cone was warm, fresh and chewy; and can't really go wrong with Nutella. The combination was all kinds of yummm. Although I would have liked a bit more Nutella, some of the doughnut cone was dry. Don't remember the exact price but it was around $7.

Also, had a bit of the soft-serve; it was fresh. 

The truck was at the Streetsville food festival and we went in the evening so the line up was insanely long. We waited over an hour (butttt the cone was worth the wait).

\"Our base dough is made with 100% natural and mostly organic ingredients and is vegan. There are only seven ingredients.\""}
{"text":"One star for great ice-cream and cone but awful customer service at the cash. Cashier does not understand English no matter how it's pronounced or no matter how many times each topping is repeated. After a 10 minutes long confusing situation of trying to make her understand what we want the orders still came out wrong. Both toppings and sizes. Disappointing."}
{"text":"When it comes to treat time, my girlfriend and i are on a Quest. Looking for our weekly indulgence together to make sure we get the most of our ice cream, cake, bun... we both had on our list the chimney cone but always pass on for something more attractive. But when we heard that they paired up with gloryhole donughts for a CNE special cone. We had to go for it.

The CNE exclusive chimneys cone with the OG base ice cream include the cinnamon cone, vanilla ice cream and hidden chocolate truffle at the bottom. Then covered with salted caramel drizzled and a full donut as a crown. 

Overall quite tasting and decadent. It was for sure the best way sastified our sweet tooth. It is quite sweet and i wouldnt be able to finish one by mysef. Attack one of thoses with a friend or a fearless partner."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and I'm pretty impressed! The donut cone is super fresh and tasty! I never really thought of donuts and ice cream, but the combination is delicious! 

I tried the peanut butter pretzel parfait with chocolate soft serve. The soft serve is very creamy and thick. After finishing the soft serve, there is a load of peanut butter in the cone. I little surprized because I thought the peanut butter would be spread onto the inside of the cone, but instead, the entire inside was filled with peanut butter. I had to scoop out some of the peanut butter as it was a little too much. However, the cone with the peanut butter tastes very very good. I would definitely recommend this cone, but probably would tell them to not put as much peanut butter. 

Pretty pricey, but also very delicious and unique. Would probably treat myself every once in a while."}
{"text":"Must must must try these if you are in the Toronto Area! Look up where the food truck is located online. The ice cream and the cone were amazing! Would definitely try the other options (since I got the original) next time I go! They are a little pricy (original was $9) but it's so worth it! I wish I could have seen the way they are made. It was rainy outside and the tent was closed up to keep rain out. Already craving one now!"}
{"text":"What a treat! It was my birthday yesterday, and my friend and I had just had a really disappointing dinner at a restaurant that literally plopped a tiny dessert in front of me with a candle on it and walked away. Didn't even say happy birthday! Well my friend knows me so well and suggested we come here to share a cone. We ordered The Dream Cone to share, and I told them it was my birthday so we were out celebrating...we sat down for a few minutes and they showed up with this perfect gorgeous cone with a candle on top and said Happy Birthday! It was so sweet of them and really made my night. It was delicious! Definitely the best dessert I have had in a really long time! They were so nice, and was really nice to see genuine smiles when you spoke to them. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to try a Chimdog but was told it would take about 20mins because they did not have any rolled.  Bit of a let down when you have a short time to get food 20mins is a long wait."}
{"text":"I want to start off by noting I was supper excited to try these. I have seen them around but never had the opportunity to try them. Than I went to the Bread & Honey festival and there they were. I was so happy.

Unfortunately the hype isn't all its cracked up to be. 

I order the original so I can base the first try on something untouched. The other mixes and combinations did seem interesting but I wanted to start at the beginning. 

The portion I have to admit was good for the price.

The cone was over powering with the sugar to the vanilla ice cream. After awhile my tongue felt numb and it became to much. I thought it was just to much cold ice cream but even after a while that feeling didn't go away. 

The rough sugar made a sandpaper texture and after a while of constant licking, numb tongue is the result. 

The ice cream is good, being a soft serve but over all this experience fell flat for me.

Unless your a huge sweet lover, just stick the regular cones."}
{"text":"The staff were extremely rude and annoyed by any one asking questions. I can kind of understand as it must be long busy days for them. However, a little bit more respect to their customers would be greatly appreciated. The ice cream itself is very good though !!!


The owner contacted right away regarding the service I received ... glad to see that they care about their customers!!! Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmm. Very delicious. Only negative was the server took too much time. They were still very warm. I had the chocolate one highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Great dessert place in the Annex area. I love their ice cream choices and their cone is to die for. Their chimney dessert is quite filling and pricey so I suggest sharing with someone. Will be back during the summer."}
{"text":"I got to come to Eva's during it's grand opening and my fave is defs the raspberry marscapone! There is typically a line up but I would say it's totally worth the wait. After eating one, I can't go back to a normal ice cream cone."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????1%2%3%??????????????
??????????????????
1?????????????2????????????????
Cozy and nice place for snack. Feel like a little bit too much for one person, better for sharing."}
{"text":"What is the hype about this place? Someone please explain it. Having seen all the social media posts about Eva's, I knew I had to stop by the next time I was in the city so I fit it into our schedule and stopped here at 3pm on Sunday (today). I was happy to see that despite the reviews telling me there would be a long wait, we were the only ones there. After speaking to the lady at the counter, and having her explain how things worked, I ordered the  mini tiramisu cone. The first piss off was the fact that I was told I had to pay something like $10.50 when the larger size was only $9.75. I asked how this could be and she told me that the mini was a customized size where we had to pay $1 per topping so it comes out to be more expensive. I made it clear that this was something I should have been told BEFORE they started making the cone (They started before I paid) and that I wasn't going to spend more money on less product. The lady at the counter quickly and rudely said 'well we won't give it to you'. I obviously didn't want the cone for free and was pretty out off by her comment. At this point, the lady making the cone (having just added the icecream) set it aside until we figured out payment. The lady at the cash took so long to figure out what to do that within ten minutes, a lineup around the store formed. In the end, to make a long story short, I paid $7 for the tiramisu cone which was more reasonable but I ended up getting pool of molten icecream since it sat on the side for 10 min, and it was nothing special! The cinnamon cone itself was dry and flavorless and the icecream is basically McDonalds grade soft serve, so again, not understanding the hype (putting aside the other drama). I was so glad we didn't wait in line - definitely not worth it at all and wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"Service: 

I came here on a Thursday night with the lineup reaching outside their door. I was very impressed that I only had to wait around 10 minutes in line. Staff were professional and quick, they had a very efficient system going which is great.

Taste/price: 

 I would say the prices of their ice cream cones are around $12, which is very much on the steeper side. 

The cone though, is so delicious. I tried the cinnamon sugar as well as the one with Graham crackers. Both tasty, super soft and crispy. 

The ice cream itself was nothing special, a typical vanilla soft serve. I wish they'd make more soft serve flavours rather than putting different toppings on plain soft serve. My friend and I had the apple crumble and raspberry cheesecake. Both delicious overall and very..very filling! It is almost a meal itself. This could be shareable with two people. What makes this desert unique is the cone. I think I would just buy the cone separately next time. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Had the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake chimney and while each component was individually fairly yummy, the overall product isn't very \"functional\", but rather just a do-it-for-the-pic treat. Would definitely be improved by having the components evident throughout.
The only thing white chocolate and raspberry in the entire dessert was a sad drizzle on top which inevitably disappeared first, leaving you with a ridiculous melting mountain of plain soft serve ice cream. The actual cone was really good- soft and doughy on the inside with a nice crisp, but all the cheesecake is stuffed inside the cone, making it really heavy (could've definitely used some of that ice cream here!)  Redeemed itself a little with the nice surprise chocolate ball plugging the bottom of the cone.
In retrospect I probably should've gotten the smaller size, but considering the small difference in price vs. large size difference it really doesn't make sense to get the smaller. Also a little pricey for what it is ($11 incl tax), but would be good for sharing."}
{"text":"A cute treat for once in a while. Super sweet and decadent soft serve with various toppings and a sugar covered donut cone. Approximately $10 per cone so just be prepared. Cashless shop so bring a card. Enjoy on a hot summer day or as a treat when you are super depressed."}
{"text":"Interesting Japanese twist on an ice cream, but rather expensive for what it is. They also do not take cash, meaning bring debit or credit cards. I know the rent at Yorkdale is expensive, and making your own cones in house is not cheap, but 6-10$ for a cone is ridiculous. I tried the traditional one to say i did so, and to see what the hype was about, but wont be going back. There is no value for what you get, and it seemed to hipster for my liking. If an imitator type competitor appears at a better price point for something similar, they are in trouble."}
{"text":"The chimney cake is dough wrapped around a metallic cone and then baked over open heat. Then it's filled with soft serve (the same kind you get in ice cream trucks). They only have vanilla atm. The dream come ($10) is vanilla ice cream with 2 small pieces of brownies, chocolate syrup and caramel. The soft serve wasn't ready yet (he'd just put it into he machine) so it was really gooey and melted before we could finish the cone.

Was it good? Yeah. Was it worth standing in line for 1.5 hours? Absolutely not!!!

It's not shown in the picture, but the line loops around, and I was already half way through the line, meaning there were more people behind me. Try to imagine how long this line was."}
{"text":"This was really nice, I got a birthday cake sort of flavour which I wasn't a fan of, but the cone itself was very tasty. The line was a little long though."}
{"text":"This place is fun but really just an unsustainable trend. I certainly don't regret trying it but I likely wouldn't go again. They only sell one size, and it's size huge. The small cones can only be ordered with original soft serve. For the specialty ones, aside from their large size (almost everyone ends up throwing some out) they are pretty expensive for what you get. I got the apple pie option and basically felt it was just vanilla soft serve with caramel sauce on top and that I could have gotten the small one had I wanted that plain. I did end up finding the apple portion of the cone, a small blob of apple pie filling buried about half way in. Though I wasn't disappointed, it was indeed delicious, I was pretty full by the time I had reached it."}
{"text":"A bit east of Bathurst station, this Hungarian gem has desserts that both vegan and non-vegan can rejoice in. Most toppings are default vegan unless specified and most menu items can be made vegan.

For $8.95, I had the heavenly Berrilicious Chimney Cone, which got its name from its hollowed cylindrical-shaped dough that is crispy, light and fluffy with a generous amount of rock sugar for added sweetness. The strawberry jam feeling oozes on top of the ice cream and there is a ball of dark chocolate that holds it all together at the very bottom of the cone.

Everything is made right in front of you in their open kitchen and the place was nuzzling during our entire visit. Definitely worthy to be go-to destination dessert place. Can imagine myself being satisfied with any one of their menu items. Very fast service. Clean. Guilt-free."}
{"text":"I am definitely not big on desserts, but I knew I should try Eva's at least once.  My friend and I went here today around 6 PM. Lucky for us, there was no line on a Friday evening! She ordered the tiramisu chimney cone, and I had the lemon berry mascarpone.  By the way, they don't accept cash! I only realized this when I got to the counter, so I paid with credit card instead.  The tiramisu cone had a nice flavor of espresso coffee near the top of the soft serve, where the tiramisu powder was. However, inside the cone there was a soggy bit of tiramisu cake, which just did not taste that great after it was soaked in ice cream.  My lemon berry mascarpone flavor was sweeter and went well with the vanilla soft serve.  However, I did not like the chocolate truffle at the bottom too much, as I am not a big fan of chocolate flavors. I wish they had used a white chocolate truffle instead. Another suggestion is that this would fast much better if the cones were warmer!

The service was friendly, and I appreciate that they use local ingredients and bake their cones fresh.  However, each of our cones was $11, which I felt was quite steep for a dessert like this.  It was good to try once, but I cannot guarantee that I would go here again simply because of the price point."}
{"text":"Waited 40min but the chimney cone ice cream was worth the wait!
The bread was crispy with perfectly blended taste of cinnamon and coarse sugar. And the ice cream was so delicious fresh and creamy!!
Only thing is that I think it is a bit pricey ($8 for the original)"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression ---

I found this food truck on Instagram. I thought it was pretty cool to have soft-served ice-cream inside a donut cone. After finding out that yesterday was the first day they launched the chimney cone with ice-cream, I knew I had to give it a try. The lineup was very long, it took us 50 minutes in the line to wait to order and another 35 minutes to pick up our cones. However, you won't get bored during the wait since the food truck was inside the Evergreen Brick Works and they were hosting an Etsy market there. We shopped around when we were waiting to pick up our chimney cones. 

-- Food & Drink --

We ordered 2 items:

1. Dream Cone (aka the Ultimate) -- Nutella coated on the interior of the baked Hungarian pastry. Butter toffee bits and salted caramel brownie were layered on top of the vanilla soft serve cone. 

2. Eva's Apple Pie -- Similar to the dream cone, the Hungarian pastry was covered with cane sugar and cinnamon, the interior was filled with homemade apple preserves and topped with vanilla soft serve ice-cream. They put a chocolate truffle in the bottom of the cone to prevent the sauce from leaking out of the cone, which was pretty smart. 

I found both cones are very delicious. Personally I like the Eva's Apple Pie more because cinnamon sugar simply complements the apple sauce better. The apple sauce was very tangy and wasn't too sweet. I found the cones very big and they were perfect for sharing. 

-- Overall --

Even though it took us a long time to wait for the chimney cones, they taste heavenly good and I would definitely go back to revisit them. The food truck owner gave everyone a gift, a free chimney cone for our next purchase, for being supportive on their launch day. I can't wait to go back this summer to try other flavors. :)"}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment visit as I am not in this area often (set to change soon as lots of interesting places around here) I saw lineups out the door and I was ok must be a newest fad spot. Then when I got near this place and saw the name recalled having bookmarked this place when it opened. I like the marketing ploy they use here with the fresh chimneys?! (Haven't heard of these before) being prepared by the window. Decided to give it a try. This is a well oiled operation as the lines kept moving and the workers seemed very efficient. I decided on the mascrapone lemon tart as enjoy mascrapone quite a bit. 
After a bit of a wait due to long lines I got my dessert. Visually appealing it's sure to make Instagram waves. Pity I prefer the actual flavors as opposed to just visuals. The dessert itself is more like a soft serve with the initial taste of mascrapone nothing much to report other than the toppings. The chimney itself is good and will bring me back for a smaller portion."}
{"text":"Yet another unique and interesting ice cream idea in the city, however I believe the items on the menu are all essentially very similar, a very sugary soft served ice cream on a very sweet cone. The idea is very well but it is not my favorite. The experience is too sweet and the portions are too big. So by the end you will struggle to finish it. So I would make the portions smaller, reduce the price and reduce the sweetness!"}
{"text":"Came here because my cousin really wanted to try one of the famous chimney cones haha. Upon entry the place was packed with people so we lined up, i got the mango with thai sticky rice and my cousin got the tiramisu. 
I was really disappointed with the mango and sticky rice chimney cone. First the ice cream tasted like generic vanilla flavour soft serve drizzled with some mango syrup. Under first layer of soft serve was where i hit my gold mine of thai sticky rice :D 
I dont know if the rice was old or undercooked but it was definitely NOT fresh. It was dry and hard like eating grains of sand. If anyone has ever had sticky rice at a proper thai restaurant you would understand why i chose this flavour for my chimney cone. The cone itself was basically bread with glazed sugar on top. I don't know why but for some reason i had expected a little more of it being something sort of like a beaver tail or something with better texture and flavour. At the bottom of the cone you get a nice piece of lindor chocolate though. The tiramisu was better but not by much.
This was a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of quality. I would say a more reasonable price would be $6.00 maybe $8 max but $11 for this you are better off buying 2 tubs of your favourite hagen daaz ice cream."}
{"text":"After my horrible experience at SweetJesus Im weary of new ice cream places .However Eva's has completely changed my mind. I will say its a bit pricey $13 for my berry cone however it was a one time thing and so worth it. The cone was flaxy and tender ., the berries were fresh and flavourful. The ice cream had a good consistency and wasn't overly sweet or salty. I though the frozen chocolate truffle in the bottom of the cone was a great touch and really kept my icecream from seeping out the end."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try one of these chimney stacks today. I was already a little full so I opted for a mini ($9.75) with a raspberry cone, Nutella and toffee bits. I should have just got a full sized one, would have been cheaper. The price is ridiculous for ice cream, but I do appreciate the labour involved in rolling dough on a mould and such. 
The soft serve is the usual, pretty basic in taste and texture. The cone is what makes this place unique since you can get these toppings at pretty much any ice cream place these days. The crispness with fluffy inners was quite delicious and crunchy in a weird way. Weird, but good
I'm sure I will give it another go, my friend is crazy for it and he usually steers me write when it comes to ice cream"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! I visited here twice on my trip to a recent conference. Eva's was a stop on one of the event's Trend Safaris. The owner shared her story of creating the business and how Eva's has basically been an overnight sensation in Toronto. EVERY person that orders here shares their chimney on instagram. I was guilty too. They are beautiful and delicious. Lots of different flavors with a great variety in tastes. Highly recommend adding to your trip to the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Seriously, overhyped and overrated. Seeing pictures of these cones posted EVERYWHERE on social media, I was dying to have one. Perhaps I was disappointed because of my anticipation and my expectations got really high because of the hype! I was imagining a warm doughy donut or churro cone with cinnamon sugar, sounds good right? Topped with softserve, chocolate sauce, brownie and all the fixins. Sounds delicious? No?

Well, needless to say I was sadly disappointed. Went with a friend down to union station on a very hot day. Thought it was perfect day for ice-cream. Ordered the Dream Cone and why not? I was here to go all out! Okay first of all, there was no warm doughy goodness, did I get a bad cone? I didn't pay 11 bucks for a bad one. It was thin and hard but not crunchy. Didn't taste like any donut or churro I know. Taste kind of like a stale danish. The cone was so disappointing because it kind of makes the cone. The softserve didn't help either, it was plainest of the plain ones, perhaps worse than McDs. And then all the toppings were overly sweet. I think the proportion of the chocolate to the softserve was off. There was not enough ice-cream so literally at the end you were just eating chocolate syrup, nutella, toffee bits and a hard cone. AND to make the sweetness worst, they had stuck a Lindt truffle ball at the end of the cone, I guess to \"plug\" the hole at the bottom. That was sugar overload. It wasn't mentioned in the menu, if I had known it was there I might not have ordered it. 

Yes, disappointing, disappointed. I will not be back. Is someone going to come up with a Cronut cone? Please."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and I don't plan to stop. 

I've tried the original, matcha, and the decadent drip cone... They're all sooo good. My favourite is definitely the matcha because what other place puts crushed matcha kitkat in their soft serve? YUM. 

I'm definitely greedy when it comes to my chimney cones and I won't share them (not even with my boyfriend). The whole package (soft serve + toppings + chimney cone) is just sooo good. 

P.S. You won't want anyone stealing your lindor ball ;)"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and it didn't disappoint! I ordered the dark chocolate almond cone! It's one of the flavours for Christmas and it's so good! Ice cream with almonds and a Lidnt ball at the end! Usually people are excited by the ice cream but you get excited to reach the cone! It's a mix of cold bc of the ice cream an early from the cone that's freshly made. It's great little snack or dessert to have. You can chose a just a chimney cone cake or a cone!
Great for any age!"}
{"text":"Amazing and just what you dreamt of however if you don't generally have a big sweet tooth share it with someone because its huge"}
{"text":"Pretty good ice cream. I mean it's definitely over hyped and I wouldn't go out of my way. I felt like the cone tasted like bread which I did not expect. 

The size Is big and most cones are $8+  and they have a good selection of variety. The wait isn't that long either. 

I got the blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. I liked the toppings.

We found that ours melted very fast when we were indoors. So we had to finish eating before it got messy."}
{"text":"Omg their dreamy drizzle cake cone was to die for. So many toppings and I love peanut butter! They had peanut brittle on top and a macaron as well as a chocolate twist straw cookie as Derek as a sugar brittle. Then as you eat the ice cream there is crunchy peanuts coating the cone and peanut butter!!!!!! At the bottom of the cone there was a Lindtor chocolate suprise!!"}
{"text":"While at Yorkdale I came across the pop up stores, from my previous post I tried the pie squared, and they also had uncle tetsu and Eva's original chimneys... of course I've seen the chimneys all over fb and IG, and the hype about it. So i gotta try it out and see what it's all about. First off, my bf has a nut allergy, so prior to ordering I specifically told the girl that was taking our order that we have a nut allergy and please tell whoever is making it to be careful. So then i placed my order and I ordered the Apple crumble. As I'm waiting for ours, I was watching the girl that was making the orders. When it came to my order I saw her clean up everything and wipe down the ice cream machine cause of cross contamination. So that was a bonus. Not all places would do that.. I got my order, looks delicious and I was excited to try it. So, as I'm eating, i get to the middle where it was filled with granola, I was scooping it out with the wooden spoon and I found  pieces of nuts inside. And before that my bf had already had a few bites of the ice cream.Thank goodness he didnt get to the middle. I was in shock, why would the girl that took my order not tell me theres nuts inside the granola when i was placing my order, and I had already told her we have a nut allergy. You'd think they are well aware of the ingredients, nope... 
Anyways, so I brought it back, and spoke to this gentlemen, and told him what happened, I specifically told the cashier we have a nut allergy, and she did not tell us about the granola that has nuts in it.This gentlemen was totally aware that there are almonds in the granola. So he apologized. They ended up making a new one with just ice cream. So, future ref, if u have a nut allergy, be careful and make sure u ask about everything because clearly people that work there doesn't know anything! 
After all that, I got a new one made. But before getting the second one, i was pretty full from the first one, and I barely ate from it, the ice cream was pretty heavy. 
I did like the cone itself, it was pretty good. So for my second one i just ate the cone and threw out the ice cream. Prob wont go back to try this place out. 
So for those that have nut allergy, becareful what youre ordering, make sure u ask questions or ask to see the ingredients before placing an order."}
{"text":"I like it. Ice cream on top, crispy hot pastry cone under it, with a little surprise at the end. They definitely know how to make it an enjoyable experience from start to finish. Normally when I get a dessert it's like, it's good, but then it's kind of monotone throughout, and then you eat that last bite and that's it. No grand finale to signal the end of the adventure.

Names are taken, orders brought out to you if you take a seat. Just a little extra on the customer service. 

Cones are a bit $$ starting at minimum $9. They do have a smaller cone that's maybe $1 cheaper or something but it wasn't clear on the menu. I'd say just stick with the regular size cause judging from others' pics the mini cone is like half the size or something.

Despite the premium you're paying, if you think of other ice cream places where you get a tiny sugar cone or a slightly larger waffle cone, you're still going to be spending maybe $5 - $7 for a couple scoops. And no adventure.

Given the dessert options in k-town, I think this is a pretty good spot if you're willing to spend as much on a cone as you would a bowl of pork bone soup or lu wei."}
{"text":"Very delicious ice cream. Tried the tiramisu flavour. Interesting idea but pricy. Not sure if $10 is reasonable."}
{"text":"Well just attempted to indulge in this delicious looking apple pie ice cream in a cone... made my order attempted to pay for it.. and was informed they take debit and credit only!  So my cash in my pocket was no good.  Or I could walk back to my parked car at Spadina and return.... ummmm yo fro it is... wondering how much $ they make off of each transaction!  So pay 11 for an ice cream and 2$ service charge.... ahhhh nope!  So sad I didn't get a chance to be able to review the cones :/.    Oddly enough the quick response was appreciated, but being an owner of 2 tattoo studios, we only accept cash, as dealing with machines and passing back and forth etc is more time consuming, and germ sharing than cash ..... go figure!"}
{"text":"I may have a separate stomach just for ice cream, but I would be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that wanted to come here just for that Instagram picture. I tried this when the food truck was at Evergreen Brickworks and we even got to meet Eva! She told us that the whole concept was started by her grandkids and it's a 3-generation family run business. The best fact I learned was that the recipe had nothing to do with her! The grandkids named the company after their grandma (how cute!). 

As much as those extravagant flavours/options looked better in picture, I opted for the original cone and I have zero regrets! I couldn't finish the whole thing because the cone was actually a lot and quite filling, but of course I finished all the ice cream. 

I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Went to the pop up at Yorkdale. Pretty large portions! The cone is amazing. Very gluttonous...no way you can even finish one."}
{"text":"I tried the choco chimney with chocolate soft serve ice cream inside ( yes, I am a chocolate fanatic), it was about $8.75 plus tax. I throughly enjoyed watching them make it fresh for me. 

The service was good , the seating area was nice, and the chimney itself was amazing. It was very filling which is a huge win for me.

Would definitely go there again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I've visited this ice cream spot over five times. I feel as though the customer service and the product itself are disintegrating. Chocolate ice cream has been replaced with vanilla ice cream, even for those cones meant to be served with chocolate ice cream. However, it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I'll definitely get hate for this post, but this is yelp and I have to be honest with you. 2017 seems to be a continuation year from the following years that offer fun instagram worthy pictures, unfortunately majority of the time such foods that are categorized as so seem to be lacking in the taste area. I've said it, now I'll break it down, just because something looks pretty or is fun doesn't mean it's good by any account. Eva's , your icecream tastes like ice milk. Not sure if your recipe was off the 4 different times I've tried it. New places are forgetting what people enjoy , flavour! Toms dairy freeze on the queensway is by far the most authentic icecream in Toronto. The cone. I'm sorry it didn't do it for me. Thanks anyways."}
{"text":"Kürt?skalács In Toronto!!!

A Hungarian dessert specialty which we regrettably did not have the stomach for in Budapest, has now arrived here. Eva's truck has been parked (mostly) at Evergreen Brickworks the past month and the excitement is real - luckily we came on a rainy, chilly day and the line was less than 15 minutes long.

Aptly named the chimney cone, it is a doughy, brown sugar dusted cone stuffed with soft serve ice cream. While the cone was not hot as expected (likely to prevent the ice cream from melting too quickly), the apple pie with the homemade compote and cinnamon sprinkle was absolutely delicious. Slowly unravelling the cone layer by layer added to the fun (surprise chocolate piece at the bottom!)

Warning: a deceptively large serving especially with the amount of ice cream inside so share unless you want to substitute an entire meal :)

Check their website for where they will be next."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for new foods. It was pretty exciting to learn about this Hungarian Chimney thing opening up a store and I finally had a chance to visit. Was it worth it? I would say no. 

It's not bad, I just don't see why a piece of bread with ice cream and toppings inside justifies a price tag of something like $11 plus tax. I mean...I can get a nice dessert sundae from Tsujiri for just $7.50 and people complained that Tsujiri is expensive.

It tastes like what I expected basically. A nice chewy bread with ice cream inside. We had the tiramisu and shared one. It's a pretty filling beast. I really can't get over how expensive this thing is."}

4/5 - Venue
5/5 - Food
5/5 - Overall

I visited this location on a Friday night, and there was hardly a line or crowd. The service was very helpful and kind, and the dough is freshly baked.

Venue: The little shop is on a busy stretch of Bloor, near bars and restaurants. The storefront has a huge glass window so that you can see the cones being baked fresh. The inside boasts a fresh revived look, with a decorated brick wall and an overall colorful setting. A bar faces the wall, and two additional tables and high tables are at the back. Enough seating for maybe 15 people. The only complaint I had about the location was that with only two people working, and both behind the counter, no one was available to clean the tables or seating.

Food: I had both the Strawberry Cheesecake, and the Tiramisu. Both were excellent, and the toppings were top quality. The cheesecake bites were actual chunks of a cake, and the tiramisu had actual lady fingers soaked in coffee. The baked \"donut\" was perfectly tender and crispy, and is always freshly made per order. The employees very graciously accommodated a peanut allergy by cleaning the rollers before baking our order of cones. The soft serve ice cream was pretty standard, but the combination of the warm baked donut and toppings brought everything together. The cone is plugged with a Lindt Lindor chocolate ball, which was a nice finish to the dessert.

Overall: Service on the Friday night was excellent, and the dessert definitely lives up to it's hype. This place is pricey though, at $7.99 per large cone with toppings at $0.99 each, your total will run over $10 after tax. The pre-designed cones at $9.75, and have around 3 toppings on them. A great place for a once-in-a-while treat, or a place for a date."}
{"text":"Eva's Original Chimneys is hyped up quite a bit too much. Or at least I believe there was a hype, as my friends constantly urged me to visit here. 

The idea of having a pastry instead of your regular ice cream cone isn't new, but it's definitely rare in the GTA. Eva's got the gimmick down for sure as I don't believe business is slowing down for them. This was demonstrated by how patrons were entering at a frequent rate even on a cold wintery Saturday.  

We got three of the more expensive options, and we had very mixed feelings. 

THE GOOD:

* The cones are warm, so you could assume they are served at least half fresh

* If you like donuts or dusted pastries, you will love the cone

* The soft serve ice cream is very creamy and dense. It seems to be of higher quality than most soft serve varieties

* There's enough seating for about 3 large groups, maybe even 15 people overall

* The washrooms are clean 

* The staff members deliver your cone to your table, so you won't have to wait at the counter before hunting down a seat

* There is an abundance of crazy and traditional combinations from fruit-based ones to cocoa-based ones 

THE NOT SO GOOD:

* You pay a higher fee for a topping combination that supposedly has far more than the original standard cone, but what you actually get barely has any extra toppings. For example, all of our cones barely resembled the pictures and seemed more like the original cone with a SMIDGE of something else. Just go for the original cone; it will be almost the same but cheaper. 

* This isn't a dessert that's designed to be savoured. Since the cone is warm upon serving, the ice cream melts really quickly. Prepare for some napkin action and chow down quickly!  If you can, try eating it at one of the tables to lessen the potential of making a mess of yourself. 

* The cones are pretty pricy, even for a dessert downtown. They average between 9-12 dollars a pop. 

CONCLUSION:

Would I come back? Possibly, if a friend who hasn't eaten it before wanted to try. I wouldn't go out of my way to get one.  For the high price and lack of toppings, I would rather get a waffle/crepe elsewhere, which would probably cost the same or less but with more fillings."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a friend's wedding and leading up to it, we kept seeing these chimney cake cones on facebook going viral! So obvs when we got to Toronto, we had to make a stop here.

Luckily, the line wasn't crazy when we got there (but it got crazier as we waited) and they have a huge menu of different premade combinations and a diy section. My one gripe with the menu is you have no idea what's in each specialty item because they just have a name and no ingredients. 

They offer 2 sizes - a regular and mini. For the specialty ones, if you get a mini it's the same price as the regular.... so I ended up getting the regular size which was a life regret. There was just way too much icecream for one person (if you are reading this, SHARE). 

However, the toppings are pretty fun, while the softserve icecream is pretty mediocre. I think the chimney cake itself is the best part - and could have done with just the cake. At the bottom of the cone, they block it with a lindt chocolate to stop the icecream from melting!"}
{"text":"In a city saturated with ice cream shops, Eva's stands out as it serves soft serve ice cream inside a churros chimney cone. It is like you are eating ice cream with a cone made from a donut. 

There's a variety of different flavours. However, I like it simple. Soft serve vanilla in a churros cone with a strawberry. Simply delicious. I did not give Eva's 5 stars because the churros chimney cone is slightly pricey."}
{"text":"Having had chimneys in Czech multiple times, I would say that the ones served here are close enough in terms of the quality."}
{"text":"I got the OG chimney cone with twist ice cream and it was one of the best soft serve cones I've ever had. The soft serve itself was rich and creamy, and the cone just took it to a whole other level. It's soft and chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The cinnamon sugar adds the perfect touch of sweetness without being overpowering, and balances out the soft serve perfectly. It does get a little messy to eat at the end though. 

I went on a Friday night around 9:30pm and there wasn't too much of a wait to order, but I had to wait around 10 minutes after ordering to get my cone. The store is a little small and can get a little cramped up in the pick up area. There's also limited seating, but it isn't too bad, as most people leave once they're done eating. 

Also, they don't accept cash! Credit, debit, and Apple Pay only."}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars I would! Found this gem on a Toronto food Instagram and just had to try it!!! It was in a bustling exciting part of town and even though the line was long you could tell the staff had this thing down pat. They only take card/Apple Pay no cash which wasn't an issue. The line moved quickly and the ice cream/chimney cone was delicious!!!!!! Very messy, so grab napkins and lots of them. Establishment has ample seating and restrooms which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"When I was at Yorkdale and noticed this was in the indulge section. My fiancé and I were both excited because we saw this explode all over social media. My fiancé is highly allergic to coconut, and as told by the girl working unfortunately their batter for the chimney cone uses coconut milk; so my fiancé could not try it. I on the other hand decided to try the apple crumble cone. I thought the cone was mediocre at best, and the lack of frozen ice cream was a bit shocking to me. For $12 I feel that you can get a better dessert. I was pretty underwhelmed and a little disappointed. This is just my opinion, this is not a dessert for me."}
{"text":"Now that I have visited their storefront, I am even more in love with Eva! There were about 16 varieties to choose from, with five differently made chimney cakes for the base cone. I will hopefully be back often so I can try all of their offerings.

My recommendations include the Berry Nutella (this is very similar to the O.G. but with more berries vs. strawberries and added nutella sauce), Apple Crumble (just so good) and the new Funfetti Cake chimney (which is this twist vanilla/choc soft serve with actual funfetti cake mashed into and on top of the ice cream, nutella, sprinkles, and as always, ends the deliciousness with a chocolate ball at the very bottom of the cones' base).

So glad I finally visited their store, which is located conveniently close to bloor and bathurst, close to various parks.

There was a short line, but you don't wait too long before you are able to devour and indulge in Eva's freshly made Hungarian dessert.

Totally the best idea for a summer day."}
{"text":"I've waited 3 months to try this beauty. I visited them at their front street pop-up. The ice cream was smooth and sweet, but didn't taste artificial. The cone has a soft interior and a sweet and crunchy exterior. One of the best ice cream cones I've ever had. 

They accept credit and debit!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing well minus the fact that the entire restaurant is teeny tiny and basically there's only enough space for you to stand in line order get your dessert and walk out and if you get lucky you might be able to sit on one of the tables but there's always so many people standing right in front of you or behind you that you don't really even want to sit. The chimneys tasted amazing but I wish they would change it up and instead have gourmet ice cream that they put in instead because I think they are ruining the taste of the chimneys by putting softserve and then a bunch of nonsense toppings. I wish they also had more options for the mini because that would've been a realistic size of what I would actually have been able to eat. I got the dream cone and my husband got berrylicious. I got the vanilla and chocolate swirl soft serve and mine was lined with new Tele on the inside but there was so much Nutella it must've been at least a quarter of a jar and then there was soft serve in there was toffee pieces inside as well and on top of a little bit and also two pieces of brownies on top it was really delicious but it was incredibly chocolatey I think next time I would've just gotten plain vanilla soft serve in a mini chimney: what that maybe slight drizzle of chocolate sauce on top and that's it that would've been perfect and I could've finished it and enjoyed it without wearing about it melting. My husband is: had berry compote on the inside but it was all at the bottom of the cone and you literally had to eat all the ice cream and cones to get to the bottom and that that point it was incredibly too much to have it was really good and he enjoyed it but it was a little much for me in the end neither of us were even able to finish our Cones but it was amazing and we will definitely be back I got the cinnamon sugar on the cone and oh my God it is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"It's always busy so prepare to wait a bit and likely take your ice cream to go. Everything is delicious and looks beautiful. A must visit in Toronto for dessert lovers."}
{"text":"It wasn't all that great. I had high hopes for the chimney because I tried it in Prague before. The wait was long and annoying. This product is better in Prague. I wouldn't recommend it if you had try it before this is not the best place to have one"}
{"text":"I went to the Yorkdale location on the weekend and absolutely loved it. They were super accommodating when I told them I had a nut allergy and were super careful when making it for me. I ordered the OG (regular vanilla soft serve with the sugar chimney cone). The ice cream was super rich and creamy so it was a was a perfect pairing with the cone. It's a bit heavy but definitely worth it once in a while!!"}
{"text":"My brother is obsessed with Eva's and so we visited yet again. We didn't have to wait long in line this time but I will have you know that it does take about 10 minutes for the vibe making process! Personally, I'm the kind of person who gets more excited about the ice cream flavors rather the cone, so is is definitely not my go to. However, if you want to try something different while you're in the city definitely give it a go.!  We got the PB&J special and I have to say the cone was rather sour ( and unexpected to be) so stick to the sweeter kinds of you're there. We ended up throwing most of it out, it was rather disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here back in the winter when it first opened. Convinced my non-ice cream loving husband to take me here on Valentines Day, and even he found something to love! There are so many flavors. My husband had the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, which was outstanding, and I had the Dream Cone, which was loaded with Nutella and haunts my dreams to this day. The cones are not cheap, but the pure decadence is worth it (not to mention the fact that they are enormous). Not a great deal of sitting room inside, which is the only downside."}
{"text":"TL;DR Freshly baked dough cones sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon with vanilla soft serve topped with delicious sinful treats. 

These are so good! We got the Dream cone and it was ooey gooey goodness with chocolate drizzle, 2 chocolate brownie pieces, toffee bits and a lindor-like chocolate ball at the bottom! For a dessert this good, it's worth the wait or go on a weekday ;) 

Writing this review made my mouth water again!"}
{"text":"Let's start this off with one of my favourite weeknd songs: \"heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue\" - YASSS! SO MUCH YASSS. SO MUCH VEGAN YASSS. Yes!! Eva's got some vegan goodness up in hurrr.

We walked 40 min to get here (it was sunny out, and we wanted to walk instead of being in the stuffy subway with a gazillion strangers) and it was 100% worth all the blistery feet and sweaty foreheads. The store was really crowded and we were kinda out the door when we were lining up and it was so hot! The heat from the baking chimneys blew into our faces and it also smelled delicious. Mouthwatering af. There are so many options here (fruity, chocolately etc) & best of all - there's a vegan one which was light and delicious. I got the coconut cone (all their cones are 100% vegan) and the coconut whipped soft serve (BEST VEGAN OPTION EVARRR) It was topped with a strawberry and when I bit into the cone, I was on another high. It was SO DAMN GOOD. Crunchy, warm and soft at the same time. It was the best. I didn't even feel sick after eating it, even though it's so big. 

For regular cones, it comes plugged with chocolate so it doesn't leak - for the vegans, it comes plugged with a strawberry, which makes it a bit leaky and that's why I needed tons and tons of tissues, especially towards the end. 

It was so good though.
Ugh, this is goals. I'm so glad I don't live near here.. we'd be in trouble."}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype is all about. The ice cream itself isn't anything special..I guess you are mainly here for the cone. In terms of service...it's mainly teens standing around chitchatting and not wanting to even serve you. I asked for twist ice cream and got pure vanilla handed to me. So he had to redo it...but it was done so sloppy..I really don't think I'll ever return just because the service was such a turn off. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Tried Chimneys for the first time tonight at their food truck at Mississauga's Christmas/Holiday Market and left pretty disappointed.

The total wait time was around 45 minutes. If this was purely due to a long lineup and the cooking process, OK that's still acceptable, but disorganization definitely contributed to the long wait time. People who ordered after us received their chimneys before (while people who had ordered BEFORE us kept waiting as well). They should really switch from calling out names to a numbered system. 

There was a \"cashless\" sign that wasn't clearly visible until you got close - this could have been placed better. 

As for the chimney itself - I ordered the Chocolatey Golden Glazed (cane sugar + Nutella) for $8. It was tasty (can't go wrong with Nutella) but not that special - it was definitely expensive at $8 given that it's completely hollow. 

My friend had briefly lined up with us for Chimneys before switching her mind and lining up for churros. While the line-up appeared longer, she was able to get in line, order, receive, and eat her 3 stuffed churros for $5 while we waited for our orders."}
{"text":"So decadent! Ice cream is good, cone is good, size is large, options are good! Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. Staff and menu need to guide customers through the process, which should be simple but is just confusing at first glance. I'll give this fad a year before we see it closed for \"renovations\". Did I mention overpriced?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Canadian/US holiday weekend with a friend and my husband. We got the tiramisu and the berrybliss. Got there around 3pm on a Sunday and the wait was about 45 minutes. It was pretty cool being able to see how they make the cones through the window. 

Chimney cone - 3.5 stars reminds me of churros. Prefer it to be a little warmer. There is a chocolate ball in the bottom to prevent the ice cream from dripping everywhere. Unfortunately, there was a crack in my cone and the ice cream oozed out of there. 

Ice cream -2 stars. Nothing really special about the ice cream. Tiramisu was basically just vanilla ice cream with the coco powder on top and a couple small pieces of tiramisu cake in the middle. The berry one just tasted like chocolate ice cream with some berries in the middle.

This place was more for the photos"}
{"text":"Love this a lot! The chimneys are very big and expensive but I enjoyed mine immensely. It was very big I couldn't finish it.
M"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 20 minutes for a cone and they were not busy whatsoever. They kept taking new orders even though there were people before me waiting for their cones. Over 5 staff working but none were doing anything to help business. Two staff members were just wandering aimlessly not doing much of anything and then ran off to the back. There were over 5 cone shells cooked and ready yet they decided to use none of them. Overpriced, especially for the service."}
{"text":"When you browse through photos of Eva's chimney's it looks nothing short of amazing! The soft ice cream, the drizzle of chocolate, the fluffy cone. I found Eva's to be just OK. The soft serve vanilla ice cream was great but it was the cone that kind of was a downfall for me. It was too sugary and too hard. I thought it would have tasted differently as many others probably felt as well. I was expecting a soft more doughy cone and a funnel like cone experience. Eva's fell short for me however, I would probably return once in awhile. The price was also $10 and although I understand the logistics behind it I don't know if it is all worth the $10 or more!"}
{"text":"Ok the line up here...totally worth it!

Lots of amazing flavours and options for people with dietary restrictions including vegans. 

The chimneys tasted amazing! And the service was super friendly and fast! 

We got the coconut soft serve ice cream which isn't on the board but they do have it! So be sure to ask for it if you can't have dairy or just feel like giving it a try."}
{"text":"My sis and I came for a snack and each ordered a O.G. mini, which I believe was plenty. We both liked that the cinnamon cone was super fresh, quite warm when we got it. The ice cream tastes like normal self-serve, nothing special. I was worried about the ice cream melting to the bottom of the paper but to my surprise, I found a chocolate ball at the bottom! Quite a sweet way to complete a cone! Plus side, they offer vegan option too!!"}
{"text":"The permanent location on Bloor does not accept cash. They're also a little sassy about it. No, thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give a 4 stars for being original and unique.  I enjoyed the experience. It's a nice small place. Very busy but we managed to get a table. The cone was delicious.  The ice cream itself was plain but that way it didn't overpowered the flavour of the baked cone. Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh i died and went to heaven. You can see them make the cones and enjoy them at same time. Sooo cool. I just hope they extend this place. Its so hard to go all the way to downtown. But worth the trip. Try their green tea flavour. Its yummyyyy"}
{"text":"I have been passing by it everyday intrigued bythose freshly baked cones you can see through the window. And after weeks of fighting the sugar devil, I caved. 
Went it around 7ish it was pretty crowded with the sun scorching, everyone was there to get an ice cream in a churro. It smells heavenly, i think all that sugar, chocolate and the small coffee thing. It has tables to sit at the back of the shop as well as in the front. It can get slightly congested at times. 
I ordered the dream cone, with chocolate ice cream. A massive pile of chocolate ice cream in a warm sugary cone with two bars of brownies, nutella and caramel were handed to me. I took a bite and because i didnt envision what would follow started walking and in minutes my ice cream was melting, i stood and finished all i could while trying to salvage the flavor of the chimney cone. 
It is a delicious thing for someone with a sweet tooth. I would recommend sharing because its almost a meal and be smart and sit there because its going to get messy. 
If you have never had one of these, its worth the effort. I thought it was slightly overpriced at 9.95 +taxes but then there are days when you want an ice cream meal, this one is it. 
As for me, i would bring visitors for sure and come back for the hot dogs, but for chimney cones I think my craving is done, way too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Totally overpriced for what it is. I mean don't get me wrong the cones are fantastic. The ice cream itself is ok better than most places but not the best in the city. But $13 for an ice cream cone with a pastry as a cone is not the best thing in the world. It's one of the places you try for the hype but are not likely to return as a regular customer. Service and atmosphere are fantastic."}

SO creamy and tasty. It reminded me how much I missed soft serve. Although, I regret not checking out their Vegan option, which was a coconut milk soft serve when we were there.

[CLASSIC CINNAMON SUGAR CONE]
Watching them wrap the strip of donut around the cone into their \"chimneys\" is so rewarding. We opted for the simple cinnamon sugar cone so we wouldn't make such a mess. You can also add spreads like NUTELLA, JAM, CREAM CHEESE ICING, or WHIPPED CREAM. Dream big. But, since we were beginners, we just dreamt reasonably. The cone was so soft and tasty, but it was firm enough to bite into it without the ice cream spilling out. There are savory options, too!

They have a bunch of premade chimneys that come with toppings such as chocolate bars, nuts, etc. You can also make your own.

[MY FAVORITE PART]
Halfway through the cone, I talked about how my favorite part of the Nestle Drumstick is the hardened chocolate at the bottom. And lo and behold, there's a ball of chocolate at the bottom of their chimney cones (think Lindt chocolate). AMAZING.

P.S. You can get a mini chimney for a dollar cheaper but why bother! You'll finish it, trust me."}
{"text":"Must try! Come is sugary with the vanilla ice cream and apple chunks but it was good! Pricey for $12 but worthwhile. Recommend to share it with someone else."}
{"text":"I get excited everytime that they do a pop-up store at yorkdale. 
I find the main location a bit far to visit on my day off. 

Anyways my feelings stays the same. If i feel like eating soft serve cones. Eva is the first thing that pops into mind. 

I really like the apple crumble one (i hate the cinnamon donut cone but I typically exchange it to a different one). I also tried the matcha (4/5) flavoured when they did the 1st pop up store \"concept\" in yorkdale. Still the apple crumble one wins. 5/5

I also tracked them down at eaton centre too. I have a friend who's half hungarian and loves the hungarian donut. So i normally get him 1 or 2 then he'll add peanut butter or nutella in it. 5/5
(The staff there will give you a to go container.. always freshly made)

If it's still not to cold I wouldn't mind visiting the main location. 
Thanks for being always awesome."}
{"text":"I tried the dream cone from og chimneys. We waited over an hour in line but it was actually worth it. The cone was fresh and chewy, the ice cream and Nutella,toffee bits and brownie ratio was good too.  Would recommend this place and the cone we had!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto for a few days and saw a video of this place on Facebook. We decided to check it out but we're worried there would be a super long line based on other reviews. To our surprise there was no wait! (We went on a Friday afternoon in April 45 degrees so maybe that was why)

Apple pie donut cone ice cream: $9 CAD but so worth it! My boyfriend and I shared one but I wish I got my own! The apple pie filling paired perfectly with the cinnamon sugar outside. The donut had a crispy exterior and soft inside. Ice cream was soft serve- goes well with the donut!

Make sure to check their website to see where they are each day as it changes. Highly recommend if you get the chance. Also it's very Instagram friendly :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times and incredibly proud of it! Great place to take friends/family who are visiting or new to the city. 

Outside of their beautiful instagrammable ice cream concoctions, Eva's has great customer service. 

Their soft serve ice cream is SO GOOD. I mean like yes the toppings are good, blah blah blah but damn that soft serve is next level. 

It gets super busy, but the line usually moves pretty quickly. If you live in the city, I recommend coming M-F since S/S is usually when everyone from the burbs comes to grab these delicious treats."}
{"text":"I tried Eva's for the very first time at the Yorkdale Concept pop up shop. I tried the Matcha Crunch and it was flavourful, subtle, filling and so nice to look at  It was not too sweet at all which I was afraid of but I'm glad I got it. 

My brother got the dream cone and I tried a bit. If you like basic Nutella, get this one! It's delicious.

My boyfriend got the Decadent Drip Cake and it comes with a salted caramel macaron on top. HOW CUTE IS THAT? Definitely a splurge for this one because it was $15 for one! 

All cones come with a lindor chocolate at the bottom to stop the ice cream from dripping. GO GET YOU SOME!"}
{"text":"if you have a sweet tooth...check this place out!

This was my first time trying Eva's Original Chimneys cone and boy was I blown away! I'm a huge fan of tiramisu so it didn't take me long to decide on the cinnamon sugar cone with tiramisu! The cone was freshly made and the soft serve part actually tasted like real tiramisu. I liked how I could taste a hint of espresso after each bite. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"In one word - YUM.  Review over!

Kidding!  I don't think I can add much more than what other reviewers have added - located on Queen W this place from what I am told always has a line.  We must have been lucky b/c the day we were there there was no line - it was busy but luckily no line up out the door.

I had the original chimney (it's the only one that comes in a smaller size - I don't have a big sweet tooth so a hit of something small is all I need).   The best part here is that there is ice cream all the way to the bottom of the cone - they certainly don't skimp on anything - the cone is also like a fried dough cone...honestly just do yourself a favour and check it out.

This is the only place that I know that doesn't take cash.  There are some seats inside so you can enjoy your treats and the art work/murals are kinda cool and IG worthy :)"}
{"text":"I had my first taste of Eva's Original Chimneys when they were a food truck. I was excited to see that they had opened a brick-and-mortar shop. 

Came by on a Saturday night and there was a line out the door. It was a nice evening, though, and the line moved relatively quickly so it didn't really bother me. Plus, you can watch the employees making the cakes and cones while you wait in line. It smells AMAZING.

There were so many options on their menu, it was difficult to choose. Some of the options are quite decadent! The space where people stand in the lineup is quite narrow, so I didn't get a good look at the menu until it was my turn to order. I opted for the Berrylicious ($10), which has berry compote, strawberry drizzle, and a strawberry on top. It comes with chocolate soft serve but I asked for a vanilla substitution, which they were happy to do for me.

It was delicious, just like a strawberry sundae from my childhood - sugary and messy and dripping with strawberry syrup down the sides. The cone was crispy on the outside with sweet cinammon sugar and soft on the inside. The soft serve was quite good too, thick and creamy. There's also a Lindor truffle at the bottom of the cone to keep the ice cream from leaking out. 

For $10, it's a bit steep. A strawberry soft serve sundae is worth about $2-3, really. You're just paying for a novelty cone. That being said, for an occasional treat, it's worth it and I would go back again."}
{"text":"I had to have this before I left Toronto, and I must say that these ice cream were delicious! As you can tell, my boyfriend couldn't wait and ate his before I can capture his ice cream. We'll definitely come back for more when I'm around town!"}
{"text":"Ordered two OG Minis and overall it was ok. It was pricey for what is it. The soft serve was nothing special and pretty much the same quality as McDonalds. The chimney was alright but tasted a bit underdone and raw in parts. You basically come here to post on your Instagram and then never come back again."}
{"text":"Bomb.com, during my trip to Toronto my girlfriend and I saw a women walking away from the train station for one and Google this lively treat instantly. We got the the order vendor market and got into line. The line moved pretty fast for your average afternoon in the city. Although $10-12 dollars for a cones with toppings it was worth it. The portion was comparable to your average desert at a sit down restaurant and the quality was even better. Freshly prepared churro like cone with soft serve ice cream and toppings ranging from Nutella with salted caramel & chocolate sauce to a apple pie version. Will have to return next time I am in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Actually a 4.5

Thank God the line was not outside the door on Canada's Day (probably due to the rain) and that I was in and out within 15 minutes. 

Love the open kitchen concept 'cause I enjoyed watching the cones go in circles and just watching the make it lol. I also like how they take your name which makes picking up your order go by smoothly. 

I order the Canada Day 150 cone and Herb and Aged Cheddar Chimney Cone. I'm personally not a huge fan of vanilla soft serve which is why I stopped myself from coming into this place but the Canada Day 150 cone is a swirl of vanilla and raspberry sorbet topped off with a piece of strawberry and the cone is covered in dried raspberry. IT'S SO YUMMY!! The vanilla was surprisingly not too sweet and was very thick and creamy (didn't melt as fast as I thought it would) and the sweet and sourness from the raspberry complimented each other very well. If only they could keep the sorbets flavour year round! The price was $8 (mini) compared to $11 for the other full sized cones The Herb and Aged Cheddar came out piping hot and smelled just like pizza! It was a little salty but I didn't mind it. I would order it again, however for $8 it's a bit expensive. 

I would have given it a full 5 stars if they made the cones the same size. I ordered two Canada Day 150 cone (which were supposed to be mini cones) and one was bigger than the other (extra swirl) and my cousin who ordered the Dream Cone ($11 full size) was just as small as mine...

That being said, I think I will come back again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"My cousin took us here and I actually never heard of this place though I've seen photos of everyone's delicious ice cream cones on Instagram. There was a line so for us it was about 10 to 15 minute wait time. It's not too bad when you're with good company :)

I got a latte, my cousin got a drip coffee, and we shared the Berry Lemon Marscapone Tart. We got to mix in some raspberry sorbet when was their current special.

It was very refreshing and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't be a regular here but it's a fun dessert to share on an outing :)"}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try this near Union Station yesterday!! I got the berry one and it was amazing! The soft icecream, the rich chocolate, the berry sauce and the soft cone make an awesome combination for an awesome dessert! Definetly a must try !!!!!"}
{"text":"Located right next to union subway station at the front street food fair, this food tent makes chimney cakes filled with soft served icecream, filling or toppings:

Apple pie chimney cone - 5 stars - for $10, the icecream on top with apple filling inside of a chimney cone was deliciously blended well together to make a different treat.  The chimney cake is made to order, nice, warm and crispy, sprinkles with a sugar cinnamon mix, and a surprise chocolate caramel ball at the bottom of the cone.

Dream cone - 5 stars -  for $11, icecream with chocolate drizzle and two chocolate caramel brownies on each side in a chimney cake, with, of course, the chocolate caramel ball at the bottom of the cone. A very different delicious icecream treat!

The line gets long, but it goes fast, and they accept credit card!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that Toronto is a mecca for ice cream these days and Eva's Original Chimneys have found a way to hang with the best of them! I stopped in last night after walking by and seeing that there wasn't a huge wait for once. I was blown away by the different flavours and types they had and ended up going with the birthday confetti! What's cool is when you order and wait for your ice cream you can see every step taking place (I realize every ice cream shop is like this but not every ice cream shop offers warm chimneys as cones) Depending on how busy it is you might have to wait 5-10 minutes to get what you ordered but that doesn't even matter because when you take the first lick, life's problems fade away. After a brief wait I was handed my chimney and it was beautiful. The top of the ice cream is a small piece of cake with the ice cream, sprinkles, and chocolate fudge beneath it. When you get to the bottom (which won't take long) you are even treated with a truffle at the bottom of it! This place is going to be busy year round, but it's worth the wait, if you are looking for an A+ Cone/Chimney this is the place to come on Bloor!"}
{"text":"If someone asked me what was the best dessert you had all summer i would definitely say Eva's Orignal Chimneys. Usually things that are hyped up a lot always turn out to be a disappointment but this was not the case.

I was waiting all summer to try out Eva's and im so glad i got to try it !!! I opted for the original and added chocolate syrup to it. The pastry was perfect .... flakey , not too chewy with the perfect amount of sugar and cinnamon , the soft serve wasnt too sweet and was perfectly creamy !!! I loved the hidden truffle ball at the end of the cone added the perfect touch to finishing of the cone !!!"}
{"text":"Ice cream + Amazing churro-like cone? How can you go wrong? Well let me tell you. Eva's did not go wrong! No they did not. It was one of the best ice cream treats I've ever had in my life. Their menu had so many delicious mouthwatering options that I couldn't just pick one. I want it all! I was quickly eating the ice cream to get to the cone. Once I got to the cone, I just closed my eyes, let the crispy cone crackled into my mouth and accept the inevitable sugary-cinnamon crumbs fall they may may. So effing good!! I will for sure come back. Maybe even tomorrow. 

-keep eatin-"}
{"text":"BEST ICE CREAM!!!! The first time I tried it I shared a Dream cone with two friends because it was HUGE!! It was a warm curry cone with chocolate soft serve, brownie chunks on top, chocolate and caramel sauce, toffee bits, and a full Lindt chocolate at the bottom. Most cones cost around 11$ except for the original (churro cone, vanilla soft serve, strawberry on top, Lindt choc) Its the best thing you'll EVER Taste!!! The cone is the best part. You can watch them make fresh ones-- I found it cool how they had them up on the wall. Definitely worth the money and a MuST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"I love the chimney come at this place -- very unique and the thickness of the cone balances out the creaminess/ smoothness of the ice cream. Since I love green tea, I got the green tea ice cream and it was great. My cone was also very filling, and ended up being my dinner (not that I mind!). The line up unfortunately took half an hour but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I almost had two, but I felt like people would have judged me. 

My sweet tooth isn't as big as it once was, but I truly felt like a kid again here. Sticky fingers and all. (It was so good that I totally disregarded the spoons and napkins until I reached the bottom.) The service was super efficient and friendly and they have so many flavor options it's a little overwhelming (but in the best way.) I wish I lived in Toronto so I could just try them all."}
{"text":"I was so excited about Eva's coming into the neighbourhood that I had it scheduled in my calendar! This summer, I visited Eva's OG Chimneys at lunchtime during my last week in the Annex. My friend and I each had a mini cone ($6 for vanilla soft serve, their signature donut cone, a chocolate ball at the bottom, to keep the ice cream from melting out, and a strawberry on top.) 

If you have the slightest feeling that you won't be 100% in love with the toppings the whole way through, I highly recommend going for the mini. Note: it only comes in the \"original\" style. Based on the photos, the regular size looks way too decadent for one person to chow down and I imagine that most people don't finish their cones and toss them. 

The ice cream is surprisingly good and she made me a fresh cone (yay)! I had expected it to be soft and warm when in fact it had a tough outer shell (very churro-like).

Eva's does a good job at capitalizing on the novelty of the dessert - you can watch them make the chimney cones through the window and after walking past a dozen times, you start to want one.

My friend and I came after ordering lunch and I've got to say that the service wasn't the best. 
We felt rushed to order even though it wasn't very busy. If you plan on staying a while, there's a bit of seating at the back. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I wouldn't dissuade anyone from trying one of Eva's chimney stacks."}
{"text":"Really interesting flavours and presentation! There are a lot of ice cream shops popping up everywhere but this is unique. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"It is so much fun to watch them make the chimneys. The line is long, but it moves fairly quickly.  While you wait in line, you can watch the workers make the chimneys through the window.  They have the menu and pictures displayed around the store.

There are two sizes and I ordered the OG mini cone.  After a day of eating, going with the regular size looked like a bad idea.  It is vanilla soft serve drizzled in chocolate.  At the bottom of the cone, they have a chocolate ball to stop the soft serve from dripping out the other end.  

Overall the experience was the best part of visiting Eva's.  The line to order is organized, but waiting for the cone can be hectic.  The inside can get packed and it can be difficult to hear the workers call out the orders. When I went, they did not accept cash and were card only.  The prices are on the higher side, even for the mini but the mini is a good size."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Couldn't wait to try this place after seeing all the media hype. I didn't want to ommit to a large one though so I ordered the mini chimney cone 

O.G. Mini Chimney Cone with vanilla ice cream
Cinnamon/sugar
Toppings: Peanut butter & pretzel

I should have gotten a drizzle too because the peanut butter was actually inside the cone and the vanilla ice cream could have used something on top"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent! That was one delicious treat! The chimney was so fresh and was rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Filled with ice cream and Nutella, pieces of toffee, and at the bottom of the cone I was surprised by a chocolate truffle. I'm obsessed now."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this is a must eat in Toronto. I came here when the weather was wet and cold, yet there was still a 40 minute line! The cone combined with the ice cream make this a delightful treat! They make their belgium cones daily while you stand in line. 
11/10 recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone's been talking about these Chimney cones, so I just knew I had to try it.

The truck was parked at the Brickworks on a lovely Satuday afternoon, and the lineup was insanely long. We're troupers, though, so we waited a full hour to order our cones and then we waited another half hour for them to be ready.

I ordered the Dream Cone, which comes with Nutella, butter toffee bits, organic cocoa drizzle, and a homemade salted caramel brownie. It's quite a concoction, but is it delicious? Not quite.

The ice cream is just so-so, while the toppings are too subtle to really make much of an impact. No, the draw here is that cone. But unfortunately, it's just not that great. It tastes kind of like a churro, although it's much harder than any churro I've ever eaten. Honestly, if it had been a little softer (or breadier, for lack of an actual word), I might've enjoyed it more.

I'll admit the whole thing did grow on me as I kept eating it, particularly as I got closer to the middle where all the Nutella was hiding. Seriously, Nutella makes everything delicious.

It's a decent dessert, but I definitely wouldn't recommend waiting 90 minutes to eat one of these things."}
{"text":"So my brother, neighbour and i heard about this place a while back and wanted to try it out. Man this place was dooopeee!! The cone itself was a donut which you can customize to be anything! 

The menu has a lot of options, you can choose the ice cream cones that are popular or you have the option to create your own which is what I did. What i got was a cinnamon sugar cone with nutella spread inside the cone...yeah then I got a chocolate vanilla twist cuz why not get both. The sauce I got on top was a mint chocolate sauce with brownies.

It sounds way sweeter than it is, you have to give this place a try it's so different and unique. The total came out to about $11.15 which is a lot for ice cream but you have to look at what you're getting here it's literally so cool so the price didn't bother me plus the brownies were super soft.

There wasnt so much sitting room considering the lineup which was going out the door almost but i didnt really care because i was focused on the ice ceeam. Customer service was SUPER GOOD the cashier had a great sense of humour and was so nice and helpful cuz it was my first time there. overall all of you gotta come here if you're ever in the 6ix it's LIT."}
{"text":"I was extremely lucky there was no line (well there was a snow storm at the time lol). I went with my boyfriend after work and this was the only thing I was looking forward to. 
We got to the store and the worker was very kind asking if it was our first time there. They explained the cones and how to order and after playing the ini mini miny mo we finally came to a conclusion haha.. 
We got the raspberry cheesecake cone (about $11~13 a cone) and it arrived in our hands within 5 mins!! 
Took some pictures and then devoured :) probably would be able to have one cone per person."}
{"text":"Finally tried one after seeing tons of pictures and rave reviews on Instagram. They did not disappoint! Got the apple pie and my better half had the berrylicious with Nutella lining the cone. It also has a berry compote, but he passed on the berries and enjoyed the Nutella with ice cream instead. Dough is soft but firm and covered in cinnamon sugar. Reid's soft serve ice cream is creamy and rich. Loved the Lindt chocolate ball at the bottom of the cone to keep the ice cream from dripping through. A very rich, VERY sweet, very filling ice cream treat/desert. Found it a bit too pricey, but would still recommend it as something you have to try."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. I love this place so much and wish they could make a calorie free version that tasted the same so I could indulge every day. I find the regular cones to be way too big, so I like to get a mini og with raspberry sauce. Delish! Of the fancier cones that I've tried I think the apple pie and the raspberry cheesecake are the best. I don't love the graham cone, but everything with a cinnamon cone has been excellent. I love that this place is cashless, and I love all of the little touches like the tiny wooden spoon tucked into the paper and the wet wipes at the counter. The line moves pretty quick and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, their Donut cone is revolutionary. 
Great job, a must try in the city."}
{"text":"I like the idea how it's cashless . Kinda prevents theft on a business perspective. The cashier was patient and very informative about what cone has what in it. Got the banoffee pie and it was delicious"}
{"text":"My wife and I found a small market by accident and decided to stop and check it out while we were in Toronto, best decision ever!!! 

This ice-cream come was made out of cinnamon doughnut, and was so good! Inside the cone was Nutella and at the bottom was a chocolate truffle. The cone was filled with soft serve ice-cream and had a berry sauce that was sweet and so damn good.

You haven't lived until you tried one of these!"}
{"text":"I had to see what the rave was about & compared to other hit locations for ice cream this did not disappoint. However, I wouldn't say it was worth the money but definitely worth the experience. 

I got the lemon raspberry mascarpone chimney cone ($9.95). The size of the cone was good enough to share between two people. The soft serve ice cream wasn't anything special, but it was good & didn't melt too quickly. The star of the ice cream here is definitely the cone, as expected. It was freshly made with a sugar coating. The cone was warm & not too sweet. It provided a good balance between the ice cream and the cone. There was also layers of graham crackers coated around the cone and between the soft serve ice cream, which was a pleasant surprise. When it comes to the syrup that goes on the soft serve, there definitely isn't enough. The bottom of the cone was gross, a thick piece of unpleasant dark chocolate."}
{"text":"The donuts are very filling but overall it's really good. It's very sugary and probably a once a month sort of desert but nevertheless I enjoyed the cones. Pricing is a little on the more expensive side as it was $11 a donut cone but the size is also pretty large. On the contrary to the other reviews, there wasn't really a line when my friend and I got there at around 2pm on a Thursday. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"No complaints with Eva's Chimneys but be prepared for a lineup. Trust me it's totally worth it. 

First time I tried Eva's was at last years Sweetery Festival but this time around I got to try their limited edition Canada 150 mini cone (Available until July 2nd). This was amazing at a price of $9.00 including taxes it was a tasty treat. The mini cone is just the right size to enjoy this sweet treat, the cone is coated in dehydrated raspberries and filled with raspberry sorbet mixed with vanilla soft serve then topped with a strawberry. It was the perfect combination. 

There are regular sizes and mini cones available plus a lot of different options to choose from. Plus there are vegan options which is great so everyone can enjoy a yummy treat. 

Service was lovely as well. The lady at the counter was friendly, answered our questions and made it an enjoyable experience despite the lines. There is seating and washrooms available at the back of the shop but it's limited seating. Chimneys are definitely worth trying out and it's also great for sharing with friends or your significant other."}
{"text":"Fresh made and delicious cones. It's expensive though and the shop is small so it's a wait sometimes. The ice cream is soft serve, nothing exceptional. People love coming for the social media pics of cones but I don't think it's worth the price, $8 about for each."}
{"text":"I've tried chimneys at a Christmas market I was at in Austria but I've never had it with ice cream, so I was interested to try to latest craze. In the end, I feel like the execution of the concept had let me down.

Staff: The place seemed a bit chaotic and the staff seem to be part of the reason for that. They don't seem to fulfill orders in the order they were placed which means some people had long waits while others got their orders almost instantaneously. They should really find a better way to call out orders since you can't really hear them in the back when it is busy.

Ambience: There's definitely a bottleneck with the layout of the restaurant. Plus there's no proper place for people to stand when waiting for their order so it can get very crowded. I lucked out a found seats in the limited seating area. On the plus side, they had free water.

Food: I liked the chimney, but the ice cream was not that great in my opinion. I had the apple crumble which helped bring flavour to the bland ice cream. But the worst part is that the flavours aren't mixed with the ice cream, so you have to get through the bland ice cream at the top to get to the actual topping flavours. The food looked nice though.

Overall, I'd probably come back to get a chimney to go next time but that's only if I'm really craving it. Otherwise I'd look for another place for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow I just loved eating their ice cream! Sooo other than paying like 11 bucks for it, this was easily one of the tastiest and rich ice cream I've had. Once think the ice cream is finished when you eat all the vanilla outside you have way more chocolate brownie on the inside (a treat within a treat). Solid place to go on a date and would easily recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"1.5hr line but worth the wait! Freshly made and met the mother of the owner while in line. Great service, and they'll do great in expanding all over Toronto!"}
{"text":"We went to the popup store in Yorkdale. This one had a line up. We waited for 30 min just to try out their ice cream and the special cone. However, I don't think its worth the line up. Its nice to try new things and their food aren't bad."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed this place.  The ice cream and the special cones they make are amazing.  I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Toronto"}
{"text":"I got the OG mini cone, which is just a smaller version of their original cone with chocolate or vanilla soft serve. I got vanilla and my friend got chocolate- both great! 

I really have no complaints; the service was fast and friendly and the cone tasted great! I like the surprise chocolate at the bottom hehe a great way to finish. 

I will say that the portion size is pretty big, so the mini is a great way to try it and not waste anything or feel sick by the end. 

I would love to come back and try one of their more exciting flavours!"}
{"text":"I visited this place during my weekend trip to Toronto, and I was definitely excited because the pictures of the cone reminded me of a churro ice cream. I liked it so much that I visited it twice during my trip. 

When we got to the place, the line was about 5-6 people, which wasn't terrible. We had to wait around 7 minutes to get served, and I got a chimney, which was called the OG mini. The soft serve was amazing, and it surprised me when I first bit into it. It was just the right amount of creamy, and it tasted high quality. The cone itself was also great. It tasted like a churro, but harder in texture which was great because you'd get a satisfying crunch every time you bite it. 

The OG mini, although smaller than the regular size, was enough to make me very full after a regular sized dinner. There was also a chocolate ball at the end of the cone, which admittedly was my least favorite part of the cone. The chocolate did not seem like it was high quality. 

The second time I tried it, I got a regular sized raspberry chimney. This was also great, and very flavorful. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who would want great, innovative ice cream in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Doughnut cone ice cream!! We got Apple pie, dream cone (Nutella, caramel, brownies etc), berrylicious. My favorite is still the apple pie. They have a chocolate ball at the bottom of the cone. They then add the filling (e.g. Apple pie filling) and ice cream + toppings. It's quite filling so I had to share. Fun for summer. They regularly add new combinations and flavours so check it out."}
{"text":"Went to the Pickering food truck festival and had to get myself one of these chimney cones after seeing them everywhere on social media. The ice cream tasted great and the cone was unique but to be honest I was a little disappointed. Partially because I also had to wait in line for at least an hour so I was expecting something worth it. Nonetheless, the flavours in the dream come were great! Especially the butter toffee bits inside. The cone itself was a little hard for me in terms of texture but still tasted great with the cinnamon."}
{"text":"Visited Eva's Original Chimneys a handful of times since they are at #unionsummer all summer long!

I have tried the dream cone and Eva's apple pie... the dream cone is hands down the best! A delicious warm cinnamon sugar churro cone lined with Nutella, filled with ice cream and toffee bits.. topped off with brownie, caramel and chocolate sauce... heaven!

While these things cost as much as a meal, they are definitely as filling as one too! The truffle at the end is a genius idea to prevent melted ice cream to go through the cone and is a sweet surprise.. definitely taking cheat day to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and thankfully it was one of the only dessert places still open. The interior is really cool - cones hanging on the wall, huge Eva's sign lit up and bench bars. My friends and I got the matcha crunch ($9.75), thai mango sticky rice ($9.75) and the peanut butter pretzel parfait ($9.75). Honestly, I was a little disappointed at the matcha crunch because of the lack of matcha. It literally just had matcha drizzle and the matcha kit kat BUT if you're into something a little less extra, I think this would be a good choice. The sticky rice was probably the best out of the three because not only did it look good but the taste was up to par with its presentation. I'm pretty sure it's only one size but the cones were huge and if you don't eat them fast enough it does tend to get really messy so prepare for that!"}
{"text":"\"Chimneys?  We don't need no stinking Chimneys!!!\"

Oh how wrong I was!   Walking around Wonderland today there was a small food truck festival and this particular food truck was killing it as they seemed to be the most popular.  At first I didn't think it was worth it but some of the creations that were coming out of that truck really intrigued me but completely hooked my wife towards it so off she went to buy some as nothing in the universe can stop a woman who has a sweet tooth! 

Baked Hungarian Chimney cones are all the range on Instagram and Facebook these days as EVERYONE who ordered one deftly tried to figgit around with their camera phone as quickly as possible before the cone melted or worse fell over. 

We ended up with the \"Dream Cone\" which was the baked Hungarian Chimney covered with Nutella, butter toffee, cocoa, salted caramel brownie and filled with Reid's soft serve ice cream with a chocolate truffle in the bottom.

I have to say, even though I don't have a sweet tooth it was the bomb!  The chimney was similar to churro/donut and all the flavours combined beautifully.

It is expensive at $10 a pop but I can see why they charge that much as a single Chimney can easily feed 2.  

With the popularity of this food truck I can see them expanding to more trucks in the future.  Definitely up to try some of their other flavours.  

More Chimneys please!"}
{"text":"Okay, so ever since this place opened... I have been intrigued. I can't help it, they seriously pull you in with that big window of theirs, allowing you to view employees rolling, dipping and drying the chimney cones. Looks pretty great from the outside and smells even greater from the inside.

We went here as a treat for our mom for  Mothers' day. There was a line up. And I can't fully say it was worth it... because it's not gourmet ice cream, it's soft serve, which is disappointing. But it was something new and exciting to try especially in the 'hood. 

I got the Lemon Meringue one. Their lemon chip was tasty... Their cones are also tasty... very doughy and definitely fresh. I would love to have tried a savoury cone with the ice cream, unfortunately this is not an option. 

I didn't like that in order to clog the bottom of the cone, to prevent the ice cream from dripping out, they stuff a Lindor chocolate in there. Yes, Lindor is delicious, creamy and rich, but it was sweetness overload what with the ice cream, the cone and the toppings all also having sugar. This is similar to the Drumsticks that have chocolate at the bottom of the cones. And in my opinion would've been a nice touch if it was dark chocolate instead, to offset the sweetness and have the bitter antioxidant goodness of  this treat enhanced.

I'd go again to try a savoury item."}
{"text":"One of the biggest crazes in Canadian food truck scene - chimney cone! My husband came across the chimneys as street eats while working in Prague this past winter. He had shown me pictures and attempted to describe to me how tasty and unique they were. Although he had promised to take me along and try it when next trip calls, I was excited to learn that the chimneys had made its name across the continent - no need to wait anymore! 

My husband and I shared their Berrylicious (stuffed with berry compote, Nutella spread, and vanilla soft serve!). Berry compote - not overwhelming sweet or sour, loaded with distinguishable berries! Nutella - generous spread but not a mouthful. Vanilla soft serve - smooth and silky, the perfect textural contrast to the crunchy yet chewy, warm, cinnamon, brown sugar coated chimney cone! The best part? Unlike another cinnamon/brown sugar coated sweet - churros which are deep fried, the chimney was not one bit greasy! We didn't feel grossed out after devouring the monstrous sweet treat by ourselves! 

Overall - a must try if you come across!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite ice cream places in Toronto. You get to choose what toppings you want, and the type of cone you want it with. 

The size of these things are huge. The ice-cream itself wasn't that special, but the cone was delicious, and it comes with a little surprise in the middle. I got the Lemon Strawberry one - super fruity awesome for the summer. The golden glaze cone was crispy and fluffy.

It comes with a tiny spatula that comes in handy when you want to eat it out of the cone. Wet wipes are available beside the cash."}
{"text":"The Ice cream:
Solid - generic soft-serve from a Taylor ice cream machine. Truth be told McDonald's has better soft serve - but you ain't going here to eat the soft-serve. 

The cone / chimney:
Made in front of your eyes, dough swirled together and cooked over a rotisserie! Perfectly balanced of crunchiness and chewiness. 

The experience:
The cone is hot, the ice cream is cold, this bad boy will look pretty a solid 30 seconds for you to take a photo to post on Instagram to showoff to all your friends. After that, its every man for themselves - in terms of getting napkins. Left with at least 4 chocolate drip stains on my clothes (and on the clothes of other people beside me). 9$-11$ for an ice cream is a lot of money - but labour is expensive, and renovations are even more so.

Verdict:
This place has all the tell tale signs of being the next hipster joint. They do things unconventionally, are featured on BlogTo and even Breakfast Television. They are also rebels and trendsetters by not accepting cash. Who could ask for more? 3/5, extra star given for the gimmicks."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Eva's Chimneys. I usually end up here when I crave for a delicious desert for dinner. The quantity is huge"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I don't like soft serve ice cream, and I didn't really like it here either, but the cones were delicious.
Definitely pricey (~7 for a cone, ~10+ for a cone and ice cream), and probably won't come back, but it was a nice one time experience as it was warm and cozy and smelled like heaven."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Every time I come here I am not only impressed by the delicious food but the customer service and general happiness of the people working here really make me want to come back again and again. The cones are delicious, the cone itself is always sweet and tasty. The ice cream is soft serve and is incredibly good too! You can add your own toppings for 1 dollar each or just get a set cone that comes with pre determined toppings. I absolutely love this place and come pretty much every time I come to Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Came here when the mini egg cone was being hyped. The cone was too deep fried, almost too hard to bite. Would've complained but it was so crazy busy. 
Churros are not meant to be rock hard. Would've had a different feel to this place if I had the perfect churro cone. 
The choice of topping and ice cream was amazing though! Must try."}
{"text":"First tried this dessert place out during a food festival. Waited 2 hours to get the dessert. Ordered the berrylicious ($9) and the dream cone ($10). The berrylicious one was delicious it was not overly sweet. Had the standard vanilla ice cream on top of a sugar cinnamon cone filled with berry sauce and Nutella. The cone is one of the best cones I've tried. My boyfriend had the dream cone. It was a sugar cinnamon cone filled with Nutella and toffee bits topped with chocolate syrup and brownies. He did not like the toffee bits and said it was too sweet. Sugar overdose. Long wait but totally worth it in my opinion. 


They finally opened a store, no more need to stalk their food truck!! Came to the dessert shop with a friend. There are 16 different cones you can choose from and some coffee and teas. I got the funfetti party cake ($10) . My friend got the tiramisu ($11). A little more expensive than the food trucks. 

My funfetti party cake was not that great. I found it too sweet and the ice cream was just too much. It was chocolate twist ice cream topped with chocolate syrup on a plain cone filled with chocolate and sprinkles. The basic chocolate twist nothing special. The plain cone was horrible. There was barely any taste to it. It felt harder then the sugar cinnamon cone I had before. And the sprinkles and chocolate was really hard and took a lot of effort to chewy. Disappointed that it wasn't filled with Nutella. Would not recommend this flavour. 

My friend had the tiramisu. He loved it. Though it lacked tiramisu powder on top. He said it was delicious. As you eat deeper down the cone there's a hidden chocolate ball in this one. The cone was the sugar cinnamon coated one. He loved the cone, the ice cream not so much.  

ICE CREAM IS AVERAGE, CONES ARE DELICIOUS!

I'd say avoid getting the plain cones. The best thing about this place is their sugar cinnamon cones. They are absolutely delicious! Would recommended the berrylicious as it was my best experience. 

They have a water station. Were you can get cups of water because the ice cream may be too sweet. 

Oh and this place is totally Instagram worthy!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely on the higher end of ice cream.  I think the original is like $11 and going up from there.  But it's quality  that you're paying for as well as the positive experience. 

I got the s'mores one and I forgot what my partner got but they were yummy. Hot and fresh and basically ready to order. Eating it is quite a mess but what ice cream cone isn't. 


I think the owner said they have a vegan option as well. I was too distracted by my cone to focus but be sure to ask. 
Most definitely not a place I'd go every time I want a fine but for sure a place I'd treat myself once in a yellow moon."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about these \"chimney stack cones\" I had to try it out. Here's the verdict: the cones are unique, they resemble a cross between a puff pastry and a Pillsbury croissant. I like that they are made fresh to order and that they come with different topping options. The ice cream itself tastes just like McDonald soft serve. You're paying 10$ an ice cream strictly for the novelty of it but as far as taste goes, it did not live up to the expectation. Please be advised that it is also not a nut free facility nor can they provide it free options (everything is fried in the same oil and the man handling the cones also handles the nut toppings with the same scoops and gloves). It is also a cash-free establishment (thought that was interesting)."}
{"text":"Expensive but delicious. We split the Dream Cone. The salted caramel brownies were amazing. The hidden layers in the cone were a nice surprise (I think a layer of nuts and Nutella near the bottom). The combination of everything was perfect and I loved how the cone was still warm while we were eating."}
{"text":"We got the \"team coco\" and \"funfetti party cake\". Both $10 each. The service was incredibly fast and they even gave us the cone while we were seated! Typical soft serve but the cones were so tasty and fresh. We also didn't expect the cones to be layered with icecream and coconut flakes/cake inside. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Fabulous,and delicious chimney cones!! my first time trying their famous chimney cone, and I tried the tiramisu cone. At first I could only taste cocoa powdered vanilla ice cream do, it was good but I didn't think it was $11 worth, but oh.my.goodness. under the ice cream they had mascarpone spread and coffee soaked lady finger bits. It was heavenly! I'm a huge tiramisu fan eva's tiramisu cone filled my satisfaction. Would definately go back to try their other cones"}
{"text":"Had the strawberry compote ice cream chimney. Just delicious! The ice cream was really good quality, and the very compote and surprise chocolate plug at the bottom of the cone we delicious. Will be back again."}
{"text":"When I found out these cones are coming to Toronto, I almost lost my marbles. I first had them in Prague (without the ice cream) and have been dying to eat then again. 

I didn't want to wait an hour to get them, not to say they are not worth the wait, I'm just a really impatient person. So when they back the truck up at Union station, I thought, this might work. After 15 mins of wait at 9pm, I had one of the best ice cream cone in Toronto, hands down. The cone was so soft a moist, the ice cream was delish and the strawberry was the perfect cherry on the top. Go get yourself one ASAP!

Tip: you have to eat it to the end. There's a surprise at the bottom of the cone!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the ice cream @ogchimneys and I am clearly in the minority - did not like it. Couldn't finish it. Found the cone dry and the ice cream bland and icy. Lucky that I decided to order the small, plain cone for $6. Getting the fancy ones and regular size would have been a total waste. Pretty pricey for what you get. A regular cone will cost you $11. 

Definitely don't get the hype. But clearly many people love it."}
{"text":"A fabulous and unique way to eat ice cream. The donut cone is light and sweet. I am not a big donut fan but this Cone was fabulous. I had the Berrilicious in a cinnamon/sugar cone. A must do for everyone."}
{"text":"Just a warning before you come, they don't take cash and seating is limited. 

The dessert however, is awesome. There are a variety of different flavors of ice cream you can try and all come with special toppings. We got the tiramisu flavor and there were actual pieces of tiramisu cake inside. The soft serve is served in a fried dough cone with a crunchy exterior and soft interior. The soft serve also is topped with espresso powder which makes the flavor jump out. Once you get to the bottom of the cone, there is a tiny chocolate ball which is also quite good. 

This place is great and you should definitely try it out. Prices are around $11 for the soft serve + cone but they give you a lot."}
{"text":"Love the whole ice cream experience even it was a long line up, because they made it in front of me while I was lining up, they kept us entertained.  

The freshly baked cones move along the process line at the same speed as I do, by the time I get my order, I got those cones that I saw outside the window.  It's cool that the cone is that fresh! 

It was almost 12am at night and it's still crowded, I like the vibe, this is what it should be as a dessert place.  

I tried the original cone, it's delicious! The ice cream is soft and smooth, the cone is crispy outside with cinnamon sugar, it's soft inside with nice texture.  They hand it over to you, provide a wooden mini spoon, and lots of hand wipes.  I'm surprised I didn't need any as the whole design is so neat that not one drop of ice cream came out! 

It's a must try dessert in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I get the hype and long queues forming in front of the shop, a very good marketing attempt behind it with free in store Wifi too. I was caught up and went in while it was not crowded - and yes there actually are times where there is no queue. 

The cones are mouthwatering, warm churros sprinkled with sugar And a sauce floating down to your hands through the cones. I ordered a smaller cone and yes they have such an option, just ask the cashier during your order. I found the cones overly sweet for example. Couldn't finish it. The ice cream is actually a cream, not having above average taste. 

The calories for one regulate ice cream goes up to 400-700kcal...so be careful on what you order here. I do think think it's really worth the hype. The regular cones are 9$ and smaller ones are 6$ if I'm not mistaken. Give it a go I would say because it is original, but keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place, they are vegan friendly as well! I got the apple pie chimney cone and it was spectacular; chunks of cinnamon apples, vanilla soft serve, cinnamon sugar chimney cone, and salted caramel on the top! They have the regular size (like the one in the picture) and a smaller size. There are so many flavor combos to try, and they have a monthly flavor as well. The place also smells amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing varieties of ice cream flavours! Visited this location on Bloor & the line-up was unreal! One of the best things about this place is that you can see the employees making the cones in front of your eyes (it's a good way to distract you from being in the line-up). Would visit again but it will be a treat for me as cones are appx $11 (yikes!!)"}
{"text":"This place was rammed on a Fri. night in Feb. so the line will definitely go down Bloor St. in the summer! I had the OG and really the original chimney is a great introduction to this dessert. The soft serve was creamy and no artificial taste whatsoever and the dough of the chimney was wonderfully chewy yet soft. I'm definitely coming back to try some of the other variations. Service was pretty efficient considering the line went out the door but the employees behind the counter were struggling to keep up. Rhett definitely didn't design the place for the numbers who were waiting and the delivery needs to be more stream lined (some kind of assembly line method might help move things along). They ask you for your name when you place the order but then some servers were calling it out once the ice cream was ready but others weren't causing some chaos. As long as you're prepared for the crowds, you'll enjoy the final product."}
{"text":"My household, and indeed my whole family, are always on the hunt for new/interesting treats and so the murmur of a new kind of ice cream cone sent us scrambling for information and headed to Eva's. 

Unlike other reviewers, we did not experience any line at all (to be fair, it was 4:30om on a snowy Monday when we went) and the service was great and courteous and very patient as 7yo changed his mind one bazillion times about what he wanted.  We eventually managed to order and pay, and after a surprisingly short time we're handed $11 ice cream cones packed with chunks and swirls and heaped with ice cream. 

They were DELICIOUS. Messy, and almost overwhelmingly big, but really tasty. Flavors well balanced, everything super fresh, and they put a big honking truffle in the bottom of the \"chimney\" so you're not promptly coated in ice cream (you'll get there, just takes a little longer this way - look for the giant bowl of wet naps at the end of the counter). They happily showed my kids how the chimneys were made and cooked even after we'd already ordered and eaten. Probably because it was a slow afternoon, but still. 

Also, the washroom situation is great- there's a properly large-sized wheelchair accessible all-gender washroom with a push-button door that's wide enough for most power chairs and also contains a change table for babies. As someone who sometimes needs one or more of those things in a venue for dessert, I really value this."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try this at the Front Street Foods at Union Station. Since this is a food truck, and they move to multiple locations from time to time, hunting this down can be a challenge so it's best to check beforehand!  

I tried the Original Chimney Cone and it was delicious! The ice cream was swirled in this beautiful doughnut cone coated in sugar. The vanilla ice cream was smooth but the doughnut at first bite, was a little hard. But as you eat through it, the cone is a little softer. At the bottom of the cone was a lindt ball of chocolate which was a nice touch. 

There was a continuous long line up to get this - I waited for about 15+ minutes. It was a bit expensive for ice cream ($9 CAD) but it was worth the try if you love desserts. I would definitely have this again as a lovely treat!"}
{"text":"Was reluctant to try this, as my first time trying Eva's Original was when it was still a food truck at Evergreen Bricks. I didn't really enjoy it as the cone was harder than I thought it'd be. 

The wait time was pretty long, not only was the line up long but they did run into technical difficulties when their internet didn't work. A couple ahead of me left because it was so long, luckily it was a nice day out so I didn't mind waiting outside for however long.

I was pleased to find out that not only are the cones softer and compliment the ice cream a lot better, but there were a bunch of new and unique flavours! I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake - if you love cheesecake this is the one for you! It's sooo good! My friend got the funfetti party one which was good too but I'm not a huge fan of chocolate (unless it's white chocolate lol) so I don't think I enjoyed it as much as she did.. considering she obliterated it by the time we got back to our car LOL! 

There's ice cream until the very last bite of the donut cone, which is awesome! We have those moments where we order ice cream and at the end you're left work a plain ol' cone ?! Yup, won't have those moments here! 

It does seem slightly smaller than I remembered, but still roughly same price as I paid last time. 

I definitely recommend if you are in the area and want to try something new! Expect a long line up though as I waited almost an hour for this. Oh and no cash! They only accept debit, credit or Apple Pay."}
{"text":"I'm already planning my second visit! I absolutely love their chimney cones! We had the dream cone which is cinnamon coated churro cone with vanilla soft serve with 2 brownies on the side. It was amazing! We waited in line for about 15 mins but we arrived pretty early after dinner around 630-7pm. It was a good thing we went early because the line got so much longer a couple mins after we got there. But I think the wait is worth it. I am so excited to try other flavors next time!"}
{"text":"This has been on many Toronto dessert and Ice cream list and FINALLY I got to try it.  I was trying to figure out if it's still a place where people just line out the door .. and oh dear lawd, yes it was.  Even at 30+C inside, we had the line spill out onto the sidewalk and clog the area.  Eva put the Gardiner at the Lake Shore merger to shame  ... yea you know which off ramp mess I'm talking about.  

Was it worth the 20 minute wait we had at Saturday evening... I think so!  What did it have going for it? Welll let's see. Novelty catch ... Yup, soft dough crisped and fired up and covered with sugar.  Tons of crazy toppings that you dont normally see on Ice Cream ... Uh Huh, the Funfetti Party Cake cone looks like a 3 year birthday party exploded and drizzled on vanilla.  A thousand people instagramming their cones ... absolutely.  

To the stores credit, they hustled and had at least 8 people working in the store.  It was busy but they kept the line moving reasonably well.  They had 2 people constantly rolling the dough and making the cones.  They had 2 people working the cone cooking area, another 2 taking orders, and 2 more just making the cones.  It was a constant flurry and seeing how they had some people who asked a billion silly questions at the cashier (I overheard one less observant person ask if they can have their choice on a regular waffle cone and if they made those), the staff here was constantly pleasant.

There are a ton of choices ... everything from a fruit mix (berry) to some seriously over the top decadence (dream cone where you get brownies, nutella, butter toffee, and cocoa drizzle).  You can go for a smaller cone for a $1 less but .. honestly, you gotta choose something over the top ... otherwise, you might as well headed to the golden arches.

I got the Maple Pecan Cinnamon Bun to celebrate the Canada 150 even though they had a small raspberry dusted cone as a Canadian special.  What can I say... a true Canadian bleeds maple.  So at first when I got it in my hand, I was wondering if it worth the $11 as it didnt seem to have a lot of topping at first.  I'm comparing this to the amazing Roselle desserts for the same price.  

The cone was cool to the touch (thank god cause I cant imagine the vanilla flood that would happen) and was crusted with so much caramelized sugar and cinnamon. The ice cream wasn't as towering as some instagram I've seen but thats ok cause it is a filling dessert.  It had just a tiny bit of maple syrup drizzle and two bits of maple pecan.  To get to the good stuff, you need to eat past a lot of regular vanilla soft serve to get to more of the maple pecan clusters.  The cone reminds me of a decent cinnamon bun.  When you put everything together, I can totally see the appeal and why its so loved.  It's a great sticky mess than has a novel but fun cone and some interesting combinations you don't see elsewhere.  A 4 star cause it's just fun ... flavour wise, it was solid but it was missing the \"oh wow that's really good\" flavour pop.  Nothing at a Roselle level but then again, you came here for an instagrammable sugar coma and Eva delivers on that."}
{"text":"To start off with we didn't go to the one at Bloor but @ the pop-up store @ Yorkdale shopping center. This pop-up had also Uncle Tetsu Japanese Cheesecake and Pi Tarts! Only there until end of April 2018.

We've been to the cheesecake and tried the tart but Eva's Original ice cream in cone chimneys was to die for. You can get different flavors like Oreo but we tried tiramisu.Wow no words literally you can say as you try stuffing this down. If you don't want to go down to Bloor street at their main eatery then try it here!

Just an fyi, Uncle Tetsu now has egg tarts..Yummy. but at this popup they only bake it every Monday..nice..I guess you can tell that I have a sweet tooth which explains why we didn't try Pi Tart which was more like a meal...oh well :) TIP: you can try their fan fav Dream cone from Eva with egg tarts from Uncle Tetsu. Judgement: you'll feel great but you will need to run 25km to remove all that calories gained...eat this on cheat day."}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about ice cream however the ice creams were enticing and I just had to try them. It was really good, but then again for $10-$12 a pop you'd expect it to be the best ice cream you've eaten. I'd definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"You gotta come here on your cheat day!
Came here on Friday evening, but no line ups. 
I got the one they recommended which was very chocolaty (can't remember the name), and was so satisfying. 
I have to say one cone is a bit much for one person, and it will make you feel sick afterwards. 
BUT, it's all worth it :)
If you are an ice cream lover, you gotta try!
I would probably share one with a friend next time I go!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were walking past this place headed to El Furniture Warehouse and we agreed we will be stopping by on our way back to the car. We waited in sort of a long line, but when we got to order it was the quickest service ever! We couldn't decide for a while but we did end up getting the Maple pecan cinnamon bun, it was about 11$ I believe, if you ever get a chance to go please get it because it was really tasty! It had a cinnamon sugar cone with chopped candied pecans, more cinnamon sugar, vanilla ice cream and drizzled with maple syrup and topped with a whole candied pecan. When ever we are back in the area we will definitely stop by again. If your craving something sweat, this treat will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place for dessert! There's endless options to choose from and your sweet tooth will not be disappointed. The chimney cakes are made fresh with the option to choose from the menu or build your own chimney cake!"}
{"text":"I like that it's made fresh & that there's a variety of different flavours. I also appreciate that they layer whatever the flavour is in the cone, so it's not just on top and it breaks up the soft serve nicely. The only drawbacks are the intense lineup in the summer, and that they're cashless, otherwise it's awesome !"}
{"text":"After a yoga class and walking pass Eva several times I knew I wanted to see what it is all about!  Finally, Friday came and I dragged a friend with me to come try it out 

Walking in, you certainly smell the warmth and delicious smell of bread and sweetness.  Hungary was the theme, a couple flags painted on the wall, street sign, photos of Budapest and little trinkets (brass ware in a hutch and plates close to the ceiling) dressed this venue.

On the menu there were several basics starting at $7 and then those with ice cream and dressings were upward to $12.  I tried the O.G. in a walnut come which was basically a Lindt ball at the bottom filled with vanilla frozen yogurt in a pastry cone dressed with sugar and walnut.  What a simple delight .  This was a cheat meal, wishing there was a gluten free version (killed my stomach after and this morning but it was worth it)!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, the lineup for this place is huge. We originally thought it was the El Furni, but nope, it's for the fresh Chimney cakes and cones. You can see them make it through the store front and there's so many options to choose from. We got both a Chimney cake and cone to share and I can't say I prefer one over the other because they're just both so good. 

Is the line worth it? I'd say yes, in nice weather and with a less than a 45 minute wait. Otherwise, grab some dinner/coffee and come back at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Great dessert in a great location. So many interesting options to go for now. If you're not feeling adventurous, go for their normal soft serve. I grabbed the thai mango sticky rice and it was delicious. There's actual sticky rice inside the cone with chunks of mango. It's definitely to share though since it's so huge. The cone was delicious and covered in desiccated coconut. They have build your own options but if there's a long line, don't take so long to decide. There's adequate seating in the back but it's usually messy."}
{"text":"I've been waiting patiently to try this ice cream experience since it's opened on Bloor. Today was the day and wow this was everything I hoped for and more. There's a menu of quite a few different options to go with. What you need to know is the cone the ice cream is put in is a DONUT covered in either glaze, or cinnamon or a different topping. Then there's a chocolate truffle at the bottom. Then soft serve ice cream with toppings then more ice cream. It's quite a masterpiece. 
The staff is super friendly and helpful. Since it was my first time I was open to suggestions and they were able to help. I ordered and my ice cream was ready in just a minute. It was so quick especially since they had a line out the door. 
This place lives up to the hype. Go here be happy."}
{"text":"Regular ice cream, right?! NOT AT ALL! Freshly fried pastry covered by sugar and cinnamon. Filled with Nutella AND berry jam... Oh... There is ace cream on top! And a strawberry to make you smile! 

Have fun!!!

Totally worth taking the line and wait a few minutes."}
{"text":"My husband and I got the \"Og\" it was delicious!! The cone was on point not to sugary just perfect"}
{"text":"Eva's was at the Food Truck Festival Ontario  and  its been on my list for a while. I saw a very short line and saw my chance to enjoy a chimney without having to wait for ages.
From what I could see  looking at the truck the Cones  are baked into shape and  mixed with cinnamon  and then toppings and soft serve are added inside the chimney . I went with the mini Berrylicious Chimney  which was a chimney filled with softserve and berry compote and topped with a rasberry coulis.  It tasted great. Its one thing to have a berry soft serve in a cone or cup but the chimney with cane sugar and cinnamon adds more dimensions to the berry flavour.   Ill  end this by saying I look forward to trying out more chimney cones but in  mini  size since I  prefer to snack on many small desserts instead of one big one .
Also  while waiting in line with his girlfriend  a man dropped his chimney and  the staff at Eva's were very kind enough to offer him a new one  on the house. Thats excellent customer service  right there . Keep it up Eva Team !!!"}
{"text":"At first the price for the cone can be a little daunting. You may think to yourself \"$11 for an ice cream cone? Does this come with superpowers?\" But I promise you, each bite and taste of the ice cream cones offered at this shop is worth every penny of the price. Not only is it a surprise with each layer of the cone, but it truly is the cone that keeps giving. It's delicious and definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"This place is a little overrated. The ice cream is not so different from ice cream truck, the cone is what makes it unique but it's really just a deep fried dough. 

The place is also a bit small and there isn't enough space to sit. 

All in all there's much better ice cream places but it's definitely unique if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"I brought my three kids in on the weekend to enjoy some ice cream. I loved that Evas was coming to my area. I even was a part of their online competition to create new flavors. I brought my kids there and ordered the ice cream. Kids are licking their lips. I go to pay with cash...Sorry sir we don't accept cash. You don't accept cash? So i had to walk out with my 3 kids with nothing. How can you possibly say that is to any benefit to the consumer to not accept cash? I read on the website that it's for hygiene purposes and to benefit the consumer. Does your front counter staff not touch the debit and credit cards? only after searching through your site ( it doesn't say cashless anywhere when your walking into the restaurant) at the very bottom of the MENU does it refer to it being a cashless business. I was disappointed that the  business made a decision only to benefit them (stealing employees) and not the consumer. But more so because my kids have no idea about all of that stuff and they just weren't able to get the cones they were asking about all weekend.

***UPDATE***

I received a very nice message from the Owner Kristin. She offered to rectify the situation and i appreciate that very much. That's all you can really ask of a business if you have an issue. I still disagree with the no cash policy but Owner Kristin did right by my kids and that's great to me. thank you Kristin"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand the love for these. They are incredibly messy and difficult to eat."}
{"text":"we ate these chimneys in Concept store in Yorkdale. dough is nice but whole dessert seems very plain for the high price and is super messy to eat. the chocolate on the bottom is a nice touch but I've had a lot better chocolate too. selection is okay. not sure I'd be back for these prices, you gotta cash out for the novelty. I wouldn't not recommend someone to go and try for themselves though."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

Of course what they are known for - their ultttimmate chimeny cones!! I really like the chimney it comes in which is their breadlike cone. Freshly baked in house and made right in front of your eyes. Sprinked with either walnuts, cinnamon, nuts, corn flakes or whatever you desire I bet if you ask them. I had the X-treme cone and I really liked how they put ice cream and then in between the ice cream, they add more toppings so that you don't have just toppings on top, you also have toppings in the middle. I really like the sweet and salty twist in a cone, that's why I ordered it! But the cones come with a hefty price tag. For their specialty cones, they range from over $10 so be prepared to pay quite a bit for this cone. I say it's shareable with a friend or two. If you can handle one cone yourself, you sure have enough quota in your calorie intake! ;) I personally love soft serve ice cream so having soft serve ice cream in the cone was great to share with a friend!

LAST TIP?

If you're not a fan of their soft serve ice cream, and you want to save a bit of money or you just have a craving for the chimney cone, you can opt to try the chimney cone on its own and you can sprinkle it with what you want in your cone!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a ice cream spot in the late evening the other night and this was literally 1/2 of the only ones open until 11pm. I think more dessert joints downtown toronto should be open later. Anywho! The line up was out the door but it was okay we got to watch how they make the pastries while we waited. It's cool that you get to see it all happen from start to finish. The guy at the cash was really helpful and super patient with everyone (i think he should get paid top dollar for his work since he's what sells the dessert to people all on his own!). I asked for the party cone thing without the sponge so basically mixed ice cream with sprinkles. I liked it a lot. You shouldn't have dinner and then come here though. It's like a meal all on it's own! I also think its kind of pricey but i'll pay top dollar for some good looking ice cream!"}
{"text":"Damn delicious and excellent soft serve. The cone is crispy and soft with the perfect level of cinnamon and sugar. I found the apple compote a bit too sweet for my liking but the caramel sauce is incredible. They should cool down the cones or make the ice cream super cold so it stay solid in the hot cone - this stuff melts faster than frosty when he's left in the greenhouse in that movie I may or may not have cried at when I was 10."}
{"text":"for about a year and a half I've been patiently waiting to try these, absolutely, positively, full of sugar bliss Treats. I made an effort to \"stalk\" them out, actively tracking them over the course of the last summer was not fun to say the least, both opportunities I had, were met with doom! fast forward to this year, and the announcement that they would be at union station, everyday for the whole summer! I thought PERFECT, 3 months of summer, and lots of opportunity, to come and try these out. we took the go train straight into union station, and I'll be completely honest I was trotting the whole way through the station, I was PUMPED to say the least. I was slightly confused as to where they were in the set-up of the market, but I didn't have to look very hard, as this was the booth with the longest line up. I was slightly disappointed at the size of the line up, and the kid inside of me thought \"THIS IS GOING TO TAKE FOREVERRRRRRRRRRR\". the line up moved almost as fast as any fast paced coffee shop, much to my delight, you have to pay first and then they call your name out. so I was thinking to myself, ok lets see how long this actually takes. less then five minutes from time of order to cones in our hands(an order of 3 different cones) the moment one of the cones hit my tongue, it was pure bliss, like instantly all of my troubles, and worries, and fears just exploded and nothing else mattered, I wouldn't be lying if I said eating this dessert put me in an out of state body experience, time slowed down, people slowed down, I could hear my heart beat over everything else. to say that these cones are nothing short of orgasmic would be selling these treats grossly short. after almost being brought to my knees in pure joy, I was left completely satisfied, happy, and high on sugar. was it worth 1.5 years of wait? yes... was it worth the trip Yes... is it worth every penny? YES!(they could totally charge more imho)
IF you ever get a chance to check these little cones of heaven, I highly suggest it, as it is my favorite dessert, period! I anticipate the announcement of the return of this wonderful establishment to the union market. 
awesome to come here by yourself, or on a date, or with anyone! 
perfect little treat to boost your day, or end it!
one of my highest recommendations!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Finally had the chance to try this and I'm sure glad we did. Although there will most likely be a line, it's worth the wait. Right when you walk in you can smell all those chimney cones being baked at the front of the house and then placed along the wall to cool before being served. 

While we waited in line, we skimmed the menu. Every cone looked so decadent and yummy that it was hard to make a decision. I ended up getting the Thai Mango Sticky Rice (which is one of their vegan options). The soft serve was drizzled with mango sauce at the top. As I kept taking bites I uncovered more treats along the way: mango chunks, along with coconut sticky rice near the bottom. The coconut cone was definitely the star though. Still warm, the dough was so yummy and sweetened slightly with coconut flakes. The last bite also uncovered a small round chocolate wedged at the bottom of the cone. 

My boyfriend got White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake which was also great. Although we both agreed that my cone was better :) . From what I could tell, the OG was a really popular choice. 

They aren't cheap, $11 per cone, but eating them made me feel like a kid again which is priceless."}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT 

(If there is a line) 

I had the 'very berry' in a cinnamon sugar cone w/ vanilla soft serve , and ... it changed my life . The cone was soft and crispy , and the workers kept the line moving quick . The space is tight , but whatever ! The food makes up for maybe having to eat outside .  

Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"It was a freezing night but we had to try this place. Thankfully the line was not long and we got served quickly. There cone is made out of freshly baked bread. They also some coffees to go with the pastries but we only tried there bread and ice cream. It definitely met my expectation. Bread was soft and was a good pair with the ice cream. 

A must place to try when in toronto!"}
{"text":"We went to the Yorkdale pop up location and tried the green tea Chimney cone. The cone pastry itself was delicious and paired well with the soft serve ice cream. It was a generous portion and innovative idea, but for a very expensive price of $7. To me, the ice cream was similar to Mcdonald's Mcflurry with green tea Kit Kat blended into it. I liked the concept and the cone was very fresh and soft with cinnamon coating, which was a nice touch. I would only try this cone once though for its novelty."}
