{"text":"We were coming a long way, so I phoned a few days ahead to check to see if there was anything I could eat that was GF and veg for me, and veg for my husband for Saturday brunch.    Their regular menu looks interesting, but brunch, not so much.   The lady who took my call went to talk to the chef, and she assured me that they could accommodate my needs and substitute whatever I needed, so I made the reservation.  We were offered coffee that came in a bodum, which is cool, but it didn't have much taste, unlike what we know most pressed coffee to have.   Later we discovered we had been charged $12.00 for this which is mind-boggling.  The restaurant is pretty and the lighting is interesting.   However, in this room, the noise reverberates in an odd way, and it suddenly felt as if we were in a room with shouting people all around.   This was very unpleasant and we would have like to have left on the sooner side, but our meals took more than an hour to arrive.   (pancakes,  and eggs with polenta and sausage).   Our waitress quietly said sorry when the food finally arrived,  offering no further explanation.    The food was pretty, edible, but really not that flavorful.    The plate of fruit that they offer each table at the beginning of each meal was the best part."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best places in Montreal! If you're looking for something a little fancier with delicious food, excellent service and a welcoming atmosphere, look no further!

Everything I've had the opportunity to try was excellent and if I have one thing to recommend, then I would definitely recommend the lobster! And I'm not even a lobster eater!

As for the dessert, if you're looking for something a little lighter, then the lava cake, with it's coffee froth is the perfect dessert. However, if you have a bit more room, then the deconstructed carrot cake is an experience that you won't want to miss out on!

Give this place a try, I bet you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried the 'Scallop Fish & Chips' and 'Lobster a l'Américaine' both were delicious, seafood was super fresh and the presentations was lovely! However, the service was SOOOO slow- I know it's a new restaurant so I'm hoping this is the reason. (We had to wait 20-30 minutes for someone to even ask if we wanted drinks!) Their bread is apparently freshly baked on site and is served with their home lemon-thyme butter (if I'm not mistaken). Bread was great but again, we waited 1 hour to be served bread? Let's hope Hopkins steps its serving game up because the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal and experience at long-anticipated Restaurant Hopkins! Everything was great from service, to drinks (I had some sort of amazing lemonade/ice tea cocktail), the menus, service, decor, and of course the food. I would 100% recommend the infamous duck platter, marrow with jus, and anything else they'd recommend. Also really good bread!"}
{"text":"I recently returned to Hopkins & was pleasantly surprised! The service and food my 2nd time was much better (my original rating was 3/5..now a 4/5). My friend and I sat the bar and started with delicious cocktails (I ordered a type of old fashioned which was good) and decided to do the 3-course tasting menu. We opted out of getting the wine pairing but had a glass w our main dish. The food was beautifully presented and delicious! I especially liked the tuna tataki & cornish hen. The tasting menu changes regularly & if you have strong preferences they will accommodate eg I mentioned I don't like rabbit & they opted out of that for my tasting. The only downside was that the portions are probably not big enough if you have a large appetite. If you are very hungry opt for the 5-course. For me the 3 course w a dessert after was perfect. So, I gave this restaurant a second chance and was happy I did!!"}
{"text":"We had one of the most incredible restaurant experiences here tonight. The manager was extremely personable and attentive and really helped make the experience. The food was unique and delicious - I highly recommend the red snapper!"}
{"text":"This is a tale of two reviews. The first review is of the service which was outstanding. 5 stars easily. The waitress and manager were awesome, the food, however, was not. 

This isn't to say it was all bad, because it wasn't. We initially ordered the tasting menu, having tried outstanding tasting menus at hoogan at beaufort and hvor, we were prepared to be surprised. The first course was the charcuterie which was ok. It was a tad salty and one note for my taste but some may appreciate it. The next dish was a fancy tuna salad that was, in a word, tasteless. It was one note, my dinner companion was less then impressed. The next course was the deal breaker, being a scallop course, again without any flavour or taste. We normally wouldn't say anything but decided to let the waitress know. The manager came by and did all that he could to make us happy, which we appreciated. We \"restarted\" and allowed us to pick from the shareable list to end the meal. The grilled octopus was ok. The duck ravioli was very yummy (best dish) and the final savoury course was the seared eye of round, which was a nicely cooked piece of meat and the pure reminded me of the one I had at park. We ended on the fondant cake which was yummy. 

I'm undecided about a return but I wouldn't do the tasting menu but the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Quite a memorable meal!  Upscale cuisine in a classy yet comfortable setting.  We got things started with cocktails (I had the Bloody Caesar, with its delicious homemade bacon bites), followed by a nice portion of the refreshing Wellington beef tartare, bone marrow crème brulée atop wonderful duck magret, duck raviolis and scallop ''fish and chips'', both dishes bathing in divine sauces (all of the sauces were divine, actually), and finished it all with a true star, the lobster à l'américaine, butter poached to perfection...  With professional and welcoming service, there is really nothing more we could have asked for..."}
{"text":"What a wonderful Monkland neighbourhood dining experience. 
Didn't have to go downtown, uptown , all around this messed  up city for a dynamic creative elegant foodie experience. Charming servers, ( Laurent ). Beautifully designed space: intimate but feels roomy and expansive.  A great cohesive branding, colour and design experience. I enjoyed everything I ate, I want to sample  each dish. The portions were just enough to sample several plates. The scallop plate, a favourite was large enough to share. Worth dressing up for but it's a casual elegance that makes it feel like a boutique hotel restaurant. I walked home with a great buzzed feeling. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant I've been to for a long time. Service was impeccable. Portions are small, but it's quality that counts here. We started off with cocktails at the bar...all recommendations from Sébastien who made us welcome. We went for the five course tasting menu + chosen glass of wine for each course from our Waiter, which is the way to go. The Duck Ravioli was the winner of the night. I would definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"I had heard very positive comments about this new arrival and was looking forward to an interesting brunch experience. I must, unfortunately, say that I was very disappointed. 
After departing I asked myself, was the whole experience worth the $100 that we spent for 2? The answer was a definite NO.
The staff were working very hard and were trying their best. Somehow I felt that they were somewhat disorganized and wondered if there was anyone really in control. It took a long time for someone to come take our order and the fruit plate which accompanies brunch orders was served first to customers who arrived after us.
We both had the eggs which were acceptable but nothing exceptional. The plate was copious and served with two BIG THICK slabs of grilled bread that had not taste but smelt burnt. I asked for salt and was given an espresso cup with salt in the bottom. I thought it odd.
Perhaps the acoustic is designed so that the room be loud so that customers not feel relaxed and are subliminally enticed to leave their tables and not linger too long.  Wow... it was loud for such a small place.
The decor is interesting (?) but there is a fine line between minimalism and boring.
I realize that this review is not at all reflective of others which appear here on Yelp but this place just didn't do it for me. I won't be going back even though I live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.Packed place and I needed to go out to eat after I ate there.Service was good Nice staff but portions miniscule.I understand the sharing concept but give us enough to share.The roasted root vegetables were good and actually fairly generous.The 2 small duck raviolis were tough.The wild boar should have never been caught. That was so small ,one bite each. To really feel satisfied at this restaurant one would have to order the entire menu.As it was the bill came to $120 with a glass of wine (small) and a cocktail. Value very poor."}
{"text":"This upscale restaurant just opened its doors in NDG and offers a refined menu in an elegantly decorated space; with a little fine tuning in service this venue will be a great addition to Monkland Village which lacked a fine dining experience. We tried the scallop, polenta, and corn, as well as the duck magret, bone marrow with jus: everything was just delicious! The wine list was a great discovery as well."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews I was excited to try this place.  Unfortunately our experience was sorely disappointing.  My first drink was a tequila cherry old fashioned that tasted like they forgot the old fashioned and gave me straight tequila.  The bone marrow creme brûlée was delicious but cold.  The octopus and duck ravioli were fine.  The scallop fish and chips tasted soggy and undercooked.  The service was incredibly slow and honestly we felt like as \"normal people\" we were treated as second class citizens - often taking 15-20 mins before clearing our plates or asking if we needed another drink.  For a $80 / per person meal I expect much much more."}
{"text":"Les premiers plats étaient assez bons: carpaccio de cerf et tartare de thon. Le plateau de charcuterie était bien. 
C'est pas la suite que nous avons été déçus: l'assiette de vivaneau poêlé était bien sauf le poisson qui était trop cuit et par conséquent très sec. La bouillabaisse était franchement ratée: la purée était beaucoup trop salée, le homard trop cuit et les 2 moules que j'ai mangées n'avaient pas été nettoyées correctement. Le \"jardin de légumes \" était correct. Quant au ravioli de canard, c'était vraiment intéressant comme plat mais encore une fois très salé, et le ravioli que j'ai mangé n'avait pas un jaune coulant, contrairement aux autres. 

Carte des vins ok, sans surprises. 
Le service était correct, un peu trop familier. Notre serveuse était insistante sur le nombre de plats à prendre et au final on a trop commandé. 

J'ai peut-être l'air pointilleuse ou difficile, mais au prix des plats on est en droit de s'attendre à mieux. Peut être que c'était une mauvaise journée dans la cuisine, mais ça ne donne pas envie d'y retourner."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch and it was incredible!!! The fried chicken and the pancakes were to die for... I can't wait to go there again."}
{"text":"I went there this Saturday service was  great menu is very well set up but when I received my order it was a bit salty for me the bacon and the beans so I didn't really enjoy eating but the place looks very nice though the decor and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Hopkins with high expectations. The service was excellent and very accommodating but the 5 course tasting menu left much to desire. Of the 5 courses only the meat dish, eye of round was satisfying otherwise everything was boring with zero wow factor. Surprised that they would give us a tuna salad ( simple, nothing special ) and then Scallop ( a disappointment ) instead of maybe their much raved about duck ravioli. So maybe the sharing menu is the way to go at Hopkins but our group will likely not go back to find out. For 80$ I think the chef should put some better options with more variety in there. So I would suggest you Avoid the tasting menu and choose your own food. We got none of the foods shown in Yelp photos !"}
{"text":"Had an intimate dinner here. Service is spot on, knowledgable and friendly cant ask for more. Upon going to hopkins i had my eye on the marrow flan, interesting idea, questions in mind on how it would be serve warm or cold? What would it taste like? So we ordered it and answered my questions. But sadly it just didnt work for me. It was just weird. Savory flan with smoked duck. The duck was great, the flan was ok. Together, it wasnt too appetizing. 

Had the duck for 2 with plate of roasted veg. This was the star. 
Ravioli with duck confit and yolk. Sexy. 
Confit leg, lacked the crispy skin, but tasty. 
Fried wing, best part 
Smoked breast good. 
Seared breast ok. (Least fav) 
Served with more roasted veggie and puree 

All in all good experience."}
{"text":"I had dinner on Saturday night and this restaurant is one of the best restaurants I have been to. The tasting menu was imaginative and delicious. The staff was efficient and knowledge about the menu and the preparation of the different food items. The restaurant design is exceptional and has a great vibe. Do not miss this restaurant if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 and instead of putting four I'm giving them a five due to the service was really good at correcting their mistakes.

The food is really good and innovative. A bit on the pricey side of things but they certainly made up for it in service. The first time a waiter/ress came to clean the baby's tray in the middle of dinner. 

My fav dish was the octopus!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night wit my boyfriend. We sat at the bar. It was packed and we just walked in without reservations. We were lucky to get a seat. 

The decor is nice. It's fancy! The ceiling is a mirror and behind the bar there's coral-like  decorations.

The bartender looks like Sam from game of thrones lol. I ordered a bloody Caesar and it was very good!! I then had the pisco sour which was good but I definitely preferred the Caesar. I also had a gin tonic with cucumber. 

We shared three plates. The beef Wellington tartare which consists of AAA beef tartare, poultry mousse, duck prosciutto and sauteed wild mushrooms. We also had the bone marrow creme brulee which consists of bone marrow flan, smoked duck magret and crust duck skin and veal juice. It wasn't sweet if you were wondering. Lastly we shared the duck ravioli. The portion was small but I loved the sauce. I was dipping my bread in it so I guess I filled up that way. We didn't get dessert.

I would come back for more drinks or try their other dishes especially since it is close to my condo. The service was good and fast and the food was tasty! I'm happy there's more good restos now on Monkland!!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of the restaurant scene in Montreal, you become very aware of the wonderful chefs that do great work in our city. When I hear about new restaurant openings through social media and online, most of the time I have heard about the chef in charge and where they have been before. You create an expectation for yourself based on what you know from their previous work. Every once in a while though, a place pops up surprisingly on scene without any foreshadowing and makes a mark. In less than a year, Hopkins would definitely make that list.

Since opening last summer, Hopkins has received great reviews across the board for Chef Liam Hopkins' cuisine. They also received great marks for their brunch service so I made my way over on a Sunday morning with my sister for another episode of brother sister brunch.

Located in Monkland Village - a part of town that I have generally ignored for no obvious reason, Hopkins is quite a looker. The space has a clear modern chic style. Seating is either caramel-coloured chairs or pearl grey banquettes. The back of the room's focal point is a gorgeous mirror-backed bar covered in orange candles. Lighting is provided by brass chandeliers but the tall windows in the front provided tons of natural light for a brunch service. Add some great music with very friendly and attentive wait staff - even when they say upfront that they are new - and Hopkins definitely plays the part of a fine dining establishment.

Even though it was 11am on a Sunday, I still went with a cocktail because it's brunch and it's socially acceptable to have a drink as a result... right? Anyway, I went one of their seasonal cocktails, the Tennessee Sour - Gentlemen Jack, dried peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg white, bitters and nutmeg. Nicely balanced - a touch of smokiness from the Jack but very fresh and creamy. Great start.

The brunch menu is not huge but everything was quite interesting - it took much longer for both of us to decide what to pick! Regardless you are presented at your arrival with a plate of fruits and jam with fresh brioche bread. My sister went with the house smoked salmon served on ficelle served with crème fraîche, pickled red onion, avocado, radish, niçoise and split tomato vinaigrette. Beautiful presentation and very good to boot. The smoked salmon had a great texture and very flavourful. The rest of the dish was very fresh and light.

I went with the breakfast sandwich - a buttermilk biscuit with egg, cheddar, house Beaurivage bacon and crispy polenta hash on the side. This sandwich was insane - first I love a good buttermilk biscuit and this one was excellent. Combination of egg, cheese and bacon is always a good combo but when the house bacon is thick cut... eve better. The side of polenta hash was very interesting and pretty good - the little bites of polenta were crunchy on the outside but tender inside. A great dish all around.

Hopkins nailed it from start to end - great decor, great service and excellent food. NDG is not a regular location for me food wise but Hopkins has ensured that I need to come back more often..... now to try dinner!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great experience from the moment we walked in. Impeccable service.  Cool 60's decor.  Creative cocktails and incredible tasting menu.  Deserts were also spectacular.  Thanks for the recommendation Lorne.  Bravo Hopkins!"}
{"text":"Effectivement tres cher ... indrediants de qualité , assiettes pas trop flayés mais quand meme des petites portions , preparez votre budget et vous aller satisfaire votre gourmandise ;) j'aime les lumieres tamisées, deco et music retro."}
