{"text":"At the outset, excellent service - very frequent and attentive, but not disingenuous or perfunctory.  As a group of 6, we ordered various dishes to sample:  - one whole chicken: excellent; tender and moist - one whole Uncle Ray's Seoul Brother Fried Chicken: tender and moist with some spice and kick  - Truck Stop sandwich: decent hot chicken sandwich entree; open face pulled chicken sandwich with gravy and peas; the gravy is really heavy on the black pepper; the bread is thicker than Texas Toast (but not toasted) and the chicken was tender; though I like peas, they didn't do anything for me for this dish - Lightning Chicken plate: super spicy battered chicken on thick bread; for spicy food fans, this takes it up a notch and can clear your sinuses; tons of batter, but otherwise the chicken is again nice and tender and moist  - Butter Lettuce Salad: excellent salad; great complimentary flavours with the rich dressing and good serving size  - Poutine (Triple Cooked Fries): average; cheese curds and gravy were sparse and could have used more - Spit Fired Sweet Potato: excellent side of 4 small servings; very soft and gently sweet;  - Mikey's Southern Coleslaw: nice side, good portion size; not too creamy and subtle flavours  Triple chocolate brownie: chocolate brownie with chocolate sauce and chocolate ice cream that's excellent for the chocolate lover; the brownie was nice and fresh and the ice cream was great; loved everything except for the sprinkled salt  The mains and sides came in skillets and I liked how they provided small tongs to everyone for easy sharing.  All in all, decent food and excellent service - great first impression."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat in Sherway Mall, my BFF and I decided upon U.C.  Upon entering we were greeted pleasantly and were promptly seated.  The servers are polite.  The first thing I noticed though were the water glasses ... rim side down on the bare table.  And whom is the health inspector in this area?? Anyways onto the food. I ordered the O.G sandwich, which was probably the only item that really stood out.  Temperature hot, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside ... Perfect.  My BFF had the Truck Stop sandwich.  Chicken was too peppery, NOT temperature hot, and not a good \"thick bread\" to chicken ratio.  As a side we tried the Spit Fire sweet potato.  The fire wasn't there, looked microwaved, and the sour cream should perhaps be on the side, so it won't cool down the already room temp. sweet potatos ... OR even better, change to sweet potato fries.  Next side, the butter lettuce salad with ranch dressing.  A definite miss.  Water still on the leaves, mix that in with sliced avocado & cucumber ... a soggy disaster.   Our beverages were the Lavender Mule ... Prominent lavender flavor for sure & a draught beer. I will give U.C. another try in the future, and we'll see if the owner(s) take yelp reviews to heart."}
{"text":"what a different approach to wholesome takeout. I went a few days ago to give it a try, chicken was tasty! however a bit pricey to feed a family of 4. I guess you could say a new look to an already growing market of churracuiras in the city. Unique side dishes, Organic chicken, and interesting menu. definitely a place to try. Considering going back to try the restaurant menu and eat there."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday as I go by all the time when I'm in the mall.  Personally, I found it to be an overpriced Swiss Chalet.  $10 for a piece of chicken, and sides that start at $6.  You can at least throw in a tiny side of coleslaw.  Salads were tiny and $9.  The triple cooked fries were great, the chicken was just meh.  I would probably try it again, but for the price will likely just go to the Keg on the other side of the mall."}
{"text":"Chicken was raw! Sent it back a second time. Still raw! Was told it's because it was organic which makes no sense. Manager insisted that it was cooked even after noticing the red juices and raw meat. Organic or not. That's raw meat. Was also told it was killed 10days ago! Whole foods wouldn't even sell you chicken that old!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after seeing a BlogTO article. Union Chicken prides themselves for sourcing and using only organic, free-range chickens from Ontario farmers. That being said, don't expect to see giant sized portions on your plate. Free-range chickens are notably smaller with a denser, less fatty meat. Their quarter rotisserie chicken comes with a small pitcher of sauce that instantly reminds me of Swiss Chalet sauce. The chicken was good enough that it didn't need any sauce though.   Buttermilk fried chicken was the bomb!!! Totally didn't want to share this after first bite but, you know have to when husband (and child!) are also foodies. Drizzled with maple-honey syrup and gravy, we asked for the hot sauce on the side so the little guy could eat it hot-free. It comes with two thighs, each cut in half. I kind of wished this wasn't free-range chicken just so it could be larger portioned, but that would defeat the purpose of the restaurant.   Since the chicken comes on its own, you need to order the sides separately. Crispy brussels sprouts are good, although heavy on the ranch dressing and chili gastrique. Fire roasted broccoli has a serious helping of aged white cheddar sauce and fried garlic. I personally like my veggies with less sauce but for those of you who like it, this one is for you! Tomato and Harissa fried rice has a strong tomato flavour with just a hint of heat from pecorino.   We made it this far and couldn't pass up on dessert. Sticky toffee pudding it is! This was served with a rather unique ice cream - cinnamon brown sugar. You'd think all of this combined would be a sugar explosion but I was happily surprised that it wasn't! It's sweet of course, but not overly sweet like some other sticky toffee puddings I've had in the past. I'd come back here just for this and some drinks!   Overall, a very good meal although a bit on the pricey side. Would definitely come again, but likely more for special occasions due to cost."}
{"text":"Cool spot in the back of the mall.  The chicken and waffles and rotisserie chicken were pretty good as were the Brussel sprouts and roasted sweet potato.  Prices seemed appropriate for the quality and volume of food and the atmosphere was very nice.   Service was terrible!!!  We went for dinner but they must have had the lunch staff on shift when we came. Our waitress literally took away our plates at each course while we were still chewing our last forkful of food. We felt very rushed even though the place was less than half full. They even took away my Prosecco before it was finished.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"The Lightening Hot sandwich is over the top delicious, but it's not nearly as yummy as the brussels sprouts (and I hate brussels sprouts). eTo die for. I was there right after opening, and like most new places they had some service issues (result in our table getting two orders of the sprouts) but it's all great service now."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Friday evening and got seats right away. I think we were able to beat the rush because it became very busy soon after. It's a nice addition to the Sherway area. I would say this is now my favourite restaurant in the mall. They serve organic free range chicken from local farms and this actually makes a huge difference in taste and quality. We order fried chicken, rotisserie chicken, fries, quinoa and spinach salad and white cheddar biscuits. Everything tasted awesome! I know people have commented that it is a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for. They use high quality ingredients, the food is cooked perfectly, the service is great and it's located in a mall - every food place in a mall is a bit more pricey than places with low rent."}
{"text":"For the price, there are far better restaurants in the area to patronize. The value for your money is extremely low and the food quality is okay, but doesn't warrant the price.  The Japanese hot fried chicken at the CNE is way tastier at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was surprised not to see more people than there were. This place is underneath union station so it may not have as much foot traffic as it needs to attract the larger crowds.   I ordered the chicken sandwich which I was told is the most popular item on the menu. It was tasty. Chicken was nice and crisp and there was a nice combination of flavours.   I also ordered the biscuits as a side but felt they weren't really flakey enough on the outside nor fluffy enough on the inside. But hey, it's not called \"union biscuit\"  I liked the interior a lot and thought the combination of bar and table space would be great for a party. Hope I can go again soon."}
{"text":"Great chicken. The rotisserie chicken and fried chicken are both extremely well done. Has that true southern taste to the food.   The portions are very generous and the place is clean and ambience is great. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I saw this place on a blogTO list for \"Best Fried Chicken in Toronto\" so I gave it a try. The chicken itself is okay but there are way better options around town.   I was in the mood for spicy fried chicken, so I got the Lightning Hot Chicken. While the composition, quality and taste of the chicken was decent, it was just drenched in habanero hot sauce, so it was nearly inedible. It didn't have any balance between hot and sweet, even when I put maple syrup on it. The habanero overpowered every flavour.   With a pint, fries (which are really good) and tip, the bill came to roughly 40$. IMO, that was way overpriced for the quality of the meal. Perhaps I will try again one day, but I will definitely not go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"This was not a planned trip to check out Union Chicken but after walking around Sherway, we decided to give Union Chicken a shot because well -- we love fried chicken.   The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, the little things such as the imprint of the logo on the plates and wall decor gave an authentic impression. We were greeted by a kind server who handed us our menu which to our surprise was limited. Left us confused as we turned to the backside to see that a  decent portion of the menu was for brunch only. Not an issue since we were looking to get fried chicken alone, however if you are a picky eater-- u may be just ordering from the sides category.  We had ordered the O.G style sandwich and the triple cooked fries. The sandwich (i would say was more of a burger feel - the buns looked shiny and yummy) had a perfect balance of buttermilk fried chicken, with the creamy slaw and sauces that really tied each bite. My friend even stated how the chicken felt really \"clean\", which was expected as the wall decor mentions how the chickens are free-ranged chickens!  The fries were good- however the fact that it was in a steel mug had left the fries on the bottom/middle to be soggier. If you like your fries crispy all the way through, a tip would be to pour the fries out on the plate provided. The sauce that comes with the fries was nothing out of the ordinary.  TLl;DR - O.G burger was very good, a bit on the pricy side (i.e. sandwich and fries with tax roughly 20$) considering sides are extra but very filling."}
{"text":"It's okay. Nothing great, nothing bad. I got the UC Viet \"Banh\" and it wasn't exactly what I expected. I thought the pulled chicken would be warm because I think that's the only way I've ever eaten pulled chicken, but it was cold. They also put way too much cilantro on it. Not a huge deal as I just took it off, but I took a pile of cilantro the size of my fist off the sandwich! And there was still enough on the sandwich. The fries were good. I really liked their piri piri sauce.   It's also pretty expensive for what you get. I understand the chicken is organic and local, but not worth it to me. I don't think I'd go again."}
{"text":"A friend who grew up in this area suggested we go here for brunch and I thanked her for the delicious suggestion after!   Spicy Chili Beans & Eggs which I had was great!   The only thing that I would have changed about it is to add a 2nd piece of the Texas toast to go with (and help mop up) the second soft boiled egg. Would totally come here again to try more of the menu but do not get out to Etobicoke super often. That said, next time I'm in the area for brunch, I know where I'm going! The only problem will be deciding if I want the same thing again (because it was so good & darn near a perfect meal) or trying out something different which may not be quite on the same level as the spicy chili beans & eggs...but then again, that's part of the adventure, isn't it? Imma stop rambling now, go try this place"}
{"text":"Food was sub-par and the service was horrible.   I went this past Sunday afternoon, where there was only 4 other people in the restaurant. I was seated close to the kitchen on a long bench.  The server was a fellow around his late 20's. He came over and seemed he had a bit of an attitude, but ignored it. I asked a few questions about the menu items seeing it was my first time there. It seemed like it was too much of an effort for him to respond. I asked for a glass of ice water and ordered the UC Viet \"Banh\" pulled chicken sandwich and the spit fired sweet potato. Trust me, is sounds much better than it looked and tasted. The sandwich was $14 and the single sweet potato was $6.  The food was brought over by another server and when it arrived I was a bit stunned. The sandwich was super small and the sweet potato was a single potato sliced in half which was seasoned, baked with a dollop of sauce on each half.   The sandwich was completely flavourless and the potato was nothing to sing about. This sandwich is there take on the Vietnamese Sandwich. I've had Vietnamese sandwiches that were 3x the size, that tasted much better at half the price. Also, the bun was was too small and everything inside the sandwich kept falling out.  Now the server - He was horrible! When he initially came to my table he said, \"how you doing man?\", then he called me \"bro\" and also said \"yo\". Really? Is this how to speak to customers? During my time there he had brought over their two BBQ sauces and the bill. But how he brought it over is another thing. He brought these items behind me by leaning over the bench on my left side. I had to lean over to the right so he can put these items on the table. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I have never seen that before. This guy was too lazy to walk 6 feet to my table and face me. Additionally, neither he or anyone else asked me how the food was.  I was also able to listen to the servers mindless conversation behind me who were by the open concept kitchen. I really don't need to hear this garbage while I'm having my meal on a Sunday afternoon.  Suffice to say, I found Union Chicken pricey for what you get, food not tasting that great and bad service. Would I go back again? ABSOLUTELY NOT!"}
{"text":"Chicken is raw. Unacceptable.  I had high expectations because of the reviews here. However, the take out food quality is very bad, I had to throw half of the take out away due to undercooked food.  PLEASE DO NOT serve raw chicken ever again."}
{"text":"YUMMM!  I love everything about this place!   Atmosphere   Service  Food  Cleanliness   I really wanted to try everything on the menu but there were only two of us so it was a hard decision!! We ordered half rotisserie chicken, buttermilk fried chicken, triple fried fries (with a tasty spicy mayo/chipotle dip), biscuits (with a \"to-die-for\" butter) and coleslaw  The rotisserie chicken was super juicy and served with gravy on the side.   The buttermilk fried chicken was soooo crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. With gravy and hot sauce drizzled on top  Their biscuits were warm, flaky and so damn good with their butter!  Fries were crispy and surprisingly not very oily! Also went well with their dip!  Their coleslaw was perfectly dressed!  I'm drooling again just writing about this! OH and if you enjoy hot sauces, you gotta try their piri piri hot sauce! It's for a nice kick to it! (You can also buy them)   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After an unexpected and painful 2 hour commute home last night we decided to order takeout from Union Chicken. We placed our order over the phone for a whole chicken, charred broccoli salad and fries. I didn't have high expectations for this restaurant since I don't love rotisserie chicken but it was actually delicious. The chicken was super moist with perfectly crispy skin. They cut it into 4 portions for us accompanied by 2 different sauces. Total cost with tax was just under $50.00. Price was quite high for what we ordered but it tasted great and was worth the money. We ate everything and the portion was perfect for 2 people."}
{"text":"I had the spicy chicken sandwich when I came with my friends and it was the best chicken burger I've ever tried. The chicken was thick, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Flavours were a perfect combination of savoury sauce and seasoning on the chicken with some sweetness from the buttermilk buns. Be warned though that this is the spiciest chicken sandwich I've ever had (a plus for me), but if you're not good with spicy food stay away from this menu.   The only downside is the price. $14 for the sandwich and $6 for fries on the side is pretty ridiculous. The portions for the sides are also tiny. Despite it being delicious, I would only return if I really feel like spoiling myself for a chicken burger."}
{"text":"Decided to meet a few friends in Etobicoke and one of them recommended this place. Since they do not take reservations, use Yelp to put your party on their wait list so you do not have to wait in line upon arrival.  You will receive a text when your table is ready.  From the start, I was thoroughly impressed.  It has very modern decor and is a great spot for any occasion (family, friends, date night).  Our server was extremely professional and nice.  The menu is small so you don't have to spend ages sifting through it. For our mains, we ordered the rotisserie and fried chicken. For our sides, we ordered the fries and the organic spinach and quinoa salad. Not sure if my expectations were low since I assumed this place was just a higher class Swiss Chalet, but I was blown away.  The chicken was extremely tender and juicy and the maple syrup and peri peri sauce made it even better. The fries were good and the spinach quinoa salad was fantastic. On top of that, we were offered 4 shots of whiskey on the house. Overall, l had a great restaurant experience. I will definitely be coming back when I make my way back to the Sherway Gardens area."}
{"text":"I got the OG style and Spicy Fried Chicken. Overall disappointing experience. Chicken was severely under-seasoned and over priced.   At first glance, the chicken does look appetizing. Skin is really crispy and not greasy. Meat is cooked well and juicy. However, the taste is well below par.   The skin tasted like it was almost burnt, with zero flavour. Typically, the skin is the best part of fried chicken but it was pretty much like eating fried battered with no salt or spices. A pinch of sea salt on the chicken after it comes out of fryer can go a long way. Maybe even brine the chicken to get some flavour deep into the meat.   Peri Peri Sauce was good. Sauces were ok but nothing spectacular. Service was good. However, I was surprised the default Tip option is set up at 18% but guess that comes with the territory.  As I work close by, I may return to try the rotisserie chicken but unlikely to buy the fried chicken again."}
{"text":"Union Chicken is the highly advertised/anticipated restaurant located on the outer perimeter of Sherway Gardens Mall on the side closest to the bus terminal/ToysRus and the main entrance to Nordstrom. It's deceiving from the outside as it gives the impression of a much bigger space but in reality, its a little bigger than good-sized Starbucks - strange given the most of the \"anchor\" restaurants attached to this mall are much larger.  I waited to dine here twice before writing a review for Union Chicken, so I can safely conclude that the experience I received across both visits were accurate now and indicative of what one can expect here.  On my first visit, I went the with OG Fried Chicken and shared a wide assortment of sides with my fiancee. She opted to have less chicken and more of their salads and sides to compliment her vegetarian leanings - despite being a chicken forward joint there IS enough on the menu to feed those in a group, not of the meat-eating sort. The sides were all OK, a little heavy on the cooking, oil and sauces at times (looking at the Brussels sprouts side), as for the chicken, you get 2-3 small fried chicken thighs, no wings, no breasts and no drumsticks or legs. I felt like this was kind of a cheap out for the price.  The aftermath of the meal was really bad, I was up most of the night following my dining experience with painful stomach issues and burps that tasted like bad chicken. I found this off since everything taste good but the reaction was so intense I was confused.  About 2 weeks later I returned with a pal and instead of the OG fried chicken I went with the Lightning Chicken (done in a habanero sauce). Again I had a beer or two, a few fewer sides (but sharing non-the-less) and the chicken. The flavour of that lightning chicken was amazing, crazy heat, big bold flavours and a good crunch on the chicken. Again I was disappointed with the small thigh portions - come on guys, event KFC offers you a leg and a breast, I don't believe 2-3 thighs is sufficient as a true test of your chicken skills lies in how your cooking and batter measure up to each of the regular parts that most places serve.  However, I forgot about the positives by the time a got home as came down with the same stomach issues again the second time around. I've eaten other fried chicken within the last month and this has never happened to me, so I'm assuming that it is something in how they cook it or prepare it that is causing me all this anguish.  I really cannot blast these guys too much, the flavours are all there but some of the cooking methods must be lacking due to the heavy presence of oils, sauces and subsequent explosions of the rear and equally matched heartburn).  The one other thing I was a little bummed out on is how limited their menu is: rotisserie chicken, fried chicken, chicken sandwiches and sides... this doesn't cut it for me as a sit down restaurant I think they would have been better served and more successful as a fast-casual joint much like Dirty Bird in Kensington Market. hopefully their new/soon-to-be-opened Union Station location is more the latter than a sit down joint, otherwise, I don't see these guys lasting too much longer.  Definitely worth a try, but come packing antacids!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"My favourite place. Come here all the time. It's amazing they can cook chicken in so many different ways. And the crispy brussel sprouts is very impressive. All of my friends and I love it and it's our must-have whenever we eat there. Salute to the owner for the bright ideas."}
{"text":"The place seemed pretty busy so we decided to try it out, service and atmosphere were great, food visually looked great and flavours were pretty good, but the chicken seemed a bit dry for my liking. We tried both the fried and the roasted chicken, both a bit dry. Not really sure if that's just the way they cook it or it was cooked early and sat a bit too long."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have checked out this place twice so far and it was amazing both times! The rotisserie chicken is tender and very flavourful. The fried chicken is also outstanding, crunchy and moist at the same time. The combination of hot sauce, syrup and gravy on top really put the dish over the top for us. As for the sides, the slaw was average but the fries were awesome! The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu and the restaurant has a very cool ambiance! Can't wait to try Uncle Ray's lightning chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here on a Thursday night.  It's a small place with tables a wee bit too close to each other.  I know they're too close when my chair gets bumped several times or our server's behind grazes my shoulders.  A bit more intimate than I really prefer.  Service was friendly and we ordered the quarter chicken and the buttermilk fried chicken with fries, white cheddar biscuits, and Brussel sprouts.  My chicken leg, to be honest, was a bit on the dry side while my SO's fried chicken was mighty fine.  The biscuits were light, fluffy, and tasty and my roasted Brussel sprouts were also yummy.  That peri peri sauce was A-mazing!  I would come back again just to dine on the sides!"}
{"text":"Union Chicken is newly opened at Sherway Gardens.  It's near the south western entrance on The Hudson's Bay side facing Evans Avenue near Shopper's Drug Mart.  The restaurant only has an external entrance with no access to the mall.  I was told there'd be about a 20 - 30 minute wait if we wanted a table instead of counter or bar seating.  The host took my name and number for their text based notification system.  It was going to be a while so we decided to walk the mall for a bit.  After about maybe 15 minutes I was notified that our table was ready.  It was a two seater high top style table but the chairs had backs so we were able to hang our jackets behind our high chairs.  The place has a variety of seating, low tables, high tables, bar seating, counter seating facing the window etc.    The menu seemed really simple.  The choices of mains seem to be different cuts of rotisserie chicken, buttermilk fried chicken to two types of chicken sandwiches.  The variety of sides to select from are all a la carte.  The menu makes it pretty clear that they are offering fresh free range chickens here.  Because of this more natural choice of birds, one shouldn't expect what you get at say, Swiss Chalet.  The chicken here is not going to mutant sized, hormone fed birds so don't expect what you would normally see for a \"regular\" quarter, half, full chicken and order accordingly.  Also know that these birds are more expensive than your standard mass farmed produced chickens.    I had a few people mention Union to me and because of the photos, links, etc I had saw something that looked like \"Nashville Hot\" but I didn't see it on the menu.  Being unsure I had to ask our server Tamara.  Tamara ended up helping me find what I was looking for online and said that the photo we were discussing was actually a secret menu item.  It was called \"Uncle Ray's Lightning Chicken\".  I said yes that is what I was looking for not knowing that this item is a secret but it made sense considering it wasn't on the menu.  My wife went with a quarter white rotisserie and I also went ahead and ordered some sides to with our meals.  I selected the biscuits as well as the three times fried fries and my wife wanted the smashed and fried potatoes.  For drinks my wife had asked for a cold brew coffee (bottled) and I had asked for a tall boy of GLB Canuck.  My wife said her chicken tasted good.  I didn't get a chance to try the biscuits because when my main came I was rather preoccupied.  Tamara described the Uncle Ray's as two thighs, deboned, battered, fried and hot.  It was stacked on a slice of bread with a few sweet pickle slices.  I was told the dish was hot (spicy hot) as it was cooked with a habanero pepper sauce.  I wanted that, I had really wanted something spicy hot for a while.  I had just had Nando's for lunch the same day and it just didn't meet that spicy hot need I had it seemed.    Uncle Ray's Lightning was EXACTLY what I was craving.  The dark meat was tasty, not dry and the pieces were crispy, evenly coated and cooked just right.  This was an amazing stack of spicy hot fried chicken that was tasty and even though it was \"habenero hot\", it wasn't overpowering.  It was enough of a good kick of heat without completely taking over.  If you're wary of jalapeno type heat, don't order this dish as it is hotter than that.  For those seeking a nice kick of heat on great tasting chicken however this dish is for you.  I really liked the fries and even though some pieces looked overcooked they weren't.  The smashed/fried potatoes were about the size of tater tots, covered in some sort of shaved cheese.  Each side was generous enough to share between at least two people.  The dessert which was called \"crack pie\" was a take on a non gooey butter tart it seemed.  Momofuku Milk Bar has their own crack pie but this was served with whipped sour cream and smashed frozen raspberries.  The crust was flaky and the dessert that we shared was really different.   Uncle Ray's ended up being 18 bucks, my wife's quarter white was 10, our 3 sides ended up being 20 bucks, drinks were 13 and the dessert was 8.  The entire meal which was quite filling for the two of us before tax and tip was 67 dollars.  Sherway has upped their game as of late so it's understandable that places like the Keg, Joey and Union Chicken would want to be a part of the mall's renaissance.    I was completely satisfied with the service from Tamara, the friendly greetings by the other staff who seemed all polite, friendly and professional.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Union Chicken for the first time on Sunday afternoon. I had heard amazing things from our friends but hadn't had a chance to get there. It was amazing! The food was delicious!  I ordered the lightning chicken which is notorious for its heat! The great thing about it was that it was spicy and full of flavour! My kids shared the quarter chicken white and it was tender and juicy; cooked to perfection.  I'd like to thank our server, Brittany, for the impeccable service and manager, Tamara, for ensuring our satisfaction. Well done!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food was excellent.  Based on the reviews I probably would not have come here because I generally don't go to three star or less restaurants if I have a choice. I however love rotisserie chicken and if it can be heightened, I gotta give it a try.  The reviews were pretty much bang on, the service was excellent, the food was very good but it was a bit too expensive.  The menu is small (which is good) the dishes were excellent. I had a 1/4 chicken with two sides. They have definitely heightened rotisserie chicken which leads to the burning question, does rotisserie chicken need to be heightened. The easy answer is \"hell ya!!\" Everything needs to be heightened. If you can get comfort foods made above and beyond why wouldn't you?  This unfortunately leads to the one major issue about Union Chicken. It was too expensive.  Keeping in mind I had a beer, my chicken with two sides came up to $44 with tax and tip. I pretty much blew my lunch budget out of the water. $44 for lunch is too expensive. $44 for dinner is too expensive depending on circumstances.  Although I love good food I probably wouldn't come here again (definitely can't come with family).   I gave it four starts because it was everything it was claiming to be it just happened to be too expensive for me :(."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday night. We ordered the OG chicken sandwich and the piri piri chicken. The chicken in the sandwich was nice and crispy but it tasted as if it was fried earlier and sitting under a heat lamp. The food arrived quite quickly which means that had the chicken been fried to order, it should have been hot. Instead, the chicken was warm at best and tasted oily as it felt like the oil had time to soak into the batter. I can understand prepping the chicken if this were a fast food place or even if it had been busy but the place was fairly empty. The piri piri was ok but the size was a little small for the price and given that it didn't come with any sides. Overall, the food was okay but there are definitely better places in the city for chicken."}
{"text":"Proud of this restaurant as this is not another US franchise, and meaningful as it was opened by two friends locally.   So we started off with the sidekick. We ordered the triple cooked fries and made it into a poutine. The gravy tasted very good with a peppery flavour.  Main:  O.G. style buttermilk breaded boneless thighs  Hot sauce, maple honey syrup, gravy ($16)  I find the batter too thick and the maple honey syrup over powering and too sweet. My boyfriend suggested a good idea that next time to put the maple honey syrup aside.   I totally enjoyed the salt fired chicken (rotisserie chicken) very tender and juicy. Tasted better than Swiss Chalet, Nando or St Hubert. The UC dipping sauce went well. The Peri Peri sauce was very tasty that we had to buy one to take home. $8 a bottle. Will go when when eating chicken nuggets or fish sticks at home.   The rose lemonade went well with the Chicken.  Very good ambiance and music. Service was good. One thing I do recommend in terms of the decor is that in the washroom maybe not put the art work of chicken as it's not too appealing to see them before I eat them in my meal. Will return for sure and can't wait until the union station location open in November!"}
{"text":"Just as tasty and juicy as the one out at Sherway Garden at the west end. The flavour is good and not too dry. One thing that I do suggest and prefer is to modify the dipping sauce consistency so that it can be a little thicker. This is by far still my favourite chicken place in town. Very relaxing and lovely ambiance and friendly service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The only good thing I can mention about Union Chicken is the quality of customer service from their wait staff. They were very courteous and informative about the menu and specials. As far as food is concerned they have very limited options to begin with. The good part is they use organic chicken but then what's the point when the bird wasn't flavourfull.  We ordered Korean BBQ chicken, buttermilk fried chicken, rotisserie sweet potato and fries.  Out of all that it was the buttermilk fried chicken that stood out and for the Korean BBQ chicken I had to use their Piri Piri sauce as the chicken lacked flavour. For the price that I paid it was definitely not worth it. With that amount I can get a week's supply of fried chicken and fries from Popeyes and tastier ones too.  I hate to say this but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone or maybe it's just me who is not comfortable paying $100 for chicken and potatoes."}
{"text":"Menu is small, which just means specialized. Amazing, friendly and knowledgeable staff. I have been here twice now, once with a friend and once at lunch for a business meeting. Love their decor!"}
{"text":"While shopping in Sherway Gardens, I felt like trying some fried chicken and came across Union. The place is right next to entrance 7 and only a few months old. They serve rotisserie and fried chicken with a variety of sides at an extra cost.  Weekly drink specials will make this a good try place and while the rotisserie is more St. hubert than Swiss Chalet, it's not bad when you add the piri piri sauce. Our accompaniment of fried brussel sprouts topped off a pretty good meal. My habanero plated fried chicken had a good zing in heat but I would probably try another option next time.  The house wine is a blend of pinot and riesling which definitely need to be changed to compliment the spice in the chicken!"}
{"text":"Read the Toronto star write up so thought I'd give it a try.  My kids have nut allergies, it's not a nut free restaurant but they did inform the cook.   We ordered the full chicken, sides were fries, sweet potato  (one cut in half with sour cream), biscuit and coleslaw.  For a family of 4 we were full.  Chicken was juicy. I liked everything! Will come back to try the fried chicken next time. Would like if they had a family meal for eat in (take out is full chicken and 4 sides for 48...good deal if you live close by). Or a sampler so we can try a bit of both...fried or roasted....  Staff was attentive and nice...warm family environment but very crowded."}
{"text":"We ordered the OG Style Uncle Ray Fried Chicken plate.  The maple honey syrup sauce it comes with is quite good but for $16 it's not worth it.  All you get is the boneless fried chicken... Probably only 2 price worth and veggies are extra... I had hoped they give you at least some coleslaw.  The fried chicken itself isn't any better than Popeye's chicken and for $16 I can get a lot more at Popeye's.  We also ordered the Crispy Brussels Sprouts.  It was mediocre though.  Wouldn't come here if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service, perfect for a lunch with friends and colleagues but too loud and casual (and probably messy) for a work lunch. Good food overall. Better than average chicken. The sides (potato salad and biscuits) were just OK. A tiny bit pricey but that's on par for the convenient location."}
{"text":"Price [1/5]  I paid $15 for a take-out burnt bun but cold chicken burger.  Purchased in the take-out section because I had to 15-mins until my gotrain arrived.  It's priced similar to the other sit-in restaurants at Union Station on York St.  I do hope Union Station's food court opens by 2019.  The place is missing a Japanese take-out bento place.  Thank God for McDonalds, Starbucks, and Uncle Tetsu.  If those places weren't there, I'd be starving at this Gotrain central station.  Also, the staff would be unhappy with the lack of choices.  Food [1/5]  Instagram Pic of my burnt sandwich:  - http://bit.ly/2J8tQ4V   How exactly can a \"cook\" burn the bun while heating it on a grill?  Simple, no oil at all.  He ended up not putting any oil on either the grill or bun.  Definitely was a new staff and was not trained properly as he did not gather the other ingredients in advance.  I guess he's never watched the Food Network's channel watching the chefs gather items all in advance before chopping/dicing/cooking.  One reason is to avoid cross-contamination between the cooked and raw food but ah well.    I ended up getting food poisoned (the morning after) because I took a few bites and tasted the burnt (but ice cold bread o-0).  It was terrible and would never go back to this place.  Take-out Service and Atmosphere [2/5]  I was attracted to the social media and how it's organic local raised chicken.  The dining area definitely has that trendy/underground aura to relax around.  Payment was made through credit card transaction where the girl at the register did not ask or provide a receipt.  Usually, I do not care but given how terrible the \"chicken sandwich\" was I regret not getting it as \"proof of payment\".    Waited over 10-mins (which was getting really close to my Gotrain departure) for the dude to burn my ice-cold bun burger.  I was starving and waited patiently but mentally took notes of his poor food handler training.  Evidently, he was not certified or just didn't give an @$$ about it.  I took only a few bites to discover how terrible the burnt bun was and the char-cancer-like flavour of \"bbq\" as he stated.  Yea, okay.  The girl at the register said he'll make you a new one but given the time-sensitivity of my Gotrain, I didn't have the time or want to risk getting \"extra ingredients\" in my burger for complaining.    I dropped the burger off on the counter and ran for my Gotrain.  Proper training for this place needs to be set in place or at least management to ensure the quality of the food is safe.  I did not see a manager on hand as I requested to speak to one, the girl said he wasn't present.  Just gave up and regretted dropping $15 on a terrible \"burger\".    Overall [0/5]  I will never be eating at this place or getting take out.  Given the feedback here is on par, my experience was not a stand-alone situation.    If you're ever at Union Station on York, just go to McDonald's or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Double rye and gingers are $9. Staff are nice and quick. Good place to get a drink before heading off.  Review is based on the drinks and staff - I did not have any of their food."}
{"text":"After a years of no real food options at union, this place is great. Decent little wine and beer list and easy food options. Great vibe and really impressive service. Everyone was friendly and no one seamed like it was a chore to be working."}
{"text":"Located inside the renovated part of Union station, it is really in a perfect spot for all the commuters. However, I wasn't impressed with their signature fried chicken. The batter wad too thick for my liking, it was also really oily. I've had better fried chicken at Popeyes... Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had my first UC experience at the Sherway Gardens location when it first opened - coworker and I had shuck out of work to travel across town for fried chicken and we were not disappointed.  Recently went to UC at Union Station for Sunday dinner with the parents and older brother (after months of walking by the reno site). Was not disappointed, the OG fried chicken was just as good as I remembered. Crispy with juicy meat with some sweet sauce on the side to complement.   We also ordered a whole roast chicken, this did not disappoint either. Super juicy, really flavourful. And still warm - our server timed the delivery of our food to table perfectly. We all agreed it's better than the rotisserie chicken from Flock (on Harbord) - albeit it is more expensive here.   Parents also really enjoyed the roasted brussel sprouts - even my dad, who was skeptical of this new-to-him vegetable. They were a bit blackened, crispy, and with just enough sweetness.   Overall, service is good, food is great, but a tad too pricey."}
{"text":"Union Chicken is a much-needed We had a work reunion lunch on a Friday. I tried their open-faced truck stop sandwich with pulled chicken, peas and gravy on a thick slice of toasted bread. Comfort food at its finest! The cost was a bit much for lunch so I would not go there on a regular basis but it's a nice treat once in awhile."}
{"text":"Wait at hosting station a bit long but tolerable...serves my meal to someone else. ..apologies for them because the gentleman didn't get his meal i get a aside of yours will come out...they get rechecked on to assure them his is coming. When they arrive (mine and his) they slap mine down and run. No apologies despite my wait being significant my sandwich is obviously skimping on chicken to make it quicker and no effort made to make up to me for the inconvenience yet the couple received 4 apologies.  Gee guess all the money i normally spend at grand electric up north can stay in my pocket now"}
{"text":"Very upbeat ambiance at Sherway Gardens. Everything was extremely high quality at Union Chicken. I was impressed with every dish they had here. I was happy with all the dishes that we ordered.   SIDES: Most to Least fave 1. Crispy Brussel Sprouts ($9) - chilli gastrique, UC ranch, spiced seeds Roasted, crispy goodness. They make  vegetable sides taste SO good.  2. Charred Broccoli Salad ($9) - red onion, pecorino, garlic parsley dressed  Equally good as the brussel sprouts; I just don't eat brussel sprouts as much as broccoli so it was next to best  3. Triple Cooked Fries ($6) - russet potatoes, sea salt, Piri Piri mayo The potatoes were nicely dense, solid skinned exterior and perfectly cooked. That pecorino ontop made it amazing  4. Rotisserie Sweet Potato ($7) - chilli lime butter, sour cream, chives Sweet potatoes were soft and was loaded with a delicious sour cream  CHICKEN ENTREES: Most to Least fave 1. Fried Chicken & Waffles ($16) - whipped sour cream, maple-honey syrup On their brunch menu from 10am-2pm and I tried the fried chicken & waffles and it definitely went beyond my expectations. The flavours of the syrup and sour cream went perfectly with it  2. Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($16) - hot sauce, maple-honey syrup, gravy Love love love the chicken here. It's super delicious, fresh, and juicy. It's doused in hot sauce and gravy and has a very home-cooked warming flavour.  3. Rotisserie (Quarter for $~8) - The sauce and grilled lemon served with it is delicious. Also good with piri piri sauce. A little on the small side in portion.  4. Fried Chicken Sandwich ($13) - milk bun, coleslaw, peppers, UC ranch, pickle It's a good start to get a preview of the taste of their fried chicken but I recommend 1 & 2 over it"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Union Chicken, the concept seems pretty simple, but way more exciting than say, Swiss Chalet or Nando's.    We only ordered fried chicken (no rotisserie) and it was really very tasty.  The best part was the hot sauce on top - not too hot and a good pepper flavor.  We also tried four of the sides:  - brussel sprouts: the concept is good.  Caramelized brussel sprouts are indeed tasty, but the dish goes overboard in it's accessorizing.  It takes away from the vegetable.  - fries: just OK.  I really think that restaurants that serve things that go with fries, need to step up their fry game.  These were pretty salty and underwhelming.   - sweet potato: quite tasty but a little too much cinnamon/nutmeg.  Just like the brussel sprouts, they went too far and are essentially covering up perfectly good and simple food with too much flare.  - charred broccoli: I didn't personally enjoy this, but it's not Union Chicken's fault.  I figured out that charred broccoli tastes the way chronic bad breath smells.  Would not eat again.  :)  Service was good, the place was cute.  While we enjoyed the dinner, both my husband and I agreed that we wouldn't be aching to come back.  It was just...OK.  Underwhelming.  I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't actively pursue going there.  (Interestingly, this was my conclusion with the Carbon Bar as well - I can definitely see the similarities)."}
{"text":"Had a really awesome dinner here! The OG chicken sandwich was great, as were the biscuits and the coleslaw. Things went so well that I took a chance on an unusual dessert - the sweet potato pie - and it was equally excellent.  I like the general atmosphere here. Very laid-back, great music, friendly staff and all the rest.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food a little pricey  Walking into this restaurant I had no idea what to expect I thought it was a regular restaurants however they only serve chicken. Rotisserie chicken and fried chicken  This place can get pretty pricey because everything is sold individually all the prices of the chicken is just chicken alone all the sides are priced individually so it can definitely add up  I decided to go with the rotisserie chicken half and split it between me and my mother I also got the sweet potato which was an  extremely small  portio but it tastes so good and a salad I forgot what the salad was called but it had avocado onions cucumbers and spices nuts it was really good as well and the chicken was very flavorful their house sauce is a little spicy but it's good. I did not like the gravy I opted out and just used the sauce instead of the gravy   Overall I would go back not as a regular spot but I would go back the food was really good and I left feeling like I ate just the right amount of food I wasn't stuffed and i wasn't still hungry the server was nice the service was a little bit slow because the place was empty and it took them awhile to bring us the bill but the food itself came quickly after we placed the order"}
{"text":"Good but nothing to write home about.   Came here with a group of 5. We decided to do a family style dinner and just order different kinds of chicken and sides and share it all. We got a whole rotisserie chicken and three orders of the fried chicken. The truck stop chicken did not look appetizing. For sides we basically got them all.   The chicken was good but nothing crazy. The sides were all pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the biscuits. The fries were the real highlight. And that chipotle mayo they give you with the fries was the best. I used it for my chicken as well.   The sauce they give you for the chicken is actually pretty good. It's got the perfect amount of spice to it. It's really funny though, so be careful when pouring. Mixed drinks were good too. Bill was $200 + tip and fed us all really well (food and alcohol).   Next time I get a craving for chicken I probably won't think of coming here. But it seems like a solid date spot."}
{"text":"Imagine your self getting the very last small extra crispy  nearly burnt rock hard fries, now imagine the super super small  6$ add on  being entirely made up of rock fries. that's what's going down here.i can handle a good tasting bad valu but not a a bad tasting well presented super bad valu. Yikes Belgian fries fried done at two temps ,   Here it's 3.   1 crisp it,  temp two crisp it more  Temp 3 lets make sure it's crispy   Weird weird trying to  to to hard menu Staff was ambivalent , told the girl the fries were terrible , she said too crispy? So she has heard it before, offer to take it off menu?Nope Take out menus not easy transportable to eat"}
{"text":"Ok to start off this looked like a different option before my train. Lets go I've it a go! Well the staff  I didn't have high hopes for friendly genuine service and was not surprised, ambivalent and wafting around, seemed to be the over all vibe.  I selected an order of open faced chicken sandwich , portion was sized fine enough , was ok, but the issue was the fries. I mean the  value priced 6$ miniscuale sampler fry order  You know the last few fries that are well over fried on your plate? We I got an entire serving of them! That's right, not crispy but tender. Not Crispy, but hard un flavoured. I mentioned this to the waitress who seemed to NGAF, and at least offered for them to redo them, was told they were triple fried. Now I am not french fry expert, but the Belgians fry theirs at two temps, here however seems to be : 1. Lets crisp these  real good temp 2. Lets Blacken these temp 3. I forgot did we do the first two already temp?  In the end having discussed it and having not eaten them, did she offer to take them off the bill? Nope .... got to get back to her phone and selfies  I would say the place was not to busy, portions not the biggest, taste not the greatest, price on the high side, so at least get people in , who are good at service, people can forget the other stuff but they never forget when they have a good time and are well taken care of. That usually starts with people. Loosen up the skinny jeans, their cutting of circulation to your servers brains....."}
{"text":"I tried the OG chicken and the KFC, both were disappointing.  The OG was very crunchy, which is good, but it was very bland... it's was just chicken and batter... no spices/seasoning, it even needed salt.  The KFC was weird. The sauce had a lot of seasoning, it was just too strong. The worst part was that the \"fried chicken\" got mushy from the sauce. So basically you get over-seasoned soggy chicken skin.  The only good thing was that the actual quality of the chicken was nice."}
{"text":"I don't eat fried chicken and I am not really a fan of it BUT this place knows how to cook it right. Delicious and great service too! Plus the Piri Piri sauce can be bought to take home."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a a group of 5 friends and we feasted! We tried the rotisserie and fried chicken, Brussel sprouts, fries, coleslaw and sweet potatoes. The rotisserie chicken was tender, but the fried chicken was my fav. Super crunchy and boneless thigh pieces. The brussel sprouts and French fries are definite stand outs. My friend and I tried the lavender mule which was really tasty. I'm not a big fan of gin, but this was a great cocktail. The service is outstanding! We got great recommendations and attentive service.  It's not the cheapest but it's a nice alternative to other chain chicken places like Swiss Chalet or Nandos.  Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Tried the OG fried chicken meal for takeaway. So I'm not sure whether the minimum wage increase has an effect on prices or whether this restaurant thinks two pieces of fried chicken with three sauces is worth $16 plus tax.  The chicken has a pretty nice crunch most likely to die a hefty dredge. The spices had a faint curry flavor. You get a hot sauce, a maple syrup type of sauce and a chunky gravy.  The chicken was pretty good but it's neither the best or the worst I ever had. Especially for the price, I probably won't be going for it again in the future.  The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere though.  I wouldn't bother if you're broke. Popeyes will do."}
{"text":"Ordered a OG and a Viet Banh plus a side of fries (extra) which came to around $50.  The Viet Banh was Wonderbread style hamburger bun smeared with a thick layer of orange mayonnaise  and sprinkled with bagged coleslaw - there was NO CHICKEN on this chicken sandwich - and it was $15.  The OG was basic fried chicken on par quality wise with KFC but at about 5 times the price, but they threw in a couple tiny plastic cups of a weird watery sauce.  The fries were good - a small handful cost an additional $7.  Rude hipster staff that obviously hates customers and chicken."}
{"text":"Healthy delicious chicken! Great service!!! As an American visiting Toronto this place was great. Causal, quick & friendly. The quinoa salad as well as the chicken were delicious."}
{"text":"Awful. Very expensive $22+ for two pieces of chicken and a side. Chicken was poorly cooked with nice thick rubbery skin under the breading. Tasted gross and threw out half of it. Potato salad was decent.  Best to avoid."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Union Chicken on Sunday while taking a stroll through the Sherway Gardens Mall. This may be a little confusing to find if you are walking around the inside as the only entrance is actually on the outside, although there are signs to guide you. Inside of Union Chicken looks super cool and kind of looks like a newer style brewery with food if that makes sense, either way it looks really nice. The staff was super friendly and helpful during our visit and the menu gives you what you want, grilled chicken, fried chicken, chicken sandwiches, and of course even chicken strips. Even though it was difficult to choose I decided to go with the O.G. style chicken which was is basically a couple of glorious pieces of fried chicken. The chicken was absolutely delicious and so filling that I couldn't even finish it all. My only complaint with this place was that side dishes are separate, and I've always been a firm believer that every meal should come with at least a small side (especially when sides range from ($4-$10. Overall, this is a great chicken joint and certainly a food standout at the Sherway Gardens. I highly recommend any fried chicken fan or anyone with taste buds check this place out."}
{"text":"I know why people are hating on this place. The sides were just okay. The coleslaw kinda sucked, the biscuits were a little dry and the Brussels sprouts(although delicious) were pretty greasy.   But the reason to come here is the Nashville Hot Chicken. Crunchy and delicious crust dipped in a sweet and spicy cayenne sauce and topped with extra spicy habanero peppers.  You will sweat, your mouth will burn but you will want to come back."}
{"text":"Never go to this place again. Loud music playing, place is still packed. Place closes at 11 but I watch two other people walk in & get seated. I try to go in and get told they are closed.   I did just get off work so I'm in my work clothes. Guess this place doesn't cater to those who don't work in a office."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my best buddy, and could NOT recommend this place.  The good - tasty fried chicken  The BAD - extremely long wait time (ordered 12:05-12:10 and got our food $12:45)                  - small portions $16 for chicken and $6 for so-so tasting coleslaw   I am uploading pictures so you can be the judge.  While My friend and I wouldn't mind on splurging for a meal, this place is absolutely not worth it as we paid almost $30 PER PERSON (my friend ordered a salad and hot chicken) for this meal (after tax and tips). WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!  Will not be back until portion sizes improve and I can get my food within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Basically a bougier Swiss Chalet. The place was half full on a Saturday around 5:30 p.m. We were seated at a high chair table that didn't have any hooks for your shopping bags or purse. So we were forced to just set our bags on the floor. Our server came immediately and offered us some water. I do love that they leave the whole bottle of water at your table. Saves from having to flag them down every 10 seconds. The glasses are pretty small.  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and a side of sweet potatoes and my friend ordered the truck stop chicken sandwich. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. My friend really enjoyed her sandwich and said the gravy was really good. She did say it was also really peppery. I tried a bite and agreed. The gravy was really good though. I feel like it's a type of gravy I wouldn't get sick of and that's good since your sandwich is basically drenched in it. I did enjoy the fried chicken. Some pieces had too much breading than others and I didn't bother with those ends. The chicken was juicy and the breading had good flavour. I loved the hot sauce on top. I could do without the gravy at the bottom as the hot sauce was good enough. The piri piri sauce made it even better though! I love their piri piri! You get 4 pieces of chicken, but I was able to finish it all. So they're not that big. I'm glad I got this, as I don't think I would be as satisfied if I got the rotisserie chicken. Although I would like to know how it tastes. The roasted sweet potatoes tasted a little weird to me. It was the lime butter. The lime was a little too over powering. I ate it for the sake of eating it but I did not enjoy it. My friend liked it though. So it just depends on your taste buds.  We saw a lot of families come in while we were there. I guess the whole getting a whole chicken makes it easier to feed a family. It's really a no fuss menu. There's literally 4 mains you can get lol and then you add sides. I'd maybe return to try the rotisserie chicken but I'm not rushing to come back."}
{"text":"Went here with a small group - this place is really less than meets the eye  TLDR: This place is not worth it and you are better off going to Popeyes, maybe even KFC. Loud music (kind of difficult to have a coversation) and it is pretty packed. Avoid the Biscuits if you go there, the Poutine is decent but not worth the price, the OG Chicken is not great either.   here is what we ordered:  Poutine: The poutine was just a regular poutine that you would get anywhere else - fries, cheesecurds, (chicken) gravy and they also added chives. Apparently that makes it worth $10 for a small plate. It was balanced in that it was not too salty, but definitely not worth the money  Biscuits: The cheese biscuits were $4 for 2. Considering all you need to make biscuits is flour (and I guess, cheese), it was pretty expensive. We got it fresh out of the oven and they came with some very salty sauce that is not worth bothering with unless you're looking to get a kidney stone tonight. When I bit into my first biscuit I immediately understood why it was $4. They must have used $4 worth of salt to make it, possibly more if they were feeling generous. The biscuits were so unbelievably salty that I could not even finish it. It is a must-avoid  OG Chicken: The OG Chicken was recommended by the waiter friendly waiter we had. It was pretty disappointing considering it was something like 2 small thighs (not including the drumstick) for $14. I don't know if its just me, but I'm not really into half-cooked clumps of flour and chicken skin (think boiled chicken skin) with my fried chicken. It was really gross and not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Some pretty damn good fried chicken. Sides were hearty and big. A bit pricey, but that's expected because meat quality is high. This ain't no Swiss Chalet.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've picked up the friend chicken sandwich now for takeout twice. It is really good! I love a good chicken sandwich and this one hangs with the best of them. Nice and crispy, every bite is a crunch. The fries are also really good. Going to become a regular part of my lunch rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Organic free-range Chickens! That's right! Never frozen and they claim they do not have a freezer only for Ice cream! Everything is Fresh as they say and THEY WERE RIGHT!  This place was located in Sherway Gardens Mall but entrance is outside, no in-mall entrance. The ambiance of this restaurant is dim but cozy. Great for dates, or big dinner gatherings as they have communal tables available for larger groups. This place can probably sit up to ~45 people. They also have a licensed bar.  Came here for a V-Day dinner with my fiancé and since it was new, we were excited to try it out! We were immediately greeted and seated immediately. The waitress that served us was really nice and she gave good recommendations on what to try out.   We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken($16) and a quarter rotisserie chicken- dark meat ($8), also added the $4 white cheddar biscuits with lime and piri piri butter. We also ordered the coleslaw for sides.   Didn't try any desserts- biggest regret!  The Rotisserie Chicken came with a light gravy which was a nice accompaniment. The chicken was juicy and tender, the flavour didnt have anything special...it reminded me of the Whole Roasted Chicken that you can purchase at Loblaws or Metro. Was it worth it nope...but then again, you are paying for fresh free range ORGANIC chicken. Avoid the quarter if you want to share, just go for the half sized chicken.  The Buttermilk Chicken was crispy and had a drizzle of spicy maple syrup gravy, very great dish but yet again for 16 dollars I thought it would be pieces of chicken with bones. This was a small platter of chunky chicken strips. As much as I want to love this dish, I wouldn't say it was worth 16 dollars.  The Coleslaw gave the biggest bang for your buck! Good portion and worth the 5 dollars. Crispy and fresh, everything was very balanced with the sweet mayo, carrots, red onions and black sesame seeds. The tartness cut through the fatty rich taste of the chicken.  The White Cheddar Biscuits were another miss for me. For 4 dollars, I expected 3-4 mini biscuits or 2 large ones. Nope 2 mini biscuits, they were good and plain. The butter that came with the biscuits was lacking..it needed a little more something. Smoky..? Spiceyness ?..sweetness? Or all three perhaps. All I tasted were the Subtle lime flavour and a peppery taste. It felt like a cliffhanger.   They sell and serve their own piri piri sauce as well. It was great! I would buy it. It taste tangy and spicy.   We also ordered some drinks.  Igot the Lavender Mule..I recommend!! And my Fiancé got the Root beer stormy...it's quite strong with a sweet finish.  I see the appeal of this restaurant. A slightly healthier choice due to its organic chicken and such. I'll definitely come for a drink and snack but not a full on dinner or Try out their Breakfast next time"}
{"text":"I understand why people like this place - it's family-friendly, it has a good amount of tables, service is very friendly (they check on you very often - thanks to our server Lakeisha for being super sweet and attentive!), they take reservations, there are TVs, and the interior is nice, clean and modern (almost like an upscale Swiss Chalet). So despite the food being just alright to us, we would still come back here, because with all factors considered, it's a safe venue choice overall.   Located beside the soon-to-be Nordstrom (attached to Sherway Gardens Mall, with the entrance facing The West Mall), we visited on a Thursday evening and ordered: Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($16), Triple Cooked Fries ($6.00), and Quarter White Rotisserie Chicken ($8,00), plus an extra $4.00 to add White Cheddar Biscuits and chili lime butter. Out of everything we ordered, we liked the Buttermilk Fried Chicken best. Although, warning, I do like Popeyes chicken and the crunchy skin that comes with it, so that's probably why I liked it - it's covered in a lot of crunchy batter and it's basically half batter, half chicken. I would NOT order the White Cheddar Biscuits again - extremely dry, it felt like biting into cardboard. As well, while the Rotisserie Chicken was nice a juicy, it wasn't anything amazing in the flavour department - basically, it was just alright.  Everything here felt pretty standard. But, with all factors considered (good service, location, ample seating), there's a good chance we'll be back. With tax and tip, we paid almost $50."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out because of the impressive pedigree of the people behind it, so I'll be honest: my expectations were a little high.  It's a small place but it has a cozy feel, so that's nice. I decided to go with the Truck Stop Chicken Sandwich (\"pulled rotisserie chicken, green peas, gravy\"). This is a weird item. It's basically presented as an open-face sandwich that's swimming in gravy. And it's fine. The pieces of chicken seemed good, the bread seemed fresh, and the peas didn't seem frozen. I say \"seemed\" because the thing is so doused in gravy that really it's the only thing you taste. The gravy is rich, although maybe a little too sweet for my liking.  We also decided to share an order of the Crispy Brussels Sprouts (\"chili gastrique, UC ranch, spiced seeds\"). The brussels sprouts themselves were indeed crispy and quite tasty, though their impact was often lost underneath the very aggressive accompaniments (which, again, were way too sweet for the dish).  I should also note that my dining companion got the quarter chicken (which he called too salty) and the white cheddar biscuits (which he referred to as the worst biscuit he'd ever eaten, and I can't really argue with that, as the biscuit was insanely dense and basically impossible to chew).  Union Chicken's been open for, as of this writing, less than a couple of weeks, so it's possible there are kinks that need to be worked out. Let's hope that's all it is."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the service that was provided during my visit. The manager and staff was very hospitable and friendly as they ensured my friend had a good birthday dinner. However, albeit how amazingly kind the staff was it doesn't disregard the fact that we were reviewing food--not service.   The best thing about this place was their chicken burger with their special piri piri sauce. Aside from that, their fried chicken, baked sweet potato and coleslaw was alright. Honestly, there wasn't any taste in the coleslaw at all and the sweet potato and sour cream and lime didn't quite go well together. My friends who ordered rotisserie chicken found it dry but the portions were bigger than anticipated so that's a plus.   Aside from that, Union chicken has a lot of potential to be so much better with just a few fixes!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me. My fiancé and I came here during opening week curious to try Sherway's newest addition. The ambiance was nice, the menus are simple and not cluttered with too many options. We started with a few drinks, a lavender mule for the fiancé and a root beer stormy for myself. They were both great but boy were they strong. We started with the white cheddar biscuits with lime and piri-piri butter which were good but were definitely lacking something. The portion size leaves a lot to be desired as well which I found was a recurring theme here. 2 small biscuits for $4, definitely underwhelming, would be better if it were 3-4 per order.  For the entrees we ordered the buttermilk fried chicken ($16) and the quarter rotisserie chicken (dark meat - $8). We absolutely loved the fried chicken as the batter was nice and crispy but the chicken stood out as it was juicy and had a nice kick to it. The rotisserie chicken was juicy and flavourful as well but nothing special to write home about.  The accompaniment we had was the coleslaw which was the only dish that we felt justified it's price. A hearty serving that went well with the chicken entrees, very tasty and added a nice crunch with the fresh cabbage.  Overall, my biggest gripe is the price that you pay does not justify the portion size. I do understand that you are paying for quality since the chickens are organic free-range chickens but if the prices are lowered by just a few bucks, I think that would strike the perfect balance."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night, and it was relatively quiet, with only a few other parties in the restaurant. We were seated quickly, in the dimly lit, colourful space. Despite what other reviews have said, the music wasn't too loud, and I was able to hold a comfortable conversation with my friend. It's a cozy little restaurant that quickly transports you to a much more intimate space, despite being in the middle of Union station.   We both ordered the truck stop sandwich, which is a super tasty version of a hot turkey. It's based with a piece of bread, loaded with a mound of chunky shredded chicken, and covered with peas and peppercorn gravy. It comes in a skillet like dish and is intended to be eaten with cutlery. The bread was soft, but didn't melt, the chicken not overly shredded so it still felt like you were eating real chicken, the peas were a nice bite, and the gravy was DELICIOUS (I love gravy, and this was one of the better ones being not too salty with actual peppercorn taste). We made the mistake of ordering fries (which were tasty with a side of piri piri mayo), which were wholly unnecessary because of how large the sandwiches were.   Service was super friendly, and very warm. Our server was kind but unmemorable, but Luke (who either does a little bit of everything, or is the GM of the place) was really nice and incredibly personable.   I will definitely be back for more of their truck stoop sandwiches (and eventually to try the friend chicken)!!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends on Wednesday night, upon walking in I saw 4 other customers and about 6 staff. The ambience is modern rustic.   Our wait staff was friendly, explained the specials and got our orders.  We waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive, the portions for chicken, fries and salad were normal - but the white cheddar biscuit was a let down, both in size and taste. The OG chicken was both juicy and tasty, but the KFC was dry to very dry (quite disappointed!)."}
{"text":"This place is located next to what will be Nordstrom's in Sherway Garden.  It is a great rustic build out.  The space is clean and inviting.  The food is delicious and the portions are relatively large.....especially the fried chicken (one order is enough for 2 people). Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"1.5 I was extremely disappointed by my experience at Union Chicken and cannot wholeheartedly give them a pleasant review despite their food being actually a-ok. I came for a late lunch at 1 and was immediately seated. Server were generally inattentive and took a while to come by with water and take our orders (restaurant was half empty and well staffed). Being unfamiliar with the menu, my friend and I wanted to try 2 proteins first and see how much food it'd be before ordering sides. The waitress questioned our choice and came off quite rude, seeming we couldn't afford sides with our chicken (their protein is already priced above a full meal's value). We ended up getting a quarter dark meat, an OJ fried chicken plate and a fries to share. Food was ok, the rotisserie chicken was juicy and tender. The rub was special and went well with the gravy, but its a dinky drumstick + thigh (think Swiss Chalet on a bad day), so I don't know if its even worth half of that $8.5.  Likewise for the fried chicken, the amount you got for value is horrible. RIP OFF. The crunch was ok, hot sauce numbs your tongue and not pleasant to eat. Chicken was juicy but all in all, nothing special about it. It wasn't horrible food, but nothing to write home about except the outrageous prices."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and both times had a great experience. The atmosphere is cool and makes you feel like your on queen instead of being by a mall. I will definitely be back. I love the way they serve coke and even the water. Good points for quality."}
{"text":"First time at Union Chicken.  I was starving as I just returned from a week in Cuba and looking forward to a decent meal.  Server was great, atmosphere was friendly. The tables were too close for comfort as you could not have a private conversation and you actually hit each other's elbows.  I had ordered a dish from the brunch menu consisting of sweet potato hash topped with avocado and two soft boiled eggs. $12.99.  To my surprise, no avocado, the hash was croutons with two French fried potatoes and the soft boiled eggs were cold out of the fridge.  Can't tell you how queasy my stomach felt after that gross meal.  Top it off, I hate croutons.  Cuba food looked pretty good after that.  Over priced for the quality of food!!  Will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"Located in Union Station on the lower level. Lots of seating and comfortable decor. I really enjoy the food...lots of tasty chicken dishes including my favourite the Truckstop, an old fashioned open faced chicken sandwich with gravy and peas. Service is friendly and fast. Two draft beers, wine selection and some interesting house cocktails.It's a bit pricey for chicken but considering its location and the food quality Im satisfied."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want the best chicken and waffles in the morning best way to start off the day"}
{"text":"Union Chicken, it was good, it wasn't anything special though.   I had the spicy chicken plate - whatever its called  - With a poutine.  It was good, the chicken was spicy and crispy, the gravy on the poutine different but nice. They were however a little light on the cheese curds.   There was nothing bad about union chicken, it just wasn't amazing .  Would I recommend? Sure if you REALLY want fried chicken. Will I be back? I'm going to say no, but crazier things have happened.   Union Chicken. It was good, but not anything special...especially for the price."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times so I guess its pretty good.  The rotisserie chicken is excellent and I would go back just for the Brussel sprouts. Tried the buttermilk fried thighs the other day and would not order again..way over cooked stick with the rotisserie white or dark always good. Staff always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I tried the half chicken fried Korean style. A little on the side of dry, made the use of peri peri sauce all that more necessary. My co-workers tried the OG style fried chicken and they said that was much better. Will be coming back here for the OG fried chicken before a final verdict on Union Chicken."}
{"text":"This place can be a bit loud (music) if you're looking for a quiet spot to chat. However, the food and service totally make up for it. Why talk when u can dine on delectable fried chicken, and crispy fries!  Union Station location is such a quaint, cozy setting that u can easily forget you're in a busy transportation hub.   The staff and management are great at customer service and I cannot say enough about them. I'm usually gushing about the food in my reviews, this time the staff steal the show.    Be sure to try the OG Chicken with Maple Gravy...good portion size and flavor all the way thru.   Suggestion: Would love to see Corn Bread on the menu."}
{"text":"TL;DR I waited 18 minutes for a $14 sandwich made with cold chicken slurry, staff gave away my food to the wrong customer, manager gave me a $10 coupon, and then the sandwich sucked and I bit into a giant bone.  Okay, let's rewind that.  How do I put this nicely.    How about, \"This place is run by a crack team of slow-moving clownshoes who don't give a rat's.\"  Yeah, I think we can start with that.  So I saw this place while I was burning 40 minutes waiting for a train.  Walked in, they had a nice ambiance for their seated service, and a convenient looking takeout counter.  Prices seemed high at $14 plus tax for a sandwich, but hey, we live in Toronto and at least it was going to be good, right?  I placed my order for a Viet \"Bahn\" Pulled Chicken Sandwich, paid, and took off to find something to drink since their selection for takeaway was limited.  Came back 10 minutes later to find my order wasn't filled.  No problem, sometimes food takes longer than 10 minutes, even a sandwich. After all, they had to pull the chicken and then do whatever assembly this sandwich required, right?  Nothing happened for several more minutes.  My takeout bag sat empty.  That's fine, I was sure it was coming up.  Eventually I did see someone on the line start to assemble a sandwich, but it wasn't what I was expecting; I kinda figured this would be served on a baguette, since it was styled after a bahn mi, but it was just on a regular roll.  Whatevs.  Somewhere in the world some dude just got his arms ripped off, and it wasn't me.  One sandwich with a long wait time cannot best my feelings of gratitude toward the universe.    But as the slow moving construction continued to move at the pace of a new above ground line in Scarborough, I started to notice more things that engendered misgivings: the pulled chicken wasn't pulled, it was a pulped and creamed mess of pre-slopped chicken salad.  Sauce was applied sloppily.  About a third of the sandwich was cilantro.  At some point a few slices of carrot and cucumber were applied, which I guess is what qualifies this as \"Viet.\"  When my sandwich was wrapped and the line guy chucked it haphazardly onto the counter, I asked if he could throw another wrap of foil on it since I was about to be eating on a train.   He said the counter people would do it.  They didn't, but they DID stuff my sandwich in somebody else's bag and then give it to him, when even I'd heard him order the spicy chicken sandwich that was now being prepared several feet away.  Sorry, Andrew.  That dude left with my food, and I got to watch the agonizingly slow process of his sandwich being made, and then observed the confused looks of the staff when they went to put it in my bag, and then looked up guiltily to see if I was watching.  I was, so they had to make another one.  At this point we were coming up on 15-16 minutes and combined with the ordering time, my train was boarding.  I got to watch a third sandwich being made even slower than the last two, and finally deposited in my bag (single wrap, sauce leaking everywhere, natch).  While I was picking up my food, someone who looked managerial came over and asked the counter staff how times were going!  They replied everything was great!  Call me petty, but since the deception was going on one foot in front of me, I DID mention \"Well, my sandwich DID take 18 minutes.\"  The manager swiftly drew out a card, gave it to me, apologized for the wait, and proudly proclaimed my next sandwich would be on him! :D  Inspecting the card revealed an equally chipper message: \"NEXT ONE IS ON ME AT UC!\" A closer inspection revealed it was a $10 off coupon, for my $14 +tax sandwich.  I'm pretty sure literally nothing involving chicken here costs $10.  Whatever.  Still just a sandwich, right?  At least they made a gesture.  But once I got to my train and unwrapped what was sure to be a Viet/DirtySouf fusion delight, stuff got worse.    The sandwich sucked.  It sucked /bad/. The pulled chicken which I spied as being meat slurry earlier on was indeed just a mush of flavourless slime, cushioned by a few ribbons of veggies and an outrightly uncomfortable amount of cilantro.  It was also a mess, with sauce going everywhere and all over the outside of the wrapper.    Best part!  Biting into the sandwich evoked a hideous teeth-shattering-on-hard-object sound!  Eager to see what kind of prize was buried inside my dinner (Was it a shiny bottle cap? A rogue piece of kitchenware? The excitement and suspense coursed through me!), I pulled the sandwich apart and found it to be the very chunk of chicken bone photographed below.  How in god's name it made it through the meat slurrying process I have no idea.  I assume some schmuck dropped it into the Chicken Slime Bucket and, like the rest of the staff, couldn't have cared less.  Overpriced trash that's dangerous to eat, served slowly by people who don't care.    Welcome to Union Chicken."}
{"text":"So excited that this restaurant opened right at Union Station! I tried the one at Sherway and enjoyed it. They specialize in rotisserie chicken which was juicy, but I actually like their fried chicken a lot more. My favourite was the OG style chicken plate as the maple honey sauce complemented the savoury chicken well. Their brussel sprouts are also amazing and I would recommend that over fries."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The server was very polite and helpful. Ordered OG chicken and it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Quick stop, ordered takeout before catching the train. The service was prompt and efficient. The food after ordering took no longer then 5 mins to arrive. We ordered a double chicken with 2 sides. The chicken was very well seasoned and the dipping sauces were delicious. Great fries but the potato salad had too much dill for our tastebuds.  Overall will be back again and would recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing Union Chicken for a while now and decided to give it a try the Monday after Easter, since I knew that it wouldn't be busy. I was seated at the bar fairly quickly, but it took some time for someone to notice that I was waiting to order. However, once the order went through, the food was delivered very quickly.  I ordered the O.G. chicken plate. It was 4 pieces of fried chicken in a gravy with hot sauce and honey maple syrup. The hot sauce definitely added a noticeable kick and the syrup added a sweetness that I didn't expect. I thought the chicken was very tasty. The chicken was tender and moist while the battered outside was crispy. The flavor of the batter reminded me of battered fried bananas from my childhood.  Yes, it is a little expensive if you're comparing it to KFC. However, I think the price is right given the quality of ingredients and taste."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I love fried chicken.   Went with a couple friends. We got the whole Korean fried chicken with fries and Brussel sprouts.  Everything was delicious, the chicken is on he spicy side but nothing too over powering. As someone who does not ever like Brussel sprouts, I loved these. They were roasted with some seasoning and super flavourful.   I've been here for drinks before but this was my first time eating. It was great!"}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5/5.  Came here for lunch today and I got the OG chicken plate. My god the chicken was juicy. It was also perfectly crispy and fried without being too oily.   I also ordered a side of coleslaw. Meh is the only word to describe it.  Overall, the chicken was quite good but I'm docking 1.5 stars for the subpar coleslaw and slow service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving fried chicken so we decided to try Union Chicken. The place is beautiful! I really like their concept of fancy rotisserie although the ambiance is casual and the prices are reasonable.  The menu is very simple, chicken (roasted or fried), sides (fries, vegetables, salads), and desserts. We ordered a quarter chicken with cheese biscuits, fried chicken, and baked sweet potato. The food was wonderful, very nice flavours and sauces. The chickens are organic so  they're normal-sized, you get 4 thighs with the fried chicken which is more than enough. Extra points for having Ontario craft beer on tap. The bar is impressive too. A couple of boos for running out of French fries (boooo!). I understand their 'everything is fresh' concept (our server mentioned they don't have a freezer) but with a menu that's so simple (probably less than 20 items), how can you not have every item available? In summary, good food, good service, good beer, reasonable prices, beautiful location. We'll probably go back when it's warmer to try their patio, it looks really nice!"}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful visit at Union Chicken! I missed my go train and was stranded for an hour. The staff Including Julia did an incredible job to make you feel welcome. I wish every restaurant was able to give a warm,  welcoming vibe like this one. The entire group worked as a team to make sure I was seated promptly with glass of wine in hand! I look forward to the next time I miss my train so I can unplug and unwind for an hour at this gem! The food smells and looks incredible, I wish I had another 30 minutes to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Imagine marginally better Swiss Chalet chicken for twice the price!!  MMMMMmmm GOODY!!  Double leg chicken with no sides for $15, then add a side for another $6!  Ok I have to admit its fairly good, but come on!    Service was fine, and the restaurant is fine also.  I just have an issue with the value.  D"}
