{"text":"Great little restaurant with wonderful owner operators. Delicious and beautifully prepared Italian and Iranian dishes. Everything you order will truly be savoured. Bring your own wine. Our favourite hidden treasure each time we dine with out of town guests."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant with Iranian menu for lunch and Italian for dinner. Meals come with fresh hot bread, soup, salad, tea/coffee and Iranian biscuit. Flavorful dishes plated in fusion style. Portions are plentiful. The mahi (salmon) dish came with an exquisite sauce with red wine twist and the fish was cooked to perfection. Service was good and attentive. Personnel were very accommodating to my two young children and pre-split the kid's shared meal into individually played dishes. Highly recommend to try out if you are looking for Iranian food in a contemporary setting."}

{"text":"This is the best restaurant in this neighborhood, highly recommended. Try their Mahicheh Polo which is a Persian style lamb shank, yummi!"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood restaurant. It's got a warm atmosphere and the impeccable service you'd expect from a small family run place. I was not sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised. It's a unique fusion of Italian and Iranian flavors which is definitely not something you see everyday. The food was great, big portions & lots of flavor. Be sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekend....it's a small place and attracts alot of the local population of Victoria Village since it's smack in the middle. It does have a bit of a limited menu so I typically end up ordering the same thing each time I go. It's a BYOW place, so be sure to bring something."}
{"text":"a family run neighborhood gem and filled with local diners.  can't beat the warmth, food, and ambiance.  a table next to us started a lovely conversation that lasted through the evening where we exchanged well wishes, kisses on the cheeks - deux bisoux of course, and business cards.  enjoy large portions for classic dishes such as foie for veau, cotelettes d'agneau, and poulet piccata du chef.  the tiramisu is worth losing one belt notch.  tip: make rezzies and bring your own wine."}
