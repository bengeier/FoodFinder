{"text":"Only came here for desserts once and had a cheesecake - didn't have much expectations for it but it was soo good ! Super moist and creamy.   The whole restaurant was really well decorated and the waitress was extremely polite. Will definitely be back for a full meal"}
{"text":"Came around 11 am for breakfast on Friday .   Pros  - Nice service and very accommodating - she let me customize breakfast.  - decent setup  - clean  Cons  - The food is 5 out of 10. Wonder bread tasting bread. Deep fried potatoes did not taste good.  - couldn't eat the lemon pie after 1 spoon  - won't repeat"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Mirage.  Came here for the first time while picking something up at the Chapters for a drink and apps. Tried the pita/dip platter and their cheesecake.    They have a good selection of drinks and European coffees.   Their desert section was plentiful... different varieties of crepes, waffles, banana split, ice cream brownies, cheesecake. (Their website contains the menu with a list of prices)  They also have free Wifi, which is a bonus.   The interior is quite nice for a cafe in Scarborough.. but would be sub-par if it were in a busier area. I agree with some of the previous reviews... the lack of choices is a main reason that gives Cafe Mirage so much business.  Dim lights, music, cushiony seats. This is a good place to go for a date night or even girls night  just to chat and share some dessert.   Service is also good, but it got a little annoying when the waitresses checks up on you every 10 minutes when you're trying to have a conversation.   Overall, good place for dessert and coffee in Scarborough. Would come here again with friends."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about this place. Maybe it's just the particular location that I go to (401 & Kennedy) but everytime my friends and I go to Mirage, we always vow to never return. But we always do! And you know why? Because there isn't another hangout spot/cafe in Scarborough.   First of all, the service at Mirage is terrible. Waiters never remember your orders and they seem to walk around in a daze. One time, my friends and I had to remind our waiter three times for water. WATER. The place is always packed with students and the tables are so close together that it's impossible to get to your table.    MIrage has a huge menu with actual food. However, it seems to have compromised the quality of its food for variety. We've learned to never order actual food from here. Also, maybe it's just me, but I like going to places that actually bake their own cakes and desserts, which Mirage clearly doesn't.   I ordered the triple chocolate brownie once and not only was is lacking in the \"triple chocolate\" aspect of it, but it was tiny and rock hard. I WOULD recommend the waffles and crepes...but theyre HUGE so make sure you have someone to share with."}
{"text":"Never once have I been disappointed with the food at Cafe Mirage. I've tried most of the items on the menu - all delicious and good sized portions. Some of my favourites are the Tuscan Chicken (ask for extra gravy on the side for your fries!), Seafood Pasta, and any of the crepes! Their breakfast menu is also to die for! Try their Eggs-Benny. Best in town!"}
{"text":"This is the best place hands down for dessert in scarborough i always get the brownie overload! Never disappoints and great service !! The prices are also good and also their crepes and waffles are huge and taste good!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Went there twice. Once I shared the Perfect Couple with a friend & once for brunch. Both times were good. The Perfect Couple is great to share & CDs you both chocolate & vanilla to satisfy both cravings! The brunch was also good. Overall the food is ok. Nothing insanely good, but not terrible. They are also breastfeeding friendly which is GREAT for mothers with their little ones."}
{"text":"RACIST SERVERS  I was just there Thursday Sept 5 at 9:30pm for a late dinner with a friend and I am not impressed with their service. We were promptly seated but just left alone with no service. We weren't even asked if would like some drinks to start off with or given any water. 30 minutes after being seated, my friend and I decided to try and flag down a waitress so we could get our order taken down. Most times I tried, the waitresses just ignored me like I didn't even exist. I am absolutely sure they made eye contact and acknowledged my existence but simply chose not to take our order. They would just be standing near the kitchen talking with each other. The most infuriating part of my dining experience tonight was the fact that another table that was seated around 20 minutes after us got their food before we even got an order taken!  Around 40 minutes into our dining experience there, my friend and I decided to just leave because we were still being ignored and go to the Jack Astors at Scarborough Town Centre instead. At Jack Astors, the waiter that served us was much better in terms of service and friendlier. It was such a stark contrast in attitude and we were so satisfied that we ended up leaving a very big tip. Who knows, maybe the reason why the waitresses ignored us was because it was a table of two asian girls and they were racist.   Long story short, go somewhere else for food. You'll get much better service, won't have to deal with possibly racist servers and will not be ignored for 40 minutes. Also it was bad enough that I felt the need make an account to actually leave a review."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and I've never had a bad experience. I've been here for their food and also for their desserts. They are not a 5 star restaurant so don't go in with that expectation.   Everything there comes in huge portions. I've had their nachos (fully loaded of course), their salads, their sandwiches and their mains. The food comes out in a timely fashion. They have decent food. As for their desserts, you can choose to have a slice of cake that is displayed at the front or you can get a sundae, waffle, crepe and etc. They do not have a huge selection like Caf√© Demetres but I would have to say sometimes simple combinations taste better.   Their service there is pretty good. Sometimes it takes a while for someone to come by to refill your water especially if you are sitting outside when it's not as busy. No complaints though. Overall, I've always had a good time whenever I come here. The atmosphere is very relaxing. They have huge comfy chairs to sit on if you want. Good times with great company!"}
{"text":"We went in with a B'day group. Service was awful. Food took over an hour to arrive, after multiple inquiries. The pizza was burnt. The quesadilla was burnt. A friend of mine ordered a salmon salad and it was brought out with rotten avocados and NO salmon.   When we complained that the service we're getting is unacceptable, we were told they have to get the cops involved because there is legality in what we owe, even though we yet hadn't seen the food.  They then hurried our bills to the table, but had the nerve to out in gratiuity because we were a big group. Throughout all this we didn't get one apology which is all we were looking for.  Avoid this place. Customer service is horrible. The server staff is not friendly. And the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I politely asked to speak to the manager because I ordered the chocolate cake slice and it was horrible it tasted stale like it was in the fridge for months I was honestly just giving the manager feedback, but he got defensive and began to be rude saying he doesn't get complaints about it and a lot of people order it.. Personally if I was the manager I would like to have feedback from customers to improve my restaurant but he was very rude and gave horrible customer. I never asked for the cake to be free but he was saying you still have to pay for it because I took more than one bite. Disappointed"}
{"text":"The food was fairly decent. The ice cream deserts were good. Service was not super fast but our waitress was nice. One drawback was the seating layout inside the restaurant.  I went my friend and we were given a seat on the side of the restaurant and the tables were so closely aligned to each other that it was difficult to get in and out. Asides from that, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"NOT A GRILL!  Terrible live music who kept singing the same neo song over and over. Would have never agreed to go if I knew there was live music in the first place.   NOT A GRILL!  They try to have an upscale chic look with prices to match, then you open the menu. Pages torn and tattered, covered in stains. Then you read the menu items and realize you cannot order anything of the grill because this is NOT A GRILL!"}
{"text":"We have heard this \"cafe\" is an excellent lunch place to eat, so living close by we decided to try it. I am a sucker for homemade burgers! So- that's what I ordered. I have to tell you, there is absolutely no way this burger was handmade, it was tasteless, and certainly not juicy. I believe it came from a box! My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken sandwich and he was satisfied but by blown away. The server didn't even deserve the tip we left for her. It took 10 mins for her to get to our table, and another 10mins to get us drinks. And there was probably 2 other tables in there, including the owners. I was very upset at our experience because I was looking forward to this delicious cafe food. They give off an image of a modern atmosphere with a flare. WRONG."}
{"text":"I felt like I had to write a review because some other reviews here are...just too picky. Like someone complaining about slow service on BOXING DAY when they only had 1 waiter working (b/c their other employees wanted to enjoy boxing day maybe?). Dang  they should have called a pumpkin carriage too.  Here's my review  Pros: - Opens late, right off the high-way, perfect place for a late night snack - Good sized portions - Good wraps and sandwiches - Happy and friendly waiters (from the 3-4 times I've been)  Cons: - Slower service if they are busy, duh (and they usually are busy) - Tables too close together sometimes"}
{"text":"I come here rarely however I just dropped by the other night.  I remember back in the day when the first one opened on Yonge Street, a small Specialty Coffee shop, nothing really special but the locals loved hanging out there.  They grew fast and their service has always been pretty good and friendly.  A little pricey but what do you expect from a place like this.   They have become a dessert place but also have a good foodie menu too.  My date and I eat there last Sunday and enjoyed the food and the service.  Prices are a little expensive but very competitive against like brands.   The staff are friendly enough and the food pretty good.  The deserts of course are still the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service! The atmosphere was great, and the restaurant has a lot of potential. However, our waiter did not introduce himself until 15 minutes in to our visit, he \"lost\" our order and blamed the kitchen (very unprofessional), we waited 45 minutes for: spring rolls, nachos and a chicken wrap. Once we finally were given our food, the chips were stale and the wrap was clearly cooked using re-used oil/ pots with residue (strong taste of fish). We had to tag our waiter down to ask for the bill, and then he didn't come back for it. We eventually went to the front to pay since we lost hope that he would come, and he yelled at another staff member who was looking after us instead! Overall: nice atmosphere, terrible food, terrible service and ridiculously over-priced food. Never going back"}
{"text":"Great service. Brownie Chill with waffles ($14) is always reliable. The quesadillas ($10) are very filling and great to share. Found the Cafe Mocha Blanche ($5) to be very sweet. I love how it's open quite late."}
{"text":"Two stars. One because they open late and the other becsuse they have a patio to sit on during those late summer nights. Otherwise TERRIBLE! just terrible. If you're coming to eat here, don't! This place is nothing more than a cafe that opens later than most and has mediocre coffee and satisfactory dessert. (aanddd a patio)...  I've visited this place on several occasions, the worst being the time I came for brunch (gross!). Complete hit and miss for the food. I had the eggs Bennie served with a side of stomach ache. The hollandaise sauce was so clearly something that came from a powder pouch, the poached eggs were so tiny, the smoked salmon was the most disgusting I've ever had (a very strong fishy smell definitely not fresh). The English muffin it was served on was evidently far from fresh. The only good part was the potatoes (because they were probably not made in house). Nobody at my table was satisfied with the food.  Aside from terrible food, TERRIBLE service. I kid you not when I say we waited an hour and a half for our food at brunch. What's worse? They made us wait over half an hour at the beginning to get our drinks (water and coffee). Nobody comes between me and my coffee! When I confronted the waiter for our drinks she said, and I quote, \"I'm the only one on the floor, you need to be patient with me\". I'm sorry...is it MY problem as the paying customer if your boss scheduled ONE waiter on a Sunday morning?!  On another note, I came here for a study date way back and the waiter kept eyeing me because I sat much too long...Although I followed the status quo and bought stuff from their terrible menu every now and then. Oh, and the store was quite empty so..Ni excuse. I got uncomfortable and left.   Another time I came for a coffee date-Terrible idea for a coffee lover btw- They didn't have lactose free milk (too bad for me), no soy milk either and they didn't even have regular drip coffee....yes you read it correctly. No drip coffee.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Ordered a coffee and cake coffee had no taste, the cake tasted like it was months old and left outside. Im no foody but this place was so bad I had to write a review"}
{"text":"Definition of Mirage: an optical illusion caused by atmospheric conditions, especially the appearance of a sheet of water in a desert or on a hot road caused by the refraction of light from the sky by heated air.  I would have rather starved in the desert"}
{"text":"Great price for the huge portion they serve. And when I mean huge, it's huge! They even had a \"caution\" sign at the front saying they serve the meals on big plates haha.   It's a fairly nice place, a couple of friends and I went there for breakfast and I got the classic eggs Benedict  which came with lightly dressed spinach salad, a slice of cantaloupe & orange, and fairly well seasoned home style fries. I also ordered a caf√© mocha which came in a lanky glass mug.   The Benny's were  cooked the way I liked it, and the hollandaise sauce was OK, but I've had better. It would have been nice if the English muffins weren't store-bought tasting. I wished I asked them to toast the bun too... if they allow it. Maybe next time I'll ask. Nothing special for the salad, and the fries were pretty good too.  My caf√© mocha isn't flavourful as I expected, the espresso that resided at the bottom seemed like it was a sweet espresso syrup with milk above and topped with whipped cream. It came with a spoon, I assumed it was for mixing the milk and syrup at the bottom.   The server was nice, she kept checking in on us.   Ambience and environment wise, it did not match the food and the plating. The place seemed to mimic a lounge-type decor with dark furniture with chandeliers and renaissance-type paintings on the high side of one wall. I look around, and then I look at my large blue oval plate and thin eating utensils, thinking to myself... is this a semi-upscale cafe & lounge, or a breakfast diner? Maybe they're passing it out to be both, idk, but you be the judge!"}
{"text":"2 things, open till 1-2 am and that damn triple chocolate brownie. That  brownie cake is so rich and deeply flavoured your sugar fix will be beyond repaired if you catch my drift. Simply amazing. Go Scarborough!!"}
{"text":"Great food, love the patio. Ordered a gin & tonic & received a gin & soda, yuck. They did replace it and it was very good. My nachos were kind of soggy and i wasnt able to finish them.. but this place is very nice and their dessert menu is tempting!!! My boyfriend had a burger and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. I believe it had goat cheese on it and he's very particular with food so I'm glad he enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks and desserts. Beautiful presentation, and the food was excellent as well. The customer service was a bit slow but on par. I tried the speciality coffee, and waffle with ice-cream, bite sized brownie, and chocolate sauce.   Would love to come back here again!"}
{"text":"The reviews are slightly too well for this place.  It was... OK. Maybe it is because I didn't go here at the best time on the best day. I was here on a Thursday in the morning for brunch/lunch. The portions were on the large-side and I was very full. The taste was not the best - I could make something like it at home.   I also ordered one dessert because, of course, it is a dessert cafe. The ice cream was absolutely gigantic and it was delicious.   In conclusion, highly recommended for the desserts. The food? I've had better."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and I got some sweet brownie sort of dessert. It was way too sugary, even for my sweet craving. My friend got the breakfast platter and he said it wasn't great. The bacon was terrible and there wasn't much else to his dish. After we left, an old woman who left at the same time as us talked to us about how much it sucked, haha.  Probably never going there again, unless it's for some late night insanely sweet craving."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here! Desiree was the best literally running around that mother fucker like she was on a damn mission. Food wasn't A1 and a bit overpriced but her service and jokes make up for it slightly. Over all experience was great, food wasn't."}
{"text":"I came for valentine's day, the food and service, we're great on a very busy night. I enjoy the nachos and the had a great linguini. They have a very extended dessert menu. Is a family friendly place and would definitely return"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends while eating different kinds of dessert. We tried the mocha crunch cake. So so good. Good for sharing. The brownie with ice cream was a hit with the kids. Will go back to try more."}
{"text":"The chai latte comes in a longer glass which I found interesting. It was more milky than anything and didn't really have that chai taste to it."}
{"text":"Desserts here are great. The atmosphere is nice also. Good place to take friends to hang out and catch up. Would recommend this place for anyone with a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Over priced for what you receive, they say big portions to justify the price on the menu upfront but when you get the meal it is just fillers. French fries tasted freezer burnt and old. All you can eat appetizers is only dips and bread despite the sign outside showing different food options. The kitchen didn't look well cleaned, tidy but like it hadn't been wiped down or thoroughly cleaned in years with lots of black grease and stains visible from the dining area. Also found the staff to dressed less than professional."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, overpriced and the pretentious feel of the place is a turn off. As well, the staff tend to want to socialize rather than tend the tables. Not a place high on my list to return to."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at cafe mirage with a friend and ordered off the brunch menu. I ordered the New York Benny, and it was pretty decent. I'm almost ashamed to say this, but it was the first eggs benedict that I've ever had, so to me, this was pretty good since I can't compare it to anything. However since it was a GIGANTIC PORTION (with lots of potato too, all for $11 which I think is reasonable), it got cold after I was halfway through, and hollandaise sauce that gets cold isn't very yummy =/ However if you're a fast eater and not TOO picky, I think you would enjoy the dish!   I only had water, but my friend got a hot chocolate. It looke nice, but it come unmixed (so you see like a layer of chocolate, and cream) but since theres whip cream on top, you have to finish the whip cream before u can mix the drink otherwise you will have some spillage =/ . I rather they had mixed it cuz personally I like to mix the whip cream with the hot chocolate, it tastes nicer that way =)  I also had a bite of my friends waffle (yea I mooch), and it was quite good, but too bad it came with kiwis that were terribly unripe .Overall, Cafe Mirage wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. It was just A-Ok, but I'd probably return for the free wifi!"}
{"text":"Only came here because Starbucks in Chapters was full. Used to come here for meetings quite a bit awhile ago but I stopped. Never really had good experiences here, just use their area for office space hehe.  Last time here was horrible, on boxing day meeting with several friends to discuss a project but Chapters was full as usual so we headed over. No one greet us at the door so we sat down, the table beside us was not clean for 15-20 mins, server came to drop off menus at about 15 min mark but never seem to come back to take our order for another 30 mins!!!   We got our orders, I had almond milk, it was pretty bad. We waited for another 30 mins never to see the waitress come back. I had to tell my friend to get me a glass of hot water to water down the condense almond milk, by that time it was kind of cold.  I understand that when we came in it was busy and they only had one server but by the end it was pretty empty and the server did not come back to check on us. Horrible service.  The ambiance of the place was dark and cold. Not very homely. They should take cues from Macdonalds Cafe.  Go here if Starbucks is close and you are having a meeting. Don't go for the drinks or food.  Food/Drinks 2/5 Service 1/5 Ambiance 3/5 Value 2/5  ========= Overall 1.7"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and wasn't too impressed with their food or service. Food was pricey and was bland. If I were to come back, I would come for their desserts instead. It was hard to get the servers attention as they were always standing behind the counter chatting with each other. I witnessed at least 3 plates sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered to the tables for a long time. It's a good place to lounge and get desserts, but I don't recommend coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"One of our Fav desserts place. Me & hubby love to have their desserts. The chocomisu is amazingly delicious.  Its a combination of chocolate ice cream over Tiramisu. Its definitely for a coffee lover. Tried their Perfect Couple which is spot on delicious & good for two people. Over all great ambience and food."}
{"text":"I've been to this location numerous times. I usually order the Perfect Couple with crepe with a scoop of vanilla and chocolate ice cream topped with bananas and¬† strawberries. This is definitely enough for two people, but i have finished this on my own before as well!   On my recent visit, I tried the Wild Crepe where you can choose from a few variety of liqueur which you want infused in your crepe. I chose the Creme de Cacao. This is perfect for one person and I loved it!  The service is not always good. The few times i went the staff didnt check on us and merely just delivered the food. The last time I was there the staff was attentive and he checked on us to make sure everything was good and was very pleasant.  The price is not so bad considering the fact that the portions are decent. They are also open late, so it's a great place to go when you have those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"Located at Kennedy Commons, the lounge didn't exactly feel like a lounge. Menu looked good but we only went for desserts so tried the \"Chocomissu\" and a fruit crepe dish.  The chocomissu was more icecream than tiramisu, the crepe was ok. Ambience not great. Tables felt cramped together, chairs ok comfortable. Prices are affordable but was looking for a nice place to hangout and chitchat with friends but the \"lounge\" was loud and waiters crazily rished! Will not go back there!"}
{"text":"I really like this spot to meet up /hang out to meet ppl in scarborough. It is right off the highway.   Nice spot for a first date or meet up, casually.   the sweet things are divine, and so are the lunch sandwiches.   toasted tuna sandwich and tea =  happy jacintha. k.  I will always utilize this spot, but now on to my review of the north york location :)  took off one star cuz the service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here with their wonderful selection of desserts and drinks.  But what made my experience excellent was the server who performed her work with extreme care and consideration.  She had lovingly put our leftover desserts in styrofoam boxes identified with description and even a smiley face.  She whisked it away to the freezer while we finished our drinks.  She is also very efficient with settling the bill.  With such excellent help, it made my experience very special.  I will not hesitate to come here again."}
{"text":"Food wasn't very tasty. Had a Mediterranean Wrap which tasted very bland (no hint of the feta which should have given it some flavour.) Salad with it was over saturated in dressing. Let the waitress know that I wasn't happy with the meal but that didn't seem to matter."}
{"text":"We spent so long trying to find a dessert place open later than 10pm and found this place.   They have a lot more options than desserts but we only came here to satisfy our chocolate cravings hehe!   We got here at around 10:30pm on a Thursday and it was really busy. We ordered the Mirage Parfait and Brownie Overload. The parfait was made of chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup and vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream. The brownie overload was made of brownies, ice cream and whipped cream. Overall, the desserts we got were just average..nothing surprising, nothing you can't make at home. Probably won't come back for the same items unless we're craving something sweet and want a quick fix."}
{"text":"Took my dad here for lunch and it was really disappointing. Our waitress ended her shift after taking our orders and we were apparently not reassigned to a new waiter. The chili was worse than Tim Hortons. Seriously, when will restaursnts realize? Serve two things on your menu, I don't care if there's only one thing but don't try to hide canned chili behind a leather bound menu. You can tell that they're ripping you off because they give you the food and never bother to ask how it is. They avoid you unit you shout across the cavernous floor that you want your bill.    This place needs Gordon Ramsay.   FAIL."}
{"text":"Customer service was satisfactory. The nacho appetizer was soggy and stale. The pasta was not all that great. I would only recommend having dessert. Other than that the meals were not at all great."}
{"text":"Cafe Mirage is one of those restaurants that survive because of a lack of choices.  In Scarborough, other than the Bubble Tea places, Cafe Mirage really IS the only place to go for dessert.  The ambience is pretty unique, with European murals reminiscent of Plato.  The waiters are always attentive. However, when it comes to restaurants, the food itself overrides the ambience for me. And Cafe Mirage just doesn't make the cut.  From what I gather, they purchase their cakes, and while there is a huge selection, I find that their cakes are pretty blah, and nothing extraordinary.  Perhaps switching out their supplier would make me a fan, but I would definitely pass on their cakes.  Their coffees are weak, and their food menu is nothing exciting.  The only thing that would keep me coming back would be their crepes and waffles... It's their redeeming factor.  I would take Demetre's over Cafe Mirage any day..."}
{"text":"This is my first time reviewing a place so trust me when i tell you the food looks like nothing the description says; my salmon sandwich was falling apart and had NOTHING in it the description said it had. Also, the house salad looked very unappetizing as it arrived. When i had taken a bite it was very dry and the dressing tasted like it had gone bad. When i had told the waitress about my order (that did not fit the description they had on the menu, that was falling apart and was stale) all i received was a 25% discount on a meal that i didn't even enjoy; that was from the store manager. So not only was the kitchen service poor but also there customer service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Being the best cafe in Scarborough is like being an award winning vacuum cleaner. Regardless of how good you are, you still likely suck.This restaurant clearly has style over substance. The service whenever I am here is mediocre at best. The place is hasn't placed it's seat well. It's actually often a challenge to get to and into your tables.   The cakes are good here though. I don't know where they are from, I don't really care. The drinks are hit or miss, they can make a good iced cappuccino, though I think this might depend on who is making it. The coffee is brewed decently. It's not horrible and burnt, but not really premium either.  All of this being said, they are the best Cafe in Scarborough (for what that's worth). I do go here every so often after I watch a movie to hang out with friends. So, I guess it's ok.. for Scarborough."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here for years and surprisingly I've never written a review. Anyways, it's a cute cafe that serves not only sweets but savoury options, as well as alcoholic beverages. Has a decent amount of seating for a cafe, with dim lighting, and TVs too.   You really can't go wrong with whatever you choose to get. Everything I've ever tried here I've always enjoyed. Just a warning that the desserts are huge so they're definitely shareable between 2-3 people. The pi√±a colada is also yummy, so I'd give that a recommendation as well.   I believe this place is halal as well (I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it is).   Give this place a go if you're looking for a late night chill spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for ages :). MUST TRY: avocado milkshake, anything on the brunch menu, waffles and definitely their CAKE!!!!! I adore their chocolate fudge cake and their New York style cheese cake. It's cute for brunch with your parents, dinner with bae or girls night.   If you live in Scarborough and you haven't been here, shame on you!! Haha"}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here every time I am in the Toronto area. They have kiwi milkshakes that are AMAZING! The food is pretty good too, but honestly, that kiwi milkshake is what makes this place an absolute must for me. It also works out well because my boyfriend is a vegetarian whereas I am not and there are things on the menu for both of us. It is a little pricey, but not too terrible. They are also open pretty late most days which is really nice."}
{"text":"mirage[mi-rahzh] -noun 1. an optical phenomenon, esp. in the desert or at sea, by which the image of some object appears displaced above, below, or to one side of its true position as a result of spatial variations of the index of refraction of air. 2. something illusory, without substance or reality.  Cafe Mirage is not an optical phenomenon (though it may be considered a phenomenon in its own respect), and definitely not without substance. Cafe Mirage is the dessert hot spot that's giving Caffe Demetre some serious competition.   I usually hit the location on Kennedy (and 401) as it is my pre-movie (Kennedy Commons) spot. This place is very busy on weekends, and there's a reason for that! The menu is great, staff is friendly, ambiance is nice, conveniently located & lots of parking. There's so much to do around there that its even good to take a moment to relax and grab a quick cup of java (or drink of choice).  The following are menu items that I would seriously recommend trying for their awesomeness factor:  Brownie Chill - $10 Fresh-baked chocolate brownies stacked to the rafters with small-batch chocolate ice cream, fudge syrup, fresh bananas and whipped cream. Served on waffle or cr√™pe.  Blueberry Apple Orchards - $12 An old-fashioned apple crumble loaded with fresh blueberries, caramel sauce and whipped cream. Served on your choice of waffle or cr√™pe.  Wild Cr√™pe - $9 Liqueur-infused cr√™pe batter griddled to golden perfection, piled with seasonal fruit, ice cream and whipped cream.   Fudge Brownie Cheesecake - $6.50 New York style cheesecake draped in thick chocolate fudge and mounds of fudge brownies with a cocoa-graham crust.  Brownie Overload - $7.50 Fresh baked brownie chunks over Venetian chocolate or French vanilla ice cream, coated with whipped cream and strawberry pur√©e, caramel or chocolate syrup.  ChocoMissu - $8 Tiramisu cake, covered in milk chocolate ice cream and loaded with whipped cream and chocolate fudge syrup.  They also have a variety of hot and cold drinks, and a lot more on their dessert menu that is not listed above.  Would I return? Hell yeah. Cafe Mirage is so real I can taste it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. Stay away from the food. If I wanted to eat an unevenly heated frozen pizza, I could have stayed home. Bad service, dirty floors. Ugh."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible! Nothing was seasoned properly, the food was bland. Also, the food was pretty dry, seems like it's been sitting out for a while. The dessert was the same, I don't think they make it in-house. The service was the only thing that saved the experience. I felt bad for our server, who kept smiling and being attentive, while having to serve that horrible food that she probably wouldn't eat herself."}
{"text":"In Scarborough, there are no other real dessert places, hence the reason for it's survival.  European murals reminiscent of Plato line the walls.  Waitresses are always attentive. Food & beverage is alright although I really like their Avocado shakes as they are mixed with Vanilla Ice Cream.  They run the gamut of cakes & sweets but overall unimpressive taste.  Their only saving grace is their crepes & waffles... & in Scarborough the pickings are slim for dessert restaurants.  Decent local place to go to with dates & friends alike."}
{"text":"Great place but not the best food!   Mirage is a great place to catch up with some friends, its central, and located right off the highway!  With my previous review of Cafe Mirage I was hoping that this time around it could redeem itself, unfortunately not quite.   Though the interior has changed, since the last time I was here, today I decided to play it safe with their desserts.  I mean, how bad can it be.  Unfortunately I encountered one of the worse cakes ever in my history of cakes lol...Their mocha crunch was bland.  Though there was a bit of crunch in this dish, the chocolate ontop tasted a bit off, so bad that I had to put it aside :(  1/5!!!!!!!!!  Just when I thought things could get worse, thankfully their nutella hot chocolate came to the rescue, and somewhat slightly gave this experience some hope! Piping hot milk drizzled with some nutella inside is what I needed to wash down my dessert.......................  The overall place is spacous, clean, however their service can be a hit or miss!! :("}
{"text":"I rarely have a craving for this kind of stuff but when I do this place always does the job.  Its cakes, coffees and sweet stuff, you can't really go wrong but service times can sometimes be slow/"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really dark and noisy. I could hardly even hear myself talking. Their desserts are average at best. The last time I went, I ordered a hot chocolate. It was ridiculous. I've had better hot chocolate at Tim Horton's, quite frankly. The only thing I really liked their was a customized fruit smoothie I ordered. I believe I had it made with strawberries, honeydew melons and mangoes. It was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while so I must say some things haven't changed much. Sandwiches as always are soggy and wet... It's like they removed the wrapper and let it defrost. Gross.   The deserts I must say are quite good, but same thing with all my reviews too much and you're just a fatty. And probably leading yourself to Type I and II diabetes.   Whip cream on anything is good lol   Decor is dark. Service is okay. Nothing to scream about except that its one of the dessert places in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Seating is a little small and it can be a little colder than usual for restaurants but oh my god. This food! The drinks!  It has so much stuff. Amazing desserts, great set of cool drinks and salads. The food itself is a little more on the pricey side but like it's honestly not that big. So worth it your missing out if you don't go there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I only come to this place for dessert so I haven't tried out their menu items. Dessert is always nice but nothing extraordinary but service was very sub-par. Our server was not attentive at all."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in Scarborough for dessert, or late night eats and it does a great job of it. The cakes are great and the waffle plates are massive! They have a patio in the summer time which is great if you want to enjoy some outdoor weather."}
{"text":"I usually get the Brownie Overload and I love it. But overall, it's a pretty average dessert place. Very sweet, so if you prefer more toned down desserts, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't leave review alot, but this place deserves one. Came here on a Sunday noon for brunch, I decided to go with the mirage burger which looked appealing on the menu. My gf requested a BLT sandwich which wasn't on the menu and they were nice enough to special make it for her.  When my burger came opened on the plate, it already looked off. The Patties was breaking apart. My burger also came with no sauce but a bottle of ketchup. Same as my gf's sandwich, we had to request for mayo. After dressing the burger I took a bite and the reason why my beef Patties were falling apart is because it's mixed with too much breakcrumbs, and that is all I can taste. My gf has also requested a couple slices of avacado for her btl and the server asked if it was ok to have it on the side. When it came the avacado was cut in big cubes, how was my gf supposed to put them in her sandwich?   4 thumbs down for this spot. On the side note the service was good."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that went from being great to meh!  The service is either a hit or miss in this place. Once I had to wait 20 minutes to even get a menu after being seated!! The sad thing is it wasn't even busy. With that being said, there was also a time I was 30 mins too late to order from the breakfast menu but they made an exception.   The staff are alright although I feel like some patrons could be a little difficult to deal with that annoys the wait staff. The decor is great but some couches need to be replaced!  The food and drinks are great. The dessert looks scrumptious but I'm not into desserts a whole lot.   Word of advice: Be vocal or you might not get a good quality  (Y)."}
{"text":"The manager should really learn the definition of Customer Service. Here are some 8 Lessons for the Manager, Staff and the Owner.   We (a group of 12-13 people) called in and checked with the restaurant whether they are good to accommodate and handle a large group at this time & a person called McKenzie at the restaurant said \"Of course, yes\".   So we went to that place, ordered our food and waited for over an hour for the food to come. First, a few of my friends went up to the server and inquired and complained about the long waiting time and assured us that the food will be served very shortly.   The food that was eventually served was burnt (pizzas & quesadillas) and the chef forgot to add salmon to the salmon salad. So again, we complained about the quality of the food and the server said we are sorry and the manager will give a 10% discount. We asked the server to call the manager to our table because it is ridiculous to charge the customer for inedible burnt food - which to be honest was not eaten and was just left as is.   The manager never bothered to come over to our table and kept sending the same server.  So  LESSON # 1 Miss Manager if you are reading this: IF A CUSTOMER ASKS TO SPEAK WITH YOU, PLEASE SHOW RESPECT TO AT LEAST WALK OVER TO THEIR TABLE AND SPEAK WITH THEM.   On top of that, the manager had the audacity to add gratuity on the bill.  LESSON # 2 Miss Manager - DON'T CHARGE GRATUITY TO CUSTOMERS TO WHOM U SERVED BURNT FOOD WHICH THEY DIDN'T EVEN EAT   On our way out the Server walked us to the area where the manager was standing (because obviously she was extremely busy to come speak with us at our table) where the manager started giving lame excuses for the pathetic service.   EXCUSE # 1 - \"We make our pizzas 'well done'\" -  Lesson # 3 - If you are in the restaurant business, learn the difference between Pizzas & Steaks.   EXCUSE # 2 - \"We were understaffed today\"   LESSON # 4 - Set the right expectation from get go.   EXCUSE # 3 - \"At least You (Mr. Customer) are getting a discount. We are absorbing some of the cost, and you are absorbing some of the cost.\"  LESSON # 5 - Accept your fault. Apologize. Don't push the cost of your mess up onto the customer.  You served food an hour late + it was burnt + we did not eat it and YET you are asking us to pay? You are absorbing the cost because you messed up. Why should I absorb any of the cost as a customer? What is my fault?  And this is a CLASSIC response i get from a manager who boasted about being in the business for over 13 years: \"It is your fault that you came in here with such a large group\"  Yes, that is true - My bad for going there - never again!.   EXCUSE # 4 - \"Sir, if you refuse to pay, I have to call the owner or call the cops 911\" Really? Call the Cops? Give me a break!  LESSON # 6 - You are running a restaurant business which banks on customer experience, not customer extortion.   EXCUSE # 5 - As I pay (YES ! I paid! - Silly me!) I tell her \"I can't believe I am paying for Burnt Pizza and such an amazing customer service\". This is what the manager responds with: \"Experience is all about what you make of it and you made it shitty for yourself\".  LESSON # 7 - Look up the definition of customer experience on google or any dictionary.   And what happened after was extremely humiliating and disrespectful. The Manager lost her cool when I told her that she needs to look up the definition of Customer Experience and walked us out of the restaurant while screaming at us. And when we were outside the restaurant premise she followed us, came outside and continued abusing and screaming at us and calling my wife a bitch and making her cry.  LESSON # 8 - Customer Acquisition Cost is much higher than Customer Retention Cost in any business. You can get repeat customers easily if you treat them well. Learn the art of Customer Experience instead of specializing in Customer Humiliation to get repeat customers.   If anyone ever wants to write a CASE STUDY on \"HOW NOT TO RUN A BUSINESS\" or \"HOW TO RUIN CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\" - please visit Cafe Mirage and experience the \"bliss\" (sarcasm)."}
{"text":"Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure this place is identical to Symposium Restaurant & Lounge by Major Mackenzie and Kennedy Road. It had the same design with the art/stonework on the wall and it had the same terrible milkshakes and ice cappuccino's.   This review is only based off their dessert and  ice coffee drinks.  Iced Mocaccino $6.50 - It was so bad I only drank a quarter of it. For $6.50 I really expect top quality but was given the complete opposite. The drink did not have any ice so if you are expecting an ice cap like the ones at Timmies then I would highly recommend just getting an ice cap at Timmies. Its just a chilled hot chocolate drink with whipped cream on top. Tasted terrible (0 stars).  Iced caramel cappuccino $6.50 - This drink was just as bad. Same comments as above (0 stars).  Brownie cheese cake $7 - Didn't taste bad but didn't taste great either (3 stars).  Service was quick and friendly.  Desserts and iced coffee drinks may look pleasing but learn from my mistakes and don't order them.   They also have a food menu which I did not get to try but it can't be any worse than their iced coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Their crepe skins are pre made and cold.   The person who was making an crepe order for a customer and added whipped cream by mistake. He used this bare hand to scoop it off. He didn't even bother making a new one for the customer as other cafe/restaurants would.   The waitress could care less about the customers and would spend time chit chatting near the counters.    My cousin who is lactose and tolerant asked the waitress what were her options for desserts.  The waitress suggested her a cake and said it was dairy-free. Well it wasn't and my cousin ended up suffering in pain.   Terrible services."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time for an early Saturday dinner. We bought along 13 people to celebrate a friends birthday and were all looking forward to a hearty meal. However, we had to wait for over an hour for our meal to be served. The pizzas were overcooked and burnt and the salmon salad didn't have salmon. When we addressed our disappointment the manager did not come to our table to listen to our concerns. When we walked upto her to address the concern and experience, the manager threatened that we didn't respect her despite of the fact she's offering us some discount on the bill and escorted us out of the restaurant. She also threatened that now that she was out of the premises of the restaurant she could do whatever she wants with us.  All we were trying to explain to her was that money compensation and forcing us to pay for meals we didn't have or enjoy was not the right customer service. To say the least, we were humiliated.."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the desserts, but the Mediterranean food for lunch when I went recently was great!   I was introduced to this spot by a colleague and was pleasantly surprised! I don't usually have high hopes for anything in a strip mall. Mirage is a good spot for a quick lunch and has plenty of seating. I recommend the $17 lunch special which includes unlimited appetizers and your choice of entree (e.g. kefta, souvlaki, pasta -- tilapia and a few other items incur an extra charge). It's good value since most of the mains cost ~$14-15 on their own. Service when I went was polite and warm.   The unlimited appetizers were delicious and fresh!! Tossed salad (with a nice vinaigrette and nuts), tabouli salad, hummus, babaganoush, pressed yogurt, daily special (in this case, a spicy middle eastern spin on potato salad with mushrooms), pita bread, and falafel. To be honest, if there was an option, I would just eat appetizers because after all that I was stuffed!! They bring everything out as a big platter. For my main, I had chicken souvlaki which was juicy and flavourful.   Definitely worth stopping by for a bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We went there around 4pm and everything was tasty.  The service was very slow for the time of day but super friendly.  I found it rather expensive.  Not a fan of their string fries.  They were difficult to pick up with my fork as they are the width of 3 tooth picks.  I'd definitely come back but I wouldn't order the fries again."}
{"text":"Is really a good place to chill.. great dessert!! Love place to hang.. but a bit expensive."}
{"text":"This Cafe Mirage is not new and pretty like their Yonge and Sheppard one but it's still a nice place to go to for dessert uptown.  I've ordered many things off their menu and I'm never disappointed (okay, except maybe once). The portion is decent, the service is okay and the selection is great.  The one thing I highly recommend you not to get is the ChocoMissu. The tiramisu did not taste like tiramisu and it was just way to sweet even for sharing.  However, the crepe, cakes and dessert squares are really good!  Although I come here mainly just for desserts, I also enjoy eating lunch or dinner here. The portions are perfect for me since the sandwiches come with a soup or a salad. The price point is also very good!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The seating, environment, and food have been great the numerous times I've come. However I will say that the desserts are lacking--they look very impressive but do not taste that great. I hope this is something they will improve upon. Service has been great too.  I'd come here for a casual meal, catch-up with a friend, or a casual date."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place! Desserts are awesome, as are their smoothies and lunch menu items. Great house salad and dressing. My husband isn't really a fan of it because the 1 time he came, he ordered calamari and it was chewy...my thought is you don't order calamari at a dessert specialty place! I go every time I can."}
{"text":"Four stars for the awesome dessert. The North York location sucks, don't even waste your time. The chocolate cake I got was stale. The Scarborough one however, I'd like to credit my child bearing hips to the Scarborough location. I can't really remember what all I have had, because I have had too much. It was all divine.   I haven't tried their food yet, except for bruschetta and that was pretty tasty.  All the elements for the bruschetta come separate on the plate so the bread doesn't get soggy. You are able to put as much cheese and tomatoes on your bread has you humanly please."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I had a grilled chicken with pesto sandwich that was divine. Followed by the brownie chill which was absolutely delicious. The foccacia bread was soooo good. I keep telling myself that when I go back, I'll only have a dessert and I'll try something new, but who am I kidding? I totally need more of that brownie chill."}
{"text":"Just came from this place. Chef wasn't  there when we got there for 10am. We ordered around 1010 and didn't get the food till 1035z the food was good got the le grand Benedict and Victoria Benedict. Server was good but they need more staff.   Lastly do NOT order the green tea. One green tea is friggin $3.50. That's one green tea bag of bigalowe brand. I can understand 1.50 1.75 but 3.50 shit ain't even organic. The coffee much better at Tim Hortons or coffee time was $3.00 wtf ....wtf.  Stay away from the over expensive junky tea and coffee."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Love the variety of foods: sandwiches, pizzas, desserts, and so forth.  Why only a 3-star? Slow service. When I went, there was only 1 server taking care of about 6 tables and, wouldn't you know it, a huge group comes in for a party. I understand that if you know the owner, they'd be focusing all their attention on the group, and that's exactly what happened.  My cousins and I sat down by ourselves when for some reason it says \"Please wait to be seated\", we waited a good 15-20 minutes just to order. I don't know about other people, but when you see the customers no longer looking at the menu, that usually means they are done figuring out what they want.  I'd come back, but only because I like the ambiance and the food itself."}
{"text":"I've been to this cafe twice this month and I think I'll be coming back again to have my espresso shots or iced cafe drinks.  My friends and I have been stressing so much of picking the right cafe to study for the exams and we ended up going to these location last week. I got fascinated with the decorations and dim lights the cafe is using as it is not very bright nor too dark. The coffee table, paintings, counter, and everything else are perfectly arranged. We went there on a lunch hour ,so there were only a few people present at that time. The attendants are also prompt and courteous of explaining all of our questions about the food they are serving.  I would say these cafe is perfect for students who need a calm, quiet area to study, but only during the off-peak times of the cafe, like 1pm - 5pm, because after six, I noticed that people in corporate attires or work attire come over with their group of friends and chat. It tends to become busy later within the day so make sure you get yourself a comfy spot in this location (we prefer to stay at the corner right of the cafe because of the direct light and accessibility of outlet behind the couch).  The attendants display great customer service skills because they try to open up conversations with their customers and come to our table promptly to ask whether we need anything else before they leave. (I got so distracted one time when I was paying my bill and I forgot to give my attendant her tip -- sorry, if ever you're reading this).  I always order the cold drinks even though it is winter. I just find it more satisfying and worth it to have this drinks during my stay. It is a bit pricey compared to the common coffee shops such as Timmies or Starbucks, but you get what you pay for. The meals served are ginormous, the drinks are well done with extra attractive designs, and they come really quick to your table!  I say, give the creamy iced mochaccino a try (if you have a sweet tooth like me) to satisfy your chocolate needs. I also ordered the bruschetta meal. I wasnt able to consume everything because there were so much served. I tell you, share the meals with a friend, lover, or relative when ordering food from Cafe Mirage.  The wifi connection here is also satisfying. The download time is very quick unliek nay other coffee shops.  I have tried several \"hidden\" or \"looks hidden\" coffee shops in north york to study for my tests/ exams (like Second cup at leslie/ YM), but Cafe Mirage is yet the best coffee shop I've tried.   They also close late (PROS to us. hardworking students!) 1 am - Sat and Sun 2 am - Monday to Friday (I think). They open at 9:00AM"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls coffee/dessert with 4 of my friends yesterday. We didn't order any food. I was here a few years ago and liked the food, drinks, coffee, dessert, music and couches etc. Apparently the owners have changed hence, the different food and decor etc.  This place in the past is usually pretty packed so I was surprised that it was not as packed yesterday.   I had the Chai tea latte with Amaretto at first and ordered another chai tea latte without the alcohol. It was ok. The drink tasted a bit watered down. I am not sure if they used cream or 2% milk. Maybe I should have asked. Two of my friends ordered the avocado milkshake and they liked it. My other friend (a dessert lover) ordered the mango raspberry cheesecake and she wasn't too happy with it. It was a mousse, sponge and cheesecake combo instead of a regular cheesecake. Now she is someone who finishes her dessert no matter how big the cake slice is and she left half.   I personally wouldn't go back. I have had better coffee and dessert in the city at Demetres. I guess I need to do my research to find a good coffee in Scarborough."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was driving through Scarborough last Sunday, heading to Montreal for business. We decided to meet for lunch. The problem? We weren't hungry at the time.   Well, when we got there at 13:30, our appetites said otherwise. Originally, we thought of getting a light snack and beverage at the Starbucks in Chapters. We looked cross the parking lot and saw the Mirage. We went for it.   I had visited the Mirage in Richmond Hill for dinner years ago. I liked it, so I didn't see what could go wrong here.   We were promptly greeted and were asked to sit anywhere. We did.   My guy ordered the fresh Spanish omelette ('fresh' made me giggle, as opposed to frozen), and I ordered the French toast with strawberries.   We got our orders pretty quickly. My guy had time to ask the server what the wifi password was. Our meals were large.   There were some issues with our server. It wasn't particularly busy, either: - My order was supposed to come with soy whipped cream. I didn't get any of it, which isn't a big deal. I wanted to know what it tasted like.  - My French toast did not come with maple syrup. I had to ask the server for some.  - I had ordered a Diet Coke. It didn't come, either, until I reminded the server.   The food was tasty. There were a ton of sliced strawberries over my large, thick-sliced French toast. My guy's Spanish omelette looked amazing. He got a small side salad and fruit.   My guy also ordered a cup of coffee afterwards. I'd go back again for the food. I hope that I get a different, more attentive server."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take a date. In fact my fiance and I joked about how before we met we both had dates here at one time. Place is trendy without being stuffy. Chairs are a little chaotic but that allows for easy change ups. Food is very good but pricy for the size. The desserts and drinks are the main reason for going here which are also expensive but very good as well. They have several great waffle desserts available. We ordered a big one and the four of us together could barely finish it."}
{"text":"Considering me and some buddies found this place quite by accident late at night after a bit of a bender, Mirage proved to be pretty welcome oasis filled with sweet tooth rotting temptations!  Sure the clientele was cheesetastically douchey i.e. lotsa unattractive dudes with receding hairlines and wearing tight shirts, when they shouldn't be  :(   the decor  is rather Euro-crap and the facilities definitely could have used some spic & span-ing,   BUT I digress...  Between the outrageously (albeit delightfully) large and GI count massacre-ing crepes, like the Orchard Apple Blueberry lovingly drizzled with caramel and bookended with apple crumble bits (!!Damn!!)  and the berry delicious Chocoberry Delight cr√™pe which is crowned with chocolate and strawberry ice cream, fresh strawberries, chocolate syrup and whipped cream (!!hubba-hubba!!) Mirage definitely hit our dessert g-spots right on target!  No scoop of ice cream was too large, or dollops of whipped cream too generous, and caramel and chocolate sauce were splashed about profusely in wicked abandon, yep Cafe Mirage is like a XXX version Dairy Queen but for the 18 and older crowd.    Big shout out to Deborah our server who not only was super sweet and accommodating, she even offered to keep our doggie-bagged desserts chilled in the fridge while we finished our teas. I've dealt with many a server and waitress in my long history as a (high maintenace) diner, I have to say Deborah was en pointe and held the Mirage ship down like a boss!!!    Get your east side sweet tooth fix (especially the crepes and waffles) at Mirage Grill. Nevermind the Scarborough bollocks and just enjoy indulging in the massively \"so good, yet so bad\" desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Service on point, food on point, vibe is official, love this place.  My first time being at this grille and lounge and I loved it, we held a business meeting and still had fun, positive vibes all around and our server held it down all the way through!   Definitely will be coming back to this place 1000% loved it"}
{"text":"Yesss go to spot for desserts when in doubt ! Lol always a nice place to be in with the TV's to entertain us and cake to fill us up. Only thing is, ask for the cake warmed up a little because otherwise it's just hard and dry.. We got the chocolate cake and didn't warm it. Other food like the waffles and hot food, BOMB! It's a good craving satisfier lol."}
{"text":"Place is always BUSY - Go with Tons of Extra Time  We went to Moores and one of the employees suggested we visit Cafe Mirage Grill & Lounge.  The place was busy when we showed up and they told us that we would have a 20 minute wait.  Wrong - we waited for 30 minutes before they came and told us that we would have to wait an additional 30 minutes.  The place is small and cramped, there is no real waiting area.  The food looked good and the deserts looked great - just didn't get a chance to experience it because we left."}
{"text":"I got the apple blue berry waffle dessert - cafe mirage top picks - & it was really good and filling -Almost couldn't finish it.   Service was not so great; waitress served us water and took our orders in a decent time frame but after we got our food she never showed up to our table again.   Overall the place wasn't too busy when we went, plus the atmosphere is nice and chill."}
{"text":"Trust me, it is not easy to find a coffee/cafe place in Scarborough that is not Starbucks or Second Cup or Tim Horton of a bubble tea place.  I just want to go somewhere where I can get a cup of decent freshly made cappuncino and drink it NOT from a paper cup... Cafe Mirage seems to be the only option....  Mind you the cappuncino here is not cheap $5 but you have the privileges of:  - being served - relaxed in nice comfortable seatings - free WIFI - drinking from real glasswares  The iced Cappuncino ($4.50) I ordered was ok... not the best I have since it taste more like milk with just a hint of coffee.  I might come back if I am in the Scarborough area..since there are nothing really compatiable in the area.  They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Good place for dessert, since they have a large selection. I meant to split the ChocoMissu (tiramisu) with one other person, and accidentally ended up eating more than half myself :P I would have preferred a slightly stronger coffee flavour, but other than that the flavour was good and the biscuit part was super light and spongey. Service here was also great, since our waitress kept checking up on us periodically to see if we were alright and refilling our water. Would come again to try their other desserts and possibly also food. The atmosphere was lively even at 9:30 PM on a Thursday night (but not so loud that you can't have a conversation) and many patrons stay way past 12. Easy to get to since it's right off the 401."}
{"text":"They try to live up to an illusion of spectacular food, but it actually tanks. Depending on the day of the week and time of day, it can be either busy or desolate. If it's busy, don't expect good service at all. You're going to be waiting a while for your food so I suggest you head on to the burrito place next door instead. However, the times where they've had their lulls, the servers were kind, attentive and brought out food quickly.  The food itself is mediocre. For the price, it should taste better or have larger portion sizes. If I ever do come here it's only because it's the only thing other than McDonald's that's open late. I get the quesadillas which are actually quite yummy. Otherwise, their pizza is also decent. I don't recommend the breakfast or waffles. Their desserts are nothing special compared to other places. What's good about this place is that they're open late, they have a nice ambience, and they've got cozy seating."}
{"text":"Been here three four times....each time were not that good.....this time California Sunset crepes were hard, strawberries sour.....table was annoying because it was uneven and there was no waiter to attend to us so we placed a pouch of sugar under the leg to even it out.... patio closed early (8:30pm), way too dim in here, cant even see the waiters..... service is slow...."}
{"text":"I had heard their desserts were incredible, but I made the mistake of taking someone here for dinner.   Do not even think about getting their lasagna. It's heated up from frozen, and they don't even do that well. The person I was with had to send her lasagna back because it was still cold in the middle, and it still came back cold. On top of that, both our stomachs were destroyed by our meals. I don't want to go as far as to say I got food poisoning, but I was in the washroom a WHILE after eating here and it wasn't pleasant. It's been two days and my stomach still doesn't feel right. I'm never coming back.  The only positive note from our visit was the waitress who was pleasant and empathetic, but the food definitely overshadowed her aura."}
{"text":"I came back here for dinner, and the food was amazing! It was cooked perfectly.  We had the Quesadilla Don Pollo and the Mirage Wrap. The Quesdadilla is an appetizer so it's perfect to share. The Mirage wrap had mashed potatoes inside! It gave it a good flavour and the potatoes melted in your mouth!   It looks like the management fixed the seating arrangements, it is organized and there is not maze to follow to get back to your seat. My one issue I have for this visit was the service was a bit slow, but it was also getting busy with customers.   I will keep coming back here and I can't wait to try more desserts!"}
{"text":"Hmm.. what happened to this place? It used to be the go to dessert spot, but def. not anymore!   Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated quickly. One waitress handed over our menus, and came back after so long to see if were ready to order our \"drinks.\" We said yes, and before we could tell her about the dessert she already turned her back. Don't get me wrong, she was being nice, but seriously? At least wait until were done telling you everything so it's easier on everyone. Another waitress comes up to us and ask if we are ready to order, and we told her about the other waitress taking our drink order but we were ready to order dessert. The first waitress comes and she tells the second waitress she has us covered, and they both seemed confused on who should help.... The service needs to improve.  After our drinks and dessert came, I personally loved mine (brownie overload w/ vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup), but my boyfriend's dessert did NOT taste like how it usually does. He got the nutella cheesecake, and we always get this (no matter if I come with him or other people). It always tastes amazing but this time it was so bad! My boyfriend took a few bites and just left it. I decided to try it, because that was always my fav. and it was so bad! It did not taste fresh at all.  Only pros about this place was the dessert I ordered and the atmosphere of this place. It's a pretty good place to relax and catch up with your friends, family, etc.  P.S. expecting water once you sit down or a few minutes later? Forget it! You won't get it until you ask."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in high school and it's a great place to chill and have desserts.  Food is okay nothing too crazy and some of the prices are a little overpriced.    All in all a good place to chill and chat."}
{"text":"Nice place I loved the chocoberry waffle. Also triple brownie was good enough. I'll try other things later."}
{"text":"Decent dessert food, service isn't great... even when there's only 3-5 tables filled in the whole restaurant. Been coming here for years but it's definitely declined over be past few years. Dessert is really filling and worth sharing with 2+ people. Ordered breakfast and it took over an hour to come, plus only a waffle took an additional 30 mins too, while only one of us had our meal. Disappointing. They offered us a free slice of cake to make up for it. Service was still really slow and not worth it. Plenty of better dessert places around!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great spot: good food, excellent service and beautiful atmosphere! Not anymore: service is classless, messy, slow and food improperly cook! Too bad wish they had old staff and chef! What happened? PS. I also dislike when server wipes table food into the chair where my expensive purse is sitting! Wipe in a tray seriously!"}
{"text":"Even though it may be the only Dessert Cafe Scarborough has to offer it's still my #1 local go to place to get my sugar fix on. Dim lighting, small cafe tables closely spaced together fill a packed room with walls painted in European murals and tiled floors. Intimate ambiance and relaxed atmosphere make it a great date spot or group hang out.  This Saturday night it's packed as usual but our party of 4 is lucky to snag two tables beside eachother. The waitress seats us and hands us menus. Service is always prompt and friendly despite the bustling crowds.  The menu consists of apps, mains, handmade pizzas, sandwiches, an array of hot/cold/alcoholic beverages, and of course desserts!  We were here strictly for the desserts. Orders included:  The Perfect Couple - One side of the plate features a single scoop of small-batch vanilla ice cream covered in fresh berries and strawberry pur√©e. The other has a scoop of rich chocolate ice cream and sliced fresh bananas with chocolate syrup with a fresh made waffle layered in.  This is huge! Far too much for one person but delicious enough that you wouldn't want to share. Crispy waffles hold up against the ice cream.  Bistro Sundae with a double scoop of Chocolate ice cream served with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.   Bistro Sundae with a double scoop of Vanilla ice cream served with whipped cream and carmel syrup.   Double scoop.... it was more like quardruple scoop, massive but the ice cream was really creamy, velvety, and delicious and I some how managed to finish it all!  White Chocolate Biscotti - Triple the size of your regular biscotti, there #1 flavour biscotti delicious and draped in silky white chocolate, I can see why.  Mocha Crunch Cake - Three stacks of feather-light almond meringue enclose layers of creamy chocolate fudge and mocha mousse, adorned with enchanting swirls of fudge and natural almonds. A huge slab of cake with the most delicious combination of chocolate and coffee paired with crunchy toasted almonds and meringue. Definitely a heavenly combination! My favorite cake!  We also got 2 pots of teas and one coffee. Service was top notch as usual. Great selection of cakes and desserts. Everything was huge and delicious and plated and presented well. I'm always impressed with the friendly and prompt service despite the mass crowds of people dining here. It's probably  a good sign as to why it's always packed!"}
