{"text":"The food was tasteless. The waiter who's the owner brother was telling us how their food was bad and bragging about his long gone glorious days being a fashion designer with a 13000$/month rent shop.   Just disgusted!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly but the service was Super slow. We were waiting for the waiter for almost 10 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even full. I had to go up to the cashier and ask them to serve us but the guy denied. After a few minutes the waiter finally came to take our orders and made up a fake excuse. Terrible service but the food is acceptable"}
{"text":"Le menu du midi nous donne un bon choix à des prix raisonnable, J'ai goûté à deux reprises à deux mets différents que j'ai aimés. Bien assaisonné et de bon goût"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Vietnamese Pho, this is not the place to go. When all the tables are occupied by non-Asians and servers are caucasiens, it tells everything.  Waited over 10min to get the order in, another 30 min for the food.  A typical pho restaurant has quicker service. Also, when chopsticks do not come by default, you then understand their customers target is not for Asian."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here after several of her friends recommended it. The decor was nice and there was a lineup just to get in. The service was good which is why I gave another star above just 1.  The soup was good and so were the spring rolls. However, the main dishes weren't great. We had the General Tao and crispy noodles with chicken and vegetables. The General Tao's chicken was awful with cheap cuts of chicken pieces. The crispy noodles was much better but was hot went we got it and didn't taste fresh. The desert was awesome though. It was banana and the other apple deep fried with a sugar sauce.  The jasmine tea was good but the tea pot was rusted a little. Surprising because most restauration establishment use Stainless Steel.   After a few hours I got bad cramps and bad diarrhea. This confirm the not so fresh taste of the food. I don't think I would go back to give it a another chance because there are other local Asian restaurant's that are much better."}
{"text":"I would actually give it a 3 and a half stars if that was possible. It is very good food, in a clean, modern setting and with nice service.  The food was overall very good.   The special spring rolls were crispy and had that nice mix of meat and vermicelli.   The egg pancake was among the best I have had. We added an order of steamed rice roll (flat) and wrapped the egg and lettuce. Very tasty!  The pork chop on rice was well made as well and a very good portion too.   My only negative comment is the warmth of the pho. It could have been hotter. It tasted fine but I couldn't get over how lukewarm it was.  I then had the red bean, Mung bean, pandan and coconut milk dessert drink which was good. If had a little less beans than what I am used to but it was good.   I will be back.Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great service, well-priced, portions on the small side but very fresh. Crepe was delicious but grilled pork on vermicelli lacked a little flavour. I would return!"}
{"text":"Cute place, super clean with fresh made Tonkinoise Soups Service is friendly and bilingual.   Soup was huge, got the special for 12.95$ that comes with a little salad, fried dumplings and a choice of Tonkinoise Soup. Soupe was ao big that I could not even eat half, and I'm used to go eat it in few different places."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant numerous times and I can tell you that I have always come out  satisfied.   I came for lunch and tried their pho which has always put them on the winning team.   A pho, or any soup for that matter, must be served at boiling temperature, but disappointed today that it was not.  The spring rolls were delicious though and somewhat compensated for my drop of enthusiasm."}
{"text":"La meilleur Soupe Tonkinoise sur la rive sud hands down!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Not the first time I go there but definitely the last, I gave enough chances.   I always ordered typical Pho and spring rolls but the sauces and meat aren't consistent. Tonight, the chicken in the spring rolls didn't seem fresh as it was tasting weird, like an aftertaste. Plus, the spring rolls sauce was too liquid and bland. I was the pho would have been good but there was nothing special to it and the beef was again tasting weird. Chicken and beef vermicelli were okay but beef was definitely too dry.   Service was kinda slow.   Sad part is that the quality isn't always the same. At least they sell Marou chocolate, high-end chocolate from Vietnam."}

{"text":"Some Vietnamese friends introduced me to this restaurant- trusting that their food is authentic, family friendly and very well priced. It's part of the strip mall next to Kim Phat and Mongolian Hot Pot.  Great selection of typical dishes like pho soups, some grilled meats, rice, noodles, spring rolls, salads, etc. I got to sample a few things off their menu and although I am not familiar with this particular cuisine, I enjoyed everything I tasted. Main entrees are all around 10 to 15$, they have cheaper lunch specials too. Portion sizes are moderate, best to order a few things and share as you will not get full off one dish.  This is a very laid back restaurant, minimalist, clean design accented with green lanterns, bamboo decorations and buddhas. However, the shape of this restaurant is just one big rectangle- reminds me of a classroom, there are no divider walls or partitions, I found the seating arrangements a little odd, as everyone just sits very closely to one another and it can get very loud. It's packed on weekends.  Note, you can bring your own wine."}
