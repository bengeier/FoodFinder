{"text":"I'm sorry cucos, but your food got me and my girlfriend sick. We went on a road trip from Chicago to Madison Wi and eat there worst decision ever...  We spent 5 days sick. Sorry don't eat there..."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and enjoyed it each time. We were a little nervous because of the earlier reviews that weren't stellar, but it sure seems like a different place from the year-old reviews. The chips are toasty warm with good salsa. The margaritas are ok. The food has been quite good. We had some of the special dishes - left overs, even though we tried our hardest to eat everything up.
Give this place a try - you might like it as much as we do.
Plus, they have the soccer games on their big TV screens!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The value for the quality & quantity of food is very good. I really like their salsa, for it has a great flavor. My favorite entree so far has been their chicken milanesa torta. Also, for a unique experience you should check out their late night karaoke. I've been there a few times when it started up. I don't know much Spanish, but it's a good unique experience to listen to Spanish karaoke. There are some great singers that perform. Highly recommend this Cuco's."}
{"text":"This place is great and the pollo fundido was tasty and deep-fried perfection.  Our server, Diana, was friendly and very accommodating.  For example, we asked for spicier salsa and she whipped something right up.  

The frozen margaritas really hit the spot and after one 12-oz glass I was ready for a nap.  I live in west Madison now, but the drive is worth it.  Hands down the BEST Mexican place in Madison (and coming from Texas, I can tell a great Mex place when I see one)."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican fare - not spectacular but standard. Staff were great, attentive and quantity was good for the price. Try the horchata."}
{"text":"My wife and 3 children ate here last night for the first time and really wanted to like it because it is so close to our house and we love Mexican food. The table was so sticky that we had to use our baby wipes to clean the table for our kids to not have their placemats and crayons sticking to the table. We ordered a number of different plates to get a feel for the menu, and the feel that we got was terrible. We watched 2 tables come in and order after us, get their food, eat, pay and leave before we recieved ours. This normally wouldn't bother us that much but we have 3 kids ages 5 and younger and sitting at a table in one place for well over an hour to get the food that we ordered is not pleasant. The food was not very tasty, the restaurant lacks the basic cleanliness that you would hope some place that serves food would have, and the service was very much so lacking any personality or kindness that you would expect. Overall, we were at this restaurant for almost 2 hours to eat very mediocre food. Not worth the $60 and we will drive further next time to find a place, any place, that will want to have us back again."}
{"text":"From the street, it may look modest, but go inside to eat and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. It has a great menu with lots of things I want to try. On our first visit there, we had the Burrito Cuco's which is very yummy. I had an excellent peach margarita (medium, which is pretty big).  Bring the kids. We brought our 3 and 6 year olds, and their kids menu extends beyond Mexican into standard U.S. kids-menu fare such as chicken nuggets and hot dogs. Excellent value and service over other places in town. We plan on going back again and again."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews I tend to side more with the one and two stars than the glowing five star reviews. I've eaten there 6-8 times and have seen both extremes. All things considered,  I think 2-1/2 stars is a fair rating. First impression is that the place isn't as clean as it could be. Chips are provided - a couple times they have been good but more often have an unpleasant sort of rancid taste. Food quality is okay, average, nothing noteworthy. Service has been like the chips, sometimes good other times terrible."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Everything is EXCELLENT. The prices are extremely reasonable and the food and drinks are phenomenal.I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We were greeted and seated immediately. Chips and salsa arrived immediately after seating, along with a request for our drink orders.

The food was delicious.

My only complaint was the greasy smell on my clothes when I arrived home.  Apparently, the ventilation system could use a little improvement!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch around 1130am didnt leave till 2pm due to poor service.
They brought our food out 1 plate at a time 
10min apart from each other. 
Not going back...."}
{"text":"Update:
Wow! We went back and were blown away at how much this place has changed. Steak tacos - great. Chimichangas - great. Chips and salsa - very good. Margaritas - great. Kudos to Cucos

Original review:
We have been here a total of about 4-5 times and its went from OK to not so good. Just had cold hard shell tacos with an \"off\" taste, chips that were thick and the salsa tasted from Sam's Club. blah. tamales were OK."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants on the east side. The food is good but more Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican (but still good!).   The portions are big, we always have leftovers.   We've come here several times for lunch and dinner.  My husband gets a burrito pretty much every time we go. Usually I get something with shrimp and all of the dishes have been great!  Arroz con camarones is my fave. Fajitas are yummy and you'll have leftovers for days! Chips and salsa are average and seem to be different each time we go there.  
Service has always been great! And you can't beat the $1 margaritas on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I had steak tacos they were great. We also had the margaritas which were also great. The service was excellent and the prices were good as well. Overall I would definitely come back. Definitely a good choice if your looking for some traditional Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went here for Cinco De Mayo and I'm glad we did! The tamales are so good! Mango margaritas were delicious. The table salsa and chips were awesome. They had dancers in costumes performing, singers for entertainment, and a raffle with prizes (bottles of tequila, t-shirts, etc.). There was a bit of a wait time and the wait staff was also kind of learning as they went (you could tell some were new), but mainly it was because of how busy they were! They kept bringing out free pitchers of margaritas and fun prizes to accommodate the wait. It really didn't matter because everyone was having a good time and enjoying the entertainment. Parking lot was totally packed. I would go again :)"}
{"text":"For the price, this place is pretty good.  The staff is friendly and attentive, the prices are very low, and it's pretty much the only restaurant you can walk to from the Elvehjem neighborhood.  There's plenty of food on the plate, too.  

My only complaint is that the meals, while much better than Taco Bell or other fast food, seem very much like pre-assembled Sysco plates that are opened and heated, rather than something that is actually cooked on site.  The flavor is pretty good, and they do a good job with what they're doing, it's just a little hard for me to get past this aspect of it.

As someone else mentioned, the salsa tastes pretty good.  I think the chips and salsa are free with a meal."}
{"text":"Tasty food - the carnitas never disappoint. 
Long wait - we waited close to an hour for our meals. Not ideal if going with children."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often and we always have a good experience. The service is great and the food is delicious. I especially like the enchiladas con mole. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and it was great. The food was so good and the amount you got for the price was good. The server helped me decide what to get but I have a feeling anything on the menu would have tasted good. We will definitely be going back over and over. We have been wanting a small authentic Mexican restaurant close by and Cucos will be our new go to for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Having moved to the east side a couple of years ago, we never found a go to for Mexican, until tonight. A colleague raved about this place and said the food was as good as the margaritas. We are not big meat eaters, veggie options and especially beans served with entr√©es are crucial. We had carnitas enchiladas and chili rellenos (both served with rice and beans), horchata and a soda and the bill was about $25. The waitress was incredible and the chips (warm) and salsa were terrific. Will definitely be checking out the lunch specials in the near future too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food was poor. We ordered the nachos and they came out with completely wrong order. Then they tried again and delivered us the incorrect order again. The food was mediocre at best. Really had high hopes, but was let down. Will avoid this next time."}
{"text":"The staples of a good Mexican meal are simple good chips, flavorful salsa, beans and rice. Although they have nice crunchy chips the other three pillars are missing the mark.   The meats have one flavor- salt... Oh and dry. They were out of guac on a Saturday during lunch... That's just wrong!  The staff however is delightfully charming but not enough to make up for a lack of guacamole!  Location is convenient but the food is not enough to bring me back for more. I'm more of an authentic Mexican food lover than what Cucos has to offer. If you like bland and salty this is the joint for you."}
{"text":"I got pretty sick after eating here, first meal of the day - lunch."}
{"text":"My Mom and I dined here  for lunch one Sunday.  It wasn't very busy. Staff there were SUPER nice.  I was looking for a lunch menu, and slightly bummed that they only have their regular/dinner menu so it was a little pricey for lunch.  I had their Fajita Quesadilla and LOVED it. The veggies inside were cooked perfectly, the steak was nice and tender, the best part? It was loaded with cheese! (yep, I'm a Wisconsinite)  Sadly I didn't really care for the refried beans they didn't have much flavor and almost tasted watery, and the Rice was just OK. I would go back for the Fajita Quesadilla though!  I didn't have one of their Margaritas, but saw that they have them very cheap during the week at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and my food was decent. I thought my tacos were a bit dry and wish there had been a bit more flavor in them. I'd try this place out again, though! I'm all for giving second chances."}
{"text":"We have lived on the East side for two years and have never been to Cuco.  EXCELLENT food!  Excellent service!  Thank you Silvia!"}
{"text":"Had the molcajete. Yum!  Delicious mix of meats in a tomatillo sauce.  Love that fish!  Very different but great with sides in a tortilla!  My favorite more than enough for two meals!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, a good Mexican restaurant in a fun atmosphere. Beer & margaritas were good. It's been a while since we were there, but I have a favorable memory of it, time to go back for a refresher!"}
{"text":"Why? Why did we choose Mexican food tonight? We have been to Cuco's twice before. It is OK as far as your typical Americanized Mexican food, but in the past it was at least pretty enjoyable. Obviously third time was not the charm. 

First of all we were seated in this weird back corner, half booth, half table. The wall my husband was facing was about a foot and a half away from his face. It freaked it him a bit. 

It took quite awhile before we were given chips (mostly broken crumbs...we got the bottom of the bag) and so so salsa. Please please to all Mexican restaurants. Please offer a hot salsa. Trust me. There are plenty of customers that would love it. 

Drink orders in and then wait. And wait. Finally got our orders in. Second basket of chips came. We finally some whole chips. Savoring the small victories. And wait. Just as my husband said they must have forgotten about our margaritas, around the corner they came. Then guess what...that's right...wait....wait. Again...just as we're about to lose our patience about our dinner, around the corner it comes. 

My husband's plate was just shades of brown. Brown rice, brown beans, brown chicken piled under what looks like 2 entire sauted onions. He had ordered the dish before and swore there was supposed to be some greenery included. Later we looked at the menu online and yep...lettuce and guacamole were missing. 

The waitress set down my simple order of a steak burrito giving me the dire warning not to touch the plate because it was so hot. She leaves and finally dig in. Sadly while the plate is hot, my food is not. 

At this point, 90 minutes after we sat down we just scarfed our dinner and got out as soon as we can.

I don't expect much from restaurants like this. I mean the food is cheap but I do expect that the restaurant at least tries. I'm posting a photo of what I mean. If you're going to paint a wall...just finish it."}
{"text":"I don't like giving reviews too much unless they are excellent, so... the last few times we've been to Cuco's the service has been pretty good and friendly. The food has always taken over 45 minutes to come out even when only a few other tables. And always wrong. But today the service and food was terrible. Kitchen/server forgot several things to our meal, server rarely checked on us, even to take our order, and then took 5 minutes to get a soda refill (had to ask the bartender evetually), tortillas that never came out. Chicken was chewy but the carnitas was amazing as always I will say. In short, food mad me and and we watched our server walking around aimlessly in no rush at all to help any of his tables. I think we will take a break from Cuco's for a while."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the service was excellent - friendly and fast. The free salsa was good but very mild. Is you ask, they do have a spicier salsa. Portions (especially for kids menu items) were all much larger than we expected for the prices."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff and accommodating. I always order off a la carte menu but my partner is more adventurous.  Neighborhood go to  & relaxed."}
{"text":"The reviews for Cuco's are generally positive and we've had a couple private recommendations, so we tried it tonight.

It was a disappointment.  The decor is uninviting.  Flourescent lights reminded me of a laundromat.  Wall hangings were eye level if you're seven and a half feet tall!

But we came to eat.  The obligatory chips and salsa were quite ordinary.  I had chicken burritos.  The chicken seasonings were a little weird and it was waaay too salty.  The best things on the lukewarm plate were the beans and rice.  

Did I mention lukewarm?  Typically Mexican platters come with a \"hot plate amigo\" delivery.  Not necessary for these.

We were happy to settle the check and be out.  Not likely to return either."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place b/c it is so close to my mom's home. The servers were very nice and the outdoor seating area looks so cute. Guacamole was good and fresh. (Positive)
The sink behind the bar had dirty dishes stacked in it like a college apartment. Made us wonder what the kitchen looked like!  The burrito was super flat- literally looked like a quesadilla and it was very salty. Fish tacos were good. 
If I do go back I would just stick with chips, salsa and guac and try one of their drinks. And sit somewhere I can't see dirty dishes-"}
{"text":"The prices are great, the food is very good (when you're craving normal Mexican--you know--when you just want that heavy, Americanized Mexican), and the ladies' room is IMMACULATE.  Many, many points.

I had the Azteca combo with mole and a side of the guac. The guac was loaded with fresh-tasting cilantro--which I was really into. However, if you're one of those weirdos who doesn't like cilantro (weirdo!), you might wanna skip the guac.

The parking lot was packed when we got there (6:30pm on a Thursday).  The secret's out, apparently.

Our waitress was great. Even though it was very crowded, she made time to check on us and bring us whatever we needed.

I didn't have a margarita, but my friends did. The margaritas are super cheap. And my friend said she didn't think there was that much alcohol in them but her high-pitched drunk voice told me otherwise (I was driving, btw--don't worry).

As I said, the bathroom was IMMACULATE.  Major points, Cuco's.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We had the Fish Tacos + Chicken Tacos with cilantro & onion topping. They were both excellent and service was great.  I can't ask for much more than that.  We'll most definitely be back as we left very pleased."}
{"text":"Tried again today since it's close to work...won't return.  Female wait staff was unfriendly and again on a party of two, one order came out wrong.  Lunch chicken fajitas barely had any chicken, but had an over-abundance of peppers...thinking they should rename that menu item.  Neither waitress came back to check how our food was or offer drink refill.  We had to go to the counter to get our bill - we paid and left, we do not tip for bad service......and we will NOT be returning.  It's no wonder they are never very busy in a spot that should be getting a lot of business considering they are off of Hwy 51 with Dean Health Care and Boumatic right across the street."}
{"text":"Not a bad place get a lot of Mexican food for your money. My one meal was enough food for lunch and dinner. Stick with chicken - I recommend either the grilled chicken tacos or the fajitas."}
{"text":"We were there on Saturday at 3:50. Very poor service. Numerous customers complained. It didn't seem to make a difference. No management. Very slow and orders wrong."}
{"text":"Went to Cuco's today as it was lunchtime and we had an hour to kill before my appointment at Dean Clinic East.
Really great food and superb service! 
My wife had chicken enchilada and I had the Gordita (chorizo). Best chorizo I've had in years! 
My wife's food was great also, I ate her refritos friholes-outstanding!
We finished with the fried ice cream-wonderful!
All this for only $20!"}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic Mexican. Hard to find in Madison. Recommend the large Margherita, on the rocks.  Glad to find this family restaurant. Our new favorite!"}
{"text":"A+ in my opinion.  We just spend a week in Mexico (not our first time there...) and Cucos had better food than we found anywhere (Puerto Morelos/Playa del Carmen) south of the border.  The Cuco burrito is my fav and the margaritas are amazing.  We will continue to come back, the food is truly authentic.  This place beats other area Mexican chains BY FAR!  Keep it up!  Can't wait for the next time:D  My mouth waters every day when I drive past."}
{"text":"Mexi-can't

C'mon Cuco's.  I'm not expecting haute cuisine when I walk through your doors.  But is a well prepared meal with fresh, basic ingredients really too much to ask for?  If I really wanted poor execution and subpar ingredients, I would save myself the bother and hit the drive through window at Taco Bell.

Things started OK.  My daughter and I were warmly greeted as we entered the restaurant on a Friday night.  While the d√©cor was a little cheesy, the tables and floors were clean.  So far, so good.  

The complimentary chips and salsa were OK.  While not freshly made, the chips were crisp and plentiful as our server provided us with a steady supply of refills.  The tomato salsa had strange ketchup like consistency and the kitchen was a little heavy handed with the onion and garlic.  But hey, I'm not going to complain too loudly about free chips!

The wheels started to come off when the entrees arrived.  I ordered the $13.99 Molcajete, described on the menu as chicken, shrimps, steak and chorizo in a tomatillo sauce .Served in a hot stone with green onions.  I'll admit that the presentation of the dish was pretty awesome.  The massive stone bowl looked like something off Flintstone's family dinner table.  But when I pushed away the green onions and cilantro that topped the dish, I was shocked to see a cauldron of grease.  I know, I know, fat adds flavor.  However, I don't want my dinner looking like the Exxon Valdez beached on my plate.  If the kitchen could have rendered some of the fat from the chorizo during the preparation of this meal, it would have made for a more palatable entr√©e.  Aside from the extreme greasiness, there were other flaws as well:
* The shrimp were tightly curled (a sign they were over cooked) and rubbery in texture.
* The steak had a lot of gristle and was extremely chewy.  A little better knife work during prep time would go a long way.
* Poor prep affected the chicken component as well.  The small scraps of chicken in the dish were over cooked and very chewy.
* The tomatillo sauce described on the menu was nowhere to be found.

If executed with more care, this could be a signature dish for Cuco's and not the craptacular mess that I was served.  This was a massive disappointment.

The $3.75 cheese quesadilla my daughter ordered from the kid's menu was also was a letdown - a sprinkling of Monterrey Jack cheese pressed in a flour tortilla.  It didn't hold a candle to the cheese quesadilla we get from Los Gemelos (a crispy masa harina pocket crammed full of melted Oaxaca cheese).  The fries that came with the meal were so bad she left the majority on the plate untouched.

There were a couple of positives.  Our server was energetic, personable and extremely attentive.  And the guacamole served with my entr√©e was outstanding.  But with so many other strong Mexican food options available to me in the area, those positives won't be enough to draw a return visit."}
{"text":"The service is top of the line in this restaurant, it makes me feel at home. We have been here at couple times now and we are always welcomed with a big smile. We are taken care by the owners most of the time, they won't settle until you are completely satisfied! Absolutely LOVE the food too!"}
{"text":"Yeah, another Mexican restaurant. You won't find anything exciting here. But the food is solid, fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Taqueria Guadalajara it is not :(.
But honestly, what would compare? Mexico City? 
I had 4 taquitos but couldn't polish them off... super oily and the meat had little flavor. Just found myself going through the motions (chewing) and finally gave up. Chips are good, salsa reminds me of some weird sort of mix of tomato sauce from a can with onions and garlic, and I'll give them points for the guac, that was fresh and had nice flavor. And the staff, the staff is incredible, which is why it's hard to write this and steer folks other places in town, but after subsequent trips, I think I'd be cuco to give them another try when Madison is home to Mex that's a bit better."}
{"text":"We love going here.  Service is great and so is the menu (that I wish they had online)."}
{"text":"We enjoyed both our meals (Taquitos and Chile Rellenos).  Guacamole is great as are the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"To start, the server was less than energetic. The salsa was very plain. The chips?  where not so good and very skimpy for a family of 4.  We had to ask for more 3 times, each time it came back half full.  The beer was about 55 degrees.  I had the Cuco's burrito, very average tex-mex, better than Taco J's or the bell.  I should give them 2 stars but I'm giving them the benefit of being an \"off\" night for them."}
{"text":"I work in a kitchen as a cook and my shoes are probably more tender and flavorful than the steak they served me tonight, have some pride cooks, if the food you served looks like garbage then it belongs in the garbage, don't matter if you are busy or not , as a kitchen manager I would never allow food like that out of my kitchen.
Sad to say  Mc Donalds steak sandwich looks better.
But hey the chips were great!!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night for dinner.  The place looks great!  Tortilla chips & salsa hit our table the same time we did, and were both refilled.  Our waitress was a sweetie.  The food was really good!  Prices very reasonable, portions big.  We will be going back."}
