{"text":"I like the place for cocktails, but it has a horrible menu - sandwiches and salads.  The food is not great either.  Needs a new chef/menu.  Good atmosphere for drinks.  

Lots of smokers on the back patio - ugh."}
{"text":"This place makes me so irate. There aren't a lot of places in the Phoenix area that have this much potential and squander it without effort. One of the best patios in the city, decent happy hour (although they are very overpriced when it isn't happy hour), boche ball, and live music on Sundays. I say that to say this. Probably the worst customer service in Arizona. It doesn't matter what day of the week or time of day I go. Busy or slow, hot or cold, I can't believe how poorly this place treats it's customers. It's almost like they think it's a privilege to drink there. I try the place about once every couple months and it has become a game with our group of friends to see how long it will take to get service and how many times our waitress will roll her eyes at us. The place is like spaghetti-o's...you forget how much you hate it so you remind yourself a couple times a year."}
{"text":"The 5 stars based completely on our service this evening. We didn't have any food just wine, but our bartender Reggie was probably the best we have ever encountered, no exaggeration. We stopped by the Vig for a drink after dinner and the service we received truly made our evening. With a friend visiting from out of town, we had the pleasure of finishing our night experiencing impeccable service and a person whom left us wanting to come back and visit this establishment soon. Thank you, Reggie, it was a pleasure meeting you."}
{"text":"Showed up just a little before 10am for Sunday brunch.  The hostess was very nice and let us in even though they hadn't opened yet. (+1).  We had our choice of outdoor seating, football was already on and the staff was fantastic.  We just finished hiking Cambelback and I was ready for coffee and a good breakfast.  I can't say enough great things about the service and the staff.  My friends and I had an excellent time."}
{"text":"The food is good but the atmosphere is better.  A great place for a Friday Happy Hour after work or a Sunday Bloody Mary and live music."}
{"text":"The service is good and the atmosphere is great.  Just a relaxed vibe with good drinks and food.  Unfortunately, the parking is bad unless you could possibly get there at an off minute."}
{"text":"Excellent grown-up bar. Average age most times of the day: probably 35 years. Music is not cranked to deafening levels, one can actually expect to be able to have a conservation here. Great happy hour food specials. And, I realize this is a blasphemy, but it is just possible they have the best pad thai going. Great salads as well. Good assortment of microbrews"}
{"text":"Loved the place!  has nice decor, very modernized look, the patio with area for band play was nice.  It even had a Bocce court, which I had a very good close match with my cousin was a fresh appeal to anyone who might want to have a good time while mingling.  The Staff was appreciative.  Worthwhile to visit if ever in Phoenix.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was staying right around the corner from this place in Phoenix, Called ahead and just got a burger to go. Should have been simple, too bad the bun was so soggy it seemed like it had been dropped into a sauce (maybe stock) or something. Totally inedible. Was too busy to go back though so just ate the unseasoned french frys.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Great drinks great value, hip atmosphere.. my standard go to in Phx. They're cocktails are good, Balanced and flavorful. Nice wine list, idk about their beers. their happy hour is great and good deal if with 3 or more ppl. Cute patio area, on hot days the misters going and its shady.. Service is always friendly and consistent each time I've been here. Friends and I get the charcuterie board which has good portions enough for four.  Nice casual spot to hang with friends, especially if they are indecisive about food/drink choice."}
{"text":"Farewell to Phoenix Vig  for a while... We move up to Flagstaff and will miss you! Came in and saw Jason on our last night in Phoenix- and a new bartender (can't remember your name so sorry!) Had our signature achiote salmon, burger, and ceviche with a bottle of Spanish red. Hope to see you all soon... thanks for the good times... PS Jimmy you're the best!"}
{"text":"Good food, location and the patio is cool. Fish tacos and hot chick sandwich are my favourites"}
{"text":"Fun place for evening drinks!  Visited with a group of friends on a Friday night.... and while it was busy we were able to find our own 'space.'. The prices were reasonable and the servers were very friendly.  Cool atmosphere with a upper 20s crowd, it felt upscale but not try hard.  Good experience."}
{"text":"The Vig...where the flies are more popular than the people (if you seat outside) however I Loved my steak and eggs! The Steak was an exquisite piece ..tender and delicious..
I wish they could do something to contain the flies ! This place would be more than amazing"}
{"text":"I have always had a decently good time at The Vig. I went on the Tuesday Trolley that did an Indian School Bar crawl every Tuesday night.

The food was great and the kitchen was open pretty late. The bar staff was mostly helpful but the thing that did it for me was the HUGE patio they have. It's beautiful and they have a DJ or other music playing and bocce ball!

The whole building is pretty amazing and I love taking friends to it who have never been!"}
{"text":"This place makes me laugh, its not a bad joint, but its kinda cheesed out, they claim its a \"modern tavern\" (who does that) I guess because they have exposed brick walls and green light up shit outside, but as far as food and drinks its not so modern or stylish, boring is the best word to describe it. The outside is great, I mean bocce ball wasted at 1:37 on saturday is awesomely dangerous, and they have this vig rigg which will take you home for free (so so def) anyway go for some drinks and throw heavy balls at smaller white ones you'll have a good time. 

Oh yeah i think on sundays they have half off all bottle of wines, so go get krunk and make out with some peeps."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service sucked! Our server 'Ceasar' was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered, that was the last time we saw him. I have never, ever....ever been somewhere that let's a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea, which both happened. The busser actually filled my husband's tea, and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal.
It is a shame, because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items, like we were going to order dessert, but due to the neglect we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Vig is AWESOME! I went to The Vig tonight with a friend and both of us were very pleased. The service was great! Our waitress was very nice and attentive. I had the trifecta and my friend had the fish tacos and both of us thought our food was delicious! We were there for about 3 hours and it was very pleasant the entire time. I will absolutely go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight and it wasn't too crowded, but perfect for getting drinks after school/work.  Had a glass of wine called kung fu girl, nachos, and mac n' cheese. The mac n cheese was sinfully delicious.. seriously, it was so creamy and rich, I felt my waistline expanding, but it was too good that I couldn't stop myself.  It was a little too creamy and salty for my liking, but that's because I like to eat a little on the light side.  The nachos were to die for- the pulled pork was a surprisingly good combination with the regular nacho toppings- definitely didn't see that one coming!  I'm waiting for a good occasion to try this place again; nice little romantic date spot I'd say ;)"}
{"text":"Like going on Monday's. Happy Hour for drinks and apps then at 6pm their Burger Special. Sundays are cool too, when they have live music on their patio."}
{"text":"I despise the lack of half stars on these reviews. I dig The Vig, but I'm not sure I can say I 4-star dig The Vig (it's really close though).

We've been frequenting The Vig since they opened, yet another destination spot in the neighborhood. Let me tell you how excited I am that their Central location is siphoning off some of the customers ... it's slightly less crazy up in there. Yes, I'm a curmudgeon, I admit it.

The Vig's food, though a little limited in options, is all fresh and satisfying. Sunday I had the grilled chicken sandwich with the mixed fries. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the veggies crisp and everything competently prepared. Big props especially for the $5 Bloody Marys ... it's what earned them that 4th full star. Just the right amount of spice and not too boozy.

We usually visit for dinner, and my husband was convinced they did brunch on Sundays. They do not. However, they did have one special \"breakfast\" sandwich, or you can get the burger with an egg on it for an a.m. protein fix."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place... great staff, good food, live music and an assortment of people that you enjoy hangin out with. So glad they changed the menu, cuz us non carnivores need more choices. See you on Funday Sunday."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The first time I came for dinner with a friend. I don't recommend the five spice edamame. It's just weird. I don't like cinnamon on my edamame. The hot chick sandwich is pretty good as well as the fries. Our server very accomodating.  The second time I sat at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and made great drinks for me and my sis. The Vig has a cool vibe. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great decor. Impossible to find parking, though. You can valet, or risk parking across the street (which signs forbid).

My roommate likes the burgers with the pretzel bun. They are really good. You have to ask for them now, since they aren't on the menu anymore.

The waitress charged me twice as much tip as what I put on the receipt (40% instead of 20%). I called once and was told that it would be taken care of within two weeks. Nothing. Called again. This time they tracked down the receipt and verified that I'd been overcharged. They refunded half the tip back to my credit card. As far as I know no one else in my group was overcharged. Keep your receipts and verify that you're charged properly."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Good food for the money - but it was definitely not one of my favorites. The atmosphere is only so-so too. You must make sure to get dressed up before coming here, which I don't mind, but I also am not always into that sort of scene. 

I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"The vig is pretty cool. I like the dj's and the bocchi ball. The waitresses are kind of stupid though, and the bartenders don't know shit about mixology. It's okay though. I love the food."}
{"text":"The Vig is a fantastic neighborhood bar and hang-out, located near Arcadia. Tucker did a great job with the design and the menu. The food is very good. They have great Edamame and Apps. I love the Smoked Salmon. If you like Bocce Ball, the Vig has it. The atmosphere is laid-back and the ambiance is nice. The Vig is always playing a great selection of music from different eras. The weekend DJ is always smiling and having a good time. He manufactures great sound."}
{"text":"Loved the comment about Adonis DNA by ruggy j. Classic (for the next two weeks, anyway).

This place (in Arcadia) feels urban-hipster meets ultra lounge, but only because the dark bar area makes you feel hugged in anonymity, the booths create a sense of intimacy, but as you get closer to the windows and patio, the space opens up and feels far more festive.

On a dreary Thursday, I met a friend for Happy Hour to work through the day's torment, and was pleasantly surprised by $3.50 pints of Deschutes's Mirror Pond Pale Ale on tap! Yay, Happy Hour, and yay, draft Mirror Pond!  Surprisingly, I found myself scanning the bar menu and decided to snack on something while enjoying my frosty beverage.

Lo, and behold: Half-price noms!  The Trifecta was for me (three sliders with fries), and I was not disappointed with the pile 'o' fries and the tasty burgers.  A filling snack for the price of a USD Lincoln, and it kept me sober for the next two rounds to follow.

Our bartender was top-notch, with incessantly-fast service without hovering. (Thanks for not being there when I made my controversial remarks about wait staff, BTW!)

Short-and-sweet: Good food, marginal parking, excellent people-watching."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Amazing food! I am obsessed with their mac and cheese and the atmosphere outside is great! I love their outdoor patio, the servers are always friendly and as a plus you can play corn hole outside!"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised when my VigAzz Burger, fries, and brew came to a non-whopping $10 and a few cents...Turns out this is a special: 

\"Every Monday, your choice of either The Vig AZZ, Arcadia or Burger Du Jour regular or sweet potato fries for $5  4 to close. Dine in only.\"

Great modern atmosphere!! our waitress was super nice and accommodating when it came to splitting up the bill. I will definitely go back!

i like."}
{"text":"The Vig sucks!!! The manager at this establishment, Pam, kicked me out because her bad excuse for a waitress, Kate Lynch, was so inappropriate as to tell my friends mean things about me. This was not only inappropriate but unneccessary. She did NOT need to tell my friends anything!  For me to get kicked out as a result of this is absurd!  I would urge everyone to not go to the Vig! It is a BIG mistake to ever go to the Vig, the more people I deter from going there the better! Maybe it's time to break out the markers, make signs and pickett the place so that everyone knows just how unfair it was to kick out a customer because their waitress felt like getting even."}
{"text":"There's this love/hate thing I have with The Vig...

First of all, I love the environment. They've done a great job of turning the old Wrong Number Lounge (yes, that was it's real name. You HAVE to love that.) into an uber-trendy hot spot, complete with an awesome outdoor fireplace and great drinks. It's a great, great spot to take out of towners and sit outside during our beautiful Arizona winter. 

BUT, it's bordering on Scottsdale/frat boy/cougar-land. Invading my beloved Arcadia. 

I can deal with that.

It's the food that's the problem.

The minced up chicken sandwich, in particular. (Not sure what else to call it.)

I asked the waiter if I could get it without the these days prerequisite pears included, which in my imagination, were sliced on top of it or something. His response? \"No. It's all kind of ground up together in the chicken.\"

Ground up, indeed. The sandwich came and it was this chicken pieces, press board kind of filling. It was really dang gross and reminded me of a scene from Sweeney Todd. I'm REALLY easy-going about food and it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. I kept thinking about it later and throwing up a little bit in my mouth.

Having said that, I do keep going back. Even though I'm going to die crossing 40th Street one day. 

Just stay away from that chicken sandwich. Weird, man."}
{"text":"Sent me home with a chicken meal instead of the vegetarian one I ordered and I didn't notice until I got home. Couldn't eat it and it was like 118 degrees outside so I decided to not go back. 

Called and let them know about this and the girl I talked to apologized and expressed her sympathy for me and told me that a manager would call me back to take care of this...

Never happened.  Seriously can't stand when people or businesses say they are going to do something but don't. The food is not awful, but this is a part of the \"Service Industry\" not the we forgot about you after we effed up your order industry. 

won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I always felt the wait staff were friendly and welcoming.  The prices are reasonable, the food has always been good [especially those Thai wings - yum!], and the decor is really nice.  Recommended for lunch, happy hour, or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"The service is always bad but today it really took the cake. we ordered chips and salsa for $10 with guacamole. We asked for a refill of chips and salsa and we found out they charged us $10 for the refill.  We had a grand total of two beers, chips and salsa, and an $11 appetizer. Our bill however was $47. This is not atypical, this is what I experience every time. The only thing, and I do mean only... Is a very nice patio. They don't have very good drinks, they don't have very good food, and the beer isn't even cold. TAC onto that the prices are not favorable. Let me just go check Yelp... Yup there's about 50 other places within half a mile. Later Vig."}
{"text":"Was referred to the Vig by the host at the Holiday Inn.  Was obviously very skeptical.  However, the atmosphere and the food at the Vig are awesome.  Would definitely recommend to any of my fellow business travelers who refuse to eat at the airport hotel dining rooms for anything other than breakfast.  
Excellent food, excellent atmosphere.   Looking forward to checking out happy hour."}
{"text":"I had been to The Vig (this same location) a long time ago and remembered not being impressed, but wanted to give them another shot.  Met a friend there for dinner and drinks since we were nearby.  The service was decent.  There was some chick there singing out on the patio and, yes I know she's an \"artist\" but she was not that great to listen to (read: sang like a hyena) and it was VERY distracting and annoying.  

The entire parking lot is blocked off for valet only, which irritates the crap out of me.  You have to park across the street and play Frogger to get to the restaurant, unless you want to pay some punk to park your car 10 feet from where you pulled up.  If they wouldn't block off the parking lot for valet, there would have ben PLENTY of parking (there were maybe 10 cars).  Literally just a cash grab. I do not just throw my keys to some schmuck for the heck of it, and give him $$ on top of that.  

The Prime Vig Dip was on a super crusty roll (they toasted it but perhaps left it in too long), and the prime rib was cold, dry, and bland. I hate to say it, but I've had better Prime Dips at a food truck.  

I'm writing The Vig off - there are many other places very close by that have better food, and won't force you to valet just so someone can make a couple more bucks.  Again, the service was decent (not great) but everything else was ho-hum."}
{"text":"When the Vig opened, we all thought we'd died and gone to heaven. Someplace this cool, and we don't have to drive for a half hour to get there?? Oh man. Bocce in the back, strong drinks, they light incense to keep it smelling sweet despite the still-in-renewal locale, what could be bad about this?

Now it's part of a movement, and not the shiny new penny in the bunch, but it still has a warm place in my heart. 

They have great happy hour, the patio with a fireplace is warm and inviting, and the interior of the bar has deep booths and sports on the tube. It's not the British Museum, but you just might want to plan an assignation here."}
{"text":"You don't go wrong with The Vig.
Outdoor. Indoor. Meals. Snacks. Drinks. Dinner. Late night. Big group. Small group. Whatever. Its very accomodating. 

Probably the best patio in Phoenix.
Everyone I know loves it."}
{"text":"Well... even after not visiting the Vig for almost a year everytime I go there it is a great crowd... I don't think I have ever had a bad time or met anyone completely rude. Sunday is the best day to go.. Sunday Funday! 1/2 price wine + good company + live music - who could ask for more? 

I'm normally a mixed drink drinker... but whenever I go to the Vig I always go back to wine, so I can't comment on the mixed drinks, food is decent but what doesn't taste good when your starving and drinking? 

Also heard they are opening another one on 16th street... double the fun!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here because I'd heard good things. Had the steak salad and it was the worst salad I have ever eaten! The greens tasted old, the steak was cold and the dressing was bland. Way over priced for such a poor quality dish.  Service was mediocre. The mandatory valet was a joke because the entire parking lot was nearly empty.
I won't go back."}
{"text":"Late Thursday lunch at the Vig for about 20 people out at the patio, we all left with a satisfied smile.

Vig has a rather larger patio than I expected, it gives you a very cozy feel with the big tree in the middle, the fireplace and the couches nearby. The inside seating seem to be quite dark as I just walked by. The first glance of its menu is somewhat random, to my opinion, I wasn't sure what is what, but then I was all confused on what I should get, one page yet with so many varieties, can someone please help me? 

Well, in our little group of 6, we shared the hummus plate and the homemade potato chips, both were very good, especially those chips, very thinly cut and complimented very well by the spicy chipotle ranch sauce.

I had the market fish plate, which was a kind of Hawaiian white fish (Oahu fish?), simply grilled, served on top of some corn polenta, grilled fennel and cherry tomatoes.  The overall vinaigrette over the dish was a bit on the sour side for me, but with the light taste of the fish, it actually balanced it out well. I really enjoyed the dish. Some other dishes on the table included the Pad Thai, fish tacos, black bean burger and the smoked salmon salad. I had to point out the Pad Thai especially, which came in a huge bowl, while it tasted pretty good, I was so convinced its a bowl for two, so if you aren't super hungry, order it to share. 

And of course our side of the able had to have some dessert to complete the meal, we all shared the walnut brownie with ice cream. I usually think it's pretty hard to make a bad brownie if you can read instructions, and this one was just perfect for us. You should see how happy when we left.

**One thing to note, although its Thursday at 2pm with only a few tables, parking was quite limited, some of us had to park at the plaza across the street, I cannot imagine if it was a busy time..."}
{"text":"Nice waitress but back patio had dirty furniture(complete with dust and bird poop) Totally hot!! Block fence holds in heat of the day.No fans or misters going to keep people cool!! Tables and chairs not arranged to mingle at all! I've tried several times to enjoy but now decided no more VIG and not to return...Many other places are simply better in the area..."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple of times and it was packed on both occasions.  This is usually a good sign of things to come.  We had a nice table outside by one of their gas fireplace.  Yes it was actually chilly in Phoenix!  The place was kind of loud but it's expected with the hip crowd.  There were a lot of business professionals there letting loose after a hard days work.  I was craving a burger last time and they delivered.  The menu was extensive with quite a bit of variety in cuisine.  Unfortunately this place is a bit out of the way for me so I can't go there as often as I would desire."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Vig after hearing good things and conveniently having a credit from local dines ($15 for $30) and figured it was a good excuse to try it. I think I made the mistake of telling the waitress that I had the certificate from the start because it requires an 18% gratuity to be added automatically and I think this gave her the ok to give some pretty shitty service. Definitely not the place I would recommend if you are in a rush to get somewhere (which we were, unfortunately). It took almost 2 hours to receive our meal and pay for the tab, we could never find her or wave her down to ask for refills or the check and she acted uninterested to be helping us in the first place. If the tip is already included I still expect to get the same amount of service as if you have to work for it. I also don't understand companies that put out coupons or deals and then the employees practically eye roll you when you use them. Very irritating. 

Now, if I block out the service issue and think just about the food then this place definitely would deserve more stars. Food was delicious, good portion and decent prices. I had the turkey sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, both of which were very tasty although I wasn't very fond of the dipping sauce with the fries. Tasted like cumin? Not sure, wasn't my thang though."}
{"text":"Really yummy chips, salsa and guacamole!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great drinks, amazing bartenders. Paul is really personable and creates what ever your in the mood for!"}
{"text":"I go to the vig often because their burgers are pretty good and it's walking distance from my home. But last night my starving boyfriend and I went there and were turned away at the door because we weren't 21. The guy said that the vig is 21 and up after 9 pm on weekends even if you're only getting food? So that's a new rule or something because we always eat there late on the weekends. I won't be going back. Thought this was a restaurant, not a club. Boo, vig."}
{"text":"good setting ... OK drink ... OK service ... even though I had signed for %25 tip, was charged 6xdrink price for tip"}
{"text":"I've been to The Vig many times on Bethany and 16th street and have had wonderful experiences. I went to The Vig last night at 10pm and was very disappointed. The food was delicious but the staff was so awful. When I first arrived I felt that the waitress was unwelcoming and very short. She took forever to just bring water. As I waited for my drink to arrive I noticed she was short with everyone. Then I realized she was the only waitress working with two busboys. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea  to have only one waitress working on a Friday night when it was packed. The waitress was clearly stressed and was unable to conduct herself in a professional manner. I noticed before the when the table next to me could even thank the waitress for the check she turned her back and walked away. I also saw another party walk up to the bar to grab menus and order drinks. We were not given silverware and we're not asked how the meal was. Don't come to this restaurant, especially during the weekend."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner and I enjoyed it. We sat outside on the beautiful patio which was really fun. The food was real good. The service could have been better but it was a Friday night and I think they were short staffed. But ill definately come here again."}
{"text":"Came with a few friends to grab a drink and snack a little bit on a Friday night. There was plenty of seating and the patio is great. I love the Trivial Pursuit cards on the tables but had to trade out our deck because we had a genius edition history deck that nobody could answer. All of the food I tried was good and the prices were reasonable. I won't hesitate to come back here and stay for awhile again."}
{"text":"From: vesperbistro.com

There is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar about a mile from us, called The Vig .  The self proclaimed Modern Tavern has a nice mid century modern feel on the inside and a terrific patio, replete with an outdoor bar, fireplace, and bocce court. 

Today was the day of the local annual marathon here in Phoenix.  For residents that means one thing - forget about trying to go anywhere by car.  So Jen, Ethan and I hopped on our bikes and met up with some friends for lunch at The Vig. 

Arguably one of the best items offered here, isn't on the menu: their pork pozole soup, aka pozole rojo.  I guess after frequenting there enough you start to learn about the hidden menu - kind of like \"animal style\" at In-N-Out I suppose.  The red chiles used in cooking it impart an intense brick red coloring.

Well I'm in a pozole rut right now.  Every time we head there I just have to order a cup or bowl.  With the required warm flour tortilla the bowl is a meal in itself.  The chef at the Vig really nailed this dish.  It is a perfect blend of chiles, slow roasted pork, hominy, oregano, garlic and cilantro.  It has the right amount of kick to.  It is so good, that it is one of those dishes that I am just too afraid to try and make at home - because you know it just won't be the same.  So for now when I am in the mood for pozole I'll hop on my bike and ride over to The Vig."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Thanksgiving turkey twist on a sandwich? Mind blowing."}
{"text":"Fab-you-lusss.

Came here with a 2 sorority sisters and one of their husbands. Poor guy, had to listen to 3 chatty Kathys talking about the old of days of sorority life.

Anyway, ordered a delightful glass of Resiling and the Deconstructed Fish Tacos. Very yummy. The cole slaw was nice and crunchy. My only complaint was that the tortilla shells they gave to make the taco were insanely tiny. I could barely get any ingredients inside. Loved all the extras like the black beans, sour cream, gaucmole they provided but I wanted to eat it all, silly wraps wouldn't let me. So instead I just nibbled on everything and it turned into a deconstructed fish salad. Oh well. It was delish still.

I am so in love with the interior of this place. Literally looks like an old retro 70s motel with the atrium style seating outside and the bocce ball court. Loved it. I will def go back to this place. I hear the happy hour is to die for."}
{"text":"Viggin it every monday for $5 burgers and sundays for 1/2 off bottles of wine!  Great place to go for food and be seen!"}
{"text":"I met some friends here last night for some drinks and to listen to the live band.  All around a really fun experience and I definitely look forward to coming back!

My general first impressions:

- Awesome outdoor patio and live music
- Good Sunday HH (1/2 price bottles of wine)
- Food was ok
- Kind of a \"cool hipster\" crowd

So first off we had a couple of bottles of decent wine.  I loved the patio and the band playing.  I had the shrimp salad, which was ok, but it was actually drenched in dressing (forgot to ask for it on the side).  I probably wouldn't order a salad again because I saw a couple of burgers go by and those looked pretty yummy - or I'll forgo the food for liquid nourishment.  ;) My friends all seemed to enjoy their meals, I think.  Fun, cool vibe about the place.  The server was generally attentive.  

The only negative that I found was that our server added an extra meal into our tab...when we brought it to her attention, rather than correcting the bill and bringing us the correct one (we had already given her cash and our two cards) and bringing everything back to us she just said that she would take the meal off.  It kind of screwed up our mojo when figuring out the bill...it all ended up being ok, but I think in the end, she screwed herself out of some of her tip. 

Definitely will look forward to going back there sometime!"}
{"text":"I like this place more for the drinks and atmosphere than the food, though i know they have gone through lots of effort to improve the menu.  I am undoubtedly a fan and stop in whenever i'm in town!"}
{"text":"\"Vigan\" burger - the reason I go back =)  
Also, great lighting and lovely crowd.  I always bring out-of-towners here, and they're also pleased."}
{"text":"Oh Vig, how I love you. Let me count the ways:

1. Bocce. I mean come on. More bar/restaurants need to have some sort of interactive feature that you can play with your friends. Despite this place always being packed, I've never had to wait that long to play. AND if I wear my red suede heels, my shoes match the red team perfectly! Aaah the small pleasantries of being female!

2. The food. I can't recall trying anything that I haven't liked. My favorite being the Hot Chick. I am a chicken sandwich fanatic and this is the best one that I have found. Ever. Slightly spicy with a generous helping of avocado. Dreamy. Oh and the curry aoli they serve with their sweet potato fries is to DIE for. Can I eat it on everything? Because I'd like to eat it on everything. 

3. The drinks. I can't really say they're AMAZING, because I always have beer. I can get some of my fav standard beers, plus a few interesting cocktails if I feel like branching out. Good in my book! 

4. The atmosphere/decor. Cute and attracts the beautiful crowd without feeling pretentious. The patio is lovely and they are always playing awesome music.

5. The staff. Friendly. Quick. Flawless. A+

6. I can walk there from my house. Seals the deal. 

In fact I love it so much that I'm going in about...oooh 30 minutes, for happy hour :]"}
{"text":"I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer. 

Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.

Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. 
Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. 
Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. 

If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk."}
{"text":"The sandwiches on a pretzel roll were delicious!!!  The cocktails were refreshing on the warm Phoenix day.

Plus, they were showing a soccer match, can't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Love the late night deals and specials. Outside patio is awesome and who doesn't love a house cat?  Service has always been excellent.  Had Hawaiian flatbread which was fair at best. Food could pick it up a bit."}
{"text":"I think 4 stars is pretty close. The wine list was good, but I though there could have been more choices with the beautiful wine cabinet they have in front. We chose the Layer Cake Shiraz and I felt like it fell flat after the tasting. No worries though. The Trifecta was amazing and so were the wings. Best of all, there was no waiting (we had stopped at Postinos and they had an hour wait on a Monday... WTF?) 

Overall we had a great time and it was chill and relaxed. Just what we were looking for on a Monday night after working all weekend. I will definitely be back. =)"}
{"text":"ok i gotta start saying that the vig is one of my fav places to go n have a great time,the place has great specials on wine,beer and food, i usually go to arcadia on thursdays, they have a great dj and i go to uptown on fridays when they have the same dj also ;)

the decor and staff are awesome as well .....if you are looking for a place where you can talk,eat,drink and listen great music in a mature atmosphere the vig is your place."}
{"text":"The food, and scenery were good... The service was not, and that is what makes or breaks a restaurant for me. I might come back for brunch...haven't decided yet."}
{"text":"The Vig has become a reliable fixture in Arcadia. Friendly, competent servers make sure your needs are met. Food is pretty good if nothing special. The highlight: the hamburgers, which the Vig does really well, and the welcoming bar. Appetizers and salads are at par. Maybe not a place worth driving across town for, but great to have in the neighborhood. We've been here several times and will keep comIng back, mostly for the congenial service."}
{"text":"Extremely good wine list, trendy, the place to see and be seen. I didn't have a chance to eat the food but everyone at the bar around me was raving about the quality. I'll have to try it out on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour on Friday a bit ago. The Vig looks unassuming from the outside (in fact, it is easy to miss from the street), but the inside is cozy and modern. I was with a large group and we enjoyed a patio table and the bocce courts. My friends and I mainly had wine and beer, but the menus for both had a nice selection. 

The big drawback for me, though, was the service. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed and was rarely sited. We wanted to order food but we were never quite able to track her down again. While the food is supposed to be good here, we were never able to find out.

Still, the outdoor patio is charming and the bocce court is a nice touch. Will most likely come back, but I do wish they could better coordinate service."}
{"text":"Only been once, but don't really care to return. The server wasn't all that friendly or helpful. The place wasn't busy. I wanted to like it since I really like the Vig Uptown, but it just wasn't for me. It would take a special a occasion or a nudging by friends for me to return to the Vig Arcadia. I couldn't tell you what I had, all I remember is I wanted to finish up and leave."}
{"text":"Awesome suite and tie drink and let's talk about the nachos so great.. Good service also super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Got invited out last night by a friend for happy hour. But I'm a workaholic and didn't get to make it out to this place till almost 8 pm.

First things first. Parking is a pain. Make sure you have cash for valet + tip, or be in the know as to where you can park before walking over. 

It's a pretty hip joint. I'd say the highlight of the place is the outdoor courtyard- it's bigger than the restaurant itself, and on the beautiful spring nights like these just absolutely gorgeous. Apparently they have a resident cat too, which I find adorable. Though one of my table mates was allergic, so the poor guy probably appreciated that a bit less. 

My dish was okay. I didn't really get to sample any of everybody else's appetizers seeing as how we got there so late. I did enjoy the cheesy tots, and that jalapeno aioli is pretty amazing. I got the reuben sandwich and it was... okay I guess. Nothing to write home about. The shoestring fries were nice. My drink was stronger than I would have liked. I got reaaaally tipsy, but it wasn't a taste explosion or anything.

So really... this place was okay. Nice ambience, but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"While I enjoy the food and atmosphere, the service needs improvement.  My biggest complaint lately has to be the rude hostess.  We had business clients in town this week and wanted to seat a party of seven for lunch.  Since they don't take reservations, I called about 15 minutes ahead to give them a heads-up we were on our way.  I did not realize that a coworker also called 15 minutes prior for the same reason.  When we arrived, the hostess seemed really put-out that we had called her TWICE and generally had such a rude demeanor that even our out-of-town clients commented on it.  Then she proceeded to seat us at a table that was too small to accomodate 7 people.  We actually had to squeeze 2 people at the head of the table, which was very uncomfortable.  Seeing as how the restaurant was half empty, I think she could have been more accomodating.  The host/hostess is the \"first impression\" for any restaurant, and this woman was definitely a sour note.  Perhaps the Vig should make her a dishwasher instead?"}
{"text":"First time dining at The Vig. We went for brunch and I will definitely be back! The black bean burger is absolutely wonderful. I also had the sweet potato fries which were amazing. Extremely happy!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the VIG and have never had anything not good there.  I can't eat cheese and decided to try the flatbread special without cheese one day and it was fantastic.  They will also do substitutions and I get the deconstructed fish taco with chicken instead.  My 75 year old parents also love the food but feel a little out of place with the young crowd.  More parking would be nice instead of valet."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. We've been going to The Vig for a year or more and we've tried about everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Open late, not too expensive, good service and good drinks! Great place to be anytime of day!"}
{"text":"Yes parking sucks but totally worth it for the great food, drinks and ambiance. Sunday afternoons are especially great at The Vig with live music and 1/2 price bottles of wine."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out and get a bite to eat. Good food, atmosphere, ect. An all around plus for me!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with 2 friends for lunch on a weekend. 

Cons:
1. Only valet parking $3. No free parking for such a tiny place.

2. HORRIBLE customer services. This is the worst customer services I have ever received from an american restaurant. Waitresses were non friendly, never smiled once except when giving us our check, brought us only 2 water when we had 3 ppl, never asked how I wanted my steak or eggs, demanded to take my meny back even when she saw me still lookin at it. Attitude was horrible overall. You can tell she doesnt want to serve us. Front check in girl gave the same vibe. Only time she smiled was when we left, and it was a forced smile.

3. Food was okay. Somewhat overpriced for the amount given. Steak was half the size of what you would normally expect. And NO steak sauce even though they served steak. Really?

Pros:
1. Nice ambient atmosphere.
2. The mexican cleaning ladies. They were probably the only friendly workers in this place. 

Never coming back here again. Management need to re-train their employees in the art of customer services because it SUCKS."}
{"text":"I'm glad to live so close to The Vig! I love drinking on their outdoor patio (when it's not blazing hot). What really makes this place great is they have a cat. It has to be the most laid back cat of all time to deal with all the noise and drunk girls (like me) who want to love on it."}
{"text":"it's like a grown up Casey Moores! So cute and I was soo loving the saxaphone player with the DJ. The food was good too, I would be interested in trying more of the food here because I hear good things about the chefs. 
I think I really like this place, but fear it may be a little too yuppie-ish, but we'll see!"}
{"text":"I am a little torn on this one. The food was pretty good, and there were lots of options... The service was just SO BAD. Having been a server, I Expect better than what we got here. The waitress seemed irritated to have to bother with us, and everything was slow to come out. But again, when it did come out it was great! Patio is gorgeous, the people are just pretty pretentious."}
{"text":"Super cute patio, excellent music, a dj with a trumpet. Just a fun vig. The food was great too :) Will definitely be back. Good for a small outing, or a big party."}
{"text":"Really nice spot to hang out with friends and have a casual night out.  Good food, good drinks, and nice decor."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in the Arcadia area! Friendly staff, amazing food, and live music. Highly recommend the grilled fish tacos."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at The Vig this afternoon and since I was with the local Arizona Yelp gal Gabi I thought I would start yelping again. 

This was my second visit to the Vig and I have gotten the same thing both tines. Hummus, edamae and artichoke dip and all three are just great. 

The spices on the edamae makes them so much better than just regular salt, the hummus is creamy and the artichoke dip is so good plus no onions!  

Great bar, cool outdoor dining and a must stop for me when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some good ideas, though over-priced and over-hyped.  On the two occasions I've been the food has been nearly satisfactory, if somewhat dry, though definitely over-priced for what was delivered.  The Vig Cobb salad was good, the \"Hot Vings\" are what you would expect for bar food, but the tenderloin was anything but tender, trending a bit more on the dry, slightly overcooked side.

Overall service left quite a bit to be desired.  

The atmosphere can best be summed up by a comment overheard during our first visit in which a woman at a nearby table proclaims, \"what I love about this place is that its just like Scottsdale...only its in Phoenix.\"  

The bocce is a good idea and the patio is nice.  But over all The Vig comes up short.  Attempting to make up for lacking substance with style that just doesn't cover it either."}
{"text":"Went here with my son before our flight and we had a Sunday afternoon to enjoy.

What a great place.  Good food.  Good vibe.  Friendly, attractive staff.  Great local band - outside.  Fireplace - playoff football on the TV.  What a great place to hang for a few hours."}
{"text":"Mmm...came to The Vig last year when visiting a friend in Phoenix and had a fantastic lunch experience. Came again a few nights ago to experience the late night menu. We were in around 12:30am, and were promptly greeted with fantastic and quick service even though the place was pretty packed. We ordered the nachos with no meat and extra guac. They were EPIC. Some of the best nachos we've ever had. Full of toppings, crispy, warm, delicious, plentiful. Wow. Our friends ordered the artichoke dip (yum) and the edamame (good but damn pricy for an item that is usually less than $2 at most establishments). My SO ordered a margarita and it was alright - a little watery and the most prominent flavor was the margarita mix instead of tequila. Overall a fantastic joint with a great vibe - will definitely be returning. Looking forward to a round of bocce ball next time."}
{"text":"The Vig is a beautiful bar with good food (as far as bar food goes).  I don't get caught up in the Scottsdale plastics or snobby labels that people love to stamp on others.  It has a great ambience no matter what part of town it is in.  The patio is breathtaking and yes I will return."}
{"text":"Pros: 
#1. Great place to drink anytime of the week or weekend. Sundays can be a little hectic, but if you are into that sort of thing, this place is perfect. 
#2. Fairly decent food. Nothing mind blowing, but it is always consistent. 
#3. Live entertainment (DJs and Bands throughout the week). 
#4. Great atmosphere. Nice outside fire place and Italian lawn bowling. 

Cons 
#1. Parking is a pain. Don't drink too much or crossing the street over the checks cashed parking lot can be dangerous. 
#2. Drinks are usually weak and somewhat over priced. 
#3. The Arcadia crowd can be a little much. You know old guys with young girls or cougars with young men. Once again, if that is your thing you will love this place. 

Overall The Vig is a pretty decent spot and I recommend everyone I know to try it at least once."}
{"text":"I go to Phoenix every couple of weeks for work and this is number 1 spot I hang out with my friends after work. Great environment and food with really cool crowd. On certain days there is even live music going on. Haven't see her last time I was there but I believe her name is Britney - really cool and fun server.  Burgers are to die for at Vig!"}
{"text":"They changed their menu again! Removed a bunch of good items and got rid of lunch specials while at it. Replaced the good items with mediocre ones at best. I won't go back, Ingo's is down the street, better deal, better food!"}
{"text":"First time visit and we loved it! Hubby and I went for Happy Hour with with some of my co workers. We had  tacos, wings, Flatbread, hummus and chicken blt. All of the food was really good. 

The hostess was sweet and our server was on top of her game,  too bad i cant remember her name. I know shes Asian mixed blonde hair with tats, we had a mini convo about Asian moms... She checked on us once in awhile checking for drinks and if we wanted more food. I like that she didnt bother us too much and even reminded us that  the happy hour was about to end in case we needed to order more food from the hh menu.

 Also, its great that they have valet, and the valet guys were all smiles even though it had been raining that day. Oh and my hubby rides a motorcycle and they let him park close to the door since there was enough space. We were very impressed with this restaurant and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great decor, the food is over rated and over priced for the quality and quantity you get. Terrible parking keeps me away it's ridiculous for a restaurant this size and during their hours."}
{"text":"The best part about the Vig is the patio.  In nice weather, sitting outside with the lights, heaters as necessary and a fire-pit, makes for a great ambiance that can only be found so frequently in Phoenix. 

They offer a nice wine menu and fresh cocktails, making the Vig a great spot for drinks only as well as a good dinner.  Last time I was there I tried the Pad Thai, which was surprisingly good for not being an Asian restaurant.  The french fries that came with my boyfriend's sliders were half regular, and half sweet potato, and they were amazing. Our table of 4 split two bottles of wine and the garlic edamame (yumm) appetizer and everybody was quite satisfied.  

The atmosphere is very social, and someone from our party ran in to someone she knew and was able to catch up pretty easily. Service is good, with knowledgeable servers who are attentive enough to be helpful without overbearing.

One thing to note is that parking in their lot is usually mandatory valet, but if they're slow enough that's not always enforced.  There's no great alternative for parking in the neighborhood, so I recommend factoring that cost in to your visit.  

All in all, The Vig is fun for a night out or date night! It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Tried new items on the menu since I come often. I was extremely impressed with the new dishes that were chosen. We had three new items and one of the desserts, all were amazing. The service was great. Both bartenders were friendly and prompt. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Just average. 

PROS:
1. Fun and laid back vibe on the patio

CONS:
1. Average food. Bland flatbread. Overcooked mahi for the deconstructed fish tacos, but it did taste good otherwise. 
2. Warm white wine
3. Parking - $3 valet. That is fine but I wish I knew that when I arrived since I don't carry cash."}
{"text":"Update 11/11/10. Hostess was stuffy and couldn't imagine someone would go there by themselves. So she sat everyone before me then asked me when the rest of my party was coming. No tables left, I sat at the bar not exactly in a great mood. Don't sit at the bar if you want anyone to pay attention to you. When they do, they won't be able to hear you, so they'll throw their arms up in the arm and not bring you what you ordered, until the next bartender comes along and says their co-worker \"forgot\". Service here must be consistently horrible. I keep giving it another shot and always leave disappointed and in a worse mood than when I came.

True to form, the food was decent.  Not great, not good, but decent. But decent food + horrible service + attitude + getting elbowed in the head by the drunk guy standing next to you = no buenas dias for me."}
{"text":"They take care of me at The Vig.  My local hot spot where I take my clients sometimes after their massage with me.  The food is always fresh, the servers are continually delightful and my clients leave with a full belly and happy.

Happy Hour is grand!  From 3 to 6 pm you can get 12 plump, juicy chicken wings with blue cheese and celery sticks for only $4.50.  I adore the wines, and they are only $6.  

The Vig Azz burger is yummy.  YES, I like meat :-)  Veggies too, yet, the burger is cooked to order, fresh condiments, huge onion rings and the buns are soft ~

I am hungry for it right now ~"}
{"text":"I rarely have something here that I don't like. Their burger is hands down the best I've ever had. They also have a killer steak salad, not to mention their amazing patio. One of the best outdoor seating areas ever!"}
{"text":"The Vig is Arcadia's Neighborhood Bar!

Swanky Vibe W/ Fantastic Music
Consistantly Good Food
Great Friendly Service 
& A Price Tag That Won't Bankrupt you!

\"Oh Yeah\"
- Awsome Monday Night Burger Special
Their Burger is as good if not better than some of these over priced Burger Joints!
The only draw back  it does get very crowded...

Still The Vig is one of my favorite places to go for a fun night out...

They did an excellent job remodeling this cinder block run down building to its 1960's splender... The mature landscaping with trees that hang down over the outside tables and the dim lighting candlelight ambiance set the mood. 


Weather your out with a few friends or on a hot date this Resturant/ Bar will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Very trendy spot in Arcadia. Had always heard about this place and finally decided to go since I was in the area. The patio is awesome I love all the trees! Great happy hour too if you get there before 6!"}
{"text":"Kinda torn between a 4 and a 5 here.  Been here three times now and it's hard to have any complaints about the Vig.  I love the service, I love the ambience, and I am never disappointed with the food.  Here's the breakdown:
- Seasonal Veggie Plate: 4.5 Stars, so good!!
- Tandoori Flatbread: 5 Stars, loved it
- Chips, Salsa & Guac: 3 Stars, not bad, nothing special
- Hummus Plate: 4 Stars, very good hummus
- Vigan Sandwich: 3 Stars, fine but probably wouldn't order it again

The Vig has slowly worked its way into my list of default places to go, especially late night.  It doesn't hurt that they have lots of vegan and veg options!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day with a few friends for lunch. I have never been to this location before only the one on 16th street.
Same type of deal here. To park in their lot you must Valet. Which is free at lunch, but costs @ Dinner.
Any way 3 of us were lined up,they must of been a little over whelmed 11:30am. We had our cars parked and proceeded inside.
Nice restaurant, very cozy inside despite the Concrete walls. I see it as very 60's modern and I love it!. We were seated where inside meets outside, the patio is wonderful. It is my favorite part of the setting.

Food was very good,awesome actually.  The entire party really enjoyed what they got. Our server was nice, but he was on a very slow mode. I know we waited over 30 min for our food to come out. There was 4 of us and it was lunch time. But, I really think they need more servers. Because, they really seemed over whelmed. Luckily we had a lot of time for a long leisurely lunch.
But, had we of been on a schedule it would not of been cool.

Bathrooms are clean ,nicely designed ,but very dark. Yes I looked good in the mirror, but reality was it was sunny outside, and I was not going to look so good out there!
 Oh well! Heehee
I  will diffidently come back. I like the atmosphere and the Food is good.
Though you spend a little more than you would may have planned because, then you have to tip the valet a few $$. So be prepared for that.
I was lucky I had some cash with me. More and more I never carry cash."}
{"text":"The food is amazing at The Vig & that half price wine on Sundays can't be beat! They could work on the acoustics. It's real loud both inside and out, with and without the live band. Not only do we have to yell at each other to be heard/understood, but the servers are also yelling at each other."}
{"text":"We tried to schedule our sons baptism reception here... it has been like pulling teeth... through emails... phone messages... neither of which have been returned. I'm not sure of it's because we said our reception needed to be at 11:15 or 11:30 and not 11...  at least respond, Cesar... or return a phone call... super unprofessional!!! Lame! 

On a happy note... we found somewhere in the Arcadia neighborhood that was more than willing to take our hundreds of dollars..."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good. But I give this place 2 stars only because they added an extra $10 tip to my bill. When I saw my bank account the next day. Which had gratuity on it already.  Make sure to keep your guest copy and don't get the blonde girl with long hair."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food. The food is good, but the atmosphere is better."}
{"text":"Love the vig, I just wish a few less people did too!  It can be tough to get a seat after work but it always seems to work out.  

Parking is a pain.  You can either go to the free valet (just tip them when you leave) or park across the street.  If you have an extra couple buck I'd suggest the valet.  Quick, easy and frankly it makes me feel \"special\".

Happy hour is stellar and everything I've had there is great.  Burgers, wings, salmon.

Great beer selection and even better patio.  If you read my reviews you will quickly notice a theme of 4 things...  1. Love bars 2. Love patios 3. Love food 4. Love my wife

This place satisfies all.  They have bocci ball to boot.

Grab a cocktail, put on some shades and loung in one of their comfy chairs.

Oh - staff is always on point from the bartenders to the bus boys.

Oh - (another one, sorry) I heard the owner opend a bar called Little Woodys down the street.  Haven't been but if its the same guy I'm sure its a nice spot."}
{"text":"The patio is amazing.  Staff is friendly and the demographic is young professionals.  Great place for happy hour, networking, meeting new people."}
{"text":"The Vig gets 4 stars for being a convenient neighborhood bar and grill.  Food is acceptable but nothing exceptional.  The menu has not changed in 6 months so I don't need one anymore.  Good bar and service although it can get crowded and noisy on a busy night.  Did I mention that I hate loud, crowded bars so this review is slanted to off their nights.  Staff is generally very pleasant."}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the deal: I really love their half priced bottles of wine on Sundays and because I am Italian, the bocci court is a nice touch...but that's kind of it.  I think the food used to be way better and the service is, more times than not, lackluster. Maybe it's the atmosphere...I'm not a fan of the whole Scottsdale scene and this place reeks of Bro.  I just think in a town where there are so many new restaurants popping up, you gotta step up your game.  Get some more vegetarian options or revamp the menu with something a little more fresh.  I won't refuse to return, but it is definitely not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"The place is great for some drinks after work.  It has a great bar.  I love to sit at bars.  The back outdoor patio has a great atmosphere with glassed in fireplaces and lots of seating.  If you want to play some games they have bocce ball.  I went with my husband and we were sitting at a table and just kind of looking at each other like \"ok so what do we talk about now\".  Low and behold there were some trivia pursuit cards on the table.  We made up our own rules \"Ok if you ask a question I can't answer I get to ask you for another question one time\".  We had so much fun.  I think it's a wonderful place to frequent.  The food is wonderful and it's a great place to meet your friends."}
{"text":"The Vig is a great place to go if you want delicious food, a casual atmosphere, and the potential to meet a lot of new people. It's a restaurant bar, but the layout makes it very easy to approach new people and make new friends. They have bocce ball in the back patio, which is always a good time (especially after a few drinks). They don't usually have drink specials, but sometimes they do $5 pretzle bun burger Mondays, and that is the best thing ever! It has a really cool atmosphere with plenty of booths, trivial pursuit cards on the tables, and an expansive rear outside dining area with cozy fireplace seating."}
{"text":"Food was so bad we didn't want to eat it. $40. for lunch (2 sandwiches and ice teas) and threw most of it away. Waiter didn't care. Will never go back, I feel so ripped off."}
{"text":"Newest person MARK....rocked it. Don't know where he's from, but he's super friendly and professional. YAY!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great crowd, great food, and the best part- 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday! The Uptown location is probably my favorite, but possibly just because it's closer to home (16th St and Bethany Home). Wait staff is attentive and friendly. Outdoor patio is great when weather permits, and if you can't get an outside table, the doors open almost all the way up, so get a table on the border and you can still enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Came here one night with one of my girlfriends a while back--it was half price, bottles of wine (say what?!) so we had a bit of vino and had some serious fun! The food was BOMB! I had a burger and remember it tasting great!"}
{"text":"Great food! We stopped in for lunch and had the tater tot appetizer that is deep fried tots with cheese and a jalapeño dipping sauce. I had The Vig Dip which was a French dip on a pretzel bun, very delicious! I would suggest the French fries as your side. My co-worker had The Hot Chick which was a chicken sandwich and she loved it as well. They also had free valet!

Had to update because the service is getting worse. We constantly have to ask out server over and over again for items...that is if we can't find her. This has happened on multiple occasions. Not sure if they are just under staffed."}
{"text":"I've actually been here twice now. First time, I was with friends after a tasting at Sportsman's. The only thing I remember is that I wasn't very taken with the atmosphere, and not too impressed with the food.
But, I keep hearing friends with positive comment, so I thought I'd try again. This time, I stopped to grab a quick dinner before a late business meeting nearby. No parking spaces on the lot, so I used the valet since I was in a hurry - and he parked it on the front lot in an unmarked space. WTF? I could have done that myself for free!
I was there with menu in hand by 10 of 6. Happy hour ends at 6, and the woman bartender, who was not very friendly, took her good ole time getting orders for two other couples that came in after me, so I wound up with no wine discount. She shrugged.
Younger guy bartender was happy to answer questions about the food. Achiote salmon was much better than I expected, even though the slab of fish was obviously of the perfectly-formed, vacuum-packed, frozen variety, not even close to fresh. The somewhat sweet corn cake, set off with spicy chorizo in the center was the highlight of the meal. 
On a Tues. night, a few cougars, but mostly regular gals at the tables eating dinner...and a lot of Creepy Old Guys (COGs). Too many other great places in the area to return to one that is just so-so."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at The Vig. It is a great place to hang with friends. It has solid food, good prices, and one of the best patios in town. I love that you can go there for a night out on the town or show up in flip flops to just hang out. 

If you haven't been you should go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Vig on 16th st, so I decided I would try this location.  First off I got here around 5PM on a Friday night so needless to say it was VERY busy!  
We just decided to hang out on the back patio and have a few drinks, even the back patio was PACKED!  Great priced wine and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is a really fun place. The food is excellent! They have a pretty extensive drink list. The deserts were delicious! My only complaint: it's a bit noisy inside (all of that stone on the walls and ceiling makes it echo!). But otherwise, it's a great place, with great energy and a lot of fun! 
p.s. Parking is a drag -- there isn't enough of it nearby."}
{"text":"Eat at the bar or the patio. Great place for brunch/lunch, the spicy bloody mary's and mac n cheese with broccoli or the shrimp and chicken pad thai are a delicious morning-after snacks."}
{"text":"The Vig is a trendy go-to spot. I've been here a couple of times, and it's always a safe choice because the menu isn't anything crazy and the food is good. I debated between and 3 and a 4, and I ultimately went with a 3 because the food has never been above good.

This last time I got the fish tacos (4 to an order on double corn tortillas), and they were good but not anything amazing. I didn't care for the spicy slaw and rather it had just cabbage personally. Our waitress was super friendly too. She checked in on us a couple of times. I came here with a friend I hadn't seen in years, and the waitress was patient with us and our orders as we took a few long minutes to catch up first. 

The atmosphere of the place is fun. It has a fairly decent patio section and apparently it includes a smoking section. There is cornhole, which is plus. Overall, a safe spot to go for some good food but I wouldn't say you'll be surprised."}
{"text":"I like to come here for lunch dinner and every now and then i will go over there for.late nite fun!!!!

{"text":"Looking for a healthy gluten free restaurant that both of us would like can be difficult when we travel so much. 
First time 2/20/2017 for lunch. My husband and I were impressed. The staff were friendly & helpful. The salad with grilled chicken and amazing vinegar dressing was amazing!  The Brusselsprouts were delicious. Even my husband was impressed with his sausage gravy & biscuits. The setting was comforting, welcoming and inviting. 
We both recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"4 stars for environment, 3 stars for food and drink, 2 stars for the people there.

The place is really nice, love the decor and the outdoor seating. Tons of seating, just a really nice ambiance. They had a band playing good music and I could see this being quite a good first date/romantic evening place.

However, I was just in town on business and on this particular Saturday night, I could just feel the schmoozy dude/ fake valley chick vibe. I guess if you're in to that vibe it might be cool, but it seemed like everyone was there to just be a scenester  and show off. I'm in for \"a night out on the town\", but maybe this felt a little too LA to me. Sorry LA.

The food was good, had the ribeye steak which was cooked properly with a great sauce on top, but the quality of meat was only so so. It also had cauliflower and potatoes on the side, both of which were good. There was a good selection of booze, and they carry Stella which is always my go-to beer to go with a steak. The price is quite reasonable, beer and a steak for $25 is okay in my books (or maybe I'm just used to Bay Area, CA prices?)"}
{"text":"My friends and I were treated terribly when we went to just have a good time. Some woman apparently had a table that was VIP we had no idea that the whole table was taken. So I nicely said that's fine go get up. And she said to me \" Your going to get your sassy white ass up now!\" I was very taken back and very offended and probably is said a few words I shouldn't have. Later on I was cornered by a manager or so she said in the bathroom. Which I found odd, so I ask or I tried to ask the lady that had the problem why would she not come to me first and asking whatever she needed to ask me instead of sending an Entourage. Long story short this woman have had it out for me and my friend the whole time as soon as we got there and management did not help at all. It was a terrible experience they never gave us a chance to talk before they physically put my friend in a Full Nelson and manhandled her like a rag doll all for trying to ask somebody a question. Out of control. I really like this place I thought it was cool I would never ever go there again not after this"}
{"text":"It's beyond me as to why people fawn over this place.  It is completely unremarkable with all the charm of an Appleby's.  The food is passable, nothing more."}
{"text":"This place is Bangin!

The food and drink were perfect for our late night adventure while we were on vacation. 

The patio fireplace to get cozy on a cool evening. 

Will definitely be returning on my next trip to PHX."}
{"text":"Love the VIg! Great food and atmosphere! Its a great mixed crowd and I love the live bands on Sundays! Awesome patio!"}
{"text":"Big ups to the Vig.  Sometimes you stumble on a restaurant so good you wish it was in your own neighborhood.  I want to give this restaurant a warm deep kiss--it excels at everything.  The decor: Mid Century Modern.  Cool and inviting.  The waitstaff: attentive in every manner.  We ordered the chickpea and pita bread for the table and our waitress refilled the plate three times!  The food: the absolute bomb in comfort food.  I could live on the spicy chicken wings: the best I have tasted.  The Cobb salad is perfectly balanced.  The Pad Thai: a complex flavor bomb of Asian tastes."}
{"text":"The estimated wait time was off (about 15 min off) but we had a semi large group (8 people) so can't blame them too much for that. Table setup for a group over 4 to 6 would be difficult on the inside. Service was spotty, seemed like they could use 2 more waiters. Food was fantastic though! Very good portion and great quality. Would come back with a smaller group and at a less busy time and I bet it would be great."}
{"text":"Good late night food. I went with several friends, and they were not impressed with the waitress we had, but I suspect she was just a bit tired. Try the macaroni and cheese, it was heavenly!"}
{"text":"Decided to venture beyond my normal territory within my own city with spouse.  It is a long way from Chandler, ha ha (20 minutes).

I really like this place and its atmosphere.  Didn't feel like I was in a typical Phoenix establishment.  I always tell people Phoenix is loaded with chains and this place proves me wrong.

I had the The Frenchy (good but not great), spouse had the The Good 'Ol Steak Salad (excellent).  I should have had the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken, which I will have the next time I venture to that side of town.  

The food was good and the place itself even better, wish I was closer for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Nachos were excellent. Great mix of people. Not too thrilled with the mandatory valet."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, my experience there yesterday was less then desirable.  I was irritated by the way the hostess handled herself.  She is just a nasty individual with zero customer service and the manager was exactly the same.  My friends and I go often and for these 2 women to be nasty to my group is unacceptable!  

After the rude and obnoxious behavior from these 2 ladies, I am not sure if we will be heading back to the Vig anytime soon.  Also, from other patrons of the Vig yesterday, they also experienced the same behavior from the 2.

My recomendation to the Vig.....Find yourself a new hostess and Manager."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Cozy patio sometimes live music on the patio outside.  Excellent menu with many gluten free options.  Late night dining kitchen open til 1 a.m. Will definitely comeback here and would definitely recommend. They have the best gluten free bun I have ever had. From the outside its not much to look at it and would be easy to drive past but don't"}
{"text":"Oh Vig, you simply sucked!!! 

Such a waste of time and money. The food and service here was awful, all except for the girl at the door the night we were there, which was on February 16th she was pretty nice. She was they only exception though, the guy at the bar was such a flirt, but in a very uncomfortable way. Then after waiting for our party at the bar we decided to move to a table and enjoy our drinks there. Then we come to realize that our server was a real stuck up and rude girl, that was nowhere to be found when needed and that took forever to come back to our table for assistance or further request! I don't think that's acceptable, we had to get other servers attention to get things for our table. Then after all that hassle, we stumble upon the nastiest nachos ever and okay drinks and wine, this was just plain awful and not worthy of your time nor mine!! Never again, never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot i finally got to.check out last night. I was cool because it was a slow night so the service was good and.we got our food very quick. The decor is so cool specially the outside area with a tree and a tv and the lighting is awesome. We had really good wings and some fish tacos that were excellent the drinks were on point also so. Thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Lunch with Libby!  Excellent variety, great service!  Had the deconstructed fish taco salad. Good but fish dry/overdone.  I would go again & try one of the many selections. 
Thanks for a fun time Libby:)"}
{"text":"Yo my AZ peeps if you want great atmosphere and great food hop in the car and get to the VIG! Chicken wings for appetizer, Grapefruit& Vodka drink , grilled chicken roasted red bell peeper with spicy avocado sandwich. Their Prime rib dip amazing... Need I say more ? A great place to host casual company party with outside bar, grill, corn hole game . So cool . The staff super!"}
{"text":"I won't normally give 5 stars, I promise.

The Vig was the ideal way to end our night and final layer of the vodka sweater.

Our bartender, Logan was a delight!  Did we have a sign on our foreheads: serve these gals lots of vodka.  The grape invader or perpetrator was ridiculous.

The barkeep recommended we add tomato and basil to our order of grilled cheese: now that's love.

Vig never disappoints.  Although, where was George last night????"}
{"text":"How horrible this place is!  They committed to doing a fund raiser for Cesar Chavez elementary school, school sent flyers, promoted them.... Then decided to not follow through because they ONLY support Arcadia High School.  Sad that a group of elementary school students had to miss out on their fund raising opportunity."}
{"text":"November 4th... perfect one man band. Music was relaxing and perfect volume. I am so happy :)"}
{"text":"Good quality food and pleasant atmosphere. I wish they had a specific lunch menu. 

A bit overpriced, but portions are good. 

A nice place to try if you're in Arcadia looking for a place with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This four star review is mostly for the staff:

We came here for a goodbye party for one of our co-workers last week, it was raining and we ended up huddled at the bar by the bathrooms because it was so crowded. However, the rain let up a little bit and we decided to take a chance at sitting on the patio. 

The staff could not have been more accomodating, they set up the umbrellas so we wouldn't get wet if it started to sprinkle again, they encircled us with heatlamps, lit the fire and even passed out blankets!

I don't have much to say about the food, both times I've been here I've been too tipsy to really remember if it was good or not. But I highly recommend sitting on the wonderful patio and having a glass of wine."}
{"text":"With a swanky 60s underground vibe, the Vig is one of my fav places to go for a night out. Although they are located on a pretty busy street, they did an excellent job with the design of the outdoor area. The cinder blocks that make up the walls, the trees that hang down over the outside tables and the dim lighting/candlelight totally set the mood. The inside bar, booth and table area can get super noisy, so my suggestion is to sit outside especially if it's nice out. I also looooooooooove that they have bochi ball! 

Their drink, wine & beer lists are solid, and their menu has an interesting flair to it. The double down hummus is yummy, and I also recommend the deconstructed fish taco. I really enjoy their take on bar food. Like the potato gnocchi with sautéed shrimp for example... the orange-chipotle alfredo sauce is something that I would never think of, but it really compliments the potato gnocchi and the veggies that are also tossed into the dish. I was impressed. 

I'm all about places that have character, and The Vig is a great addition to the Arcadia area. It's not one of those places filled with fake people just trying to impress each other. Instead, it's a fun hang out spot where you go to joke around with friends and have a good time, and what's not to like about that?

It can get overly crowded, and the service can be hit or miss. But overall I'm a fan of this place and it's become part of my Arcadia stomping grounds. Plus, they also play awesome music and I can totally get my groove on!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, THE SERVICE and waiter were HORRIBLE.  We waited over 20 mins for our drinks as he cleaned nearby tables that guests vacated (that was more important)

He showed his attitude and was rude.  VIG doesn't care about their customers anymore as they are so busy.  No one from management even walks the floor in the front of the house to asks guests about their experience.  The VIG got too big too quick and forgot about good customer service.  Get rid of the staff with attitude!!!

Wont even try the Vig uptown.  Wont waste my time."}
{"text":"Weird parking setup. Almost always a wait. Inadequate bathrooms. Noisy. Not usually items that show up in a 5/5 review from me. But for some reason I just love The Vig (this one, in particular) and put up with it. Happily!

Their food and drink menu fits everyone's needs. You want a cheap beer and nachos/burger? Done for only $13. You want some nice wine & tasty/unique salad? Not a problem. Loads of wines for under $10/glass (half price bottles all day every Sun) paired with the Prickly Pear Shrimp Salad total for $20. Who's complaining? Or go rogue with entrees like Carne Asada on Potato Pancake or Pad Thai. I've gone to The Vig with the pickiest and the fanciest eaters. All left happy. I just don't think there are too many places I can say the same about. 

Birthdays, Engagement, No-good-reason.... All shared with The Vig. It's truly a top 5 go-to spot for me. Quirks and all. I honestly just love it."}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot- seems like they're more known for their food, but we popped in for some drinks and watched a game at the bar. Their house red wine was a great smooth merlot (and a generous pour) that was a lot better than I was expecting, and my guy appreciated their Four Peaks Kilt Lifter on draft. We weren't particularly hungry but wanted to at least try their food. Unfortunately nothing really jumped out at us on the menu, but apparently dinner is where they shine, according to other reviews. The roasted brussels sprouts are a little boring but it's always good to see a vegetable available instead of just deep-fried junk.  Cute outdoor patio area seems nice for chilling at night!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about the Vig?

Highlights: personable waitstaff, awesome decor, beautiful people, delicious wine.
Lows: I'll get back to you....   ;-)

So far this place has done nothing but exceed my expectations.  I don't know what I loved more- the phenomenal food, the amazingly adorable waiter, or the ridiculously delicious wine.

I cannot wait to come back here to try out the happy hour menu or a weekend afternoon!"}
{"text":"This place has some delicious food for sure.

I can personally only speak for the Vigazz Burger, but dang, that was tasty, especially with the added Fried Egg.  Yum.

Service was excellent.  One of the entrees for our group (The Prime Vig) came out a bit cold, but our waitress was very kind and quick to get it heated up.

The patio is great.  I wish they had it a bit more open, and I don't love that they still allow smoking.  It is very cool that you can get Bocce Balls and play, though.  Fun for families and friends.

Overall, a great choice for lunch.  
ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The Vig has amazing and delicious food!  This is a good spot for dining, or gathering with your friends for a good time out. The Vig staff where extremely professional, our server offered great customer service, and actually made sure we where completely taken care of. The food quality and portion was reasonable for the price. Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Swinging place and great food. I was there recently with a group of 12. The staff very efficiently handled our group. The eclectic music was spot on for the vibe of Vig and you could still carry on a conversation. I had the Five Spice edamame, Vigazz burger and a beer, the burger was fantastic. Other entrees with positive feedback from the group: Carne Asada, Love Me Tenderloin, Salmon, Hot Chick. The Five Spice Edamame was a nice spin on a usually unexciting appetizer. I'll be back soon to enjoy the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Lots of old ass Ed Hardy/Affliction-wearing dudes and leather-tanned cougars here!

Makes for great people watching when I'm here on a Saturday enjoying an awesome $3 margarita and eating some yummy Vig tacos. The live band was great! You do have to get there early (before 2 pm) if you want to get a seat out on the patio. 

You can read the other reviews but the general consensus is that it's a pretty cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. The prices are very reasonable and the food was AMAZING. I had the ribs and fries and my friend ordered the Mac n Cheese and I tried it and it was delicious. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Met up with a girlfriend here to catch up (we were revealing that we were pregnant to each other & didn't even know!!  Our babies are 3 days apart!)
We sat on the patio- very nice & relaxing!  I had my toddler with me and this isn't ideal for a tot, but it accommodated him well with the outdoor feel and appeal.
Ordered the sliders and Mac & Cheese for the it the guy.  Sliders were good and I tried his and it was delish!  I'll be back for a cocktail happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been frequenting for over a year and it never disappoints.

The clientele can be bizarre from time to time but the bartenders are amazing and they have great customer service!

Music is usually epic and the food is unbelievable. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. While the food was good and the service okay what a disappointment to spend $250 (plus tip) for five people, be asked to move tables 45 minutes into our evening so they can host a party in our section, to find out I asked for an extra scoop of ice cream with our dessert and we were charged $4?  Come on VIG. Where is your customer service?  You'd think four bottles of wine and no questions asked when asked to move tables would be worth  $0.25 of ice cream.  Amazing. I won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was fun with live music and good drinks but the wait was a bit outrageous... we ended up leaving for someplace else to eat and then coming back when we got buzzed for a table... the problem was when we got there the table was for an inside booth when we specifically requested an outside table. 

I'd go back but maybe not when it was so crowded..."}
{"text":"I went here for a first date, about 11pm on a Friday night. It was trendy and loungie, really liked it! It wasn't packed on a Friday night and there was lots of options for seating. Indoors or outside on the large patio. The patio had fans outside and christmas lights so it was darker but great for conversation as well. They had music playing on the speakers which wasn't too loud either. The service was good and the drinks were good as well. Not to expensive. I had a glass of blue moon and it was $5. Very casual and hip place to chill."}
{"text":"The Vig has a GREAT patio with outdoor lounge furniture, fireplaces and heat-lamps creating a great ambiance whether for a romantic evening or a chance to chill with some friends.  The inside is small, with little seating, so I don't really recommend it.  The service is impeccable, walking the fine-line of attentiveness without being overly attentive.   The live music at the Vig is very enjoyable and not played too loud, so you can still carry on a decent conversation while enjoying the backdrop of some IMPRESSIVE musicians...Last night I was there, the lead guitarist and singer from the Gin Blossoms were playing :)"}
{"text":"Ok.. $5.00 butgers,I get it.  You've going to pay one way or another.  I'm giving this place 2 stars because the Sweet Potato Fries are spot-on. Crispy outside and sweet inside. But maybe it's just because I'm from the Midwest,  but I expect better happy hour prices on a house red wine. $8.00 for a glass, missed the next call for happy hour price by 5 minutes and was charged  $10.00. Heck, I could stop at Walgreens and by a comparable bottle for  $5, drink it in the parking lot and go in for the burger. And it's not edgy, just grubby"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to hang out, people watch, and throw back a few cocktails.  They've done a remarkable job with the outdoor dining/bar/bocce ball area.  You almost forget that on the other side of the fence is a stripmall/parking lot asphalt wasteland.  The food here is decent and reasonably priced american fare though I haven't had anything that's blown me away."}
{"text":"This is one of my local favorite places to go. Especially on Sunday for brunch and $15 unlimited mimosas. They have live music pretty often, if you want to watch a game its usually on and the food is pretty good! I love the Thai Sweet Chili Vings. They keep me coming back. They also have a great late night if your looking to grab a quick bite late at night."}
{"text":"Love this place! The 6 dollar burger deal on Monday nights is great, and so is happy hour.

I have never had a bad time at the vig and look forward to going here every Monday with my partner and friends. The staff here is wonderful too.

Sunday brunch is always a good time too! I love the monte cristo sandwich"}
{"text":"First time going to any of The Vig outlets and can't wait to explore the other locations. The food was excellent and our waitress was on the ball. My fiancé had the fried chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries (which I stole because no one could pass them up). I had the Asian chopped salad, we both cleaned our plates. The only downside was the location didn't have enough parking and we took a gamble on where to park. Thankfully the host was right and our car was still there after we finished. We just need to find the right location and we'll be regulars."}
{"text":"Simply delicious food & service.  Drinks, tacos, wings & postole. Sean was quite possibly one of the best waiter/bartenders that we've had in Arizona the entire week we've been here.  This gentleman certainly knows the menu, and knows his game. Really personable and quick.  What else could you want.   Just request this guy when you get in here an you'll know your taken care of. 

*update*  so we had such a great experience, we went once more before we left Phoenix.  We drove over 2 hours from Sadona so we didn't have to order off the late night menu.  We sat down at the bar at 9:52pm. Bartender came over at 9:58pm with late night menu saying that it's past 10.   Not sure who he was, kinda Mexican looking his with a beesnest hair doo.  He was nice, but ignored us mostly.  2nd experience kinda sucked."}
{"text":"The nachos were good. The service was fine. When I got up to pee, a cat stole my chair (I am not joking). 

Minus one star for mandatory valet."}
{"text":"Go on Monday get the $5 dollerrrr make you hollerrrr special. I got the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. My burger was delicious! Juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were good, not awesome, they could have been a tad more crisp.

I also got a cocktail that had strawberry and basil muddled with citrus vodka and lemonade. Very refreshing! I've had this combo before and the Vig's version was superior to what I've had before. Although it was $9 it better be good, right!?"}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would rate this place 1-3 stars, seems pretty harsh.  It may be slightly pricey, but it has a great atmosphere, fun, trendier, relaxed, and the food is A+.  My favorite is the Vigazz burger with the side salad/ranch.  It's great.  I've also had their pasta tortellini, it was amazing but I didn't see it on the menu that last time I was in; I think they have some seasonal dishes they switch up.
Great place for a group/younger crowd."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and service is done quickly. My kids love hanging out on the patio near the fire place. Dress warm so you can sit outside, the inside is small."}
{"text":"Staff was great, food good. Way too hot in there!"}
{"text":"Great Service, Good Food, and Great Ambiance!

My girlfriend and I visited on Tuesday night and practically had the place to ourselves which is nice because every other time I have been here, it's been packed! So keep that in mind. The service was awesome, and the food was even better! I would recommend the bacon mac and cheese.

Music selections were awesome as well! 
Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food good - French Dip and Happy Hour sliders.
Ambience - Very Good
Beer - Warm
Service - Warm"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you want a great atmosphere and great food, BUT unfortunately the service was horrible. Being a server I know there are good days and bad days, but being rude the customers for something as simple as split checks is not acceptable. Kayla (our server) was obviously having a bad day, but this negatively affected our experience. Management was awesome!"}
{"text":"Although the place seems a bit pretentious even before you walk in the door, I was pretty impressed with it. We didn't bother with the valet parking even though it was $3. We used the $3 on our drinks instead. The food was good. We got the artichoke dip, five spice edamame and the Frenchy sandwich and shared it all. We were pretty impressed with the food and liked the atmosphere. It was crazy loud in there even for a Sunday night but I suppose that's because it was half off wine bottles those nights. There was a band playing on the patio too. Luckily for the patio dwellers, there are misters that kept them cool in the 100-degree evening.

The Vig has its own scene going on. So if you're not one of the in-crowd, be prepared to be aggressive to get a drink at the bar. The hostesses seem a little cliquish as well.

Overall, it was money and time well-spent for two visitors from San Diego. We'd go back."}
{"text":"Best pub grub in town! This is such a go-to place for me and my family! The menu is creative but not weird, and it's diverse without being too large and cumbersome. You can choose from burgers, sandwiches, entree salads, and main courses such as fish tacos or short ribs.

The ingredients used are fresh and the food is well-prepared. We come here and eat really well but still are very healthy, OR we come here and splurge on calories and dive into chili tornitos (queso, chorizo, and bacon), piled high burgers with onion rings, and mason jar dessert (mud pie, strawberry shortcake, or banana cream pie). Many menu items are labeled gluten free or can be made gluten free upon request. They have a great kids menu as well.

We really love the vibe of The Vig. It's laid back and casual but not so much so that it becomes a hole in the wall. Just a chill and mellow place for friends to enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"The saying goes \"Let's just go to the Vig\" always seems to apply. Just can't go wrong. Good food, good people, good times."}
{"text":"The Vig rocks.  The biggest, best priced Hangar One martinis in town and the food is always excellent.  After 3 years in the neighborhood, the Vig has become an Arcadia fixture.  The staff are among the best and friendliest in town and then there is the food.  Always very tasty and fresh, with a great variety.  The specials make it even more difficult to decide what to order!

The best part of the Vig is Sunday Funday/Sunday School on the patio.  On a sunny Sunday afternoon, there is no better place to be in Phoenix.  I took two friends there who were in from Seattle and Raleigh to run the Rock n Roll Marathon to celebrate their run, and it was  a hit!  

The Vig never disappoints."}
{"text":"We love the Vig and come here often for drinks and food.  The pork belly appetizers the bomb.  One star away from 5 because they always seem understaffed and it takes forever for service on the weekend, but the half price bottles of wine make up for it on Sundays."}
{"text":"Made it for happy hour and enjoyed great food and drink. Hot Vings and sliders were some of the best I've tasted. The fries that came with the sliders were perfectly cooked. The jalapeno crema that accompanied the cheese stuffed tater tots was so good that I dipped everything in it. Some of the appetizers were almost half price for happy hour but I would've been happy to pay full price for that quality of food."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place to hang out, very good food and atmosphere. I give it 4 stars because I believe there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"We just ordered take out from the Vig .. OMG.. they did steak and salmon perfectly. The veggies we're perfect.. service was amazing. We just love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The Vig is the the perfect go to spot for a let night drink in my book. The patio is great, you can usually get a table, and the crowd is low key but friendly/fun."}
{"text":"Love the Vig! The service, food, and atmosphere are fantastic! The Mac and cheese is stellar and always a kid favorite- they added it to the regular menu and it is awesome- add chicken, sausage, bacon or broccoli in it is fantastic! Other favorites the deconstructed tacos, the flatiron steak (although slightly better at the uptown location because they crush the pistachios there), and the wings - regular or this spicy are among the best around!"}
{"text":"Really cool spot and great food. Love the feel of the place"}
{"text":"Love this place - my favorite is chopped salad with grilled salmon. 
A little bit pricey but I am OK with the quality of food, service and the atmosphere there."}
{"text":"The Vig is a great, upscale dinner/drinking hole with style, character and flair. The service is fantastic.  The food consistently good.  The parking absolutely sucks (so pay the measly $3 and valet it bitches!).

Things I like about The Vig:
- great outdoor patio with smoking section
- great outdoor fireplace renders the patio warm & comfortable in the cooler months
- consistently good service; attentive, affording, knowledgeable & friendly
- hot bear DJ on Friday nites
- bacci ball court on the side
- Trivial Pursuit cards at the tables

Their sweet potato fries with curry-mayo ROCK MY WORLD, and the grilled chicken sandwich ain't bad either!  In fact, all of the food I've tasted here is awesome.

You can buy wine by the glass or the bottle and heir beers on tap provide a nice (if not somewhat mass-appeal) offering. I usually opt for the Stella on tap, but that's me.

All in all, great experience and very reasonable prices.  It gets VERY packed in the evenings, espec. Thurs-Sat and as I mentioned, valet is a must."}
{"text":"Came out from LA to visit a friend here in Phoenix.... got off the plane and first stop: The Vig!!

Everything on the menu looked so good... I couldnt decide... my friend said the Carne Asada was SUUUUUPER good. Sooooo, that's what I got and let me TELL YOU... it was BOMB. 

Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake: sliced carne asada on a potato pancake with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce

For people familiar with the LA area.... this place has the same look, feel and vibe of Beechwood in Venice. 

Go here!! Its YUM!!"}
{"text":"I cant wait for the weekend!
Somebody buy me a Vig shirt...i will be the dumb ass poster child wearing it around.


Taking a quick break from The Vig Uptown, my mates and I take the extend trip to the original Vig. Letting the drama simmer down a little bit is my plan and exploring new lands is in hand. 

I really enjoy the uptown location, so maybe this place had no chance at the 5* from the beginning. Never the less here is what I like:

::The outdoor patio is larger and chattier

{"text":"what a cool place to hang with friends.      i LOVE the vibe.      indoors or outdoors, this is the kind of place i enjoy spending time.     i have had both lunch and dinner and the food has been tasty & savory.  (great sweet potato fries)

the staff has always been friendly, quirky, & efficient....

bloody marys on sunday mornings are a good call and there is often jazz on sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"We just went over for drinks. Our friend had the Mac &a Cheese and she said it was really good. She even got some wings to go cuz her man loves them. The outdoor seating was super chill, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely obnoxious. Other than that I think it's super cool and chill place to hang and drink."}
{"text":"Hip hop skeddle dee doo dop you'll feel like a jive turkey on thanksgiving eve, even if your a human being. I ingested nachos and did the cha cha slide sideways because it sent my intestines into oh la la land ( cheese and beans and jalapeños and such fine things) dancing salsa dancers on the tortilla of your soul, now thats what I call music. I shall return for more indeed."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could.  The vibe at this place is cool, it is hipster.  We went on a Tuesdaay and it was packed.   We sat at the bar and ordered the following:

Chicken wings in Thai chile sauce - fried then grilled - blue cheese was very good - overall delicious!
Rib basket with skinny french fries - excellent flavor and crispy flies
Banana nut bread pudding with carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream - OMG

Great bar food and the drinks were interesting as well.

Suit and Tie - Oatmeal stout beer/grey goose cherry vodka, soda water and something else.  it was inventive and good.  it wasn't too sweet
I had \"the Loop\" sauvignon blanc - actually the best SB I have ever had - very cirtrusy and cold.

Service was good, although not overly friendly.

Definitely worth going back to...."}
{"text":"So here is my take on the Vig, if you are trying to \"not be scottsdale, but really you are scottsdale\" the VIg is the place to go.  Its for the \"hipster scottsdale crowd that thinks they are escaping scottsdale only to realize everyone from scottsdale is there, ha ha.  I am not saying i don't like this place  . . . . but for being in Phoenix there were a ton of Scottsdale LA Fitness guys from my gym there, weird?

Anyway time for my real review.  They have awesome happy hour food at cheap prices.  So a great place for dinner/hh.  When the weather is nice its good to go, since the majority of the bar is outside.  I like the crowd at the VIg, a bit older (27-40) and more refined, he he.  

Another pro they offer free rides home if you get too drunk, so drink up!"}
{"text":"Another one of those Arcadia bars that everyone raves about that I feel is overrated.  My friends who live in Biltmore drag me to The Vig often.  Its small.  The happy hour only goes til 6 and the food is just ok.  I have had the hummus, the burgers, and the sweet potato fries- nothing special but not bad by any means.  Service has been good.  The outdoor area is nice.  Thats all I have to say about the Vig.  I wish my friends would stop dragging me here and find a new spot.  Im bored."}
{"text":"I go here more for the ambiance and less for the actual food. The food isn't bad, but also not amazing. The French dip meat is not thin enough and doesn't make sense for it to be on a pretzel bun. 

Last time I was there I got the mac n cheese which was bomb, but the $2 add on of chorizo was a joke. There was barely any in there. 

The drinks are good and the vibe is awesome. Always receive good service, too."}
{"text":"The last time I was at The Vig, they tricked me.. You see, they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out, and sometimes, when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo, they close them on you, so like an asshole, you attempt to walk back outside the way you came, but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people. Be mindful of this.

But hey, at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow. And then I hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where I somehow acquired 200 bruises. 

I love the Vig. Even when I'm embarrassing the shit out of myself."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this 2 star is because I usually love the food there, this time I didn't get any so can't say anything about food. 

I was sat at a table on the patio and so was other people around same time as me. I waited for server to come around for about 10 minutes to get a drink or water and then gave my self another 5-10 min because I felt embarrassed to get up and walk out. So had to simple leave because no one ever acknowledged my table."}
{"text":"WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD IN YEARS!!! I took a long time friend out for a birthday dinner.  Let me start by saying the only saving grace was the outstanding server Aaron Barnett who was excellent and should find a manager to work under who matches his skill set.  We ordered an appetizer and some drinks.  We moved on and ordered a brand new item (we were told later) which was the flat iron steak.  Both steak dinners including the vegetables were cool and under cooked.  We immediately reported the poor meal to the waiter.  After about a half hour wait, they brought us two more meals which were also cold and under cooked exactly the same as before.  I sent mine back and my friend reported his to the manager -Jasmine as being cold, but he was starving and needed to leave soon and ate a small portion of the meal.  Another half hour passed and I received my replacement meal (salmon) and it was hot.  After 4 under cooked steak dinners and both he and I eating dinner 1/2 hour apart and almost two hours later the manager Jasmine came to our table to explain they just added the Flat Iron steak to the menu and they are having problems with it and no apology - at all.  Soon after our bill arrived.  Remember... all 4 steak dinners were under cooked and my friend only took a few bites and gave up.  We were charged full price and the bill showed an amount subtracted that should have been for 3 of the 4 bad steak meals.  Guess what - the math did not add up and we were charged 4 dollars more than we should have been.  The waiter and the manager Jasmine could not figure out how Jasmine did the math.  Simply, Aaron came back without an explanation, embarrassed and with the same bill.  At this point I gave up and could not wait to get home write this review.  I tipped Aaron 20% because he was the only one who knew his job.  The manager Jasmine did not care in the least about our experience -  side note, as we left Aaron approached us with a couple $1 dollar off drink coupons which I passed on. He also gave us his General Manager's Card which I considered both responsible and thoughtful.  The Vig took what should have been a wonderful birthday dinner and ruined the entire evening.  I wish we would have selected a better managed restaurant to celebrate at."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Walked in on Sunday around 1 and had the best time! The weather was absolutely perfect and I immediately loved how open their indoor/outdoor dining room was. Decided to sit on their patio and learned they had live music! My son who is 2 1/2 really enjoyed being able to be outside, eat great food, and enjoy the music. 

We ordered gauc, which was very fresh and had a nice spice to it, kids Mac and cheese, which was phenomenal, beet salad, which was also delicious, and a chicken sandwich. Every single item we had was impressive. 

Service was great too- our waitress recommended everything and she was right. Great place to visit! Thanks Vig!"}
{"text":"I've been debating on whether or not to give this spot two or three stars.  I used to be a huge fan of everything about the Vig.  Great Patio, Great Bar, Great Food, Great Laughs, but the one thing that was never great was the parking.  They have a valet, but it always seems to be full, so you started to park across the street, well that parking is now always full.

The Vig has been struck from the list of places that I frequent, because I hate to wait for a table at a neighborhood grill, and because I hate to park a half mile away for a chicken sandwich.

The Vings (get it...Vig WIngs...Vings) are very good to start off, and every single meal that I have enjoyed is excellent.  They have a rotating beer tap that is usually something delicious, and very enjoyable.  The cocktails are strong, but not too strong.

The patio is one of the best in town.  They did a great job of giving it character and limiting the view of the crap shopping center across the street.

This is another great Phoenix establishment in the likes of LGO, Chelsea's, The Parlour, etc, but the parking has turned me off to the point that I don't even think about it any more.  It's such a shame that a great establishment has to be ruined by those in Scottsdale and Tempe that make the drive to our neighborhood grills!!"}
{"text":"Okay Pro: the atmosphere on any spring sunday on the patio makes it worth five stars all by itself.
Con: can't I get a well drink special on said sundays?
Pro: half off all bottles of wine though!  even my favorite, sonoma cutrer.
Con: the manager (who was named after a cooking spray, no more info than that for you) doesn't appreciate drunk stupidity.  I know this, because she doesn't appreciate me when I'm drunk and stupid--according to sources--and i am the very epitome of drunk stupidity.  Now, wouldn't you, if you were a bar manager, realize that the very life blood of your business is drunk ppl making bad decisions?  Come ON people?

Sorry about the aside.  Pro: the quesadilla they have is goddamn good--it even has shrooms in it which I ordinarily avoid.  But solid food, drink, and atmosphere give this place 5 stars for me.  With a 1 star deduction:)"}
{"text":"Well the layout sells this place all by itself. Very comfortable spot and it's easy to stay for hours. However, one of the contributors to being able to stay for hours, is because of how slow the service is. Took about ten minutes to be greeted and another 10-15 for first round of drinks. I had the Swisskey Nickel Sandwich (on ciabatta instead of pumpernickel [which was cool the server made sure I knew it wasn't a big deal]) Not too shabby. Couldn't taste any horseradish in the mayo...and the cranberry chutney, is more like a preserve...but good flavor overall and sweet pot fries were pretty spot on...didn't care the dipping sauce.
Their Arizona Stronghold \"Mangus\" is not as Big as I expected...for the price, and for where it's listed on the menu. SO in a nutshell...great layout to hang with some friends or fam and chat it up (A+). Service is splotchy (C+) (never even knew my servers name) and the food is good (B). 

OH!!! I do owe the server some Kudos for hooking it up with the discount we had asked about a little earlier than he was supposed to."}
{"text":"The atmospehere and food here are amazing!  I have only been for lunch and both times the food has blown me away.  It is so fresh and the options fit every taste!

I can see where the problems others have written about the servers come from, sometimes they are not the most attentive, however, I generally have had refills regularly and it didn't seem as we waited too long for anything.  The servers a lot of times just seemed to be more into socializing than attending to customers.

I would recommend the Vig for lunch, brunch and I am sure dinner is just as delicious!  I hope to get back soon for dinner, as the patio is just beauitful and such a great space!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out last night around 6. It was super busy and loud, but there were some tables open near the patio so we grabbed on there. Got an appetizer flatbrea- BBQ Chicken with jalepenos, cheddar cheese, red onions-- it was AMAZING. I even picked off some ingredients I don't like, but the taste was out of this world.

For dinner we both had 'The Hot Chick\" chicken sandwich. It was absolutely amazing. It had this spicy avocado mayo, and the fries were outstanding.

Our server was this adorable girl who was super helpful, kept a good eye on our table and made sure we had everything we needed. 

The only reason this is 4 not 5 stars is because I personally didn't like how loud it was. Once it cools down I will definitely be checkin out the patio."}
{"text":"I had chosen this place in Arcadia as a good spot to hang with my boys. Surprisingly, the experience was great. The ambience was serene and filled with lively people. 

The portions of food per order were more than expected. I had ordered the holy Mac n cheese with jalapeños. The order was a large bowl... Much bigger than I thought it would be. The cheese was rich and flavorful.  The food was heavy but really tasty -- a must try!

I think the service could be improved -- felt as if we would not get our waitress back for half hour if we didn't place our order when she arrived.  The wait time was longer in some cases. But that was excusable for the tasty experience."}
{"text":"As always the food and service was great. I love the Hot Chick or VigAzz burger. Oh and get the chips with salsa and guacamole. It was all so good that I had my college graduation there."}
{"text":"Won't be back as I was charged $2.50 for a soda water. This is the first time and I complained to the manageress but to no avail. Also, I contacted The Vig and I'm still waiting for a response since the 8th March. Plenty of other restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"I love their weekend brunch menu...especially $3 mimosa.  I have been to both Fillmore locations but both locations are awesome.   I will be a regular costumer for weekend brunch and I will try weekend evening."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.  I'm surprised by the poor reviews.  

I had the best and most unique sandwich in a very long time.  The server (Tessa) was fabulous, friendly and efficient.  I enjoyed the wine I ordered and everything about the place, as well as Meow Meow, the resident cat who makes herself more than comfortable on the cushioned couch.

I had the \"Love Me Tenderloin\" Sandwich.  OMG!  It was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I have not raved about a meal at a restaurant in a loooong time.  It was juicy, tasty, messy, yummy.  I chose side salad with it.  I also had the edamame and took that home because I had to finish the sandwich.  It was that good.

I came here from Minnesota to escape the winter.  A couple girlfriends are joining me here and I have been scoping places to take them.  I will take them here.  They will love it.  

Yeah, it is a bit pricy, but I got much better value here than I did at Terroir Wine Pub.  Far friendlier service, more food and better food!

If you are in Phoenix and dont' know where to go, go here.  It has a great patio, fabulous service, friendly staff, great food and wine.    You could go here and then to Postino before or after.  They are within a couple miles of each other. 

I loved the overhead music.  Not too obtrusive, just right.  Overall a FABULOUS experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and the food was BOMB. The happy hour menu is really cheap and features some really good choices. I came here with my boyfriend and we both shared the pretzel sliders (which came with fries - yum!) and bbq wings. Both dishes were delicious! And they came with more food than I was expecting, I got so full! I also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. If you sit in a booth and look up, there's art right above you! Staff is very friendly as well. Great spot for a date or to just hang out and have a drink with friends. But beware, the parking sucks! Still will definitely be coming back though!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The Vig. All three of them. Great place to hang out and lounge around. They don't fuss if you come in for just a drink without food. There are heaters and fireplaces to cozy up around. Service always friendly. Varied menu to pick from. Come check it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"I had the steak and it was delicious, as were the sides. 
Server was very attentive but food took a long time. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with really great drinks and brunch. The staff was super nice, especially our server, Brandon"}
{"text":"Solid atmosphere. Love the outdoor seating. Obsessed with their dipping sauce for their sweet potato fries. Sweet, spicy and savory. What more could you ask for in a sauce? Let's be real tho life begins after your first bite of BBQ wings. God spent a little more time on them ;)"}
{"text":"From what I've heard, The Vig is quite the hot spot for bronzed local youngsters to collaborate over food, fun, and the occasional dabble in over-imbibing on Sunday Funday. While I can't say I've had the opportunity to day drink in this lovely venue, I can attest that they don't do a bad job with the food + fun part.

Popped in last night for a little post-work snack, and it's pretty clear that the place is a veritable who's who with enough good looking people milling about to to fill an auditorium of extras for the set of Bring It On 3 (was there even a pt. 2?). 

In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.

On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city. In the immortal words of Charlie Sheen, \"Winner!\""}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, the main reason being that it's right around the corner from home.  I support many of the neighborhood businesses, but just cannot find a reason to support the Vig.  

I've been a few times and have been seated both inside and out, and I'm a huge fan of the space, and the ambiance.  But my last visit was horrible.  We were seated and waiting, waiting, waiting for service.  There were a fair amount of empty tables, and they didn't appear to be understaffed.  

Finally some girls doing a promo for a vodka label came to our table and offered us free Moscow Mules to start the night.  So we accepted.  And while that was very nice, no waiter ever came to our table.  We had planned to eat at the Vig, but after 45 minutes we finally just left and went someplace else.  

I will say that the parking lot valet was awesome.  He kept our car in one of the few spots right by the front door, so at least it was easy for us to get out of there and on to someplace better."}
{"text":"The Vig is outstanding. Came here while visiting Phoenix and tried the Trifecta with sweet potato fries. It was so good, the first night after moving to Phoenix we went back. 

Staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is great, day or night. 

This is a place we'll keep coming back to."}
{"text":"I give everyone a fair chance and I am a foodie and wine lover but I put the Vig on blast! I have frequented this bar/restaurant in the past merely for their atmosphere, pretty scenery and great patio; however, more than a few times the service has been downright unprofessional and staff rude from time to time. 

I was recently in the restaurant with a fairly large party and we all ended up with food poisoning from the hummus and baba ganoush. I wasn't so upset that it happened because it's a risk one takes but what happened after I will never forget. After nicely calling the manager Pam, I only wanted to inform her of what had happened so that others would not get sick and she quickly became defensive and told me that it was impossible we could get sick on hummus. Sadly but true in my opinion she must have never taken a food safety class. As most of us know bacteria can grow in protein and hummus is all protein. She argued me and I quickly responded with the fact that eight people getting sick is no coincidence. As a manager in the past, it's right to sympathize with the customer, not defend. I wanted nothing from her but she quickly told me she would tell the chef and \"sorry, hope you feel better\", and she hung up the phone. This tells me the Vig's management is not only unprofessional but downright awful. 

I never thought their food was that great anyway and it's a step up from bar food but if you want drink menus tossed at your table, long waits before being greeted, rude staff and food poisoning, then check out the Vig. If you don't want to park in valet, be careful parking in the check cashing parking lot because it can be dangerous crossing that busy street."}
{"text":"No surprise that this place has so many 5 star reviews, it's because they deserve it!!! With an eclectic menu, a helpful staff, an ambiance that's very original and killer cocktails, there is nothing not to love. Whenever I have visitors in town The Vig is one of the first places I take them. I love the neighborhood cats that hang outside, the occasional live music, the outdoor fireplace and last but not least, their Mac n Cheese is the greatest thing on the face of the earth!!! Prepare to have to valet your car, and prepare to be in a food coma when you leave!"}
{"text":"I love The Vig's casual, yet trendy atmosphere. It's the perfect place to meet up with friends after work, and can also be very romantic for a date. I've been on a Wednesday when an awesome live acoustic duo played covers of 90s rock songs (Oasis, Foo Fighters, & Gin Blossoms - you had me at \"Wonderwall\"!).

The menu is awesome (fries of any sort are highly recommended) and the wine selection is decent enough as well. Service is always extraordinary. My only complaint? The parking is super inconvenient. But I'd park two blocks away for those fries."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio dining area. Great happy hour. Great service.

Outdoor patio dining has a beautiful mesquite tree for ambiance and blocking out the sun while the center fireplace keeps you warm. 

We had:
Queso Skillet with warm tortilla chips - amazing!
Mac N Cheese with Chorizo - fabulous! one of the best mac n cheeses I've ever had!
Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake - was ok. Sounded excellent, tasted decent.

Friendly and good food. But the ambiance really puts it over the top as a great dining experience. I'd be back with a group of friends to lounge, play cornsack or bocce ball during happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't have a broad perspective of this place because I only go their for lunch on Thursday's. That being said, I have been there for lunch over 30 times so I feel I have a good grasp of this place on that particular day of the week. But  I have heard that the nights are pretty fun and Sundays 1/2 price Vino is pretty stellar. 
The Vig is minimalist and modern which is clean and pleasing to my eye. The bar is nice and long and is (wo) manned by the Lovely Susan. She is one of the valley's classiest and most engaging barkeeps. Jimmy, the congenial owner, is typically shaking hands and verifying his patrons enjoyment.
Valet parking and a limited number of private lot spots are available.There also seems to be a solid rotation of cute hostesses to greet you upon entry.
The lunch menu is minimalist but pleasing, every item I have ordered has been satisfactory. It is a great place to watch afternoon golf or other sports at the bar. The patio and bocce ball court are lively and fun for happy hour in nice weather.
The clientele is an equal ratio of male and female 25-60 year old professionals for lunch, I have been told that it gets a bit sexier when the sun goes down."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Parking does suck. I don't understand why they have valet but it was cheap so we used it. 

A major plus here is their patio. It appears to be bigger than the restaurant and you can play boci ball! It was over a hundred degrees when I was here celebrating a friend's engagement and they turned off the misters. WHY??? The fans were still going but they didn't help much. I tried some appetizers. The artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese. I though the guac and salsa were better. And the service was so slow. We were here for 2 hours and only had 2 drinks and not by choice. 

I actually came here during Yelp Eats week and was never informed that they were participating. We were only given regular menus. After I found out that they were a participating restaurant a couple of days after our visit I asked some of the other people who had been there if they were ever offered the alternative menu and not one person said they had. 

Lame."}
{"text":"I felt more hip just walking into this place! The Vig is close to work and since it was a slow day the day after Thanksgiving, a few of us decided to go for lunch here. This place is definitely an \"upscale neighborhood tavern,\" with indoor and outdoor seating and an extensive drinks menu. We ended up with a table on the patio; at first, we found it a tad chilly, but after our nice server moved a heatlamp closer to our table, we felt much better. I ordered the \"Vigan\" sandwich (loaded with siracha hummus, avocado, tomato, grilled zucchini and squash) and selected the sweet potato fries as my side. Everything was really good! Portion size is generous (I took half of my sandwich home). My table of 3 shared a brownie for dessert and it was a good thing we did because that brownie was rich and dense. I am looking forward to my next visit, hopefully during happy hour!"}
{"text":"The best bar food in Phoenix. Actually, calling it \"bar food\" almost seems denigrating, this is just very tasty cuisine.

Hot chick sandwich, best turkey, mahi-mahi sandwich, nachos, soup - all are excellent. I did not review this place until I'd eaten here a few times, because I wanted to see if they could deliver top notch quality consistently. They exceeded my expectations, which is why they deserve a 5 star rating.

 Happy hour ( 3-6 pm) has 1/2 price appetizers, $2 off wine and other drink specials. They also have Odell's IPA on tap, which means they are serious about good beer.

Parking sucks but so does every other place in that area. Really nice atmosphere - good lighting and great patio, but can get really crowded at night, so come early."}
{"text":"I mean I just got the classic burger and sweet potato fries and was blown away? I'll come back."}
{"text":"Such an easy going place for HH or any occasion. Met up w a good friend and there's no way we could have come up with a complaint. We sat at the bar and all 3 bartenders (even with shift change) were super attentive and food came out so quickly and timely fashioned. Best sweet potato fries and the guac was amazing! The bartender Ryan is your guy."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to have them hand me a bill for such a large amount and when I mentioned it they said \"oh ya there is a tip in there already\" weren't going to tell me there was already a tip added for 22%!!!! A little high I'd say....  Really disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a \"Vig\"ilante in the restaurant business. Their white fish tacos are literally the freaking bomb. I got mine without the spicy slaw and substituted lettuce with no problem. I also purchased the beer that was on special and it came out promptly. I went on a Thursday night and the place was poppin with a Dj and a cool dude on a trumpet. This is seriously such a cool place, I can't stress it enough. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of The Vig! Since it is a block away from our home, it is definitely safe to say that we're regulars. When the weather is nice, we LOVE sitting on their outdoor patio. A few of my foodie favorites are their 40th Street Nachos (LOADED with so much goodness), Steamed Edamame (Soy Garlic -- I do miss the 5 spice!!), Holy Mac & Cheese (add Bacon or Broccoli) & It is seriously AMAZING! The best in the valley in my opinion. Which is saying a lot because I consider myself a Mac & Cheese connoisseur. ;) & the Hot Chick. 

They have fabulous Happy Hour specials Monday - Friday from 3 PM - 6 PM. A few highlights from the HH menu include; $5 Sliders (3 per order), $5 daily flatbread, $3.50 Steamed Edamame, $4 Guac (heavenly) & Chips, $5 Hot Vings, $2 off cocktails & premium spirits, $2 off wine, $1.50 off draft and premium beer. Every Sunday they have 1/2 off bottles of wine. They also have daily specials that are fantastic. They currently have $4 Tito's Vodka drinks all day err day {Until the end of September}.

Entertainment: 
Bocce Court
Tuesday, Wednesday & Sunday: Live Music {Elvis Before Noon is amazing!}
Thursday - Saturday: DJ
You can check out their events calendar to see who is playing! You can also order late night eats until 1 AM (AND Yes, the Nachos AND Mac & Cheese are on the late night menu... thank goodness!!)"}
{"text":"Always a great place. All the locations are consistent with vibe/food/beverages/scene...VIG downtown tends to bring out the power group scene..but no one comes w/attitude. The Vig version of the mule does not disappoint. 
Shockingly, the posole is great. 
The only knock is they recently seemed to have changed the kind of champagne they serve with their mimosas..which only means don't order the mimosa. 

Overall, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Trendy spot in the heart of Phoenix. More of a bar style restaurant with a super cute outside patio area. 

Quite a variety of food from some pretty amazing posole to a refreshing Asian chicken salad. 

Our server was friendly. Very welcoming.

They have multiple locations so check them out"}
{"text":"Sadly, I am basically only updating this review because I am obsessed with their turkey sandwich. It's that good. I don't need to write anything else. Oh wait, yes I do. Pretzel bun. Pretzel. Bun. Ok, now this review is complete."}
{"text":"Hipster is an understatement, but I learned to see past that and the \"interesting\" people really quick! After my first bite of the Filet-o-Fish and their sweet potatoes fries with that oh so addicting curry mayonnaise! Yum! I have also had their summer shrimp salad, steak salad, fish tacos and several other things. All delicious! I have figured out that no matter what I order, the chef behind the menu knows his food! They really understand how to create depth and develop flavors. 
By the way, their dinner menu is much better than their brunch/lunch menu, so go AFTER 2!
Wish their service was a little better, but LOVE their food and would suggest this to anyone and everyone! A Phoenix Must try!"}
{"text":"Service a little slow:  They tired to seat us at a 8 top communal table outside, even though we asked to be sat inside and there was two 5-top booths open. The waitress really wasn't around for it not being that busy and came to check on us far and few between.. food 5stars. Service 2stars. Really sucks because this was supposed be a great place suggested by a friend but we will find another joint to eat for our Bi-weekly visits to AZ."}
{"text":"While I can appreciate the appeal of having a disinterested, gay, hipster server who is probably really good at bullshitting about wine, I found the overall ambiance and service sort of off putting.  

The boyfriend and I waited a good ten minutes before someone came over to take our drink order though I noticed the server eying our table long before then.  I imagine he thought perhaps we were NOT, in fact, disinterested, gay hipsters who could bullshit about wine but rather low-end Mesa kids tired of slumming it at the local dive so we thought we'd treat ourselves to someplace awful nice like The Vig.

Except, The Vig is only \"meh.\"

The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday, the fries are awesome, the drink specials are mediocre, the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly, the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the \"totally modern, contempo art deco\" bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee.

I got a couple vodka sodas and they were lacking in the \"alcohol\" department which is sort of the only reason I order them.  They were also served in some stupid, pretentious glass. 

Overall, the experience seemed dark (maybe cause there were no windows) and sort of awkward and I found myself wanting to leave pretty quickly.  

I can appreciate some hip little lounges where people go out to be seen and maybe pretend that the food is amazing; but The Vig is like the douche bag dude you see driving a BMW with his top down even though it's 6 a.m. and 20 degrees outside.  I assume his account is overdrawn and his girlfriend says she's an artist but really she's a server at Oregano's.

I think what it is though, and I realized this as I scoffed at the sparkling silver, super modern sink fixtures in the woman's bathroom (with a door cleverly labeled with a giant \"W\" for women? get it? \"W\" is for women), that mostly I'm just a stiff drinks-cheap-food-sticky floors-tore-up-waitresses dive bar girl at heart."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan, but so bummed they changed the menu. A PLUS, they have pozole on the menu, a super negative in my opinion: no more VIG portobello burger. So sad."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We are from out of town and were looking for a restaurant that wasn't a national chain. This place fit the bill. The interior is modern with a natural feel. The outside patio blends seamlessly with the interior space when the doors are open. I had the turkey sandwich and my coworker had the fish tacos and we both loved our food. The Brussels sprout sides are a must try. The customer service was excellent and we were checked on by multiple people during our visit. My only negatives are that the inside is very dark. I could see that being an issue for some people. Also, the beer selection was just Meh. There was only one local beer on tap, Kilt Lifter, and I really enjoy trying new craft beer when I'm traveling. This seems like the kind of cool place that would offer that. Get there during happy hour for discount food and drinks, and to avoid a long line at the mandatory \"complimentary\" valet parking."}
{"text":"Good spot to hit the trendy Phoenix - Arcadia nightlife social scene.  Great food and they try their best with the drinks although I stick with a simple beer when I frequent.  Play a little bocci ball on the patio and enjoy your evening because good things happen when you go to the Vig."}
{"text":"I like this place,  I love sitting in the patio area while it is still less than 100 degrees.  Last time I was there we went for brunch.  I have a delicious Montecristo sandwich, super yummy.  My little boy had the sliders and he kept saying they were the best he has ever had.  I am glad they are opening a location near me, however this one seems to have a certain vibe that is pretty nice."}
{"text":"Met with a few friends here and had a couple of beers here, but the ambiance was so great for a Sunday afternoon.  I think  I would call it an urbanscape.  Where trees meet sky at twilight and there is a an outdoor fire crackling behind sterile glass in the center of this shady outdoor lounge.  Clienele look like a Ralph Lauren commercial...which isn't the restaurants fault, but we all like beaultiful things....  

I can tell it get busier at night, but I can tell I prefer this place on a mellow Sunday afternoon.  

Great concept!"}
{"text":"First trip to Phoenix. My good friends picked this place for dinner. It was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was so charming. I loved the way the back of the restaurant opened onto the patio. The soft music of the jazz band was entertaining. I recommend the Fish tacos but my friend had the salmon and both dishes were presented well and so tasty. The staff was so attentive and friendly. Thanks for making my last meal in Phoenix memorable."}
{"text":"Was double charged for my party of 15, they all paid separately and at the end of the night they told me no one had paid and made me pay $500 tab. Turns out most of the table had already paid."}
{"text":"I only came here for happy hour once during a quick visit to Phoenix for a drink and appetizer, but if you like wings -- try the Thai chili wings. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We ordered the citrus shrimp salad and had them prepare the mahi mahi dish but inserted salmon instead. The waitress easily made the substitution.  We were outside on the very cool patio with the big wood burning fireplace. There was a guy playing his guitar and singing.  The atmosphere was good. There were some little kids playing on corn hole game"}
{"text":"Food is always great. Service can be slow at times. I hate being forced to valet when there are plenty of OPEN and unmarked spots. The valets (slow) bully you into giving them your keys all to secure a tip. Valet should be an option not required."}
{"text":"The Vig has a big comfy patio with soft couches, long tables and the occasional cat napping (what?). They have  heaters and an outdoor fireplace so its great regardless of the weather and your body temperature. If you are more into watching NFL Sunday  and staying away from nature, the indoors is small but fully equipped with flat screens showing the major games and scores. 

Although I only visited the Vig for brunch, I was pretty happy with their overall menu, food quality and service. The $5 Mimosa/Bloody Mary brunch special is pretty decent but some of their more signature, full-priced cocktails (like the van goh vodka with coffee and milk) definitely needs to kick it up a couple notches and stop skimping on the good ingredients (read:booze). At a table of 3, we ordered the hangover helper, shepherds pie and the tofu scramble- 3 very unique menu breakfast/brunch menu items that I was excited to try.

The tofu scramble (pictured) comes in a burrito but to be honest, the best way to eat it is sans tortilla bread and topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs. The mixture of grilled firm tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, chilies and assorted veggies is surprisingly spicy and full of flavor. However, since it doesn't come with any cheese or sauce, the yolk from the eggs on top boost up the dish by a factor of 10 and make it an amazing hearty (yet healthy) meal. Too bad the eggs don't come with the dish (gotta ask for it extra). 

If the whole veggie/vegan/hippie roll ain't your thing, then the shepherds pie is probably the manliest breakfast you can get there. Giant piece of juicy steak and eggs sitting on a giant bed of potatoes, cheese, beans, corns and pretty much every ingredient in the kitchen. Its served on a giant skillet and will truly make you feel like a caveman eating for the next year. Props if you can finish eat, its a LOT of food. If that STILL seems too healthy for you, the hangover helper is another skillet drowning in baked tortilla, sauce and about 20lbs of melted cheese into one gooey dish. It tastes exactly like what you crave at 4am after doing too many jager-bombs in Old town. It comes with eggs, but instead it should comes with an additional 20lbs of hot sauce to accompany the cheese.

Everything else really doesn't matter-  I mean, the service is decent, the crowd is good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd come back for the food in a heartbeat, maybe next time i'll snuggle up with the cat."}
{"text":"The vig is the shit and I have yet to meet anyone who disagrees!  Very hip and chill!!"}
{"text":"The Vig is a great place to meet up for a drink. I haven't found too many other places that serve Hoegaarden (my favorite beer). The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, and the food is pretty good as well. I'd recommend the \"Big Azz Burger\" or the \"Hot Vings\"!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5
Service 1/5

Had the grilled chicken sandwich. I enjoyed it. It took about 45 mins to arrive, and when it arrived it came with cheese and without peppers. I had originally asked for peppers without the cheese. 

They refused to split our check, but they split the check of the table across from us. My guess is because they wanted the automatic gratuity of our table."}
{"text":"So delicious and amazing! The food is great, the atmosphere is great, the music is great, everything is great! I recommend the tacos, ahi salad, black bean burger, pozole, and hummus. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I love the place. Playing corn hole outside is always fun. It's dark and has a cool atmosphere. I love the pad Thai. I get it every time"}
{"text":"I LOVE The Vig!!!  I think I have been here probably 50+ times and have yet to be disappointed. My go-to is the french dip or mac and cheese and a jack and coke. Classic.  The patio is my absolute favorite! Corn hole+a beautifully lit tree+a random cat that always hangs around=my heaven.  

Crazy bonus? I met my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years here on my 23rd birthday!

Update: I married my boyfriend that I met for
the very first time at the Vig! #thanksvig"}
{"text":"Mac & Cheese $11: It was a good size portion. Not bad, not super amazing either. 

Ramblin' Rose $10: I tend to choose drinks by how girly the name sounds. This was tasty and right up my alley."}
{"text":"The carne asada potato pancake was great! I haven't tried anything else, but I loved what I got. My only complaint would be that I wanted more! That was probably just my greed talking though."}
{"text":"I've been to the Vig several times, usually always at night. I'm giving it 3 stars, because I keep going back for the strawberry bbq wings, but as far as service goes this place is hysterical. The staff arn't rude they're just missing. We came in about 40 min before closing time one night and were completely ignored by every waiter who walked by, We ended up repeatedly walking to the bar for drinks and to inquire about our food, bc no one would wait on us. My favorite experience was when a fellow co-worker and I went to buy a bottle of wine at 11:45 on a Sunday night. We thought they closed at 2am (which is posted on the door). The waitress allowed us to buy the bottle of wine, corked it, poured us glasses, and then told us they were closing at 12 because they were slow!? Who does that?! She then brought me the check and told me I could take it with me?! Another time I opted to buy the Vig Rig guy a drink on my tab as my tip and discovered he had put 15$ drink on my tab. Yeah, that one's my fault, but I still think it was super tacky and unprofessional. So yeah, good wings, good late night menu, but the kind of service that is actually funny-bad."}
{"text":"This is NOT a good venue for large groups.  The largest table is in the part of the patio that has no misters on it.  I'm not sure if everyone else had this problem, but it was disgusting how many flies came to eat when the food came.  We even asked if we can rearrange some tables at the side of the lounge area (empty at the time) that would've been perfect for our group and they wouldn't let us.  All the tables inside are small booths of pretty much the same size.

Definitely NOT the place to have your party in the summer!  They don't even fill your glasses with ice water regularly."}
{"text":"R.U. Kidding me. Went to The Vig last night before a 8:00pm show within walking distance to the restaurant. Arrived shortly after 6:00pm. We were told we would have 45-60 min wait. We were seated 60 minutes later even though throughout our wait time we saw multiple tables empty and wait staff rolling silverware or on their cell phones by the indoor bar. We looked at the menu while we waited and so as soon as we were seated we ordered....fish tacos and a chicken sandwich. 45 minutes later we still had not received our food. When we asked the waitress what was taking so long and explained that we had 8pm start time for a show we were attending.  She apologized for the long wait time and told us that some of her other tables were also waiting for their food and also had a 8pm deadline.  She left us saying she would check with the kitchen. She came back and informed us that our \"ticket\" was still 2 to 3 tickets from being next in line and that the kitchen was backed up because there had been large parties there that evening.  This is a classic example of their problem became our problem.   Two hours after having arrived at The Vig for a nice dinner out...we left without having eaten. MY ADVISE DON'T EAT AT THE VIG before any type of show downtown. There are many places downtown that better manage their kitchen, waitstaff and seating system and where you  can actually get the service and product they are supposed to be in business to provide."}
{"text":"The following is an open letter to the Jon Favreau lookalike DB at The Vig on Saturday:

Jon, 

What about me sitting quietly, enjoying a glass of wine with my girlfriend led you to believe that I wanted to do shots with you from a beer bong that you fashioned from a plastic pink flamingo. 
No really, what was it.... maybe I need a makeover. 

Full of piss and vinegar yet respectfully yours,

Kristi

(I will never go here without a boy in tow again)  I still love you Vig!"}
{"text":"Ok...you'd think by all the hype about this place it would be good.  Eh...not so much.   If you're looking to drink...this place rocks.  If your looking to eat..STAY AWAY.  The food here is half-rate at best.  They bar and physical building is pretty cool and hip.  But, if I want to go to a bar, there are so many other places to go.  If they got their menu and kitchen staff up to par, this COULD be an excellent place.  PLEASE FIRE YOUR CHEF and get a new menu ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"I met my husband three years ago on the patio for Sunday Funday so I had to rate The Vig a \"5\". We met with Elvis Before Noon  playing in the background (the Sunday band that plays ever week) so hired them to play at our wedding. Needless to say, this place is special to us. 
I really like the food here although my husband doesn't - not sure why. I love the grilled veggie sandwich and hummus. Once he had the special, ahi tacos, which he said was the best he's ever had, but they haven't had it again! 
Food is good, great patio, awesome drink specials, and fantastic music! What else can you ask for? To meet a man? Well, you can do that too!
;-)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty unassuming little building but definitely worth the visit. Driving up they have complimentary valet and they accept Venmo for tips which is a nice touch. We got seated right away and had Britt as our server. She was one of the highlights of our trip-so competent and really knowledgeable about the menu. 

We had the guacamole and salsa to start-both very spicy but really creamy and delicious. I had the Steak Melt and sweet potato fries which was so yummy but so rich it was hard to finish. One of my lunch partners had the Best Turkey sandwich which she described as delicious thanksgiving leftovers but unfortunately her pretzel bun was a bit stale. Another friend had the steak salad which she had only impeccable things to say. 

All in all a good experience and I will be back"}
{"text":"Yum!  We met a couple friends at the Vig for their new Monday $5 burger and fries special - what a steal!  Add that to great happy hour specials and you've got a night out on a budget!

I started with the lemonade while everyone else had a beer, and my husband was happy to see the Dogfish 90 minute on the menu. 

For dinner, I went with the greek salad with a side of sweet potato fries (of course!).  The greek salad was huge and came with some pita bread, so this was definitely a great choice for an entree.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but I was not a fan of the yellow dipping sauce they came with.  What even was that?  No one could figure it out.  The boys loved their burgers and fries.  Definitely big portions!  

Our service was so-so, but nobody seemed to mind.  It allowed us plenty of time to chat and just relax, which was nice.  

I wish there were more choices like this in Chandler!  Until then, we'll definitely take the trek back to the Vig, especially when it gets cooler and we can take advantage of the patio."}
{"text":"Went to The Vig last night with a couple of girlfriends.  Parking, plan on Valet cause that's the only thing available.  We got our own car without them bringing it to us since it was 12 feet away so that was $3 that I wish I was not forced to spend.  No idea if there is self parking anywhere else. 
We sat in one of the long booths on the patio. We were greeted by Meow Meow, The Vig's resident cat. Well, my friend and I are crazy cat ladies so we just loved that. 
The menu, looked amazing. I will have to go back many times to order everything I wanted.  I could not hold back from ordering their Mac and Cheese. Got it with bacon and chicken.  I'm so glad I got it.  This Mac and Cheese was very good. The portion was huge so I was more than happy to take the rest home with me.  
Looking forward to going back and playing corn hole. 
My review would be a 5 star had it not been for the parking."}
{"text":"Been to a few of The Vig locations and by far the best service ! On top of the fact that they play live music hold on ( gets better) ... they have a 6$ BURGERS ON MONDAYS !!!! 
Can't beat that awesome deal coming from a upscale neighborhood restaurant with lawn games and amazing happy hour drinks as well ! 
The menu is very unique and limited options but Everything is just so delicious. Including their brunch menu . definitely Can't  never  for wrong with their Mac & cheese ! If your looking for fun friendly upscale environment with a option of a patio and maybe some live music you are headed just the right direction!"}
{"text":"The Vig has amazing food and provides excellent service! Love the blackened fish tacos ! Yummy avocado/tomatillo salsa!"}
{"text":"I had an earlier review of this place's performance at lunch which had a higher rating. Last night, however, took the cake. There was a horrible, really awful, stench out on the back deck of The Vig. It smelled like an entire family of rats had died underneath our table. It was the smell of death, or of a really dirty restaurant. It wasn't pleasant. Unfortunately, it started up as we were halfway into our meal. 

I know that the patio of The Vig is a popular hangout, so I am actually baffled as to what's wrong with manager Pam and others in management who hear about this from customers and yet don't do anything? They say \"It's not our fault. It's the restaurant next door, with stinky dumpsters.\" As is true in the rest of your life, making excuses doesn't help. The only thing that would help is the complete elimination of the odor. Others were going inside the restaurant to eat. We stayed and finished our meal -- only later were we surprised no one had offered to move us inside as well. My guess is that if they had, about ten tables would have volunteered to move -- and they couldn't fit everyone inside if that was the case. 

I wrote a note on my check hoping someone would take pity on us and offer a free drink or something for my next visit. But no . . . Not even a call to management the next day resolved this. \"Not our problem\" was the response.

Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I went to The Vig for the first time last weekend and was impressed. Food is great and the drinks are delish! It'd be a great place to go on a date or to take visiting guests while they're visiting az. I'll be going back for sure! Great experience and good service."}
{"text":"I seated myself at 10pm Saturday and was served immediately.  I asked about wines and she went away briefly and came back with a plastic menu then left.  After waiting 5 minutes I realized I couldn't stay any longer unless I wanted my head to explode from the overbearing music.  I am too old for a frat/sorority environment.  It must be different other times from what I see in the reviews."}
{"text":"Start with the good; George of the Vig Rig will take you home for free (tip) if you are within range. Menu is fun. As I hadn't been here for a while   ( a year?!), the menu was refreshing plus daring. Speaking of risk, I ordered a Vigaz burger with sweet potato fries. Hamburger was prepared to order yet bun could use improvement. Would locally baked rolls hold up better? Fries were perfect with a tasty peppery Russian dressing.

So eats are decent.  However the bartenders could SMILE. Ok, I'm old 
school plus bartended thru college.  We smiled and made small talk with 
folks who were not gabbing in groups. Point: when I  saw a to go order, I 
wished this had been my choice. Kinda unusual that the friendliest guy is 
the valet ( who you pay $4 with tip.) Please work on the PR."}
{"text":"Delicious, decadent, fun! 

This place is for everyone at night, casual to high heels. They are open late late LATE for night time snacking, so that rocks! 

Cheesy tater tots to start were amazing. The Moscow Mules were to die for.  Pad Thai was super delicious and SO HUGE it took a whole box to get it home. The macaroni and cheese is fully customizable, so bacon. 

There are lots of different places to sit inside and outside, so I imagine that every experience is new and fun with the change in ambiance. The fire pits looked inviting on a cold night."}
{"text":"Tres leches French toast! Ridículos!  Titos  vodka bloody Mary bar for 4 bucks! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I came here for dinner again.  On a busy Saturday night with a party of 8 mind you.  The place was packed and it took about 30-45 mins to get tables.  While we were waiting I had a martini and it was just ok.  They don't have blue cheese olives and there were ice chips in the glass so it was like drinking a vodka slushi.  I should have just stuck with beer.

We had the hummus platter thing to start and it was pretty good though a bit salty.  This pitas were 'eh.  I ordered a side salad and it was just eh' as well.  Also, once again because I forgot to say something, our sweet potato fries came out before our meals.  WTF?!?  They are pretty good and not too greasy but their dipping sauce is still weird.

For an entree I ordered the VigAssBurger and it was very good.  I would order it again.  The burger was freshly made and cooked perfectly with tons of juicy flavor.

Somehow they have the food out super fast here which is awesome.  Our waitress was also very speedy and friendly which is very odd for a very busy night.  So yay Vig for those pluses. 

I just wish I lived closer because this is a super cool place to come and drink, especially outside.  I could lounge there for hours.  I just don't want to come back for dinner because this really is more of a drinking/light-eating establishment."}
{"text":"This is a great \"scene\" but the food was not that great... I had the filet and it was not  very tender and didnt have great flavor... but the wings were great... I think the apps are better than the dinner menu!  
The patio rocks!!"}
{"text":"This was REALLY good.  We stopped by for Friday Happy Hour.  We scored seats right next to the outdoor fireplace, enjoyed a few dirty martinis, the amazing hummus (spicy and garlic) as well as the awesome queso dip.  It was a really fun right and everything from the location to the service to the food was great.  I would definitely go again and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"AH The VIG!!
Great for drinks, for lunch, for lounging and talking on the patio and having a bite to eat. The patio area is very inviting and comfortable.
The interior is pleasing modern decor with great ligthing to set the mood.
BUT I CAN NEVER GET A PARKING SPOT HERE! and I am not a valet kinda gal.
(I was told they are opening another downtown location - so mayvbe they will rethink this)"}
{"text":"The Vig is my 'go to' place when hanging near my home in the area. No other bar has peaked my interest and kept my attention the way The Vig has here. Love the Mondays, when burgers are $5. Love Sunday Funday's at The Vig. Get there before your Saturday night hangover starts really making you feel hung and get your 'hair of the dog' sangria, mimosa or bloody mary on the patio while you enjoy the up tempo of live music. The bar is happening too for watching games and cool, friendly bartenders. Sundays are cheaper wine by the bottle days too. Pet the cat that hangs on the patio. He's not annoying. He likes to say hi and hopes that you will drop a snack for him. Bocce ball on the patio. I find the wine a little less pricey at Postino, if your comparing a watermelon to a grape. But this is still my fav, all around go-to place. Valet is pretty much the only way here. Now The Vig has even comandeered the parking lot across the way for $ too on valet. Not to keen on that idea. But not enough to make me rate them any less or keep me away. LOVE the firepit outside in the winter."}
{"text":"We were working an 18 work day at the booth at fashion week and hasn't eaten since lunchtime. By the time we got to The Vig it was 11:45pm and they were closing in 15 minutes.
When they told us they would serve us we ran ourselves in. Not only is the atmosphere here really cool, but they were super nice to us. Great music and each and every one of us loved our food and had no complaints. 
Definitely a lifesaver and a cool place to hang out and eat good lounge food."}
{"text":"So I don't live in Phoenix so I can't really comment on the contrast between this place and some other ones.  Though I have been to Postino and I do like it there quite a bit (see my other review). 
The first time I went to this place was in mid-summer.  It was on 4th of July weekend and it wasn't too crowded, we sat outside under a mister which somewhat cooled the dreadful heat.  I had a good time, it wasn't crowded, the design is cool.
The second time was this past weekend, probably the busiest time of the year, Thankgiving weekend.  The place was SUPER packed.  We got a table, right next to the door, which meant every time it opened or was held open I was freezing.  It just seemed like your typical go there to be seen type of thing.  I was wearing my clothes from the day, tee shirt, and jeans.  All the other girls there were wearing skimpy cocktail dresses!  The atmosphere that the architecture portrays is more laid pack and hang out, but the clientele gives me the feeling of snotty and rude.
I've never eaten here and I've only seen someone else eat the grilled cheese.  I didn't think it looked too great, there was like an inch thick piece of bread on either side of 3 half melted pieces of cheddar.  The fries were very skinny and looked pretty good...of course I'll eat anything that may involve ketchup so I'm not sure that says much and I didn't actually try them.
If I lived in Phoenix I most likely wouldn't be frequenting this place unless maybe it was an off night and I could just hang out in a sweatshirt."}
{"text":"Douching is a mystery to me. I mean, what is it? How does it work? Would I like to help a woman do it? Would I want to associate with a woman who does it? Do all women do it? Is there a root cause? Is there a special syrup?

So I looked it up:

A douche is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself. Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the vagina, but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A douche bag is a piece of equipment for douching - a bag for holding the fluid used in douching.

Now, to me, this sounds like a remarkable invention. But it's recently entered the moderm American lexicon as an insult typically directed at people like me. 

Yep, I said it. I know many of you think I'm douchy. What you don't know is that I always wear a condom, so introducing a stream of fluid into the vagina for medical or hygienic reasons is just not something to which I aspire.

So who are these real-life douchers? I'll tell you. It's so easy.

It's the people who stand between the bar and the line of booths at the Vig. They're in the walkway, completely oblivious to everyone trying to make it from the bathroom to the patio and back. You, my friend, are a douche bag. 

That said, everything else about the Vig is rad. It continues to be my favorite bar. The staff knows my drink. Love the patio. Best people watching in town. Sundays are so fun with the Daylons or whatever they're called. The music is always good, live or otherwise. The food has improved dramatically since my first review. Pam, the GM, is awesome.  I'm just a really, really big fan."}
{"text":"I visited the Vig last Monday and had the Best Turkey Sandwich with sweet potato fries. I don't know that it was the BEST turkey sandwich I've ever had, but it was definitely up there. :) The outdoor patio was also very cute and comfortable."}
{"text":"Bar atmosphere is fabulous! Outside patio is worth the visit alone. Sweet potato fries are great. Had the steak for dinner -- tasted like they had someone new grilling steaks on the BBQ tonight. Ordered it medium. Came out that way but tasted like a charcoal grill. The fries were not cooked (apps were just fine). The broccoli tasted like a charcoal grill as well. I will be back but not likely for dinner. Drinks outside!! Yes please."}
{"text":"I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it."}
{"text":"I used to love The Vig, but the new staff is sub-par. I used to frequent this place. The staff new me and my coworkers and we're so friendly and always took the best care of us, which is why we continued to come back, and would always tip well over the 20%.

The waitress we had was attentive and kept our drinks full, however the rest of the staff didn't care to even acknowledge us. When my burger was dropped I said, \"could I please get a side of ranch if it's not too much trouble.\". After about 10 minutes, peaked inside to see the guy who dropped off our food just chatting with a server at the terminal. Another guy was bussing the table behind us, had just started gathering plates, when I asked again, \"hey would you mind grabbing me a side of ranch\". He told me \"your server will be around in a minute or two.\" As a server myself, I would assume a guest's request would be more important, or take whatever is in your hands in and possibly grab that side for me. Not trying to be a burden, just would like to enjoy my fries while they are hot.

Our server came by, and promptly grabbed a side for my friend and I, pretty much saving the day. 
I then ordered a burger to go, asked for it on a leaf. Got home, and it was on a bun. It was for my mom, She can't have gluten. She can't even eat it. Super Disappointed.

Probably won't be coming back in unless Paul, Junior, Ricky or Ryan are there."}
{"text":"If your out cougar hunting and coming up empty, go to The Vig. Its like a scene out of National Geographics. I've definently had my fair share of kills here, but thats not why I go. Just like Georgeanne says below, I live extremely close. Roughly 30 seconds closer then her and my walking stride might be longer so I'd say about 7 minutes walking and 6 power walking. I am a MASSIVE fan of getting drunk and not having to drive home. Whether its cabbing it, hitch hiking, or walking, I will not get a DUI. The food here is slightly above great and below \"drop your pant and put yourself in it' amazing. The beer selection is good, not great, but they rotate drafts quite often which is nice. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. I think I've hit on the hot manager nearly everytime I've been in and still cant remember her name. The patio is the shit! Its larger then the inside part and it has botchiball. Drinking+botchiball=funny Kodak moments!"}
{"text":"Love the Vig.  We usually go the one off of Roosevelt Street, or wherever it is in the Avenues downtown and love the outside bar with the gorgeous skyline view.  I tried the one off of 16th Street and of course it didn't disappoint.  Had specials on Tito's for $4 for the summer, which definitely helps cool down the 100+ temps.  Food great as always and they have a cool \"outside\" atrium like place where there are nice lounge couches and people are throwing those bean bag things.  Cool atmosphere, great service and a great experience.  PLUS, if you are part of the Delta Skymiles Dining Club, you get miles for every $$ spent.  Woohoo!! $4 a drink to our first class upgrade!!!  Have fun!!"}
{"text":"friendly staff!
$3 coffee, nothing special. (go to Starbucks instead)
pretty empty for brunch on a Sat am
Monte cristo was a nice balance of sweet and savoury. the French toast' texture = on point
waitress recommended the hanger help over a few other savoury options... came out barely room temperature and bland. I doused it with cholula hot sauce and managed to finish half the plate. 
beware of the flies if you sit outside!"}
{"text":"Finally got to do Sunday Funday at The Vig. Holy moly. Place was PACKED to the gills. I live way up north and rarely venture out on Sundays so it was nice to see a place bustling like The Vig. I also found the crowd to be a refreshing change from what one might find up here roaming around City North and Desert Ridge. 

I went with a big group of friends. We all enjoyed the scene on the patio, live music, fun people. Drinks were OK, not the strongest in the world, but that might not have been too bad since we were there for 7 hours. 

Around 8, we finally got a table outside and had some dinner, which tasted great to me, but we had been drinking for several hours. I loved the Queso Fundido. My friend and I enjoyed it so much that we got a second round. By that time in the night, anything with melted cheese and chips sounded like heaven.

The rest of our friends got sliders, chicken sanwiches and the tandoori flatbread. All of those were well received. I think the flat bread went over the best.

The only thing that SUCKED was that someone stole my iPhone 3GS off the table as we were leaving. Next time I'll keep that at home."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always had a great experience.  The decor is very modern and trendy.  I've had a few of the salads, all of which were delicious.  The menu is pretty solid, overall, and the bloody marys are wicked good! A perfect place for a happy hour or lunch."}
{"text":"Ok.

I had the guacamole, and the salmon with corn chorizo stuff
OMG
I loved loved loved the food!

Get the salmon entree, seriously.  I thought it was superb.  Delicious.  I could eat it everyday.

The inside part was kinda loud, kinda crowded, a bit irritating.  The patio looked nice, but it was way to hot to enjoy.

I'll come back for the salmon.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Came here once before but tonight was my first time on the patio. The patio is a great atmosphere with fun music playing, comfort seating and misters everywhere (except for our seat!). I asked the hostess if it was too hot to sit out there, she said no and then seated us away from the misters. We were HOT! Only downfall but should be expected in August.

I ordered the Ahi tuna salad which was good, last time I had the Lean & Green steak salad and would highly recommend this one. My friend had the market fish, similar to mahi mahi and absolutely loved it.

Randomly coming on a Tuesday night, we ran into the Tuesday special. A bottle of wine and an appetizer for $22! Can't beat that one! Overall, this is a great place for hangout, dating, brunchin' and always good food! They tend to keep the lighting very low but would prefer some additional lights or extra candles!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fantastic patio. Tasty menu and last but not least half priced bottles of wine on Sunday. One of my favorite hangouts."}
{"text":"Found this place after a very long day of traveling, and glad we did! Food and service was excellent. Highlight was the short rib tacos - they are a must try. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been going to The Vig for years. I have always enjoyed this business. It's great food, good drinks, enjoyable atmosphere, and wonderful people watching. This past Tuesday I attended the Craft Beer dinner with friends. The dinner is three courses paired with a craft beer. The chef comes out and discusses the course with each table and the hostess educates us about each beer. It only takes place at the end of the month and you have to make a reservation by sending an email to pvincent@thevig.us. Its a great experience. Well this past time the menu featured a club sandwich and pork ribs. I am not a pork eater and when the chef came around I asked if the bacon could be removed from my sandwich because of it. He said sure no problem and I have a special surprise for you. I was just happy with the no bacon in my sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised when I received chicken drums in instead of ribs. It was above and beyond what I expected. I really appreciated it. If  you get a chance stop by, the food is always good and go to a Craft Beer dinner! Great place."}
{"text":"Ok, so let me start by saying that I have been to The Vig before and had a great experience! On my first visit I had the Vigazz Burger which I raved about to many as one of the best burgers I had ever had. cooked perfectly and the accompaniments set it off as a standout. 
Lastnight, not so much. It started with a good time at the bar while we waited for a table outside. We expected to wait a bit as the weather was so beautiful. However after 40 minutes and no update we decided we would take inside or out. I might add the only hostess in the building was not being assisted in any way with info. We saw her have to leave the front door to go looking for open tables many times leaving ungreeted guests. She was very nice and professional so I can't hold The Vig's staffing decisions during, \" In Season\" against her.
Once we were seated It was very windy due to the dampeners on the vents being wide open and pointing straight down on the table. We were promptly and courteously moved to another table by the hostess. Keep in mind that a simple adjustment after closing will keep further guests from complaining. It wasn't the AC as much as the velocity. 
This is where it goes down hill. Our server was overwhelmed, maybe another example of poor staffing. We ordered an appetizer as soon as we sat as we already had drinks. The smoked Salmon was great but you wouldn't know that because we were never checked on until it was cleared away. Also this means our dinner order was not taken until well after we had finished apps. Our fairly early dinner is now going on two hours without even ordering dinner yet. We both ordered and a temp was asked for on the burger. I ordered medium, needless to say it was well done and without the grilled onions and gruyere cheese would have been tasteless. I also asked for no bacon which I had to remove. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted another drink during our meal and when she did her check about how the food was we hadn't even started. I rarely review and only in an instance where something is truly standout in direct contradiction to it's reputation or my own past personal experience would I write a negative one. Our server, \"Glow\" indicated on check was inattentive and lacked service skills even taking into consideration the lack of staffing. Knowing when to ask for help is being a professional. In addition I'd like to add that no matter what a company's policy is on hair I think it's gross to wear your long flowing hair down while waiting tables. It may not be a county health policy as many like to state but it is an industry known practice to keep your hair tied up in some fashion.  
We will hope for a better experience next time because we do love the Vig and the Patio."}
{"text":"I love the vig and the laidback but highclass atmosphere they present there. The breakfast in manhattan martini doesn't play around, it has woodford reserve bourbon shaken with fresh apple juice and syrup! It has shredded bacon lining the rim of this intoxicating drink. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because I ordered my steak Med-Rare and it came out Medium and even more dry than a medium should be."}
{"text":"It was a warm sunny Sunday, and with out of town friends in tow, I chose The Vig. Having never been there it was chosen solely by reputation and lots of good word of mouth. We also wanted someplace to enjoy with a patio. We self parked and were quickly greeted by the valet who wanted the keys and offered a ticket, that's fine, and he was very polite. 
Upon entering My first impression was great, they offered a 45 minute wait for a table, that didn't seem to bad, as the Vig had a great Vibe. The live band on the patio mid day Sunday was a nice touch, and something not seen most places. 
The host suggested our large group take the corner of the bar as she was about to seat the girls sitting there. That also was a nice touch. The ambiance was great and the lively atmosphere kind put me at ease and in the party mode at the same time.
The First snag came with the party mode because bar service was sluggish at best, and I cant stand to wait for a drink or compete with the regulars and hot chicks for drinks. Thankfully after the regulars and hot chicks got there drinks we were served. We all wanted margaritas and wine, and come to find out both were on special. NICE and worth the wait !!!.
Once seated in a tight booth by the door we ordered appetizers and lots of them, most were good, but the tandoori flat-bread was stellar an easy 10, but the sliders hovered near a 5 on a ten point scale. I wasn't fast enough for a taco but heard they were great.
Why have I waited so long to get to The Vig? I have no Idea, but it will only be a week before I return."}
{"text":"The Arcadia location of The Vig is awesome. Inside is very boisterous but you can still carry a conversation with your friends at your table. The outdoor patio feels like someone's really nice backyard, it's always a fun time out there.

I've had nearly everything on the menu. My favorite items are the nachos with carnitas and the pozole. The pozole is out of this world, it's one of the best I've had in a long time. The Vig is my go to spot when I want a good meal, with a good vibe and I don't want to spend an arm an a leg.

One thing that is a bummer is that some of their locations use Nowait and others do not (at least they have in the past). The Nowait feature was an amazing option to get on the list without having to wait up front where there is limited seating."}
{"text":"I just do not understand the appeal.... a bunch of basic white yuppies congrating and overcrowding a cramped location. 

The live music: Overly loud bland grundge hits from the 90's... BORING
(and they play non stop!!)

The food - barely average and over priced

No where to sit.....

They allow to alley cats to reside there but allow no dogs on the patio"}
{"text":"Won't be back. My order took about 25 min to come out, but that wasn't the real issue. I paid cash for the order. The server rounded up and didn't bring my change. She rounded in the restaurants favor!!! I understand it was only 19 cents, but this is wrong! Think about every person they do this for."}
{"text":"Boo!! Three strikes you're out !! This is the third time I've gone to The Vig and the third (and last time) I've gotten horrible service and served mediocre food."}
{"text":"First time at this Vig. Much smaller than the Vig Uptown, but a very nice closed in patio. You can hardly hear the traffic on 40th st. We were there for happy hour $1.50 off most drafts and bottled beer and some drink specials. Good deal on some appetizers. We tried the wings and they were just average. They could use a few more options on the sauces. My biggest beef is the lack of a craft beer selection. Very weak, unlike the Uptown Vig which has many more options on tap."}
{"text":"The Vig's getting upped to 5 stars. I seriously don't really know what I was thinking with the 4 stars.  I think I maybe thought it was a tad overpriced and I'm not a fan of M-F happy hours that end at 6, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is all AMAZING and the Sunday Specials make up for the Happy Hour thing.  

The staff is great. I lost my phone there yesterday and felt really bad bugging the busy bartender to ask if one had been turned in, but he was super nice about it. My friend found it under an umbrella stand though. Thanks for asking, I know you were really concerned. Our waiter was also awesome and the manager helped us relocate after this random dude who reminded me of the guy from Mask (the Cher one, not the Jim Carrey one. That would have been awesome.) sat down at our amazing Bocce Ball table and WOULD NOT LEAVE. It was seriously ridiculous.  At least buy a round of drinks if you're going to bogard our table, Ginger!  But I digress.

The smoked salmon appetizer, the deconstructed fish tacos, and the Thai vings are my fav menu items. But I haven't had everything so that's not to say other items aren't equally amazing, because I'm sure they are.  

Honestly guys, I think I'm still drunk from being there yesterday. Normally when that happens I hate everyone and everything, but I still love the Vig today.  5 EFFING STARS."}
{"text":"Hellooooo delicious!
The price to quality radio was great during our brunch the other weekend.
I ordered the chicken enchiladas for brunch, with a mimosa.
My friends ordered a Croquet Monsieur, biscuits and gravy, and chips n guac.

We all agreed that the food was satiating and not too heavy. We were energized and our plates were empty by the end, as opposed to leaving leftovers or feeling too full after.

The atmosphere was great, the food was at a great ratio, and we enjoyed the live music in the patio Saturday morning. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"The Vig was just okay in my opinion.   I met some friends there for happy hour  on a Friday evening and it was packed.   We did get the drinks/app specials, and all the food we tried was just okay.  The atmosphere was your standard trendy bar/meat market. (i.e. A lot of people trying waaaay to hard to look and act cool.)  We had a good time, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back there anytime soon. The people I was with we're great, but The Vig  itself was 'meh'...certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"The Vig is a happening place it seems... The outdoor back patio ROCKS, I mean it almost makes me regret quitting smoking because that place is a dream for a smoker lol...

Good drinks... Here's how I know this, I order a Greyhound (best drink ever imo) and the dude busts out freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, that makes such a difference, and it did not go unnoticed... 

What I think, is that the Vig owners need to open up a new North Scottsdale location, bet you it would go over well up here and the nightlife is dwindling... Plus that side of Arcadia is a trek, even from old town scene... 

Also, what is this I hear about the Vig bus? Apparently you can call and they will come and pick you up/drop you off (within reason)? That's pretty f-ing cool if you ask me..."}
{"text":"Love this place good food stiff drinks the service isn't always the best they seem to have to many tables or not be really into talking to there tables... but I think it's because there used to regulars so my first time here was weird. I was waiting for her to go over the menu or specials but it just didn't happen. Haha."}
{"text":"I live on the same block as the vig. Works out perfectly for late night food or drinks. Food can be a bit off every once in awhile, but usually comes out well. Some of the waitresses can be a bit snobby or hardly come to the table. I will commend the bartender with the full on man bun. He's super nice and has waited on us a couple times and always does an excellent job. Over all, the Vig is a great place. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it."}
{"text":"Why did I have such a good time here, again? Was it because I was with the best of company & just couldn't go wrong? Vig sure does make my date nights go well though, I'll say that much.

Friday after 11. I wore black flats, not my checkered vans. The door guy didn't say squat about liking my shoes. So I'm pretty sure he doesn't say that to all the girls. That made me like him even more. I think he genuinely likes my vans.

Hmm not always easy to find a seat. The host is gone & it's \"seat yourself\".

Made it to the back bar. Got a couple drinks. I was being leered at by 2 guys pushing 60. Uncomfortable, so we moved.

We got a table & 2 different servers asked us if we'd been helped. We moved tables. No server. We sat in some chairs. No server. Meh...

Also, Meow-meow might be preggers. She looked a little on the fat side."}
{"text":"By far...the absolute best place to be on a Sunday. Yes, it does get busy, especially if you go right at peak hours. Unfortunately, I work early on Mondays now so I can't par take in the festivities quite as much, but as far as a place to do some day drinking and enjoy AZ weather on the patio, it is golden. The half price bottles of wine are key...my friends and I will go there and get a bottle of wine for $12!! And we get to listen to live music too! Also, the smoked salmon plate is super yummy with capers, rye toast points and cheese... MMMM. I also love the guacamole and salsa which is a great finger food for a group."}
{"text":"First off, I work in the industry so I may be a little more judgemental than most.... I haven't been here in a while and the only main attraction was to come see Elvis Before Noon play (amazing band BTW). Service was awful. I sat at my table for at least 15 min before the server noticed me. After we placed our drink and food order, she never checked back up on our table. We were done with both our food and drinks and had to flag down the host to even get our checks. I absolutely will not be back. With all the new bars opening up around the area, they probably should focus on their customer service."}
{"text":"I've now eaten at The Vig twice - once for Sunday lunch, and most recently, for dinner during a weeknight. I thoroughly enjoyed both my meals. 

The food is good and priced right, and the waitstaff is very friendly. While the place is definitely noisy at night, this didn't bother me. Perhaps this was because I was sipping The Vig's great Bloody Mary's throughout the meal, but I was fine with the noise. 

I've not yet eaten out on the patio, but plan to do so. And I hear the place has a pet cat. Definitely want to return for the cat - and the sweet potato fries. :)"}
{"text":"Patio patio patio!
It's spectacular! Great for group gatherings. I love their cocktails as well and they have an awesome Bloody Mary bar on Sunday's!

Some of the food is just bar food but I personally love the hot vings and their Mac and cheese is so buttery smooth. You definitely feel like you've put on a few pounds. Their full menu has a lot of good stuff on it but I'm usually here for happy hour.

They are always happening but never super crowded, when I've been anyways and you always feel like you're well taken care of. For happy hour rotations I'd reccommend the vig!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Vig several times for lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  It's  a good place to go for all there.  Good drinks, good food, and great outdoor seating.  Try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Was in PHX for work and one of my co workers took me there for lunch...all I can say I had the best turkey sandwich I have ever eaten... Too bad I wasn't around to enjoy Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The decor is sleek and modern and the food is pretty good too. The crowd is a little pretentious but very friendly. I always have a lot of fun here and it's my alternative to Scottsdale if I don't want to get all dressed up or if I want to do a Sunday Funday."}
{"text":"The Vig is home to one of my favorite hamburgers in Phoenix! The Vig Burger has all my favorites on one bun - cheese, fried egg, avocado, jalapeños and more! Can you say yum?

The atmosphere is awesome. They have an indoor-outdoor vibe and the patio is beautiful when the weather permits. 

Drinks can be expensive, but they have a great happy hour (Monday-Friday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.). I haven't had a signature cocktail I didn't like and the well drinks are only $4.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm such a sucker for a place like this. First of all, the aesthetic of the place basically mimics anything I would ask for style-wise. I love the oxidized steel and the sink in the women's bathroom...so great! 

Anyways, I really had a great time here. My partner and I went with another couple who recommended the spot. We got a little table right next to the Bocce Ball court which was fantastic.

I had two long islands which were both perfect strength and exactly what I wanted after a long week. To eat I ordered a chicken salad (i can never remember the names of all these salads...they start to run together) and shared my partner's 1/2 and 1/2 (french fries and sweet potato fries...yum!). It was excellent. Not anything out of this world or new or anything like that...but still really good. 

I was perpetually impressed by the music selection too. We walked in to some old school MJ and then ended up hearing Feist (and actually something besides 1, 2, 3, 4...), and Esthero. So I was happy. 

I had a really great time here. The only bummer was that trash smell, but I just read in Jason's review that Filiberto's is to blame for that one. Sad. But they threw on some nag champa and covered that right up and we were good to go.

So all in all, head to the Vig, sit outside, have a drink, play bocce ball and have fun!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We went on a weekend for lunch.  They had a live band out back which was amazing.

We ordered some appetizers to share and spent a few hours just relaxing and listening to the band outside.

Beautiful restaurant and nice area out back. Definitely a great place to hangout with friends and enjoy the outdoors.

I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you like to gamble, and by gamble I mean serious sports betting, then you're all too familiar with the term vig. (short for vigorish)
Which is why I've avoided this place for so long, the name simply repulsed me. 

No wait. 
It didn't repulse me. It dredged up bad (really bad) images of Super Bowl 36, where that piece of shit Tom Brady staged a last minute comeback, killing my point spread. 
This is about the time you learn what a vig is, and how much it means to a bookie.
Fuck. I digress, sorry.

The Vig is full of good looking people, so the ambiance gets high praise.
Food is well above average, try the Thai Chili Chicken Wings. 
Coors Banquet served in old fashioned 12 ounce bottles had me fantasizing I was a cattle rustler in the old west. 

Crowded on a Wednesday night, our crew sat on the patio. It was hot out and I got a bad case of swamp ass. Luckily, I carry a small ziplock of gold bond mentholated powder which resembles about $10,000 worth of coke. 
The guy in the men's room who saw me putting it on my butt thought I was crazy. I told him coke on your sack is quite the experience if you can afford it.  

After that, my ass felt like it was smoking Newports throughout dinner, enjoying my  Vig experience for the first time since Super Bowl 2002.

Anyway, I like this place and you probably will too. 
Wait till the weather cools off if you're going to sit on the patio, or else have some mentholated butt powder handy."}
{"text":"The Vig is a great place to eat/drink in Arcadia. I've been there for both adult gatherings, and have also taken my busy-body-five-year-old son. They have a variety of delicious gourmet food choices, an awesome selection of beers on tap, and a friendly, attentive wait staff! They have extremely generous portions for moderate prices. I would say that each of my visits is a good value for what I'm getting."}
{"text":"Cool place, Sunday afternoons are my favorite there."}
{"text":"Great central location for meeting up with friends all over the area.  Wonderful food and reasonable prices. The happy hour deals are particularly amazing.  Had 4 really delicious fish tacos that were as good as the best of places in California and they were $6.  
AMAZING cocktails!  The Whipped one, I forget the name, was the best drink I have had in a long time!  
Bartenders are really helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Delux introduced Phoenix to the super good gourmet burger and the Vig has successfully taken it to another level.  The Vig Azz is the burger that I think Dave Thomas and Ray Kroc probably eat up in heaven.  The other dishes are good as well.

The vibe is LA pretentious cool so just pretend to be hip when you get your super tasty burger."}
{"text":"This place will always have a special place in my heart because I met the love of my life here... our first date was amazing as well as all the times after that.

Picture this... you are wealthy, have a nice home, and you love to entertain... now picture the atmosphere you would want to ideally create... this is a replica of that...

You walk in the door and you're immediately taken by the ambiance you pictured in your head. The music is not overbearing but slightly loud enough to hear over the full conversations happening all around you. The bar is situated down the right side of the wall where behind it lies the kitchen that creates tasty dishes and small plates. To the left is a row of booths large enough to comfortably seat groups for a cozy fun time. As you make your way to the \"back\", you come upon a partially enclosed area that is made for hot weather (with shade and misters) as well as cold (with a fireplace situated in the middle of the secluded courtyard outside. Also in the middle of the patio rises up a large shading tree covered in small white lights to add to the cozy, romantic-esque scene.

As for the drinks, they are priced pretty fairly and the bartenders can make anything you can think up. Their wine list is moderate in price as well as products. If you feel the need to tantilize your tastebuds, their menu is not as healthy as I would like but it is damn tasty! The best thing on their entire menu is their signature bowl of Mac N Cheese. I always add bacon and broccoli. The bowl is large enough for two so I eat half there and take the rest home. What's even better about this place is that the kitchen stays open fairly late and they have decently varied HH prices and options.

All in all, this is a nice place that you wish you could call home. All they need now is a back room with a bed! LOL"}
{"text":"so we go to the vig for big azz $5 burger night. we show up all mad men amped and ordered 2 glenlevits. i take 2 drinks out of my beverage and notice a fly floating like a dead fish. i let the waitress know, she seemed concerned and brought me a comprable scotch since they were out of glenlevit. im not picky, i promise. i didnt like it, but i drank it. as soon as my friends ice melted in his drink, he noticed 2 floating friends in his. he showed the server his glass, who had a face of dsibelief, as if it was impossible that 2 people drinking the same scotch could both have dead flies in it. so he tried mine, didnt like. asked her to bring him something else. we finish our drinks and his vigazz burger, and get the check. loanbehold the check shows 1 scotch, 1 scoth that was $5 more than the other and a comment about how we didnt mention $5 burger night... even though the menu clearly states it. my friend doenst mind paying $ for good scotch. he does mind when he gets a replacemtn scotch that costs $5 more. flies happen on accident, but bad service doesnt."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  The food was great at a reasonable price and they were lots of beautiful people there.  Very relaxed upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Its a torn review.
I used uber eats to order the food. Of courses, there is food missing on the order. Uber calls the Vig, the Vig isn't helpful. So as the customer I'm screwed. Do not order delivery from them, you will not get your order correct! So whos fault is it? 

In terms if the food
Posole is really tasty, I enjoyed it. Next time I guess ill visit the establishment and hope for a better experience. Not to hopeful though...."}
{"text":"SOLID! The food is amazing! I have tried the fish tacos, little burgers, and turkey sandwich. Everything is fresh and flavorful! I love the atmosphere and the decor. My father, who is 60 years old, heard about this place at work and so I took my parents here. They loved it!!! The trivia questions (on the table) were PERFECT dinner fun!"}
{"text":"Good wings and burger deals! Their happy hour is decent and the edamame appetizer is bomb. 

Wine Sunday's are a treat, love the patio, friendly staff, and overall good service. My gripe would be their brunch menu at all the vigs - it's nothing decent, but that's nothing specific to this location. 

Minimal parking if you don't want to valet, which I never do, so ride your bike or bring cash to tip the valet peeps."}
{"text":"This is the only location I will go to. I live in chandler, so it is very far for me, but it is worth the drive. I love the atmosphere, crowd, drinks, and food. The patio, fireplace in the middle, and live bands make this place intertwining. Good place to socialize and grab happy hour. Good looking crowns of all ages."}
{"text":"Last time I really liked this place but we were here earlier, happy hour time.  I will go back for happy hour.  This time it was later, around 1130, and I was glad to see it was busy.  Sat at a booth and waited 10 minutes but no waitresses.  Went to the bar and couldn't get a drink, not that busy.  Went outside to back bar and they were completely nonresponsive.  If you want to be seen or are looking for a late night meat market then go.  Otherwise, stick to when the service exists earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great wine selection and good deals on Tuesday!  Cool atmosphere too.  Definitely one of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"First time eating dinner there.  Our table had the chips w/ guac and salsa.  Super app.  Followed by burger, hot chick, and veggie sandwiches.  All were great.  Good and attentive staff even though the place was packed."}
{"text":"On a whim, my girl pals and I chose the Vig as one of our happy hour stops.  We had a wonderful time.  It was hump day and the place got packed fast while we were there.  The ambiance is aesthetically pleasing and the vibe makes you feel all grown up.  And, I might add,  it's a great choice for first-dates.  Everyone's plate looked delish.  I envied everyone's choice.  The Vig has something for all palettes."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves here.  We ordered the cheese artichoke dip appetizer, hamburger and jerk chicken sandwich with fries and a couple drinks.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests.

Pros:
-relaxing upscale atmosphere
-great food
-good service
-the patio

Cons:
-parking"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great food and drinks. Love the music. Wednesday and Sundays are my favorite because they have live music."}
{"text":"I will not go to the Vig again. I understand Arizona Law allows minors to sit at the bar. But being in the business for nearly 20 years, every law enforcement officer I have encountered has encouraged against it stating and I quote \"impressions mean everything.\" Why would a business with nearly 200 seats in the dining room allow a minor to sit at one of the few seats at the bar and disrupt the adult atmosphere the bar is created for. I guess the Vig would rather sell a $3 Shirley Temple with free refills rather than a $10 Craft Cocktail they have taken so much effort to create with no free refills or a $16 glass of wine to adults wanting to have an adult experience. Check out the pictures attached. Either this minor sneaked sips from his father's drink or the water he was drinking made him sleepy. Either way, not my scene. I prefer to sit next to other adults my own age, not their kids. Shame on the parent and the Vig for allowing this."}
{"text":"Always a good time and the food isn't bad either. It's not the kind of place you should go with a big group, would be a tight squeeze, but with 4-5 people it's perfect! They have live bands on the weekends and the cats sit front row (Literally there are always like 4 kitties laying around and hangin with the crowd). I recommend the Vig!"}
{"text":"Not all Sundays but....this Sunday they had $3 Margaritas and wine bottles were 1/2 off!!! Seriously??? Lol oh you know I had like...a bunch of those margaritas!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to the Vig for ages.  i finally got to go on Friday, for a friend's birthday.  We ate elsewhere, then headed over to The Vig for drinks.  It's a beautiful place; atmosphere-wise it's got a great date ambiance.  It was close to 10 when we got there, so it was already pretty crowded, but we headed to the patio that was fairly empty due to the cold.  

It's even more lovely outside.  We huddled around a heater, and I was really absurdly impressed when a waitress came around and offered us blankets.  Very soft, puffy, lovey blankets that I wanted to steal.   Our waitress was pretty rude, though, and had an \"I'm way too cool for you\" attitude.  I typically don't blame the establishment for that, unless it's ongoing and constant every time I go.   So since it's my first visit, I won't take a star away just yet.

I had been told they had a wicked chocolate martini, so I ordered that.  It was frankly pretty grody.  But that's just a matter of personal taste, and I just won't order it again.  

The problem?  The crowd was soooo not my crowd.  It was all the shiny people from Scottsdale.  I really, really wanted to like it.  I still do.  I will give it a couple more tries, and I am curious how the food is.  

For a night out drinking, final destination-type place?  I'm just not feeling it.  But I bet it's ideal for a lazy day of day-drinking on the patio, once we get our lovely early spring weather."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Vig for a while now and decided it was finally time to write a review.  I love going there.  The food is always great, the patio is very cool, and the drink specials are good.  My only problem with the Vig is the bar inside is soooo loud.  If you can't get a seat outside on the patio it can be hard to talk to the person across from the table from you.  Minor complaint in an otherwise awesome bar though.  Definitely a recommendation for anybody looking to go out for a drink."}
{"text":"Alright folks. Let's not get carried away. When it comes to the whole \"I can't stand people with fake boobs and $300 sunglasses surrounded by hip decor\" thing, I stand with you. We are kindred spirit. That's not really my scene either and I can only tolerate it in small doses. But I don't believe in punishing an establishment that has worked hard to create a cool space for people to get together and have fun, just because of the social demographics of its crowd. Is the crowd really that important anyway, if you're there with your own group? 

The Vig is exactly what even its complainers concede in their reviews: a very cool, trendy, \"modern tavern\" with an urban theme to its decor. Outside it has a giant fireplace and plenty of heatlamps to go around (wintertalk here, obviously), as well as comfortable outdoor couches and comfie chairs for groups of people to sit, drink, and blab. The staff is very friendly. At one point we moved to the interior, because the two friends I was with (one from Canada, the other from Chicago; they should be ashamed) were \"too cold\" as it was getting windy out, and we enjoyed the inside too. 

The 3 of us were pretty entertained trying to figure out the crowd. Who are these people? They're not exactly the Scottsdale species (maricopus cosmeticimprovementus), though they appeared closely related. Definitely not Central Phoenix types (randomus emohippopotamus). Too old to be from ASU. The median age was probably 35 on the Friday night I was there. 30something douchebags galore. Investment bankers from the Biltmore area maybe? That was one of my friends' hypothesis. I thought it was a good one. But I also theorize that there is some element of the crowd that is influenced by the Vig's proximity to Paradise Valley, which is only 4 minutes away (for those who don't know, PV is Phx's residential answer to Beverly Hills; many celebrities who move here live in PV). Hollywoodus donchawannabelikeus?

So yeah, you might not fit in with this crowd but why should that stop you? By 7 or 8 o'clock, the Vig was completely hopping with good music and tons of people packed inside having fun, including us. We didn't try the food because the reviews seem to have torn that aspect to shreds. But the happy hour beers were 3 bucks each and appetizers were half off. What's wrong with that?

EDIT: One warning. The parking. Three bucks to valet, and I still have no idea where you would park for free to avoid that on a crowded night. Maybe across the street in the Basha's parking lot?"}
{"text":"My dish was good, my husband's was kinda bland. The music was way too loud, but it was nice they had valet. The staff was kind and professional. They were really on top of the water, and it didn't taste like strong AZ tap water. They were way busy, but you can call ahead to get on the list, so that's nice."}
{"text":"The Vig boasts one heck of a patio. Imagine sitting on an enclosed patio with friends, live music and twinkle lights. This is how it feels at The Vig. The Vig reminds me of a friend's home who has a great patio. It's easy to spend hours sitting on the patio and enjoying some good food and drinks. Plus on the weekends, you'll most likely enjoy live music as well! 

First of all, I love that they have freshly squeezed cocktails, including a delicious greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit! Their food here is delicious as well and I especially love their sandwiches and sweet potato fries. On a healthy day, I opt for the deconstructed fish taco which is fish and all the toppings that you can pick and choose to eat from. 

All in all, the reviews speak for themselves. The Valley could use more Vig's around town!"}
{"text":"The big is a great bar and hang out. A very social place. Every time I am there it's super crowded and everyone is having a great time. I've eaten here twice and the food is a notch above bar food - it's good and inventive with some dishes. They had some awesome tater-cheese things that I will order again. I would not bring a kid here, although I think I saw one during the day once. They have live music on the patio and the patio is huge. This is a good place for parties/meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"This has become the Sunday afternoon go-to hangout spot in Arcadia. I could be saying too much, because the Scottsdale douchebag crowd may catch on and disrupt our awesome neighborhood hangout. I LOVE spending my Sunday afternoons drinking a few beers here. The patio on Sundays is the place to be. Get there before 2:30 if you have any hopes of getting a table. After 3, the band, and thus the party gets underway, and it becomes a good time.

I've been coming here since before it was \"cool\" to be here. I've watched it slowly morph into a slightly confused too much to too many sort of place. It seems as though they don't know who, or what they are. The food, because of this crazy loss of direction has become \"eh\" quality. The menu is confusing, just in the read, then when you get this plate of confusion fusion, well, it just leaves too much on the plate. Again, I go back to the point that it is trying to be too much to too many. There are too many things going on in the dishes. Not in a bold, rich, dynamic, wow! sort of way, but in a \"HELP ME! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TASTING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON!\" sort of way. 

I suggest: Because I love the feel and vibe of this place. 
Settle down! Simplify the menu. Focus on making simple, flavorful and quality food.  This is a neighborhood bar, not a 5-star bistro. The Turkey sandwich is a perfect example of screwing up a fantastically simple, good eating, sandwich. The crab artichoke dip is hated by those who serve it, and incredibly bland to those who order and eat it. Take the simplicity of that dish, and figure out how to enhance the flavors in it. 

As far the service goes: I've had great service, and I've had abysmal service. Guess it's a hit and miss sort of thing. I will say that Scott is the best it gets there, and I make it a point to get into his section. Management has been rude to me on several occasions with a nose high attitude. I was asked to relinquish my table because my party hadn't shown up. Nothing that a polite, \"No. I will not.\" wouldn't fix, however. 

Bottom line here: If you're looking for a fun place to grab a beer or glass of wine, and maybe a burger, with a great vibe, and fun people, this is the place. If you're looking for really great food, and friendly, hospitable service, you might want to go there first, then come to The Vig after filling your belly. 3 Stars. Barely. Because of the band and great vibe on Sundays."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night after a concert while visiting from Orange County ca. Seated ourselves per the sign and were apprehensive because the outside appeared to make it look like a bar bar. We were pleasantly surprised! Great play list overhead, super charming patio, and easy laid back interior with a late night menu. The staff were attentive, not annoying, and super friendly. The burger and sliders were so tasty! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The Vig is one of those places where showing up on a Sunday afternoon will not only get you an insane $5 Bloody Mary, but also maybe even a spot on the patio. Housed along 40th Street just south of Indian School, The Vig is a neighborhood tavern offering up a casual yet modern atmosphere with great drinks and well priced eats. All of these perks have their downside, the parking. If you go early you can get a spot otherwise, it's pretty much valet only, so don't forget a few bucks for a tip.

Ask to be sat on the modish patio if you can, weather permitting. On my last visit the patio was vibrant with an attractive 30-something crowd. Once you're sat, the service is friendly and outgoing with well-paced timing between drinks and food.

The menu layout is fairly straightforward though all over the place in terms of style. Seems the chef is going for a broad appeal venturing from Greek to Italian with some Indian and Mexican influences thrown in. This tends to be a plus and a minus depending on your personal tastes.

A good example of this was the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken ($10). Topped with baby spinach, sun dried tomatoes, paneer cheese, pear-cardamom chutney on naan bread; the pizza was complex and delicious. The sweet flavor of the chutney and tomato was a nice contrast to the savory chicken, cheese and crust.

More of a straightforward choice was the Trifecta ($10). You get three perfectly cooked mini burgers draped with American cheese, grilled onions, pickles and spicy mayo, served with French fries. Classic Americana, you can never go wrong with burgers and fries.

I didn't really understand the take on the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake ($15). There are slices beautiful medium rare carne asada with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce, then they put it all atop a potato pancake. I guess I appreciate the creativity of the idea though it's not like you can pick it up and eat it like a taco. Believe me, this would have been wholeheartedly welcome since the potato pancake was waterlogged.

Another complete misfire was the Frenchy ($13). Their take on warm roast prime rib, pile it high on a gorgeous French roll then cover with fontina cheese and served with a side of au jus. Sounds like the perfect sandwich in theory, but to my disappointment, it was unsatisfying. Something went terribly wrong here since the meat was so perfectly cooked and tender, however it was completely void of flavor. The au jus echoed this, simply a cup of unseasoned beef stock. The only saving grace was the chewy French roll and the fontina; maybe a grilled cheese would have been better? The sweet potato fries that came with the sandwich had a perfectly crunchy exterior with a sweet and fluffy interior, some of the best I've had.

Even with a few food misses, the service, vibe and overall cool factor making The Vig a great place for a date or just to hang out."}
{"text":"I stopped by The Vig for lunch today with some friends and I had the Deconstructed Fish Tacos and wow!!! The dish was a perfect size and so tasty! My other lunch companions had the Tenderloin Sandwich and the Greek Salad. Both were very good. 

Dining at The Vig has always been pleasant so this trip wasn't much a a surprise. 

P.S. I'm still hoping they bring back the Grilled Romain Salad as it was awesome! 

Looking forward to my next trip to The Vig."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio to chill with friends and great food. Even when they're busy, the service is great. This was such a delicious dish-salmon salad tacos! I can't wait to get it again."}
{"text":"This place was blaring Counting Crows. I couldn't even stay for the drink I ordered. I ran, everybody, I RAN out."}
{"text":"I've been to The Vig many times for drinks but this is the first time that I decided to eat an entire meal at this place. I've been hearing about their $5 burger and fries special on Mondays so I made a dinner date with my girls and headed on over. Surprisingly we didn't have to wait for a table, even though their patio is the place to be it was a little too hot for all of that. 

My girls and I decided to go for the burgers of course! I ordered the Vigazz burger which came with arugula, Gouda cheese, bacon, sauteed onions and some sort of sauce on a pretzel bun. And since I'm obsessed with sweet potato fries I decided go for those instead of regular fries. I wasn't prepared for this gigantic burger and fries that was placed in front of me! It all looked AHmazing...and it tasted good too. I could only eat half of the burger and fries but took the rest home to have for lunch the next day. 

The service was so-so nothing bad but not spectacular...our server seemed a bit uncomfortable or nervous...maybe he's new?? 

Anyway very good deal for 5 bucks, I may have to make this my Monday night spot since I live so close :-)"}
{"text":"My new favorite place ever! I got the greek salad and mimosas (plural). who can beat a $5 mimosa?! Love this location and I plan to be back."}
{"text":"happy hour! they have a pretty darn good one. 1/2 off happy hour prices on their specific menu...we opted for the fish tacos....4 small tacos with a side of a rather spicy hot and delicious guacamole style sauce. excellent!

i had 2 kiltlifters at 2 bucks off the standard menu. the wife and her friend had 2 premium cocktails for the same price. there are plenty of options for food and drink and their happy hour prices are top notch. 

the place itself is very cool. we sat outside, and yes, it was a tad bit warm. it's all shaded and misted but it was still warm. no matter as the food and beverages cooled us down. 

service was good. our water glasses stayed completely filled the entire time and our server was prompt and courteous, without being overbearing. 

but valet...i swear, i could live my whole life and not ever use valet. i understand the concept when dealing with small parking lots where numerous people park and/or you can get ticketed for parking in another properties lot, but i hate it. especially mandatory valet. well, i guess it's not mandatory, but anyway....

i really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the best experience here at the Vig as you can see with my previous review, however the service has seemed to turn around for the better and their Posole is freaking amazing! Their chipotle mayo is also super good with their French fries. The Vig has been able to redeem themselves for me."}
{"text":"You would think when they told me that my order should be up in a few minutes they would check their tablet to see that they did not send the order to the kitchen.  They are so disorganized with their takeout service they should just stop the keep from pissing off customers.  What a let down as I had to wait an extra 25 minutes to pick up my order."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the Vig, what a beautiful patio. Love the fireplaces and nice chairs...I met this awesome DJ that was back there spinning, William Reed and we then sat inside as it was cold but it was so fun and nice tv's inside too. I will def go back more..."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is good. The atmosphere is very nice. The folks working there are friendly and the price is affordable."}
{"text":"made a stop in here last night via the Tuesday Trolley (which might I add, is a brilliant idea!). this was my first time to The Vig. We sat outside on a chilly night and enjoyed the KICKASS patio with a little heat from the propane heater next to our table. fantastic ambiance and the best part was the dj mixing some hip hop while another dude played a trumpet and guitar during certain parts. what a classy touch! we all loved it so much! the beverages were good and the service was as well. i can't believe i'd never been here before but i am a fan i will be returning!"}
{"text":"Pretty old crowd in here, but all the women here were gorgeous. The drinks were pretty good, but a little expensive, but i'am in phx so i guess i should expect it to be a coastly night. I guess I was jst looking for a place to kick back and relax and I found hat hard to do with the older crowd and all the men in suite's. Maybe I'll try this place on a friday or saturday next time. This was posted on yelp events I didn't see many people taking pictures of the place and didn't feel that I should take a lot of pictures in there last night. I think I took one, and I didn't get a chance to play bouchey ball. bummer."}
{"text":"Great location. Outside seating refreshed with misters and fans. Went on a late night snack run. Sunday's is half priced bottle of wine. We had the Mac and cheese and the wings and nachos and pozole everything was pretty good the Mac and cheese was a little soggy but still very cheesy. And the pozole had an American spin on it definitely not your abuelas pozole but still good. Would go back"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and what made the night perfect was having DeJae Proper spinning in the patio.  Miss this guy on Sundays at Uptown but glad he's here in Thursday's."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying food and ambiance wise this place is a 5 stars hands down. Clean, cool, busy (in a good way) and absolutely delicious. The reason for the 3 star rating is the service. I don't know if the Mothers Day brunch sucked the life out of everyone by the time I went (around 5) but my waitress (by the name of Kennedy) was the most unfriendly waitress I've ever had. Not one smile, very short, and in general appeared to be very uninterested in her job. Worst part is I was going for my birthday celebration with a friend. I would gladly go back, but perhaps to a different location where I won't risk being served by Kennedy. At first O thought she may have just had a gripe with my table for some reason, but I observed her with her other tables and her attitude was very much the same. 

Bottom line: Disappointing service, but excellent food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great ambiance, and loved the outside patio. Enjoyed the Vigazz Burger, which had an amazing secret sauce. Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Sure this place is fancy and has a nice patio... but they kind of can't get out of their own way.  Like, the food / drinks / dessert I tried were satisfactory but the seating was awkward and cramped due to the traffic.  

I suppose the difference between this place and somewhere like - Postino - is even though both are typically packed, Postino delivers like no other with their bruschetta and wine... this place just shows up.

The service was forgettable and thus the three star rating... meh - don't go out of your way to check 'em out."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre at BEST and the staff was slothful yet cute. The aggressive flies were a lot to deal with although their synchronized swimming in our drinks was impressive! The Vig downtown is a far better experience... your choice."}
{"text":"I enjoy the feel of this place - especially during the cooler weather.  Its nice and cozy with that upscale I'm not in PHX anymore feel.  Not to bag on PHX; I love the city for what it is :)  But you know what I mean!  The food is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've tasted.  Very heavy so share some apps or go family style...you'll be fine.  A glass of wine, please do, it's almost a must at this place.  Not the greatest wine selection, but it adds the allure to the feel I was talking about :)  Service, well it was there and they were on top of things.  There's a patio with a nice fire place - there used to be X-mas lights hanging from the trees and I don't recall seeing any this time - maybe a return with some friends and a bottle will refresh my memory :)  - enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. The outdoor area isn't as big as the Fillmore location, but they make up for it with live music. I really like the atmosphere and the food is pretty spot on. The sweet potato fry dip is really something special. The Vig was highly recommended to me, and I'm passing that recommendation on to all who read this."}
{"text":"Pozole heaven! I'm extremely picky about where I go get pozole from however this place never lets me down! Huge bowl and fairly priced! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent the Vig quite often, however this last trip has inspired me to write my first Yelp! review.  The food.  

The music: eclectic, relaxing, and at a volume that allows conversation.  Last night (Tuesday) they had a live DJ scratching accompanied by a live musician who played the guitar and trumpet.  I'd go back JUST for them.
The drinks: fairly priced, although we haven't made it for Happy Hour yet.  
The bocce ball: among the best in town.

The food: fantastic.  I thought the prices were a bit steep for \"bar food,\" but this is not your average chicken strips and mozzarella balls.  We ordered the most opposite thing on the menu... VigAzz Burger and the Vigan... not quite Vegan.  Both were large portions and full of flavor.  It wasn't your everyday cheeseburger... trust me, my wife is a cheeseburger connoisseur.  Plus, they didn't skimp on the fries.

Why didn't I give the Vig 5 stars?  The Valet parking!  I understand the lot only has 15 spots, but there is an entire shopping center across the street with ample amounts of parking.  On Friday night when we went there, they had the empty parking lot roped off with a parking bouncer who stopped everyone from trying to enter saying they HAD to valet.  Then last night, a Wednesday night, they had Valet again... luckily no parking lot bouncer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I really REALLY love everything about it. It's got a cool, kinda trendy but mellow vibe.  The low lit bar/indoor dining area is very stylish and definitely reminds you of  something in L.A or Scottsdale. 
The outdoor dining area is AWESOME-nicely lit and VERY cozy feeling. And though there were people dining outside, it was a little too warm in my opinion. Like I said, this place has a Scottsdale feel complete with all the beauitful people. Definitely more upscale clientele, but it's very casual. I was able to sneak away just as well-dressed cougar was starting to stalk me.
I had a burger which was really good. The menu is a little limited, but there is a good selection of appetizers, salads sandwiches as well as some steak, chicken and pasta entrees. Everything is reasonably priced as are the drinks. This place is not cheap, but the quality of the food and drinks make for  good value in my opinion. The prices definitely do not reflect the atmosphere, as you'd certainly expect more expensive drinks and food when you first walk in and see the place.
All that  being said, the parking situation SUCKS and it's in a slightly dodgy area (there's a cheap Mexican drive-thru on one side of it, and residences on the other side. Across the street (where you have to park if you don't want to do valet) is a drive thru liquor store and a check-chasing place. You have to park north of the check-cashing place if you don't want to be towed.  
But DON'T let any of this deter you from checking this place out. It's one of my favorite places in Phoenix and I'm so glad I checked it out. This is one of those places to bring out of town friends and family-it will impress the hell out of them (once they get past the neighborhood)"}
{"text":"They always have good food. The drinks specials are decent. I appreciate the service and I love how close it is to the house. I like the atmosphere and it's upscale dive bar."}
{"text":"This is THE place to be Sunday afternoons.

Live music, good food and drinks on the back patio.

It doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Went to this place a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch. Love the patio and live music. Had a great food and drink menu and quick service. I have no complaints... This place was AWESOME and will be going there again next time I am in town :)"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. This is one of those places where there was mandatory valet parking, so be prepared to tip. I actually had a tough time finding the front door (even pre drinks) because of the way everything is situated and hidden. Inside the waitstaff was fun and friendly, and there was definitely a crowd. The drink menu was great and includes a specialty Moscow Mule that is different every night of the week. I think ours was orange flavored- I sampled a friend's and it was delicious. The food was great for pretty typical bar food- I think I ordered half the menu. Bacon mac and cheese, nachos, sliders, etc. Overall it was a great place to meet up with friends and have some fun."}
{"text":"You ever get so excited to visit a eatery, and it ends up just being ok...
The skinny 
My girlfriend and her Hawaii'n crew decided to meet up for a triple date about a week ago I have been anticipating this trip so much, I have been researching the menu and drinks. I originally wanted to go with Mac and cheese as I keep reading reviews but I was very hungry and love al pastor so I decided on the pastor street tacos (10$) and the Harlem shake (9$) our waitress was amazing she was always there when the table needed something. The Harlem shake was great but I didn't realize it came in a martini glass so I got laughed at by my group for having such a sex and the city drink lol. To me the best part of the meal was the banana bread pudding dessert (7$) the soft warm gooey taste of fresh banana bread pudding with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream everyone in my table enjoyed it.
The bad 
Parking is horrible I ended up parking near a church and trekked my way over no big deal. The pastor tacos, for a lack of a better word was a huge let down not only did they look smaller than the appetizers, the al pastor was burnt and tasted like steak not like it had been marinating for days tortillas were a bit cold so made them taste different than they should. I was finished with my meal and still very hungry :-( I ended up trying a few other things from my tables order but felt bad. 
Overall 
I will be back to check out happy hour but for my money and appetite I will be going elsewhere for dinner. Great service staff."}
{"text":"The Vig is all around amazing!!!!! Late night menu was so delicious.

The wings we had were the traditional buffalo style and they finish them grilled. You don't see many places that do that and it is a nice touch.

The sliders are of decent size and served on a pretzel bun with a nice aioli. One of the best burgers that I have had, very good flavor and all the small things like good veggies, cheese, and seasoned just right to make it one memorable burger.

Oh yes the fries are high quality, the must fry them in a different oil than the run of the mill place, thin fries that were way better than the average fry.

Still had room for the mac and cheese which followed the trend of being an amazing dish. Rich, cheesy, and full of flavor.

This was just from the late night menu, I would love to come back and try some of their featured entrees. I am very impressed with the Vig and I am glad I stopped here late night to eat."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I've been here 3 times in the last couple of year's.  The food is good and the service is even better.  They have a nice variety of mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for the macaroni & cheese.  Order the mac and cheese and ask for a large portion.   Seriously, the best mac and cheese I have found in the valley.

The patio is very cool and bocce ball is entertaining.

The atmosphere is like, \" the scottsdale frat-boyz invaded arcadia\".  Your typical snottsdale D-bags invading westward.  what are you gonna do?"}
{"text":"The food was good and the atmosphere is unique. Had to walk to the hostess station to get straws for water glasses, to-go containers, and water refills. My last mimosa contained a clumpy substance the consistency of a tapeworm and I had to spit it on the ground (see picture). I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Never order take out from this place unless you want to wait for an hour and a half, otherwise it's a great place with friendly competent service and great food that won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"I'd give a higher review, but how is smoking still allowed on a restaurant patio in 2018? Here for a nice outdoor dinner but forced to endure cigarette smoke from several people inside the patio and a number of lurkers outside."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place very classy great atmosphere good food reasonable prices however my biggest complaint is the parking and every time I drive by I always see people running a crossed it's a bit scary since they are never in the crosswalk.  I should say parking is available but across the street if this place had better parking it would get five stars for me for sure."}
{"text":"I am another one to dig the vig...  
the gf and I decided for a night out, being so close and hearing about this place we decided to make a night of it. 
We didn't get anything to eat there, just a few drinks. I really liked the whole atmosphere and in/out design. 
Having Stella on tap was a HUGE plus in my book...  great selection and even has a bit of a wine selection. Bartender made my ladies' Madras (?!?) pretty tasty... so all in all this place is definately a place where i tend to come back to"}
{"text":"The pastor tacos are amazing. Closest pastor tacos I can find similar to tacos in Mexico. The edamame with garlic soy glaze can be a bit salty but delicious, service was ok. I'll be back"}
{"text":"We met friends for a 7pm dinner tonight (Wednesday) at The Vig... We sat outside and Cesar was our waiter.  There was a live jazz trio playing and we were also paid a visit from our kitty cat friend.

The menu changed since my last visit which was some time ago.  I recognized many Old Standby items, but some new ones too... 

We started with drinks - I had a glass of Malbec, the boys each had beer, and our pregnant friend had a virgin mojito.  And while the five spice edamame appetizer was missing a spice or three, we still managed to eat most of it.  For main courses, I went for the Veggie Korma, J had the decomposed fish tacos, Jeremy had the Steak Salad and Johanna enjoyed the chicken sandwich.

Next time I'll hope to try the new Vig, but this one is super close, convenient, and fun.  I still highly recommend it after all of these years!"}
{"text":"love this place, great beer, food and atmosphere. the seasonal beer is always good"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the outdoor patio open dining room area of the vig. The indoor area is small maybe a dozen tables. However, the patio is very spacious with lots of room for bocce ball. 

For me the big draw to the vig is the food menu. Love the pork nachos, mac & cheese with steak tips, several great salads & the grilled cheese with sweet potato french fries. It's comfort food at it's best! Actually it's comfort food dressed up a little so you don't feel like an 8 year old ordering grilled cheese or mac & cheese. 

And since it's important to feel adult when ordering kid food you have to have a cocktail at the vig. There is usually always a specialty cocktail on special ($5). And they usually have something fun to offer with a infused vodka or such. Cocktails are usually around $7.  

Overall it's one of my favorite bars in the Arcadia area. Just a fun atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight. Parking was a nightmare. Mostly valet only. Arrived at 6 pm (when Happy Hour ends) and the entire place was packed. The bar was full, all the indoor seating was full, even in the summer most of the patio was taken. Patio was large with lots of great outdoor seating. It turned out to be worth the wait. The ceviche and the grouper were really yummy but I would avoid the duck salad. The service was mediocre but the waitress was very busy with tons of full tables. It was a fun, hip, and trendy place although it was really loud and crowded. Not the place to go if you want a quiet dinner with no scene."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with some associates. I can always count on the Vig for good fresh food and a pleasant atmosphere. We frequent both locations and receive the same quality service and food no matter.
Thanks to the staff and ownership(s) for caring!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE!!!  I hope that I have an opportunity to come back and enjoy this restaurant in the evening sometime.  What a cool vibe it has.  Nice and cool indoor seating and a fun outdoor area with a full bar as well.  I had the Greek salad for lunch which was so refreshing and quite delicious.  The staff was attentive and seemed happy to be there."}
{"text":"Got seated right away and the food was good. Best of all beers are served with an ice cold cup.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"In town for work trip, made our first stop at The Vig for brunch with my wife.  Got right in before the crowd showed up and sat at a table on the back patio.  Food did not disappoint...had a Vig Burger and Best Day-Turkey sandwich on a pretzel bun.  The service was just ok, not very attentive, but not bad.
Definitely recommend and will visit again."}
{"text":"So we went here on Monday to celebrate another milestone in my sweetheart's life. The staff there is awesome and even changed the channel for us to catch a little Monday Night Football as we did our unedited (and OH so funny) version of \"Oh My God What Is S/He Wearing, Volume 2\". 

I am a BIG fan of their Thai Sweet Chili Hot Vings. Those get 4.5 stars easily!

We also had the edamame with their signature spice rub (very yummy, but towards the end it was a teensy bit *greasy* for my taste), the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken, and the banana-nut bread pudding w/ ice cream.  

I wasn't very impressed with the bread pudding, don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was very flavorful, and I'm always on the lookout for the perfect one. (*note* If there is even the HINT of a raisin in the bread pudding, I will not go near it. I like raisins, some of my best friends are raisins, or something to that effect...just not in my bread *giggle*) 

I love the atmosphere here, it is a GREAT place to do some people watching, the patio is awesome, although I refuse to sit on ANY patio between July and September here...I'm already hot-blooded, I don't need to be reheated in any shape or fashion! 

Great place, great atmosphere, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"First time ever coming to this location. Valet parking is a requirement unless you park across the street. Great atmosphere until the live band started, nearly went deaf from the speakers going whacky! Waitress was nice and served us in a timely manner. Food was decent, although, when I asked specifically for no onion, and was delivered a burger with onion, I wasn't too impressed. For the price point, I expect better quality and attentiveness to detail. Overall ok, nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"We love this place...food and service! Happy hour is fabulous and has one of my favorite appetizers in the city....fish tacos (but I order with out the tortillas).  Their wings are also wonderful."}
{"text":"I love The Vig. The atmosphere is really laid back and I love the out door seating area. It has one set of string lights with large bulbs making its way through the trees. I like that they also have a handful of Trivial Pursuit cards at each table to help keep the table entertained while waiting for food or while kicking back a few drinks.. They also have misters so its never too hot outside.. however, if no one has been sitting at the table for a little, the table and chairs may be wet so watch where you sit!

I have been here twice so far and plan to continue to come back here often. The first time I was here I had the gauc and chip. The gauc is refreshing and light with a good flavor- definitely a good place to start with food here. I also had the vanilla braised short rib tacos. I felt like the meat was really sweet by itself. When eating it altogether in its taco form it was still a little on the sweet side but really good.  

This last time I was here I ordered the nachos with carnitas and I was very happy with the dish that came out. The topping to chip ratio was amazing. I would even go far enough to say that there were more toppings than there were chips, which the little fat kid inside me LOVES. My bf got the triple sliders on the pretzel bun with a side of the fries. The fries are so good. They are very thinly cut but still manage to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The burgers were good but nothing really to talk about other than they have a pretzel bun. My friend who was with us got the thai chili wings and that was delicious. The wings were not too spicy nor to sweet. It was a very good mix of both."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

The Vig has four locations:
Arcadia, Fillmore, McCormick Ranch, Uptown

This was my first visit to The Vig Arcadia. 

I had to meet a friend for lunch and he chose The Vig. I had heard a lot of great things about The Vig Arcadia, so I had high hopes.

Although the atmosphere is super cute and intimate, it borders on too closet-y tiny when the restaurant starts filling up. 

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

I got there early, so I sat at the bar and decided to check my phone. My battery was very low, so I asked the bartender to point out the closest outlet, or I suggested she could take my phone, so she could charge it behind the bar. 

Unfortunately, the self-proclaimed \"staff manager\" was rude and positional beyond belief, which are literally the only 2 qualities a server doesn't need to have.

Me: \"Hi! I'm m waiting for a friend for lunch, do you mind plugging my phone and I'll have a greyhound.\"

- We don't have outlets. 

Me: \"Well, that isn't exactly the true, because everything in this bar is using electricity, including the blender you just used, so what you're really saying is that you can help me, you just don't want to. I find it shocking that an upscale restaurant in Scottsdale doesn't have outlets.\"

- This is Arcadia, not Scottsdale. 

At that point, as she was completely rambling about the difference between Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as the status of the electrical systems and a fierce desire to convince me that an upscale establishment doesn't have outlets. 

\"Obviously, there are outlets in restaurant. Clearly, you just don't WANT to plug in my phone.\"

I asked to speak to the manager, which apparently they didn't have one of those either or she wasn't allowing me access to him. 

I did still had hope that she might serve me that greyhound. 

Anyway, my friend arrived and we moved from the bar to a table. 

Then, the second part seems almost like were at another bar altogether. 

A new waitress cheerily gave us waters, told us the specials, said she would give us a minute, and was gone. 

She came back a minute later and took our order. All the appetizers arrived in minutes. 

The food was delicious. The server was a delight.

THE MENU

Appetizers
Artichoke Kale Jalapeño Dip (which I had)
Steamed Edamame (which I had)
Guacamole & Chips (which I had)
Flatbreads
Nachos
Hot Wings

Salads
Sandwiches 
Burgers

Mains:
Vanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos (which I had)
Fish Tacos
Man n Cheese
Grilled Salmon
Pad Thai

Desserts

CONCLUSION 

I have to say the the vanilla braised short rib tacos are some of the best food I ever put in my mouth. 

It's a shame to see an owner and the chef putting so much effort into making the restaurant a success, lose an extreme amount of business just because of one argumentative server who can leave such a lasting impression on customers. 

4/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Great casual spot and the veggie burger is awesome! The severs are all very nice and I will keep going back and bring friends."}
{"text":"This has been my go to ever since moving to Phoenix. I love the food and atmosphere. Staff used to be great too. I'm not sure if it's just a bad coincidence or what but the service the last 3 times was just awful. It took me 2 orders to get both my food and SIMPLE two step cocktail right. Was ignored many times sitting at the bar. 

I'd of given 5 if the service hadn't slipped so severely."}
{"text":"So, the Vig and I are unlikely friends ... but we get along real nicely despite our glaring differences.

It has the facade of an old Motor Inn Lodge, found somewhere deep in the Midwest, complimented by a spacious sun patio and a bocce court.  Yet it has the modern opulence you would expect in Arcadia.  When the Vig combines the two, you get dap cocktails and wine in the most comfortable and inviting surroundings. 

In my opinion, the Vig is the best place in the Valley to day drink, especially on a lazy Sunday when you can sit up on the bar, feast on their Posole, drink Mechiladas (which they will make upon request), and venture out into the warm sun after working up a chill in their cavernous interior.  They also have half-price wine on Sundays.

I also must mention that their staff is probably the most friendly group of people out of any bar I've been in around the valley."}
{"text":"On a business trip to PHX I had the opportunity to meet friends for dinner. The Vig was their idea and it was delightful.. The cocktails were well crafted and the food was fun and delicious. Great staff.Good casual atmosphere. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great food, great specials, and even better ambiance.  Only thing holding this place back as my favorite \"go to place\" for drinks and meal is the service.

Meal:  I had a Monte Cristo for brunch the last time I was there.  I also had the cheesy tater-tots.

Taste:  My sandwich and the sides were awesome.  It wasn't fussy, simple, fun, and done extremely well.  I felt like the food was extremely fresh and \"thoughtful,\" in that the meal options for the time of day were perfect and had their own, unique twists without jumping the shark.  9 out of 10.

Value:  At first, I was taken back on what I thought were small portions but I came hungry and left full.  I think I was doing more thinking with my stomach than with my brain when I first got my meal.  The proportions are more than fair and reasonable but it won't blow you out of the water.  4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  I hate to say it, but they hostesses and waitresses seem like a bunch of airheads.  Very nice and sweet people but they come off as clueless at times and lack the professional polish that would be consistent and expectedt with experienced and professional restaurant employees.  You have to sometimes \"help connect the dots for them\" and they were too often having to \"ask the chef\" what is included in the food.  In all, the staff appears not to be attentive and not knowledgeable about the menu.  Again, very nice and sweet people but service has some opportunities to grow.  Parking is a major issue and can be difficult.  6 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  The Vig has the best outdoor scene by far.  Inside of The Vig is great but the patio is even better.  They also have a neighborhood cat name Meow-Meow that comes around and she is a supper sweet kitty.  Wish I could give more than 5 points . . . OH WAIT!  This is my fucking review and I will give them two bonus points for the excellent ambiance! 7 out of 5.  (The Vig is the first review I have ever given that received bonus points.  Probably the biggest honor they have ever received!  No?  Ok, you are probably right, it is not much of any honor, but still, it is exciting to me!)

Overall:  The fiance and I are having our rehearsal dinner here because we like it so much.  It is a great way to show the fun and trendy side of Phoenix to our mid-western guests. 26 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a LONG time.  I remember the burgers are YUM!  But The Frenchy sandwich on the menu was screaming \"GET ME, GET ME, ORDER ME!\".  But my friend saw that I was torn so she ordered the Vigazz Burger and offered to share.  So, I had 1/2 a Frenchy and 1/2 the Vigzz Burger.  WOOOOOOOOO....

Frenchy - SO GOOD!  Love the dipping sauce.
Vigazz Burger - The zing from the sauce, Yum!  Cook to perfection burger.
French Fries - Love those skinny fries with the seasoning.

The service was great!!!"}
{"text":"I only had dessert and a drink here, but it was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and the patio was a real treat."}
{"text":"Love it here! I moved here from San Diego and it is honestly the only place that reminds me of home. The app's are good, but the cocktails is where it's at! Go early and get a table outside, order the flat bread and try the key lime cocktail!"}
{"text":"cool atmmopshere, great sweet potato fries!  love the hugh patio on nice days, a great cocktail lounge with a fun menu."}
{"text":"Tried this place today after buying a Deal Chicken certificate.  We sat on the patio which is just fabulous!  Lots of shade, misters that you can actually feel, and comfortable chairs.  I had some drink with \"skinny\" in the name...tequila, fresh orange and lime juice, etc.  Super good....and strong.  The bf said they had a great beer selection.  He had Anchor Steam which not many bars seem to have, so he was very happy!  I had the The Vigan....grilled vegetable sandwich.  Very good, but next time I'll order it without the cheese as it was unnecessary and I ended up taking most off anyway.  Fries were great....very skinny and crispy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings are pretty good. The nachos were slightly soggy from being to go, but I've had them before in person and they're pretty good!"}
{"text":"We had come here to grab some lunch over the weekend since la grande orange power was down.  I was debating between two things and decided to go with the mac and cheese. I couldn't believe it was soupy. I was hoping it would be baked which is always way better. Such a disappointment  since my mac and cheese on the stove turns out a million times better than what they gave me. Since I happen to be sick i was really thirsty and the waitress took forever after our appetizers came to refill my lemonade.  After she had realized I went through 2 glasses fast she started to get the hint to stick around.  But just b/c of that reason shouldnt keep a waiter or waitress around to see if we needed anything as a courtesy."}
{"text":"I had to give an update to my favorite bar.  It is now 5 stars!  Why you ask?  Well, I spent the better part of Sunday, my last day of a long vacation, here and it couldn't have been more enjoyable.  

A day drink was suggested and the Vig was the place to be apparently.  The place was packed inside and out.  Not a seat to be had outside.  There was a cool band playing cover songs.  The specials on Sunday are pretty sweet as well.  $3 Peronis, Margs, and half off bottles of wine.  Which if you don't finish your wine, they give you a nice little brown baggie to take it home in.  Ahhhh, the VIG."}
{"text":"This place is a cougar spot. Which is kinda cool I guess. They let you sit down at a table while you wait for your food and drinks. Very trendy."}
{"text":"Been coming here since yhey opened.   Now they have  multiple locations and different  styles  ... such a good Phoenix spot and still coming. 
Sup Pauly  and Logan?!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the others. 

A must try is the MAC and cheese! So yummy. 

I went on a Saturday night and not much of a crowd, which I love! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Update: it's been a minute. Mikes still married. Still going hard. I guess if you marry the right person you can go hard for life. 

Good for you Mike"}
{"text":"Okay for drinks, never eaten there.  I've only been there with my GF and her work buddies for drinks. 

I agree with the earlier comments regarding the Vig as being a place for people to see and be seen.  It's in a peripheral neighborhood of Arcadia and seems to aspire to be the equivalent of a Scottsdale club.  It doesn't make it.

First, there's no need for valet parking.  This isn't the kind of neighborhood for it.  Take over the cheap Mexican place immediately to the north and let people park there.  Sorry, folks, this ain't Scottsdale.  A lot of people don't care to have valets park their vehicle in a midrange bar.

Had two drinks, honestly poured, a little pricey--but then, you're paying for a \"trendy\", Gen X and Y atmosphere.  Beer price was all right.  The trouble is that this place seems to be a dive which is trying to reinvent itself as a \"happening\" place.  

I'm an Arizona native, and could immediately wonder why a bar would put upholstered furniture on the patio in the middle of summer.  Guess they don't mind replacing cushions yearly.  

I'll repost after eating there; thus, this is an incomplete review.  However, if you like to see either older women on the make or the younger crowd showing off, cool.  But this place might do better as a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This place takes everything that is lame about Scottsdale and wraps it into one neat little package in Phoenix.  I was so excited for a new bar in the hood, but then this showed up.  Bad food, plastic people, crappy music, too sterile.  Pretty poopy."}
{"text":"This place is great! I used to live in the Phoenix area and had a layover the other night. A friend grabbed me from the airport and took me straight to The Vig for drinks.

The space is gorgeous. I loved the mix of indoor and outdoor seating, with the benefit of a fireplace, trees, and well-placed lighting. I also loved the bar kitty, what a cutie. 

We came in late on a week night, and it wasn't overly busy. The servers were friendly and helpful, with good tips on food and drink. I enjoyed my Irish Exit, although I hoped for a little more umph from the plum bitters. The nachos were amazing. We made quick work of them and I considered pushing for another plate. Kinda wish I had, they were that good.

Don't know when I'll be Arizona way again, but I'd love to return to The Vig when I am."}
{"text":"Had a great time in the outdoor relaxed setting.  Even though it was busy the had plenty of bar staff that was friendly.  It was a nice setting for #ptpubnight too."}
{"text":"I go for the friends, food and fun. 

No Malibu. So it's hard to come here for happy hour and enjoy the hustle and bustle of things. I will indulge my peeps and meet them here although they ALWAYS feel bad for forgetting I am a snob that doesn't drink fake Malibu imposters. 

Food wise, their happy hour menu is good and decently priced. Just odn't order it to go or they will charge the non-HH menu price. Vings are quite tasty and spiced just right. I always get the guac and chips and sliders get a thumbs up as well. 

The patio is a great place to be during the spring and late fall when the weather is probably what heaven is like 24/7. Lots of tables, a cozy little area near the gas fireplace and bocci ball on the side. They also have a bar on the back patio which opens up during private patio parties and late night... Sundays during the day, also."}
{"text":"I had an out of town friend in for a work conference who happened to be staying at the Biltmore.  I decided to bring her here, and I was glad that this was my selection.  We both thought that the atmosphere was great, and enjoyed good conversation while people watching.  We got a table that was not exactly outside but on the edge of the inside, which was the best of both worlds.  

We enjoyed the silly Vig entree names and both enjoyed our meals.  We had the guac and chips as an appetizer and I had the Hot Chick as a meal.  The guacamole was alright, but I'd probably only suggest my entree.  

This place is a drive for me, but if I happen to be in that part of town, I'd definitely visit it again."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  Went on a Sunday right when they opened for brunch.  We both ordered the Healthy Omelette.  It had no taste to it at all and I swear the spinach had been previously frozen.  I guess when you order something labeled healthy you don't always get a lot of taste so I could have lived with that but geez...  When I pay $10 - 12 bucks for something that probably cost them $.75 to make, couldn't they at least throw a little garnish on the plate?  The omelette looked so lonely there all bare naked.  Hey, maybe a little fresh fruit or toast or SOMETHING?  Sprig of parsley perhaps?
I ordered a side of toast to split with my friend and well - it wasn't toast because it wasn't toasted long enough and the bread looked (and tasted) like something I'd get at the dollar store.
This was my first visit to the Vig (either one) so maybe the person doing the cooking was just having a bit of a rough start to his or her day.  Don't think I'll be back though."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went into the Vig on saturday June 3 at 1:40pm. We were immediately seated outside and given our waters right away. From there we waited 25 minutes and were never serviced. Our server never acknowledged us, never asked us if we wanted drinks, and never took our order. She came out several times and took orders of people who came in after us. We ended up just leaving, and as we were walking out no one said anything. There were only 4 other groups on the patio outside. I'm not sure why we were never serviced but I just thought the owner or manager should we aware."}
{"text":"g and i drive up and see the valet sign - $2. really? you offer no onsite parking except valet and you require me to pay for it? i will tip ... i always tip. but actually charge a fee? ugh. so not classy. that started things off on the wrong foot. 

g and i were the last to show up. our group of 6 was seated at a table on the patio that was clearly made for four, five at the most. i was smashed between  two others - i'm all for being the peanut butter, but this was absurd - i spent the meal dodging elbows. tables were too high or the seating was too low. either way, it made for an awkward and uncomfortable dinner. the staff had to notice the awkward arrangement - i don't know how you could miss it. 

anyway, onto the food ... well, it was fine. my caesar salad was fine, as one might expect - it is pretty hard to screw up caesar salad. g had the wings and the sauce was more bbq-y than buffalo-y. the menu seemed to be a bit pretentious: words like \"deconstructed\" and \"dauphinoise\" litter it. the energy was really, really strange. yes, it is a modern pub, but i kind of expected more. and yes, the valet situation and the place's creepy energy really irked me."}
{"text":"The Vig is definitely trendy, and always happening in Arcadia. I love the location and overall atmosphere of the place.

It's a good place to head to for happy hour, or a pre-game/in-between places. I don't understand the hype it has in most crowds though. Their food tends to be good but not great, and I am always slightly disappointed in most things I order. I always try new things and have been at least 10 times (so it's definitely not for lack of effort). The mac and cheese is a bit bland especially, which is so discouraging! Mac and cheese is delicious 9 out of 10 times, but not superb here.

I do enjoy some of their cocktail options, such as the Daily Mules! Yum! They also always tend to be out of a lot of their draft options, or don't carry much! 

If you're in the area and need to kill time, I definitely say go for it! But it's not the top of my list."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I ordered a mimosa and a classic burger and everything came out fantastic. Burger was seasoned and moist and I was able to have it medium well. The fries here are delicious. The mimosa here is super yummy as well. If I'm ever around this area, I'll definitely drop by. Servers were all nice and friendly and I love the environment and vibe I get from this place."}
{"text":"The band tonight is awesome, ironically we met the lead singer at an old town bar about a month ago. It was raining and we were the only ones on the patio, he was solo that night and really good but tonight with all his friends he really is amazing! 

Ps 
Food is pretty good, atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"Their posole is amazing & spicy! Wings are great! Music is a tad too loud when trying to carry on conversations but all in all great food & atmosphere."}
{"text":"I figure it's time to review The Vig.  I've been there probably 10 times between the Arcadia location and the Uptown, and Sweet Pea and I met the gang up at Arcadia on Saturday night.

Let me just say, I like The Vig- I don't love it.  In fact, I hated it the first couple of times I went there...more about that in just a minute.  I am not in love with the place like so many are, it just fills a niche.  It's centrally located, it has a patio, drinks, some OK food, etc.  I don't care about the clientele, whether it's hipster dbags or whatever- if I like the place and I'm with my crew, I don't really care who else is around.

The problem with the place is the service.  It's not just indifferent, or bad, it's almost impossibly TERRIBLE.  My second experience at The Vig caused me to almost never return.  Sweet Pea and I were there on an afternoon, the place was pretty empty, and we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally reached out and grabbed a waitress's arm to get her to acknowledge us.  The waitstaff literally stood around chatting, and several of them looked at us as they walked by and kept on walking.  I mean, I've had better service at brasseries in Paris.

Saturday was no different.  We sat outside, this is before it even got busy, and didn't see waitstaff for a half hour.  We sent someone in to the bar to get drinks.  We waved arms frantically as we saw waitresses in the distance but never coming over.  Finally, I yelled out \"excuse me!\" to a busboy passing by and asked him if there was indeed waitstaff assigned to our section that evening.  He went off to get someone, and I watched her come out and start down the row of tables, stopping at each one, refreshing drink orders, taking food orders, and finally she's at the table right next to ours...and...this is where it gets good...SHE TURNS AROUND AND LEAVES.  I mean, it's like she's trying to avoid us at this point.  I had to send the busboy back after her, and when she finally showed up- no apology, no acknowledgment...actually, she seemed annoyed to have to even come to our table.  We were all being so nice to her when she did finally come, I had to ask why we were kissing this woman's a$$- so she would deign to come back to our table and wait on us???  Man that's messed up.

Can it be that hard to find waitstaff who is both attractive enough for this super hip trendy place AND can serve me food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time??  I guess so."}
{"text":"Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!"}
{"text":"The Vig is one of those really hip restaurants that are popping up all over Arizona. It's where young people in their mid 20s-40s hang out to grab some good food and drinks. There's an outdoor and indoor area that are both pretty cool and great to hang out in as long as it's not summer in the blazing heat.

As a group, we shared the wings, nachos, and sweet potato fries. If you are already there and need an appetizer to get, I definitely recommend the wings. The fries are fine but not better than you would get anywhere else. Nachos were okay as well. I think as a group, we enjoyed the wings the most.

For the entree, I got the mac and cheese with bacon and oh my gosshhh. It is sooo goood. I already love mac and cheese because it has two of my favorite things (carbs & cheese), but the addition of bacon and whatever else they put in there was awesome. Just know that it is VERY heavy and unless you are hungry, you wont be finishing this meal in one sitting."}
{"text":"Food was good and so was the bloody Mary bar. Service could have been warmer but we got everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Poor service and extremely hot inside, stuffed inside a oven!!! No fun, so we left. We did get a seat right away, but no one came to the table which added to our decision to leave. Will NOT waste my money here"}
{"text":"I managed to go years without going back to this overpriced joke of a bar, but as they say, time heals all wounds.

One trip back, though, and you can bet your ass it's the last. A mediocre burger, an adolescent grilled cheese (with American cheese, on white bread, with crusts cut off), a split side salad composed mostly of Iceberg lettuce, and a few drinks = $100+. Um.... NO.

The menu straight up sucks for vegetarians, despite the little \"We can accommodate vegans, just ask!\" blurb on the menu. I shudder to think what that might entail. Certainly, more Iceberg lettuce. 

I hate that the parking is mostly monopolized by the valet service. Pretentious and unnecessary.

The drinks were meh and the last one that came out wasn't even what I ordered. 

If you have fistfuls of cash and a desire to see and be seen, then by all means, go to the Vig. But if you're just average, neighborhood folk who want to sit outside, have some yummy chow and get your drink on for a reasonable sum... keep walkin'."}
{"text":"I just wanted to apologize on behalf of myself and my coworkers for coming in and spending money during happy hour on 1/21/16.  The blonde girl with the sparkling personality (manager?) made it very clear we weren't welcome and were a huge inconvenience.   Our intention was to merely enjoy yourselves and spend a few bucks, we are so sorry that was so offensive to your manager.    Have no fear though, it will NEVER happen again.  Your manager  (blonde in a leopard top) went out of her way to assure us that a group of professionals whom want to enjoy a quiet happy hour will in no way be tolerated, message received loud and clear.  One can only assume your manager was given strict instructions to be rude, offensive and ugly towards paying customers; give that girl a raise because she nailed it!"}
{"text":"I really loved the atmosphere of The Vig and I've been here a few times for drinks. If you go at night it is extremely dark inside like to the point you need to pull out a flashlight. Their Moscow mules were really great along with the wine list. My friend and I got the Kale Jalapeño and artichoke dip which was really really tasty although some parts of the dip were very cold and others were extremely hot. We decided to eat around the cold spots because it was honestly really tasty and we were so hungry. Along with that I got the hummus that came with pita, veggies, dried fruit and I got it with chicken. The hummus alone was really good. The dried fruit kinda weirded me out so I didn't have any. The chicken was under seasoned which was a bummer because it was an extra $4. The cooked zucchini came chilled which also kind of weirded me out. Other than the food and the darkness or the restaurant, the service was amazing. We had the friendliest server Ryan and I give him 5 stars! But as far as the food goes I'll probably just be back for drinks."}
{"text":"The Vig is a little too far away and a little too expensive for it to be a regular spot for my group. That said, I've never had a bad night at a Vig (there are two locations now - so be specific when telling your friends where you are!)

It's a very cool atmosphere, but sort of hard to describe. I almost want to call it a classy neighborhood bar? I mean the look and feel of it is very classy, and you get the feeling you should dress a little nicer than just heading to a pub, but then they have games, like bocce ball, that make it feel like your neighborhood bar. Very cool. 

I could see this being a great default spot for a young adult, professional crowd. Especially if you live nearby. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Meh. Came here with a group (about ten people, give or take) to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday (woo!) this past Saturday. My husband and I joined the group a little late, but we knew they were planning to be there awhile so we ordered food anyway. The service was extremely slow and unorganized. Our server was so random about taking orders, and I'm not even kidding you when I say that after I finally got my drink (Malibu & pineapple), I was not asked even one time if I wanted another (and we were there for 3 hours). My drink was empty for probably two and a half hours with not a single person checking on me. My husband was lucky enough to be asked once if he wanted another beer. And at the end of our visit, we had to tell the server what we ordered throughout the night. Didn't realize that was our job to keep track? So yeah, service was a one in my book. But the food - so good! I ordered the mac & cheese (don't judge!) and it was amazing! And only $5 - yay! My husband got the wings and he liked them a lot. The place was nice and all, but at nine the music started bumping and I'm just too old for that shit anymore. Overall it was fine. We had a lot of fun, despite bad service. I'd go back with a group, but probably would never recommend or suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"The best part of the The Vig is the live band on a Sunday. Well if your supposed to start at 6pm, then you should prep at least 30-45 min to start on time. Now, your have scurried ants trying to get it together to not be so late to begin."}
{"text":"The Vig is always good.  I've been to this location, as well as the \"Uptown\" location on MULTIPLE occasions.  I actually like Uptown a little better, but can't really pinpoint why.   Maybe because it's close to my office for a convenient happy hour?  Could be.   Either way, can't go wrong here.   This visit was a Sunday brunch after church.  Had a Bloody Mary with a little too much horseradish, then switched to mimosas.  Yum.    Food was also very good.  

Always love the Vig!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and a good beer tap selection. Friendly servers.  Definitely a good place to go if you need a place to go with friends, are in the downtown phoenix area, but don't have anything in particular in mind.  

Have to say that it is definitely geared towards the 20s-30s age group.  If you are older like me, you may or may not like it.  I felt a tad out of place, but no one was unfriendly.  Don't have anything bad to say, other than I wasn't WOWed.  Just a nice place to kick back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always a fun atmosphere. Lots of TV's for sports watching. Pretty outside deck too. One of our faves for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit this location at least once a week. We love how close it is to home and it's nice environment to just relax and have late night drinks. I would love to give this review 5 stars because many times the service is just that, but unfortunately the female staff are a bunch of snobby brats. They are extremely rude and have a very careless attitude. My boyfriend came in with friends yesterday and said his server was great but the second I showed up with my son she changed her attitude and was really rude the rest of the time. I just wish the females took some guidance from their male staff. It's sad that it even has to come down to male or female. But we do love The Vig!!!"}
{"text":"Caesar's service was fun, attentive, and informative.  My lady found his smile intoxicating."}
{"text":"I am from Tucson, but I love coming for the cocktails. They are creative, different & fun!"}
{"text":"I came here Saturday evening with my husband for dinner. We were seated right away on the patio. First and foremost, we LOVED the patio space and the atmosphere. It was populated without feeling too crowded. Great mix of people, great space. It was somewhere I'd want to sit with friends for the evening and just throw back some beers. 

We started with the flatbread of the day which was BBQ chicken. Delicious. I ordered the seasonal shrimp salad with prickly pear vinaigrette. My hubs got the turkey sandwich on a pretzel roll. The food was great. We were both pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. Yes it's a bar, so it's not the absolute best food I've ever put in my mouth. But it was damn good bar food and I would come back for the food and atmosphere in a heartbeat. 

Also our server was nice and attentive and the prices were great. For an app, two entrees, and two beers each it was $60. That is dirt cheap for Chicago standards. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I like The Vig, and am sure I'll be coming back again in the near future, but in general I'm just not that impressed. Good food and a cool, laid back atmosphere go a long way, but annoyingly slow and inattentive service go a long way too. We most recently had a group ranging from ten to fifteen, getting lots of food and drinks... well... attempting to get lots of food and drinks... and the service was just bad. They would only take a couple drink or food orders at once, not the order for the whole group, and we would have some people on their third drink while someone else was begging to get a first... it was just frustrating... At the end of the day I think you should try The Vig, it is a cool place worth spending some time in, but don't expect any type of perfection."}
{"text":"I am sitting at the Vig and I know the food will be good, the service excellent and it is close to my office. So why am I commenting? Apparently The management thinks the Vig is a dance club now.  The music is so loud, even outside, that it is  annoying. I came to meet a potential client who wanted to \"try the Vig\" and we will not be able to hear each other.

I was at Z Tejas yesterday and asked about the music and they were able to turn it down just a little which was enough. And yes I am an old guy who does not hear so well anymore. Be that as it may I still do not understand why a restaurant where you go to meet people and talk needs to  have concert level music going."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and have had such great experiences. Great HH selection and their Pozole is to DIE for. 

Great customer service and HOT, legendary bartenders. OoooEeeee! 

I have never valet'd before - they offer it, yes, but I always turn total cheap-skate and bypass it. Save yourself a buck - go self-park across the street and do it right."}
{"text":"I've got to upgrade this place to a five star joint for three reasons.

1.  Their half and half plate of hummus and babba gannoush is the best I've ever had.  And at $4 during happy hour, it's a great way to start the night.

2.  Their gin and tonics are out of this world.  I don't know what they do differently, but it's a little sweeter and you can't taste the gin at all.  Warning: having 5+ of these guarantees that you will be hammered.

3.  The Vig Rig which was sweet enough to cater to two drunk girls and drop them off at their separate homes.  If only we knew that you picked up people to, then we wouldn't have had to deal with being stranded for the first part of our Saturday morning.

Even with your crowd of douches and cougars, I can't help but love you for my experience Friday night!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda out of place.  Wait, that didn't make sense.  The Vig is all kinds of incongruous.  Is that better?  

The outside, a plain, wood-planked facade on a lightly-traveled street, doesn't match the inside, a sleekly designed bar & dining area.

The inside, which looks straight out of scottsdale, doesn't match the more laid back neighborhood.

The menu, an ambitious attempt at upscale bar food with a touch of fine dining, doesn't match the bar atmosphere.  

I went for lunch and had their house special burger.  It really was tasty, and paired with a few options, including a plie of shoestring fries or sweet potato fries, but, again, the identity crisis pops up.  It also comes with a little salad.  Salad?  With a burger?  I'm eating a huge chunk of meat and deep-fried potatoes and NOW I'm gonna start eating healthy?  

The Vig tries to be so many different things at once, that it never really owns any one thing.  The face it shows is all Scottsdale- posh with a hint of fake.  

It really is an establishment in an identity crisis."}
{"text":"\"Yay! I'm a fan\" pretty much says it all for me about The Vig. I have been about a half dozen times and always get the same thing.....The Vig Cobb. I just have a thing for Cobb salads and when I find one with the right combination of ingredients I don't like to stray. We went yesterday and my girlfriend ordered the Greek salad which looked pretty darn tempting so I may have to cheat on my beloved Cobb next time.

I love the patio and atmosphere. I love that they have a kitty roaming around that is super friendly and cute. The staff is really friendly and fast so The Vig is a great place for lunch meetings or just a quick lunch in general."}
{"text":"Hotel employee told us about this place. Wow. So worth it. Not sure why people bring their little kids. Entertainment was good. Food was great."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Every time we go to the Vig our servers never come by to check up on us. Last time we went, we sat for an entire hour before the server came back again. It's a shame because we really enjoy the atmosphere and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times but I'd rather be more positive than nit-picky.  The service has always been a bit slow and less informative.  I've come in and on several occasions lost out on the specials till the very end when the server mentions \"next time you should do the....\" well I wish I would've known that earlier because I could've enjoyed more awesomeness!  Otherwise I love the atmosphere and the seating.  The space is really good, outdoor seating during this time of the year is jam and ambience are spot on for a group or a more datish type situation.  I've tried a few of the dishes and the food is pretty good but nothing yet that I've built up a craving for.  I'll be back soon for the Tuesday special of an app with a bottle of wine for $22 buckaroos!"}
{"text":"We made the mistake of showing up at 4 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. Live band was incredibly LOUD. Surprising that there was an open table on the patio, but were not greeted for at least 15 minutes. Saw lots of servers LOOK RIGHT AT US with no acknowledgement. Finally grabbed a busser and said, \"we have not been greeted, 3 waters please.\" When she finally came over I asked for a reccomendation on perhaps a house cocktail? She said, \"All of our drinks are listed in this menu.\" I know. I just had 15 minutes to read it. Had a beer and left. Really awful. Never again."}
{"text":"We came to the Vig on a very busy Saturday and had a little trouble parking, but we got inside and were immediately seated. Our waiter was attentive and quick to get us everything needed, and came to check on us when it was needed. I got the chicken sandwich and the sweet potato fries and my fiancée got the Asian chopped salad. My sandwich was very good, the sweet potato fries were amazing. The fiancée loved her salad. I was a bit disappointed in the beer selection but I survived. I think we will eat here again, as they was a couple of other menu items that looked really really good like their Mac and cheese! I did see that there is a location closer to my home so I think we will hit that one next!"}
{"text":"Our first Vig experience was the one off Bethany Home. We had a riot there in the indoor patio playing beer-enhanced games of skill. This time we came for a game, went to the 40th street bar. We have been here twice. The Vig/Postino crowd is really great. The decor and lighting is really trendy and the bartender here was as attentive as they come. In our two times here, we have tried the Reuben, Burgers, Vings (I like the Asian style), and pear and chopped salads. I tried some of everyones. Its that good. The other thing that is really bad but great for soaking up alcohol is the cheesy tots. Not what you think,  so I will let you be surprised. Happy Hour is best hour, great drink deals and specials. It is always happening, no matter when we go, but the Arcadia site is big enough to hold em all. Never a bad time."}
{"text":"Excellent food the flavors i love, had the classic burger on the deal night it was busy but the food was hot and fresh which is VERY important and the flavors was so yummy the atmosphere was great, really enjoyed this VIG   Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the second Vig we have visited and both have inadequate parking. We won't return to this one because we were told after 4:30 all parking was valet. The parking areas were virtually empty. We parked across the street in the shopping center lot and had to cross a dangerous street twice. I can't believe people will hand the keys to their second most valuable asset over to a person they have met for the first time in their lives. I can't believe a business would dictate such conditions to their customers, the real employers, or that customers will tolerate such behavior. This doesn't even cover the fact that there are valuables in the car and I have to leave my gun in there when entering a bar and drinking. 
The food was average and the service adequate. Not enough to warrant a return."}
{"text":"Ok, so I love the servers and the atmosphere....and I used to love the menu. Im so sad they have changed the menu. I used to get the turkey sandwich on a pretzel bun, but now it is brioche, and it has changed the taste of the entire sandwich. It was a total disappointment!!! No VigAz burger either! Please change it back...this is a bummer. Ill come for drinks, but Im not crazy about the changes on the menu."}
{"text":"I come to this location out of convenience rather than preference - solely because of one employee.  

The mid 30s bartender with shoulder length blonde hair is so appallingly rude to not only the other employees, but also to the people that come here to eat & drink.  The bad temperament and lack of respect she has for everyone is baffling.  For this reason, its not likely that I will come back to this location.  

It doesn't matter if you sit at a table or the bar, ask her one thing and she will act so inconvenienced to the point where her responses are always blatantly condescending.  On numerous occasions I have asked her about menu/bar items or even assistance as she's walked by and have been left with nothing but a horrible interaction.  It's only until she remembers I am a business owner within the area that she changes her attitude towards me.   I have talked to management before about this but apparently nothing has changed. 

Again, the convenience is due to proximity for meetings and living close by, but preference would be Filmore or Uptown locations.  Stars are for the other incredibly hardworking, helpful and fun employees."}
{"text":"The food is out of this world! Get the tacos (doesn't matter what kind) and/or the lettuce wedge. Seriously. I was going to take a picture of our food for yelp but was too caught up in how amazing it all tasted. 
Chris, our server, was pretty awesome too. Very attentive but also laid back and friendly. We will definitely be back again. The musics a little too loud for my taste (we ate outside and it was a little overpowering) but it won't stop us from eating there soon!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about The Vig from a pretentious gal I know who acts like her poop doesn't stink that I figured The Vig was some high faluti'n place....not.  I was surprised to find it pretty plastic and unattractive overall.
But, the help there was very friendly and helpful when I arrived early for a function being held there.  Even the car parkers were nice.  Great help there, anyway, so I tipped more than the usual 20%.
Now when it comes to the food I ordered the Pad Thai.  Big, big mistake.  It's bad, so don't order it.  It's pretty obvious that nobody in the kitchen has ever been to Thailand or worked in a Thai restaurant even, because it was not much like real Pad Thai.  It wasn't good even tho I ate it out of hunger.
Rather than give this place a really low rating, I'll return some time and see how another item tastes.  Just avoid the Pad Thai, because my friends ordered other things and loved what they got.
And the help there are super nice which counts for something."}
{"text":"There's nothing I love more than getting pumped up at the gym, orange-tanned at the salon, putting on an age inappropriate graphic T, and jumping in my leased foreign sports car/sedan on a beeline for The Vig. It's got all the things I enjoy: dim lighting, swanky cocktails, vaguely ethnic food, servers and bartenders who are way cooler than me and know it, patrons who look you up and down then roll their eyes, and piped-in music no one actually likes. It's a great place to treat everyone else like shit...Scottsdale ambiance, with Arcadia convenience! If you're looking for a kick-ass time, and if you're 45 and still say \"kick-ass,\" you'll love The Vig, bro. 

Great patio, too. Kick-ass."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place! It's a great spot to just relax and enjoy. Their patio is awesome! I always get the \"vings\" when I go. I think they have the best wings around! they have a lot of great food for anyones likes. 
They also have a good beer selection and a well balanced wine list.  The service is relaxed yet on point. Thomas has been my server on multiple occasions, very nice guy and knows his stuff. I will be coming back again and again.  Keep up the good work!! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome evening last night. Went there for a friends Birthday; and received the royal service. Not only a free delicious desert for Birthday boy; by happen stance we met the chef who was kind enough to buy us a round. Awesome cast and crowd with live music in a beautiful setting. I don't like to recommend food but the scallops were awesome!"}
{"text":"The Vig has been a staple in the Arcadia hood for a bit. Always good food, specials, and service. With the exception on Sundays, they have been consistently understaffed for the brunch crowd, where I'm sure they'd get most of their business. My fiancé and I waited for nearly 30 minutes before anyone even walked to our table. We approached the Manager and her response was simply they were too busy. Unbelievably bad service. I actually felt bad for the waitress because there were only 2 servers for the entire patio! They made it right by comping our food but, really slooooow service and the food was bad. We will never go back"}
{"text":"One of the few bars with great tasting food. Great atmosphere and service. Being new to Phoenix I have tried multiple spots in the area and this one has not let me down time and time again."}
{"text":"So much of me wants to love the Vig and give it an amazing review. After all, it was the first restaurant I ever went to in Phoenix over a year ago when I was here for my interview. Two of my friends took me there. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. The patio is simply enchanting. 

My favorite is the vig rig that will take you home for free if you don't feel like putting up with their valet, don't feel like parking 8 blocks away because it's the closest you can get, or you are not sober enough to drive home. The ride is free and was gratefully appreciated when we were there with no car to get home.

What keeps me from upping the star level?
** Parking
** Non-memorable food
** Didn't impress me enough to make a note to come back"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Last saturday we were told no modifications on mimosa.  If you change from orange juice to cranberry it goes from $3 to $7.  Same for titos vodka special.  Bloody mary bar is $4 but if you want a tito screwdriver it is $8.  I won't be an inconvenience to them again.  There was 8 of us and the biggest regret was we didn't just get up and leave.  To many great options in phoenix to spend money where we are not wanted.  My meal was terrible everyone else said their meal was good.  Although it was over 5 minutes from the time the first and last plates were brought out.  It wasn't busy at all so they don't even have that as an excuse."}
{"text":"The Vig has always been a good spot in terms of food and drink but I will dock a point for the mandatory valet at this location. I understand parking is limited and therefore they route to valet but if you guys are going to make it mandatory it should be a complimentary valet or offer credit card services. Suggesting customers to go across the street and use an ATM for a valet service that's not warranted by customers  is a bit much in my book. Food and drink are fine but this aspect of the establishment may deter potential customers."}
{"text":"ahhhh the original Vig... it had been awhile since I've been here... I think I had a bad taste in my mouth due to the fact that last time I was here the bar gave my credit card to someone else (that person then spent more at the Vig on my card, then more the next day elsewhere). People make mistakes, I get it... The manager offered me a free bartab next time I was in to make up for it. I went back 2 weeks later and he had been let go, or left, or something.... But forgive and forget!
I love this location, due mostly to the fact that it is smaller and more intimate, and has an ACTUAL patio outside! The menu and specials are the same as the uptown Vig, you can't go wrong with most anything you order, but me, I'm partial to the burgers and wings!! The cocktail menu is very creative as well, which is always a bonus!"}
{"text":"Divey, friendly staff, not too prompt with party's however the bartenders were quick. Low patronage on a Saturday night which was good for our party of 15. Good patio vibe. Would definitely go back for a chill evening and a good old fashion."}
{"text":"I am so blown away by the way the owner handled this situation.  I have never encountered this type of customer service before in my life.  It was impeccable, gracious and I could tell that he really cares about his business."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on a Friday based on the recommendation of a friend.  Got there early enough to get a table and beat the dinner crowd.  Prices were awesome and the service was great.  Food and drink great.  The only thing that kept it from 5-stars was the parking, noise level, and size of the inside."}
{"text":"It was alright. I was there with real good peeps so it made all the difference. 

Food was pretty good. Wings were grilled and kind of different. However, i MUST say they forgot Shrimp in my friends shrimp-something-pasta-special. I mean C'mon!!! We did get free desert out of this and of cuz they replaced his dish. My own Miso Salmon was not bad but i think rice it came with was super buttered up but tasted good. And all food came out blazing fast too. 

What i was really bummed about that my Mojito as basically lemony water. I sent it back 2x till 3rd one was ok, JUST OK. I did get charged 2x for this though and did not feel like making a scene being with friends and all. 

I did not come there for a crowd, but there we some girls in tight jeans there and some dudes, and some couples. I do not care much. 

What is unacceptable is that Bar/Tavern has watered down drinks. That is BAD! I mean B A D !!! I am not a picky person but this is BS, pardon my English. AND i ended up paying 2x for this water. Bleah, doubt i will be back.

EDIT: I thought about it, compared to my other experiences i had at some other similar joints and i am bumping this one down a notch! Sorry The Vig, get your act together. Swanky decor aint cutting it.

Eugene"}
{"text":"You cant beat the atmosphere here.  The Vigan was tasty.  I am not a fan of the wings."}
{"text":"I am so very over a few of my friends who have been aware of this place but who have been hiding it from me.  I will list names at the end of this post.  But the Vig is one heck of a place to take a date for sweet potato fries and good wine!  And atmosphere...  The Vig is like so many other places that try to trend out a wine loving crowd and you will note that there is wine for days!!!! I had the Chilean Pinot Noir by the glass.  Very nice and about $13.

I want to talk though about my favorite item in the Vig...the ladies room.
Ladies, you know that this matters...  Space, sanitation, and scandal!  When I went there was no shortage of any of these.  I do wonder how it all turned out for Kelsy and James... Hold on...back to the venue...

The Vig is a mature, merlot of a place with lots of air to allow it to breathe as you inhale the masterful meals and mix and mingle with new found friends.  

I don't like the parking scenario at the Vig.  I parked in the large parking lot across the street but only realized that this was the official allotted space when I somehow detected a very small arrow on a traffic cone that said \"Vig Parking\".  You have to be kidding me. Please use the appropriate marquee to let us know where you are, Vig...

Sheree, thanks."}
{"text":"The Vig is a must when visiting Phoenix. They have raving reviews about their Bloody Mary's although I am not a fan, I swear The Vig makes me want to love them! We have been here for both brunch and dinner and both menus were outstanding. The last time we visited I ordered the turkey sandwich and an iced coffee with vodka. Both were amazing! I couldn't put the sandwich down and was slightly afraid of how delicious the iced coffee was. It had just the right amount of vodka to get you going but wasn't overpowering. The outside dining area has the perfect amount of sun and shade for a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. We will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how I haven't reviewed this location yet since I'm there semi frequently.  This is my personal favorite Vig location due to the patio. The big tree, the house kitty cat that lounges around and socializes, the comfy seating, the live music... I could go on and on.

The Vig has great happy hour deals, and on Sundays they have a bottomless mimosa special. Dangerous!!!

The food here is great. and I am obsessed with the pasole and the mac and cheese. The wings never disappoint, and their sandwiches are huge.  

This is a nice low key place to hang out, relax and have a  great drink or two."}
{"text":"Great happy hour (including both drinks and appetizers). Good entrees. Awesome atmosphere. Excellent service. Parking sucked, though. I recommend coming for happy hour so you don't have to deal with the valet. Where are we, Beverly Hills?"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour was great-awesome onion rings and fries and some of the best sliders I've ever had. The pretzel buns were excellent. Wings and fish tacos were ok and our server was great."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch before catching a flight, it's so close to the Phoenix airport. Their Greyhounds are made with fresh squeezed grapefruits - making it a delicious AND healthy midday cocktail! Hummus with warm pita bread and the steak salad were very good. Didn't have a lot of time or room to try more plates but the menu was interesting and diverse. Nice ambiance. Quite the spot for lunch on a Thursday or everyday, I hear.

I personally would have enjoyed it slightly more if they lowered the house music.  But that's just me.

I will be back fo sho."}
{"text":"I really dug The Vig.  Love the outdoor patio, complete with lounges and a fireplace.  Had a salad and some wings, both good.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Rubbish..waited 20 mins seating while no one offered anything.. meanwhile sorted a restaurant close by with more personality. Waiter arrives after schmoozing for close to 30 mins At another table (you don't have to work that hard for a tip),  asking me what I wanted, lost my interest at this place already and I walked out"}
{"text":"Second time coming there and mostly happy with the experience.   I went with my best friend and my two teenage daughters.   Had cocktails,  which were fantastic.   Then had dinner - the girls thought their food was great.   My best friend and I shared the mahi mahi dish - unfortunately the pesto was hidden at the bottom of the arugula/radish salad and the fish was cooked well but bland.   Overall,  the dosh was very healthy but super boring.   We did give feedback to the server and the manager discounted our check, which we thought was very nice.   In hindsight though,  we should have sent it back and ordered something else.  I would definitely return as the food in my experience,  has been great otherwise!   Nice ambiance and outdoor shaded dining available."}
{"text":"I love the Vig.  Good ole dependable Vig.

Great patio, kick ass happy hour specials, and bocce ball.  What more could you really ask for?  That's right, Stella on tap, and yes, they have that too.

I've heard their whole menu is good, but since I cannot get past their Trifecta (sliders) or their Chicken Fingers, I cannot comment.  But man oh man are the sliders and fingers bomb.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something very relaxing about the Vig for me.  Maybe it's their trumpet player that's there on Tuesday and Wednesday nights who's playing is intoxicating by the way.  Or maybe it's knowing that I can drink until I can no longer see and George and the Vig Rig will make sure I get home safely free of charge, just a kick ass service that the Vig provides (tips always appreciated of course.)

The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star place for me is the simple fact that their cocktails are priced a bit higher than reasonable.  If I'm paying $8 for a Ketel soda, I expect it to be tall and poured with a heavy hand, which these I'm sad to report are not.

I will however continue being a faithful patron of the Vig for all the reasons listed above, and you should too."}
{"text":"I'd bet on The Vig. (For those who don't know; a vig is the amount a bookie takes when you win a bet.  Don't ask why I know this).  While it may just appear to be another trendy gastropub in Arcadia, it does provide good food, good drinks, and a fun vibe.  And if you're looking to save some cash, Local dines has a great deal for this place.  $30 for $15 (https://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485).

I had a \"love me tenderloin\" sandwich.  The pork was cooked a little dry, but the dijonaise sauce, onions and mozzarella moistened it up and added some great favor to the sandwich.  The pretzel bun was nothing short of awesome.  And I certainly couldn't say no to a side of sweet potato fries (one of several side options).  My friend had a burger and fries which he seemed to enjoy.

Like a lot of places in Arcadia, it's interior is kind of small but there is a large outdoor seating area.  The parking lot is also very small and you really can only park by using the free valet.  It's also right next to a neighborhood, so you'll see some

My only complaint.  The server has a little less than stellar.  While he seemed nice.  He disappeared after our food arrived, and we didn't see him again until we finished eating.  Would've been nice if he checked on us once or twice in between."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio, good wine, keto friendly options!  They were accommodating and made my burger sans bun, with an order of Brussels sprouts this was a keto win!"}
{"text":"So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though."}
{"text":"I've visited twice now and have yet to eat...hey I'd rather drink my dinner.  I come from smallis Spokane Wash and this place reminds me of Spokane or Seattle.  I'm a fan of the patio, they've even hung Christmas ornaments from the trees.  Hey, I'm a chick who appreciates little touches that makes the place a bit  festive.  The service both times has been a little slow, but always friendly.  The Washington Apple shots we had were made to perfection and this is a Wash girl talking here.  We parked across the street and I found it hilarious that a 17 year old boy was guarding the lot from VIG patrons- ha!  Will return to the VIG soon for certain!"}
{"text":"I really liked the Vig.  the atmosphere was really cool, great outdoor area.  good beer selection and the food was pretty good.  not a lot of vegetarian options, but we made do with a greek salad with the chicken taken out and onion rings.  

we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place. I got the fish tacos & he got pazole. I normally don't like fish tacos but these were amazing and I took them home and ate the left overs the next day."}
{"text":"Now I know this place is no secret to anyone, but I had to show the Vig some love! This is hands down the best place to go in the Phoenix area. Not just for a great bar vibe but for amazing food! I can honestly say I've never had a bad time at the Vig, I mean how many places can you say that about? I mean NEVER have I had a bad time. The staff is amazing, especially Mich Mich, so nice they named her twice. Get her section and you will have a unique experience to say the least, and in a good way. I frequent this joint 3 or 4 times a week and it's always a blast and something different going on. Whether it be the best Sunday in town with live music and 2 for 1 bottles of wine, or their regular week night specials with different flair on it each week. 

The crowd is always great and different, eclectic. And it's always the perfect kind of busy. Botchy ball is a must and you can't beat the Vig ass Burger with a fried egg on top!!!!!! Or the Bread Pudding, don't get me started, I want it for my birthday cake!!! So if you haven't been in a while or you were just there last night like I was, get to the Vig again and again!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Vig is my favorite local bar! They have a great shaded patio with corn hole and music. Awesome happy hour too. My favorite is the Vig Nachos with carnitas. They are seriously to die for. $4 Titos all summer... can't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Love love LOVE the Vig! Yesterday was my 2nd time coming here and I must say - what a great place to end a long Sunday Funday! The live music was fantastic. The band, Elvis Before Noon, played songs all ages can enjoy. This was a big pro for the group I went with yesterday as we all varied in age. Adding drinks into the mix made it that much more fun! Thank you to the Vig's friendly staff for being so accommodating and on top of it! When you come here, you can expect to leave feeling plain ol' happy and excited to come back the next time! P.S. get the guac (duh)."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend The Vig as a lunch spot! Their mediterranean salad, fish tacos, chicken sandwich, and pad thai are all excellent! The good news- I believe they are all on the lunch special menu where you get the meal & a soft beverage for $10! It can get quite busy there, so I would recommend arriving closer to 11:00 or 11:30am, and unfortunately you will be forced to either valet or park across the street. The valet is a hysterical concept, since they literally are just parking it right in the (usually) empty lot in front of the restaurant. It's honestly more of a hassle than a benefit most of the time, but oh well."}
{"text":"Probably the best bowl of Posole that I have had In the valley. Very flavorful and best of all, they don't serve you just broth and a bone with bits of meat. It has big chunks if meat and full of flavor. For only 8 bucks... It's amazing
I'm Mexican, and from San Diego and am quite picky on my Mexican food and how I rate it. This Posole is rivaled only by my moms. And from what I'm told, the chef flys his mom in to perfect the recipe... Great for rainy days, hang overs or a good lunch. I'm a regular here and there isn't much I don't like"}
{"text":"Vigazz Burger was DELISH! I really like the vibe, the beer selection is okay. In all honesty, if this was in Tucson, it'd be my favorite place. But surrounded by places just as good, I feel it gets lost.  It was good, just not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"We love the vig and dont go enough. We are just a couple blocks away and always have such a good time when we go. 

The atmosphere is the best part about this place. You can go and hang out for a drink or app and be happy or come and hang out for the night with lawn games.

Every time we come we try to get different things, but sometimes there are just good staples on the menu like the wings or the burgers. The ramen was really good the one time I had it but HUGE! We could have split that between 3-4 people.

Bottom line is that this place has great drinks, staff and a great patio (including meow meow) and should be visited regularly."}
{"text":"Clean, hip, friendly and fun waitstaff and drinks that were just right! Check it out, but may i suggest that you try to sit in the shade inside, rather than the out in the heat and under an umbrella. There is a sweet outdoor fireplace that would be fun in the cooler months and evenings. 

Get this, there were two couples that seriously moved from table to table at least 4-5 times each due to looking for that perfect table. Too damn funny. Jokers."}
{"text":"We love the Vig and come all the time, especially on the weekends for brunch. We are sooooooo disappointed that they removed the hangover option, ie Chilaquiles. We will need to find a new place to brunch that offers them. Sad!"}
{"text":"Yumm yumm yumm!   The burgers are fantastic and yummy!

The service has always been top notch, fast and freindly.
Love the inside and outside environment.    Could do without the TVs with sports playing on them...don't we get enough plugged in entertainment in our lives already?....but I'm probably in the minority.

Kid friendly for those well behaved kids of course. :)"}
{"text":"As a fellow yelper previously stated, The Vig is not a secret to anyone. In fact, I have been here several times for beers and to enjoy the ambiance and blah blah blah. It's all been said before right? 

Well this weekend I had the privilege of enjoying lunch at The Vig. AND WHAT LUNCH IT WAS! I had no idea their food was this delicious! UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLY DELICIOUS to be exact. I mean, my mouth is still watering and it's a day later.... 

We ventured out to the patio for a beautiful Sunday afternoon. They were not too packed, and we were seated right away. After deciding on beers for the fellas, and a half priced bottle of wine for the ladies, we all agreed that it was gonna be difficult to choose an entree from their menu as everything sounded awesome. 

I ended up with the achiote salmon and chorizo arepa. WOW. asparagus, sweet corn cake with a hint of chorizo, and a wonderfully prepared piece of fish. This plate was UNREAL. Every bite was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and mixed with the asparagus, sweet corn cake, pablano chile sauce, it was the perfect bite every time. 

If you haven't figured it out already, I was flabbergasted. The deconstructed fish taco as well as the smoked pork tenderloin salad received similarly favorable reviews from my dining partners. All in all, a FABULOUS meal and now that I live around the corner and have the full monty on this place, I will be dining here often."}
{"text":"Self described as a \"modern tavern\", The Vig is a shining little sparkle of a bar in the middle of an otherwise unimpressive area. The space is open and comfortable, the atmosphere is upscale but casual, and the... oh, geez, I can't even think about the luxurious wood grains and summer-vacation-in-the-Hamptons furniture appointments, as I am overcome with an almost Pavlovian fixation with the fact that this place has Bocce ball as its main attraction. Pair almost any dated, archaic, or kitschy activity with alcohol and I'm pretty much useless to resistance, but Bocce pushes me almost to utter nirvana. There's no sign up sheet, and from the few times I've been here, perfect strangers are relatively eager to make Bocce alliances. If it's late enough, you may even be joined by the chef and owner, Doug, who encourages mischief on the court, including but not limited to: human obstacles, flagrant taunting, or ridiculous ball-launching methods. And the Vig's outstanding gin selection is a big sell. It almost feels like what the Merc Bar would be if it had a patio and didn't have over 10 years of spilled drinks and smoke damage. It's new, it's hot, and I hear the burgers aren't too shabby. I'm looking forward to checking out the dining menu, but until that happens, I'm left to encourage you to share in the unpretentious fun The Vig offers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good music, and the outside area is very chill and relaxing. We will definitely be coming back!"}

{"text":"I am very disappointed and will never return to this location again! First of all the drink my friend ordered was an Arnold Palmer but they failed to tell her it is made with a tropical tea so it didn't taste like an Arnold Palmer. Secondly, my friend ordered the Vignature Rib Eye ($26) medium and when she got her plate it was brown all the way through. When we finally got another waiter to help us (our waitress was MIA) we told him and he took it back and sent the GM over to our table and when she addressed the problem with my friend she bent over and looked her straight in the face and said \"medium to our chef is prepared this.\" When my friend stated to her that is not how she wanted it the GM was very rude and argumentative that we just said take it off our ticket. We had already waited an hour for our food so we did not have time to wait longer since this was our lunch hour. Lastly, when we were about to leave the restaurant the GM was at the exit and my friend asked for a business card or something with the GM's name on it and she stated that's me in a very unprofessional snotty way and handed her a card like good luck with that! When she first came to our table regarding the steak we did not know she was the GM.
I really feel like she treated us very rudely and unprofessional nor give two shits that we were unhappy with our food and service. What happened to serving your customer? Also, if that is how they prepare the Rib Eye the waitress should have stated medium is brown all the way through with no pink.
I have eaten at this Vig on numerous occasions and was just here last week but after the way the General Manager treated us I WILL NEVER return here again!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food here. I raised an eyebrow at the price of the poke bowl, but it was definitely worth every penny. It was more like a poke salad with avocados and veggies, but the ahi tuna was amazing and all of the ingredients were so fresh and flavorful and complemented each other beautifully.  The ginger lime vinaigrette was a nice touch. Everything we ordered was great, from the hummus to the cocktails; their take on the Moscow mule was delish. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best place to go meet friends for happy hour just get there early so you can grab a seat outside they fill up fast!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place!!!! I use to drive by it daily and never notice it, until a friend recommended going here for their $5 burger on Monday nights. Everything here is awesome! The design of the interior is very classy and the way it goes from indoor to outdoor is so cool! Food is great and staff is wonderful! Although ordering from the regular price menu is a little pricey but I'm sure it's all worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Not necessarily specific to this review, but after not being to any The Vigs in years, I kind of randomly found myself at three different locations in a span of two and half weeks. The most pleasant experience (although they were all fine) was at this one, which happens to be the location I used to frequent. 

I met some friends here for brunch. I love that The Vig has not only ventured into the brunch game, but specifically the cheap mimosa brunch game ($3 each). Although I don't drink them, the $4 Bloody Mary deal is also great (especially since they're made specifically w/Titos).  

I was surprised it wasn't THAT crowded around noon on a Saturday when we came. I met two friends, and the food & service were great. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and it came with potatoes. It was delicious! All the brunch items are are priced beyond fairly, and are good sized portions. I should also note I got the EXACT same meal at the Vig Fillmore a week later (I'm a creature of habit), and although it was fine, it was better at this location (there it fell apart and the potatoes were a little overcooked). 

I'm glad I rediscovered this place. I'm thrilled they do bruch & I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night without a reservation. We were seated quickly in the outdoor area which was cute & had laid-back loungey feel. In the middle was a fireplace blazing, and there were couches that people were hanging around on. 

Started off with an order of pork nachos which was surprisingly good. I ordered the \"Vigan... but not quite Vegan\" sandwich (grilled portabello, yellow squash, roasted red peppers, onions, Barbarella, and sun dried basil peston on ciabatta). The sandwich was delicious, but I would skip the fries. The other entrees that were ordered were the Hot Chick sandwich (grilled chicken, arugala, roasted tomato & mozzarella, spicy avocado spread on ciabatta), Flatiron Steak Torta, and The Frenchy (prime rib on a french rolla with fontina cheese & au jus). Everyone loved their meals, but it was definitely a lot of food!

The inside bar area was more of a sports bar, but it was nice that you had the option of either type of scene. Overall it's a nice, more upscale looking place to eat & drink with good service & atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good service, $3 mimosas,  delicious food and great ambiance makes a perfect Sunday brunch. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I had the steak salad. Our table shared the garlic edamame, they both were delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to.  Delicious food and a great atmosphere.  I love the Trifecta appetizer!  I order it as a meal many times.  The Spinach Artichoke dip is good too (it used to be more amazing when they had crab mixed into the mixture, so sad that they got rid of that option).
Keep an eye out for the resident Vig cat."}
{"text":"Super fun place to hang out and have dinner, I've always liked the food.  Definitely get the egg on your burger.  Definitely."}
{"text":"5 reasons to go to the vig:

1. it's outdoors w/heating lamps...which is PERFECT for AZ weather in the fall & winter...LOVE IT! 

2. it has a bocce ball court...drinking while chucking heavy balls on grass...LOVE IT! 

3. it has this (heavenly) chocolate brownie dessert...sharing is difficult...LOVE IT! 

4. it's really close to postino's...makes a great night...LOVE IT! 

5. it has the vig rig...which will shuttle your intoxicated self home (running on tips only!)...LOVE IT! 

with those 5 reasons need I say any more?"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend not knowing what I was getting into, I told her to find something and urban spoon chose this for us. 
I'm used to the suburbs so driving here I thought we where going to go to some cheap restaurant. I was both surprised and excited to say the least. To me it seemed very hidden seeing as to how I am not from Phoenix. That being said when I opened the door I was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked inside compared to its surrounding.
To start I had the ceviche appetizer ( good!) and the Pad Thai(great with chicken, shrimp was an option as well) My girlfriend contemplated between the Mac n Cheese and Carne Asada. She chose the Carne an liked it. Seemed a bit small to me, but definitely tastey. She liked it too. 
All in all I give it a very good 4 stars and that's only because I didn't try a drink. The menu seemed a bit modern Mexican but as I said it did have a Thai Pad. Drink menu did seem tasty and diverse, but unfortunately I wasn't drinking. 
Nice little gem!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the decor. It is crazy beautiful.

I also like that you can get better than average bar food until late and there are so many places to sit, you'll never have an issue with waiting.

Their food is okay, but nothing spectacular. 

I used to live in Arcadia, and I miss it every day. If I were to move back to Phoenix/Scottsdale- I would never even consider a different neighborhood. Across the board, it is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricopa County.

That being said- The Vig represents the lame element of the neighborhood. People with too much money and bad taste. I think someone else called it \"schmoozy\" and that's exactly it!

As a neighbor, we usually rode our bikes- so I can't speak to parking. Do they not still have the shuttle?

Give me The Great Escape, JTs or Postinos any day."}
{"text":"$5 burgers on Mondays?!?! Awesome. They have great pretzel buns! For some reason, we always end up on the patio, which can be a little packed, but that doesn't ruin the experience. The only downside to the place is that service can be a bit slow sometimes, but I generally attribute that to how packed it is and they seem like they need one more server.

Parking sucks here. More often than not, I've had to park across the street by the old gym (and not in the \"reserved\" spaces, they'll tow your ass!) and jaywalk.

PS If you are into douche-sighting - you're in for a big treat. Ladies with postage stamp miniskirts and dudes with over-gelled hair, spray tans, and Affliction shirts galore!"}
{"text":"Fun place with a good vibe. Deconstructed swordfish taco was delicious. However, the swordfish was a little overcooked. My wife enjoyed the lamb belly salad and our companion devoured her it's greek to you salad. Its unfortunate that even during a weekday afternoon they still require valet service, but that seems like the norm in this area. Overall, good place.  Would be back."}
{"text":"Food was alright.  We had bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer. Well balanced and quite tasty. For entrees, my husband had the hot chick chicken sandwich with coleslaw. The sandwich was one note spicy while the coleslaw was bland and over salted. I hate the best turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries. It wasn't the best I've had, but not the worst either. The sweet potatoes fries were decent with a nice level of crunch. They came with an aioli that had way too much cumin and not much of anything else. Overall, the meal was pretty mediocre. 

Staff had no personality, no smiles or casual conversation, but weren't unpleasant either. The waiter only checked up on us once during the meal. I wasn't offered a water refill until the we were walking out the door l."}
{"text":"Recommended by the hotel I was staying at, this place rocks! Open seating and fantastic food... perfect set up! I had the Hot Chick, which was a perfect grilled chicken sandwich with arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta bread. Topped that off with their sweet potato fries and you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"The Vig is a great place to stop in for a good lunch during the day. I love the fact that it has outdoor seating yet blocks out the busy streets of Phoenix. Their Ruben is delicious especially the pretzel bun version, they also have great posole and tacos. During happy hour they have decent drink specials and appetizers plus you can play \"corn hole\" aka bag toss."}
{"text":"We came for dinner, first time visit.  Small parking lot w/ mandatory valet parking at dinner time.  Arrived just as Happy Hour was nearing the end, few empty tables.  We were seated next an exit door to the patio where a cold blast of air hit us with every opening of the door.  I had to keep my coat on throughout the meal.  This table also had very poor lighting, so bad that I could not read my menu.  Worse yet was the smoke.  Yes, smoke smoke smoke in 2013.  While the dining area is non-smoking, the patio is smoke-friendly.  Several were seated on the patio in front of the fireplace and filling up the dining area with smoke.  Another exit to the patio was actually a drape left open so there was no real separation between smoking and non-smoking.  I felt like I was in a bar back in the old smoking days.  Ugh!

Our food was very good.  While I could not actually see what I was eating (refer to paragraph above), I enjoyed a chopped salad with some interesting veggies.  Hamburger was also nicely done with a side of onion rings.  Service was also very attentive and friendly.  Other reviewers have mentioned the lovely patio.  Shame that it's ruined by the smokers.  This place has a nice look to it and has a lot going right but I vote with my feet for clean air.  

Sorry Vig, you let me down and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to the Vig for after dinner drinks the other night and I had a really good time. We stopped in probably around 9:00 and were given a booth immediately. I was thrilled to see we were hitting happy hour so all the martinis were $5 a piece (awesome). Now I have not had the food here but the atmosphere was great. There was a nice mellow DJ accompanied by a trombone player and it really set a nice vibe. The couches out on the patio were spacious and comfy and I could picture myself spending a few relaxing evenings here with friends when the weather gets cooler. Granted it is a slight cheesy atmosphere with the cougars and all but what bars aren't (and I would prefer watching cougars than drunk college jocks any day). The drinks were cheap the music was great. People complain about the valet, but you can park across the street and save yourself the $5 bucks. I think I'll check it out for dinner tonight the wings and burger seem to get great reviews."}
{"text":"I like the Vigs food a lot and it's a cool place to hangout.  That aspect of my review is a 5 star.  The only negative is the parking.  It's valet only and gets backed up sometimes."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here New Year's Eve with a small group and I was excited after hearing such good things. It was around 7pm but we didn't have to wait for a booth at all which made me happy! Our waitress came out and was a bit quiet and somber, maybe she wasn't happy about working that night I don't know. I liked the inside of the place, I'm not sure if they usually keep it that dark there or if it was just for the occasion, I didn't mind at all but I know some people like normal lighting at least to read their menu. They had a bunch of balloons hanging everywhere which I thought was cute.

We started with the chicken nacho appetizer to share and it wasn't my favorite. The chicken wasn't bite size, more like two inch shredded strips and some ends were very tough. The tortilla chips were super salty and thin so the ones under any toppings got soggy fast. The flavor of the whole thing was nice overall but needs some work in the details.

I ordered the turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and I was just a tiny bit sad I couldn't get a side of the mac and cheese for an upcharge! My boyfriend got the carne asada dish that also sounded tasty.

Throughout the night we had maybe three or four men and women come to the table bringing food, drinks, refills, etc. Our actual waitress I think came three times total. I don't like this style of dining especially when the waiter or waitress doesn't even try to make an effort of being friendly or happy to serve you. Some of the gentleman bringing refills were smiling at us more than she was, and they weren't even getting tipped. This is where they lost a star from me. 

But, it would have been 5 stars because the food was awesome. My sandwich was probably the best I've ever had. The pretzel roll was soft and slightly chewy, the cranberry chutney bursting with flavor, and the coleslaw was tangy and really brought the whole thing together. The turkey was good but hard to mess up as long as it's not taken out of a plastic grocery package. I don't remember what type of cheese was used but it was also great. I had to take half of it home and even cold the next day as leftovers it was still delicious. 

The sweet potato fries were pretty good as well, hard to care about with such a great sandwich. I tried my boyfriend's carne asada dish and I liked it, there was too much tomato in my opinion and it gave it a steak and spaghetti type of flavor.

After dinner we ventured outside to take a peak at the patio. I loved everything about it, and the cat sleeping quietly on a couch cushion under the heat lamp even with all the party commotion going on was such a sweet sight. I would love to come back in the Spring maybe near sunset and have some cocktails outside."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Arizona so I was scared to try new places, but this place was really good! Try the calamari. It was delicious. I wish there was one in SD."}
{"text":"I think this is more of 3.5 star restaurant.  One of the best patios in town, bocce ball is a unique touch and is lots of fun, and you're always guaranteed good service.  So, where I think this place lacks, is their food.  I think that their menu is fine, but the quality leaves more to be desired.  However, my burger w/ fried egg on top yesterday was exceptional (A+).  If my next meal at The Vig is as good as my burger, I will step up my rating to 4-star.  Overall, fun, good place."}
{"text":"For as long as I've gone here, its always been a good go to place for friendly staff, fun games, and a relaxing place to sip on a Manhattan or two, or a beer if I'm in the mood. The food is great, I'd recommend the posole, and so is the facility. Very urban chic in the Phoenix/Arcadia area. I work at The Sanctuary just up the hill so this is a very convenient spot for an after work nightcap."}
{"text":"We were only in town for 1 night and we picked The Vig,  it was definitely the right choice. Service was great,  food quality was good and the staff was exceptional. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Phoenix spots.  Love the outdoor setting with comfortable seats and beautiful atmosphere.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to unwind after a long day driving around this desert? The Vig is the spot. Yummy food, good drinks, laid-back outdoor space for dinner with friends, a mixer, or a working dinner."}
{"text":"I love the Vig. First time coming to this location, we usually go to the one on 16th st. Came for a group brunch on saturday. I had the chorizo burrito and mannn how i could go for another right this second! My gf had the chilaquiles and the bite i had was phenomenal. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. The atmosphere was busy yet loved it because it was raining out (sat in their indoor-outdoor seating area). Definitely will be back again to try something new!"}
{"text":"I have been to two locations of the Vig. I love this place. As a gluten free nacho hang out, this is one of the best in the city. Caitlyn did an excellent job in customer service. Great mule drink as well. Another solid place to grab a bite to eat with live music on Wednesday nights by #houseofstairs band. The only constructive criticism I could have is that they have some fans in the yard to push air flow under the beautiful mesquite and tipu trees. Great job as a restaurant though."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here a few times and have NEVER been disappointed. Food is great (try the ceviche!!) and the adult beverages are priced well. I haven't heard if anybody who doesn't like this spot. Do it! You know you wanna!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a fellow yelper and it was both of our first times here.  I've heard great things about the Vig in the past, and have been meaning to stop in for some time.

The Vig is really a great little spot.  Plenty of seating, with a full bar and menu.  Staff here is awesome, and I love the way the place is decorated.  Enormous patio, decent bar seating, and plenty of great people watching.  Menu has a variety of options, and we went with the Artichoke dip with chips.  I stuck with a resling wine, and it was great.  There's TV's at the bar, along with plenty of space to move about.

Place has a great feel, and I would gladly return in the future.  The parking here is a bit tight, and I did valet for only $3.  If you don't want to do valet, you can park across the street in the lot and stroll across."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place for the second time.
I recommend the Thai sweet and spicy wings. Has a great flavor and crispy but not dry. I always get my wings extra crispy just to take the slime away from the skin. They grill and fry the wings, which is so weird but awesome.
The posole was amazing and you got so much it was well worth it. I highly highly highly recommend the posole. Filled with chucks of meat and great savory flavor in the broth. I will def be here on rainy days for that posole or any day i feel i NEED it which is EVERYDAY. The place is casual and nice for a dinner or lunch. The bartendars are awesome, as far as the service for the regular servers.. not so fond of their service. They are extremely slow and not very friendly. This place has become a new favorite and i cant WAIT to try the Mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"First impression, I was really feeling the cozy seating and live music, esp in the patio area! I ordered a poke bowl and bae got a steak salad. He said the steak salad was \"fucking delicious\". The poke was really good, BUT it was by no means an actual \"poke bowl\", instead it was poke over salad with various veggies. We also got the hummus and it was amazing. It came with hummus(duh), pita, bread, figs, roasted squash(?), and dried cranberries. I also ordered the Adulting so Hard to drink and it was pretty good - the Jameson sour was better tho! 

Overall I like the place and I will totally be back!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review for one reason only - the Deconstructed Fish Tacos.  I am in LOVE with them and when I say LOVE, I mean obsessed.  

These \"tacos\" are ready to be assembled when they come to your table with a thick, steak-like, grilled white fish, corn tortillas, salsa, black beans that actually taste good and a slaw....this slaw is what makes the dish.  It is comprised of edamame, corn, cabbage and who knows what else, but The Vig has hit it on the head.  

Now The Vig has been a neighborhood staple for years, a great place to drink and eat on the patio and meet friends for a game, but with this new menu revision, I am just loving the food.  Great job!  Now if they would just redo the dessert menu, they could have 6 gold stars..."}
{"text":"If it is Sunday, I am at The Vig.

I love Sunday at The Vig so much that I made my family come for Easter dinner.

I can get a bottle of my favorite wine (Kung Fu Girl Riesling) for $15 and sit there drinking it all day on the patio whilst listening to covers of songs that my band also covers, except they sound so much better when 1) I'm drunk and 2) The Daelins are playing them.

My only beef is that some of the douchettes that come got my squirt guns taken away. Next time I will just dump water on your head and you will shrivel up like the Wicked Witch of the West. 

Also, The Vig is singlehandledly going to fill up my new website: www.uradoosh.com"}
{"text":"Lets just say, everything tasted so delicious and I will definitely go back! After reading so many positive yelp reviews, I wanted to try this place out myself. I met up with a friend and was seated right away on a busy Friday. I ordered their fish tacos and my friend ordered a burger with onion rings. Their onion rings are seriously the best! Now lets move on to their dessert, we got their banana bread pudding. You can tell they are very generous when it comes to their desserts lol. With every bite from the bread and ice cream, it just melted in your mouth. That's how moist and juicy it was!"}
{"text":"Arizona definitely lack cool spots, but luckily they have The Vig. The venue has a nice patio area--perfect for warmer nights, but the inside tables are fine too.  


My friends brought me on a Sunday night where all their bottle wines are 50%off... which is pretty awesome. The service was friendly and the food was legit. Try the \"Good ol' Steak Salad\" and Crabmeat Artichoke dip! 

btw the valet is $3."}
{"text":"The kale jalapeño dip. So yummy but the taste lingered- mostly of very strong cream cheese,even overpowering the yummy short rib tacos. The cocktails here are incredible- tried 3
Wish they'd had live music on a Friday night. Shawn the waiter was awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for drinks and small bites on a Monday night after work. There was plenty of seating inside and out. Large patio on summer nights is a plus. We got the short rib tacos which had melt in your mouth beef, good balance of heat and flavor albeit a bit messy. We also got chips with salsa and guacamole. Salsa was the perfect amount of spice for me, for those who don't enjoy spice you may want to proceed with caution. Guacamole was good as well, fresh with veggies. Drinks were good with unique flavors."}
{"text":"I must write a retraction.... apparent \"someone\" had a problem with The Vig using the words Sunday and Funday together so it is now called \"Sunday School\" Not nearly as cool sounding, but a great day to be at The Vig none the less."}
{"text":"I've been to two other Vig locations in the Valley, both which I enjoyed very much, and this location also did not disappoint. Complimentary valet is offered (don't forget to tip!) and there is indoor and outdoor seating with heaters when it's chilly out.

Caught Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm for food) and had an awesome time! We got the sliders and the flatbread from the HH menu. The sliders were a good portion size and I loooved the bun they use! The flatbread special for tonight was the Margherita (sp?) and we enjoyed that as well.

Customer service is good and I'm always diggin the vibes here. Will definitely be back for those after work dinners to catch HH!!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Great food, great drinks, friendly staff and a very friendly crowd.  Just sleazy enough to be fun.

The food is much better than it ought to be for what is basically a really popular bar.  Tandoori chicken pizza, great salads, etc.

Oh yeah and Hoegaarden on tap!  And a very nice smoking patio if you're so inclined."}
{"text":"Nice.    I was thinking about writing a big long rant about how trendy/yuppy everyone at this place seemed to be but I thought \"hey wait a second, I'm here too\".

Great food, great drinks, maybe just a bit pricey.  For a Wednesday night this place was packed.  Wonderful outdoor patio.

Good thing you can park across the street so that way they can't see that you don't drive a Beemer and spit in your food.  

There must be some sort of shuttle bus from North Scottsdale to this place every hour or something, or how else could you explain where all these beautiful people came from."}
{"text":"I'll agree with those who find this place to be too fancy in the pantsy. It's that slick, shiny, uber-hip sort of setting where people who have shit which does not stink go to be seen having a drink. I'm going to have to disagree though with people claiming it's \"Scottsdale\" in Phoenix... strongly.

I'm sorry, but new tacky money originated in Phoenix. Just drive around the Biltmore and have a look at some of the houses that haven't been remodeled in 30 years... you can do the same in West Paradise Valley. And Phoenix continues to house many of the young financially elite in places like Arcadia and in the areas where the restored classic homes of the old arts district downtown meets up with the new \"Urban\" and \"Modern\" blocky construction that's so in fashion these days... 

I'll admit that Scottsdale - especially North Scottsdale is home to some of the biggest douchefucks and plastics around, but I'm tired of people (even I'm guilty of this) calling Scottsdale out as the douche capital of the world. Personally, I find Phoenix snobs to be a bit more insufferable because they point fingers having no clue that when they point a finger there are 3 more pointed back at them and that they are what they claim to detest.

There are plenty of douchey snobs with too much money, Affliction shirts and expensive jeans living all over the valley. They don't all come from Scottsdale - in fact, most of the Scottsdale douches hang out in North Scottsdale and don't even go to places like The Vig. 

No, the Vig is full of Phoenix douchebags and plastics when it is full... When it isn't full, I still don't like it. I had a simple grilled cheese there and it was awful. I guess wealthy people see eating as an opportunity to work hard. This sandwich was difficult to chew - a grilled cheese. What the hell is up with that? I also felt very uncomfortable eating here - the atmosphere simply wasn't very inviting. The place was pretty much empty on this occasion and wandering around outside and in, looking at all the available seating - none of it spoke to me asking me to take a load off.

Everything here looks pretty spiffy though - even if a bit pretentious. I can't say I'd ever make this joint a regular hangout of mine and to be quite honest, I regularly turn it down when it's suggested in favor of something less snobby and more comfortable. So - customer base aside, I give this place 3 marks. It's just not my style. It's nice though and if you like it, you'll be right at home with the people who go here."}
{"text":"Four for the food and 1 star for being trendy.  On Sunday there was band playing out side and for over 100 degrees its impressive to see the patio packed with people. 

At first glance you can notice the kitchen prides its self for the presentation.  At first bite one can take in the many flavors and quality food. I had the shrimp and gnocchi,  that is complimented by a flavorful pesto sauce.  

The atmosphere is crowded, everyone seems a little over dress up,  I guess I found myself in a trendy magnet, as I analyzed my desire to eat and like this place I have found out that I must be a trendy person."}
{"text":"Before I get to the rest of it - just know that if you even slightly like turkey and cranberry, you MUST have the best damn turkey sandwich I've ever paid for. The spices in the cranberry relish/chutney/sauce/whatever-you-want-to-call-it-it's-good make the sandwich. Oh, and the pretzel bread it comes on. Oh, and the turkey. It's all I can do to order something else from the menu every time I'm here. Oh, and ask for extra cranberry on the side. Just trust me.

Okay, now that's out of the way, I've always liked the place, the mood, the open area for when the weather is good, and the easy vibe. The menu is pretty good even if you're not getting the turkey - I just can't really tell you what you should get. But the wife likes what she orders every time - I just never notice it from the dregs of my cranberry bath.

Service has always been good, though this place will get busy on typical nights, so the only miracle they work is the cranberry. ;)

Did I go to heavy on the cranberry?"}
{"text":"It makes me sad to have to write this update... Almost.  Let me just start by saying that I am not all that difficult to please, although my bf may disagree.  But seriously, I waitressed and cocktailed my way through college, both in bars and fine dining restaurants which makes me almost TOO forgiving when it comes to poor service since I know how many things can go wrong that aren't particularly the wait staff's fault.  This was not the case here.    

We arrived on a Monday evening to meet some friends for dinner and drinks.  We chose the spot expressly for the fact that both my friend and I had purchased Care Cards that benefit charity while giving you a 20% discount at participating retailers during Oct 14 - 23.  The Vig claimed to be one of these businesses.  Our party turned into about 7, and I had been seated for 15 minutes before our server came over to ask if I was thirsty.  I ordered a bottle of beer.  I see her next about 10 min later when she is delivering food to the table, although my beer is no where in sight.  She asks my companion if they want another, I politely let her know that I still had not received my first.  ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by, and my beer is finally delivered to the table.  In the meantime, my food had arrived.  They changed the menu and took my beloved seared sea scallops off and replaced them with Pad Thai (WTF?! there is no shortage of Thai offerings in the neighborhood) but they did add a few more healthy salads which is nice so I ordered a deconstructed fish taco salad.  This was the standout of the evening, and the reason for the 2nd star.  It is one of the best salads (healthy) I have had in recent memory.  Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish, crunchy salad with cilantro, salsa, guac, and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side.  

As the evening winds down, we ask for the check.  My friend had presented her Care Card when she first arrived with her husband, yet when the waitress brought the bill, there was no discount taken off.  Fine.  We see her about 5 min later and remind her.  10 min later she comes back with a revised bill with a whole $4.20 taken off.  Our check was $200.  I was no math major, but come now. After another 5 minute wait, I asked her why only $4 was taken off, she informed me bc only what the Care Card holder ordered had been discounted.  This was also bullsh!t because my friend ordered more indeed.  I asked to speak to the manager, and informed her that I also had a card.  Nowhere on the exclusions did it say: will only discount on the items the card holder orders (the nerve!).  We are all one party, with one check - and if you are participating in a charity benefit- effing do so!  They are providing you with free advertising and 7 customers you would not have had otherwise on a Monday night!  I have to use the restroom, so my friend says she will speak to the manager.  I walk back to the table to see a brown haired dude (the manager) rolling his eyes as he walks away assuring my friend he will \"take some more off\".  We wait another 10 minutes.  I wish I was joking.  She comes back and presents the bill with $15 taken off the total.  I have never experienced such poor service and attitudes.  Sadly, this was not the first time this has happened in the year that I have lived down the street and probably frequented this place 2-3 times a week at my peak infatuation with the Vig.  But just like most relationships, what starts out all champagne and roses eventually turns into complacency and laziness which is why I am dumping the Vig.  It's not me, it's you.  You may look cute on the outside, but your personality sucks and I certainly won't introduce you to anymore of my friends.  I will never date you again, and I vow the only time I will ever contact you  in the future is if I'm already drunk and decide to meet up with you late night, but it won't mean anything."}
{"text":"I love the Vig, but I prefer the Uptown location to this one.

I've only been here for Sunday Funday. How can you say no to 1/2 price bottles of wine? My mom and I shared a bottle last weekend for $12. Plus there is a band on Sundays, and they are awesome! They play great covers (Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, Gin Blossoms), and throw in some originals every now and then. The music is also at the perfect volume, so you don't end up having to shout to have a conversation. The patio is the place to be, but it gets super packed. We ended up just hanging out by the outside bar because it was going to be an hour wait for a table outside.

But the crowd... at the very least it makes it for good people watching. It's pretty much D-Bag city. Last weekend, a guy had a huge Cadillac tattoo on his arm rocking some type of Affliction looking shirt. Enough said."}
{"text":"Great place, good food, good atmosphere. It's on the loud side. So it's not the place to go for conversation if you don't feel like yelling at each other. There's a fantastic patio with fire place and twinkle lights. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"The Vig is a great place for lunch (I've never been here for anything else). I always order the lunch special - but note that you must get here before noon to order it (lame). The fish tacos are amazing and have me leaving extremely satisfied each time."}
{"text":"The weather is beautiful at night now and this patio is a great chill. I believe I will even become a bocce challenger much like the Romans would do. It is a pretty fun sport.

I loved sitting under the trees and night sky over the weekend, sipping Mai Tai's. The DJ music on hard drive was really good for me. The Adirondack chairs are super comfortable and the coffee tables excellent to put your feet up or even sit on to face your date.

The giving back to the community programs behind the Vig are always a good bet. Currently they are doing a back to school contribution for a few eligible schools. 15% of your bill during September, The Vig will donate to Hopi Elementary, Tavan Elementery, Ingleside Middle, St Terisa, St Thomas and Christ Lutheran. 

Plus the bonus round. The school that earns the largest rebate gets $500 in gift cards, another cool auction item for the fundraisers. Good luck you guys! Ends Sept 30, there's still time. Don't forget to tell your server which school you like, it's open to everyone."}
{"text":"love love love this place! the patio is amazing! comfortable seating and musters/heaters make it a 365 attraction. great cocktails, wine, and beer selection and enticing food! check out \"the hot chick\"!

parking is very difficult but they have a valet. :)"}
{"text":"I'm sure this may have been talked about in the many reviews here but I feel like this is important enough that I start out with this.  **The parking**.  This location has complimentary valet and the valet company uses the entire restaurant parking lot for this.  If you wish to have your car parked in the restaurant lot, you will need to use the valet.  Now there is no upfront charge for this service (complimentary after all) but as with all valet service, a tip is expected so plan accordingly.  If you wish to not use the valet at all, you will need to park at the shopping center across the street.  It is a short walk and is something I will do next time I visit here.

Last night was my first time here and it was for my friend's birthday dinner.  The group of us ordered the bruschetta and the artichoke, kale, jalepeno dip for apps.  Both were delicious but the bruschetta was my favorite.  The toppings for the bruschetta tasted fresh and the bread was nice and crisp.  The dip came out very hot and is served with both pita bread triangles and tortilla chips.  I liked the dip better with the tortilla chips... I felt like it tasted a lot better with that instead of the pita bread.  I was afraid the dip would be spicy with the jalepeno but it was surprisingly mild.  Maybe I got lucky and everyone else ate all the jalepenos for me!

After seeing all the pics for the short rib tacos on here, I was sold on ordering them.  For the most part, I did like it but the slaw not so much.  Maybe too much vinegar?  I can't really describe it.  

This location (actually all of their locations) are really far and out of the way for me.  This is not somewhere I would choose to go to on my own.  If I were to be invited out to this place again, I would consider coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty trendy and a good place to hang out.  I have been to both Phoenix Locations and enjoyed the ambiance of the facilities. The staff is great starting from the valet to the wait staff.  

The food is pretty good but not 5 star quality.  I had the fish tacos, which were good, some in our group had the bloody marys but they had to doctor them up themselves.  Again I can not complement the wait staff who were always right there.   I was the designated driver and my tea glass was kept full, which is not always easy.  

I love the decor of the restaurant.  It has both indoor and outdoor dining.  We started out, but it was a little windy, so we moved inside.  But otherwise the outdoor dining would have been nice."}
{"text":"I dig the Vig. Good food and a great atmosphere/patio. If you like Bocce Ball, then you should definitely check it out, but go soon before it starts to warm up again and be sure to take the Vig Rig home if you're blasted."}
{"text":"Patio area and food is the big draw for me. They got a corn hole area outside which is perfect to entertain both adults & kids. Service staff can be hit/miss but will admit on this day they were accommodating. Our group has the fish tacos, chi, guac & salsa, Vig Azz burger, Posole, sliders & mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I gotta say, the difference between The Vig on a chill night and The Vig on a packed night is, well, night and day.  They'd might as well call it The Zoo on your average Fri-Sat-Sun.

First, on a packed night you have to run The Gauntlet to get from the front door to the back patio.  It's about five feet wide from bar to booth, and reeks of Hidden Fantasy.  I have never before had to contort my elbows and shoulders in so many ways to avoid brushing up on fake titty.

Relief hits you when you make it back outdoors.  To the romantic patio, with its fireplace, cozy chairs and christmas-lit desert trees, that brings out the worst in every horned up yuppie jackass.  I've never seen so many horrified young women pulled into laps on couches before.  Maybe the half-priced wine all day has something to do with it, but by 8pm Sunday that patio reminds me of the reptilian scene from Fear and Loathing.

But damn if the place ain't great on a normal night.  I've brought dozens of friends here from out of town and they leave thinking Phoenix is actually a town chock full of swank bars with hip decors.  The food's pretty good when they have time to get it right, too.  Staff's great.  Just catch em on a slow night."}
{"text":"Best HappY HouR I've ever been too! No restaurant will ever live up to these chicken wings!!! We also had hummus with fresh veggies and seasoned soy beans! We were even made happier by the $4-5 prices and large portions that we did not need dinner.  My only compliant is the drinks didn't taste like there was any alcohol in them...so bring your own --Jussss' kidding. 

Our service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Alright, it takes a lot for me to give a joint 5 stars, but bravo Vig, you did it.  The place is classy, chic and cozy- something you would imagine in a more posh neighborhood, however its just a neighborhood lounge. Plasmas with all the games, attentive bartenders, a cool crowd, lounge-y music, great fire pits and a nice back patio (my only concern is when its 5000 degrees outside in the summer, what happens?) 

Another bonus to this place??? BOTCHI BALL (spelling?). I have never seen that in my life but it was quite entertaining.  What better than get drunk and then exercise under the stars?! Genius.

Why this place is really a 5 star joint and not 4... the drinks. They are so cheap! I bought 3 rounds- beers, premium top shelf drinks and the tab was only $35!!! Phoenix is the land of milk and honey of cheap prices!

DO come to The Vig. It is awesome!

BTW, kudos to the lady at the end of the bar wearing sunglasses all night. You reminded me of Chyna the wrastler. Talk about celebrity sighting... muhahaha."}
{"text":"Amazing outdoor patio. Love the atmosphere. Done a good job making it look awesome. Usually have live music. The Bloody Mary bar is a great deal, and bottomless mimosas are even better!! I don't even remember what I ordered but I know everything our party ordered was amazing and I'd go back in a heart beat. Think we sat and hung out for 4 hours just relaxing. Don't think the patio is dog friendly but that would make it that much better. Overall a must stop in phoenix area"}
{"text":"Dear Vig Hater,

I went back to The Vig for happy hour a few weeks ago, and I'm going to have to officially declare my disagreement with you. Even thought it was ridiculously crowded (and we had to wait for a seat on the patio at a mere 5 p.m.!), I thought the happy hour scene was dynamic and exciting; people were having a lot of fun, and the whole place felt alive. Plus, the well drinks were really cheap and the duck & mushroom quesadilla I had was really well-executed and satisfying. I would return here for lunch or happy hour in a second, and that my friend, makes for a five-star experience. 

Christine"}
{"text":"The Vig seems like a restaurant you'd find in LA. You drive your car there and there's vallet too. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5

What I got: 
Hot Vings. Rating: 4/5
Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken. Rating: 4/5
Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake. Rating: 3/5
Sweet Potato Fries. Rating: 3/5
Arcadia Burger. Rating: 3/5

Mojitos. Rating: 3/5
The Mojitos weren't the best I had. I feel as if it was missing a key ingredient to give it a great factor. I even added more mint leaves to it, and it just didn't have that wow factor. 

The hot vings were the most memorable part of the meal. Next would be the Flatbread Pizza. I shared all that food with a total of four people. 

Overall, its a nice place to go and dress up at. The food is a bit pricey, but that's what you get for heading to the city. I'd say this would be a generic place you could take for a Friday night date."}
{"text":"Good Food, very Upscale and Ambiance. I had fish Tacos and would give 2 thumbs up..."}
{"text":"Average visit...weighing in on the food, service, and atmosphere. The food was great $5 burger and the pazole was yum! The only thing that ruined it for me... THE SERVICE!! Our waitress sucked! She was so stuck up and un-engaging. Like she was doing us a favor. Anywho try the pazole."}
{"text":"Since my life revolves around food - this is one of few places that serves shoestring fries, as far as I know, so I'll continue coming here until hell freezes over.  

I've been here multiple times with massive groups of people.  Everytime, the staff has been extremely helpful and pleasant to be around, even when I'm sure it's a pain doing the check at the end.  Ambience is very relaxed in the outdoor patio/lounge.  Get some friends, some great drinks (awesome selection), and relax on the comfy furniture outside.  

Oh, sometimes there's also a cat (owner's?) that hangs about outside on the weekdays.. some people are bothered by it but I thought it was kind of funny that it just ignores everybody and does a full-body layout on one of the ottomans."}
{"text":"The Vig is fantastic! Delicious mac & cheese, get with broccoli for extra fun (: 

Love the vig!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me to a date here and it was a nice time. I tried the pozole and it was very well prepared. Their ruffino moscato was delicious. Very trendy spot and great drink menu. Very surprised to find that their pricing was economic. All dishes were well presented. Their ceviche was a treat as well. We ended the night with banana bread pudding and more moscato. We had a great time and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"A great place to land for happy hour or brunch. I usually go to the uptown location, but this one is just as good. 

By the way, I actually did previously go to the bar that came before the Vig at this location: It was the sort of place that made Philthy Phil's look like the Ritz."}
{"text":"Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, who knows, I am not the management :-)"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night (Saturday). Awesome experience all around!

Everything from the valet parking ($3), to the inside decor and bar, and the incredible outdoor patio (where we ate) was perfect. The outdoor patio has an awesome fireplace and a boccie court! Great seating arrangements for dining or drinking.

The menu is very low key and affordable, mostly consisting of salads and sandwiches. We started with the hummus plate for an appetizer - it was served with two kinds of hummus and chopped cucumber and tomato. My Pastrami on Pumpernickel with coleslaw was yummy, and her chopped chicken salad / wrap combo hit the spot.

The cocktails looked great and the crowd is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day, and was dissapointed. The atmosphere and patio were great and so was the service. Reminded my of a Chelsea's/Postino type of place and had the same clientle. The only proble was the food. I had the \"hot chick\" with onion rings. For a $12 sandwich, it lacked chicken, flavor and came with soggy bread and soggy onion rings. How hard is it to make onion rings? thinking of them almost makes me sick. However, i would go back, possibly for drinks and appetizers. Who knows, maybe they were just off that day. I guess i just had higher expectations. And why the need for Valet here? it seems crazy."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch but it was a weekday so they don't have a brunch per say.

We sat indoors and it was very dark. It was a little chilly that day so we didn't sit outdoors and I kind of regretted it. 

For most of our lunch we couldn't figure out who our server was. There was a lady who got us water. Then another lady who took our order and then a lady who brought our food and drinks and checked on us. It was quite confusing. 

I ordered the Mac and cheese which was a LARGE portion. It was supposed to come with a drink but the waitress never asked for what we wanted and we had to ask the other lady for soda after checking the menu to make sure.. then she walked away quickly and came back a few minutes later to ask what soda we wanted. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich which he liked with the sweet potato fries which were TASTEY!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first 2 stars review.Ok food Was great but not everything is about food.The service could of been much better is our Sunday FunDay so we appreciate smily faces and that was missing!The boss boy the waitress and the hostess-everyone was just bland. Ultimately we treated more like an annoyance at not like customers that were coming to spend money with them. i will recommend the management reinforce smile :) Its so simple and it makes everyone day!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, never too packed and the patio has misters, a fire place and the Christmas lights are so cute. The music is loud but not so much you cannot carry on a conversation. We tried the Bombasiled and it was a good, fruity drink that tasted nothing of alcohol. The staff is friendly and we love the trivia cards on every table."}
{"text":"Service was cool. I was excited that they had a good Red Sangria! Started out with the guac & chips for app. They gave a hefty serving of guac which was definitely nice.

For entrees I got the Arcadia burger + fried egg, & my fiancè had the best turkey sandwich. My burger was great, minus the fact that my medium well I asked for was a little pinker than it should've been. 

I did feel a little rushed out of the place, but to my own fault, we did go mid afternoon on a Sunday.

Will probably be back, may try a different location since they are throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Their Greek salad is perfection!!! Great beer selection! Nice patio and free valet!! Despite having to navigate through downtown Phoenix, this place is pretty great!"}
{"text":"This is like a bar/lounge except with great food, I'm a fan! Went here late after another Suns game. The boyfriend's brother plays for the Suns so he is keen on all the good spots open late. We enjoyed a great meal while watching highlights of the game (and himself) on the big screens, pretty cool. Best of all, it was dimly lit so nobody really bothered us."}
{"text":"If I were to review The Vig on food alone I would say its in the 4 star range.  The food was excellent. We went here for dinner for a going away party and I really did enjoy the meal.  I had a BBQ pork torta with sweet potato fries.  The fries were warm and they came with a special sauce.  The Torta was excellent mix of southwest and American.  It really was quite tasty and the price was good also.  

Now the reason for the 3 star.  There is a strange vibe in this place.  There seems to be a lot of older guys and young women here.  The parking lot is full of Mercedes/BMW/Land Rovers so I am guessing that its a great place for older men to meet young women or vice versa.  If this is your type of thing then by all means this is the place.

Overall I say the best part of this place is the people watching."}
{"text":"Dined here two years in a row while visiting for Spring Training. The ambiance is awesome, and it's so great to sit outside on those warm Arizona nights. I got the wedge salad the last time, it was not great, but everyone else in my group enjoyed their meals. We can't wait to come back next year!"}
{"text":"Awful!  First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.  

I went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.  

A woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, \"I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went\".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.  

At this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.  

There are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?  Needless to say, the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.  Oh, and the people that go here: I might as well stay up in North Scottsdale, it's the same yuppie, \"I'm so important\"/30K millionaire crowd that has taken over what used to be the great city of Scottsdale.  It's sad, I really wanted to like this place and it has the potential to be fabulous...if they just start over.

Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"The Vig is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or late-night for some damn decent food, served up relatively quickly, and with a good variety of dishes to boot.

We showed up around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and there was no wait, seat yourself. We chose to sit outside because the music was just BUMPING inside and we wanted to at least be able to hear ourselves over dinner. We found a nice booth with plenty of room for the four of us, and a waiter (Scott, who was very nice) stopped by within a minute or two, max, to tell us waters were all ready on the way and could he get anything else for us.

I had the Love Me Tenderloin, which was this lovely beef dish served with these fantastic marinated onions & mushrooms, and this wonderful cheese-y potato dish of happiness. Overall, a good experience, and decently priced.

My compatriots had the salmon dish, which was cooked spot on and served with an awesome corn-mash chorizo side, and the potato pancake, which was equally good.

We cleaned our plates, played with some of the Trivial Pursuit cards on our table, and enjoyed a few beers. 

Overall, a pleasant experience. Our server was there when we needed him and kept our drinks topped off, and everything came out fine (minus a misheard-for beer early on that was quickly resolved).

I was a bit disappointed that the patio didn't have any misters at all, as it was damn hot if you weren't out under the terrace where they have some cool ceiling fans, and the music was really quite loud even outside, though, to be fair, I think the booth we chose was right under a speaker. It was a live DJ, so I understand the virtue of keeping things up there, but it's a bit rough to have to shout to people across the table.

All in all, we'll probably be back, and I like that their late night menu is served through 1 am.

(Oh, bonus: they have lawn games on this stretch of lawn outside at the patio, including bocce ball!)"}
{"text":"I actually like this original Vig better than its uptown counterpart.  The outdoor area is definitely my favorite part and its much bigger than the Vig Uptown.  Although its a popular spot I have always had luck finding a seat outside and under a heater lamp! There is always the Bocce ball track too if your conversation runs dry :) 

Sweet potato fries are amazing as is everything I've had to eat there! Try to make it on a Monday for the burger and fries $5 deal!  There really is no point paying 7 bucks for Chipolte! 

I really vibed with the DJ last time I was at The Vig.  It was like every song he plucked off my Top 25 Playlist and dedicated to me. (In the least narcisisstic way possible).  

Only downfall is the parking. They do their best in the awkward corner lot but you are pretty much forced to valet. Good thing the Vig is always worth it! 

*Feel free to keep the drinks coming too because the Vig Rig will take you home*  So convenient!"}
{"text":"I've never reviewed The Vig?!!?!?  That's so strange.  
Well, by this time in my life, I've eaten pretty much everything on the menu and continue to come back.  So the food is good.
The patio is awesome.  Go on a slower night, say Monday or Tuesday, and find some chill musicians setting the mood with plenty of space to spread out.  
Sunday afternoons are a packed happy mess and you don't really get to experience the awesomeness this place really has.
If you don't want to valet, just park in the giant parking lot across the street and take the shoelace express on over."}
{"text":"I took my wife to the Vig on 40th St for the 1st time on Sept 26 Mon and thn again the next day on Tues Sept 27th.  It was my 2nd and 3rd time.  We both love this place.  We've had great service, food and we love the ambiance.  We parked across the street both times in the strip mall.  On Monday, we went between 6pm and 9pm for the cheeseburger fries special.  This hamburger is on a pretzel bun and u can either get regular fries or the sweet potato fries, both great.  On Tues, we went during happy hour between 3pm and 6pm.  There are about 7 food items on it and we ordered the buffalo wings and the fish tacos and both were excellent.  We also tried the pork posole and that was excellent.  We would also like to thank our server Jessica and manager Thelma for making our Tues visit great.  Although I think their regular prices are kind of high, their happy hour and aftr 6pm specials are 2nd to none.  I believe Mon thru Friday, besides their happy hour, they have a different food special when happy hour ends starting at 6 to 9 p.m.  This is our go to place now.... we love The Vig on 40th."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out with friends. The food is great and so are the drink. They also have corn hole so if you're the type to get up on play that's also available. 

My only concern with this location was the service. It took a while for anyone to acknowledge us when we entered the restaurant and the service was slow. We visited Saturday afternoon and they should have been better prepared. 

Overall the food was a 4 star but their service definitely was disappointing."}
{"text":"I am new to the city.  As I am getting around to meeting people and socialize I seems to always suggest going to the Vig.  The first time that I went was back in Dec.  At first I was unsure of where this place was at.  That was the first thing that I liked about the location.  It is so unexpected. and once inside you get lost in the atmosphere.

I love the food there.  I had the Tacos the other night small, but packed with great flavor and filling at the same time.  My drink never stayed empty with i really like.  I really like the out door space that the Vig has,  even when you are seated inside I sitll feel a part of the patio and considering the great weather that we have here in AZ thats its plus. 

The over all feeling of the place is somewhere that you want to be.  People are talking,  music playing, the staff is happy and energetic.  I feel that this place could end up being my local watering hole."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick beer.  Didn't have a chance to try their food, but it smelled and looked amazing.  I'll have to give it a shot next time.  Bartenders were very attentive  even though they were packed.  Great looking outdoor patio too."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time. Now I'm questioning if I want to come back.our food took over 45 minutes to come out and all I got was a mimosa comped... Used to love this place but the service seem to be getting slower and slower.. Too bad, used to be my favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"When you've got an itch for something better than the norm- The Vig is it. If you enjoy salmon, I highly recommend the Achiote Salmon. It was perfectly cooked without being fishy and the sweet corn cake was divine. Topped with a fresh mango salsa, this meal couldn't have been any better. Mark and I  shared a bottle of the Sextant Zin and it didn't disappoint. Sextant was rich and jammy, complimenting the entree perfectly. The vibe there was cool, and low-key--not over the top, like so many places hedging Scottsdale. Outdoors on the patio at The Vig is the epitome of relaxation when the temps are lower and the heat lamps are burning."}
{"text":"Insanely beautiful wait staff serving insanely adequate but not too overwhelming food.

Seriously though, the girl working the bar had the entire restaurant staring. Good job in the hiring dept."}
{"text":"So happy to have such a \"cool\" place so close to home. Love the atmosphere and food is great. Big selection. Not in love with the confusing valet situation they have but everything else is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I went to The Vig twice this weekend, and both times it was awesome.  On Sunday, I went for breakfast after going to the gym.  We sat outside on their gorgeous outdoor patio, right next to the fire.  The food was amazing (I had a sandwich, even though it was breakfast time - the sliced prime rib with aus jus - YUM), and the service was great.  On Monday, I spontaneously decided to hit it up for happy hour, and had an equally excellent experience.  \"My\" table by the fire was open, so we sat there again! Happy hour was awesome (wings were delicious, as were the sliders) Bonus - on Monday nights, you can get a full burger with fries (regular or sweet potato) for only $5!  They have bocce ball outside, and even the interior feels open and airy.  I definitely want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place makes me glad I'm not single, but I have met a few interesting people there.  Nice outdoor patio, food is average, drinks are ok.  Good place to gawk at the beautiful people."}
{"text":"Nachos were huge, but soggy (mostly the good kind). The southwestern salad was tasty but incoherent. Great ambiance. Parking seemed like it would be a pain, but we just parked on a residential street a block away. The locals didn't seem to think this was a viable option."}
{"text":"This review is for the McDowell Ranch location.  First of all, the restaurant itself is beautiful and I really love the outside patio area.  Last night was my third time there and on all three occasions my party and I sat outside.  And on each of these occasions we had the same experience of loud kids running around unsupervised.  They were climbing on the walls which post clear signs saying Please Do Not Climb.  All this while the parents were sitting around their respective tables drinking and being totally oblivious to the havoc their children were wreaking on other patrons.  And none of the employees seemed to want to deal with it either.  It was not an enjoyable, relaxing experience we had hoped for.  Ok, now the food.  My first visit there I ordered a grilled romaine salad with creamy feta dressing and it was wonderful.  By the second visit, maybe three weeks later, it disappeared off the menu, so I ordered the Asain Chop Salad.  It was just ok.  Last night I ordered the Cobb Salad (I am a salad person) WITHOUT the blue cheese....I hate blue cheese...but it came with blue cheese, which unfortunately, I did not notice immediately since it was evening and it also had chopped egg on top which hid the cheese.  I did not send it back because it had already taken forever to get our dinners and I was in a hurry to get out and away from \"McDonald's Playland\".  So I picked off as much of the cheese as I could but I could still taste it.  I also ordered grilled salmon on the salad and that came out tough and dry....severely overcooked.  My husband said his burger was just ok, and he was just as disgusted as I was that we had to witness Romper Room whilst eating.  Parents, please either leave your kids at home or make sure they behave appropriately if you do bring them, not only to be curteous to other diners, but for the safety of your own children.  I witnessed many near-accidents from falls to running into waiters with trays of hot food.  Not to mention this place could be considered easy pickings for a child predator since parents are not paying attention and there is ideal access to parking lots and streets on all sides.

I will not be back for a fourth visit."}
{"text":"I use to love the Vig, but sadly my last few visits were awful. I went for lunch today and ordered the Ribeye.  What a mistake.  I ordered the steak medium and it was well done and had a huge end section that was all fat.  I had already been there for some time and the service was pretty bad. Our waitress kept disappearing.  At one point we had to get another server to help us.  I did not have time to have it redone.  I asked that it be removed from my bill.  The GM Cheri came to the table and told me that \"that's what medium is to my chef\".  The entire steak was cooked through solid brown all the way.    What kind of manager comes over and tells you, you are wrong about an obviously overcooked steak?  It's pretty universal.  There were three in my party and it took about 40 minutes for food to even come out.  We were there over an hour just trying to have lunch  I know, I know....they were cooking the hell out of that steak!!!  I also know, I should have never ordered steak at the Vig! The time before that they served me raw hamburger that I actually wanted cooked well.  They took it in the back and nuked it, and brought me back the same plate with crusty ketchup on it.  Go figure from raw to \"OMG who would do this to a steak?\"  I will never go to this restaurant again.  The GM is something else.  I wish I knew who the owner was.  As a business owner I couldn't believe what a threat to revenue this crew and bad food is.  I would clear the deck at that place and start with some new staff (to be fair, there were servers who seemed to be great, just not ours)  ones who know a MEDIUM steak.   Here's hoping someday this turns back in to the cool little place it used to be.  Oh and just a side note, you should inform someone about the fruitty Iced Tea if they order an Arnold Palmer it makes a difference...just sayin' :)"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. I will eat here again and I recommend The Vig for others too. The only downside was the \"complimentary valet parking.\" I prefer to park my own car and I didn't see that option here. I ended up parking down the street and walking up."}
{"text":"Popped in for Sunday brunch and had the hangover helper which is exactly what I needed.  It is chilaquiles rojos, with scrambled eggs, carne asada, red salsa, tortilla chips, queso cotija, sour cream and pico de gallo and a over easy egg on the top.  Man it was spot on and I instantly felt better however suddenly I wanted a nap.  I was glad all worked out because I tried to go to Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast and the lines were huge so obviously it was meant to be."}
{"text":"I love the Vig. Come here as often as I can on weekend nights to sit back and enjoy a little deep house music and some Moscow Mules. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate a friends' birthday. I really liked hanging out on the patio. It has a ton of tables and a fireplace and heaters. The outside bar is kind of limited in selection, but the DJ was good. The inside bar was busy, but could still order drinks in a reasonable amount of time. I tried the pork nachos. They were decent, not wonderful. Good selection of beer and wine. Overall this place is pretty nice, dress appropriately."}
{"text":"The Beautiful Carin and I are collaborating on a writing project.

The project is titled \"Spanxx, the Unenthusiastic Stripper\"...it will be beautifully illustrated, in delightful and fanciful watercolor's, designed to inspire the imagination:)

It's a children's book:)

The first of series, really, about \"Spanxx\", a delightful \"seasoned citizen\" and her misadventures trying to make a living in this economy:)

We took a collaborative meeting at The Vig last Saturday.

I know what you are going to say, after reading my earlier review, you are going to ask, \"Why would you go back to the Vig, Donald?\"

I would ask the same question...the answer,  is that one of the owners of The Vig sent me a note, apologized for the problem, assured me that what I experienced was not their policy, and asked me to give them another try...and he was so darned nice about it (and really, he was even nice about my review, which wasn't especially nice), that I couldn't say \"no\".

I took Carin (who had no firsthand knowledge of either The Vig, or my review, although she had heard that the place was very cool from some of her modeling and acting buddies).

We hit The Vig at what is likely the very best time to visit...early Saturday afternoon and got ourselves situated in one of the outdoor booths...a warm breeze was blowing and the martini's were flowing:)

It's a different atmosphere altogether on a weekend afternoon...no cigarettes, no raging hormones (or at least if they are raging, they are doing so quietly...much like \"Spanxx\":)

We ordered a hummus and baba ganoush appetizer, a Vig Cobb salad and the Pork Torta, as well as the aforementioned marti's and we spent a couple of hours having lunch and cocktails, discussing our project and laughing and discussing and laughing some more!

And it was really nice...I mean really very nice.

I asked Carin what she thought about The Vig, and she said \"this is wonderful...it should be our \"go to\" in Arcadia\"!

So I showed her what I had written, and she said, as all supportive spouses should \"You must have misunderstood\"...meaning me...meaning that I was likely, even probably, wrong:(

Well, I suppose I could have misunderstood...I may have misjudged...I am very busy solving very complex problems in my mind on a pretty much constant basis...and I had just been to my philosophy discussion night, so I was thinking about all that stuff...probably:)

Oh what the hell...I was charmed by the afternoon version of The Vig, and since Carin likes it, I know that we will be frequent visitors.

 I'm OK with that...the food was good, the service was good, the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up.

It takes a big person to admit they made a mistake...and humility prevents me from pointing out that I am a giant among men for theoretically admitting that I might have erred in my previous assessment of The Vig.

A 2 star swing seems like a lot, but as I said in my earlier review, The Vig was at least A-OK, even at night...on a lazy Saturday afternoon, chatting, laughing, drinking and eating with the great love of my life, The Vig is easily a 4 star experience:)"}
{"text":"I have been to the Vig a few times, and I I think it is hit or miss.  It is not a blow your taste bud experience and  I do think it is a tab bit overpriced for what you get.  However, for a great happy hour, drinking with friend taking advantage of Arizona weather this is  a great place.  

The atmosphere is modern but a little laid back, but then again it would have to be if you have boccie ball!  The patio is were it is at, and I think there are more tables outside then inside.  There is also an additional bar in the back.  

Food:  Overall the food is good, it is no blow your mind food but there are some strong items, I have had the following:

Apps:
Salmon plate - I really liked this
Crab and Artichoke dip - They use Crab with a C not with a K :)
Dinner:
Carne asada on a potato pancake - This is my fav dish here, bug fan of cotija cheese and gives the dish a great balance
Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa - very nice spice
Steak Salad - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish, I think the salad dressing was great but the steak was overcooked and not enough cheese

I haven't tried the brunch but I am interested in what they offer.  I think that if you are looking for a chill outside bar with modern bar food the Vig is a fantastic choice.  

The valet is a bit overkill - I can walk 10 feet to a front door, I think the valet comes into play because sometimes it is hard to get a parking spot, really is a bit unnecessary but then again I guess they are creating jobs."}
{"text":"We chose this place for my Birthday.  Everyone had eaten there before but me. We wanted the live music but found out that they alternate between days during the summer, so there wasn't any live music. Still it was a very good night, the food was delicious, and they even comped a drink for my birthday.  The Pad Thai with shrimp was delicious with a little kick of heat.  Mac and cheese is amazing!  The chicken wing appetizer is always a good bet."}
{"text":"Had three hours to kill before catching plane back to KC and had my nephew and his wife pick a spot close to airport.  The Vig was their choice.  It was Sunday at 4pm.  $3 Margaritas that were great!.  I had Posole.  Others has Phad Thai and Mac & Cheese.  Food, service, and atmosphere were very nice.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Cheesy Tater Tots...need I say more? The Vig offers a handful of different delish food items to choose from. They are expanding and just opened up a new location in McCormick Ranch that offers a late night menu. However, at their Uptown location my favorite drink on their signature cocktail menu is Take Bethany Home. It's refreshing and not overpowering, the perfect combination of ingredients. I highly recommend visiting The Vig closest to you!"}
{"text":"Great food!!  What a variety of options and all are fantastic. At my table, I tried the short rib tacos, chorizo burger and pad Thai. All were fantastic!!  And the cocktails... From a simple drink to a complex mixology drink, they do it all!!  Great service. Great environment!  And a neat Patio too!!"}
{"text":"Great on Sundays and for outdoor seating with live music. Service is excellent and the crowd is very Posh. Great for a Date and some wine"}
{"text":"this place is growing on me. i wasn't a big fan at the beginning thinking they cater to the yuppy crowd that wants to be seen. i still think that's the case, but i think people truly go for the atmosphere and good food. the vig cobb is really tasty and you just can't go wrong with sweet potato fries...my weakness! the interior is really cool and creative and the vibe is casual and friendly. lunch hour tends to get a little busy, but they have a decent amount of seating for such a small place."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong in going to the original VIG!
I used to come here for 1/2 priced bottles of wine on Sundays... But now they have a twenty-two Tuesday special. You get a bottle of wine and one of their delicious apps for only $22. That's a steal!
You can order their cheesy Tatter tots or get their trifecta hummus. All the apps are made to share and delectable in every bite.
Their patio is perfect for a large party to sit next to the fireplace (we had 8 of us). This place will be my go to place for Tuesday Hh with the girls!"}
{"text":"I have been to Vig for many an afternoon, happy hour, lunch and dinner. I live not far from there and I can promise this: The Vig is very, very popular. 

The Basics:
+ Casual (like 85% of Phoenix). There are TVs inside.
+ HH is M-F 3-6pm. ($2 off cocktails, $1.5 off drafts, $1 off domestic beer & well drinks)
+ 1/2 priced wine on Sundays
+ Elvis Before Noon plays on Sunday (time varies depending season, 6pm in summer, earlier when it's not god awful hot.) Great cover band. If you come once you'll know the rotation. 
+ The Vig Rig will scoop up Arcadia residents. (Free!) 602-722-5976. Fr/Sa 5pm-2am. Su 2pm-10pm.
+ Parking is tight. Bring cash for the valet. Otherwise play Frogger and park across 40th street. Far enough from Mamma Mia that no one gets upset.)
+ And yes. That is a Vig cat you see leisurely making rounds. Don't pet him if you're allergic to cats. Stop complaining about it.
+ Follow them on Facebook to catch specials. (A current summer special is $4 Titos Vodka for the summer.)
+ Additionally look at their website calendar for deals. (Ex: Twenty-Twosdays = 1 app + a bottle of wine.)

SEATING
Misters abound outside. Fireplace in the winter. Lighting almost makes you feel like you're in someone's backyard. Booths line one wall inside that seat four.

People really want to sit outside. ESPECIALLY when Elvis Before Noon plays. If you have any interest in nabbing a seat on Sunday come early. It's ridiculous. Otherwise there is a bar setup in the back. People have been known to dance in the middle of everything. Kind of like watching someone shimmy at a wedding. You don't want to watch, but you can't help stare, in open fascination with your mouth open.

FOOD
Pretty good. And plenty of options for vegetarians and individuals who eat healthy. The sides are excellent to nibble on. (I'm a fan of sweet potatoes.) Can't go wrong with the guac and chips or \"double down\" hummus. Salads are delicious. My favorite is the prickly pear. Sharing is fun with the smoked salmon or deconstructed fish tacos. I've never met a daily flat bread I didn't like. (Note: These can be made vegetarian. The Vig will just remove meat. No additional customizations.) I've shared the banana bread pudding more times than I can count. (Shh!)

MISC
This is a popular first date spot. I've run into other first dates here. I have NO idea why so many men want to take women here. Seating might be tough and you'll be hovering in the aisle trying to get a drink. Alternatively, you'll be seated up front waiting for a booth to open. (The Vig unfortunately doesn't have little beepers to hand out.) 

This place is kid friendly. But only in the way people bring tiny human beings and sprinkle them in with a bar crowd. I have no idea why this happens.

And that's The Vig!"}
{"text":"The Vig was great!  We ordered the following-
Apps:
Chips and Guac-- YUM, good chips
Sweet Potato Fries-- good but not great
Spinach Dip- v. good

Vig-azz burger-- it was big and it was good.  
Pasta Special-- delish

Cheesecake-- excellent

The parking was a bit nightmarish but whatever, I am downtown a lot so I am used to it by now.  It's valet ($3) or you have to park across the street on the west side of the Checks Cashed joint. 

Lots of cocktails-- everyone seemed to enjoy them all.  We were a group of 5 and the booth was perfect.  The setting was chill, just a really good experience.  I am looking forward to my next night out at The Vig!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, but I'll def go back to the Vig.  Delish food, drinks were made perfectly, and the patio was a great location to kick back and do some good people watching."}
{"text":"Ladies, please be careful especially on a Saturday night. I was here last night (Saturday) with a couple girlfriends seated on the patio. We ordered drinks from the server who brought them from the inside bar so we could not see them being poured or who had access to them before delivering to our table. After just one Cosmopolitan I was barely able to walk and got very sick later than night. This has never happened to me before and I'm concerned something was slipped in my drink. Not necessarily by staff but possibly a patron at or near the bar before our drinks came to us. Thank god my girlfriends were there to get me home safely. Just a lesson learned to always keep an eye on your drinks from the moment they are poured... No matter where you're at!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice place to meet up with distant family and have a bite to eat. The food was excellent and it was very good quality. 

The only complaint I had was the service...
The waiter brought out everyone's food, but two people and then proceeded to blame it on someone else (which it could have been, but still just apologize and move on). By the time the last person got their food (15 minutes after everyone else) my food was cold. 


Other than that specific waiter everything was great! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm! I had a deal chicken deal for this place, os the BF and I gave it a try this afternoon for linner (lunch/dinner). The place is cute inside... has that modern feel. I ordered the carne asada on a potato pancake and he got the hot chick sandwich with sweet potato fries. We also split a side salad. The salad was good, it tasted very fresh and the balsamic dressing was creamy and delicious. The carne asada was sooo good! Wow! The meat was very tender, I was able to cut it with a butter knife, and it had a great flavor of the combo of guac, spicy tomato sauce, pico de gallo, and cotija cheese. Then you add in a potato pancake and it is just a flavor explosion in your mouth. It was sweet, savory, spicy, creamy, and crunchy all at the same time. It was pretty awesome. The hot chick sandwich was also very delicious. It was smokey because it has a smokey cheese, but it also tasted really fresh from the veggies and the chicken was juicy. Overall it was a very good meal. I'll be back, especially to try the awesome 5$ burgers on monday and good looking happy hour. 

PS I have been by there at night on weekends to try to get a drink and it is super crowded... it's probably fun, but not my scene."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with the good things: 
Food is great 
FULL bar 
Great prices 
Good service 
AMAZING outdoor seating 

Bad things: 
Flooded with DOMS (Dirty old men) 
Crowded with cougars 
Smokey patio 
PAID parking 

I live in the area and love this bar. It is always my top pick (which Parlor has recently stole) and I generally always enjoy myself. 
The parking sucks. You have to pay and they monitor the surrounding lots like they are the Mafia or something. The prices are great and the food is surprisingly good. The atmosphere is hit or miss depending on the crowd. Being a married 20-something, I am not a big fan of men old enough to be my father in True Religions crowding my space. The good news is, you can always count on the Arcadia cougars to distract the young guys from bothering you. :) Its a great local hang out and worthy of a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I used to really like the Vig, and I still do, to an extent. The problem is that it's devolved into a Scottsdale douche bar, aka sausagefest now. Maybe it's always been this way and I just picked up on it the last time. 

I really dig the patio and they have William Reed spin there on Saturdays. It works for 2.5 stars, rounded down for dudes. 

They should rename it to \"The Twig\" and be done with it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to drink, terrible place to eat. I have tried to give their food multiple chances but, I leave disappointed every time. However, the atmosphere and drink selection are perfect for a fun night out in Arcadia, just don't come hungry."}
{"text":"I've been going to Vig for years now. The food is tasty, the service is good, and the vibe is perfect. A very nice place to relax and meet friends. It's great in the fall and spring on the patio. We also like going on Sunday for 1/2 price bottles of wine."}
{"text":"Love the downtown location. I've only been once before and when I came back to visit, I had to come back....just for the Pasole! The outdoor space is awesome and the house it's situated in is like a cape cod house in downtown. I just live the building. We had drinks...
Me a Moscow Mule, him a beer and hen a Martini. We had guacamole and chips, and wings and then he had a hamburger and fries and I had a large bowl of that goodness...the pasole was on point. Of course it was way too much, so I took it home and had it a day later and it was even better then."}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio! Super cute intimate lighting and misters. Great wine selection also! 

Perfect for a first date kinda night or a casual night out gossiping with the girls drinking wine. :)"}
{"text":"I liked my VigAzz burger. Very flavorful and cooked exactly the way I asked for it. Most of the meals at the table looked excellent. I think their kitchen has it right. I would not hesitate to eat at a place that served burgers this good. 

I didn't care for the server's demeanor - not a lot of grace or courtesy. This place is run more like a night club than a restaurant or bar.  It is a very good alternative to clubbing. They have a gorgeous patio that I would love to spend time at but it was too cold to sit out.  The noise inside was deafening.  I could not hear the people at my table and I'm sure that we contributed to the noise because we had to shout to each other to be heard. The accoustics were horrible.

The tables are cement slabs that didn't look like they could be cleaned very well.  This turns me off because my utensiles are placed on that unclean surface.  I'm not sure how bad that is if you compare it to eating on a picnick bench at the park but I didn't like it. 

If it was not for the great burger I don't think I would return.  It is a nice looking place and it has some things to offer."}
{"text":"Terrible service every time I've gone. I went there once for a friends birthday and the server was awful. We had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. I went back when my friends and family were in town because my brother wanted to go there and it was even worse. There were two bartenders on and even sitting at the bar we had to wait for our drinks. This time we didn't even stay to eat because it was so awful. We will never go again."}
{"text":"Lovely patio, decent wine list, good beers.

Problem?  It's WAY, WAY, WAYYYY too LOUD INSIDE.  HUNH?  WHAT DID YOU SAY?  KETCHUP?  NO THANKS!!!!  OH, WHAT?  HUNH?  

The Vig patio is the perfect spot for Spring and Fall.  Hang out on the patio, chat, drink, enjoy.

Plug your ears upon entering and leaving so as to preserve your hearing. Oh, and make sure you have $3 and a tip for the valet---it's not really optional."}
{"text":"Really liked my salad. Husband said his beef dip was great. My son was very happy with his sliders. They brought fruit from the bar for him which made me and him happy."}
{"text":"Every time I visit AZ, I find myself at The Vig following an evening of hardcore Scottsdaling, and this trip was no different. Although I have missed out on the Sunday Fundayness of The Vig, I can easily understand how it gets hoppin'!  The outdoor patio is spectacular for lounging, glass clinking and chatting, and when you add music, you can see how the place would just light up.

My experiences have been less rock n roll and more just rock-esque, but wonderful nonetheless. This past time we were waiting for a friend to join us and we were starving (read: hung over), so I asked the gentleman filling up my lemonade (refreshing and just enough tart for my taste buds) if he could bring us some bread (which I don't believe is customary), but ask and you shall receive must be The Vig's motto, because that is exactly what happened. It wasn't a half-ass attempt either, it was a country loaf with a butter marmalade spread in the middle. Delightful!

Then came my Hot Chick (which I ordered for obvious reasons) - their version of a sensational toasted sandwich (grilled chicken breast, arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta). I only ate half because of the generous portion of vig rings accompanying the 'wich. They were so well prepared and struck the perfect balance of onion and ring!

Another exceptional dining sesh at The Vig. One of these days I will go for just their cocktails (this eating thing is getting out of control)!"}
{"text":"WOW, I like this place.  Really Posh yet comfortable atmosphere.  The food is wonderful and inventive, the beer selection is a who's who of micro brew and the patio is a great place to spend an afternooon day drinking!  It tends to get a little over crowded on the weekend nights so I usually stick to Sat. & Sun. afternoons.  Again a great place to chill with friends, drink great beer and enjoy the weather.  Happy hour here is always popular and the grilled wings cant beat!"}
{"text":"This place is dope.  A really fun place to have drinks and grab a bite to eat.

I got the hot vings at happy hour, ordered two because that's how I roll ha.  We drank and ate and had fun inside and out.  

Plenty of new faces to keep your people watching at bay and with good company this place has a great vibe.  Enjoyed it before we out that night...Vhumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the patio setting at the Vig. I went for an early dinner, and there weren't too many people there. It's a walk in and seat yourself deal, so there was no wait. I ordered the Mac n Cheese with bacon, and I give it a solid four stars. The portion was huge, the taste was solid, the price was decent, and the ambiance was nice--as expected. I recommend checking this place out. (Not with a baby--you'll get disgusted looks from hipsters and wait staff alike.)"}
{"text":"I can only say that if I lived in the Arcadia area I would be here too much of the time and would have less money!  This is one of the best neighborhood bar/grill that I have  visited.  They have a great happy hour and on Sundays all bottles of wine are half off. Summertime music starts at 6pm on Sundays and the band is good.   Hubby and I sat at the bar, bartenders were nice and helpful..we had just come from lunch so wanted to check this place out since I had seen good reviews about it.  Food looked great, they had a nice wine selection.  I would love to come back for the food and see what everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took my out for a birthday dinner here as a surprise to see the bocce  ball, but it was under construction.  We showed up for happy hour and the place was packed.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but our server was swamped with a large party that had guest arriving the entire time we were there.  We shared the traditional wings, chips and guacamole, and sliders from the happy hour menu all of which were delicious.  Wings were crispy and full of flavor worthy of 5 stars alone. 
Salsa was a bit bland, but the chips were fresh and guacamole was tasty to compensate.  Lastly the sliders get the two thumbs up for being on pretzel rolls.  We each had a drink and still had a bill under $25!  I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the decor but that doesn't take away from the great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!  If I lived in the PHX area, this would be a frequent stop for me.  If you like people watching, very entertaining if you've ever seen Mystery Science Theater, you'll love it.  Of you want SIMPLY AMAZING FOOD WITH COOL FLAVORFUL CONCEPTS, you'll love it!

Must try's...  Any one of their specialty drinks!  Great flavor, and the waitress seemed to know all about each of them.  Mac and Cheese...  Don't laugh at all of those other YELP!!! reviews calling out it's creamy buttery, (insert adjective here), goodness.  They/we know what they/we are recommending!  You should pay attention to us!


Oh, almost forgot...  Great prices too!"}
{"text":"It's just okay..
I think a lot of the review are over-rated.

But with that being said, I definitely think if you are thinking about trying this place, then you absolutely should. It's somewhere I have visited a few times, but soon realized it was not as good as I originally thought. I was reeled in by the outdoor seating and the cool ambiance. 

The food is just okay.

I ordered the mac and cheese and charcuterie board.
The mac and cheese was bland (even with the addition of broccoli). I think kraft blue box is better (not to mention cheaper.) 
The charcuterie board was decent. I would order this again, but definitely not the mac and cheese.

Overall, just try it. 
It is pricey, so beware of over ordering."}
{"text":"Oh Vig-Ass burger how I love thee!! You brought me out of my funk when I stopped in. Had a long, dreary week and came in for a pick me up, was alone. After enjoying half of my deliciousVig Ass burger( yes I took the other portion home! Couldn` leave it or finish it, quite big!) and those scrumptious sweet potatoe fries!! All I can say is,I left with a smile on my face!! Can`t wait for the new uptown location to open, right down the street from me!!"}
{"text":"The Vig has a great happy hour! I've come at non happy hour times, and it is pretty good... however, the prices are somewhat high for the quality. 
Their drinks are also tasty.
The service here is pretty good. I have had a rude server a time or two, but I've also had very sweet servers too.
And their drink specials on Sunday morning are nice!"}
{"text":"It's expensive but you really can't beat the atmosphere and the wine list. Happy hour is also a total deal!! You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu either. Winter months are the best to get the full patio experience."}
{"text":"Not the best service on a Sunday morning. Our party of 8 waited 45 minutes for a table, after we sat down it took another 45 minutes to get our food. They were out of one of their main menu breakfast items. We ordered 6 mimosas and 2 bloody Mary's - their self serv Bloody Mary Bar was out of everything and we got the incorrect number of mimosas. 6 of our 8 meals came out wrong - 2 were sent back and only 1 came back right. After asking the servers several times for silverware, we had to get our own from the bar. It's safe to say we won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened the first day. I have always had a great experience here with great food and great staff. They have good specials during the week and a fun happy hour with a great group of people that frequent the establishment. Nice selection of import beers and  they are always very cold."}
{"text":"I like. Atmosphere, food, employees, peeps, drinks, bathrooms I like. Parking, maybe not so much, but I'm over it. The sheer number of solid veggie options on the menu is enough for my vote of confidence. To also draft up a specialty cocktail menu that actually looks and tastes appealing to me is a rare and beautiful thing. Mmmm basil strawberry lemonade.

Fries, portobello sandwich, korma, hummus platter - all of them hit the spot for a Friday night sampling. Though it was a bit busy (which was to be expected on a Friday night) and the waitstaff was a little stretched, the experience was fabulous. Good vibes over in the bocce court and great vibes from the people. The kitty was quite the chair hog for such a small furball, but that cat owns the place and is damn cute. I wish I lived closer so I could make this my neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Finding a happy hour spot that is kid pet adult seniors anybody friendly with healthy food and friends on a Friday booyah I found my happy Friday spot"}
{"text":"Great place for a Sunday Funday on a cool brisk day in Phoenix. I loved the burger that I got because it was made with pretzel bread as their bun and the sweet potato fries were simply mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the back server Ryan for bussing our area instantly a second we sat down but praise Ricky for always serving us amazingly every time my friends and I come after our shift in our own restaurant."}
{"text":"I was going to do 3 stars, then I remembered what great service we had and threw in the extra star. She never introduced herself so I'm going off the name on the check. \"Glow\" was our server and she was great. Our group of 5 was seated immediately and she pretty much just left us alone to chat it up but was there when we needed her. Fantastic! The food however wasn't that great, like I remembered. PC had the vanilla braised short rib tacos and actally said there was too much meat! Thats a 1st but she liked them. TH had the blackened chicken sandwich and liked it. JM had the mac n cheese. It was creamy and she liked it as well. I personally think it would have been better had she added the chicken or chorizo to it. Mom and I split the prime rib dip on a pretzel bun. It came out well done, soggy and barely any meat. The menu said medium rare. Glow asked how everything was and we asked if we could trade it for the turkey cranberry sandwich  instead. She immediately took it back and had a new sandwich in front of us in less than 5 minutes. It was much better but with the coleslaw on it, it was still a little soggy. The sweet potato fries were great but the dipping sauce had curry in it and that just wasn't my thing. All in all,  the food was pretty forgettable. I've been here before and remember the food being pretty fantastic so I don't know what happened. I'll definitely come back but maybe just for atmosphere and cocktails."}
{"text":"I went I. Took forever to get seated the music was to loud and everyone was running around being loud. There was a guy in a baby costume some band so it's just weird. Finally got seat the decorating is pretty btw. So then it takes forever to get a waitress. I'm trying to read the menu it's too loud. I need to pee but don't want to stress looking for the restroom because it was so chaotic. So I glance at prices not crazy expensive but some what expensive. Another ten minutes pass and no waitress, so me and my boyfriend decide to leave. As we're walking out guess who we find outside? All three waitresses hanging out flirting with the valley.. smh my boyfriend says their food is awesome but now I will never know."}
{"text":"I am giving my seal of approval to The Vig for a few simple, straightforward reasons:

*$3.50 pints during Happy Hour
*Decent selection of beer, including Stella and Pinstripe (mmm)
*So-good-you-want-to-moan artichoke dip (which would be that much better if served with warm pita bread; not chips)
*Cool decor with a spacious, modern outside patio
*Friendly and attentive service
*Beautiful and/or interesting people to watch
*Fave candle and hand lotion in the ladies room
*Attracts an array of patrons, like muscle-y tat guys, Euro intellects,  buxom beauties, network engineers and writers
*Trivial Pursuit cards on each table - woohoo!

A few negatives to note:
*5-spiced edamama was totally meh; will never order this again
*Sweet potato fries were served with regular ketchup - bleh
*Has a somewhat chaotic/disorganized feel, inside and out
*Smoking is permitted on the outside patio
*If you don't valet, you must part across the street
*Could use a couple more beers on tap!

All in all, a very nice place to grab HH after a hard day's work. 

During HH the apps are 1/2 off, which allows you to order a couple to share and sample. Between my friend and I, we each had 2 beers and shared 3 apps, totaling only $30. Not bad when you split the cost. 

Plus, our server was a genuine and friendly gal, as was the stunning hostess who greeted us the moment we walked through the door."}
{"text":"A great place and I almost didn't give it 5 stars because it has a bit of the sports bar atmosphere and the music was very loud. When it's too loud to speak at the same table without yelling, well then the whole room has to yell to be heard. They did turn it down on request and the whole room went down a notch or two. 

The food, cocktails and service were top notch for a small place such as this. It's popular so try to get there before prime time. Valet parking takes care of that issue as the place fills up.

We shared the Mac and Cheese, plain, as an appetizer and it was truly tasty. They offer add-ins like broccoli and bacon if that's your thing. 

I had the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake ($15) and it was truthfully the most satisfying meal I have had in years. The beef was well seasoned, pink in the center and pre-sliced. Delicious. This was accompanied by a potato pancake covered with guacamole, sour cream, cotija cheese crumbles and a very well matched garlic tomato sauce. If you have one entree to introduce yourself to their menu, this is the one.

The manager stopped by to say Hi after the server shared my delight with this dish. She thanked us and explained that when the chef left for the other location, they insisted this dish stay here with the restaurant. And a good thing too.

Go here! Eat! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to get together with friends, have some food and drinks to enjoy an evening.  Would definitely recommend to anyone seeking a great place to relax.  The ambience of the place is brilliantly done."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the vig since it opened, & can count on one hand the number of times I've had good service. That said, I got great service tonight, the sun night before labor day, from Thomas. Despite having to wait a little bit to be greeted, Thomas was spot-on from the start. Indulged my request to taste a couple wines before buying, had great food knowledge & descriptions, & overall was really chill & pleasant, even though I came in 15 min before the kitchen closed. (but over an hour before they completely closed; I refuse to be *that* person). Having had a crazy & late night @ work myself, this was a welcome change from the service I often get here. When you go to the Vig Arcadia, ask for Thomas!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times but most recently tried their food, a noodle dish with sriracha sauce that was delicious. I also like the ambience and the back patio with live music and cornhole. Good place for lounging and for nightlife."}
{"text":"Food only ok but pricey. Atmosphere is what makes the concept. Pkg sux & waitstaff (including bartenders) marginal at best. Too many better options in area. Mgmt should seriously revisit their flagship as maybe added too many restaurants too fast?"}
{"text":"Love their brunch. They have an awesome Bloody Mary bar and I recommend the tofu wrap even for non vegetarians :)"}
{"text":"Just got back from The Vig (on a Wednesday night), and I must admit it was a damn good place.  First off, how can you not love a place with its own bocce ball court outside?  Second off, the menu is full of wonderful food selections, and it's really not that expensive (most items for under $10, including a damn good bacon cheeseburger).  Third off, three words:  sweet potato fries.  They were to die for.

I sat outside on the patio, which was a great atmosphere with lots of people gathered around their tables or sitting on the couches in the \"lounge\" area just having a good time with those they were with.  A mix of couples, girls on a \"girls night out\" and groups of people there after work filled the place.  Slightly more of an upscale crowd that what I'm used to (could be expected since it boarders the Arcadia district), but it did not seem that pretentious.  Most people were still in jeans, a prerequisite for most places that I go.  A good mix of people made this great.  Indoors included a long bar and plenty of booths for seating, complete with 2 large flat-screens for watching the game.

Full bar, good beer selection, a DJ that was spinning decent lounge-like tunes, and very attentive (and cute) staff.  Parking on the lot can be a bit difficult, since it is tiny and I think all valet, but there is plenty of parking across the street in the Bally's lot.  Pay attention to the signs, because on weekdays they might tow you if you are not parked in the right area.  Or you can avoid that all together and take advantage of their shuttle service on the weekends (call them for details)."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great, especially the back patio. The only issue I've ever had here is that it takes forever to get your food! We waited over an hour from the time we sat down to when we started eating."}
{"text":"Wow the service here is amazing. They even offered to put my suitcase in the back for me so I wouldn't have to carry it around. Foods great. Drinks are great. Patio is awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Headed to a concert at Celebrity Theater , did a Yelp search for nearby GOOD restaurants and was not disappointed.  

This place is darling!  Sat outside and had yummy cocktails with some of the biggest sandwiches ever!  Loved the sweet potato fries and the Boo was ecstatic over his onion rings. 


Soooooo nice.  Great service."}
{"text":"All of the comments I've heard about this place have been about the patio.  It did not disappoint! Loved the massive tree in the center of the \"courtyard\", I'm sure it's even better in the evening when the lights are on. There was a pretty good crowd for an early Saturday afternoon. May have had something to do with the beautiful weather.....Or the delicious alcohol being consumed on their glorious patio. ;) 

Nothing to complain or rave about when it comes to the service. She was friendly and we never waited too long for our food or drinks. Gotta like that. Something quirky that was purty cool, they have trivia cards on the tables. This made a fun light drinking brunch into an afternoon of debauchery. Those days are the best, cheers to the vig!

Oh and i guess we ate stuff too. So on to that part....My friend had The Best Turkey sandwich that she said was pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary. And I had the Arcadia Burger that was DELICIOUS and on a pretzel bun? Winning! 

Parking is small but not too shabby oh and side note... its dangerously close to OHSO. :)  I will return to The Vig, but next time I'm going for the bloody Mary bar instead of the Blue Moon!"}
{"text":"Been here for several Sundays now, love the vibe but the live band is playing like they are performing for a huge live audience, volume way to high impossible to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Thursday nite 11:47pm (close at 2:00am) its a busy nite and you tell me the Kitchen is closed...when This place has people all over the place eating food...I could understand if the place was dieing down with no customers...this place is definitely not what it use to be !!!"}
{"text":"I make fun of this place a lot because our friends that live anywhere within 10 miles of it seem unable to go 48 hours without stopping in.  They do have pretty good food, and the patio is great.  The bocci ball court was a masterstroke, even prompting me to have the guy who did theirs install one in my backyard.  All in all its a cool place, but I still don't get what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Tasty food, douchey clientele.

Since when did 40th and Indian School become Arcadia? 

We came here based on the good reviews and the lack of places in Phoenix that serve a decent cocktail and have wifi (telecommuting FTW). Our first clue should have been the valet parking... really?? You only offer valet parking? What is this, Arcadia!? 

Music is loud and from the Music for Melenials Spotify channel. Guys wear backwards baseball caps. Women talk loudly and all look straight out of magazines.

Menu is diverse and has gluten free options. The food we ordered (including happy hour fish tacos) was very good - actually worth the pricy cost. Too bad the other personality traits of this place are too much for us to ever come back again. 

If you want to stay in your 20s this is the place for you. Screams douche bag."}
{"text":"Outside-Bricks walls with no attitude 
Inside: dark wood, earth tone colors, a patio with a tree in the middle (with lights in it), a fireplace where you can gather with some friends, cozy seating and trivia game cards on the tables in case you want to play.

You step into this place and you feel a good vibe. 

I have been here three times and have loved every experience. The food is fantastic, not big portions but is good for my diet ;)
If you want to try something different, I would recommend the nachos that come with fries (hashbrown like) that are super yummy! not good for the diet...
I always order their 'baller maritni' , it holds the perfect touch of orange and pineapple flavors along with a cherry at the bottom.. yum!

Now I'm thirsty."}
{"text":"Meh, It was a fun time but I think that spoke more of the company then the place itself. It was way too packed and too busy. One hour and half to get a table at a bar/tavern place is no Bueno. I loved the band though. The patio is very pretty if you can get into it and find a seat/table. The bathroom situation is not good. There are only two stalls. Two women were brawling and getting into it when I visited. I really thought there was going to be a fight.  Alarming! It brought me back to my college days. lol--Also, I am not sure I like Valet parking. I am not cheap but three bucks ( plus tip of course) for Valet parking is Ridiculous! This is Phoenix where most Valets are non existent or free.  I did think all the staff members were very nice though and most of the non bathroom visiting patrons were very nice.  The food was okay but nothing to die over and pricey for what you get. I gave it three stars for the staff and band. It is really more like a two."}
{"text":"Great food great service!

Thai chili wings, house salad and rib eye with a fresh bed of arugula...all a hit, great job chef!!! 

We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour!! Fish tacos are awesome !!!  Also have great wings.  It gets busy so get there early!! Love this place."}
{"text":"I hate being the first person to review a restaurant when I have a below par experience, but here it goes...  the Vig is a very cool space.  If you are design-minded, you will be very exited to see how this non-descript brick shoebox has been transformed into a hip happening bar and restaurant.  The bar is dimly lit, lively and boasts a huge plasma for watching games.  It is the \"anti-Postini\" if you know what I mean, and it is just the neighborhood hang-out I have been searching for (not that I have anything against Postino, I go there all the time, the vibe here is just distinctly different). So, my review for the BAR ONLY is 4 stars.

OK, now onto the hard part.  The food is bad.  The only redeeming quality is that it is also pretty cheap, so you can almost forgive the mis-step.  The Frenchie (french dip sandwich) could have been from Arbys.  The smoked salmon appetizer tasted like a concoction I could make at home - a slice of lox on a sliver of Safeway-quality french bread topped with a squirt of Thousand Island (not that I would ever subject myself to that at home). Very disappointing.  The grilled veggie plate was pretty good, but it was served with a bad vinaigrette that tasted suspiciously like bottled Italian salad dressing.  Food rating? 2 stars.  

In sum, this place is a mixed bag.  It is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood and I will certainly be back for drinks, but I would go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Sean makes dat ting go skraaa. Gratatatata puruum pa pa pa and the boom boom brah. The water is free."}
{"text":"Review will be regarding lunch which from reading other reviews has a different vibe.  Most people are business types and the service is based on that.  The times I have gone it has never been too overwhelming with the service, but when we needed assistance it was available.  I usually try to sit inside as the trees outside have leaves that can fall on your table/food.  Leaves won't hurt you, but depending on the breeze it can make it not as enjoyable.  Other than that, food was really good and it is a place I visit when the budget allows as lunch will usually run 10-15 bucks."}
{"text":"The best find our spa getaway by far was this cute little gastropub.  Not only that, but as we didn't opt for the rental car, the bar actually has a van service that will pick you up from the hotel and return you, happier, fuller, and slightly more enebriated.

The back veranda takes up an entire block and has great music, lighted wonderland, and bochee ball (sp?).  The interior is posh, modern, but a bit on the crowded side.  Its worth the wait for the outdoor seating.

The food was insanely good.  Flatbread tandori chicken pizza.  Lamb and almond brittle salad.  Achiote salmon with chorizo filled arepa. Topped off with some sweet potato fries.

The wine list was a great compilation.  Somewhat smaller selection, but we never hit a bad one and sampled quite a few.  I love a bar that filters in a good way!

Not sure how often I will be in Pheonix, but I will definitely be hitting the Vig again when I return.

Oh, and kudos to the owner of the Vig Rig and marketing to those trying to escape the slow spa experience for the night :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, but everyone is right, slow service. I had the southwestern salad; the chicken breast didn't have one dry spot in it. Everyone at our table was happy with their food and drinks, and per suggestion of another yelper, the sweet potato fries ARE good, especially with the curry sauce."}
