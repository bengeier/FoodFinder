{"text":"--update-- I got my $100 back after a long attempts. he tried to cut the tax out of it. also tried to give me only $50 because he said they do not have money or get a shisa with the other 50. but after he found that there is no way to cut it he bring $100. the problem he contacted me after mid-night asking me why did I write this review about the place. JUST TO LET YOU ADAM, you do not have right to call me and that is the fact let the people know it.   this place is rep off place it charge too much for a regular thing a sandwich in that restaurant  cost the price of 2 sandwiches and a drink from the same place, so funny. I order a shisha, a sandwich and a drink which cost me $100.  and when I pay it shows that he charge me more than that it was $200 and when I called he said it was a mistake and he will fix it. just be carefull"}
{"text":"This owner is a crook - I am filing a police complaint.  Do not go there.   Left my credit card there by mistake - next day I was charged $100 here.  They manually overrode my credit card so, there would be no need to type in my pin.  Filed a complaint with the fraud dept of my credit card company and the police."}
{"text":"$49 for 1 shisha??? __________________  A friend and I went into Wrap and Roll for a medium shisha (mint) and I ordered a pop. The guy was quiet but nice. He sat in the back watching tv the whole time though, and never asked us how we were doing.   Our medium shisha and one pop came up to $49 !!!!!! We complained, but the guy did nothing.  PLUS we saw a mouse running around inside where we were sitting.   Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because this guy did try to rip me off two times. Both reviews ahead of me helped me because that's why I double checked my charges. Make sure to get a receipt!!! 2x he tried to rip me off. Only reason it's not only 1 star is because I liked the hookah."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is a crook. Avoid going to this place. He has over charged me and many others many times. This has happened especially late nights. He tries to take advantage of people if they are drunk or tipsy. His pricing is not legit and his food is bland. I will NEVER EVER set foot in that place. I've even gone to the better business bureau and reported him. At this point now he keeps trying to send me messages on different sites asking me to remove my post. Not going to happen. His name is Mahmood. I think he has some psychological illness. ONE MORE THING if anyone else has had an issue with this place be sure to post on Yelp or any other site. Just make sure to block him so you won't have to deal with him trying to contact you. Its really annoying.....  Also FYI notice the review from Mahmoud J? This review is from the owner. Funny how now one else has put up 5 stars....plus the review wasn't written by him himself as he doesn't speak english well at all....wtf...LMAO"}
{"text":"*********NOTES:  PLEASE READ THE FILTERED REVEIWS. ITS ALL CORRECT.   Also, notice how all the five star reveiws for this place are from people who have no pictures and have only reviewed one place..fishy yes? ******    I hate writing bad reviews, but I have to.  I came here to pick up some Shawarma's in an emergency for my family.  I asked before I ordered if I could get a deal on 4 shawarmas', and the guy's response : \"Sure, I give you good price!\"  Okay, so I went ahead and I ordered : 2 Chicken and 2 Beef Shawarma's.  The process was fine. He mad overstuffed the shawarmas to the point where I swear they each weighed over a pound. Fine.  The beef was terrible. It was old and dried out and disgusting.  The chicken was delicious though.  But my main qualm : The price.  It clearly stated on the boards (they have those coca cola menu set up with combo prices) that two shawarma's + a can of coke is 9.99.  He charged me 9.99 EACH per Shawarma.  My bill came upto to over 40 dollars.  40 freaking dollars for Shawarma? NO WAY.  It was ridiculous. I asked him, ..\"but the board says 9.99 for two?\"  He said \"Lunch only\"  No where on the sign did it say that the price was applicable for lunch only.  In fact, it was the only area that the price for a shawarma was posted.  Also, a plate was listed as 7.99. How the hell is a shawarma 2 dollars more than a plate?  Oh god, I felt completely ripped off.  And my mom yelled at me for spending so much!"}
{"text":"short review: not good - don't go there  long review: i went here with a few friends a while ago for a shawarma, and we had the combo - two shawarmas (beef and chicken) for 10 bucks with a drink. that was what was advertised, but somehow all of our meals ended up costing around 15 dollars. i wouldn't be super-pissed except that the meal itself was not redeeming at all. the chicken was flavourless, and the beef was packed with an odd artificial flavour. the only real flavour that i tasted was spiciness. not balanced at all, and not enjoyable to eat.  the atmosphere in the place is non-existent, its overly stuffy inside and the outside \"patio\" has sticky chairs that are on an odd slant. just not a good place to go at all."}
{"text":"One word for this shawarma joint: Fal-AWFUL.  I walked in with a friend from Ottawa, and she was excited to try sheesha. We went up to the counter and the guy working said we could get two flavours. Looking over reviews now, luckily he TRIED to bill us before we sat down. The total was $48.70... THA F?! I asked him for a price list, but obviously there was none to be found. He said it was around $20 per flavour, and we were getting two. I argued with his whack self for a bit and then left.  What an f'ing joke of an establishment. Needs to be shut down ASAP."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Yes it is true, the owner has tried to rip me off twice! First time I gave him the benefit of the doubt but it is becoming increasingly obvious. And I saw 2 rats!!! Disgusting!!! AVOID if you value cleanliness and if you dont want to be ripped off!"}
{"text":"Worst falafel I've ever had. The ingredients were not fresh, even the falafel balls were already made before I got there... Totally over done and gross. Dude slapped it together like he didn't give a crap and then over charged me by guessing what the tax was. I regret not looking up reviews before setting foot in there. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"So this why you should check yelp every time you try something new, cashier over charged us (tax on 4.50 is not 2.50) then had the nerves to ask us if we want shesha! ...  STAY AWAY!!!"}
