{"text":"Awesome home cooked style food! What a little gem we found! The outside is a little off putting but once you go in its a completely different situation.

Service was great ! Friendly professional classy staff and great priced filling traditional food!  

Cabbage rolls - saucy simple and tasty 

Perigees- loved the potato ones!! 

Schnitzel- tender, not oily, tasty  

Very fresh ingredients ... Really satisfied our home cooked craving"}
{"text":"We had the Schnitzel and Goulash for dinner one night and both were very tasty. As mentioned by others I was surprised there weren't more people in the restaurant considering how tasty the food was."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here after reading some reviews.  Both the Hunter Schnitzel and Meat Perogies were fabulous.  Perfect sized portions that had a real authentic taste and presentation.  Good service.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers!! I read all of your reviews and you were right, this place is amazing. I loved the food. After reading all of the reviews I had the potato pancake with beef goulash  and it was one of the best dishes I have ever had. If you love latkes this is above and beyond the regular potato pancake. I have never had the Polish version of this and topped with goulash it was heaven. The salads were delicious as well. My dining partner had the schnitzel and raved about it and the said the mashed potatoes were heaven.  The prices are amazing for such good quality great tasting food. The house wine is very good and very reasonably priced. This is the place to bring the family on a budget. The decor is lovely and the server was a sweetheart. It is these types of restaurants that make Toronto a great foodie city."}
{"text":"Tasty, hearty, authentic Polish food. The cabbage soup was complex in a pleasantly surprising way and really flavourful. The decor is casual and modern, but cozy at the same time. Reasonable prices, and pleasant staff. A fabulous addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great authentic Polish food, homemade and delicious.  Lovely new décor, very clean and an art gallery downstairs too!  Prices very reasonable.  Menu items and daily specials.  Will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Polka is home away from home for Polish people and I'm not even from Poland! Food is fresh always. On Sunday, we invited our Polish neighbours for dinner and they took us to Polka. The place was having a private party screen off. Noticed the white tablecloth and flowers on the table. There were only a few tables free but the guy serving the food wanted to move a father and son to a small table just to accommodate us. We decided instead on takeout. I had the stufffed rolled pork and ribs. My husband had a big piece of salmon. The couple had stuffed rolled pork and ribs and schnitzel. All came with three kinds of side dishes. I had a take out tripe soup! It was amazing. All the dishes tasted very good. Service is great and accommodating with our choices."}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice. The perogies are fantastic!  The service was great. They were very helpful  with my mothers wheel chair.  I hope they  are here for a long time!!"}
{"text":"Great Polish food. We had the pierogies, sausage, and the potato pancake with goulash. All dishes were excellent and tasty. The massive potato pancake was definitely the highlight filled with plenty of goulash beef. The sides of beets, cucumbers, and horseradish coleslaw were also great.

Overall, one of the best Polish restaurants I have been to in the GTA."}
{"text":"My family of 12 celebrated dinner here this past month. We tried a variety of dishes on the menu and found everything to be delicious. My Polish 90-year-old father who complains about most restaurants said this is the best meal he has had in years. That was a nice surprise. I've been back now with other people and we all love it. Nice ambience, quality food and at a great price. It's making me hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem in Etobicoke, we went at Friday night and the place was empty. We hesitated to come in but in the spirit to try something different we risked ourselves. What a great food and service! We tried the platter for 2 with perogies and cabbage roll. Comes with mas potato salad and rose wine which conoekted the excellent platter. I will not hesitate to go again."}
{"text":"Large portions good value. It tasted like good home cook meal from a Polish family's kitchen. No frills just simple and good. It's on the west outskirt, while we arrive late the waitress was attentive but no other patrons. Quiet, but fulfilling. Recommend both the golash potato pancake and cabbage roll."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot on the Queensway.  Cute space, good menu, great quality, nice owners. Only been open a few months but I'm still mad it took me this long to find it. A really nice and welcome addition to the neighborhood and light years ahead of Izba,  which is almost across the street. Mains run about $9-$15. The pictures on their website do it justice. Great for the price, excellent presentation.

Can't wait to work my way through the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous family dinner here. 
Polish food at it's best
The food is all freshly home made. 
Everyone had something different. 
The platter for 2 choices are amazing. 
The perogi,  cabbage roll,  schnitzel was fresh and delicious . 
Small family run business. 
You should visit. 
Paola was our server and she was terrific."}
{"text":"We've always loved Polish food. Cafe Pollonez is a little too much of a commute though when the craving hits. So imagine our surprise (and absolute delight) when we discovered this little restaurant less than 10 minutes away! 

Food: glorious. From the pierogis to the schnitzels to the cabbage rolls to the sausages - everything we've tried so far have been excellent. We want to go everyday so we can order each item on the menu!

Service: warm and friendly. There's just always this one lady who does service when we're there (yes I am ashamed her name escapes me) but whether it's lunch or 6pm, she's sweet and patient and very nice. There is a little wait if they're full but nothing out of the ordinary. Their food is worth waiting for!

Ambience: surprisingly, lovely. Because of where it's located, you'd expect this place to be a dive. But it is everything but. Today there are fresh tulips on the tables and there was even a small wedding party celebrating there!

Price: today we paid almost $60 for two (including tip and a couple of beers). Not bad but also not cheap. I knocked a star off because of this (and parking is street - pet peeve!)

If you love Polish food or have never tried it and want to fall in love, just go already!"}
{"text":"Polish night at this family restaurant in Etobicoke. It's a small place but it was pretty full with customers. I started off with the red borscht - red beets soup with dumplings. I'm never a big fan of beets but in a soup, it taste pretty good. Just don't wear a white shirt when you are drinking it.

There were so many dishes we want to try so we ordered a few to share like family style! From cabbage rolls, schnitzel, pierogies and polish sausage. Even though there was 4 of us, we were working so hard to eat it all. We manage to eat the main stuff and left the sides untouched. But everything was delicious, very authentic."}
{"text":"Excellent food, deals, and portions! Service was awesome as well, very friendly staff. Overall great experience! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Everything what I expected and more. Polish cuisine at its best: simple, home made, and delicious. 

Good presentation, swift service and a nice interior - a perfect place to try pieroges, bigos or schabowy. I'm a bit biased - I'm Polish - but this place is as close to a real thing as one gets. 

I will be back, soon."}
{"text":"My first experience of a Polish restaurant. I had the flaki, pierogies, and the breaded chicken with mushrooms. Wow the food was amazing...my personal favourite is the flaki. It's certainly not for everyone but I dig it."}
{"text":"Delish Polish food! Very tasty. 2 of us had the Potato Pancake with Beef Goulash.  The other 2 in our group had Schnitzel dinners. A few beer and 1/2 litre of house wine and dinner for 4, $120 with tip. Great local spot.  We will definitely come back. Tastes like Mama's home cooking."}
{"text":"This is definitely a gem! Delicious home made Polish cuisine. We were looking for a new place to dine in our area which would be similar to Cafe Polonez. That was exactly it. The prices are great too for what you get. Excellent service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great home cooked meals. Great selection. Excellent ambience.
Lovely server.
5 star
A must try"}
{"text":"It's so nice to see so many great reviews for a well-deserving establishment. Here's my five stars to help fortify the rating:

My parents were in town a few weeks ago and I was eager for them to try Kovalsky. We've had (and loved) other Polish cuisine in the city but since moving to the west end, Kovalsky was the natural choice for us, not to mention the high regard for it here on Yelp.

Since my parents can't get around very well any longer, we opted for takeout. I called and spoke to a gentleman, presumably Kris, who suggested that my order might take at least an hour to prepare, for what I assumed was because of how busy they must be. We agreed that I would call back in an hour's time to see where the order stood. Calling back, he said the order would be ready in about another 15 minutes. So I began my trip over.

Upon arriving, I had absolutely nowhere to park. It was a busy Sunday, as I recall, and traffic was horrendous. I ended up about 3 blocks away on a residential street. It's a good thing I left early! When I entered the establishment it turned out Kovalsky was host to a private, what seemed to be, wedding party! (Lot's of kids, music and even dancing)! No wonder they said my order might be a while longer than usual! Completely understandable circumstances for a long order time.

My packages came out quickly after I arrived and I headed home. We loved each and every part of the meal. The potato pancake was like a cloud, bursting with a rain of goulash heaven. The pancake actually had a bold potato flavour and the goulash was not at all too salty. The bigos, perogies and Polish sausage were all also top-notch. My parents are very discerning, particularly with food. They're very old-fashioned and would never enjoy any food gimmicks. There are no gimmicks with Kovalsky. Pure, unadulterated Polish goodness.

Thanks team Kovalsky, you'll hear from us again. Never change."}
{"text":"The food was nice and hearty. I really liked the perogies, the fillings tasted home-made and fresher than the freezer variety. The service was a bit slow, but otherwise a great experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are both Polish-Canadian and have a vast experience in both Polish home-cooked and restaurant fare. Kovalsky has a bit nicer ambiance than most other Eastern-European eateries and the food quality is first rate. HIGHLY recommended.We sampled the potato pancakes, bigos, kielbasa, and assorted salads = all were delicious. Despite the fact that we live in the west end of Mississauga and pass a dozen Polish restaurants on our way to Kovalsky's, we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Family run, the food here is spot on. The decor inside is much nicer than you'd think from looking at the outside. Wait staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"4.5. The food here is very good and the service is good as well.  I had the Goulmbki ant they were excellent. The sauce/gravy is just like my grandma made. 

The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 is the menu is slightly more limited than other Polish restaurants and the items aren't described on the menu.  If you go with people that don't know Polish food, you will need to explain everything on the menu to them."}
{"text":"Authentic polish restaurant, non pretentious and good food at a good price. Really enjoyed the pierogies and cabbage rolls, reminded me of when I was in Krakow. Visited several times and food has been consistently good, no need to go all the way to Roncy anymore!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best tastes like homemade polish food I have had anywhere in the city. Cute little restaurant and friendly service. Highly recommend. We eat here at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Wonderful little neighbourhood spot, and another great place I discovered through Yelp!

Nice dining room, a bit fancy even, with an up-to-date renovation. Very clean. Was surprisingly not busy - though I guess we are talking about the Queensway on a Monday evening here...  service was friendly and capable.  Food was very good.  Schnitzel, cabbage rolls, pierogis, cucumber salad, pickled beets, everything was great.  Prices were very reasonable.  We ordered a meal combination with the house wine, which was possibly not a wine I would drink on its own but was inexpensive and paired well with the food.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was very quiet here on a Wednesday.  Food was tasty and freshly made.

Service friendly and helpful.  Had a platter for 2 and had more than enough that we took some home.  Schnitzel not gargantuan sized like you get some places but tasty, crispy and good portion of meat.  Cabbage rolls were big and sauce nice flavour.  Perogies also tasty (not fried which I usually prefer) but good amount.  

Came with a drinkable house wine.  Overall I'd certainly go back."}
{"text":"Service/environment left me feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome. We came on a Monday evening, and during our 1.5hr stay, we were the only customers. The one waitress working didn't greet us, smile, say thank you, awkwardly approached us and left me feeling as if we weren't supposed to be there. During the time we were eating, she sat behind the bar and seemed miserable to be there. 

The restaurant was cold and turned off the lights to the basement where the washrooms were, it seemed as if they were trying to save on the energy costs regardless of the modern decor. 

Food was pleasant but I would not return here due to the ambiance."}
{"text":"Being Polish myself I already know polish food well, but this place brings you dishs that only Babcia (Grandma) knows how to make. Great friendly staff, service was exceptional would highly recommend for anyone with a small party to check this place out. I gave it 5 stars because it was an experience I wont forget. Good to see a little bit of Poland in the GTA"}
{"text":"This is my first review ever.  Booked my mom's birthday there.  Very happy with the service, food, ambiance.  Reason for only 4 stars is the cabbage rolls were good but would not order them again.  The bigos and salads are outstanding....so is the schnitzel.  Have heard the borscht is also good.  Will definitely be going there regularly.  All 17 guests were very happy with the food.  Prices are reasonable as well.  Park on the street.....just wish they were open on weekdays for lunch, oh well..."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is a top notch item. Nothing is filler to make the menu bigger, so you get the highest quality every time. Probably the nicest Polish restaurant around that isn't a hall."}
{"text":"Dare I say that Kovalsky is the Café Polonez of the West-end?  Located 4 blocks east of Royal York, Kovalsky is much smaller restaurant that Polonez.

Since they're both Polish restaurants, menus have similar items, but Kovalsky's also has desserts.  I *don't* remember Polonez having desserts.  I could be wrong though 'cause I haven't been there for at least 2-3mths.  Kovalsky's also offers different platter options WITH wine, as per the pic that I took.

We ordered:  Kopytca (Polish gnocchi/lazy vareniki) w/ Beef Goulash & Salads ($13.99), Breaded Chicken Breast w/ Mashed Potatos & Salads ($12.99), & Potato/Cheese Pierogies ($7.99/8).  Everything was really delicious and freshly made!

(We initially ordered Veg Cabbage Rolls, but they didn't have any.)

The difference between the 2 restaurants was that Kovalsky's was marginally cheaper than Polonez, and food wasn't laden in salt.  I found Polonez quite salty the last time I ate there.  Salads also tasted freshly made.

Service was pleasant and friendly.  Very chill and quiet for a Friday evening dinner."}
{"text":"I was craving pierogies one day and decided to search up a place on Yelp. I was directed to Kolvasky's as most of the reviews were good AND they have authentic Polish food! I haven't really had much pierogies or real Polish food in my life before as I've only had the ones from Costco...but I heard that they are not authentic.

I Went with a friend on a Tuesday evening at around 7:30pm and we were the only ones there. The restaurant was clean and vibrant. It was very polish-like. The waitress greeted us and was very friendly and accommodating. 

I ordered the Kolvasky's Schnitzel ($13.99) that was served with 3 small scoops of mashed potato and a side salad, with a fried egg on top of the schnitzel. It is quite interesting because I've had other similar schnitzels from other countries before but never had it with an egg on top. The portion was huge! The schnitzel was huge too, and the flavour was okay, but it wasn't anything special.  

I also ordered a plate of pierogies ($7.99) for us to share and the waitress let me have half meat and half potatoes. The pierogies were stuffed! I liked it so much more than the schnitzel. I would definitely order this again if I come back. 

My friend ordered the polish sausage, which was served with bigos (traditional cabbage and meat stew) and 3 small scoops of mashed potato. I tried a little bit of the sausage and it was really salty for me. So I would suggest eating the sausage with the cabbage. My friend liked the dish thought it was delicious. 

Overall, the food was tasty. But they put A LOT OF MSG in their dishes because I was VERY thirsty for many hours afterwards."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow amazing. I travel the world and this is the best meal I have had in years. Please support these guys"}
{"text":"Wow! I come to this place once a week, and am completely addicted! The potato pancake with beef goulash is so delicious, it's definitely my favourite item on the menu. The perogies are good too, but I find the dill flavour to be a bit too strong for me. 

Service is always great, though some evenings during the week, there are very few customers, and sometimes they close early, which I find a bit frustrating. If I'm planning on coming later in the evening, I'll call beforehand, just to make sure they're open."}
{"text":"I must say am very picky when it comes to my homeland food as many are either too salty or too fatty. But wow this place is a gem, the food is made literally fresh from scratch so don't mind the little wait as it's totally worth it. Me and my husband got 4 glasses of wine and a 2 main entrees and walked out with tip at $56.00 that's rare these days. We loved the service and how clean and cosy the restaurant felt. If you love comfort food u will definitely not regret stopping in. Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices, super sweet waitress.

The view might not be terribly inspiring, and the sun is blinding at around dinner time in the window seat, but this isn't the place you come to for ambiance. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad here, still edible. very average.. We got the bill and they charged us liquor tax of 15%.... Didn't understand that part."}
