{"text":"I had actually passed by this place several times without any consideration before going with a group of my gal pals.  A rather large group (there were about 20 of us).  When I walked in the door I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is really contemporary and modern looking.  As a result I thought the prices would be a little on the high side but man I was I wrong.    As you enter you are given a card which keeps track of all that you order.  Instead of having to wait for a server to take your order you simply head over to your station of choice (pizza, pasta or salad) and place your order.  Be amazed as your food is prepared right before your very eyes.  You can order drinks from the bar or the food stations.  Once your food is ready you can take it back to your table and dive in.    I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste of my food but it's definitely some place that I would revisit.  The meal prices ranged from $7-$11 and for the portion size that I received it can't be beat.  This is also a great place for large groups.  Thanks to the order cards you never have to worry about splitting the bill.  Another great thing is that the evening I went there was live music.  A couple of my friends were even asked to join the musician in song and dance.  That made for a pretty entertaining few minutes.  Thankfully they didn't torture the other patrons for too long.  So, if you're looking for a place to eat with a bunch of your friends and you're just looking to relax in an aesthetically cool, chill environment with cheap eats this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Loved this! The pasta station took a lot longer than was ideal. Decor was great. Enjoyed self seating and the use of a card to choose items. Food was quite tasty."}
{"text":"The food is yummy, but the self serve style and the personality of the employees leave a lot to be desired. There is only 1 salad station and it gets congested at lunch."}
{"text":"The first time I attended Vapiano was for a social event on a  Friday night. There was live music which was awesome and the aroma of fresh Italian food filled the room. I had drinks, which were great but did not intend to eat that night. With that being said, I knew I had to return for a meal. I wasn't thoroughly impressed  with the food, it's ok. I had the Thai Italy which was no bueno, which i had gotten a pizza. The decor might fool you into thinking you are getting more quality than you actually are. I quite like the set up and the quick and easy strategy they are going for.   Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food this was a new experience for us. We had breakfast crapes . The food  was fresh . We sat outside it had a great environment. The other customers were warm and friendly everybody just was having an enjoyable Mother's Day meal."}
{"text":"Go to happy hour here, $5 pizzas, enough said.  Right when you walk in you get a card, that card is used to purchase any food you want, it is pretty sweet.  This location is legit because when you walk in, you feel like you are going into the lounge area of a club, beautiful wood seating, high chairs, elegant chairs, high ceilings and some shrubbery.  Best part about the ambiance is the high ceilings, makes you feel like you have a lot of open air and space to think your best ideas.    As for the food, definitely think the hh $5 pizza is fantastic.  It is thin crust and flat pizza, so not overloaded on the toppings, and is great for one person.  Got the meat pizza on this occasion, and eating in this atmosphere was great.  Bottom-line, go in with a nice blazer and get the pizza."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Will come again. Some reviews stated it was cafeteria style which made us initially hesitate. Walked in and we immediately loved the trendy and upbeat vibe. Great atmosphere and good for kids regardless of time of day. Especially fun was talking to the cook as he prepared our food--- which is excellent and portioned appropriately."}
{"text":"It's a good concept, but poorly executed. I have been to Vapiano about 4 times and each time it gets worse. If you have haven't been before, when you walk in, it looks appealing and smells good. They hand you a blank credit card and you walk up to the food stations to order. Pizza station first, then the pasta stations. Then you take a seat and wait to pick up your food. When I went with my friend, she had never been before, she was utterly confused by the place, several people cut in front of her at the food stations, and she had to wait forever for her meal. When she got it, she said it was mediocre at best and she was never coming back with me. I have been during the work week lunch time crowd (go at 11:30am or the lines become unmanageable) and for the 5pm dinner. They do have a small outdoor seating area but don't bother as all you are doing is watching office workers go home!  As for my meal, I got the pizza- it was an undercooked bland mess. Then I got the pasta, there is a difference between al dente and hard. This restaurant needs to spend the extra 3 minutes and make sure the food is cooked thoroughly.   To Vapiano: either do table service or set it up cafeteria style, this in-between business is not working."}
{"text":"Vapino was very good! I go there a least once every few weeks or so,but this time I brought some of my family which were generally quite confused and I had almost no way of explaining how it worked. I wish that they would make it easier for first timers but alas they enjoyed a lot and agreed to come back soon. No ones meals were cold which has happened to me many of times at Ink and Ivy's, a restaurant near Vapino's. Plus, I would give 5 stars if the employees were a little more patient with there new customers, I have gone many times with friends that have never gone before and they were very nice and patient. This they weren't I have no idea why, they were also different people. So, in the end Vapino's is delicious and very much so recommend this amazing restaurant! It is a very well done CHAIN. WHAT?!? You would never ever know that if you didn't go to their restaurant, which means they care about their food,reputation,and basically every thing else. They are in 3 different countries so they have a bit of everything to eat. Vapino is delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and the set up is cool. The whole idea of using their card for the different stations was really great I've never seen anything else like it. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this is a pizza chain. That being said the food was excellent. The pizza was fresh, thin crust Italian style. The insalata mista was delish and fresh. In fact they grow their own herbs right in the middle of the restaurant. A great place for lunch Uptown."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, the food was delicious and the cost is budget friendly!! Will be going back again!!"}
{"text":"Great place for my uptown lunch break! Always quick and always delicious! I get the penne with Arrabiata sauce and throw in some mushrooms and shrimp. I have yet to find a better arrabiata sauce! The concept scared me at first but it is easy!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for dinner when I want to go out uptown. Very reasonably priced, and I always leave with leftovers! The pasta is all made in house, and you can taste the difference. I LOVE the carbonara. The atmosphere/decor is perfect for a casual dinner uptown, and I've been there on nights when they have live music. Very cool place!"}
{"text":"College cafeteria quality pasta and salads with self service and a surprisingly high price point. Pass"}
{"text":"This place caught me off guard a little. I was impressed by the interior design. The way how they had everything set up was quite a unique experience. I would definitely recommend for anyone if they want a different atmosphere. In terms for food, it is what you expect from most Italian restaurants-with their own twists."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Very original, trendy, fresh, and fun!  They even have gummy bears at the front!  We will certainly be back, there was a learning curve related to how to order and the little card they give you, but it's simple enough and actually quite brilliant.  Friendly staff, great food and good price.  Will return!!!"}
{"text":"As we walked into Vapiano, the hostess greeted us by saying we were preparing to dine \"at the Mercedes of cafeterias.\"  Um... what?  On that note, we were told to seat ourselves, and that's about where the attention and service ended (even though we told the hostess this was our first time).  The basic concept is one of cafeteria-type stations: salad, pizza, pasta.  Each diner receives a tracking card to swipe at the chosen station once the order has been placed.  The menu is fairly large, so it's easy to find something to make everyone happy, but the extras and specialties are a bit hidden.  For example, I didn't realize I could add veggies to my marinara & mozzarella pasta until I overheard someone ordering next to me; additionally, only some people at my table were offered complimentary bread when they ordered.  Drinks were self-serve from the fountain machine in the back, but we had to ask one of the servers (who were few and far between) for glasses.  On the whole, the food was pretty good, but the level of service (or lack thereof) and total concept just didn't do anything for me."}
{"text":"Won't go back.   Tasteless food, and indifferent, MIA service.   Too many other great choices in the area."}
{"text":"Kinda like a fancy food court. The food is a hit or miss. The exact same dish when ordered on two different days may or may not be the same. The desserts are good though. Good for lunch or days when I don't want something too fancy but generally not my first pick"}
{"text":"Me and a local friend, recently visited Vapiano.  I was please with the atmosphere upon arriving.  There was plenty of seating available in an open indoor style courtyard and the food stations were available with view, to watch your meal be prepared before your eyes!  It's a neat concept, where you receive a card upon entry to swipe your orders. The card alleviates the hassle of a waiter or waitress.  We decided to go for the Pasta station.  I was already geared on having the Scampi E Spinaci with Linguine pasta. I must say it was fairly good.  I felt that the Pancetta could have been left out of my dish.  My friend had the Chicken Alfredo which was pretty bland.  Extra Parmesan please! made it suitable.  We did not order pizza because the pasta and homemade bread was very filling.  Overall, Vapiano is great to go out with friends or have a nice date night. The interiors are modern and chic.  I especially liked the olive trees planted at some of the tables. Warning!! if you are a dessert eater please pass up the pre-made desserts, they did not look appetizing. I will definitely return to try the pizza."}
{"text":"My friend waited in the pasta line for 45 minutes before she even ordered. My other friend and I ordered our pizzas and finished them before our friend waiting for the pasta had ordered. After approaching the manager about her frustration, he was rude and disrespectful. This place is completely inefficient and has no structure."}
{"text":"When I come to vapiano...im always pleased. Im not a big pasta fan but its something about the way Robert cooks my pasta that keeps me coming back for more. His cooking skills are great and his humor is the cherry in top. Vapiano has a great ambiance and me and my friends love to visit for drinks and music. I can definitely say as long as I can get Roberts great pastas, ill most definitely return for more than just drinks and music and bring more of my friends to experience the greatness."}
{"text":"I was kind of stalking this place before it opened...I saw the \"coming soon\" sign for so long that I thought it changed it's mind about coming to CLT....then low and behold it opened. My thoughts:  Customer Service: I had great service from when I approached the hostess stand to leaving the establishment. Very important in my book! Even the cooks (as you watched them prepare your food) were smiling and friendly.   Food: You do have to pick up a tray and grab food (think cafeteria) but nothing about the food will take you back to your high school days. It's prepared on the spot and the pizza (surprise, surprise) I had was okay. Not the best I have had but not the worse either.   Atmosphere: Great for lunch. It's huge and if the set up was any different it would look almost too big and uninviting. I would love to see what this place looks like at night. It is family friendly during the day--and would be a great place for a birthday celebration--esp. if you can grab one of the huge tables with a tree planted in the middle. I think this would be a nice date spot.   My rating is an overall good one because of the customer service (fab) and atmosphere (not the same ole same ol) but I would like to go back and check out different food options."}
{"text":"Interesting and unique concept that makes you feel more like you're in Europe than the US. You have to go to the bar and chefs directly to get your food. Not my favorite but also nice if you just want to sit and talk for awhile without feeling obligated to keep spending money.  Our group of three had the shrimp scampi, the roasted garlic pizza and then ricotta and spinach ravioli. All of them were decent but definitely not spectacular. Id probably eat here again if i worked or lived in Uptown but for the few times each month that I'm there, there are other locations I prefer."}
{"text":"The food here is always good as you watch them cook your food to order.  Better selections as of lately as it seems they've changed their menu a bit since my last visit this past summer.    They reserve seating apparently.  I saw several tables reserved the entire time we were there (1:20) and they were never used.   It posed a challenge for my party of 3 to be able to find a seat.  They need to do that better.  The big issue on this Friday even was the noise level.  It caused my family and I to have to raise our voices quite a bit to talk to each other at the table we did find.  Not a pleasurable experience in the least."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here after a Panther's night game. They were within an hour of closing yet still invited us in and were very helpful with our order.  We had the Thai spaghetti. Great pasta! I can't wait to go back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"This place looks very inviting, open, and trendy, but if you call a complete lack of process and service the \"latest-greatest\" thing, then this place is for you.  Too bad they put so much thought on the looks and not the functionality.  They give you some crazy card with a magnetic strip on it to track your food and drink purchases, but dont tell you that there is no table service.  After a stressful day of work, the last thing that I want is to have to get up every time I want some water, beer, or food and go wait in some idiotic line that is only being serviced by one bar tender during happy hour.  And good luck trying to get drinks for other people at your table and then trying to remember who's card is whos.  If and when you finally get a drink, then you have to go wait in line again to pay!!  Give me a break with that crap.  Good luck in finding people in Charlotte that want to \"dine\" like Europeans on a regular basis.  At least who ever takes over that spot in a few months when this place tanks won't have too much redecorating to do."}
{"text":"Oh by the way I found a refreshing drink by Honestade and my favorite is \"POMERGRANATE BLUE\"  Such a refreshing drink"}
{"text":"I am new to Charlotte and this is my favorite restaurant so far. The food is out of this world and averages about $10 for a meal. They give you so much food. I get a dish for lunch and have it for dinner that night and lunch the next day. I love the atmosphere and there are great drink specials during the week."}
{"text":"Love this place, any time of day. Food is delish, just stay away from the desserts, always leave me wondering."}
{"text":"Rude and grossly understaffed restaurant.  Food is mediocre at best.  The manager is clueless to what his staff is doing.  With all the options uptown pick somewhere else to dine."}
{"text":"Anyone who has had pasta from a quaint mom and pop restaurant knows this is NOT great pasta. I ordered the ravioli and it left much to be desired. Yes the the pasta is pre cooked and but it was overlooked, tasteless and hard around the edges. I've had better pasta stations on college tours with my students. My money would've been better spent at an Olive Garden or another chain Italian restaurant. Was excited because of the concept but I'll never return nor recommend. In addition the cooks' conversations are not appropriate dialogue to have in front of guests. If it was a closed line kitchen sure but that's not the case."}
{"text":"Nice place to just hang out. Many options to choose from. I found the pasta to be ok. The desserts were good and we enjoyed them."}
{"text":"This place scores points for having a pleasant atmosphere and convenient ordering/seating system.  It is a spacious venue with high ceilings, a variety of tables that are regular and high seating, and a large bar area.    The ordering system is great for groups looking to split checks - they give each person a card which is swiped with each food or drink order and you pay upon exiting.  They have a variety of offerings including pastas, sandwiches, appetizers, soup, salads, pizzas, and desserts.  The pasta portions are really big.  If you are a fan of banana pudding this one is good.    The sangria was kind of gross because it was almost sickeningly sweet.  I also tried a glass of montepulciano but was again disappointed.  While the food prices are reasonable the drinks prices for wines by the glass are a bit steep.  Service was fairly non-existent but that's not a huge issue when you wait for your food at each station and serve yourself drinks (including water and alcohol)."}
{"text":"Great vibe and delicious food!! My kids loved the pizza in the shape of a fish."}
{"text":"Finding a parking spot is a hassle but this is such a cool restaurant! You go to the station of your choosing with your Vapiano credit card and they put what you order on that so you pay what is on the credit card at the end of your trip. That can be tricky so be sure not to overdo it cause the price adds up. But the food is great and you get large amounts while the price is extremely reasonable. I got a giant pasta dish and water for nine dollars. It's a very cool, no pressure atmosphere but the seating is a little uncomfortable and would not suggest it for older people because they would have trouble."}
{"text":"I'm honestly unsure which rating I should give. I came here one day and was blown away by the carbonara...it was almost as good as the dish I had in Italy. Then I came the following week and the same dish was essential pasta soaked in olive oil. I don't think there was any cheese in it, or garlic, or flavor for that matter. It was repulsive and in retrospect I probably should have brought it back. So, what I'm trying to say is based off my two experiences they are inconsistent.   The environment on the other hand is fabulous. It's just really pretty on the inside and I like the overall concept."}
{"text":"Interesting concept - you pick up a small card from the hostess and it \"stores\" your meal selections. You order from whichever food group choice you want - pizza/calzones, salad, pasta - by laying the card on a small screen and telling the person behind the countert which dish you'd like. Then you get a pager and go select a table.   The food was delicious - I had the Toscana pizza and part of my friend's salad. It would be nice if the salads came in smaller portions, but if sharing worked out for us.   The main drawback I found was that you don't have a server. I got up four times while having lunch - Once to get my order after they paged me, twice to refil my glass (the glasses are small), and another time to get a to-go box. I don't really care to interupt my lunch so many times. To be honest, I'd rather leave a tip for a server so that I don't have to get up (I'm not lazy, I swear!)."}
{"text":"This place is super fun. It's like a \"choose-your-own-adventure\" book. The main difference is you're writing the story each time you dine there. You can go there with a big group, a friend you're catching up with, or just by yourself -- it doesn't matter. When you arrive at Vapiano's the hostess/cashier will give you a swipe card. It looks like a credit card or a room key at a hotel.   You use this card to order food, grab a drink at the bar, and pay at the end of your experience. The first time I dined here, my impression of the place from beginning to end was constantly changing. I went from thinking this was a uber hip bar, to a super casual place to meet a friend ... to learning at the end of my experience that Vapiano's is a place where it can be can become a different experience every single time you visit. IT'S REALLY KIND OF COOL!  There's no \"wallet pressure\" if you come with a big group to order a dish within the same price range because you pay for \"ONLY\" what you order.   If you're feeling casual and want an individual margarita pizza with a side salad you can get that. AND, it's made for you right there-and-then on the spot.   If you want a fancy pasta dish they have that as well. The sauces are yummy and the seating is fun. You can sit by the bar and take in the \"hipster\" vibe, or sit outside and soak in the small city skyline, or you can sit inside at a table with fresh herbs as a centerpiece.  It's really just a fun, no pressure atmosphere, with a really great bonus which is --- REALLY GOOD FOOD. You'll actually crave it a few days or weeks later. AND, since you're paying only for what you've ordered, you choose if you break the bank during the meal or not.   I say go to Vapiano's not just for the food, or great drinks at the bar ... but also for the fun experience you'll have each time you go there. I hope you enjoy your experience there as much as I have!   Good luck on your Vapiano's adventure!"}
{"text":"I found this place so fun! You can order and customize your pasta. If you like a more interactive meal this is totally for you! If you're looking for a quite place where the waiters bring you everything this is not it! I went with a large group and we were all able to order and hang out easily!"}
{"text":"I have been  to Vapiano Charlotte several times and each experience has been one bad one after the next.My biggest issue is with the chefs they are disgusting they never wash their hands or change gloves and they touch raw meats and your pasta.eww gross! I prefer not to get ecoli with my chicken Alfredo thanks!  The foods  alright if you get a decent chef it's usually never consistent I'm guessing there's a high chef turnover.  The tables there aren't any cleaner as there's always dirty dishes or bugs crawling around I'm guessing cause of all the plants but hey if you want bugs in your food go ahead.the staff is rude and good luck trying to speak with a manager they never come to the phone .The young lady on the phone told me their not allowed to give them the phone they can only take messages.So as you can see they don't care about the customers.id prefer to take my money else where and bug free!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this places gets low ratings, I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Vapiano!  It is formatted just like everyone says- cafeteria style. You walk in to the \"hostess/cashier\" stand and she gives you a hotel key looking card, and you seat yourself. Perhaps around one of the live olive trees, or at a community table with miniature potted herbs. You then take your card with you to any of the stations (antipasti, salad, pasta, pizza, panini)  and tell the guy what you want off the menu. You can customize your meal to your desire, which is cool. With a swipe of your Vapiano card, you're off to your table with a pager to wait for your meal.   They make their pasta and sauces in house, so you can count on the pasta tasting fresh and delicious. They also cook it up right in front of you, made to order.  I got the pasta funghi this time- cream sauce with a mix of various mushrooms, and added chicken and pancetta to it. It was absolutely delcious. Probably some of the best pasta I've eaten in Charlotte, no lie. And the portion is big enough for leftovers (which reheat just as well as they came out the first time). I also decided i would try the Greek salad- also good, I like that they add capers and dill sprigs to the salad. Salads come served with fresh bread, and there are bottles of EVOO and balsamic at your table for dipping.   They have a full bar, featuring daily drink specials- Sunday being 1/2 price bottles of wine, which is just fine by me. You again tell the bartender what you want, swipe your card, and head back to your table with your beverages.   This concept is great- affordable (like under $10 a plate), quick, and delicious. Loved the \"upscale\" ambiance- it fits quite nicely downtown."}
{"text":"There is an inviting and relaxing atmosphere in general, restaurant managers are visible, personable and attentive to customers even in the midst of a large dining room area, bar conveniently stocked with choice liqueurs and a pleasant menu of specialty drinks, food menu is wonderful with options of pasta, pizza, panini and soup or salad (all customizable to customers taste). On the downside peak times of operation such as lunch and special events seem overwhelming leaving certain dishes such as pasta under prepared due to cooks being rush by long lines of anticipating diners, at times the traffic patterns inside the restaurant seem like a maze of blind mice. Although overall on any given night a great restaurant to dine, drink and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great, simple self serve concept. Price/value is excellent. Pesto pasta with sausage is simple fresh and hit the mark. Salads are crisp and fresh. Service is attentive and friendly.  Perfect when you want a relatively fast, fresh bite."}
{"text":"The scene along with the pizza at Vapiano  creates a very pleasant experience. I truly enjoy dining here for lunch, dinner and after work get-togethers. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Vapiano is like a beautiful little European import, (well, it IS a European concept)-- big on style, and big on being fresh and hip.  But like that BMW, you're going to have to contend with a lot of a certain kind of buyer, and pay a premium for those add-ons, like salad...er...I mean heated steering wheel.    Seriously though, this place serves a purpose: to serve the folks working in Uptown, so during lunch, it's like an adult cafeteria.  Long lines should be expected. Parking at peak times can also be a beast.   But the food itself, I think is quite yummy. The pastas for example, are all made to order, and the chefs at each station (like the pizza or salad station) make everything fresh before your eyes.  There's something satisfactory about watching a chef (or, I guess more like line cook) assemble your meal, and add sauces and mix and chop.   The place looks like an upscale cafeteria, and you'll definitely pay upscale cafeteria prices, that rival, let's say a Mama Ricotta's.  (I say MR's because it's Italian.)  To those who aren't thrilled about the despondent looking workers...I'd say not all of them have that dull stare.  It depends on who you get.    So yeah, I like Vapiano.  Never do I crave it...but when in Uptown...for a solid pasta and salad meal, without the hubbub of sitting down, ordering and being served, this is the place."}
{"text":"I've been to Vapiano about 7-8 times. The food is decent, if you get the right line cook to prepare it. It seems like they have high chef turnover. The drinks are also decent, and the bartenders have always been courteous and attentive.   I decided that I won't be returning after my visit today. Brought my whole family and when we went to pay our bill, the credit card machine was \"down\". The cashier, in a very rude manner, informed us we would have to pay cash. None of us had cash. One member of our party ventured a few blocks to the atm, and while he was gone, I noticed another patron signing a credit card receipt. I asked the hostess if the machine was working again, and she simply said \"yes\".   So she couldn't mention it was working again? And was the rude attitude necessary? That's enough to turn me off from the business. Too many other good places to eat in Charlotte. We spent over $100 there today and were treated like crap. We complained to the manager on duty, who was also quite rude, and left.   Good luck."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a really interesting experience as it has a unique concept.  Order your Italian food directly with the cook and he prepares it in front of you. The Italian entrées are delicious, very fresh and considering the relatively low price, food is wonderful.  This was my first visit to the restaurant but I would definitely come here again. The chefs that made my food were named Chris and Marvin. They did a nice job and have great personalities."}
{"text":"What a great spot for a business lunch with multiple agendas!  The open layout of Vapiano affords patrons the opportunity to intermingle without hesitation.  The atmosphere is light and bristling with a restrained temerity.  First timers will need to pay attention when they're greeted or they'll be lost.  You'll get a card that places all your purchases on it.  You go where you want, get what you want, and pay at the front when you're ready to leave.  You're a big boy...you can do it.  The food here is nice.  I've only had the pizza and salads and haven't been disappointed.  Every employee I've encountered had been more than helpful.  My only advice to Vapiano would be concerning the pizza condiments at the end of the pizza counter.  A spoon and a container of crushed red pepper make for a difficult experience when putting red pepper on your pizza.    Overall, Vapiano is bustling, fragrant, and a comfortable experience.  Give it a try.  I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went today for my first visit and doubt I will go back. I booked a reservation for 14 earlier in the week. When we got there the table on sat 12. I asked the hostess if there was another place to sit. She replied \"no\" and that was it. I got my group settled and then found a few small tables myself and put them together. No one came by to apologize or even check on things. I did ask for him at the end of the meal and explained to him what happened. At that time he said this normally doesn't happen, it was the opening manager that didn't set it up properly and apologized. All in all, not a good experience. If the food had been special perhaps I would go back, but it wasn't, so I won't."}
{"text":"I am sure the pizza/pasta is great, but I haven't been able to get past the Chicken Caesar Salad.... My favorite :)"}
{"text":"Walked by this place as we were staying downtown.  We thought it would be a nice Italian place, but as we walked in and were told how to do it, we were hesitant but continued to the counters.  The pastas to choose from were a nice selection, and they do a nice white wine sauce with a lot of garlic, which I love.  The bread was really good too, nice and crisp on the outside and chewy in the inside.  Everyone enjoyed their food, from the calzones to the pastas.  Definitely going back here when I'm back downtown."}
{"text":"Always good... No matter what we get... Cooks are great, desserts (cheesecake) with strawberries is the perfect end, outdoor seating on a busy street makes it all the more interesting."}
{"text":"For those unfamiliar with Vapiano, it's an international chain and their Charlotte location leaves a lot to be desired. The food is extremely greasy and poorly seasoned. Considering this is Charlotte, I was shocked that the staff there are so unfriendly.  The management here could learn so much from the locations in DC. Also, is that styrofoam they're still using? Vapiano Charlotte, maybe consider those awesome containers being used in locations elsewhere? They're recyclable and pretty sweet."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker i wasn't sure what really to expect when I came here. First the staff is extra friendly and professional. I loved the service. The place is so modern and mature yet elegant. Second the food choices were great and everything was reasonably priced including the drinks. Thirdly the food was amazing. If you love Italian food you're gonna love this place beyond words to explain. So so good. My bartender was AMAZING. They didn't have the drink I requested but she made it anyway and it was better than anything I've had since I moved here. I'll be back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.   Restaurant is a European style self serve cafeteria but in a very comfortable modern eatery.  Getting use to self serve aspect gets a little to get use to but the staff was very friendly and food was great.  I can't wait to eat here next time I'm uptown."}
{"text":"Whether seeking a dining experience or just wanting to grab a delicious quick bite, Vapianos doesn't disappoint.  Ordering is the only thing cafeteria style. All food is cooked to custom order within view. There are those food snobs that may consider cafeteria style dining a negative but not here. The tables are big, comfortable and loaded with oils and vinegars to dip your fresh bread.  I've never had a bad meal here. Always just like I want it. Today I had Caesar salad with shrimp & coconut curry soup (thin-not chunky). The Caesar dressing is house made with anchovies...perfect. Unimprovable. A fresh squeeze of lemon made it pop.  The soup had just the right amount of coconut and curry. Milder not too spicy.   Staff are all fantastic and ready to help.  The atmosphere is fun and child friendly. Bathrooms were very clean and updated. Nice. Arrived at 11:15 am and by 12:15 place was packed with business clientele. Was quite loud. This may be important to you."}
{"text":"Great place for  lunch with your girl ,nice set up ,pasta  and crayfish  add shrimp  sausage& mushrooms  ( That's all me playa! )"}
{"text":"In terms of convenience, Vapianos has it all: great location (walkable from most uptown office buildings and apartments), large seating area and bar and something for everyone. The service, however, makes this location worth missing. I have frequently waited 25+ minutes for a Caesar salad to go, and on two occasions, the man at the salad station forgot to make my food entirely. There was also one occasion where I ordered my dressing on the side, and the man at the counter told me he would not remake my salad (i.e. put lettuce in a different container and add crotons). Worth noting that this has been the same man every time. The food is ok, a bit overpriced for what you get, but if you are in a hurry, or value the correctness of your order, do not come here. I suggest the restaurant find someone new to work the salad counter ASAP!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, long wait, terrible cold food and now my husband & I have food poisoning. I second all of the negative comments here about rude chefs & servers & bad food. It may have been decent at one point but has really declined. Never again."}
{"text":"As good as the rest of Vapianos. Good place for have fast food but with more quality than the typical place."}
{"text":"We went to Vapiano's after seeing a show at Blumenthal Performing Arts Center because it was close by and it was open until 11:00pm on a weekday. It was my first time and I was confused with the set up but a couple of the girls with us had been there before. It's a beautiful place. We walked in, got a card from the hostess at the front, found seating, grabbed a menu and then you go to the station of your choice. I went to the pasta station first, they scanned my card and I ordered my pasta with olive oil, chili peppers, garlic and black pepper, hold the cheese. I then went to the salad station where this young lady was cleaning some equipment and didn't seem thrilled that I wanted a salad. I ordered two garden salad all the while getting the, you're bugging me and I want to go back to cleaning so I can get out here look! Oh well! I am a certified servsafe manager which means I took a course on food safety and handling and passed with flying colors. I noticed she didn't wash her hands although she did change her gloves.  Pasta was delicious and I actually ordered more. This time one with a red sauce, extra chilies and again, very good. I never order pasta when I eat out because it so cheap and easy to make at home but I broke tradition and went for it.  My daughter had the shrimp Alfredo pasta, loved it! Her friend had the calzone, huge!! But they put a small tomato in the middle to keep it puffed up so it looks like it's filled with stuff but it's really just a tomato causing the illusion. Ha! Good one.  So everything you order gets scanned on the card and when you are done you go to the checkout with your card and pay. Definitely an honor system kind of set up.  So don't walk out without paying folks! It's stealing! LOL!  This place is definitely worth a visit! Check it out!  That is all!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a fabulous idea, but the self-service could be trouble if it was extremely crowded. When we were there there was some event and the bar was extremely crowded. Still, the food was very good and we enjoyed the experience. They have an excellent selection of food and drinks, which should satisfy anyone. We tried the spicy orange salad, which was fine for a salad, but nothing special. The carbonara and pizza were excellent, and the prices were unexpectedly cheap. Coo. atmosphere too. Deserts are pre-made, at the bar, and we tried the white chocolate mouse, which was very good. Overall a great experience and highly recommended. However, if you are in the mood for a relaxing meal, this might not be the right place. Ordering and picking up your own food might not be good if you've had a rough day. 3/22/12"}
{"text":"Loved the concept and the food.  Yes, you do have to get your own drinks and food but I found that despite it being quite busy in the restaurant on a Friday night we had a shorter wait time than what I've experienced in normal restaurants.  Highly recommend the prosciutto pizza and chicken alfredo pasta.  I wasn't a big fan of the bread served with the pasta but that is a taste preference where I prefer my bread warm.  The prices were very reasonable and the restaurant had an overall cool/laid back ambiance."}
{"text":"OK, so I've been here a few times since my first review, and it appears they have ironed out some kinks.    Food quality is much more consistent.  I also feel like the portions I've gotten the last few times have gotten better as well.  Good to see that they brought the quantity to be more in line with their prices!  Also, I believe their flatbread pizzas to be a MUCH better deal than their pastas/salads.  Very reasonable for the size and quality product that their pizzas obviously have.  Still pricey, but it's decent food that's gotten ALOT better since my first trip."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, great looking menu with tons of different custom pastas and pizzas, lots of seating"}
{"text":"Vapiano is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Everything I've had, whether pizza, pasta, appetizers or dessert, has been equally delicious and well presented. The pasta is made in-house, and other ingredients may be as well. The desserts are off-the-charts, a must try.  There's never any problem finding a seat. The wait for the food is not too shabby and perfectly acceptable as the setting makes for good vibes and plentiful conversation.  If you are looking for a great place to eat at a VERY reasonable price, give Vapiano a try. The negative reviews I've read appear to come from people who have underlying personal issues that create problems everywhere they go. Disregard those comments and go enjoy some good food and a cool dining experience."}
{"text":"Worst italian ever. Tasteless food. Even the tomato soup tastes like some horrible marinara sauce. Bruschettas were hard as rock. They couldn't get the order right and in the end gave aglio olio pasta which wasnt properly cooked."}
{"text":"Now I go vapiano whenever I can and I always order the salmon carbonara  and is good . Now today I order the bolognese and well I have been cooking since I was 15 and a culinary student I would like say ...... The pasta is overcooked causing the pasta  to form a cluster .pasta is suppose to be light and easy to grab with the fork . I ask for onion and did not get any . The sauce is lacking seasoning because it Taste blend very much so . I don't even taste the salt . For a restaurant that is suppose to be fresh , I am highly disappointed in the pasta . I wasted 12$ on this and I can't eat it . I'm so angry I can't even go back ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here used to be classy and now I feel like I need to watch my purse. Quality of the food has declined. It's noisy and echoey. Pasta WAY overdone. Pizza not impressive. This place had merit with the food and drink quality the last 10 times I was here but they have switched to catering to a crowd that obviously doesn't care about quality. Boooooo!!!"}
{"text":"I love going to Vapiano the decor and atmosphere are great and I love the cafeteria style dinning. The cards that each customer gets to order are great when you go with a group of friends and you don't have to split the bill because everyone essentially has their own tab.  Over the last few years that I've lived in uptown I've tried a lot of different foods Vapiano offers everything taste great; salads, pasta, pizza, the customer service however is hit or miss. The hostesses are always nice and welcoming but some chefs behind the glass are very rude. Also when you're paying look for the gummy bear container, they have little to go cups if you'd like to take gummy bears with you :)"}
{"text":"This place get's 4 stars.  Why? 3 seems kind of Harsh...   Things I like about it: It's great for lunch. The pasta is the thing to get - its made from scratch on premise. The price for the pasta (skipping the meat) is pretty good. It's actually pretty fast.  Things I don't like: The pizza... It takes too long and its not worth the cost or the wait. The card system is a bit irritating. The way they make you wait in line.  I would not recommend this place for dinner - unless its a weeknight and you know what you are buying.  Some facts about me: I can't comment on the salad because I haven't tried it. I have been here 3 times. 1st i tried the Pizza - then I switched to the pasta and haven't looked back. I love home made pasta with any sort of fresh made from scratch sauce.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really unique spot. Vapiano has a real modern feel. I've only had the pasta dishes. They make the dish right in front of you and you can customize to fit your needs.  If you haven't experienced Vapiano's I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in Charlotte. Freshly made pasta. Cooked to order. Mmm. They have a unique process - no servers. If you want to be wined and dined this probably isn't it. You walk up to the chef and bartender personally to request your food."}
{"text":"Vapiano is such a cool atmosphere! I love the greenery inside and the laidback feel. Prices are super reasonable and so far everything I've had there has been great."}
{"text":"Vapiano is amazing. The food is incredible and the setting is even better, if that's possible. Total cafeteria feel but in the absolute best way possible. My boss and I joke about only allowing ourselves to go here once a week. So yummy. Will go back, again and again and again."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about Vapiano.  I had been to a different location in DC and really enjoyed it, but that might have been because I had my boyfriend wait in all the lines while I lounged, ha. We recently visited the Charlotte Uptown location using a Groupon.  I really don't mind the concept of cafeteria style and using the swipe card to tally your bill. It's the waiting in line I loathe. So, it was probably a mistake to come here on a Friday night at 8pm... it was PACKED. I waited in line over 10 minutes just to order a salad. Okay, so not too crazy, but my boyfriend was in the pasta line ordering for both of us, it had to have been at least 25 minutes. I was pretty pissed at the restaurant at this point, having to wait by myself at our table.  On a positive note, this atmosphere is super cool. I love the decor, chalk board art, trees, red accents. And even though the wait was extremely too long, the food was delish!  Pasta is made fresh daily. I ordered PESTO E SPINACI, very very good. My favorite however was the STRAWBERRY SPINACH SALAD. I'm all about the FCN salads (fruit, cheese, nut)! I highly recommend this salad to anyone!   We ordered the BRUSCHETTA TRIO as an appetizer, very good. Super hearty bread, fresh tomatoes, and fresh shaved cheese. You definitely get a good deal for the quality of the food.  I will come back here, but ONLY on a weekday. Props for vegetarian friendly food. Parking sucks, but that goes with anywhere uptown I guess.  UPDATE: This place is sooooooo much better on a weekday or very early on the weekend. I love the quality and the freshness of the food. Holla!"}
{"text":"Good food I had a pizza new York style hand tossed and the crust was great.  Sangria was very tasty and had their own take on it which was well done.  Atmosphere is fantastic.  You start with a card and get what you want. They put it all on the card so when you are ready to go just take it up front and cash out. Yeah you might lose track but that is up to you I guess."}
{"text":"Vapiano is an \"ok\" spot. I'm a huge pizza fan. Sadly, I've had much better. I love the thin crust, it just has zero flavor. You may come out better with the pasta dishes. The concept (elevated cafeteria style) is really cool and the location is great for a meal uptown. They also have live music some Saturdays. Call for the dates."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Pasta is very good. They have a smoked salmon pasta dish that is excellent and made right in front of you when you order. One tip for water drinkers is that water and citrus water is over at the bar."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with a few friends. I got a shrimp and chicken Alfredo, while they ordered their own versions. Each of their dishes looked delicious, and mine was just as tasty. It was a pretty large plate, so I took my remainder home. The gummy bears were good too!"}
{"text":"As most Yelpers have explained, the premise on this one is a little unique.  You come in and get a card and whatever you order, you put on that card.  When you leave, you give the card to the hostess at the front and she uses it to determine what you bought/your bill.  Throughout the restaurant they have various stations (bar, pizza, pasta, ETC.).    We stopped in for a drink before heading to a game a BOA stadium.  The food did look delicious...maybe next time!  I got a sangria (red) and it was good.    I will say the service at the bar was pretty slow.  They only had one bartender on duty and maybe in the future they should have at least two when there is a game on the schedule.  Overall, if I was in the area I would stop by again."}
{"text":"I don't love the card system that Vapiano uses; it can be a little confusing as to where you're supposed to order, and a few time there have been issues with the charges on my card (they'll charge me twice or forget to charge me). The atomosphere feels a little hectic since there are people trying to stay and eat there and a lot of people getting food to-go, and it's a mixed crowd because it's not a su[er nice restaurant, but it's clearly trying to attract a higher-end clientelle that will spend $ at the bar.   The food is decent; I like that they make everything in front of you so you have control over how much of each ingredient goes into your dish. I wasn't ever blown away with the quality though, and my meals haven't been consistent (sometimes they drown my pasta in sauce and other times there hardly any toppings, which is why I started watching them make it and ask for more/less sauce/toppings). Overall, not too expensive, but not somewhere I'd want to sit-down to eat."}
{"text":"PERFECT for big groups and the food never disappoints. Great place to meet up and grab a quick dinner before going to a game or an event at night. Highly recommend for people who have never been!"}
{"text":"Vapiano's is inconsistent.  Great food most of the time (Chicken Alfredo pasta and pizza are delicious most of the time - look for Pierre as he is the best chef I've had and always consistent), good prices, especially for Uptown Charlotte, large portion sizes.  When you leave, Gummy Bears are handed out - the unfortunate thing is for some reason they do not have gummy bears every day.  On one visit I asked a server why the gummy bears are so inconsistent and he replied \"we just didn't have time to make them\".  In my opinion, such a unique and great ending to a meal should not be overlooked - especially when the quality of food or attitudes of the servers can be so inconsistent."}
{"text":"No clue how the food is, could not get a pasta chef to acknowledge my presence. The only person standing in front of three chefs, they wouldn't even say hello or look at me. As other women walked up, no idea what they wanted, the chefs would wave them over and wait on them and continue to ignore me. I walked a half mile for this?  Have eaten in Vapianos all across the US and in Europe, will not be returning to the Charlotte location."}
{"text":"Best pasta ever!!!!!! This place is nice and has good vibes. Good for birthday dinners or dates."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE the pasta! I would give Vapiano's 5 stars, last time I was in there, my friend and I ordered from 2 stations next to each other, and the guys who prepared his food gave him really poor service.   I usually go to the same person if he's there (sorry I can't remember his name) and my pasta is perfect every time. I'll tend to agree with others that they're not the most friendly, but since I only have to deal with them to order my food and my food is DELICIOUS, I don't mind as much.   I've never had the non-pasta options, so I'll have to review again when I try them."}
{"text":"This was my third time here and again I was not disappointed over all. The problem for me is that nothing is so incredible that I think about it afterward. However...  The concept is different and fun and it works.  You get a card that you scan at each station so you can eat at your leisure.  Then pay at the end.  The downside is that it's easy to forget how much you are spending!  We started with bruchetta, which was good, as usual.  You get two slices of bread with a generous portion of bruchetta.  Just enough for one or two people.  My step daughter had chicken fettuccine and thought it was very good.  I'm not a fettuccine fan, but found it to be better than average.  My fiancée had the cheese and spinach ravioli and it was great.  Their sauce is wonderful and of our three dishes, I liked it the best.  I ordered the Italian Thai and found it to be good but not as flavorful as I'd hoped, considering it is one of the most expensive items.  We finished with a very tasty tiramisu that we split three ways.  My step daughter is a picky eater and she really liked the experience.  As for me, Nothing to complain about and I'll definitely return!  Oh yeah...ALWAYS get their house Sangria!   It's the best!"}
{"text":"Vapiano always satisfies my chicken carbonara cravings. I love the ambiance here. The food has a lot of flavor. We tried the coconut curry soup today and that was great. The gummy bears on the way out are a nice touch.   Cruz is very friendly and makes a mean ravioli. :)"}
{"text":"Solid lunch pick.  Very consistent.  I don't get here very often because of the calorie count, but I'd eat here once a week if I could.  If you are looking for fast but good Italian this is the spot.  The only problem is having to decide if I want pizza or pasta.  Can I just eat both?  My daughter also loves this place and sometimes makes me go to Uptown just so we can go here.  I avoid Uptown at all costs outside of working hours, but I have to make an exception for her."}
{"text":"I love love their food. Pasta, pizza or sangria. I have the pesto e spinach almost everytime."}
{"text":"All reviews are based on price point....  Needed a long walk in the early evening to brush off the long, hard days in the office.  Ended up here because we have been eating large, expensive dinners and this place was a lunch choice on another visit and we enjoyed our food.  A bowl of well made potatoe soup and a plate of pasta, shrimp, lemon, and spinach was the choices.  The soup was very good, hot, and pureed vs lumpy, sometime cheesy, potatoe soup.   The pasta fish was very well made.  I was clear to the preparer that less dressing is nearly always better and she deftly made the sauce just to the right proportion.  I am not sure if you can beat the prices in the downtown, make that uptown, area.  Kinda Italian semi fast food that is well prepared.  A good combination!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was good but the concept was hard to understand and it took us a while to get used to the style of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My family LOVES Vapiano! The food is excellent and the card system is so nice because you don't have to wait for your check!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the service has declined significantly in the last year. While I still like the food, the chefs are ridiculously slow, sometimes bad tempered and seemingly uncaring about the growing line waiting to order while they slowly stir and chat with each other. I have walked out numerous times after waiting an unreasonable amount of time.   If it takes 10 minutes or more for them to cook your meal after you've ordered, it's really annoying to stand around for 20 minutes just waiting to order. Management needs to keep a closer eye on staffing as well as demeanor of the staff, as I know plenty of business people who won't go here because of these issues.  It doesn't seem reasonable for only one pasta chef station to be open with 5+ people in line waiting to order, and yet there are many other employees cleaning stations and prepping to leave.   Despite those annoyances, the pasta is still amazing when I do decide to wait around for it. My standard order: carbonara with onion, garlic, Serrano peppers, sundried tomatoes and oven roasted tomatoes. It's amazing every time.   I would come more often if management would resolve the problematic staffing or ordering issues."}
{"text":"This place is alright at best, in my opinion. I ate here while in town and really didn't feel like a cafeteria styled dining experience. It was late and the place looked nice from the outside and wasn't too crowded. Well, they hand you cards to keep up with the food you purchase. You stand in line order and wait on your food and then find a spot to sit. I like the layout of the spot, but I would rather have a waitstaff person doing the majority of the work (just my preference).   I had a side caesar salad and a salmon pasta dish that wasn't too flavorful. It was more than what I cared to pay for on such a bland meal."}
{"text":"Love this place, I love everything from the concept (card) to the set up with the fresh live herb plants on each table and the seat yourself set up. I really appreciate the ability to reserve tables for my birthday when I had 20ppl in town to celebrate and wanted to ensure that we had somewhere to go and not wait in line for food and the extra great part was that after dinner the place turned into a lounge with music and dancing so we had a one stop cover all. All the guest really enjoyed their food and the concept which made it much easier than splitting checks when in a large group. We all had various things from various stations however my family and I have been back several times and tried different stations and our favorite items (The husband and I ) come from the Salad and Pasta station, however our teenagers like the Pizza bar. The food is extremely FRESH and full of flavor and it's okay to speak with your cook and ask them to add a little more of something or less of something to customize it for your liking. I also look to them for the proper pasta selection when choosing dishes since they know may flow better. I enjoy my time there each visit, I only had one issue when dining that I won't go into because it was rectified which is why this is a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for work and this was the perfect downtown location to have dinner.  You walk in and the friendly hostess gave me a card to use at the different stations to put my order on. It acts almost like a credit card and you pay the balance when you leave.  I went to the soup and salad station and ordered the Greek salad and a cup of the soup of the day which was a cream of asparagus.  You take a pager and can have a seat anywhere you like. This is one fancy café and the décor is all very modern. I sat at the bar and ordered a red sangria which they are known for while I waited. Yes it  was tasty and I highly recommend. The wait was not long at all for my food.  The soup was fantastic and had a great flavor. My salad was just ok as I had very large chunks of the lettuce core that you cannot eat in the salad.  The bartender was great and I would like to go back to try some of their pizza and pasta entrees."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Food can be hit or miss. The pizzas are great. The way the orders are done using a card is great! Feels like a college cafeteria, in a good way."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get really great pasta dishes. I absolutely love the décor & the vibe inside. I always get the pesto pasta, it is simply delicious! I love that they make it fresh to order and you can watch too!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. The setup was just really awkward. I can see how having the scan card can help with orders but I think execution was a bit confusing and slow during check out. Also, the pizza maker gave me my pizza in an overly sized box, and seeing no servers around I didn't know what to do with it after I'd finished eating since there are no visible trash cans in the establishment. Then, when I had to go to the restroom before I checked out, a server came to ask if there was anyone in the bathroom because his manager asked because they didn't want anyone stiffing on their bill. Being that I was the only adult person in the bathroom at that time, I thought that was really rude and offensive. I proceeded to pay and tipped Ok, but this place is awkward and thankfully as I don't live in Charlotte and was only here for layover, will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Does this look worth $10.77?  No dressing after specifically asking for balsamic, and a thrown together salad with 2 ounces of salmon for $4. Disappointing, dry salad which was nothing but a rip off."}
{"text":"So...I didn't know they had Gumbo. It's was outstanding. I would definitely refer to a friend."}
{"text":"This was my first dining experience at Vapiano. The pizza was fantastic, although i felt that the pizza maker had an attitude when taking my order (i had several revisions), and when i returned the buzzer she seemed agitated that i didn't know to drop it in the basket. I loved the ambiance and food, the drinks were mediocre (we asked for a Moscow mule...it tasted sweet and was red .,.).   Upon paying for our bill i found the host (guy with locs) to be very unpleasant and rude. His nails were chipped and he did not make eye contact with us or even thank us for coming. He was too busy stapling receipts. Every bit of rapport we tried to build with him was shot down with a condescending remark and/or expression. There were no pleasantries at all especially being that it is the holiday season and the place looked so pretty.   There was also a guy dancing non stop around the restaurant....he seemed to have worked there ...  Great food and ambiance. Service has opportunity."}
{"text":"Recently ate dinner here and I enjoyed the place. I am a very health conscious eater and the fresh salads along with homemade dressing was great. There was plenty of selections for my wife and 5 year old. I like the way you obtain your food and the service was quite quick. Overall this was a pretty good place to catch a bite to eat. The overall price for a meal was quite reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Only been there once but I will certainly be back again when I am back in town. I got a pesto pasta with shrimp and a side salad. The portion is big, so I had leftover for dinner the next day. I will definitely be back again because the pasta was so good! My coworker got a salad and the portion is huge to.  I like the concept that you use the card to record your orders at each station and don't pay until the end. However, it is dangerous to not know how much you spent until the very end, (especially after a few drinks lol)....but I guess that's no different from a sit down restaurant.  P.s The ambience of the place is nice."}
{"text":"Dear Vapiano, You're like a flighty ex lover.  Each time I run into you I am taken by your beauty and charm and remember how tasty you are.  But I can never figure you out and in the end I'm frustrated and down a few dollars.    Ive been in 3 or 4 times in the last 3 or 4 years and each time I'm given a card to do what with now?  Give it to someone and then bring it back?  Nevermind I'll figure it out later.  Then I walk towards the delicious smelling food and am immediately reminded why I haven't been here in a year.  I have no idea how to actually get the food.  There is just a mass of people (business is good!).  Those people are smiling and happy and pleasant but they are just standing around.  Its like I've wandering into a party thats been going on for some time where everyone is cooler and younger than me and I'm lost and confused.  The pizza looks good, do i just muscle infront of everyone, do i just grab a pizza, do i order one?  I honestly still don't know.  So then i move towards the salads, but this is even more people just standing around.  Then i move towards the pasta.  Can't go wrong with pasta.  I study the situation, ask a few people and it appears that you play innie meanie minnie moe and pick a chef.  then you stand behind a few people but directly infront of the chef and hope that sometime soon he or she will make eye contact to give you some hope that you are standing in the correct spot.  They have never made eye contact with me.  Then  i usually see a manager and beg for help.  In the past the manager has spoken with the chef and directed the chef to take my order.  If i make it this far, the food is prepared after too many questions and I do something with the card and have a nice meal."}
{"text":"For a chain quick eatery it is great. The people here and super friendly and it is easy quick service. The food isn't incredibly compelling"}
{"text":"Vapiano's is just okay. Given that I don't work uptown, and coming uptown and trying to find parking around lunch is as frustrating as it is, Vapiano's, would never be be where I choose to ever go.  Anyways, been here twice. It is cafeteria style like all the other reviews mentioned and has a fun loungey but modern vibe. They, supposedly, and rather publicly, make their own pasta and grow all their herbs. Funny how they always seem to be pressing pasta and rolling herbs in the cart during lunch rush...speaking of lunch rush tables are hard to come by if you come right at noon. You are able to reserve them, though!  The portions are good but it is a little on the expensive side for the quality. I do enjoy the bread (served hot!) and love that they have oil and vinegar on the table for dipping.   I've gotten the caprese pizza and the turkey club panini and have been let me down both times. They just seem to skimp on the toppings and \"extras\" (see picture of turkey club with tiny bit of prosciutto). Lunch mate had maybe 4 olive slices on the whole damn pizza.  They only have a few panini options and no bread choices. The pasta and pizza menus are pretty size able, though. The side salad, which come with the paninis, is iceberg lettuce and they will not ask your dressing option.   Overall, like I said, this would never be somewhere I would choose to go given all the other many wonderful options in the area, but it's quick and they put on a pretty good show."}
{"text":"The staff and bartenders are rude. The food gave me and my friend food poisoning. Couldn't even drink the beverage I ordered bc it taste so bad. I've had terrible experiences here twice now and I would never go back if you paid me. If you're in uptown go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This was our second time coming to Vapiano! The first time was 5 years ago and when we returned to Charlotte, it was on our MUST DO list! The food is excellent, fresh, and properly prepared! The chefs make sure to answer any questions you may have. The atmosphere is great for date night, girl's night, or any occasion for celebration."}
{"text":"Has potential to be much more than it is. Too much of a factory feel given how many people visit for lunch during weekdays - I wonder if they all like it or take it to be what good food is?  I had the pesto basil pasta. Turned out very dry, not spicy despite the cook telling me that its spicy already when I asked her to add more green chilis. Reviews were pretty much the same across the table for the 6-7 of us who had lunch there."}
{"text":"Interesting place, loved the concept of cafeteria style/help yourself.  Nice atmosphere, great place for meeting with friends for drinks/dinner"}
{"text":"MEH.  I was first super excited to see that there was a Vapiano in downtown Charlotte having just discovered the one in downtown NYC.  The one in NYC is super chic, always busy, and urban with a downtown vibe.  This one is downtown Charlotte is nice - modern interior & furniture with a patio, large bar and some nice lounge seating.  BUT it's a lot more open than the NYC location - no upstairs location, less tables, and less people - that's for sure.  You don't get the same busy popping vibe as you would in NYC.  But that's Charlotte for you - this location closes at midnight (MIDNIGHT people, the night doesn't even start until then) and the surrounding bars close around 2, so... what can you do.  Also, I ordered the same exact item I ordered from NYC Vapiano at this location - a Bruschetta pizza - but I was severely disappointed with the Charlotte location's.  The chef just handed me a cheese pizza... with 4 pieces of basil on it.  Whaat?  That's not bruschetta.  But I'm keeping an open mind and maybe sometime in the future, I'll drop by again and see if they can do any better."}
{"text":"How anyone can give this place any less than 5 stars, blows my mind!!! This place has the most amazing pasta I have ever tasted!  They cook it fresh right in front of you. I am riding with my husband on business simply to eat here. I really don't want to do this review as I don't want to wait when I go there. However, everyone should go here! I live in South Carolina and don't live close...thank God!  I would weigh a thousand pounds from eating here every night!"}
{"text":"Vapiano is so-so. I got a garlic something pizza last time and the amount of garlic on it was unbearable. I love garlic but it was way too much and the pizza was burnt. Usually though its a safe bet to go to Vapiano for a decent work break lunch for 10$ or less. I work across the street so its the closest option but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Its a cool concept and has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Love the feel of this place. The trendy/modern decor is awesome, and adds to the experience. The prices are great, and the portions are even better! Head here on a Sunday night to take advantage of half-priced bottles of wine!   This is the perfect place to take your out-of-town friends if you want to show them Uptown and take them too a \"cool\" place without breaking the bank! I love that you walk up and actually order your food from the chefs and can watch them cook it in front of you."}
{"text":"Went for dessert & drinks.  Bar service was a slow & desserts were meh.  Did like the location & that the front walls opened to the street, but that isn't enough to get me to go back. Too many other great options around the area to settle for meh."}
{"text":"We and another couple tried this place out back in March. Better late than never for this review..:) Love the decor. We enjoyed the  live music the evening we went. They claimed to have bar specials, yet when I asked she mentioned just the one martini. Last I checked, specials= plural.. anyway our drinks were good, not great. Not a lot of variety.  This was our first time, so wished someone would have told us about the portions. We could have easily split a pasta entree&salad. Service was decent and the check-out cashiers could pick up the pace. We liked the vibe and would return--just not a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Vapiano serves overall good food that is made right in front of you.  After you slide the card, you can basically awkwardly watch them cook your food; this is the time to ask for additional stuff or to make sure to leave out stuff.  I have noticed that certain cooks tend to be more above-and-beyond than others, while some may have an off day and your food could be just better; so its best if you frequent here to get to know the cook a little bit to improve your food.  Generally, the pasta is pretty good, though I wasn't that happy with the calzone I got once (was cold inside, while hot outside).  During lunch time it can get really busy as people wait in line to be served; the bar area is mostly empty at this time, plenty of seating.  Televisions are the bar area usually on sports.  Pay as you leave with the card you used to order your meal; the price tag is higher than average lunch fair, so spend accordingly.  Overall, it's okay... as some failings that can be better, but still worth a go."}
{"text":"A friend and i decided to stop by Vapiano after watching \"The Nutcracker\" ballet. The interior is well designed with modern decor, creating a pretty trendy atmosphere. This is about the only good thing I can say about the place.  The concept seemed interesting. When you walk in, you are greeted by the host that hands you a card (much like a credit card) and a menu. Once you decide what you want, you go to the appropriate station to order. It reminded me of being in elementary all over again, standing in cafeteria lines.  Since the concept is new, I think it would make sense if there were some form of an info-graphic to inform customers on how the restaurant operates. During our visit, two other customers questioned us on how to order. Furthermore, we were not sure if we were suppose to wait for our food or if someone would bring it to us.   Once we got the food (by the way, you go back up to get your food), it was a huge disappoint. It was so BLAND, absolutely flavorless! My friend got the Primavera Specialty Pasta, with added shrimp, and I got the Chicken Pesto Panini. Both dishes were flavorless. The pasta was basically boiled noodles with veggies. No spices. No sauces. No flavor. We had to ask the cook for some sauce (which was basically some form of tomato soup). My chicken was completely dry. We both added balsamic vinegar (A LOT) to our dishes to have.. oh what's it called... flavor! It was probably the worst \"Italian\" \"food\" I have ever had in my life.  The food is very inexpensive for uptown, but it is also of very poor quality for uptown. Sorry, can't say that we will be coming back =/"}
{"text":"One of the BEST lunch experiences I have had in a very long time.   The execution of my meal was spot on!   To bad we do not have one in Grand Rapids, MI.     I highly recommend experiencing this wonderful eatery.   Two thumbs & two big toes up!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I don't think I have ever enjoyed pasta this much in my whole life!  The restaurant is spacious with a bar, outside seating, lounge area and food court style dining area. The design and very fresh and new, they have little plants and lamps on each table. My first time there was on a Thursday night around 8:30 and they had a live DJ.   The restaurant has an interesting business model - each person is given a card to keep track of how much you spend and you just swipe your card at each station. Due to this, I thought each plate would be small and you just get multiple dishes and keep track on the card as you go. But it is not the case.   There are many different kinds of pasta on the menu, so I just told the chef I would like a pasta with basil, garlic, tomato, and some chicken. The chef told me that it would be the tomato pasta, which was not the regular spaghetti sauce, but pasta with tomatoes, and he can add whatever ingredient I want, and I can choose one of their many pasta choices.   The chef started cutting the tomatoes, Basil, garlic-- everything was made fresh, and he cooked it right in front of me! I was drooling as I watched him cook.   The food was just amazing! The fresh-cut ingredients with home-made pasta cooked in olive oil, and the taste of basil, garlic and a touch of parmesan cheese on top that just melted your taste buds.   The best part? it was only $7 for such a fine dish! It comes with homemade bread as well! I wasn't that impressed with the bread though.   In the end, I was a happy customer and I would strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. The pasta makers are super friendly and will make the order to your specification. I love to have them make their favorite. I've had lots of great experiences here.  Plus, their creme brule is amazing! Better than Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"I am going against the grain .... This was one of the greatest  food experiences I can remember the pasta is fresh food cooked to order and excellent customer service. I'll be back and bringing friends too."}
{"text":"Was in town for business and met some friends here for dinner. The food was delicious! I had a panini while others had pasta and pizza. Love the upscale cafeteria feel and the decent prices. Super cute concept and fresh food - wish we had one in CT!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time it was awesome! We can't wait to return and try another dish. I liked seeing the fresh pasta being made"}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is different, modern and friendly.  I must say \"GET the Spicy Scampi Orange Fennel Salad. The salad itself is 379 calories and is extremely filling. I felt this place is on my \"Come Back SOON\" list. The ambiance is modern, the customer service is great, and the menu is bountiful. Don't forget to get some gummy bears on your way in because you'll be too full to eat them on the way out!!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here for Brunch on Saturday. We sat outside which had a nice view of the city buildings. We all had the $30 special which included bottomless mimosas, an appetizer & an entree. I had the mussels & tried some calamari. Both were amazing. I got the salon entree which was good however, I asked for medium and it was a little under. The veggies weren't so great. But our waiter Chris was amazing & I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very upscale and comfort food. They should consider expanding the lunch menu with more categories and soups.  Pasta seems too heavy for a lunch that one must consider everyday go to place. Their ambience is a killer."}
{"text":"First noticed Vapianos in Europe and it was Love at first bite.  I enjoy thin crust pizza without a lot of sauce and this place definitely satisfied my need.  I was pleasantly surprised to see one in Charlotte. The Pasta is delicious and if you like to have people serve or wait on you,  skip this place but if you're looking for tasty pasta at a nice price with a good atmosphere definitely try it. Don't be intimidated by the self service system.  It's not rocket science. Take your card they give you when you come in to the station you prefer;  Pizza or Pasta and order. They have a small menu or you can create your own.  You scan your card as you place your order and take a buzzer which will go off when your food is done.  You pay on the way out by scanning the card again.  Done and full!"}
{"text":"The Ravioli Con Carne is excellent!!! I love evening about this place. Love the pay card that you receive at the door. Your meal is always made to order and so far I have not had a long wait to receive my order or to be seated. One of the best restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have been to Vapiano numerous times for dinner and enjoy the food tremendously.  It is fast food style - you order at the counter - with quality food.  99% of the time the cooks are exceptional with a bad apple once in a while. Hence four out of five stars. I highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"NOTE TO READERS:  I am now an employee of this location and have added some more detailed information that I will keep up-to-date  After dining at Vapianos a few times, I have settled with four stars.  If you are looking for an Italian style lunch/dinner casual/business casual lounge than look no further.      With an elegant yet modern full service bar and 5-10 minute food service, Vapianos is the perfect hangout spot for a quick bite or for a few hours of conversation.  Here you can find a decent selection of pasta combinations, as well as pizza, soup, salad, a bar, and dessert.  The food is excellent, but what really makes this place is the ambience.  The food is self-service or cafeteria style which is ideal when dining with a group of friends or family.  Each person receives a credit card that allows them to purchases drinks and food as they wish without the need for flagging down a server.  The average meal price ranges from 7.95-15.95, and the bar offers all that you would expect from a slightly upscale bar.    All pasta and dough used in the store is freshly made in the restaurant each day.  Some of the spices used in the dishes are also grown inside Vapiano.  You can find different herbs growing on each table in the restaurant.  This is one of the few places in charlotte you can find authentic Italian pizza and pasta and is going on my list of best places to dine in Charlotte.  Vapianos is a neat place that is worth a try and is practical on any budget.  They even have German gummy bears available to all guests at the host station!  Parking:  -Vapianos does not validate or offer valet -street parking is available for two hours/free on weekends or after six pm  -plenty of garages around the area (avrg. price: $5,00)"}
{"text":"Start with the bad - this place can be overwhelming if you don't know what to do. You walk in and are handed what feels and looks like a ski pass card with no explanation (which duh, if they had to explain it every single time that would be a pain and create traffic jams at the door). Maybe just a quick description of the process of dining here on the card would help?   However, I used to eat at Vapiano in Germany all the time so I knew what to do. My mom was totally clueless though and said that if I weren't there she would have just handed the card back and left since she felt so lost.   **Anyone reading this that's never been there: Go grab a menu from the main desk at the front, step off to the side, and decide what you want! Then just go to one of the lines for said desired dish, wait your turn, and then order! They make it right there in front of you. Shouldn't take more than 5ish minutes (and if you can't stand and wait that long, you're lazy). There are trays, silverware, and napkins right next to the counter, and salt/pepper, olive oil, and balsamic on the tables. Once you order, lay your card down on the little square (usually they'll prompt you), and the card gets loaded with your balance. Voila! Eat, leave your tray (they'll clean up after you), take your card up to that front desk, and pay. :)  I've never been disappointed with their food in Germany, and this location in Charlotte was just as great (even better - no language barrier!)"}
{"text":"Love the idea and the execution of it at Vapiano's.  The concept fits well especially when dining in a larger group where everyone is on there own agenda..which is pretty much always!  It is a classy/casual atmosphere, slightly upscale feel.   Great selection of nice-size personal pizza's and salad's.  I typically get the Insulata Mista and add chicken or steak on it and avocado, drives the price up a few bucks.  Worth it for a grown @ss man, makes for a healthy great meal.  Recently they shorted me big time on the amount of steak, however the cook made up for it.  She knew what she did.   Great place in Uptown for casual food, good variety."}
{"text":"This is a place we stumbled across while looking for some food before the ACC Championship game. Everything was packed and this place looked big enough that we could still get a seat with a lot of people. I don't think we could have randomly wandered into a better place for what we were looking for that night. Got some pizza and drinks before walking to the stadium. The second time we went it was slightly less impressive. Everything was good (including the live band) except my pizza wasn't Vapiano's best effort that night. That said, it's right in the middle of the action, good for groups and relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant one opportunity after another. Spacing my visits out at least by a month. I went there yesterday, everything was perfectly fine, things were going well. I ordered a salad, with only lettuce, tomato, cucumbers and told the person to add chicken to it. The person who took my order for my salad was very nice and polite, I had no problems. They were quick with my salad, however, when my pager buzzed, I looked at the salad they were making and realized it had way more than I asked for. All asked for was lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and add chicken. The salad had all of that + a million other things. They never just give me what I ask for and that is the 3rd or 4th time that has happened. I keep going back because I really like the balsamic dressing. However, yesterday was the last straw. Management should encourage better customer service because it is AWFUL.  While my salad was re-made immediately, when I ordered, I was very specific about what I wanted. It's frustrating for something to be wrong every time I go. Last time I went they ran out of balsamic dressing and gave me a dry salad, customer service was poor. The time before that, my salad was wrong. I have food allergies so I can only eat salads from there but I won't be back. I'm only giving two stars because I enjoy the balsamic dressing that much."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere contemporary Eco-chic, comfortable. Fun, and different."}
{"text":"While I'm not fond of the backless chairs, the good food and wine make up for it. This is a self serve restaurant where you watch as they cook. The chefs are so friendly and accommodating. The bar staff pour good drinks and PLEASE note you have to tip them separately at the end."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Go here about every time we go to the Hornets or Panthers games. I always get the pesto e spinaci and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Last night before Alive After Five me and a couple friends went to Vapiano's for the first time. The place has a really cool vibe and was decorated really nicely so I was pretty excited. However, my excitement waned after I waited in the pasta line for about 15 minutes. When it was finally my turn to order, I asked for the Salmon and Dill Pasta Special, the man cooking looked at me and said they were out of salmon and if i had a second choice...I hesitated because I was pretty set on that dish, after seeing my distress he told me he was just kidding, and proceeded to fix my pasta. While he was making it he asked me to swipe my card, which I did. About ten minutes later my pasta was finished and and asked if I had already swiped my card, and i told him I had.Then he tells me that he doesn't bleive me and keeps telling me to swipe. I thought he was joking because he had joked about the salmon earlier and of course i didn't want to get charged twice. I eventually found he was, in fact, not joking so I swiped my card again and it revealed I had already done it like I told him. I was not too fond of being called a liar...  Anyway, the pasta was great! my friends pizza was kind of burnt but that was still good. And their complimentary bread is nothing special.   If you want shorter wait times and a kinder staff I would definitely recommend going elsewhere, I will certainly not be returning."}
{"text":"I love the concept. Each station has a little of what you want. Your sangria needs a lot of work and modification. I'm Portuguese and I know what good sangria tastes like. Blah, not a fan of it. Martinis were pretty awesome and the pizza was spot on. The portion size of the pizza was out of this world."}
{"text":"We came back to try their food,where should I begin.  We walked to the pasta section and one of the cook was like \"someone would be right with you\" um okay,we were still looking at the menu and when we ready to order another cook said\" oh someone would've be right right you\" hmmm ok finally the cook show up and was like \" what you want\" he looks like he does not wanna be there nor cook our food at all,he had a bad attitude and seems rude,my partner ordered the pasta delicata,I was gonna order something but after seeing his attitude I decided not to order I don't want someone who does not wanna be there cook my food.  His pasta had too much sauce on the bottom it's almost like a noodle soup than a pasta dish,he had to ask for another bowl to drain the sauce. The pasta taste decent,not awesome but not awful. The beef was cooked perfectly tender.  The bartender however was the total opposite of the cook that prepare our food, he was attentive and friendly.  We would've never come back after the bad customer service at the kitchen but the bartender and the food save this place.  Hopefully next time we won't get that rude cook to prepare our food again.   Food- 3 Kitchen service- 0 Bar service- 4"}
{"text":"If I brought an Italian in here, they'd have a heart attack.  My pasta was so al dente, it crunched."}
{"text":"This place was a totally different experience than what I'm used too. It was actually pretty cool. When you first enter, you're given a card. This is the card that holds your check info. You then look through the menu and go to the corresponding station to order your meal. You swipe your card at the station, you're given a pager and then you have a seat wherever you'd like. You pick up your own utensils and drinks . The drink station is at the back next to the restrooms and the utensils are near the food stations. When your order is ready, your pager goes off and you go get your food at the station you ordered from. When you're done with your meal, you go to the front (where you got your card) and they swipe it to get the total price of your meal. It's cool because sometimes waiters aren't very attentive and this takes that element right out. Sadly, I couldn't give it 5 stars because, the restaurant was kind of messy with food on a lot of the tables and on the floor. Also, my food was REALLY spicy with jalapeños when my meal didn't even have it listed on the menu ?. Either way, I liked the whole concept of the restaurant and would probably come back again."}
{"text":"Let me begin with this is my 2nd post ever.. I am from California and we are visiting family in Charlotte. My niece LOVES this place.. My 1st visit here was back in 2016 in June. When she graduated.. Tonight we were all back again. It started out out fantastic with the pizza and salad stations and to the men who took care of us. Then I went to the pasta station and things went terribly wrong.. I never like to focus on the bad, as who know what was happening with this man and his life.. He could be having personal issues as he checked his phone a few times as I was waiting.. I have no idea... But this is not what this review is about. It's about the Employees who went Above and Beyond to make me and my family feel Welcomed. 1. The man who came up to me that was cleaning his station. His goal to fix the hiccup that had happened at the pasta station. 2. The Chef who came to our table. He went above and beyond again Listening and making us feel important. 3. The bartender who I have no idea if she knew if she knew what had transpired. However, she was warm and engaging. And 4. To the manager who was supportive and made us feel welcomed. These 4 individuals were Amazing and Exemplify what True Customer Service is about. If you are looking for  individuals who truly care about guest service this is your place!! Thank you all for all you did for me and my family, we truly appreciate it!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great concept, get a card, go to a station to order your freshly prepared meal, drink, or dessert how you like it and swipe away! Every station has a swiping device for your card to capture your order so don't lose it. The bar area is very plush and sassy.......me like! I'm a little confused on whether you actually have a waiter/waitress since everything is basically do it yourself and you take your card to the counter to swipe and pay before leaving. I tried the bolognese on this visit and although it was not as fab as Vivace's version, it was pretty good. The pasta is made on-site but it didn't taste fresh to me....I'm just saying. It was good but I think it was just way too many noodles and not enough sauce and I was only able to eat half and took the other half with me and they have neat tupperware like 'to go' containers that are microwavable.....nice! I'll have to try pizza and dessert on my next visit."}
{"text":"Was an alright first experience, grabbed a pizza after the knights fireworks. No wait, food was ready fairly quickly. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Okay so this review is on my experience at the \"lounge\" after hours. I went with some friends who wanted to hang out (there was also a social experiment involved) when this joint turns into a nightclub... OH WAIT! It's a lounge. What is a lounge? Does it involve me screaming at the top of my lungs because the music is so loud when talking to someone? Does is it involve dancing to hip and r&b music on a dance floor? Does it involve a DJ playing music that makes you want to shake your ass on the dance floor?   Now I'm not hating on the experience and I'm not knocking what people refer to this place after 11 PM. But ummmmm... I thought a lounge involved yes music, but not so loud that I'm screaming at the top of my lungs to have a conversation.   Oddly enough there are a good number of people (I asked) who refer to this as a lounge. A lot of people are hanging back watching people walk around, eat, dance, whatever. It's odd. Maybe I'm just out of touch with this scene.   When you go in they give you this card that you use to order food. If you lose it, you have to pay $50. At the end of the night or whenever you leave, you give the card back and pay for whatever you purchased. I like the concept, but that would totally suck if someone steals another person's card. Basically, guard that card with your life.   My friend's pizza was good (bail, mozzarella, sauce). Nothing to brag about. Maybe I'll go back just for some food... when I can actually carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Good food, good crowd, good music, and weak beverage. My lemon drop tasted like pure sugar water."}
{"text":"I will say this one of my fav places to go when craving pasta and last min. I have a thing for made to order restaurants so this was right up my alley. Technically I ordered the shrimp pesto with fettuccini but substituted the shrimp for smoked salmon. I think next time I will do regular salmon instead of smoked though the taste was a little strong for me and stayed on my breath for a long time(kind of annoying even with gum). The food is very flavorful though and I can never finish it in one sitting. As far as I know every pasta dish comes with complimentary bread, olive oil, and a balsamic vinegar if I'm not mistaken. You do have to account for the fact that there is no server for each table unless maybe if you're at the bar, so to me that kind of took away from the customer service aspect but not a huge deal. The bar area is very nice as well and always serves great drinks; I'm a sucker for their sangrias. I can't wait til it warms up so I can make use of the outside area. This is a place I would recommend if you have any visitors come to town for a visit, the ambiance is perfect"}
{"text":"Man oh man...the food was amazing, the ambiance was amazing, and the cost was not at all expensive! This is a most DEFINITE place to eat if you are traveling here! U won't regret it;) ur welcome!"}
{"text":"Visited here during a convention in Charlotte by recommendation from the hubby and man--this was some good grub! We went with a party of 10 and they were more than accommodating. I wish we had such a concept here in PHX!  So many choices and options even for the most picky of palates. The food was cooked to order--which I love. The salads were fresh and tasty.  But like my hubby--I wish there was beverage service because it is a bit awkward to have to leave the table when dining with associates to refill a drink. This isn't McDonalds....  I do look forward to coming back during my next trip to Charlotte though!"}
{"text":"Very excited about this place! Love the vibe, atmosphere, prices and especially the food!!! Amazing! & I love not having a server, no one to bug you;) great drink prices too! You can be casual or dress up for a night out! This place is great!"}
{"text":"(2.5/3) For first timers, this 'restaurant' is organized a lot like a high-tech, italian-only food court. Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time.   I ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great.\" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go.   Finally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast service, awesome ambience and even better food! An awesome chain! Would eat here every time! Especially next to the olive tree inside"}
{"text":"Checked this place out after going to Alegria the other night. From the street, it draws you in with it's fun outdoor patio (reminded me of NYC) and it's bright lights and red decor. When we entered we were given a warm greeting and then instructions on how this restaurant operates.   The hostess/cashier said it was created after a \"German\" model. That was the first thing that struck me odd...if it's created after something German, why are they serving Italian? I'm sure Italian is more popular, but I could see it working with brats and beers just the same.   We walked around with the \"debit\" cards, but found it feeling too cafeteria style for us. Plus, if the chefs/servers are waiting for us to order, there weren't any around when we were checking out desserts to sell us on one. Plus, if it's Italian, the desserts should be overwhelming and beautiful. Instead, they looked like basic pudding you'd find at a Furr's. We also curious about the menu...where was it? I got overwhelmed with the writing above each station, that perhaps that was it and I missed it?   We left feeling like it had potential, but wasn't too customer service oriented. I see how others had the same feeling of a dorm cafeteria or something...that is the impression that has stuck with us. I'll give them stars for the decor, location, and olive tree in the middle, but not sure that we'll go back to try the food though since the prices are high and they make you work for it."}
{"text":"Large portions, food had taste.  I had a salad w/feta that was more then white & adding color to the greens & kalamata olives that had that brineness that you expect vs. again just being pellets that add something to liven a pile of greens.    The rest of the group had pastas.  This cafeteria style has the ambience of what it is - a large cafeteria.  It is noisy so expect to shout to be heard.  It can accomodate large parties w/o an issue. Pricing is a little bit more then a Just Fresh.  1 restroom all the way in the back getting around a myriad of people at lunch. 1 beverage station in the back so if you are sitting towards the front can feel like a hike.  Can be confusing if it is your 1st time & you don't have a guide as to how it works.  They will give you a card when you 1st enter.  Take the card to the station you'd like to order from. Swipe on the pad in front of the station after you order.  It is now on that card.  Just need to take the card when you go to the cashier & they will swipe it for the total."}
{"text":"When I first walked into Vapiano, I was so confused.  It looks like an upscale restaurant but there aren't any waiters. There were hostesses but they don't seat you. You get a little card instead of a menu.  You wait in line to order your food and find your own seat, but the atmosphere definitely doesn't look like a food court.   Once you figure it out, it's not too bad.  Grab a menu and go wait in the line you're interested in. Order your food and put your card on the little scanner, and boom. You're on your way to a delicious lunch.  The pasta line seemed to be the longest.  The basil pesto with campanelle was tasty but a tad oily. The bread helped get rid of that greasy feeling though. The pasta itself was cooked to perfection, as my campanelle was chewy and soft.  Water cups are at the bar!   Vapiano seems to reserve tables too so if you're thinking of stopping by with a large group during the lunch rush, try to call ahead of time."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! We went here for dinner and shared the margherita pizza and ricotta and spinach ravioli. Both were delicious and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality given how fast the food was ready. The restaurant also had a really cool atmosphere and ordering process. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Short Story: Good amount of menu items and decent price point but overall the food I've tried has severely lacked flavor.  Food - (2/5) The pasta dishes are pretty bland. I've tried a couple of times and I would suggest going for a flatbread pizza instead.  Service - (4/5) The one time I did physically visit Vapiano, the chefs were nice and accommodating.   Location - (4/5) It's convenient if you live or work Uptown. Parking can be a hassle if you're coming from else where though.  Venue - (4/5) Its a nice spot that's decorated pretty well. It's clean and inviting, I just wish the food was better.    Value - (3/5) It misses the mark where it counts the most. It's not expensive but who wants to pay for bland food."}
{"text":"3.75 Star Review (I'm an Engineer.....what can I say, I like precision!)  :-)  Back for another run at Vapiano's, and another solid effort. The trick is to go early before the Banking crowd overruns the place.....so 1130 is ideal.   I had the Americana Pizza, with marinara, fresh mozzerella, pepperoni and italian sausage, and I had them add onions and mushrooms. Neopolitan style, not \"NY\" style (with that cruddy foldable crust - EW) so it was nice and crispy on the edges and soff (mayble a little too soft) in the middle. Overall a nice lunch pizza. Decent size too.  My buddy had their pasta carbonarra. THAT was delicious.....I deliberately did NOT order that because I wanted to avoid this (mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm) on my computer when my chin hit the keyboard!   No \"service\" to speak of, except the folks who clean up.   A solid lunch place for sure."}
{"text":"I would definitely stay away from anything with seafood as I got food poisoning from their salmon pasta dish.. It doesn't seem like they're using fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"I'm from Europe and where I'm from Vapiano's is pretty much a staple. I think there's only 3 or so in the US so I was happy to visit Charlotte so I could come here!! We flew in pretty late and got there right before close. They were already cleaning up but they put everything back out to make our food. It was as good as back home!! Some of the menu items are a bit different but if you want quick, simple, affordable Italian-like food then this is your spot!! If you and your friends are up for a challenge charge all the items on 1 card and have everyone pull a card. One lucky loser pays all!"}
{"text":"Okay, so for ambience-  I gave this place stars.  BUT,  if this were just based on the food-  I would give no starts.  My husband is Italian and his father owned to traditional Italian restaurants in our home town.  That being said,  we still appreciate the modern twist to Italian too; however, this was neither.  They make their own pasta-  but it's is sticky, tastless and chewy.  It was aweful.  My husband and I both got pasta dishes and on both-  they cook forgot things that were supposed to be cooked into the pasta.  My huband got a spinach pasta,  the guy forgot to cook it in-  so his thought-  put the pasta from the plate back in the skillet,  add in the spinach and mix it around a couple of times.  Needless to say,  it was like cold raw spinach leaves with your hot pasta-- didn't really go.  The other thing-  no one is coming around and refilling drinks or taking your plates or bringing you your food-  so why would you have that massive clear box for tip money (right where the hostess is) when you go up to pay.  It just seemed tacky.   You can't have it both ways-  either you are like a deli where you order at the counter and get your food- or have someone come around and at least refill your drinks, bus your tables (which was not done) and making sure everything is okay.   I think this place has potential - but it just totally misses the mark.  The other thing-  if you want a drink-  you've go to go to the bar to order it,  then you have to go to this line for this,  then this line for that-  just doesnt make that much sense to me."}
{"text":"Picture this: Italian day at the college cafeteria of your choice. There you have Vapiano. Surprisingly, fresh pastas made to order are pretty dang yummy if not too inventive. I enjoyed the house-made sangria for $5.50 on a recent Saturday night. Other bar drinks were underwhelming. We had to request water from the bar- as there is no table service. This place is gorgeous - shared tables - so be aware. You can grab fresh herbs from the \"garden\" to add to your meal. I enjoyed the spicy shrimp, fennel and orange salad. Prices are fare and if I am in the area I would certainly stop by for a quick, fresh lunch. Not to mention: gummy bears by the check-out!"}
{"text":"Love the concept and the pesto pasta mix is the best! Been there a few times, and my recent visit a few weeks ago was good as always."}
{"text":"Like the restaurant concept. Food was good. Had the carbonara and added shrimp for addl flavor and texture. Good flavor on the carbonara but just a tad bit salty (Maybe just right for some). Sat at the bar and Bartender was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Very different... Pasta. Pizza. Bar.  We walked in and were very kindly greeted.  Then we were handed a menu and a card.  Ummm... okay.  The hostess then explained that you go to a personal chef station and he will put your order on the card, which you then bring back when you are done to check out.  Interesting...  The space is huge.  Wide open and very airy with apparently 100 year old olive trees and herb plants in terra cotta pots scattered about.  The furniture is very mod yet natural feeling for the space as well.  There are several lines form at the long kitchen and they are designated with their specialty (pizza, antipasta, salad, pasta) above on the chalkboard mural.  To quote Tom Petty, \"the waiting is the hardest part.\"  If you find yourself behind someone in the pasta line, as I did, you can expect to stand there for at least fifteen minutes.  But in the waiting, you realize that this isn't just someone with a vat of noodles and a big pot of sauce.  You can see into a back room just passed the kitchen that they make all their pasta in house, which they put into serving size containers that they personal chef then cooks.  And you have your choice of pasta.  I chose my sauce, sausage e verdure, to add to penne.  My friend has scampi e spinach with tagliatelle.  I thought it was neat that the pasta was put into an almost timed deep frier (only with boiling water) set up to cook.  We were able to stand and converse as our food cooked, occassionally answering ingredient questions.  A little garlic, throw in some spice, et cetera.  Our personal chefs were personable and quite capable.  This was gourmet pasta at its best.  The vegetables and sausage were delicious and the pasta was perfect.  Jen is a what I would consider a foodie, and we were both thoroughly impressed.  They also give you some delicious bread with oils on each of the tables.  Getting drinks wasn't inherently clear as far as the process.  But they have a full bar at the front which looks well appointed and is surrounded by inviting lounge seating between the bar and kitchen.  I will definitely be back when I have more time.  This would be an awesome spot for dinner before an uptown show or drinks after."}
{"text":"Good pasta! Portion is great for the price. Easy to get in and out. Take out is really fast."}
{"text":"Don't do takeout here. They say 15-20 min, and came here 30 min later, and the food still wasn't even made yet. Either they forgot or they need to tell a longer wait time knowing it's lunch time and it will most likely take longer."}
{"text":"This is one of the neatest places in CLT. I love watching fresh ingredients being added to my customized meal right before my eyes. Fun vibe, great place just to grab a drink too. Neat way to pay and get out the door quick."}
{"text":"Vapiano is a fun way to get dinner! Like the casual vibe and style of service. The Crema Di Funghi with Chicken is my favorite dish. My friend ordered the Shrimp salad and really enjoyed it. I would recommend Vapiano to a friend."}
{"text":"How very trendy this place is. So basically you walk in and they give you a card to just scan at any station you're ordering from and then you get a pager and wait to be buzzed whenever it's ready. It's a neat if confusing concept.  The problem I have with this place is that it's almost impossible to get the attention of one of the cooks making whatever you want to order. Really my friends and I were the only ones in line standing around for a good 3-4 minutes waiting to order a pizza. Which brings me to another point, the pizza here is nothing special to write home about. I jazzed it up with some of the herbs in the pots which I thought was a great idea(that's what they're there for right?), and a healthy dose of olive oil to liven it up. If I was paying regular prices for the pizza I would have said no sir, especially since you are pretty much doing everything but the cooking yourself! But seeing as they have a $5 special on pizza almost every day, I think it's just fine to pop in for a carb loaded snack before you set off to do something else in uptown.  Cheap, quick, not easy to get rung up. Will come again for cheap pizza to pig out on."}
{"text":"You can read the other reviews to understand how the service works (or doesn't work as the case may be..) Let me just give you my highlights:   Stood in line for 55 min for a bowl of pasta - you only get a beeper if your ordering pizza - the pasta was very good. But not worth standing in line for 55 min.   Went to the bar for a glass of wine - bartender's opening words were NOT \"hi, what can I get you..\" instead: \"When you tip your bartendar, please put the money on the bar and not in the cannister. Tips in the cannister have to be shared with all the employees..\"  Seriously. Really.  I then got served a warm glass of mediocre wine. Needless to say, no tipping took place.  Then had to wait in-line to pay the bill for this miserable experience.  Not a manager in sight. No one cared.  Me neither - won't go back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service! Food is not worth the money. I wouldn't recommend it. I ordered food via Grubhub and my driver had to wait an extremely long time for my food. I was told that others who came in and ordered food after he arrive were seen leaving with their food before mine was ready. They also have poor customer service that's why I ordered it via Grubhub to begin with."}
{"text":"This place has one problem the staff and the management , the pizza guy knows the pizza was not okay but he don't care , he's busy talking with his friend thank you ."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe. Had cheese pizza, risotto with spinach, chilis, and sweet potato, and amazing sangria. We went during the day, and the vibe was very laid back and comfortable for all (my husband and I went with our 2 and 6 yr old, and met up with other family members, adults and kids, and we all had a blast). Walked by later that night and clearly this is the place to be. Will be returning as soon as I come back to town."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and they make it all right in front of you. You can customize your pasta or pizza the way you like it. The bar has a good selection of beer and wine. The best part about this place is the way you pay. They give you a card when you walk in and you swipe for everything you want so there's no confusion on what you buy especially if you have a larger party. I would definitely recommend this play if you want Italian food."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere.   The place features different stations where you order and add it to your card/tab, sit at High top tables and then they will clear your plates for you.   Gluten-free risotto is delicious and filling and comes with 2 pieces of bread-- so that's not gluten free.   They have a few mini desserts in a case at the bar to choose from as well, and free gummy bears by check out.   The staff preparing your food are not the friendliest, and the noise can be moderate, especially when there are big groups since it's one big dining area, but overall my experiences have been positive!"}
{"text":"First time last Saturday night. Great Pizza. $12 for chicken pesto pizza was enough for two. Very reasonable. Beer on tap from Triple C's for $5 - what could be better? The atmosphere was perfect for a large group."}
{"text":"Vapiano's is designed and laid out like a stylish European quick service restaurant. As you walk in you are handed a plastic charge card the size of a credit card. When you order the food, the price is added to the card and you pay for everything as you leave.  Since everything is self service, tipping is not required, however, leaving a couple of dollars for the person cleaning tables never hurts.  The food selection ranges from a wide variety of pasta (made fresh in house) with different meat, vegetable and sauce options to pizza, sandwiches and salads. All of the dishes are priced reasonably and the portion sizes are generous.   The overall atmosphere is casual with decor that would not be out of place in a much more upscale restaurant.   There are two reasons why Vapiano's did not receive a 5 star rating from me:  The amount of meat, seafood, etc. that comes with most of the dishes tends to be on the small to miniscule side.  The other proplem is the consistency of the food. Depending on the cook that prepares your order, your food may be over or under seasoned.  The other night we ordered the Pesto E Spinaci and the \"hint\" of basil pesto ended up being a big heaping boat load of pesto.  Overall the is a very good place to go if you are looking for good food at a fair price. As long as you don't mind getting your own food and drink refills you should be able to enjoy Vapiano's."}
{"text":"First time trying this place with some coworkers.  The concept of the restaurant is a little confusing at first because they don't really explain how it all works when you walk in (and there were no signs either).  Upon entering, you're basically given a Vapiano \"credit card\" and you place it on a little space when you order, and that's how they charge you at the end for your food.  You just walk up to the different stations offering Italian dishes ranging from pasta to pizza to antipasta to calzones, etc. Think Chipotle or Subway, because you can watch the line cooks make your order fresh. It's served cafeteria-style and you take your tray to first come, first serve seating.  There's also a bar area and cute little red couch seating areas, as well.  You get a good amount of food for what you pay.  I didn't even finish my lunch portion and took it home. Other than giving no instructions, the staff is friendly and attentive.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Great Surprise!  Found this place by accident last night.  I've read the reviews though never thought I would eat here.  We were walking by and I snapped a photo when one of the employees came outside and starting talking to us and almost pulled us in - BOLD move!  Already being very skeptical (very picky about food and VERY, VERY when it comes to Italian or Pizza and Pizza)... Though as I've heard it said and agree, \"Fortune Favors the Bold\" - I admire those who will take a chance and be a little pushy or at least assertive to see if they can influence a \"Hard Sell\" like me!  So the guy shows us around and tells us how it works.  We had already been to Ri Ra, though decided to look around and were probably going back to Ri Ra, just wanted to explore more first. The big part of the pitch was \"fresh, fresh, fresh\", prices were right and we stayed - We had a Salami Pizza and bread.  The food and cook service was very good.  Yes we will go back!  The food and price were big pluses for us, though I'm not sure of the overall concept, especially the card swiping card part, it was no problem for us (two on one card and my friend payed for everything - Thanks if you are reading this) I'm not sure how others will accept the concept and self serve part.  The last song was Annie Lennox (Eurythmics) \"Sweet Dreams\" though \"Who's that Girl\" would have been more suited to the situation!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  My teenage daughter thought it was AMAZING - she called it an Italian Hitbatchi :)"}
{"text":"This place is unsettling. The decor is incredibly Asian-bistro, but the food is Italian. Also, the space is so incredibly huge, it feels like some sort of high school cafe mixed with a dance club....it's so strange! The whole \"walk up to counter and order for yourself\" thing wasn't too bad, but for an Italian restaurant, I tend to think comfortable, noisy, boisterous, homey, warm, inviting....Vapiano is none of those things. But anyway, onto what really matters, the food. I went with the Toscana pizza. It was perfectly meh. Hailing from Chicago, I guess I'm spoiled with pizza that makes my brain want to explode with every bite. Vapiano's pizza was pretty okay. As a pizza connoisseur, pretty okay doesn't really cut it for me....so Vapiano's really didn't cut it for me. I suppose it's worth a try though, just because it's so different."}
{"text":"Decent food, i am here some days for lunch break. Usually the line moves pretty fast."}
{"text":"The people who take the order and cook the food had bad attitudes and were hard to understand because they don't speak clearly or loudly enough. None of the food I ordered was good. The dessert I had to go was also terrible and there were strands of hair inside the container. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Vapiano is not necessarily the worlds best pasta, but it's still a regular stop for me. I like that I can get a fresh made dish with exactly what I want. There is usually a little wait for at lunch time as you stand & wait while they make it & each cook handles 2 or so at a time. The process of picking up a card for your orders & juggling at takeout container at the cashier where there isn't a counter is awkward, but food still reliably decent."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Sunday and the service was great. There was no wait (other than our food cooking) and we got to pick it up very quickly.   Both my boyfriend and I finished our plates and we're full, yet not too full. So the portions for each dish are really well thought out.   The pasta is made in house and was absolutely delicious. It made me want to learn how to make my own pasta someday so I can eat that quality in my own home.   Overall, 10/10 experience and I can't want to come back and eat more food!"}
{"text":"Vapiano brings excitement and an overall new dining experience to the uptown Charlotte area.  I am constantly amazed at the sophistication that this restaurant has through its modern twist on both food and culture.  Two words that describe my experience?  Fresh and delicious.  Any and every meal at this place is quite tasty.  And with prices that aren't sky-rocketing high, Vapiano gives you more bang for your buck.  Great place to kick back with friends or even for a quick lunch with co-workers during the week.  From salads to pizza to pasta, Vapiano has everything to cure your Italian food cravings!  Never a disappointment - try it out!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner after the nutcracker performance. The place was not busy at all and yet we found ourselves standing around waiting for the chefs to take orders. Food looked appetizing but fell flat. We were all starving and yet we didn't finish anything. Very acidic red sauce and just not tasty at all. Took home all the left overs. Then tossed in the trash this morning after all 3 of us complained of feeling sick all night long. Never going back!!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here..  The Alfredo is really good. The sauce is really thick. I would almost say it's too cheesy if there was such a thing, but I'd much prefer that over a typical, watery sauce.  I wasn't too impressed with the Primavera.. The  broccoli was cooked perfectly, and the tomatoes were fresh, but the bell peppers were overpowering and kinda soggy  We ended up picking out the bell peppers, mixing the two dishes together, and splitting it up."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place was really neat. I liked the setup - you receive a card, order at the stations, they swipe your card, and they check you out on your way out the door. I like to eat dessert and my entree at the same time, so this setup was awesome for me. I got to have a sweet alongside my meal, which is how I prefer it! It was half priced wine bottles on Sunday night, so we had a bottle to share. My boyfriend got a calzone. I got linguine alfredo with mushrooms and peas. The food is what you would expect, good, but not authentic Italian. Fine by me, it was still yummy.  The service here wasn't great, the bartender and the hostess were the only staff that were friendly. I had never been here so when I approached the pasta station, there were three people behind the counter, I came up and greeted one of the guys with a \"Hello! How are you?\" He looked at me with a confused look on his face and exclaimed \"HUH?!\" It was a really weird interaction, he then sent me to a different guy at the station. Not sure how you're supposed to know what person to \"order\" from when there are several working behind the station? The second guy wasn't very nice either, not sure if it's just because he could barely hear me though. For someone who had never been here and was trying to learn how the system worked, the staff wasn't very helpful in that regard.  We will be returning here because the food was good and because my boyfriend loved eating it in Germany (it's a German franchise!). Also - they had the good balsamic! Next time I do hope the service is better."}
{"text":"Food was good. Concept was a little different but I enjoyed it. The reason for the three stars is due to the service from the chefs. This is the face of the business as there are no waiters. Really disappointed in their performance. No enthusiasm and could care less about my parties dining experience. It was actually a talking point for most members of my party after leaving."}
{"text":"When I looked this restaurant up on yelp, I was surprised that they only had 3 stars. I hope I can give people a different perspective on this restaurant.  Upon entry, you are given a card and this card is basically your bill. I thought it was pretty neat, being able to self serve and getting whatever you want while charging this card (I found it very dangerous as you can easily rack your bill, just like a credit card, without knowing how much was ordered). At first, I was a little confused because I didn't really know how it worked, but I went to the bar got a drink and gave them the card.  Inside, it was very decorative and lots of places to sit. I took a picture of one of the neat tables with the tree in the middle. It gave a feeling of zen within the restaurant. The surrounding tables are a little small, but its nothing to worry about because there are big tables as well. I can see how it could be busy during the day, but I went on a Friday night and there wasn't that many people.   I ordered the Pasta Cognac which I believe was a special that night. It was pretty tasty, but I wished the portion was a little bit bigger. I believe that was my fault because I got the Linguini instead of the other style of pasta, and there were cheaper options with more food. They have a wok and they cook it right in front of you. They also give you free bread, so make sure to get some. Swipe your card and you're off to eat!  I didn't get to try the pizza, however I did drink. Nice 3 long islands as well as a couple of shots for the birthday girl. And, major props to the bartender as he made my long islands pretty strong and tasty. They tend to put a lot of ice in them, so for the second and third one I told them not to put so much ice and a little more of the sour mix and coke.  On an off topic, in the bathroom there are some awesome hand drying machines. And they have a schedule of the artists that come in every Thursday and Friday night that play live music. If you come, come on one of those nights to enjoy nice music to go along with your food and drink."}
{"text":"Vapiano has an attractive and open seating layout which sparked my interest and led me to try heavier Italian food instead of lighter alternatives for lunch. The menu offers the favorites including pastas, pizzas, salads, and soups. The food is prepared in plane view in-front of you which allows for the option to exclude any ingredients should you prefer it.  There is no Wow factor which would differentiate Vapiano's menu from other Italian eateries. I would describe the taste, creativity, and quality of food as generic. The portions are large but serve little benefit since the lacking taste leaves little appetite to finish it all.  You are provided a card which records your order history. The transaction is completed when you deposit the card to the cashier along with a payment type. I find the process to be unnecessarily cumbersome. Overall Vapiano's is one convenient option in Uptown Charlotte however the quality of food and the complexity of completing a transaction earns Vapiano's at most a third or fourth back up option."}
{"text":"This is a cool hip place in the uptown area. You walk in get a card and anytime you order something you just scan the card. They have pizza, pasta, salads and soup for about $9-$13. The chicken alfredo and the ricotta spinaci are so far my favorite. I had the cream di funghi which was a bit disappointing.  As for dessert, you can't go wrong with the creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"Been to several locations worldwide and would say that this is not the best by any means. Nonetheless you can expect above average quality meals here. Would recommend for a lunch with some friends from the office or as a place to stop for a quick meal after work. It's causal and convenient, but if you are going for a high quality meal, I would recommend elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a cold Tuesday afternoon.  The restaurant is located in the heart of uptown Charlotte, so good luck finding reliable street parking -- you might have to save about $10 for parking in the (almost full) lots on some adjacent streets, especially during the lunch rush.  I stood awkwardly outside the restaurant for 15 minutes waiting for my friends to park, and noticed that Vapiano was the ONLY establishment on the entire block to have any foot traffic at all.  Everybody who passed by me either came from the restaurant or were going into it.  It was hyping me up for some delicious, hot Italian food.  And believe me, I was ready.  I didn't realize how big the restaurant was until I walked in.  It's like a classy cafeteria, and you have a ton of chefs in one line ready to make whatever kind of pasta/pizza/other Italian food you want.  You wait for your food up front, put it on a tray, and seat yourself.  Regular water and citrus-infused water is at a station at the bar.  To be honest, I'm not really too big on the Italian food.  But the food was pretty good and flavorful and came out decently quick.  I even wish I had more of it for the price I paid, but it's not unreasonable by any means.  I would definitely go back if I was in the area more often."}
{"text":"Took way to long to fix a salad and the employees had no urgency. I waited 30 minutes for a salad and when I order there was only 2 people ahead of me. I was about to cancel order due to the time. The ladies that was making the salads were talking more than trying to get the orders right. I notice a couple of customers brought there salad back due to a mistake that was made. How can you mess up a salad?!"}
{"text":"Vapiano is a spacious interesting commune style restaurant with a not so interesting menu.  The food wasn't bad at all.  It was actually ok but just a little boring.  I had a salad with shrimp and some  sweet chili type dressing that just was a weird combination of things.  Kind of like a salad you would make at home when you need to go food shopping and don't have a lot things that match.  It wasn't terrible.  More like odd and confusing!  The flatbread(I'm not going to call it pizza... As a New Yorker I just can not) is tasty and made fresh but I'm not that big on flatbreads so again I wasn't impressed.  Three stars because the food is not bad, it's just not my thing, and I love the citrus water but I don't love the cafeteria style of having to get up and get my good and refill my water unless I'm at a fast food place.  It just wasn't my jam."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. I have zero problem with the food itself - in fact I crave the stuff. The issue is with staff. Both times I have had a dining partner and we have paid together as a couple. First visit we used two cards for our food and my partner was harassed on the way out for \"not paying\" so I had to show my receipt to remind them that I had paid for her meal. Trying to avoid humiliating my dining partner the next time I went, I politely declined the second card when I arrived and was chastised loudly with, \"EVERYONE HAS to have an individual card\". So as we leave... Guess what? \"Ma'am. You have to pay\". I'm done here. The chefs are slow, hard to understand (you're speaking over a counter in a crowded restaurant...stop murmuring), the service clearing tables is slow on busy nights, it's impossible to get help from wait staff to clear tables, and the hostess has accused me of theft for the last time."}
{"text":"Hated it. I can see why some people liked it, but from the moment I walked in I was ready to leave.  1) When I walked in I approached the hostess to ask about the party I was meeting. I didn't even get a chance to speak. She Shoved the card and menu in my face, said some things, and then moved on to the next person.   2) The card system- I don't like having to get up to go get my food. But even beyond that, I hand my card to the person behind the counter who swipes it then goes back to cooking. With all my germs and who knows what else from the floor and other people on his hands. Made me not want to eat.  3) The food- I didn't like my food at all.  I had the verdure pizza, and it just wasn't good. There was very little cheese on it and there were too many large, heavy vegetables for the thin flimsy pizza slices.  4) Layout- They had my party in the front of the restaurant, which meant we had to walk to the back for our food, and keep going to the far corner of the restaurant for our drinks. Inconvenient. They also had us at a table with stools, which was extremely inconvenient because the stools were so tall and many of us were so short.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really great food and really horrible customer service. From the host to the chefs they were all very unfriendly and got annoyed by simple questions. Should hire new people."}
{"text":"This place is cool as hell. The decor is so beautifully done I was so impressed. You get a card when you walk in to put all your drinks and food on.   You walk up to the counter and can watch them prep your meal. Everything is so fresh and so Italian.   The bar and seating is so amazing. The food is so authentic. I will be back."}
{"text":"Upscale Italian food in a fast, casual setting. Awesome concept. Went here on a work trip and when my boss described the place as an Italian cafeteria it pretty much summed it up.   When you walk into the restaurant they hand you a card. There are a handful of different stations set up (pizza, pasta, salads, etc.) and you order from the specific station. You then swipe your card, and whatever you ordered gets added to the card. Then when you check out they swipe that card and charge you accordingly.   We went here twice and I tried both the fettucini carbonara and the caesar salad. The pasta was really fresh and had just the right amount of sauce. However the lettuce in my salad had already turned slightly brown and you could tell they dressed the salad hours ago instead of tossing it fresh. Small changes like this can go a long way.   The place is huge and has a ton of seating so a great spot for large groups. They can get really busy but the staff seems to work really hard to churn the orders out as quick as possible. Overall we were really impressed with Vapiano and would return."}
{"text":"Meh. At least for the salad w grilled shrimp. It has a furr's cafeteria but all grown up feel. You have to schlepp over to which ever station has what you want and yell your order at a minimum wage employee who is clearly not a chef and then schlepp over to the bar and explain to the bartender what  Sauvignon blanc is. They are very nice but food is kind of \"subway without the pedo spokesperson.\"  The salad is iceberg lettuce and the dressings are full of sugar.  Maybe the pizza is better."}
{"text":"I enjoy Vapiano. It's a nice place to eat Italian food with a cool vibe. When you come in you're given a card that you use for when you go to order at whichever food station you choose. Then you pay for everything that's on the card when you leave. Good concept. I usually get the bruschetta pizza. It's a thin crust, freshly made pizza with cheeses, marinated tomatoes, olive oil and arugula. So good. I recommend it. The chicken pesto pizza is good too. Try this place. If you like cool, hip places to eat, that are open and accommodating, you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for the weekend recently and happened to walk by this place around lunch time. We checked Yelp and saw that it had good reviews and decided to give it a try. We told the staff that it was our first time visiting the restaurant and they were all very helpful and explained how everything worked (order at the counter, swipe your restaurant card, pay when you leave).   After checking out all the food options, I decided to order a pizza and watched as the staff hand-tossed the dough and made the pizza in front of me. The pizza came out hot, fresh and well cooked. It was just the right amount for one person and tasted very good. My wife ordered a chicken pesto sandwiched and also liked it very much.   Our lunch was served in 10 minutes or less and the beverage station was self serve. I'm glad we decided to stop in.  If you are looking for a quick, fresh lunch, you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the way you order is different.  The pizza was good but I had some type of pasta dish that was excellent.  Can't wait to visit Charlotte again and try this place."}
{"text":"After a Segway tour uptown, we needed a place to grab a late lunch. After passing through Dean and Deluca, we saw Vapiano and decided to give it a shot.   We were greeted upon entering by the host with a smile. He explained how the \"card\" system works. You take your Vapiano \"credit card\" to each station and use that every time you order something. On the way out, you pay it all at once. The interior of the restaurant is modern, with light colored wood, plants on each table, and a huge chalkboard with sayings.  I got a chicken pesto panini, and must admit, a was surprised at how delicious it was. Sliced chicken, just the right amount of pesto, and a fantastic bread. It came with a side salad, which was very good as well. Perfectly dressed and yummy huge croutons.  After we were done, an employee approached us, asked if we needed boxes, how our meal was, and if we needed anything else. Thumbs up. While waiting to pay, they have a jar of gummy bears, never seen that before, but what a great idea.   Overall, Vapiano was a huge winner in my books. Friendly staff and delicious, quick food. I'll definitely be back. Kudos Vapiano!"}
{"text":"Have gone there several more times; mostly with kids.  A great family place - all can get what they want and kids can be kids without bothering others.  Pasta is fresh - pies hand tossed - and large fresh sharable salads.  Its a regular for us!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't understand at 1st, but they give you a credit card tyke thing where you charge your food on it then pay on the way out. We had pizza and pasta and salad. Was normal but ambiance made it really cool!! We will be back for sure. Reminded me of NYC spots."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the way of ordering is incredibly annoying... you end up waiting in lines and no one acknowledges you or gives you any indication of when you will be able to order... different people in your group get their food at all different times. I ended up eating my panini alone and then watching my boyfriend eat his pasta after... no one is nice or gives you any direction of how to get your food, where forks are, or anything."}
{"text":"Their pasta is amazing and taste very fresh, the staff was a little rude but that doesn't change the fact that the food was super delish"}
{"text":"Very pleased today at Vapiano. It was delicious, fresh, fast, and an good experience. The ambiance is so nice and relaxing. I went with some friends and I ordered the Shrimp Scampi. The food was so fresh. I also like the idea of ordering your foods to the cooks. It's a cool concept. I will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss, but the carbonara is always amazing. Today, we waited ten minutes on hold trying to place a to go order (normally the phone just has a busy tone and you have to keep calling), by which point we had already walked to the restaurant. After waiting 20 mins in line to order, we couldn't  find a place to sit. Most of the  tables were reserved for parties that never showed up. They allowed one person to put every single outside (first come first serve) table together to fit their volleyball team! When we left they only had 6 people at tables that could've accommodated 6+ different parties. They also ran out of forks....so spoons was what we were stuck with. We ended up asking for plasticware from the hostess. Not an ideal evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from the NY/NJ area and are picky about our Italian food.  We tried this place despite some of the negative reviews and found it to be pretty good food, service, and ambience.  The pizza was just ok, but the ravioli did not disappoint.  I like the concept of fresh, made-to-order Italian food in center city CLT.  This is long overdue!  We went later on a Friday evening after a night on the town, so the place was not packed.  The concept of having to order your food/drinks at different serving stations was not bothersome to us at all.  However, I could see where this might be challenging to navigate during really busy times like the lunch rush.  CLT needs some diverse food alternatives downtown, so I hope this place gains traction."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food are pretty good but beware at peak times.  Food is served in a high end cafeteria style but tables can be tough to come by since many customers hold tables against the rule of waiting until they have their food.  No policing of tables and bussing is very slow.  Line to pay can be long and slow.  Last time we had to request ice several times since fountain was out.  They also hold numerous tables as reserved causing more congestion.  A nice feature is the live soul music but it does cause difficulty in getting through checkout.    Cooks are generally very pleasant and courteous.   Very hard working.  Good for lunch, avoid at night or during rush periods as the place does not seem well managed."}
{"text":"Vapiano is one of my regular spots. Cool atmosphere and great food. I like the self-service model, the only downside is with groups as it is difficult to get everyone's food at the same time. The prices are very reasonable with most dishes under $10."}
{"text":"I have been here almost everyday ever since I have been in Charlotte. The prices here are reasonable and the ingredients are fresh. I love that they make the pasta in front of you and that the noodles are made on site. I have had their carbonara, chimichurri and vodka pastas. My favorite is the vodka sauce and my least favorite was the chimichurri which was too salty. The insalate de melone which has lettuce, watermelon, canatloupe and shrimps in it is the absulute best. Very refreshing and light for a lunch. Service here is OK, could definitely be better. I'll keep coming here for lunch during my stay in Charlotte and I'm glad theres a branch in NYC so when I go back I will be able to get my pasta fix on."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the calzone. My friends had the Caesar salad and sandwich. Great atmosphere. Lots of eye candy cooks. Will go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. But good. The service is super slow especially on weekends. Pros are the fresh pasta, and bread. Also super strong Sprite(I thought McDonalds had the best soda) & a con is the service, there's no reason to have 2 cooks on a busy weekend."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me. Very cool and yummy place! The ambiance and decor is REALLY nice. This restaurant has a cool concept... its like walking into a school lunch room cafeteria. There are different food stations that offer pastas, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. You go to the station you want and order and scan a plastic card, then you take a buzzer and go sit and wait for your food. The tables are high top wooden benches. They also have a loungey bar and dessert area. After you order and get your meal and eat, as you are leaving you pay at the register at the door. SO COOL! Food was really good too. I had a margherita pie and garden salad. Wasnt really a margerita since it didnt have fresh mozzarella but tasty none-the-less!  Just wish they had more food options! Would definitely come back next time i am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great pasta, and overall, everything I've ever had is delicious.  It's fast casual dining, not a sit down restaurant. Personally, I find the \"smart card payment system\" to be pretty confusing, given I'm not a regular, but I can see how it is efficient in the madness of downtown Charlotte lunch rush.  The \"smart card payment system\" is a pain when trying to order drinks at the bar when it's crowded.    Again though, all of the food is delicious.  Highly recommend the scampi e spinaci with linguini (you pick your own pasta noodles).  Very nice outdoor patio, with 4-5 small tables.  I will definitely continue to come back here."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch place in uptown. Caesar salad is the bomb."}
{"text":"Great food,great atmosphere,wonderful outdoor seating. I'll be there every time I visit Charlotte.   A Double A+ from a NY'er"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Vapiano.  Although I think the food is just okay, I really like the actual look and location of the restaurant.  I also like how you just go up to the different stations and load your card with whatever dishes/drinks you want (although I don't like the fact that everyone that enters the door must have their own card, as it can get confusing).  Also, be sure to make sure your bill is right before paying.  During one visit, I had apparently picked up the wrong card and was being charged for 3 meals that weren't mine."}
{"text":"The people who gave this place good reviews either had one too many drink special or have no taste buds. This food is bland as all get out. A jar of sauce is preferable, at least then there might be some kind of seasoning and nothing undercooked. This place is the restaurant equivalent of Kraft cheese - yes, it's technically edible, but why would you want to when there are so many better options?"}
{"text":"Trying to decide what to eat for lunch & walked by Vapiano's......Ordered the Carbonara with Salmon & side caesar salad & they didn't disappoint! Tht dish was absolutely delicious & cooked to perfection.   The cook was wonderful & no wait time, which was surprising for lunch time uptown Charlotte. The only problem is that I have to go back to work!!"}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant I was immediately in love with the atmosphere and the concept. Unfortunately, I was unable to order any food because I was immediately mocked and humiliated by the chefs at the food stations. Before leaving, I brought it to the managers attention who was apologetic but not phased by his employees unprofessional behavior. Still bummed and upset..."}
{"text":"This is our new go to pasta spot. It was a bit odd at first being handed two credit card type cards as soon as we walked in. I have to say at first the whole place was a tad intimidating to say the least!!! That said after a lil intro to how everything worked there it was all good!! Once past the learning curve we found an open table to place our drinks then on to the \"line\" to place food orders. There are many different items offered on the menu as well as the ability to pick and choose items to add or leave off. The portions are huge and very worth the menu prices. The only downside I see is there are no servers or anyone to obtain another drink or any other item once you are away from the food line or bar. It has an upscale cafeteria type feel that you have to tip. That said we will certainly be back and have been twice since our first visit, it's that good!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, good on its best day. I've had the Greek salad- not impressed, but liked two different kinds of pasta. The thing I hate is their \"system\" I'm never standing in the right line. In fact the time I got a salad, I thought I was standing in an order line for pasta, but was in the pasta exit line. I hate having to navigate the tight tables with a tray of food, only to have to add a drink (like I needed more stress) to then have to carry that sliding, spilling mess to TRY to find a table. The funny thing about this is the number of \"hostesses\" standing at the front doing nothing, instead of helping customers figure out lines or seating.  Bottom line, I never crave this food and it's just not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I LOVE this new spot - not just cause it is right by my office and I am lazy but I truly do love the food and concept!  The interior is totally zen and chic and not what you would expect for essentially a cafeteria.  Picking up the card at the door was easy, getting in line and getting a pizza was a breeze.  Getting a fab table and a water from the bar was super easy.  Just loved it.  I got the Toscana pizza and it was huge for only $8.95.  I had to take half of iit home.  I can't wait to enjoy the outside tables!  Our group is going for happy hour soon because they have good beer specials and a sexy bar.  Love it!  Such a step-up from Harry and Jeans!"}
{"text":"I really like this concept and their food.  Normally you can get in and our of there quickly during lunch but lately the service seems to have gone downhill.  I normally order a salad they have been taking forever.  I love that they make your salad to order but when there are 5 people in line ahead of you, it can take awhile.  this is my only complaint.  other than the service, great place for lunch. you can order pizzas, pastas,  sand, and salads..all very good"}
{"text":"My favourite place. They have amazing food for great prices in an awesome atmosphere. I always recommend it to out-of-towners"}
{"text":"This place is an interesting concept. When you first walk in, the person in the very front will hand you a card, similar to a credit card, then you go around to different stations and can order whatever you want from each. They track your orders on the card you received at the beginning of your visit. Once you order, you are given a pager.  When the chef has finished preparing your food, the pager goes off and you go and get it and bring it to your table.  Once finished you pay back at the front.    Overall, I have had very positive experiences with the food.  The staff have been friendly and the salads are large and delicious.  Overall, the prices are low too.  They also have a lot of fun drink specials on different days of the week which is always fun. It's not the fanciest of places,  but I have always enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti carbonara is great. The concept of paying after you leave is interesting but I guess it helps keep things efficient/moving in the place, which you gotta respect."}
{"text":"Food: Sandwiches are great! Pizzas are pretty good. Pasta is gummy and undercooked.  Atmosphere: Fun, loud, casual.  Service: Standing in lines is kind of fun and different and you get to watch your items as they are prepared. Self seating, self pick up of food."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love!! Fresh, Healthy and endless options! Now THIS IS HOW YOU RUN A RESTAURANT! Every time I go, it is clean, inviting, and smells like a garden is outside. Today I was served by Andrew Miller and he was excellent! Knowledgeable and entertaining. Helped me pronouce the pastas, described ingredients and sauces. I am thrilled and happy and can not wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Great staff , excellent food . Me and my partner went in for dinner today and we were very satisfied. We had the pasta made greatly, and very fast . Pricing was good-ish , I will definitely love to eat here again and maybe even recommend this place to a few people !"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Vapiano a handful of times, and I'm glad that I'm writing this review now, rather than after my first meal here. I was underwhelmed at first by the concept and ambience - maybe I was having a bad day or maybe I wasn't quite open to taking in Vapiano for what it is.   What it is: An upscaled a la carte dining experience where efficiency is a priority for a very reasonable price.  And for that, I think Vapiano is great and holds a special place in my hungry-for-Italian heart. I really like that their \"homemade\" noodles have a bit of a chew and are generally always cooked to a consistency that I like. I tried their pappardelle with bolognese sauce once and I've been hooked ever since. You can customize your order by adding basil, mushrooms, jalapenos, etc. according to what you like. I also appreciate that you can come in without reservations on a Friday/Saturday night and know that you will be able to find a seat, even if it is sharing a table with a few other people.   The only downside is you need to be prepared to speak loudly (kind of yell) in order to be heard by the pasta chefs sometimes, since they are in the midst of all the cooking sizzles. Last time, I asked for pappardelle and got tagliatelle instead. SAD FACE."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Everytime my husband and I are in Charlotte, we will come here...multiple times! I can never go wrong with the food.   The ambiance is great, big room, lots of tables and bar area and the food is delicious and not expensive. We love coming here because it makes it simple when it comes time to check out and pay for your meal. You pay for what YOU order without having to divide and separate checks.   Its like a Fancy Italian version of Chipotle, except they cook it fresh in front of your face.   My favorite items are: the Shrimp & fennel salad! soooo flavorful and different! Every person Ive recommended this to and has eaten it, all fell in love with it.  Spaghetti Carbonara with chicken. just be careful, its super heavy and i suggest you force yourself to share with someone because, i ate the WHOLE thing even though I knew i was full, but i couldnt help it. it was so creamy and tasty! bacon bits fried and mixed in with the chicken and pasta. topped with cheese. *drool*  Spaghetti and meat sauce. Its simple, but delicious. The meatball is very moist and the sauce isnt too overwhelming with marinara.  Although Ive heard great reviews on their pizza, I personally wasnt raving about it. I like thick crust, more carbs please! Its very fresh here, but too thin in my opinion. The hubby likes it though.  This is a great place for group dinner without the hassle of splitting checks. The foods great, theres live music sometimes, everyones responsible for their own orders, theres fresh herbs you can pick, and the cost is super duper decent. I cant wait to come back!!!   *warning* since they do cook your food fresh right there in front of you... you may come out of the restaurant spelling like pasta and pizza lol."}
{"text":"First visit, definitely not last. Excellent atmosphere, staff & food! The chef & bartenders were great. Informative and super friendly. Was told this was a franchise with local owners, well done! We will be back."}
{"text":"Ambience was amazing. The lighting, the minimalistic layout, the live plants were eye catching. As for the food, I had the lasagna al forno. It came out still sizzling! I loved the crispness of the edges and the softness of the middle. You receive a store credit card at the front desk and then you scan your card based on what you want to get at any booth. Great method of paying and preventing delays. I also had the sangria which was surprisingly strong but at the same time fruity and refreshing. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nothing quite beats hand-made pasta. That's just a fact of life. And if that isn't enough to convince you of this establishment's legitimacy, then you'll be pleased to know that EVERYthing on the menu is hand-made.   Of course, freshly prepared food at a fast casual restaurant is somewhat of a double-edged sword. Yes, food always tastes better when it's made in front of you and you can customize it any way you want (I'm always adding roasted tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic to all my pastas). However, there are still a few kinks this place needs to figure out before it achieves greatness. If you go at lunch time or the dinner rush, you could be waiting upward of 20 minutes for your order. Tip? Go one hr before or after 12 pm or 6 pm to ensure you get your food in a timely manner.   The system is simple. You receive a nifty little \"credit card\" where every purchase/order you make from any of the line cooks gets electronically added to your line of credit, which is pretty much limitless. At the end of your meal they swipe your card for the total amount and you pay as you exit. Unfortunately that leaves the onous on the customer not to misplace that shizzle. The size 6 font on the back of the card will inform you that it can cost $50 to replace if lost :P  What's particularly superlative about this place though is the FRESHNESS of ingredients. You can see the ripened juicy cherry tomatoes before they're sliced and put into your pomodoro, and the pieces of meat aren't pre-cooked, so they're tender when served. The pizzas are hand-tossed, with fresh basil growing in the back and homemade tomato sauce. Their oven also crisps the edges nicely. They even have other more authentic dishes like beef carpaccio and bruschetta, which are definitely worth ordering.   Interestingly, you don't have to come here just to eat, you can also just chill at the bar, which has great happy hour specials, genuine and kind staff, and a diverse selection of premium liquors. Fresh tiramisu is on display in a glass cabinet :P  I go here everyday and it's great to know a place that can cater to my Italian cravings and carb-heavy diet.   Shout out to Sim and Maurice :)  Don't forget the gummy bears on your way out!  4/5"}
{"text":"Family friendly place. My 2 year old daughter liked bread and ate 3 pieces.  Nice atmosphere and great food. We ordered beef n reef salad, chicken pesto pizza and bolognese pasta (with home made pasta) - all delicious. Plus you see through the counter how your food being cooked! All transparent."}
{"text":"Update: the restaurant is still wonderful and everything that is prepared is delicious and delivered quickly! This is a must stop if you're in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I was a little worried based on some of the initial reviews but I must say I like the concept at this place.  Yes, you don't technically have a waiter but they do have people that come by to clear bottles and plates.  Ordering your own food actually is a refreshing approach and I kind of like it.  The food here is cooked and made to order so it's fresh.  My biggest \"like\" about the place is the interior.  Super chic, trendy and candy for my eyes!  It's got a very large interior that affords larger groups the ability to sit together easily.  Also they have lounge areas where you can really kick back and stay a while with a cold beer and thin pizza.  I'll always prefer eating and drinking in a comfy chair/couch.  Major brownie points here from me :)  The outdoor seating is great too, but a bit small and the bench seating just isn't as appealing to me."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Unbelievably cool atmosphere that creates the appearance of high class but with family style Italian comfortability. The wooden tables have neat stone centerpieces built in. The lighting is a bit darker and adds a romantic feel which I didn't mind being that I was on a date.   Vapiano has adopted a different style of service with bar stations depending upon the type of food you want: pizza, pasta, salad, etc. We decided on the pizza station, and the specialty pizza which featured capers, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian sausage, and black and green olives. Pizza only comes in one size but it was still plenty of food.   The service here was great although it is basically self serve at the bar stations. You order, then take a pager and sit down; once your food is ready they place it on top of the bar and you place the beeper inside the basket. It was quite a seamless process and the food was ready in no time. The food was excellent, but I was even more impressed by the layout and design of the restaurant. Vapiano will have no trouble keeping its customers happy."}
{"text":"When things just doesn't go as planned with your night and you find yourself downtown with free street parking that just so happen to open up in front of Vapinos... it was meant to be!  Yep that was the start of my night and how I ended up here. A great place might I add and even better people. I ordered chicken penne pasta with a side salad and bread. Snagged a single girl seat at the bar and watched the football game that was on .  I honestly was enjoying EVERY MOMENT solo, side note to my single ladies great place to grab great food and take yourself on a date! When I was leaving a someone tapped me on my shoulder and I giggled because I thought someone I knew had saw me... to my surprise I had no idea who this 6'10 guy was but he was huge and handsome! We spoke a little, chatted some more over the FREE gummy bears , exchanged contact information {I usually don't do this but I was feeling froggy} and we said good night.   So yes take that dinner to Vapianos... YOU'RE WELCOME!"}
{"text":"Imagine a modern-day spin on your traditional cafeteria and add a decidedly Italian take on the cuisine.  Now then, you've got the concept for Vapiano.    In fairness, the food is cooked or prepared to order and you do pay at the end by basically tabbing out on the credit card you are given upon entry.  But, you do end up standing in line during busier times and everything is basically self-serve- from drinks to re-orders.  As mentioned by others, the space is quite open and expensive with chic modern lines and pops of color- from the red fabrics at the bar to the green herbs growing in small pots at both the tables and a middle display rack.  The high tables are nice, but I found the marble condiment and lamp holders cemented to the middle of the tables quite an impediment to speaking with your companions across the table or trying to share a plate.  My wife did, though, appreciate the purse hooks attached to the table sides.    On a weekend visit, the wife and I shared a roasted garlic pizza and an order of whole wheat spaghetti with arribiata sauce.  We both also had Cesar salads to start.  Salads were appropriately sized and priced for side items.  Lettuce was fresh and the croutons were plenty crunchy.  I'll agree that the Cesar dressing, while good, was a tad bit much for the portion served.  A little less would have been perfect.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and I give them bonus points for the wholewheat offering, especially since it is all made in-house.  The arribiata sauce was spicy and our \"cook\" offered to customize it to our preference.  Maybe it was the season, but a little basil or extra parsley could be used to balance it out a bit more.  Parmesan was available upon request.  One order is enough to feed a single person, but not so large as to be shared by itself.    Pizza was certainly large and likely could have been a meal enough for us both with our side salads.  Crust was thin and had a good tooth, but not wafer crispy- I like that, personally.  Again, the roasted garlic and cheeses were fine, but a bit of basil could have made this guy shine.    Prices were certainly not cafeteria range, but not so high as to shock the conscience.  The pizza seemed perfectly priced at about $9.00.  Almost the same for pasta and sauce seemed a bit out of range.  In all, this would be a fine place for a quick meal without all the formality of table service.  Certainly that has a nitch in uptown.  All the Italian standards are here, but, aside from a few pizzas, there is nothing new or creative here.  As the stars above say, it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Visited on 12/17/16 for a friends birthday and this was my first time coming.   The concept is to build your own pasta by picking different noodles, sauce, meat, and vegetables. There are different stations that you can go to and pick out what your having and be seated.  The pasta sauce was very bland and not flavorful at all. It was all over the place to me. I didn't enjoy the experience at all."}
{"text":"What a cool lunch concept!  I'm not understanding the horrible reviews -- if you want fine dining then go get fine dining this is certainly not it.  This is a quick, convenient, and tasty lunch option.  I had pretty much an hour with a client before I had to make the trek up to Mooresville (I'm from Atlanta) and my client suggested this as it's walking distance from her office and we wouldn't have to fetch cars from the parking decks.   When you walk in they give you a card and you can walk up to the pizza, pasta, or salad counters and order what you want.  Once you place your order, you get a buzzer and it will buzz when your food is ready for pick up at the counter.  The fountain drinks are in the back but water is in the front.  When you are ready to leave you pay at the counter.  I'm glad my client knew all of this because it was CROWDED and I would have been a bit confused with out her.   We both ordered the Margherita pizza.  It's huge! Both of us ate about half of ours.  It comes with fresh basil and tomato.  The crust is light and crispy and the sauce isn't too sweet or over powering.  I loved my pizza but the salads did look good as well!  I would definitely try one if i make it back."}
{"text":"This was the second time eating Vapianos. The first we dined there and our bill seemed to have things we did not order/receive. They quickly fixed that issue. The second was last night, we got a delivery. The food was incredible still. They read and completed all of our special requests except for one. As a server I do understand mistakes. I absolutely love this place!!! You would be silly not to try it! Especially on Sunday nights! 1/2 priced bottles of wine!"}
{"text":"The order process is a bit confusing at 1st. More cafeteria style than your typical restaurant. Food was ok and reasonably priced. Had the pesto panini With a side salad. Definitely not the traditional dining experience but it keeps things moving to avoid waiting. Best part? The gummy bears at the end of your meal"}
{"text":"My son and I ate here twice while in Charlotte, we enjoyed the pizza both times.  Love the order concept of a vapiano card to hold your order at the different stations.  This is defiantly marketed to the younger generation of simple with a modern design.   Will be sure to come again when back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The pizza was good. The sandwiches delicious. The salads were okay, but not bad.  We liked the atmosphere too"}
{"text":"Inconsistent, aggravated employees! I only get the insalata mista salad there and it is pretty good. I have decided not to order it with chicken since it cost $3 for literally 5 small chunks. The bar is cool and they have outdoor seating. I really like the concept, because it is hassel- free, but they need to work on retaining good employees to make sure their customers get the best possible experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The atmosphere was awesome and the restaurant is trendy - nothing beats the shiitake and oyster pasta and blood orange margarita!  YUM!!"}
{"text":"5 stars! Going back! Great place definitely worth checking out! I first went to Vapiano's with my roommate and her mom on her visit here. My first impression was great- a sign outside the place announcing their special of $3.50 OMB drafts.   Upon arrival the hostess greeted us with a big smile, asked if we had been there before and offered an explanation of how to swipe and dine! She gave us each our own cards to use, we grabbed up our own menus and headed to the table of our choice.   Above the food stations there is a huge chalkboard with fun sayings and drawings- nice touch! My roommate loved that each table has its own herbs you can pick off and use to add to your meal. Cases holding the herbs double as decor in this updated interior space.   I've been back several times since that first visit and have not been with anyone who has had a disappointing meal. Vapiano menu ranges in price from $3.95-$9.95! 5 main selections on the menu including: antipasti, insalate, pizza dela casa, pasta, and panini.    3/4 times I have visited, live acoustic guitar with great jams accompanied the already fun, inviting and laid back atmosphere.   Yay Vapiano!"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints. I have visited the Washington, DC location, but this was the first time dining at the Charlotte restaurant. I expected to notice some differences in the atmosphere and food, but thankfully it was all the same.   The food is made to order right in front of you. Which is great because you customize each dish to your liking. You also know that hot food you are eating is fresh and not some pre-made microwaved dish. The portions are large, so I would suggest sharing a dish if you aren't super hungry or just looking for a small bite in the middle of a work day."}
{"text":"Vapiano has lots of things going for it- great uptown location, young/hip ambiance, good food, decent prices! Everyone in my party enjoyed their food. I ordered the carbonara and it was delicious! It's probably not a traditional carbonara, but it was perfect for my American tastebuds. The side salads and bbq chicken pizza were also a hit. However, the ravioli and bruschetta were just okay.   What might throw you off, is the concept. You basically do everything yourself, except cook the food- and there is no direction given. I even told the hostess it was my first time, but I was just thrown to the wolves. Everyone gets a card that keeps a tab of the things you order at the various food stations. And you ask the cook to add a drink to your tab. This sounds okay. I mean, I loved not having to tip a waiter. However, things were kind of hectic and unorganized. By the time I got my pasta, other people had already finished theirs.  With that said, it's not brain science! I think w/ a little more organization, this place could be a favorite."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night. It wasn't too crowded but was pretty loud definitely a more modern establishment. Semi communal tables if you have a small party and a large large seating area. There was no help in how to order or what to do. If I hadn't been with a friend I would have been completely lost and likely left. Staff was very friendly all around but messed up one of our orders. This is an Italian place and she put spaghetti noodles when we asked for fusilli... not very similar. In addition my pasta was completely messed up. My pasta gained mushrooms which and I did not order and did not include spinach also when they put meat in your pasta it means like four pieces  What im confused about is the decor seems to clash between a Asian sir down place and a craft beer establishment. Almost none of it screams Italian. There are literally trees growing out of tables and a full \"tree bar\". I had heard great things so it's easy to be let down but the fact is we were not asked if we had been here before or knew how to order, which is a big deal since this is not a traditional sit down restaurant. Both my girlfriends and I's order was messed up and not once did we see any kind of manager present in the restaurant at peak dinner time. I can't say I won't be back but for 35 bucks it's not worth it honestly olive garden has better trained chefs and service professionals."}
{"text":"Pizza was ah ok. Being a pizza-aficionado I guess I'm hard to please. Good lunch spot. Very popular. PIzza was too sparse. Very commercial. Ingredients were fresh, cheese not the best but a quick spot to grab lunch. Sort of a cafeteria feel."}
{"text":"This would have been a five - except the ordering process was a tad confusing. We dropped in around 10 pm on a Saturday after a show at the Knight Theatre. We were handed Vapiano cards and told to ensure our order at each station made it to the card. We ordered carbonara in linguine to share and it was delicious! They don't skimp on bacon and the sauce was creamy without being overpowering. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Had heard about it around town but I didn't try it out until I made use of it's convenient location while on my way to a show at the Knight Theater. My sister and I were greeted and given the low down on how the place operates... A meal card gets you what you want from whatever station you go to.   We were mainly there for drinks, service was nice, as were the wine specials. They carried OMB and fat tire, in addition to the usual suspects. My sister got the greek salad, pretty typical but good. We sat outside, which is always nice to have downtown on balmy nights. Nice picnic table style seating, so not tripping over chairs and tables.   The ordering/paying process turned  out to be not as complicated as I thought.   I was also amused to see how casual everyone was considering it was during dinner on Saturday. Like jogging shorts, t-shirt, and flip flops were being sported by both sexes. Definitely not an uptight dining destination."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I was really impressed with the salad I got this most recent time! The first one or two times I went, the chicken seemed a little dry, but this last time was perfect! The black olives tasted a little off, overall great though!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how good my pasta was here.  Ordered penne with pink vodka sauce, chicken, and bacon. It was well made, and the house made penne was excellent.  Housemade dry pasta is rare for any restauant, especially mid price ones.  The penne had a depth and distinguishing flavor. Prices were very reasonable too , pasta cost $11.  Went back the next day for lunch and enjoyed my chicken pesto sandwich as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"recently dropped by the new Vapiano to grab a salad for lunch. Usually, I get the spinach salad with chicken ($9) at D&D across the hall from Vapiano or the the Grilled Tuna Asian salad ($9) from Arthur's. Both are large, hearty lunch salads that include lots of greens and protein. When I received the strawberry spinach salad from the kind person who made it, I opened it up to make sure there was something in there. Upon further inspection, the $3 extra I paid for chicken turned out to be seven dice-sized pieces on a bed of spinach with three strawberries, some pine nuts and four chunks of goat cheese. When checking out, I almost asked if I could return the salad for something less expensive when the total for just the salad was $14.98. Alas, I learned an expensive lesson that I should not return here for a salad. Perhaps I will try the pizza or pasta next time."}
{"text":"I was in town recently and thought I would try this place one more time.......without the drama of the X basket dropper  Unfortunately, they just don't have a good set up.  Staff still appears to be \"not pumped up about working there\"...thus continuing to impact have an all around great experience."}
{"text":"For fast casual this place is amazing.  This is what I call My way, right away. Pick your sauce, pick your pasta, pick you meat. They are crazy croweded during the week but they have their system down pat to get you what you want fast. I've had several different pastas and everything is always cooked perfectly right in front of me. The only thing I dont like is carrying a tray. I feel like I am back in highschool and bound to drop it and my food all over the place."}
{"text":"Always my favorite go-to place! Quick service, low cost (especially for the area). A good crowd pleaser that's sure to leave everyone happy and satisfied . I've tried something from ever part of the menu & have yet to be disappointed. Although, I would personally recommend the pasta-I mean how often do you get the chance to eat pasta that is made in house along with the sauce?!"}
{"text":"I first visited here with some classmates for a quick evening drink. The concept of this restaurant is pretty unique; the drinks were good, the service was fairly fast, and I enjoyed the fact that the food is made fresh to order. Although I wasn't \"wowed\" by anything, it had to be good enough for me to return a second time (with my boyfriend) and a third time (with some co-workers). Each time was enjoyable--I opted for one of the pizza's on each trip and wasn't disappointed. My only gripe would be they should offer some different varieties of the toppings--just something to switch up a little.  Other than, this is a great place to go downtown, although you'll want to get there early if you're going on Saturday; the place is shoulder-to-shoulder and you won't be able to get a seat for an hour or two, maybe longer."}
{"text":"I am major wary of anything cafeteria-esque.  That may make me a brat, but the idea of too many people having access to the food I will eat just doesn't sit with me.  I had heard that Vapiano was self-serve and had some assumptions that it wouldn't be for me, but the super fantastic daily wine special drew me in (I think $3 glasses until 7pm or something lovely like that).  The space is clean and nicely lit.  It definitely has a nice balance between modern and cozy.  You walk in and the hostess gives you a card, you pick a station (salad, pasta, pizza), tell the friendly people what you want, and it's made for you right there.  You just tap your card on the station and, viola! Good to go!  I've tried the goat cheese pizza and orange and fennel salad...both delicious.  It's a European concept restaurant so no tipping necessary and the prices are very reasonable.  I left a major fan."}
{"text":"As other Yelpers have mentioned, the staff need an attitude adjustment.  I mean who doesn't like cold pizza since you never rang our buzzer to come get it?  My bad!  The idea behind this restaurant has huge potential.  Too bad the staff has such attitude."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and it was very good. I'm in Charlotte for work and my coworkers brought me here and I loved the concept of getting a card ordering food and seating yourself and after completing your meal you just pay at the register. It eliminates the need for a wait staff and waiting to see receive your food. I got the Greek salad and must say one of the best salads I've ever had!"}
{"text":"for the money, this seems to be the best quality Italian I can find under $20 that I can get to go on the road. I had the spinach ravioli and asked for it spicy with extra red pepper flakes...wow, made to order, and on point! will go back next time Im in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good pasta's and great pizza's I was at Vapiano yesterday and from the time we were in to the time out, it was a great experience altogether. The restaurant is self service and has some good varieties of pasta's and pizza's. We were a group of four and hence settled for two pastas and a pizza which we later found to be apt quantity of food. The food was amazingly delicious and the freshness of the veggies could be felt with each bite. The prices are very affordable and it might just surprise you since the restaurant is well located in downtown. A must visit for food lovers."}
{"text":"Vapiano is the kind of place that's always there for you. What this means is that the food might not be Michelin star-quality, but the portion sizes are generous, service is quick, and there is always seating (helpful for large groups!)  The setup here is an interesting experience for new patrons, as you are handed a \"charge\" card as you walk in. As you walk up to each of the stations to order your food (which is cooked in front of you), your card is swiped and you pay for your meal at the very end of your visit.   Though Vapiano serves pizzas and salads, my go-to has always been the pastas. The portion sizes are HUMONGOUS, and the sauces tend to be extremely heavy and creamy (though theoretically I suppose you could ask for lighter sauce). Nonetheless, certain pastas such as the carbonara are so tasty so I personally feel it is worth the guilty pleasure - just don't forget to tell your cook to add some veggies!"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do i start with this place? First thing first, this place is definitely trendy and different compared to any restaurants I have been. When you first enter the restaurant you are given a card and you order food from different stations and at the end you pay off the balance on your card. The stations are pasta, salad, pizza and antipasti. Of course I was pretty confused since its my first time and I didn't know how to order food. But eventually I order the Carbonara Pasta with a side Caesar salad and a small Pana Cotta  The good: The pasta was very fresh, being hand made. Definitely not the store bought dry pasta. The pasta was also perfectly cooked to my taste. The Pana Cotta was the perfect ending to a lovely dinner. I was so stuffed from the pasta. Definitely bang for your bucks here.  The bad: being my first time here at a unique restaurant like this I wish I was given more directions than \"here is a card you order food  over there\". The Carbonara sauce was also a bit salty for my taste.  Overall would come back here again! This place is a go to place if you are craving some fresh pasta!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. A refreshing, hip alternative to regular dining.  The food is made fresh & cooked right before your eyes.  The service is fast & all of the staff is professional as well as accommodating.  We went on a Saturday so there was a live cover band that was AWESOME!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but not great and the portions are massive. The fun part of this place is the atmosphere and the unique concept of ordering and paying. The free I my bears after paying is the best part of this place!"}
{"text":"Vapiano's really fell off the cliff in quality between my first visit about a year ago and my visit last week.  The place was \"trendy\" as others have mentioned about a year ago, but on this visit everything looked very cheap or maybe just worn.   The food was the same story.  The two of us ordered a Caprese Salad, an Alfredo dish, and Gorgonzola pizza.    The Caprese was nice except they use sliced cherry tomatoes instead of slicing a nice beefsteak tomato or something similar.  The mozzarella was really good and fresh.    The Alfredo dish took a VERY long time to make.  They also didn't offer a buzzer to come pick it up when it was ready like they did the pizza.  We were forced to stand there for 15 minutes while it was completed, which is excessive.  The pasta was nice, but the sauce had that fresh out of a can that was sitting on the shelve for months taste.  The Gorgonzola pizza was extremely bland.  Again, the crust was nice, but the sauce had zero taste.  That is almost impossible with Gorgonzola cheese - but it happened.  The wine list was extremely cheap - most bottles topped out at $27 total.  There was a reason though, the wine was box quality stuff.  I am all for making it cheap and fun but there wasn't even one \"better\" option.    I don't think I will be going back any time soon.  The total bill wasn't that cheap that I can overlook the flaws in the food/service."}
{"text":"My go to spot for quick, fresh Italian food to go. The restaurant layout consists of stations for ordering pasta, salad or pizza. Seating is open through out. There aren't traditional servers. To order you go to one of the stations to order your selection and then take a pager, which is how they notify you your order is ready. There is also a bar for wine, cocktails and deserts.   On my First visit I had the carbonara pasta which was delicious.   Second visit had the shrimp Alfredo. The Alfredo sauce was made freshly so it took a little longer than my prior pasta experience. I believe my server may have been newly hired. The flavor was as powerful as the carbonara. I was bit disappointed with the tiny shrimp.  Third visit had the salmon Cesar salad. The Cesar dressing is very good and is freshly made in the restaurant. The portion of salmon was small to my surprise. Overall worth having again.   Finally I had the Americana pizza which was the best meal by far. Fresh, fresh, fresh! The sausage were very flavorful, it had a nice sauce and the a nice thin crust.   This place has become a favorite that I frequent at least 2 times a week."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and gor linguine bolognese. It's usually very crowded during lunch time but i waited for my food to be ready for only 10 min, which is pretty quick considering how many orders they have.  Pasta was good - i really like the interior design. I like their card system. I recommend this place to anyone who works in uptown.  They also have pizza and salad as well... and delicious desserts."}
{"text":"I suggest that you order the Carbonara. It is the mostly amazing thing at Vapiano, I get it every time. I will say that the different cooks that you get will determine how great your pasta is but I mostly have a great experience every visit. At Vapianos, they hand you a card that you can put all your meals, drinks, etc. and then you pay for everything at the very end. An interesting part of this place is that you can get free gummy bears at the register where you check out. Five stars for this restaurant because of the great service that they provide and the great tasting pasta they serve."}
{"text":"I am sadden by the downgrade of quality at this Vapianos. At first when this location opened, I was so excited. Over time, water cups got smaller, dessert portions got smaller, the quality of the pasta is not consistent, not even cooked the same depending on who is your chef. Honestly, I was a bit taken aback when I ordered the creme brulee and the barista poured sugar on top of my cream brulee and toasted it with a torch to make the sugar harden on top to create a crust, ehh...well anyway, I guess this is a very hands on kinda place so you won't find like a legit chef. But seriously, I am disappointed, because Vapianos has always been an all time favorite for me. And their bathrooms, needs serious attention, enough said.   $7.95 is the cheapest option for pasta, panini and pizza, goes up top about $12.95.  $2.95 is the cheapest for dessert, goes up to about $4.95.  $5.50 for sangria."}
{"text":"I like the concept of fresh hand-made pasta that you can mix-and-match and is made-to-order.  I'm just not convinced that Vapiano executed it well during my visit there.   I ordered the Arrabbiata with Tagliatelle noodles at a level 5 spiciness (the spiciest they had to offer).  First off, the spiciness level of 5 felt more like a 0.  I'm not sure I could taste any spice in it.  Secondly, the noodles clumped together, and therefore I had a few bites of balls of dough instead of individual noodles.  The bites that I had of the actual noodles were good, but the occasional clumps of dough were off-putting.  I also thought the sauce was pretty underwhelming, even not considering the lack of spice.  The ordering process was a bit confusing, but even after I got it down, it took a while for me to order and for me to get my food.  I had to wait by the counter for my food, too - no numbers or calling of names.  The space was nice, and the service was friendly (for a fast-casual restaurant).  The pricing was reasonable, too.  I just don't think they were able to execute the concept well enough, unfortunately, which lead to an underwhelming experience for me."}
{"text":"If you want a fast-casual italian restaurant with a different vibe then this is a place for you.  They've got everything from salads to paninnis to pasta! They've even got a bar! :)  It is a cool date night spot and has a great atmosphere. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Places to grab a quick bite. It's affordable with plenty of options. I had yet to have something I didn't like. I also love the atmosphere. I think it's so cute, light and airy but also quaint. Their salads are the bomb! My husband also loves their pizza and pasta!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here before the game!  Everyone was very nice.  Carpaccio plate is amazing!  Tagliatelle Alfredo with shrimp was so good!  I am not a huge fan of the concept, but the quality of food at this visit is changing my mind."}
{"text":"Good fresh food! Not too expensive. Salads are fantastic! Try the spinach & strawberry salad.  It is huge so you can split it and share a nice pizza with a friend.  Never tried this chain before.  Will have to look for it again."}
{"text":"If you love pasta, you will love this place!  Everything is fresh, even the pasta is made there. So when you walk in you will get a Vapiano's credit card, you go in and order whatever you want. They will charge that credit card, and you pay before you leave.   They have pasta, Panini, pizza, and calzones (which looks really really good, have yet to try). Then after you leave you pay. It gives you a really good vibe, and good food, what else can you ask for.  I had leftovers, and I think leftovers were even better.  I am defiantly going back, I have to try the calzone and get the sangria, heard good things about it!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love to go to Vapiano's during lunch but be aware that there is a line from 12-1:15 during the work week. It's so worth it though. They make their own pasta and cook everything in front of you. Additional add ons like meat and veggies  usually extra $3-4. I got shrimp and broccoli Alfredo and a side salad for $18 and some change."}
{"text":"I honestly use to eat at this at least twice a week. I'm not sure if it's new managers but there are new cooks and I must say the cooks are horrible. The last couple of times I been there the food has been horrible the cooks have had attitudes and don't take pride in cooking the food. Everything I've ordered before use to taste great but now i don't know what's going on but maybe the management need to taste the food before the cooks send it out or hire better cooks but the people working on the PASTA BAR is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Ok I really enjoyed the food it was great!!  However the staff were very unfriendly!!!  1st off the cooked messed up my order and forgot to give me my salad I ordered then had the nerve to have an attitude!  (He was a African American young man with braids or dreads) he was in the pasta section.   We also ordered pizza and that man had an attitude as well. This was my 1st time here and I was excited bc I read the reviews and the inside is really nice....but the customer service was terrible!  Fix it!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place to eat at in Charlotte.  The place is inviting and sexy.  I love the pizza, pasta and salad! Great for a date, enjoy with a group of friends or a night out with the girls.  I prefer to go mid-afternoon right before it gets busy for dinner.  Enjoy with your favorite wine, beer or soft drink!"}
{"text":"The dining layout gives you Pizza Boutique vibes with high top tables, live plants and fresh oil and vinegar on the tables. Quality furnishing I might add because I have never seen a more lavish highchair for my 1 year old. The ambiance is  open, warm and welcoming.pizza was perfect and lightweight. It has a thin rustic crust. The Bruschetta Pizza consists of fresh chopped, marinated tomatoes, garlic, rocket, Grana padano D.O.P, tomato sauce, mozzarella. The size was intimidating but the pizza was light enough to handle solo. We nibbled on the pasta and took some home. The pasta reheated nicely. The pasta actually wasn't sauces enough . The chef kindly made a fresh pasta for me !"}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time last week. VERY cool concept. Relatively casual dining and very fast. Lovely bar facing out to Tryon. You'll need a tray, so it's a cafeteria-style, with a twist. What I liked: They give you an e-card and menu at the door. Then, at the stations where you order your food, the cost is loaded onto your card and you pay at a central register. Speeds up ordering. Easy for separate checks, couples in a party of four or more or easy for one person to pick up the entire tab by grabbing all cards. Food was really good! LOVE the open \"air\" wall to Tryon Street. We sat on the patio in the middle of the Tryon Street sidewalk. Fun! Only minor complaint: I felt pressured to order fast (like on Seinfeld). Advice: hang back and decide what you want before stepping up to the counter to avoid that issue. Lots of stations, so look it all over first."}
{"text":"Pretty cool idea and the prices are really reasonable for downtown. I wish the directions of what to do were explained to us a little more clearly (such as order drinks when you order your food at the counter). Staff was nice and tolerated my son and another child wandering around playing with their holiday decorations. Food was decent. Ambiance was nice. Great first date idea or group dinner idea. Nice bar area. Parking is a nightmare but if you park at Fitzgerald's parking garage you can validate your parking ticket with the restaurant receipt and you get free parking."}
{"text":"I love the concept here of placing your order on cards. I love to take my friends here. and enjoy the fresh made pasta. if you have time, try the sangria."}
{"text":"This is the Ikea of italian food. An entire dinner with a cocktail for $14- awesome!   The place is super modern looking with potted herbs as decor. I felt more like I was in a modern day cafeteria than a restaurant. I liked it - but perhaps dim the lights a tad in the evening.   I started with a super/fresh delicious strawberry mojito. Since it took a few minutes to serve us, the bartender served us up a complimentary shot -which was a great touch. He was one of the friendliest bartenders I've come across in awhile. I went with pizza  for dinner- the salame, which was good not great. It tasted like regular peperoni  (not a favorite of mine) and needed a little more sauce. My friend had the bruschetta pizza which looked killer, so I'd get that next time. The portion was huge and at a little over $7 it was a steal!   Some people do not like the cards, but I felt like it was great. They definitely passed the savings onto the diner without skimping on quality ingredients. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot- fair prices for handmade pasta and sauce that is made in front of you."}
{"text":"This place was just down the street from the Financial District; it looks fairly new and I am a little curious why it wasn't more crowded, but it was just 5:30 on a Friday night.  It seems like the downtown needs a shot in the arm, and I would suggest Vapiano as a great place to come down to start your evening.  The pasta is build your own or select from the suggestions.  I had the tagliatelle with bolognese and a side caesar salad.  Everything was really tasty but I think I will order a little differently next time.  Not quite Calzone's but a good fast Italian.  They claim the pasta is made on site daily, and you can tell; the taste is much better and the pasta isn't slimy like packaged pasta.  I liked the \"credit card\" style of paying for the meal and being able to go to the stations.  Real plates and flatware, and a very stylish (and large) interior seating area."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick lunch. If you get here ahead of the lunch rush you get your food in about 5 minutes. Plenty of choices as they have salad stations, pizzas, paninis, and pasta. Haven't been to dinner or late night here but good for lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"Interesting little space. The idea, however, is a lot better than the execution. It's almost like a cafeteria in that you can serve yourself. In case you forget to do that, you're pretty well out of luck, because service is a bit hit or miss.  Luckily, the environs are awfully nice to look at, so you might be distracted enough not to notice.  Perhaps one of the most annoying things about Vapiano is that there isn't a whole lot of service - from drink to food, just about everything is serve yourself, and there isn't really anything explaining that. So you walk in, see this great space right on Tryon Street, and... nada. No explanation of what you are supposed to do, nothing.  If you should happen to want a drink, you can saunter up to the bar and you might be helped by someone. Or maybe not. It's that bit that's the most frustrating. If you actually get something, then all can be good, because it's quite decent. It's just the process that really screams for help."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the ambiance. It's a large restaurant with lots of open space and seating. The tables are beautiful and long and adorned with rosemary or basil plants that you can pick off and add to your entree.  It's a card style ordering model and you walk up to each area and order your food. You scan a card and pay at the end. Whatever is accrued on the card will be paid when you're done.  I like spicy, so I went with the arabiatta sauce. They spice it with JALAPEÑOS! That's...different. I mean, I like jalapeños, but that seemed like anything BUT Italian. It was just okay and not as spicy as I would've liked.  The bruschetta was okay, but the pesto was better. It was probably the best flavor out of everything we ordered.  I couldn't resist a balsamic salad and I consider myself kind of a connoisseur, but it tasted like bottled Kraft dressing! It was thick and syrupy, almost like corn syrup was in it. It was also too sweet.   The tables had chili oil, balsamic and EVOO, but no Parmesan. I would've loved that to dip my bread into.   The lasagna was also just okay. The theme of our visit was just... OKAY.   Other than the awesome ability to host a big group of friends and have it be nice-casual without the awkwardness of bill-splitting, this place gets a pass in my book."}
{"text":"This place is very modern in looks but I have to say my pizza was okay.  You pretty much serve yourself , when we walked in the hostess handed me a card like a credit card sorta.  Really gave no direction as to what to do , I wasn't impressed.  You decide if you want pizza, pasta or another choice an go stand in that line an you get your drink an serve yourself unless its an adult beverage you go to the bar. They do have a nice ice cold  water station I did like that. I ordered the pizza Hawaiian an bruschetta it was okay. But if your downtown you should try it an they have gummie bears  for when you leave mmmm I did get some they were chewy gummie bears lol"}
{"text":"Please fix this restaurants ordering process. This really upsets a lot of people bc it's so unorganized. And the chefs don't look like they enjoy cooking for customers that come up to the window. The line up process is wrong. People don't know where to line up and end up cutting in front of you. Just let people order at ONE central window or area and then bring it to their table or call their name or number. The way you are doing it is making a lot of people mad.  The carbonara linguine is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Considering how nicely decorated and *huge* Vapiano is, it has some major potential. I've seen reviews across the board and while I definitely gave Vapiano a fair shot, I was very underwhelmed.   The Good: It really is a beautiful place with a gorgeous bar, low key dining tables with fresh potted herbs and a super convenient location if you live/work Uptown. The host and cooks were friendly and informative overall. I didn't have a problem with the swipe cards, although I kept a close eye on my own!   The Meh: The prices were a tad bit high in my opinion, but I'd be fine with them if the quality matched the price tag. I'm not a huge fan of this concept, in general. If I am going to shell out $30 for pizza and salad, I'd at least like a bit of table service.   The Bad: The food. Sorry. I didn't really enjoy anything that I ordered/tasted - details below. Also, I was a bit peeved when I couldn't get a tiramisu (stationed at the bar) to go. I understand they are made in rocks glasses, but please offer a bit of customer service and check if they can be made in a transportable vessel. I imagine they'd sell a ton more, too.   -Pomodoro e mozzarella pizza: 2/5: Total snoozefest. The pizza was lukewarm, limp, a bit soggy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella wasn't melted at all and there was zero crisp to the crust. Even the basil looked sad. I had to pile on the crushed red pepper and parmesan to get through it.   -Side house salad: 1/5: Looks like bagged salad mix and the house dressing had a super funky aftertaste to it.  -Side Caesar salad: 3/5: This broke my heart because the dressing, croutons, parm shards, and romaine had major potential. Taste was spot on, if a bit thick. However, my poor lettuce was positively drowning in dressing.   The best part of my meal here? The gummy bears on the way out."}
{"text":"Yummy this place is really good. Best pizza best pasta best food all around. Also a nice big bar. And open late."}
{"text":"Food is very inconsistent sometimes it's great and other times it can be really bad. I keep giving them another chance. Hopefully it gets better and more consistent."}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta in a lounge atmosphere. Fairly casual but you can see when you chef bakes your pizza or makes your pasta. Very good food at a fair price!"}
{"text":"It's like an Italian chipotle. It's a great dining experience but wish they had more special dishes..just feels okay not great.."}
{"text":"My friend called Vapiano's \"the Ikea of Italian cuisine\" and I think it sums it up pretty well. The space feels modern and clean; however the food feels very uninspired and with only decent taste and quality.   I don't find Vapiano's very interesting in terms of food; they serve very run-of-the-mill pizza and pasta.  The biggest drawl is the 5-dollar pizza, which is affordable."}
{"text":"If you want to eat the best Greek salad you have ever had, come to Vapiano.  I am not exaggerating, this is ridonculous.  It may not be village style or traditional, but in addition to your standard kalamata olives (and plenty of them), feta, cucumbers, and finely diced onion, they have added CAPERS and pretty pretty dill. I believe it's the combination of the capers and the dressing that takes this salad to the next level.  The dressing (which I asked for on the side) must be nectar of the gods. I don't know what's in it, but it took my day from 0 to 10 in the first bite. I can only imagine how french fries would taste dipped in the dressing, stop it just stop it now!  I can't recommend any of the other items as I have not eaten anything else, but I will be back any time I'm craving a Greek salad (averaging once a week)."}
{"text":"As this place just opened 3 days ago, i need to be a little easy.  The food was good, fresh.  Almost too fresh,   we waited 10 minutes for a drink to be made as the bartender had to cut the fruit.  Lines were long for food as well, the staff seemed unprepared.  They also take the self service too far.  A staff member came by and asked how things were and I asked for water and was told to go to the bar and get a glass then go to the water station.  I will come back next time I am in Charlotte to see if the bugs have been worked out"}
{"text":"Only had drinks. We didn't eat but the food looked and smelled great. Prices were very reasonable. We only had drinks but the place was packed and we were immediately served. Bar staff was wonderful. It's a neat concept and we all def return."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in Charlotte! I would definitely go back next time I'm uptown. The restaurant is very chic, and the service is quick. Great for a night out on the town."}
{"text":"What. a. bummer.  Having ordered the underwhelming panini last time, I was kinda excited to try their pasta.  But that dish, as well, was meh.     I ordered the aglo e olio, which is a basic pasta dish.  Generally, it's spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, and one can dress it up a little with parsley, chili flakes, or whatever.  I rarely put anything else - especially, since I heard that their pasta is all made in-house.  Pure pasta and nothing to hide its integrity - yum... or not.  I thought homeboy had whipped up my dish a little too quick, and that was the case.  The spaghetti was undercooked and clumped together.  There I was trying to talk shop with some folks, and my lunch was difficult to eat.  Instead of normal bites of pasta, or trying to be high-class/fancy/sophisticated and getting nice spoonful portions of spaghetti together, it looked like I was trying to eat golf divots - just massive clumps.  I gave up after awhile as it no longer looked nor tasted particularly appetizing.    Kinda relieved that our monthly lunch meetings are no longer going to be here.  It's for the best - some of us that order paninis get an alert thing so they can sit at the table and retrieve their panini when ready, while some of us have to stand at the pasta station until the food is ready.  Enough lost time that it's inconvenient when ordering different types of dishes.    For those reason, three stars becomes two stars. Vapiano, if you're looking for more stars, they might just be buried in that mess of a spaghetti dish!  dmo out"}
{"text":"Unique place for Italian lunch on a Sunday-as you know in CLT there is not much open for lunch in uptown and this place would be great for kids and adults alike. Lots of variations on pasta, salads, and pizza. I had the Caprese pizza-good and my husband had the lasagna-another good one.   Casual/modern setting, order at a station and then p/u your food when ready. They use a card system to pay which is effective  For their ordering/buzzer system."}
{"text":"Despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, I cannot in good conscience give a good review.  Vapiano is a European concept Italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).  Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  Each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  Sort of awkward in my opinion.  Vapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.  After my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.  I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.  Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.  The last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!  As I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  Had she heard it before?  Did she not care?  I paid and left.  Insects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.  I give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness."}
{"text":"It a nice spot to grab lunch, dinner. Solo or with someone. The Americano pizza is what I've gotten the last 2 times there.   You are greeted at the door by a host. He/She will ask if you've been there before, if yes.. then a menu and a \"pay card\" is handed to you to proceed.  If NOT... he/she will go through a brief info session (20sec or so) on how everything works.   Go try it out.... the place is nice and roomy.    Cheers"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Delicious food for a great price and a nice atmosphere. Good for date night or a stop while you're bar hoping. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I initially liked the concept at Vapiano - when you walk in the door, you get a nifty credit-like card to record your purchases and a menu to help you decide.  You order at the whichever counter(s) you choose (pizza, pasta, salad), watch your food being prepared in front of you, and pay on your way out.  The problem occurs when you want multiple items, or when you are with a friend. You must wait at separate stations, and the waits are usually long. It took me and a friend 45 minutes one Friday evening to get our food (when they would NOT even be considered busy). I would rather they switched to a concept where you order all of your food at once, then sit down and have them bring it to you (similar to Figo in Atlanta). It's much more customer service friendly, in my opinion.   Being a pasta lover, I usually get the pasta. You choose your pasta and sauce separately. And there are quite a few options, although no angel hair pasta. I tried the pappardelle with funghi (creamy mushroom) sauce on one occasion. I was surprised at the generous portions. What a great value for $7.95! And, most importantly, it was delicious! My favorite so far, though, is the pesto e spinachi - a cream based vegetarian dish with pesto and fresh spinach. It's $8.95, and also a good value.  The food can be somewhat inconsistent and is sometimes bland, however. It really depends on the \"chef\" at your station. On my most recent visit, my pesto needed the basics, like salt and pepper. My friend's pomodoro was so bland that she didn't even get close to finishing it.  But, I have to mention the BREAD. I'm picky about my bread, and theirs is AMAZING -- crispy crust, moist, chewy center. It's included, so don't miss out!  I have been here several times, and have downgraded my initial 4 star rating to a 3 star one for the reasons mentioned above. It's still a good place if you are dining alone, but it wouldn't be my first choice for dining with friends again."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Wednesday night, with a guy from Italy desiring food from home. Boy did he get his wish. We ordered carbonara, scampi, and the capricciosa. This food was very authentic (according to him). The atmosphere is fun, rustic, and homey. The style restaurant is to order then pick a table by open seating. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a delicious meal at a reasonable price in uptown."}
{"text":"I came to this place when it first opened and was very impressed by the style and layout of the restaurant.  I was classy and elegant, but casual at the same time.  The décor is great, they have plants on each table and a tree in the middle of the restaurant-giving it s very fresh, earthy vibe.    The service was good, it's almost like a self service place, so there isn't a lot of interaction with the staff, but when choosing your food, they are exceptionally helpful.  The food was decent.  It was not the absolute best Italian I've ever had, but it was not the worst.  I would definitely be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Great place for groups fresh food all homemade pasta lots of variety and a good amount of seating. This place does not have waiters so it is a seat yourself and order based on what you wants type of mentality. You use cards to charge what stations you want to eat from and at the end everything is put together into one bill. The food is good and caters to pretty much everyone's wants and needs I had the surf and turf pasta with a little bit of beef and some shrimp over with a white sauce it was good however I think the traditional pasta dishes are a safe bet and have never treated me wrong. The bar is fully stocked wine is good quality inn does not cost an arm and a leg and they always have heavy pours. This is good for families or four individuals I would recommend this place to most people."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and this was highly recommended by friends and it did not disappoint!  When you walk in the host hands you a card that you will use to swipe after ordering anything you want to eat or drink. All you have to do is walk up to the station you want to order from, place your order and swipe your card. In a few minutes your meal will be ready - and its all delicious!  I ended up ordering pasta (which is all made fresh in the restaurant) I got the Estiva which was cooked in a light sauce - it was good but to me it could have had a little more flavor. The chicken was very plain and the sun dried tomatoes seemed to be over powering for the dish.   The pizzas all looked and smelled amazing, I will probably try one the next time I go. my friend ordered the Strawberry Salad which was absolutely delicious very crisp and fresh!  When you are done eating they have bussers that will come clean your table. You take your card up to the host and she was scan it and that's when you pay.   Don't forget to grab some gummy bears on your way out - they're free!"}
{"text":"TASTY PASTA FOR DECENT PRICE AND LARGE SERVING!  My friend and I were on a business trip in Charlotte and without knowing anywhere to go, decided on Vapiano for lunch. The restaurant is an interesting concept - each person is given a plastic card to keep track of their meal purchases and you pay on your way out. It's simple, convenient and you don't have to fuss with divvying up a bill if you are with a large party. I only went here once and here's what I have to say about my experience:  1) FOOD (4/5): I ordered the CHICKEN ALFREDO (Chicken Breast, Cream Sauce, Parmesan) with Rotini noodles. The PASTA IS FRESH - they open up an individual size serving and mix it up with the sauce and chicken in a wok like mixing bowl. The PORTION SIZE WAS HUGE - easily enough for 2 meals. I don't know why I decided to try and eat the whole bowl...I was stuffed for the rest of the day. The sauce was CREAMY and there was enough of it to coat the noodles. I also had 2 slices of bread which were also SOFT and FRESH. There's olive oil and vinegar on the table. My total was less than $9.00 - SO INEXPENSIVE! My only complaint is the toward the end of my dish, the pasta got kind of sticky.  2) SERVICE (3/5): Nice, pleasant work staff. A woman came to clear our trays.  3) ATMOSPHERE (3/5): This is THE PLACE TO GO if you're working in the area. The place was so busy around lunch time, but not sooo busy that we had to wait in line long. My friend and I had to wait in line behind 1 person who was ordering - so really, not bad at all. The inside is like this clean, sleek cafeteria with nice interior and different areas to sit - high table, low table, on a bench or sit on a chair.   BOTTOM LINE: I RECOMMEND this place to anyone in the area who is looking for GOOD, CHEAP FOOD! It's a nice clean restaurant and would definitely go back. After looking at their website, they have a Vapiano is Boston but the prices are more expensive! :(  * check out the food and interior pics I posted *"}
{"text":"After two negative experiences with food, I have to update my rating. Had the RAVIOLI RICOTTA E SPINACI. It was extremely bland. I thought there was going to be actual pieces of spinach in the ravioli, but it was more like spinach flavored ricotta cheese. And the tomato sauce couldn't save it. Just terrible all around. Also had the pesto pasta with shrimp on a  Saturday night when they have jazz. It was all I could do to eat this crap. AND there were only THREE LONELY SHRIMP in the entire dish. I know for a fact there are supposed to be more shrimp. I am disappointed at the quality of food I've experienced as of late. I understand people want to be healthy, but PLEASE use some salt or spices or something because at this rate I'll never be returning for the food."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!!! I always get pasta!! Shrimp Alfredo is my all time favorite !!! My husband loves the pizza ! Such a tasty place with a cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat! A unique twist to service, and the food was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places to go to for lunch!  Lots of options to customize makes it easy to always try something new.  If I could, I would be there every day! Love the Carbonara Pasta and the Greek Salad!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????? ???????????????????????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????????????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????"}
{"text":"I loved the pasta I had at this place. Too bad it's an east-coast only restaurant. I chose a pasta (which I forgot the name of) and went with the employee's sauce suggestion. It worked out pretty well and I ended up liking it. I thought the sauce was a little too salty but the pasta itself was al dente.   The cool thing about this place is the payment process. So basically you get this card that you lay on the table (while making your order). The order you make gets tied to that card - so that later, you get charged upon returning it. After making your payment, there is also complimentary gummy bears at the front desk. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Was funny. It took me some time to understand what's going on here. The place is right for dates, not for romantic dinners. The way they works is for me a little strange, but the food is really good. The bar is a little far and you need to go there anyway if you want something to drink. The wine menu is rich and you can buy even the bottle!!! And them go back to your table. So, the way you pay at the en is more than strange, you pay drinks on the bar and pay for food on reception (((( I don't know who is idea was but it's bad."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy with Vapiano.. I have eaten here twice with my colleagues and both times, the food was really good, and the service was pretty speedy.   I highly recommend the strawberry spinach salad.. all the pasta items I tried were pretty good as well!  Overall, seems like a very dependable place with a set of solid food options.  I just found out there's a Vapiano in NY as well.. I plan to try it soon!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch or an early dinner, Vapiano is the lunch spot to beat in Uptown Charlotte.  Whenever me and my friends or coworkers don't know what mood we're in I suggest this restaurant.  Vapiano is fast, fresh, and interesting.  Their pasta is always made fresh and entrees are cooked in front of you to order.  The herb plants at each table add a little fun and freshness, although I have never tasted pasta from here that needed additional taste.   Pros:  -Fast service -Intriguing fast casual restaurant model -Nice decoration/storefront/ambiance    Cons:  -Smaller portions.  -Despite the small portions the food here is dreadfully unhealthy. -Can be busy during peak hours. -Price is high considering the fast casual nature and cuisine."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here a week ago and loved it. They cook the food right in front of you and give you some bread on the side. You are giving a card they charge you for your meal and beverages. The prices are fair but they give a large portion of food. The staff is awesome and I'd recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"The concept around this restaurant is very cool and different.  The quality of the food is great and you get to watch the chefs prepare most dishes right in front of your while you wait.  Any of the pasta items are wonderful.  The place is slammed during lunch.. go at 11:30 to avoid the rush if you're in a hurry.  The reason this is 3 stars and not 4 or 5 stars.  It's ridiciulously overpriced.  You're going to pay $13, $14 or even $15 for a pasta lunch.  While the food is amazing, it's not really worth cost."}
{"text":"Was uptown for a Festival and just so happened to walk past \"Vapiano\" and thought we would try it out since it looked cool from the Outside. When we walked in the Hostess informed us about the \"Cards\" that track everything you order, and that we just swipe it at the stations whenever u order something, and then when we are ready to leave we just bring it back to the Hostess to cash it out and pay. I have to say I quite enjoyed this concept. I guess in a way its kind of like a fancy Cafeteria, but I liked the whole concept. I ordered a Chicken Panini with side Salad and it hit the spot. The decor of the restaurant is cool and very zen with the Trees in the middle of the table. Will definitely be back to try it out again.... this place is great for lunch or for a cheap dinner."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant with the cool buffetish style meal, but in the end the food was great, the workers were helpful and the gummy bears on the way out topped it off, 10/10 would bang again."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a serve-yourself restaurant - you still feel as if you're in a nicer sit down restaurant even though they don't serve you are your table. It's also a good place to drop-in on a Friday night downtown and not be crowded. The ambiance and decor makes it fun to sit and talk. They even have a small herb garden growing that you can pick and add to your own dishes.  The pasta spinacci e pesto (forgive the spelling) is always a good bet but look for the specials when you come in. A little spicy oil and balsamic goes great on the bread you get with your meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. I was shocked to see such a modern pasta bar on Charlotte, NC, but then again Charolette surprised me in general. Go here if you're looking for good pasta at a decent price in a nice setting. This is where you should go without breaking the bank, but to also have a great experience."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Alfredo and it was made perfectly!  Love the concept and the staff!  So much to try here you can definitely have a new experience every time.  The desserts were also wonderful.  This is a great place to go with friends so you can try a little of everyones creation.  Pay attention to the options and ask for what you want to create an amazing dish."}
{"text":"Nice upscale pizza, pasta & salad restaurant with a full bar. Upon entering, they'll give you a card to swipe at each station you go to and order food & drinks on. It's located downtown Charlotte, NC so we parked in the parking deck that's $10 on weekends. It's located within walking distance"}
{"text":"Totally different concept. Completely new thing for me was you can choose your cook who will prepare your food.  I picked not one of the bests'. My cook messed my food .sorry."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for supper. Interesting concept..... We were handed cards and told that everything is self serve. You swipe the card and added to a tab associated with the card. Your food is prepared right in front of you and doesn't take long at all. The food overall was good. Will try this place again when back in the area"}
{"text":"Fell in love with this German concept in Mannheim. Whereas here you do not have to fight for your place in line to get your ready cooked pasta, salad, or pizza, the reward is good, but not always very good. The cook staff is kind and attentive but struggles to prepare consistent dishes  (or know/remember the ingredients). Deserts are great although recently shrunk in size. Still Vapiano is a solid standby when craving fresh pasta, Euro atmosphere, good bread, and rich deserts. Self seating is easy and convenient, especially with larger groups."}
{"text":"Walked in at 1130 on a Friday night. Door said they close at 12 midnight. I just wanted to get a pizza to go but wasn't greeted and ignored by the 8 staff members standing around. Hostess walked past me asking how I got in. Apparently they were trying to close early. I asked if I could have pizza to go and she said \"up to you\" and walked away. Suggestion - Change your hours if you don't want to serve customers."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day and I thought it was great. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious, the prices were great, and the place was clean. I liked it so much that I went back there on a date. The place was a mess, the staff were unprofessional, and the food was disappointing. They used deli sliced chicken on a popular italian sandwich, where it's customary to use grilled chicken breast."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp + spinach in a pesto cream sauce. Enjoyed the food. Very fresh tasting and a good value for the price. On a side note, Lisa really sold the food + the wine. Appreciated her enthusiasm!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a coworker who had been there before and recommended it.  Neat concept, explained by many other reviewers so I won't rehash it.  The prices are reasonable, nothing over $9.95 on the menu unless you add extras.  I ordered the Verdure which has Roasted Eggplant, Zucchini, Red & Yellow Peppers,  Mozzarella Cheese, Pesto, Spinach.  My coworker ordered Pasta, the Ravioli Ricotta e Spinaci which is Ravioli With Spinach And Ricotta Filling, Tomato Sauce.  His Pasta was made before my Panini, but only by a minute or two.    The Panini seemed a little on the small side, but was enough fill me up.  The house salad was nothing special.  Iceburg lettuce with shredded carrots and some tomatoes.  The didn't ask about dressing, so I am assuming there is only the house dressing which is an Italian.   My Panini tasted OK, but it was not grilled long enough.  There were light brown grill marks on the bread and the veggies inside were cold to luke warm and the mozzarella wasn't melted at all.  I should have taken it back and had them grill it more, but since my coworker already had his meal I decided not to because he would probably be done with his meal by the time I got my sandwich re-grilled.  I probably will give Vapiano's one more try and get the pasta or pizza next time to see it is better.  If you are heading here for a Panini, skip it and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Middle aged woman alert- I find the concept a little bizarre. There is simply too much going on for anything to be particularly noteworthy. Maybe, I'm just not hip enough. Mediocre pasta, there is no service. If there where no other restaurant on the planet, I suppose I would return. Also, incredibly noisy at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Ummmm why isn't this a place everywhere? FRESH PASTA! And it is affordable. They have every choice and very accommodating for diet restrictions too. Also, the desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"Very good.  Reasonable prices.  I had a Caprese salad and Bolognese with fresh made Parpadellei.  A lot of food for about $20. They gave me a nice take away box that I can microwave in my hotel room later this week.  I ate alone and wished I had company.  This is a nice place."}
{"text":"OMG. The best pasta everrrr ! I always make sure I stop by here on my travels to Charlotte. You choose what you want to put in it and they make the pasts right in front of you. They also have a pizza selection that they make in front of you too for the pizza lovers. The atmosphere is pleasant and very cute for dates !"}
{"text":"It was SO much fun to have our pasta cooked to order while we waited and designed our dishes. I brought my 10 year old daughter with me to Vapiano's for dinner and she absolutely loved the concept. Pasta is her #1 favorite food and this place had her utterly impressed. I thought it was pretty fun and unique myself. Though I've passed this place a few times, I was not aware of the system. Love how you customize your noodle choice (e.g. campanelle) and the sauce (or choose one of the recommendations).... Also, the bread was 5* which, IMHO, is a critical component of a good pasta dinner. We really liked our food and shall be back!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 1 star because it's the lowest possible rate I am allowed. If it was possible I would put 0 or negative stars. The service is absolutely horrible, customer service is non-existent. I was in today and found hair in my food, when I reported it to the chef and kindly requested another dish the request was denied. The chef started talking with another employee about my complaint and they laughed about it, I told him to just forget it and started walking away. The chef then started using profanity and called me out my name. I reported the incident to management and nothing was done to correct the problem. The service is horrific to say the least and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and will never visit this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"What I like about this restaurant is the ease of use with groups. Upon entering you get a card that you swipe when you order anything. Upon leaving, you present your card where your charges are all stored - and you pay either as a group or per person. Makes check splitting easy. I wasn't pleased with the pace though. I stood and waited for my pasta and salad for a good 10 minutes awkwardly at the 'bar/cooking area.' You order, they make one dish at a time, hand you your plate on the counter, and then the next person orders. Highly inefficient and for such a pretty place, it feels like a cafeteria. The food itself was fresh, but just okay. Not good for a date or business lunch, but good for groups or a casual meal."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I definitely need to get here earlier to enjoy a meal here!   On Saturdays the restaurant closes at 12 midnight, but then it turns into a nightclub with a dj or band. Last night they had a dj. The cover is $10. My gripe was that I stood on line for over 30 minutes and when I got inside... sure the bar and dance floor areas were crowded, but the back was pretty much open.   I don't know how much the drinks were because I'm not much of a drinker and I drove.. like to be responsible and not get myself into questionable situations. I met friends there, which was also frustrating since they got there early for dinner and stayed.. I couldn't find them for the longest and then they pretty much wanted to leave since they were smashed. We stayed about an hour or less after my friend found me. Lol I'm not sure how late the club is open or even if it's every Saturday or sporadic Saturdays. Just used my name!! :-)  The vibe inside is cool, music was on point and it's definitely dress to impress. I came after work and fit in fine. I would definitely return with friends but go together or pre-plan the meeting spot to kill frustrations. Lol"}
{"text":"Just tried this past week for the first time!   Amazing food and great prices! Loved the shrimp scampi with linguine. They make the sauce right in front of you. Everything is so fresh!   Love the basil and rosemary plants, olive oil and grinders on the tables. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place . alittle different but fun. kids enjoyed watching them make our food. great atmosphere good for family or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Been here on a Friday for lunch. Good place and staff. Ordered chicken pasta with Thai curry sauce it's not in the menu but they've made it upon request and it's so good."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were handed plastic cards (like hotel room keys) and told to go order what we wanted and after eating bring our cards and pay.  The drill is, go to bar, scan your card order what you want and repeat this at each station (soup, salad, entree).  Very easy once you get the hang of it,  and a very fast way to get food.  Once we got our food and went to the table both my husband and I were very surprised at how good it was. I had pumpkin soup followed by pumpkin ravioli in butter sauce (yes, I love pumpkin).  It was excellent!!!  My husband had pesto spinach ravioli with tomato sauce which was also excellent.   The pasta was cooked perfect and the sauces were very tasty.  We enjoyed the meal with a carafe of their red sangria.  The sangria was as good as the sangria we got in Spain earlier this year.  Would highly recommend this place for great pasta.  Note:  if you want a quiet intimate atmosphere this is not the place, but if you want an upbeat modern eatery do not hesitate to come here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! I have visited the other location in Chicago and I'm in love. After moving to Charlotte, I'm very excited that they have another location here. Vapiano is not a typical Italian restaurant where you can sit and are served, but you walk in and sit and the staffs will hand a contact chip card. I need to admit that the ordering process might be a little confusing if it is your first time. The thing is you go to different stations and order. They have pizzas, salads, pastas, and sandwiches. They've also got a full-service bar, beer on tap and bottled soda. Unfortunately, there are no waitstaff, you just got to get up and do it yourself.   The atmosphere is very relaxing and clean. Very cool place. High ceiling with good decor. Service was fast and the staffs were friendly. I ordered the basil pasta with linguini, yes it was spicy but pretty good. Pasta is a must try. I have had scampi which is great. You can select which kind of pasta and choose the level of spiciness. Pizza has a  very light crust and tastes good.  Highly recommend if you are looking for quick service, inexpensive prices, great atmosphere, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Another Italian restaurant. It's kinda self order place where you come up to a counter order and wait until the chef cooks it right in from of you. They have pizza salad and pasta. Had the pasta a few times it's not bad but not the best I've had. A bit pricey for what it is. But I'm cheap."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the scampi and spinach. Very solid pasta. You can watch them make it and have them spice it exactly to your preference. Solid."}
{"text":"A friend suggested Vapiano, and I was thrilled. Having never been, my 1st thought  upon arrival was what a great set-up, trendy and bright. The place was packed, so luckily I was with someone who had been and explained the layout. As one other yelper said it is comparable to food court, yet an upscale Italian food court. I chose the pizza/panini isle, still debating which one to go with. When I reached the counter, they suggested the pizza. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza and it was so good. Very large, definitely could have shared, but it had a great crust, fresh chicken and cheese, and the pesto was great!  My friend ordered the Greek salad, which she loved. I will say I saw a few pasta plates that looked great! I will be back.  One thing I will point out, it was packed during the 11:30-1:30 lunch hour which can be tight or difficult for someone trying to grab a nice/quick lunch.  I hope you all give it a try, a delight in uptown in my mind."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and dinner and it's a decent option.  The food is good and tastes fresh but the general service here leaves something to be desired. Seems like the staff is pre occurred with something else going on and not apt to take care of the ppl in front of them. Most had somewhat of an attitude and that's frustrating given all the other options around the area and the stellar customer service they offer. Prob won't be bac"}
{"text":"You can't help but want to try this place out... at least for me when I drove by a few weeks ago.  The vast open space in the middle of uptown Charlotte, a spanking new bar in front of an open window.  So yesterday I went to test this place out for a late casual lunch.  I heard of the European Self-Service system, but it's still a bit confusing.  The hostess could have done a better job explaining, that's after I asked them about it (what happened to \"have you been here before... let me explain how this work?\").  Luckily on a late Sunday afternoon this place was virtually empty, so I didn't feel as bad for my cluelessness.  Basically you are given a card, which you swipe (think key card kinda swipe) before you order so they can keep track of your tab.    We decided to split an Americana pizza.  I was interested in a side of soup, which sadly they didn't have any.  What's worse is when I asked the Pizza guy about soup, the response was something similar to \"I don't know, ask her.\"  When I asked \"her\" the salad lady, it took her quite a time to acknowledge my existance, only for her to tell me not only they didn't have soup, but because they didn't have the ingredients to make soup... interesting.  Speaking of missing ingredients.  When we ordered my sangria at the bar, the bartender didn't have the basil... but he was gladly going to look for some in the kitchen.  I told him to just give me the $4 house white, but he forgot to change the order on the tab.  Basically it was quite choatic for a late Sunday afternoon, I can't imagine what it would be like during lunch rush!  (FYI, Captain & Coke is $8.50)  Food was decent.  $9 pizza is big enough to share if no one is starving.  The pizza was definitely fresh, I wish there were more toppings.  I glanced through the pasta menu, and I am wanting to try it next time.    I can see why some people think it's not at all impressive, but I LOVE the space!  The red seating area by the bar, the clean simple lines of the furnitures, the openness, the high ceiling... all so causal yet chic.  For its location, I think this is a great affordable place to grab a quick bite and chit chat.    To sum it up, 2-star for service (very sad for a self-serve place), 3-star for food, 5-star for atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went to this place several times over the summer and each time it got better. I consistently had the pizza but my friends always ordered pasta and they gave rave reviews. The concept of this restaurant might be confusing at first but you get the hang of it quickly. I love the atmosphere and I'm excited to be working just down the street from it in a few short months.   This place was also really good with my allergies and I was able to watch them make my food from start to finish. It's a great place to customize what you want and easily add or remove stuff. You would be a fool to order a salad at vapiano because they make the pasta and pizza from scratch in front of your eyes.  If you are looking for a great quick Italian place in uptown, go here! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I *love* the Vapiano in Union Square, NYC.   It rocks.  The CLT Vapiano venue lacks the open air sidewalk feeling that makes the Union Square property so special.  The food is still quite good.  The European, self-service, cafeteria style is different and fun.  The staff could use a Red Bull or two to step up the energy level, but, maybe Sunday nights are just slow."}
{"text":"10:00 at night in Uptown and most of the restaurants are closed. We wanted someone inexpensive and easy, so as we walked past Vapiano and Yelped it, we decided to pop in.  Interesting concept I've not seen before. Sort of cafeteria style in that you go and get your own food, but it's cooked right in front of you to order. When you order, they scan your RFID card and then when you leave, they tally up from that what you had to eat and drink. I would imagine that this place is a crazy madhouse during the lunch rush, but late in the evening, it was pretty quiet and peaceful.  I let my wife hold down the table while I went and got two plates of pasta for us. Chicken alfredo and a meat-filled ravioli. As mentioned earlier, everything is made right to order and you can watch the guy mixing it up as he does it. You want more garlic, less tomatoes? Done.  Oh, and the pasta? Yeah, they make all of that on site too so it's really fresh and not dried out like the stuff you might get in the store.  It was excellent option for late dinner and we'll absolutely be back.  Tip: Try the olive oil for dipping your bread. They've put red pepper flakes in it for a nice little zing."}
{"text":"After you get over the beautiful layout, you will fine that it's not all that.of a good night out. If you are with friends, you go up to lines (Salad, Pizza or Pasta) individually to order. If you want a salad and pizza, then that's two lines. Your guests are in other lines unless you want the same food. This mean the only time you socialize is while you are in line waiting to place an order. Needless to say, all the food does no come ready at the same time. So you and your guests may not eat together. Oh, you want a drink, that's ANOTHER line. You get it, you spend a lot of money to wait in line. This is NOT the american way. People want to be served and have dinner and drinks TOGETHER with friends not in phases. For the price, it's not worth the poor type of service.   AND the workers want tips will you are doing the serving. Hmmm  What gives!!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of really awesome. We arrived right when they seemed to get busy for lunch but the place is huge so there is no need to worry about not getting a table. Upon entering, the host gave us a card and explained how the whole restaurant worked. You take your card up to the station you want (they are labeled) and order. From there, they scan your card and give you a little beeper to tell you when your food is ready. There are two bars, one at the front and one at the back where the same card concept applies. I ordered the bruschetta pizza and antipasti plate while the other people in my party ordered pasta carbonara and a chicken panini (can't remember exactly what kind). With your meal, they give you bread and there is oil and balsamic at the table. Overall, food was very good and I loved the atmosphere. The only issue I saw with the whole thing was that people could walk out without paying for their meal. I even asked the woman checking me out how they dealt with that and she didn't have an answer or solution to it yet. Definitely worth trying because it's pretty good Italian food that's fast!"}
{"text":"Solid all the way around. The food has always impressed me and it's a little of a cafeteria /self serve/made to order food style which is probably more European than anything else. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We've been around 5 times total and will come back."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant!  When I went there was no wait time and the staff was extremely friendly. The place is very spacious and has a variety of Italian dish options. The prices were reasonable and ranged from $2 espressos to $13 main dishes and pizza. The process is cool as well. The food is made to order and   customers are provided with cards to scan while they are ordering. After ordering, the customer must scan the card to transfer their order onto the card.  When finished, the customer must give the staff the card (which has the items ordered) and pay for their meal. This place was absolutely amazing and clean with great food."}
{"text":"My dinner tonight was less than wonderful. I ordered the risotto seasonal special. If it's a special, it should be great, but it may be my fault for thinking it would be made already. You can't make risotto in the Vapiano-style; it needs to cook for longer.   The only reason I actually listed it as 2-stars is because it is my second time. I love this place in NYC, but for some reason, the food isn't the same here in Charlotte. Overall, great vibe and layout for groups, if you go early enough."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone seems to be ragging on Vapiano, its tasty and quick. Maybe a little pricey for cafeteria style, but it's upscalish Italian cafeteria and I can't resist the chicken alfredo, the best cream sauce ever. I like to add a little pesto and chilis to the dish. The thai Italy is a good choice if you want to mix it up. Pasta comes with fresh bread (yum) that you can dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar which are provided at the tables. Don't miss out. The portions are pretty big as well, I have to split with my boyfriend. The best part, in house pasta! It's so fresh! You can see them rolling it out during the day.   I have also tried the pesto pizza which is also pretty good if you aren't feeling the pasta. I love the crunch with the thin crust pizza.   We have also tried the tiramisu which was sadly a disappointment. Olive gardens tiramisu unfortunately tastes better. Vapianos needs to pick up their dessert game.   Finally, who doesn't love gummy bears?! There is super fresh gummy bears at the hostess station where you grab your cards and check.   I'm hoping to try their brunch menu soon, the salmon crepes sound so good!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a 3.5 star. You go up to a person behind a counter with a sign indicating \"pizza,\" \"pasta,\" salad,\" etc and order the appropriate food. I went when it was empty late at night and ordered the pasta arrabiatta, which has tomato sauce, chilies, onions and garlic. I got penne noodles and a spice level 4 (out of 5). I love spicy foods and 4 was good for me, could've gone for five. Bf got pollo picante and liked it. I enjoyed mine but didn't love because I make a really awesome pasta arrabiatta at home... the noodles tasted freshly made.   You pick your noodles, selected from prepackaged noodles they say are handmade (seems like it!) I wish they'd say if they were wheat semolina or whatever kind they are, as I'm curious for nutritional purposes. You can observe the chef preparing and cooking the food. Or sit down and head over when they're ready.   I like this for a fast casual, yet more upscale and nicer ambience, Italian meal. The dining space has a nice touch, marble blocks on tables with stools. Some on the walls have back support. Dim lighting.   Before leaving, you take the card u get to scan what u order to the front and pay there. No waiters here."}
{"text":"Great set-up. Self serve restaurant with house made pasta and sauces.  Got the chicken alfredo, really good."}
{"text":"I wish yelp had a 0 !!! Cause this place would have got it! Walk in and had a friendly greeting and that was about it. Stood in line and waited to be assisted... the cook said 1 minute .... 10 minutes late after the cook finished a customers order both cooks skipped us and helped someone else! On the way out I mentioned to the host that we where leaving because we where ignored! She smiled and said oh ok! Have a nice day!  Never tried the food but the experience was terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Not your typical uptown restaurant.   You grab a magnetic card, go to the line where you want to order (salad, pizza, pasta), order, swipe, and sit until your buzzed.   There is no wait staff, but you can see the cooks at work through the glass counter, bussers clean after you.   Food is wonderful! This is also a great place to grab drink, ad they have a full bar with friendly staff.   Indoor and outdoor seating, with beautiful modern decor."}
{"text":"We take all of our guests to this restaurant I love everything I've gotten. From the pizza to the pasta it's all great and CHEAP! It's like a better form of noodles and company. Cafe style but still very nice and fun"}
{"text":"Was not impressed by the food & service for lunch today. Ordered a petit salad & the lady had me take a buzzer. I went to the next station to order my pasta & the gentleman making the food didn't acknowledge me for at least 5 minutes & there was only 1 other girl there waiting for her food. Buzzer rings for the salad & it's a huge salad, not the \"petit\" one I asked for. She gives me the large salad & quickly changed the price on my card, but the salad was drenched in salty balsamic dressing! Yuck! The gentleman brings my spaghetti out & it tastes like glue. All of the noodles are stuck together like it was thrown in a pot of water & forgotten about. At least the bread was good...."}
{"text":"The food and flavors have basic taste at Vapiano, nothing special. Presentation of the food was great and we received a good amt for the price. The noodles were not cooked well, they tasted gummy. A host of items on the menu, offering something for the whole family. The cooks didnt seem to friendly, very slow service. We visited on a thursday night, not busy at all. The shop is both clean and tidy, having plenty seating space, good parking on street after 7pm. Staff members greeted us when we can in/ out when we left. I would give this restaurant another chance in the future.   Vapiano was my favorite go to restaurant while livin in Gemany, we loved the food, never had any issues."}
{"text":"Amazing set up inside. It's a perfect place to be able to hang out with a few friends while you have a cocktail and delicious fresh prepared food. Great alcohol specials too!! It's a really fun feel!"}
{"text":"I like the concept. These cook to order places have really gained some traction. Watch everything made fresh to order with or without a smile. Pizza's decent, the pasta is fresh and they even grow their own herbs.   While the food surely isn't sit down quality, it does the job. Prices are a little bit high though, but hey I guess we're paying for the show."}
{"text":"This place is very good for lunch in Charlotte. I have only tried the pastas but the food is made fresh and is well priced. The wait can be long at times but there are a lot of lines. A good fast casual restaurant to try in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Considering this restaurant is located directly below my office, I've never partaken in a meal here until the other day.  Literally, I was a \"kid in a candy store\" and was amazed by their setup here.  Almost cafeteria-esq style, you walk in, get greeted by the hostess/greeter person and he/she will give you a plastic card.  Depending on what you would like to eat for that meal, you walk up to the counter and order.  Place your card on the \"magic\" slot device and the put the item you are about to receive on it and you pay the cashier on the way out.  Kinda genius if you think about it.  Less waiters (they still bus the tables for you) and the tables are first come-first serve.  I think my favorite part of this place is that they make their pasta in-house.  Even have a room dedicated to it.  During my lunch, I totally watched a guy make pasta from scratch and then put it through a machine.  Rotini was being made at that particular time.  I ordered from the pasta station and the chef?/line cook was super nice.  I think he could tell I was a newbie, and was patient with me.  Deciding on the Smoked Salmon Carbonera... the started making my lunch right in front of me.  In about 7-8 min... I had a delicious, steaming bowl of pasta presented before me.  My buddy had a salad which involved a beeper (so will have to try that next time).  And their pizza's look pretty awesome too.  The restaurant space itself is modern with clean lines, but warm woods and decorated with small herb plants.  Each table has its own oil, salt, pepper, balsamic.  I tried to take it easy on the bread, but it was too hard to resist."}
{"text":"They make the food in front of you. What more can I say? That's as fresh as it gets. My favorite thing to do is concocting different sauces and dressings using the fresh herbs growing all around the restaurant and the olive oil at the table. Make a Greek olive oil herb infused dressing for your bread at the dining table, that's awesome! Prices not so bad considering that it's smack dab uptown."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great setting and the energy is right. The thing I didn't like was the fact that my Alfredo did not have enough sauce and my boyfriend's pizza was cold. The first time we went it was great, the second time it was terrible. So I guess it is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment while visiting Charlotte. I loved how there is so much space. The cooks were friendly and willing to assist a newbie. The tables were clean and stocked with plants that bring a refreshing look to patrons. Portions were average but tasted very good. To me, it is more of an upscale cafeteria. I would go back again! I just wish they would expand to the mid-atlantic and northeast regions."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and friend on a Sunday night. It was very busy at all so we decided on pasta. My boyfriend and friend got chicken Alfredo and I got bolognese with Italian sausage. My bolognese was very good but their Alfredo was so bad they sent it back and got bolognese instead. After making the Alfredo, taking it back and getting the bolognese(which probably equaled out to about 45 min) they still did not receive their caesar side salads. Or bread. Food received 3-4 stars but service is at a 2-3 stars."}
{"text":"We were not Vapiano Virgins when drawn in by the Breakfast menu out front on a recent Sunday morning. Having enjoyed the one in DC for dinner in the past, and more recently a stop at this Charlotte one on a food tour for a drink and dessert, we already had fond memories of Vapiano.  (me more-so than Husband, as he still debates the \"cafeteria\" style).  Anyway, Sunday morning in Uptown staying at the nearby Omni, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  (There was one other couple who seemed very happy with their breakfast).  TIP: Get the breakfast pizza!  There are a few to choose from. Husband got one with bacon and sausage and it was way bigger and way yummier than he expected.  Had we known, we would have shared it.  (I still stole bites of his).  My Italian \"Crepe\" was way heavier than I expected. It was quite thick and hearty.  Turkey and Spinach in it were good...tomatoes, not overly fresh as it's off-season for them.  I found myself digging out the insides to eat and leaving the heavy \"crepe\" to be sadly discarded.  (hate wasting food!)  They obviously (wisely) use down-times to do prep work, so staff-wise, they weren't prepared at all for actual guests.  Fortunately we weren't in any hurry."}
{"text":"I have been here thrice now and I like the concept, but it's not very Convenient if you want any kind of customization or try to ask even a question.  The chefs/cooks are extremely busy as this place gets crowded. It's almost a guarantee that your order will be screwed up even if u have a minor change.    Tonight I ordered the beef n shrimp salad and asked what grilled vegetables they put in it..all I said was to leave the Eggplants off. Sure enough there were tons of eggplants in it.   Stick to pizza or don't try any kind of customization if you end up at this place."}
{"text":"Top score in my book. Excellent pasta or pizza, unique concept, great seating and a hip and young scene. Very affordable. Did the place three days in a row."}
