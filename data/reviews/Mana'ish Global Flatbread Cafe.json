{"text":"YES.  (*this was exactly the thought process that occurred as I bit into my classic zaatar manaish) 

The zaatar is heavily sprinkled on top of the flatbread (which you have an option of wholewheat or white).  There was also olives and mint leaves as a filling too.  Despite having to wait around 5 minutes, the flatbread is delivered to you HOT and nicely rolled up like a wrap so you can eat without making a mess.  

They have pretty good lunch deals which include coffee/ tea + salad + classic zaatar or their special flatbread combos which incorporate more international flavours which are all under 10$.  (FYI my classic zataar- cost 3.50 without tax so i recommend going for the lunch combo instead) 

As I am typing this review- reminiscing how good it was is making me seriously debate on going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the Classic Za'atar, Levantine Cheese and the  Lamb & Beef Levantine with Mint Tea it was really great .

Also we have been served a complimentary dessert which had amazing taste! 

I truly recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"OVERALL
Finally, something different! (and good)

AMBIANCE
Very different look than the average GTA restaurant.  White and blue mosaic tiles and the flatbreads come out of a hearth from the kitchen.  Lots of windows, so nice and bright at lunch.

I wouldn't really recommend it for very young children because flavours are too sophisticated, but there are enough options for a wide range of tastes.  It's not a Happy Meal, colouring book sort of place, but well behaved kids would do fine there.

SEATING/GROUPS
Big enough dining room with 3 distinct seating areas if more private or quiet dining desired.
Thankfully not as crammed like Starbucks across the street.  

Could probably push individual tables together to seat 2 tables of 8 if necessary. Maybe 25 seats there total.

FOOD
Feels like a fresh, modern cafe with pretty chocolate-dipped baklava, French desserts, fancy bottled beverages, to-go salads, coffee, espresso, and tea.  Does not seem to serve alcohol.

Main attraction seems to be Mana'ish flatbreads, which are like baked-to-order, delicate, rolled up, small pizzas.  They top it with fresh veggies, herbs, olives, and sauces depending on the selection --- so there can be hot and cold fillings, which is probably a good thing for cucumber and smoked salmon.  There were tons of flatbread topping options: some middle-eastern like Zaatar (thyme/sesame) and lamb, but many with flavour themes from almost every continent (obvi not Antarctica).  

REALLY enjoyed the Jerk Chicken and Chimichurri Beef followed by the cinnamon caramel flatbread.  I've always been disappointed by pizzeria desserts, so that was a pleasant surprise that makes me want to try their other dessert flatbreads.

PRICES
About $4-5 per flatbread (a few cost less).  Probably need to eat 2 for a meal.  Pretty decent prices for downtown and not being a burger.  Mostly I like that I can grab a more healthy, affordable snack right after working out.

SERVICE
Staff are nice, but allow 10-15 min for your flatbread to bake (worth the wait for something fresh I'd say).

LOCATION, PARKING, DRIVING
Despite the Spadina Ave address, the entrance is actually 3 doors west on south side of Richmond St W.  One-way, west-bound traffic on Richmond only.  It's below Yoga Tree.

Paid parking lot couple doors west, across the street.
Street parking is a bit challenging that block, but nice that there's almost always curb space to drop off passengers right at the door from the driver's side (one-way street).

Spadina or Queen St street cars are likely most convenient options.

ACCESSIBILITY
2 unisex washrooms are on ground level; the fully wheel chair accessible washroom is nice and large for the disabled or parents trying to corral kids/strollers.

Mixed seating: window-side bar stools, few tables with a combination bench/pull out chairs with backs, but mostly tables for parties of 2 with pull out chairs.  No arms on chairs/stools.
Double-door entrance is large enough for a wheel chair plus has handicap door buttons."}
{"text":"Good food, not  commercial, friendly staff. Nice hideaway if your in the area and need a break for a few minutes."}
{"text":"This place is always empty and after trying it I found out why. It's only been there for a month or 2 and I can't see it lasting much longer.  Not bad tasting but not much to it. Jerk chicken didn't taste like jerk chicken. Way too much yogurt on my way too little butter chicken = tasted like a yogurt wrap.  Decor too sterile. Zero personality. Goodnight sweet prince."}
{"text":"Sampled three items: Zaatar man'oosh, cheese man'oosh and a tabouleh quinoa salad. The zaatar was too salty, the jebneh was a bit rich and the tabouleh was fine. The food I sampled was ok, but for me it was lacking that \"oomph\" that makes it stand out and be remembered. Its nothing special really. Staff was nice and friendly.

As for the rest of the place I have one main complaint: the menu is too confused. The place advertises itself as a Flatbread/Man'oushe place, however for some reason there is Korean food on the menu? I understand if it wants to have a global theme and cater to different cuisines, but me thinks it should stick to mana'eesh and focus on perfecting them. The portions are too small and a bit pricey for what you get in return (but hey thats Toronto for you, their rent and property tax must be through the roof). 

Oh and a paramount opened up right across the street from them. Tough luck!"}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch with my wife. All I have to say is mmmm so delicious. The flatbreads are something we have never tried before so much flavor. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is a delight.

They make fresh flatbed, that you eat as a pizza/roll/taco. They have a number of options and everything was under $8. But be warned, if you intend to feel full you may need to order more than one item. 

The docor is like a lot of cafes in Toronto, clean, minimalist, cool/retro lighting. 

The server was polite.

They do not have enough space for large groups, a good lunch or early dinner place."}
{"text":"This place is a breathe of fresh air next to all these tourist trap restaurants on spadina, king, and queen. Place was clean and everything comes hot. Everything is so reasonably priced - nothing over $5. 

Food is amazing!

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got a flatbread which came with a small salad! The flatbread was fresh out of the oven and the toppings were well thought out. I would definitely come back for more! There was also lots of good coffee options which would be interesting to try."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic middle eastern concepts in Toronto. Mana'ish is ran by a very dedicated and hard working family with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean background. 

The restaurant is spotless, clean, and beautiful designed with an elegant and trendy color scheme and tile decorations, reminiscent from the Middle East/Levant region. 

The food is fantastic, high quality ingredients, and well priced. It's the right combination between comfort food but healthy at the same time. I tried the Chimichurri Beef manaeesh for breakfast (with extra eggs on it) and one of the best americanos that one can find around. Next time I'll have the authentic Lebanese coffee. 

Try this place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They also carry baklava (middle eastern sweet pastries), and some funky bottled drinks from all around the world (Jarritos from Mexico - yay!)"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and we shared 4 flatbreads altogether; the classic (2), classic with akawi (1), and the cinnamon pecan caramel dessert (1). 

The prices are very reasonable for the portions they give (especially if you bulk out on all the free toppings). 

The flavours were amazing and I'm gonna definitely try different flatbreads when we come here again. 

The service was much better than expected, I thought we had to pick up our food from the counters as we saw others do it, but apparently if you dine in they'll bring your food to you and clear your plates too! I kinda feel bad for not tipping now haha but everyone here was friendly, and when we had a lot of questions (friend has a TON of allergies) they were patient and kind. 

Would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, hot and fresh. Satisfied my craving this afternoon for something along the lines of shawarma but not exactly sure what I was looking for. This place hit the spot. The flat breads are amazing - I had the beef and lamb and the Levantine cheese. Good little portions if you want to taste a variety. They also have a few meal combos which will allow you to explore the menu. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly empty, only 2 other patrons. But the space was bright, clean, spacious and welcoming. The staff at the counter was nice and personal. 

I got the smoked salmon with cucumber, dill and labneh . It was simple and fresh. The bread was warm and perfectly chewy. For a quick lunch in the area its a great cost, below $6 for everything on the menu, however if you are hungry you may need two."}
{"text":"Finally Toronto has a real authentic levantine mana'ish shop. We tried it yesterday for the first time and we are back today again. 
The zaatar manshooshi is the real deal, and the cherry on the cake are the veggies that they put in. 
We had as well the cheese which is oh so good. The addition of parsley and herbs to the authentic akkawi cheese elevates the taste to another level.
And an absolute must is the meat man'oushi. So tender and light and the addition of labneh  (Greek yogurt) to it gives it a tanginess hmmmm.
We also tried the goat and zucchini man'oushi...simply scrumptious.
We are soo looking forward to trying your other varieties. You've got yourselves here some returning customers."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim because I spotted the beautiful display of baklava in the window, and only crazy people ignore baklava. Their desserts are delicious, especially the small walnut and pistachio baklava squares and the kourabiedes (almond cookies with icing sugar on the outside). Reasonable prices. The woman who works there is so friendly and welcoming, which added to the charm of this Lebanese cafe. They also deliver, in case you're craving baklava right now but you're too lazy to walk there :)"}
{"text":"I ordered here with mealpal. I got chicken with salad. The food taste great. The service is outstanding. I would definitely come back to try out other meal off the menu."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday morning, it was pretty quiet with only a few people which is exactly what my wife & I like. Food was delicious! Portions were a bit small but then you realize it's under $5 per man'ousheh and it's pretty reasonable. We tried the Salmon & Labneh, Zaatar, Classic Cheese, and Butter Chicken. Considering my Lebanese background, I was surprised at how the unconventional Salmon & Labneh was my favorite (and also my wife's), and butter chicken was least favorite. 

Service was quick and friendly, can't complain. 

Only minus is the cheesy 80s jazzy elevator music playing for 'ambiance' . Didn't ruin the experience by any means, but I felt it was worth mentioning. 

We will come back, I think it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"Super affordable and friendly. It's a great place to grab an afternoon snack of a salad or cut up veggies and dip.

It would be nice if they had some gluten free options for the flat breads but it's a hit for the offices in the area.

It's typically not busy so I do hope they stay open!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch/snacks: fast service, smaller portions, inexpensive (only $2.95 for classic) and healthy. My favorites are the classic and cheese but I hear the lamb & beef is really good. Definitely tastes best hot! The dessert is incredible, actually melted chocolate and not just nutella- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing middle eastern flatbread! Love the international spin and the healthy choices"}
{"text":"The unique flatbreads were delightful and reasonably priced. The customer service was excellent! Will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"The flat bread here is delicious! I really enjoyed the honey-miso chicken, lamb & beef, and Brie & Quince Mana'ish. The flavors are unique, fresh, and sublime. The rose lemonade was a fresh treat to go with my lunch today and I enjoyed the hand made baklava dipped in chocolate and pistachio. 

A great new addition to the Toronto food scene!!"}
{"text":"Wow Lebanese food which is not bland--sign me up!

All items are generously price and portions are on the petite side- was happy to see halal lamb and beef on the menus so I ordered the lamb and beef Mana'ish @ 5.75--it came rolled up in an Indian paratha, had just the right amount of meat, cream cheese, veggies, and flavour--added an almond cookie on the side $1.45 on the side which came loaded with powdered sugar--do not order this item if you're wearing All Black.

Felt amazing after eating something middle eastern and not holding my belly with both hands as I walked home.

This place gets 3 stars for making an attempt at Lebanese food."}
{"text":"I have just discovered my new FAVOURITE DESSERT in the entertainment district! It's their Mana'ish flatbread with melted brie and tangy quince jam -- and a steal at a mere $3.60. Oh my God, I can just picture getting on my bike regularly next summer just to taste this rich, buttery, sweet wrap.

Their mains are also delicious. Global Mana'ish serves picture-perfect flatbreads with international toppings. Today, I tried the ground lamb+beef with cucumber, lebneh yogurt, parsley and herbs; and the \"Greco\" pulled pork with feta, tomatoes, scallions and tzatziki. Since they're one of the few counter-service places to feature fresh mint (on the classic Za'atar), I asked for mint on my lamb+beef wrap -- clearly a winning combination. The Greco was amazing: Greek wraps, though delicious, typically have a harsh taste from the raw onion and industrial pork cubes; by using scallions and slow-cooked pork, GM's version tastes smooth as an Isaac Hayes groove, the ingredients in perfect harmony. 

Others have reported a low toppings-to-flatbread ratio. I found their wraps totally satisfying, so YMMV.

Next on my list: the simple spinach & cheese and the smoked salmon. Suffice it to say that I'll be making my way down the entire menu. (I just got a tip from the co-owner: I should ask for the smoked salmon on the classic Za'atar instead of the menu's dill base.)

If it was located in my neighbourhood, I'd come here every week. With everything under $5 and offering such great taste sensations, I'm sure Global Mana'ish will be a hit."}
{"text":"The customer service here is fabulous! As soon as you go in, you're greeted and told about the business. I love all of the recommendations the staff gave me. The mint tea is sooooo delicious especially with the super soft shortbread cookies! My favourite item from their menu is the Za'atar bites that come with the fresh Labneh.
I've tried the Caribbean Jerk Chicken but it was too spicy for me personally. The Greco Chicken Mana'ish is delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time yesterday afternoon and it was so good that I went back later in the day with a friend. Absolutely delicious casual spot with a huge variety of options and all very reasonably priced. My friend loved their coffee as well! Highly recommend. Walk past all the chain options and go to Mana'ish... you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I dropped by for lunch for the first time this week. This place specializes in middle-eastern flatbread rolled up with various toppings. I tried the Levantine cheese. The flatbread was crisped up on the edges, and the cheese was all bubbled up and melted. It was salty as hell but that's how I like it.

The service was super-friendly, and the meal was cheap; under $5! Hard to beat the value. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the classic plus goat cheese and pesto flatbread. It came with a small salad (there are three choices).. I got the kale and pecan one which was suprisingly good. It looked really plain but the dressing was interesting.. slightly sweet/citrusy. The flatbread was a decent portion and was super tasty. It was nice and warm and crispy, perfect with the goat cheese and pesto inside. Also came with a baklava, which was really flaky and yummy.. perfect to end the meal off with. The place is bright and clean which is always a plus. Would definitely recommend/come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Classic Zatar through the Feedback App. They prepared it fresh when I arrived, and I was able to substitute cucumbers for tomatoes (I'm intolerant to tomatoes). The staff is really nice and even drew a happy face on my paper bag!"}
