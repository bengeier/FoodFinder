{"text":"This place used to be decent before the new management. 
The food in buffet setting was not warm and everything tasted below par. By the time nan arrived already not so warm food was cold by then. 
I used to go their quite often but not any more. 

P.S. I had horrible time in the toilet next morning."}
{"text":"Found a baby roach in the bathroom. Food is cheap. They may be understaffed because Thali dishes looked like they were over the garbage for a while. I haven't been in 5 years, it has gone downhill since"}
{"text":"Great Indian budget food . 
If u r missing Indian food come to this place , try their combo for 3.99 .
They tandoori breads are outstanding ."}
{"text":"Hopeless food!  I fell sick in my stomach whole eating itself.  Ordered a non veg thali. At 5 bucks it's really cheap.  But by the end of the meal,  I feel like I should have been paid 5 bucks.  I couldn't go through with it."}
{"text":"If we're talking about pricing, you get a lot for what you pay for.  But the food being so cheap makes me wonder if that is a reflection of its quality (don't be upping the price now).  Food tastes great, but if you ask me which Indian restaurant I would recommend, it probably won't be this.  Nevertheless, I have a soft spot for this restaurant.  And that buffet price is unbeatable."}
