{"text":"If i could have one last burger for the the rest of my Life  it would definetly be this one . Best sauce eva ! I love it!!! Yahtzee!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and dogs with a great secret sauce!!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. I think if you grew up with this place then yu might like the food... Otherwise... you wont like it. Far better burger places around..."}
{"text":"Now I've passed by Dic Ann's on my way to work every week and I've never felt compelled to stop in, one, I really don't like the name, it does not speak to me! In all my poutine eating  years, this one tops the list as my worst ever.  I was at UPS picking up at package and I was hungry, I had been craving a poutine for a looong time and although I have my favorite spots, I thought how bad can it be?  I even asked the UPS guy and he told me it was not your typical poutine but of course I went anyway...  Dic Ann's is a small, clean little casse croute that sells hamburger, hotdogs etc.. Apparently known for their hamburgers but I will not be going back to find out.  In their defense, I sort of knew I would not like it because the picture display showed fries with grated cheese, a poutine without fromage en grain is not a really poutine!  So I placed my order and took away my cardboard box to my car and dove in.  Thin, ok fries, lots of grated cheese on top but the \"sauce\" dare I call it that, was thin, watery, oily, with bits of dehydrated like flecks of meat and specks of chili flavoring! I took my fork and dug around to the bottom, more of that thin, oily, watery brown liquid.   Out the window it all went and onto the highway I went!!  Truly the most disgusting poutine I've ever eaten and a waste of calories!"}
{"text":"I don't get it either. And that poutine! Worst poutine ever! Rubbery grated mozerella with some of the meat from the sauce on top and the fries bathing inwhat only can be described as brown hot dog water.  No no no no no.... Never again."}
{"text":"Not just a burger a Dic Ann burger. If you want a out of this world burger  you have to try it to believe it."}
{"text":"It's a classic. You gotta eat there! Dic anns is my go to for good burgers! I've been going to that location for the last 20years and it is still as authentic as the first time I went there. I would recommend the cheeseburger, got for the fries, not the poutine. Their sauce is great in the burgers but not in the poutine. Keep on doin these awesome burgers! I've eaten in several Dic Anns locations and quality is usually on par."}
{"text":"This place is as known as Schwartz's in Montreal. There is many locations now, and they just have the best thin burgers served with a lightly spicy sauce. There's nothing like it! I would recommend you try the basic 1 party cheeseburger or hamburger, all-dressed. And if you dare... ask for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"The food at all the dic Ann's is amazing. But the prices keep going up and up. It used to be a very affordable bargain to eat at these places; now that little secret place I used to go to is a lot more pricey. Still excellent, just will have to go less then before. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Simply over priced coasters on a greasy bun. I'll just head over to A&W down the street, this was not a good idea. Best thing was the soda."}
{"text":"Another over rated alleged Montreal institution. It's been around since the advent of fast food. They have a special sauce which they apply on super thin patties and hotdogs. I've been to three of their locations in the past 25 years and despite the excellent, curtious, and clean service which is consistent through out all of their locations, their product is expensive and unappetizing. The fries are terrible thin and boring and overall it's simply not worth it. Every time I've been there I've had 5 cheese burgers with a fry finding myself eating again two hours later.  Go once so you can say you've been there otherwise Don't  bother."}
{"text":"Still good, but still expensive if you have an appetite. Maybe I need to be on a diet, since I need 2 burgers and a frites-sauce to be full."}
{"text":"Loses a star because of the location, but this is a swell burger, in a retro-vintage back to the eighties kind of way.  The menu is very limited, burgers with 3-variations, and a hot-dog.  No chicken, no dessert, one size of drink.  There's not much better in this part of Laval"}
{"text":"Tellement bon! Pas beaucoup de places, mais commandes rapides et facile pour emporter! Différent des hamburgers réguliers...et fréquenté par pleins de stars du Québec...allez-y!"}
{"text":"I took the cheese hotdog and its pretty different :) it costs 3 dollars and it is a thin bread with melted cheese, spiced onions and sausage cut in half. Pretty good taste!  I also tried the cheese burger. It has mild taste of spice kind of similar to chili hotdog if you guys have ever tried. The bread is also thin and apparently its made of 100% beef. Very good too.  The best so far is the frite sauce. Its basically crispy fries with spicy chili beef sauce. God like :)"}
{"text":"3/14/15- When in Montreal, you gotta have one of these hamburgers. They were very thin, nothing like what I've had before. I'm a fan of the bread they use. Not a fan of hot sauce but this was different. My friend told me to get a tiny wooden stick they had at the counter, I didn't understand. Apparently you use it to pick up the burger, pretty cool. Poutine and coke!, now that was yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Manger là est un rituel à vivre absolument. L'endroit reste inchangé depuis toujours et c'est tant mieux. C'est Dic Ann's sur Pie-Ix, on se retrouve dans les années 60 et 70. L'endroit est un comptoir avec quelques tabourets, il faut attendre s'il n'y a pas de place ou sinon prendre pour emporter. Le must, c'est les burgers. Ils sont plats, avec une sauce piquante à la recette secrète et ils se prennent avec un bâton de popsicle dans une petite assiette en carton. Vous pouvez essayer le reste, mais on va chez Dic Ann's d'abord pour les burgers."}
{"text":"Not sure  I get this place, they make burgers flat like grilled cheese and add some kind of gravy meaty sauce which coud be good in theory but they want to sell it for 2$ so not much quality there but you have value for what you pay. Sure it gives you a retro experience of what fast food was like 40 years ago but not really in a fun way and I don't think the staff is very friendly and helful based on multiple visits"}
{"text":"Un cadre moins honnête que les succursales davantages établis. La qualité intangible de celui-ci est précipitée par des traits trop actuels. Le folklore désuet du mobilier des premiers restaurants nous engage dans une ère passé, presque charmant. Mais bon. Le menu est circonscrit en somme aux hamburgers. Ceux-ci sont assujettis à une sauce épicée et les galettes de boeufs sont écrapouties très minces. Le tout en bouche presse à en commander plus qu'un tellemnt que le ratio nous est défavorable. Mais c'est ce qui fait l'attribut essentiel de Dic Ann's."}
{"text":"1st time I went to Dic Annes restaurant. I found that the hamburgers & buns are really really thin; no photoshop tricks here. The taste of the burger was good, not great but the sauce was really good. It was spicy but not to the point that I had to drink a litre of water. I was disappointed with the French fries, too think and not crispy.  Overall I may or may not go back, it will depend on if I have coupons or not."}
{"text":"What can you say about this old hamburger joint.  They use to have an add that said \"Hamburger's so thin you can slide them under a door!\"  well its true.  but that doesnt take away from the great taste.  The flatten burgers with great sauce, they even give you a popsicle stick so you can scoop up the extra sauce.... its a must every couple of weeks!"}
{"text":"I ordered the double cheeseburger.    It was pretty tasty.    What makes this only a 3 star review was the service.   We were visiting from California and it probably doesn't surprise anyone that we don't speak French.   The server insisted on speaking to us in French and we could barely understand a word.    Her body language spoke volumes though.   She was obviously didn't want to attempt to communicate with us in any way.   She maintained a gruff look on her face and an offensive posture.   No help at all."}
{"text":"Ok, what am I not getting here?  Someone took me to this place for lunch yesterday, raving about it and shocked that in the year I have lived here I have not eaten at a Dic Ann's.    At first I wasn't even going to give it a rating because it would be 1 or 2 stars tops and I didn't want to pull it down from all the lovers of Dic Ann's....so maybe it is me?  I had a double burger and poutine.  I am not usually a fast food guy, but I find the poutine at Harvey's to be way better!  And for that matter the burgers as well.  I liked their sauce though.  I also liked the originality of the way they serve the flat burgers with squished down buns soaked in the sauce.  Nice work.  It just didn't do it for me though.  And old school, cash only!  Who carries cash?  Maybe it's an acquired taste!  I'll give it another shot in a few Months when I have a fast food craving again!"}
{"text":"Worst \"burger\" joint i ever been too. Perhaps it might be what i ordered but i felt very ripped off by eating a flat burger with a small portion of skinny fries. The taste was stale and the presentation was sloppy to say the least. I would never go back and i would not be surprised to see the chain shutdown."}
{"text":"Aller manger un hamburger et des frites chez Dic Ann's vous transportera magiquement dans les années 1950. En effet, ce mythique restaurant du boulevard Pie-IX a de toute évidence très peu changé depuis son ouverture en 1954. Si ce dernier a fait des petits, et constitue aujourd'hui une petite chaîne locale, le Dic Ann's de la rue Pie-IX est l'original. Malgré sa popularité, le restaurant a fait le pari de l'authenticité et aucun agrandissement n'y a été effectué. On mange à même le comptoir, car il n'y a pas de tables, et encore faut-il qu'il y ait une place de disponible audit comptoir...   Ce fast-food offre pas de trio et le menu est plutôt limité : il se limite à des frites et des hamburgers, dont il n'existe qu'une version. Et si vous avez une grande faim, vous n'avez qu'à commander plusieurs de leurs délicieux hamburgers ! Leurs hamburgers valent à eux seuls le détour. Très fins, ils sont composés d'une viande fine et d'un pain très mince, qui est une sorte de petite crêpe dont je n'ai malheureusement pas percé le secret. Aussi, l'originalité des hamburgers tient de la sauce piquante qu'on y met et dont la recette est un autre secret de Dic Ann's."}
{"text":"A real Montreal institution !  My parents lived nearby so I would stumble in on occasion and still stop by since I moved out. Dropped in this past Friday for 2 cheeseburgers with that special sauce!  Take away also available!"}
{"text":"Un classique de la culture alimentaire montréalaise. Spécialité Burger plat sauce à spaghetti épicée. Mon père m'y amenait il y a plus de 30 ans et ça n'a pas changé."}
{"text":"Dic Ann's was an acquired taste for me. I didn't really think much about it the first time I went, but since I'm associated with other people that love this place, I've found myself back at this joint and enjoying it more and more each time.  The first time I went, I went with a basic hamburger. Like four basic hamburgers (they're not that filling, I swear!). It had a unique sauce (with a kick!) and pretty good meat patty. The bun is squished down to the width of a pancake and then held together with a toothpick.   The hi-boys, as they call it, is a patty with cheese, tomato and lettuce. These are actually much better than the plain burger and is much more filling (I only need three!).   All in all, this is a unique burger. I don't hold it in as high regard as others do, but nevertheless it's good stuff. Inexpensive too."}
{"text":"This is a classic Montreal burger joint that has a pretty original super thin burger, so they can sling them out at the speed of hunger. Top it off with a spicy tomato sauce with raw onions that you need a coffee stick the lift from the plate and you got some awesome burgers. Plus fries fried in peanut oil, a life changer. This place is a love it or hate it place. I love it."}
{"text":"I like going to Dic Ann's once a year to get their flat spicy burgers. It's an acquired taste that I tend to enjoy but don't love. I stick with the cheese hi-boys, which consists of a gaunt patty with spicy homemade sauce, two flat buns (which one is soggy due to the sauce), cheese, 1 tomato slice and some lettuce. I like their fries as well.  It's inexpensive and worthy of a try. It's not for everyone though."}
{"text":"Mea Culpa, il faut que j'en parle,  Lors de mes voyages un peu partout en province, plusieurs fois j'ai été ''obligé'' de manger du fastfood. Je n'en suis pas particulièrement fier mais il faut ce qu'il faut !  On se lasse facilement de toutes les méga compagnies que vous connaissez tous.  Depuis peu, je travail à Laval et lors d'un midi serré j'ai essayé ce restaurant à l'enseigne un peu vétuste. C'est à ce moment que j'ai compris que lorsque l'on a une recette gagnante, pourquoi nécessairement là changer.  Le menu est simple et direct. Il cri : prend ce que l'on fait de mieux, mange le  et apprécie ! Je prends alors la suggestion de la serveuse, le burger fromage Dic Ann's avec la sauce Dic Ann's. Je prend ma commande et m'assoit dans ce décor brun et jaune n'ayant pas changé depuis les années 70 (ou astucieusement voulu ainsi).  Le goût de ce burger est incroyable ! la qualité de la viande également et le pain nous change de tout ce que la compétition peut offrir !   J'y suis retourné souvent ensuite, mea culpa !"}
{"text":"Amazing and unique burgers!  I usual go to the in Ville D'Anjou near autoroute 25."}
{"text":"A Montreal icon! Those famous, amazing, thin burgers! When u want some real junk food to hit the spot this is it! No point in ordering just one cause u will end up ordering another two! Just save yourself the time and order 4-5 burgers like I do lol fries are good (fried in peanut oil) but I don't order em to save space for the burgers! That's what it's all about!"}
{"text":"An institution. A legend even. The Pie IX location is the original Dic Ann's--it's also the home of one of North America's most original burgers.  The house special is an ultra-flat patty that's adorned only with their secret sauce, and served between an ultra-thin, smashed bun.  This is a burger that was built for speed and Dic Ann's has set land speed records for burgers.  The premises haven't changed much since the '50s. Neither have their prices. It doesn't get much more old-school than this and, personally, I wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"text":"Dic Ann's a good cheap place to grab a burger and fries but definitely overrated. The burger was pretty good and unique looking. The fries were good too but nothing exceptional. SKIP THE POUTINE.DONT GIVE IT A CHANCE, IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY! It was so dry on top and soggy on the bottom. It had weird cheese and sauce in it.  Cute place definetely but packed so you can take-out"}
{"text":"My favourite burger spot. Been coming here with my dad since I was just a kid. It nice to see the same staff after all these years."}
{"text":"Le meilleur dic ann's. La sauce toujours bonne, Bon petit hamburger et poutine, un délice"}
