{"text":"Came here the other day and this little restaurant/takeout place is amazing for super spicy duck snacks !!

It's really good if you want to grab a quick snack and don't mind using your hands to eat !!

I ordered myself some spicy duck leg/wing and pork hock(not sure if it is called that) It was super spicy even though i asked for less spicy, it felt like my lips were about to fall off if i didn't drink something cold right away...but what makes me love this is that the flavor is so good and blends in with the meat really well. 


overall i paid aprox. $5.00 for  3 pork hocks (i think that's what it called)  and 2 duck/leg wings.

I will be back for more snacks :)!"}
{"text":"It's time to mutate more tongues on ducks. I can wipe out a dozen of them in a dozen minutes if I'm pacing myself.  The flavour slightly outperforms a handful of other Chinese Duck specialty shops and you can see it in the colour of the marinade.  *3.5*

For a spicy-hot version, they'll ask if you want hot chili oil mixed into it and I highly doubt anyone wants it without.  It takes awhile for the mala spice to activate but once there you'll keep on snacking.

The shop much like others have various other duck parts available; head, neck, wings.  The wings definitely had enough time in the herb, spice marinade.  After all the exposure to duck parts the last few years, I think this is as good as it gets here in GTA.

Outside Canada, now that's another story..."}
{"text":"Another takeout place selling duck parts as snack food?

Should I be excited? How difference is Wuhan Hei Ya from the other place Kung Fu Duck?

The secret might be in the spice, herbs and marinade. Initial sweetness follows with numbing spiciness. Once you starts eating, there will be no stopping.... till everything is gone!

Duck wings for $1 might now be one of my favourite beer snack. I have yet to try the tongue (15 for $6) as it was sold out when I got there!
