{"text":"I'm late to the Hot Beans praising party, but not late in trying out their delicious tacos and donuts. Taking a bite out of one of their fresh lime coconut donuts makes me want to write poetry, but it looks like another reviewer has taken care of that.  So what can I say, I haven't eaten anything here I didn't like. The tacos are all delicious (though my favourite is the Yuba), and an order of nachos is filling and flavourful with spiced beans, cashew cream cheese, some kind of cheese sauce and veggies. I've been eyeing those burritos, but haven't gotten around to ordering one yet.  I'm happy to see a couple of different hot sauces on the side bench, along with a help yourself collection of water jugs. You might notice the lack of garbage can, well, everything is biodegradable. Which is awesome, but I can't help but be compelled to bring along a reusable container with me so I don't waste any more paper bags on donuts I inhale in 5 minutes anyway.  The limeade can be a bit too heavy on the agave sometimes, but otherwise I have no serious complaints. Service depends on the day and who's at the counter, but it's usually somewhere between decent and awesome.  The seating is limited to about 9-12 people depending on where you're sitting, but it hasn't felt crowded any of the (several several several) times I've gone in. There is a lot of foot traffic, people running in and out to grab a quick bite.   The simplicity of their menu and pricing scheme is appreciated, just enough choice, without too much choice. What you see on the board, is what you will pay (tax is included), and combining donuts and tacos or beverages results in a nice round number which nutty folks like me will appreciate.  I haven't checked them out for breakfast on the weekends, but it's definitely on my to do list. Breakfast burritos... tempting, tempting.  Seriously, vegan or otherwise, at the very least pick up a donut, you wont regret it, really, go. Eat."}
{"text":"Jackfruit Tacos with rice and black beans was very tasty although a bit sweet for my liking (although this seems to be a regular issue with BBQ sauces lately). My accomplice had the Seitan Burrito which was excellent and substantial in quantity. Great to have innovative veggie food like this around."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I hold my breath  anticipating that there will be a line out the door! (Note: this hasn't happened yet. But it should!). This place is, to put it mildly, fantastic! Tacos and burritos are one of those dime a dozen foods for me. But for Hot Beans, yeah, I would pay at least 2 dimes. It's such a unique (vegan) take on the classic Mexican dish.  The burritos are huge! The first time I went there I was a little bummed that my burrito didn't come with a side. This feeling soon dissipated when I realized I would have leftovers of my burrito for the next day! However, let me also recommend the tacos but mostly for the nacho and salsa side. So fresh, so lovely! Whichever way you go, try the TVP. I've never taken the time to figure out what TVP is, but it is delicious and oddly meaty. Either way, if you're in the area- try this place out!"}
{"text":"I friggin love these burritos. Today, I got the TVP plus vegan cheese plus guacamole and it was terribly delicious. I also appreciate how chill the space is whenever I've been there (often in contrast to the busyness of the rest of the market).  The price after the additions ($10.50, tax included) might sound steep for a burrito, but I'd argue that there's a lot of good stuff in there and, compared to other \"fast\" food, I think this is a much better option."}
{"text":"Won't bore everyone by repeating what was said by previous posters who gave similiar ratings.  One star off for the way it makes my, urm, digestive tract feel after...."}
{"text":"As a \"pizza\" vegan (I'll eat a limited amount of cheese on a pizza) and a fan of the Mission district in San Francisco (taco/burrito heaven), seeing the word vegan and burrito together this small shop caught my eye. Its on Baldwin right near Spadina.  I tried the TVP burrito and it was awesome. It renewed my faith in TVP recipes because it had a nice kick to it. The rice was great.  As noted the burrito was huge and most people will be more than full so if you eat the whole burrito and have issues later its likely related to fullness and nothing else.  Service was friendly and fast. Note to people about service problems. Like all folks some service industry people have bad days and sometimes you won't receive that Starbuck's fake greeting when you place an order."}
{"text":"If you are near here, you are already in Kensington Market and the area is full of good food options - say Wanda's Pie in the Sky for example. Go to one of them. Get food you will enjoy.  $10 got me a TVP Burrito with \"cheese\" and guac served by a disinterested server. I was upsold on my food choices, otherwise ignored, and the food was just okay.  I was a vegan for almost 20 years, and now eat some dairy, so I do appreciate being able to get vegetarian/vegan food. What I would appreciate even more though would be being able to get good vegetarian/vegan food.  Meh."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this Kensington Market gem and had to try it. As soon as I saw BBQ Jackfruit Tacos on the board, I knew I wanted to try them. Needless to say, they were absolutely delicious! The consistency of the jackfruit was amazing, and the flavour combinations were delicious. I will definitely be adding Hot Beans to my list of favourites in TO!"}
{"text":"3.5   I must preface this by saying I can't eat wheat, so, I imagine if I could try more of the menu, I would give hot beans a higher rate!   Great location - in the market, close to Spadina.   Neat shop and limited seating. It was also a little hard to find.   Since a lot of the items have soy sauce, I had to get a custom order of rice and beans within the taco corn tortillas. I found the tortillas were not warmed enough, so the tacos actually did not hold as they were not pliable enough (they have a portable skillet to warm them up, but I think they need to be on longer). I also came at a busy time, and since the shop is new and tiny - the guys seemed a little stressed out. There were a few things they ran out of as well (and forgot part of my order). This was just when I came - looking from the other reviews. this doesn't seem to be common.   The food is definitely tasty, but not super authentic tasty (the sauces could have more of a pep). However, given this is one of the few vegan taco/burrito places - pretty good.   The tortilla chips are really good (had it as a side), I think they bake them and add some spices,  but the salsa could have been more flavourful.   I am assuming they will work out the kinks of prepping and those doughnuts look amazing!   Again, I am sure you will find this place better if you can eat more of the menu (tofu, jackfruit with what seem to be yummy marinades). They have a few burrito and a few taco options - and of course the doughnuts. A few different hot sauces available and green containers. Not super cheap (relative to other taco places in the area), but it's vegan!! )."}
{"text":"Delicious food and delicious staff. I'll take the Peeb, please."}
{"text":"+1 star for being all vegan +1 star for tasty hot sauce and seasonings +1 star for decent service and good location  Just too heavy on the beans/proteins. Need to include a few more veggies in the burritos without considering them \"extras.\"  And that's just how it's gotta be done- yo. Sendin' some Bay Area love yall's way now hear?"}
{"text":"Us not being vegan, we thought we would try this place on a whim, thinking that it would just be something different.  1 x Seitan Burrito 1 x Bean Burrito w/ \"cheese\"  both with Guac  Easily the best burritos we have eaten in the city.  Fresh, full of flavor and fully vegan!  Also, make sure you try the lime coconut donuts.    Nommers!"}
{"text":"Hot beans is epic! Tiny little restaurant in the Kensington market area,  but pumping out big & bold flavours. I tried the TVP and Mac'n'cheese burritos & Bbq jackfruit &  lentil tacos. Different in taste but all morishly tasty. The TVP has a very meatish chopped up sausage consistency which is amazing. Last not but least,  if you're a fan of hot sauce,  their 'Habanero and tamarind' sauce is out of this world"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this place in hopes of the best tasting tacos we could find. My friend ordered the Jackfruit taco with rice and beans. All I can say it had a distinct taste to it. By no means bad but really bitter to my liking, maybe because of the chunks of jackfruit. I ordered the TVP taco with coleslaw and it had a much better taste to it. With a mild flavor from the taco and a nice side of coleslaw to reset your taste. The coleslaw not being the best I've eaten (that title goes to Jerk King) it was a pretty big side to go with your meal. For roughly $9 it really filled me up and got me going through the day.  I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends, but it's a pretty good place to eat if you're into vegan food or a hipster."}
{"text":"Not usually a huge fan of mexican or large amounts of soy but I was surprised. I got the jackfruit tacos with slaw, which were delicious and resembled meat tacos. Next time I won't get it delivered because it didn't travel well and kind of slopped everywhere."}
{"text":"Got the Mac and Cheese burrito, Jackfruit tacos and the nachos. The burrito was super satisfying, fairly greasy \"drunk food\". Felt like it need a sharper taste to offset all the starch but overall quite good. The Jackfruit taco had a delicious soft tortilla and the faux meat was good but a little on the plain side. The rice and beans that came with the taco were in desperate need of seasoning.  Now onto the nachos, AMAZING. Been vegan for 18 years and these were by far the best I've ever had. My omnivore friend was also impressed. What I would assume were homemade chips drowning in beans, guac and vegan sour cream. Totally sinful.   In summation, far from complex culinary excellence but definitely yummy, guilty pleasure vegan Mexican food that I would definitely frequent again."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the heart of Kensington Market. The jackfruit tacos are TO DIE FOR and if you get there early enough, you might be able to snag a vegan donut ;)"}
{"text":"A vegan burrito-lover's dream! Flavourful and really filling. Even my non-vegan friends dig the burritos here. Service may be a little slow, but it's because there's only one guy working, but the wait is worth it.  If you haven't had a chance to try the TVP burrito, do it now. Sadly, they're leaving the Market mid-March."}
{"text":"Such a good burrito for such a reasonable price! So big that me and me and my friend shared and we were still satisfied"}
{"text":"Tried the black bean and the tvp burritos with guacamole, both were great. Serving size is definitely adequate, and the price is competitive with other burrito places.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3.5 stars, although there is not that option on yelp so I am rounding to 3 stars. I've had the TVP tacos, and they were quite delicious. My fellow gluten-free friend always goes for and raves about the jackfruit taco. My other friend who I always go with always gets a burrito of some sort and seems to enjoy it. The servings are good and I am often left unable to finish my \"side\" chips.   And of course it's in my most fave neighbourhood, Kensington Market. A great place to eat after wandering the streets for the day.  The service is polite but unmemorable. As another reviewer wrote, \"disinterested\" - a great descriptor for these guys.   Why I'm not giving them a million stars like everyone else? 1. The sitting area is brutal. It's some stools at a narrow counter. Perhaps ideal for super tall people who eat alone, I am not so tall and like to eat with friends. This is the main thing that would stop me from bringing my non-vegan buddies here - the food is definitely enjoyable enough but, damnit, I want to talk while I eat not just shovel down food. 2. Price. WHAT is with vegan places being insanely priced?? This place isn't terrible, it's about the same as getting food anywhere I suppose...But for TVP and corn tacos? Those are like the two cheapest ingredients in the world! Also $1 for guacamole? Are you kidding me?? I will buy an avocado not even a block away for LESS than $1 and make myself and everyone around me our OWN guacamole! But, since nearby Rancho Relaxo charges $15 for the same amount of food...I guess by comparison it's a great price. And if you're jonesing for tex mex, it's definitely tastier."}
{"text":"4.5/5! This is another great tacos place in Kensington Market. As someone who has never tried jackfruit, I highly recommend the BBQ jackfruit taco. I only had one and I was pretty full after it. I also recommend the TVP taco if you want some protein, however, you really can't go wrong with any of them. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food, made to order. Perfection. Jackfruit tacos and Elvis burrito are my recs."}
{"text":"Vegan for 10 years, I was excited about the opening of hot beans-especialy in kensington market since i am often there. I was so disappointed. The food leaves such a heavy feeling in my stomach. The only item that I could literally stomach is the jackfruit pulled tacos. The seitan burrito.. yikes. The pieces of seitan were HUGE, dry, and really not very chewable. My children will eat just about anything vegan, and after one bite, they refused any more. The bean burrito, same thing-left a really heavy feeling. The coconut lime doughnut that so many rave about. Well, it was just a cakey (not light), dense piece of dough that sit in my belly. I even asked a friend to go and buy one just so make sure it isn't just me. Maybe it's because I prefer healthier foods, and don't use salt in my cooking, but I can't eat here anymore.  Also, the service was really inexcusable. The only time I've ever been treated nicely and spoken to while there, was by an employee-not one of the rude owners. When I was asking a question to one of them once, she even said she would 'pass the message on to the owners.' I pointedly asked her, 'aren't you one of the owners?' she had the audacity to say 'i meant the others.' Right. This is what happens when young suburban types come downtown, with their ___ is right mentality. No thanks"}
{"text":"I ate the WHOLE thing.   It was the bean burrito and the Lime/Coconut doughnut. It really is minimum 2 meals. But it was good and I was hungry.  I really wouldn't get the bean burrito again, the beans were firm. I like them softer (easier on the digestive tract). I will try the Seitan next time.   Very flavour full. The staff is nice too."}
{"text":"The more I come here, the more I find to like about it.  I'm keeping the star rating at four, but I recently had the TVP steak burrito, and found that the filling ratio and variety were damn-near perfect.  This could quickly become my favourite burrito in the city.  Gotta try their breakfast options soon!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews. Ate here. Was not disappointed. Apparently everyone else decided to eat here too today as the hot beans were already consumed, but the lentils weren't and they were VERY tasty. Got the bowl with the rice, guac, coleslaw, and filled me right up.   5 stars, hands down. Will be back. Service was nice too."}
{"text":"There are tacos or there are burritos.   Under their recommendation I had the TVP Burrito with guacamole.   It was pretty good! And $9... so it had better be. Certainly no steal - as such I'll give this an A-OK.  Does not get bonus points from me for being vegan.  Blahblahblah vegan vegan vegan."}
{"text":"We tried the black bean and the seitan burritos and they were worth coming back for. This place is mainly for takeout but there are some seats available inside. They were out of the vegan mac n cheese but I would have loved to try that burrito!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but as a vegetarian I have a real appreciation for food done well, sans meat. There are a bunch of 'mexican' joints in the market, but I don't mind walking a little further to go to Hot Beans. It's sort of my weekly treat.  The place is a little hard to find at the boring end of Baldwin, and you don't quite know what door to pick on the first go. Are they open? Yes they are! Go in, now!  The food is so damn good, and all the meat textures are excellent, even if you are not trying to pretend it actually is meat. It's just good. Donuts are also just as good as any donut I've had before. It's not cheap, but when the food is this good, and this specialized it's worth it. Also, the forks and packaging are biodegradable, and that is worth paying a bit more for."}
{"text":"I took my dad here who is NOT a vegan and never wants to be one. But he absolutely loved the Mac and cheese burrito!! I also loved my choice, the black bean burrito. Loads of flavour and the perfect amount of spice. Also- their limeade is delicious and very refreshing! So great to find a little spot that is serious about good, delicious, all-vegan food. YUM!"}
{"text":"Okay, I really should be deducting stars because I feel unwell after my visits - probably because the portions are so big! However, I'll add a star because sometimes gluttony is good! ;^p  In four visits, I've had three burritos and a vegan donut! All were awesome and almost more food than I could handle.   On my most recent visit, I had the breakfast burrito - a few hours after I ate breakfast. It was huge and equally as tasty. Photo here...  http://www.flickr.com/photos/ifindoubt/6030702798/"}
{"text":"I walked through the doors and was greeted by the strong smell of spices. After asking the server a few questions (\"What does TVP stand for?\" \"Can I get 2 tacos, each of a different kind?\") and receiving friendly answers, I ordered a TVP and a bean curd taco.   The tacos were the same flavour as the smell that I first noticed walking into the restaurant - very flavourful and tasty. After the first few bites, though, I realized perhaps the taste was a little too strong for me. I find that there's a balance between bland food - which the food here certainly wasn't - and overly salted and spiced foods that overpower your tastebuds, so to speak. I couldn't tell any difference in taste between the two tacos.   It was an interesting adventure into vegan Mexican cuisine for me, but I would have to go with more subtle flavours found at other establishments."}
{"text":"I had the jackfruit tacos and rice and beans on the basis of the reviews on here.  All I can say is I full on disagree.  It was filling, but not satiating.  I didn't like it."}
{"text":"Yum! As a vegetarian in love with Mexican food, this place made me so happy! Really liked their breakfast wrap and lentil wrap. Definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, and so is the music. The salsa was chipotle style, good tasting, good spices, but not very hot. The refried beans were just ok. The rice was just ok. We had to add salsa to both to get any real flavors from them. The shrimp tacos were pretty good, same deal with the salsa.  Overall probably would return!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Just moved to Toronto from Winnipeg and have gone here twice so far. Lots of options as a Vegan in this city and Hot Beans is definitely one of my top ones so far.  I had one of their breakfast burritos on my most recent visit and it was unreal. I've also had the jackfruit tacos and those were also delicious.  Highly recommend this place. Although there's next to no seating since its mostly a take-out place you just have to be ok with feeling a little cramped.   Just missed their special Mac and cheese with vegan hot dogs burrito.   Check it out."}
{"text":"Saw this walking to Kensington markets and stepped inside to see what was on the menu. I'm not usually a Mexican food fan but this was my favourite yet. I could handle the spice, and I'm a wimp, so that meant I could taste the great guacamole too! Loved the taquitos. Makes great use of the small space and the music was pretty adorable. Also home made limeade was yum."}
{"text":"Excellent TVP burrito prepared and served by a sullen guy with the personality of a wet dish rag. I've been there twice - same experience each time with different staff. Burrito is 4 stars but the service drops the experience to 3."}
{"text":"Holy Hot Beans, Batman! Toronto's latest vegan haunt is rocking some serious taste mojo. They've been open barely a week now, but having even only been there once, I wish they'd ALWAYS bean here. (Oh yes.)  Toronto's got some fairly decent vegan options at a lot of burrito places, but this is the city's first 100% dedicated vegan Mex takeout joint (the place isn't huge, but if you want to sit in there is a small area with stools as you walk in). Their deal is burritos and tacos, and there's a few different types on each side of the fence (plus one option for a nacho meal). I couldn't hone in on one taco filling, and asked if I could mix/match which they were happy to do - I ended up with a Yuba 'chicken' taco and a jackfruit 'pulled pork' taco, opting for rice 'n' beans as my side (a very decent portion!). Fresh soft tortillas could barely contain the deliciousness or my excitement, and I scoffed it all down post-haste. The rice and beans were fresh and flavourful, and a damn fine accompaniment to the meal.   I washed it all down with a homemade limeade, which was sweet and refreshing; considering the only pop they offer are pretty standard brands (nothing like Boylans, which disappoints a little) I don't think i'd opt for any other drink now i've had it! Not content with the face stuffing to this point, I topped off my meal with a freshly made donut - fluffy, deep fried, doughy goodness slathered with a decadent chocolate frosting (with a nice little hint of cinnamon, amaaaazing). I fear the donuts (of many flavours apparently, but chocolate was on offer when I visited) will be my downfall. Delicious, wonderful downfall.  Other things of note - there's free water for drinks, plus a couple of options of homemade hotsauce (the habanero is DELISH!), prices aren't dead cheap but very reasonable for quality & quantity for sure, their takeout containers etc are green-friendly biodegradable brands, and the staff are just lovely and seem genuinely into what they are doing with this joint. Viva la Hot Beans! Viva la stuffing my belly with their delicious treats for many moons to come!"}
{"text":"BBQ jackfruit tacos with coke slaw is a great pairing"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here.   Ordered jackfruit taco (I love jackfruit, I ate it all the time growing up) but the way this jackfruit was prepared was gritty and gross. I had two bites and apologized - I couldn't eat it. I asked the guy behind the counter, who was presumably to owner, to cancel the debit transaction. Instead he scratched his head and went off into a rant about how he's been selling them for 2 years and nobody's ever turned them down. For a good ten minutes he just ranted and then tried the tacos I returned. He shook his head again and said \"Nope, this is the way these are supposed to taste,\" and then put it back on the counter towards me as though I was supposed to eat it (um, not after you've just taken a bite, dude. really.) Finally he gave me some cash back for it. I felt so bad for rejecting it, but it was gross. I left feeling guilty, which is a way no customer should feel when leaving. I'm in Kensington pretty frequently with other vegan friends, but I always ask to steer clear of this place when we look for places to eat. Sorry, but that experience was just too much trouble for me."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Got the burrito bowl with black beans and brown rice. The vegan cheese sauce is delicious, such a hearty meal for the health conscious vegan! Food was quick  and so yummy, perfect amount of it too."}
{"text":"I take my burrito or taco with beans and it tastes amazing! One star off because I wish there were more vegetable options."}
{"text":"It's not hard to get a good vegan burrito in this city -- even Chipotle provides a pretty tasty option if you hold the sour cream and cheese -- but somehow Hot Beans, a place dedicated to nothing other than vegan burritos, manages to barely reach the level of mediocrity while charging a premium.   Brown rice instead of white? That's a dollar extra. Guacamole? That's extra, too. Fresh salsa, cilantro, jalapenos, or corn? Not available. What you can get are timidly spiced fillings: chewy TVP nuggets, oddly peanut-seasoned seitan, or gloppy and bland black beans."}
{"text":"This is just to say  I have eaten  the burritos and the donuts that were in  your shop  And which you were probably saving for a special customer  Forgive me they were delicious so sweet and so bean-y.  (Credit: William Carlos Williams, translated by Val G.)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  Both times I had the black bean burrito with guacamole.    Twice because I really like their burritos.  I can taste it's not canned beans, so it tastes fresh to me.  I think it was $8 or 9.50 with guacamole.  Yes a bit pricey but I think the quality is there.  So I'll be back when I want some lunch."}
{"text":"So delicious you don't even miss the meat.  Seriously. The TVP is like a magical bizarro rendition of beef and the Yuba bean curd was tasty and filling.  The condiments are spot on, so make sure you spring for that guac and try some of the hot sauce.  Prices are decent for Vegan cuisine, and portions are really large - if you aren't super Hungry you might want to share. Sitting area is tiny, hot and somewhat awkward, so I would recommend getting take-out and eating in the park if it's nice."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of months ago. Staff looks depressed and the food was godawful. I can't recall which burrito I got but it was completely inedible. Garbage."}
{"text":"The food is pricey and the staff is grumpy (why are you grumpy, hipster burrito guys? You are all so grouchy and smile-less...maybe you don't belong in the service industry?) , but I do love the TVP in ancho sauce, and the burrito is definitely big enough to have leftovers."}
{"text":"A very tasty burrito, vegan or otherwise. I've always gotten the TVP with guacamole, brown rice, whole wheat wrap, home made \"cheese\". Very filling, to the point of being cold weather food.  Take out with a few bar style seats. Hey, chef guy, smile :)"}
{"text":"Hot Beans.... I dream about you.  My boyfriend & I were roaming around Kensington Market when we stumbled upon Hot Beans... totally pulled in by the Vegan Burrito sign.  Now, Toronto rocks when it comes to the array of veg friendly restaurants... but this place seemed to stick out, plus I'm almost positive a friend of mine mentioned it... so we entered. It was really clean inside with bar style seats in the window so we could people watch.   The only downfall is the menu is a tiny bit pricy, but you do get a lot for what you buy.. so... meh.  I got the TVP, and he got the Black Bean Sweet Potato burrito. Both were about the size of a submarine, you could definitely get at least two (if not three) meals off one burrito. Absolute deliciousness! My omnivore boyfriend was drooling over the veg protein.  When we end up back in Toronto, we will definitely return. In the meantime... Hot Beans... will you please deliver to Portland, Maine right now?"}
{"text":"I am not vegan. I cannot imagine eating a taco or burrito without cheese. But my friends raved about this place, and since Seven Lives around the corner was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday I couldn't get my fish taco fix and so I thought I'd check Hot Beans out.  I tried the BBQ jackfruit and the spicy lentil tacos. The jackfruit taco was delicious, with a texture reminiscent of shredded chicken. The lentil taco was also very tasty, but not as \"wow\" to me as the jackfruit. The house-made limeade is also really good."}
{"text":"Okay - so seriously - the logo confused me because I literally thought this place was a coffee joint.  C'mon! Brown logo, it has the word \"beans\" and \"hot\" - so I'm thinking \"COFFEE!\"  Good thing my friend's sister knew that this was a vegan Mexican joint.  I AM SO HAPPY THAT I WENT.  I was craving for Mexican food on Sunday.  Like - REALLY craving it.   After having a little snack at Agave & Aguacate, I was thinking \"BOY, I NEED MORE FOOD.\"  So we ended up there.  My brother's sister ordered the famous lime-coconut donut with some nachos.  My friend and I ordered the TVP \"beef\" burrito.  I may be biased because I'm use to eating vegetarian/vegan \"meat\" - but the fake meat was great and -- really -- the burrito was qutie satisfying.  OMNOMNOMNOM.    The nachos were pretty good too!  However, the guacamole wasn't the best guacamole I've had in town (I would have to say Chiptole has better).  However, still filling.  The donut was delicious - however, I think it would've been so much better if it was just freshly made.  The great thing about this place!  Everything's biodegradable!  There's no such thing as a garbage can!  Only a green bin and a recylcing bin can be found.  Loved it."}
{"text":"It's amazing what these guys did with a small space and a hot plate. Their menu and their physical location are so perfectly basic and wonderful.  I've been of the general opinion that a burrito's quality is inversely proportional to its distance from California, so I really didn't expect to find mouth-watering ones in Canada. I would like to apologize to Hot Beans for my arrogant assumptions and for ever doubting you.  Also, while I love tofu personally, I'm a little tired of it being the only vegan-meat option, so I really appreciated Hot Beans offering TVP, seitan, and jackfruit instead."}
{"text":"Hot Beans is the first place I hit up when I visit Toronto. The Jackfruit Tacos are AMAZING and everything on the menu is fresh and delicious!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I got the spicy beef burrito -- first 1/3 of the burrito, i thought it was amazing (and it was vegan!) but after that, it went downhill. The meat started having such a bad texture, and it started to get really gross. I ended up throwing out about 1/3 of it =\  Maybe not being a vegan..i dont appreciate it as much because I can eat real beef. It was a good experience and the decor was cute, but i dont think i'd order this again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS! This is an over hyped, cult following place. I don't know what the hell y'all are thinking giving this place such high reviews. I have tried to eat here 3 times & I have not twice because of such rude service. The third time however I just wanted to try the damn food everyone was going on about.  To start off the service was this young guy, who I would say was rather miserable. I asked him about the food, which ones I could have because I could not eat gluten. He informed me on a couple dishes. I ordered one with nacho chips. Thankfully my lovely wife had caught the fact they were cooked in the same fryer as gluten so infact they were not gluten free at all. We changed our order immediately. We ended up ordered two tacos; one dragon fruit, one lentil and a side of coleslaw. The food was bland at best, nothing to ride home about and to add on top of it I find it very over priced.  The atmosphere was gross and dirty with limited seating.  I'll probably get lynched for this review but to be honest I really dislike this place and don't plan on coming back. They screwed up on everything; food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"A lot has already been said about Hot Beans, so I'll keep this short. The Beans are indeed Hot. There is no false advertising here. Not exactly spicy-hot, but warm-hot. But still a completely appropriate title. A more appropriate title however would have been Hot-Delicious-Filling-Vegan-Beans-Jackfruit-TVP-Lentils-Burritos-Tacos-Nachos-and-Doughnuts. I'm really surprised they didn't go with that."}
{"text":"First of all, there is NO place like this in the city, and its about freakin time! The menu is the perfect size and not overwhelming, the location is hot, and the food is fresh and all handmade (including the seitan).  I want to try everything - and I will - but tonight I tried the TVP \"Beef\" Burrito as well as a Yuba \"Chicken\" Taco and Jackfruit \"Pulled Pork\" Taco with the most delicious homemade coleslaw I've ever had on the side. This was all shared, BTW. I had been dreaming of cashew sour cream for days leading up to this too, because I knew it would be like the one they serve at Live (where the chef's worked prior), and my dreams were fulfilled tonight! Excellent. The strips of bean curd used in the \"chicken\" taco and the jackfruit \"pulled pork\" tasted amazing and both something I've never seen done before. The \"Beef\" Burrito was the best vegan \"beef\" I've ever had and I'm not the biggest fan of \"mock meat\" or TVP (textured vegetable protein) for that matter. But Hot Beans preps and cooks it right. The burrito is massive, stuffed with garlic-annatto rice, refried black beans, pico de gallo, cashew sour cream, and a fresh cilantro-jalapeno salsa. YUMMO!  If you can believe I had more room, I also had a chocolate cinnamon donut. I know... vegan donuts!! YES. The selection may vary from day to day, but also look for a cafe con leche and coconut-lime variety. You will die! Hmm the only thing I didn't eat and should've were the hot beans! Next time.  I actually ate here for the first time on a \"soft\" opening 2 days prior to the restaurants official opening, so I can't really comment on regular service etc. BUT the place was rammed and they made full portion meals for every customer and it wasn't a long wait. There's NOT a lot of seating but luckily burritos are walk and go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch in a big group (~15 people). The staff were cool and totally unphased by the sudden influx of customers. There were only 2 guys working, so it took a while for everyone's order to be ready but overall, I was impressed. Seating is quite limited, just a few stools, so we walked over the the park off Augusta and ate there.   I had the TVP Burrito that was recommended by a friend who eats here often. I added nacho \"cheese\" for $0.50. The burrito was super-filling and I couldn't finish the whole thing! They really pack them with a lot of filling. The TVP was interesting. I'm not vegetarian or vegan, so I generally don't pick faux-meat. But this TVP was pretty yummy. The texture is interesting and uneven, but didn't bother me. I did find it a bit salty overall though. The nacho cheese added a nice kick, although it is really drippy so watch out not to make a mess on yourself! There were some vegetables and rice in the burrito, but they don't ask you specifically what you want. You can add hot sauce, although I didn't. I think next time I might splurge on the guacamole ($1 extra)."}
{"text":"Most half of the people who've reviewed Hot Beans are my friends, but I can't seem to share as much love for Hot Beans.   While the gluten burrito is tasty and, as Garry C. reviewed, the portions are hefty, it doesn't have all the components necessary for a TRUE burrito. I feel as if I can't really even call it a burrito, which ought to have a fine balance between fresh cilantro, sour cream, tomatoes, beans - a melange of all these flavours coming together to create the perfect gustatory symphony. What you get at Hot Beans isn't that. It tastes mostly of tomato-flavoured gluten and is a bit harsh and acidic.   Don't get me wrong, it's still a good meal. But IMHO, it's NOT a burrito.  The ingredients are made fresh and the tortillas are beautifully made - not like the nasty El Paso sticky white-bread version you'd get in a plastic bag at your local supermarket. Just don't come here expecting to get Mexican food.  3/5 STARS"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have only just recently tried this place out. Last week, actually back up... a few additional weeks prior to that when my sister and I were in the area, I had seen Hot Beans but wasn't feeling like it was a burrito-or-Mexican-inspired-food kinda day, you know it has to be that kind of day where you feel like eating what you are about to.   So last week I went in and bought myself a black bean burrito with guacamole... no. 1: 10 bucks for a burrito... what an incredible price, for the size you get! I haven't been to Chipotle on Yonge since they've opened, to recall what their price point was like, to have somewhat of a comparison. But Hot Beans is incomparable to Chipotle because Hot Beans is vegan and therefore rules and to a large extent may induce drooling! (remember the old saying, when something rules, the other thing drools? Well, this place happily contains both ruling and drooling!)   Also, no. 2: I am part South American and avocados are, try to have them be, a staple in my diet. And a solidly ripe avocado is extremely important to me. Thus following, this place delivered on a satisfying lunch because their guacamole is made of fresh, RIPE avocados. No. 3: The service was exceptionally fast, could've been a little friendlier, but I wasn't in that mood that day so not a lot of chit-chat was exactly what I needed! Thank you to the young man on the other side of the counter for that!  I will most likely be returning to try more of their delicious menu items and I am in absolute anticipation until then.   Oh lastly, as if it could ever be last, it should be at the top of the list; perhaps no. 0: the HOT SAUCE..... amaZing!!!! I would definitely go back just to pick up some of that. I've seen in some photos. It is apparently available for purchase?"}
{"text":"After three years of eating veggie burritos around Toronto, I can conclude that Hot Beans is the best available. The food here isn't light fare, by any means so don't go too big unless you can deal with the food coma afterwards.   Flavours are big and robust, nothing like of sad burritos at the rest of the Toronto burrito shops. The tacos are legit too. My favourite thing to order are the jack fruit tacos with a side of slaw. Or, if I'm ask the right person, a jack fruit burrito bowl. Delicious!   Service has always been fine for me, friendly enough and sometimes very plain. Don't forget that the general rule is if you're getting shitty service, you might be a shitty customer.   Go eat here while you can!"}
{"text":"I went to Hot Beans with promises of vegan donuts and didn't see anything of the sort! Grabbing some hangover food before questing to the airport so that I could take a loooong plane home to Calgary, I went to Kensington Market, with high hopes of the best vegan junk food.  We were barely greeted by the too-hip burrito maker/cashier, but I forgive this as it was the middle of a beautiful day in Kensington market and he was stuck inside making vegan burritos. I requested an order of nachos, and two TVP burritos with guac- for myself and my omnivorous friend. The environment was a little too quiet and awkward for us to want to stay, so we took our order to go.  As we gorged on our nachos; which included uncheese sauce, sunflower sour cream, salsa, guac, and black beans, the omnivore stated he didn't have high hopes for Hot Beans as he isn't a \"vegan food\" kind of dude, but was actually super stoked on them. I would have to agree as I think the nachos were amazing.  The TVP chunks in my burrito, I could have done without, and in fact would have almost preferred a burrito with only the fixings and none of the fake meat. I would give Hot Beans five stars for the nachos, but have to subtract two stars for the uncomfortableness, priciness, and absence of donuts."}
{"text":"This place is the FUBU of mexican takeout, except it's For Vegans By Vegans.  It's no secret that most Mexican can be made vegan friendly-- just omit cheese and sour cream from a vegetarian menu item.  The result is usually overpriced and unbalanced in flavour, but hey, at least you're eating, right?  That all goes out the window at Hot Beans, where every menu item is a well thought out star.  No veggie ground-round, no copious amounts of daiya cheese.  Instead, their menu boasts things like jackfruit, TVP, queso, and cashew crema.  Their flavours are novel and surprising.  You'll like it not just because it is veg-friendly but because their take on Mexican food is new, fresh, and most importantly, delicious."}
{"text":"Still can't believe its vegan. Tried the TVP burrito and the taccos with guac.   Very simple but tastes pretty good. Not the best thing in the world that I have eaten but definitely the best vegan food that I have had. The only other time we had similar quality vegan food was at a place in Hawaii.  Give it a shot and be amazed. At least we were :) Pretty small joint though, i would not  advise a large group."}
{"text":"Looking for good, quick Vegan/Vegetarian options? Look no further."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan burritos!  Went here twice during a short trip to Toronto.  Good prices and hearty food.  Bring your non-veggie friends here.  This is as good as a vegan burrito gets and one of the best vegan burritos I ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try one of these vegan burritos after reading all the glowing reviews. Never very good at making decisions, I asked for a burrito made of half bean, half TVP. The guy at the counter was super friendly and accommodating, and I was eager to dig in to my halfling creation.   The first few bites were great -- the texture was meaty and the taste was interesting -- but as I continued eating, I found the burrito to have a pretty flat flavour profile, and I felt a bit \"heavy\" afterwards, even though I couldn't even finish the hefty burrito. I wish there was something like a scoop of guacamole or a bit of cilantro to round out the flavour and add a bit of freshness.   Also, it turns out they don't serve the donuts that other Yelpers have been raving about anymore! Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is Food...   Vegetarian, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Vegan... or what not...   For me that eat \"almost\" everything.. I can probably go down to Big Fat Burrito or Mexican Salsa a few minute walk from Hot Beans and still have a good meal...   But when I am dining with my Vegan, Vegetarian friends, Hot Beans would be a way way better options....at least I know they can eat everything from the menu.. and not limited to 1 or 2 items at other places...   TVP Burrito ($8.50)  - Big Huge burrito... staring at the burrito.. I was wishing someone will share with me and we all get fat together....(someone told me that it will go right through because it is vegan... sounded like fairy tales to me!)  - There were a lot of \"Beef\" inside as filling.. they are a little salty.... but they have good texture and good bite..  - I tried to make it more spicy with more hot sauce at the counter, but it did not really work...  - Wish there are more herb and spice to it, maybe I should have pay 50 cents extra for the guacamole?   The only complaint I have for Hot Beans is really who measured and designed those seating??  The counter was way too low and the bar stools were way too high!! (I took a photo to prove that!!) I was crouching and bending my body in order to have a bite of my burrito while all the fillings are falling all over the place...   I need to get those donuts next time! I will feed that to my Hot \"Yoga\" Date...or maybe try some of the tacos when I picking up those donuts..."}
{"text":"So glad we got here before they are gone forever! Get there by Sunday to get yours.  First time having jackfruit, the tacos were fantastic!  My son had the Mac truck burrito ( ask for it).  He is on the picky side but wolfed it down.  Who wouldn't love Mac n' cheese in their burrito?  Staff was friendly and fun, wish we had time to get there again before we leave."}
{"text":"I'm totally late to the Hot Beans phenomenon.  After hearing about it from my partner, I popped by one work day & we went there for lunch.  I have to admit - the prices make me scoff a little.  But times are a-changing in Kensington & I will pay more for specialized food where the people are nice.  Delicious!  & so good to know that with their vegan know-how, I won't be paying the price for the \"sour cream\".  (Sigh, dairy...)  I tried the tacos this time, but next time.  Burrito-City!  Oh, & if you're a fan of their vegan donuts ($2/each) - check out their twitter account.  They post what sorts they have each morning.  A girl likes to stay updated on her baked good possibilities."}
{"text":"Tried this place last week and damn is it good.  Not your conventional burrito with sour cream and what not.  These have a really tasty tamarind-based hot sauce, and very meaty tasting TVP.  If you want a vegetarian burrito, this is the place to go, Toronto.  They also do a peanut sauce/seitan burrito that rivals the TVP one.  I found the latter a tad heavy but still delicious.  Haven't tried the donuts and frankly the last thing I'd want to do after eating one of these massive burritos is wash it down with a donut.  Anyway, this is one of those vegan places you can recommend to anyone.  Excellent addition to Kensington."}
