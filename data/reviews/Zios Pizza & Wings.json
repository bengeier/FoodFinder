{"text":"I tend not to write many reviews let alone negative ones, but I had a very poor experience with Zio's. I ordered via GrubHub, and while the pizza arrived on time, it was not what I had ordered. My pizza had 2 out of the 4 toppings that I had paid for, and both my pizza and wings were cold. I asked the delivery driver for $10 in change but he said he only had $8, so I wound up paying $32 for a $24 order of tiny and cold wings and a pizza that was missing toppings that I had paid for (on top of not actually tasting good!). I'm not sure if the fact that I used GrubHub to order this meal had any impact on the outcome, but the food was overpriced garbage delivered by a dazed and confused driver."}
{"text":"Kids were eager for me to try pizza that they had ordered out at a school function. We ordered pick up which was about 25 mins. Workers looked like locals from the neighborhood and were friendly. Prices were same as other local pizzeria competitors. Kids had the pepperoni pizza & I tried the Zio's favorite. The pepperoni pizza was good with the flavors coming from the sauce. The crust was soft & chewy if you like your crust that way. I had the Zio's favorite. The pizza looked tasty. I took my first bite and hadn't had the sauce taste or flavors from the pepperoni pizza. I had hoped to at least taste more garlic on the favorite. Great pizza just a short execution on taste (more garlic flavor please). Overall 1st experience was good and a plus is that if you're looking for a bite to eat after a late night out they are open until early morning."}
{"text":"Average pizza.  Could've gotten better and cheaper at Pizza Patron.  The review, however,  is for the completely unethical and borderline illegal practice of adding a tip onto the debit card receipt!  Total for pizza was 11.88.  Total debited from my account?  15.88!  Way to go guys.  For four dollars you lost a customer from the neighborhood and everyone now knows what scum you are!  Good luck."}
{"text":"Wow it was the best 32inches pizza i ever had Thank you guys I strongly recommend every one to try it"}
{"text":"Great pizza great price!  Ordered the 32\" pizza for the kids while they swam. They loved it. It's thin crust New York style but still delicious. Store is located in a dumpy strip mall but is clean and neatly kept."}
{"text":"Food was great. Only had a pepperoni pizza but still on par with much more expensive pizzerias. Service was good - it was 3 am, 2 men working, one was on the phone but the other stepped up and completed my order promptly and courteously. Love the convenience of their hours as I'm a total night owl. Will order again!"}
{"text":"I've been known to post bad reviews on this site, when I run into bad food or service.  It's only fair then, to write one when the food and service is exceptional.  Just ordered from Zios pizza and wings. Last week, I had had a nasty experience with a Chinese restaurant that I reviewed.  Grub hub was nice enough to give me a credit back on that mess of a meal. So, not wanting to lose my generous credit, I started looking at another place to order from. This time, before just ordering from another restaurant,  I thought I'd be wiser this time and read the reviews.  Strangely,  the reviewers seemed to be split 50/50 on this place. So, deciding to take a positive chance, I ordered from Zios pizza and wings. They gave me a delivery time of about of about 1hr 10 minutes. With many of the negative reviews related to their 2hr deliveries etc, I crossed my fingers! Well, delivered exactly on time, and piping hot as well. Ordered 14\" meat lovers pizza, order of garlic knots, and honey barbecue wings. Everything was absolutely fantastic.  Piping hot, rich flavors, and extremely tasty. 5 stars guys. Will certainly reorder again. Hope this helps others in their meal decisions."}
{"text":"Love this spot!! 24 hour dining hall!!! Right next to my gym LA Fitness!!!! Wings and pizza is bomb.com!!! And they have the classic video games!!!!!!!!!!  Must try!"}
{"text":"BEST. GARLIC. KNOTS. EVER. Absolutely the best I've ever had. The dough was fresh and chewy, and when you broke it apart, it had the perfect amount of stretch. Perfect amount of garlic - not overpowering in the slightest. I could live on just the knots forever.  We ordered a pepperoni and pineapple pizza as well and it was delicious. Lovely flavours. The pineapple still tasted like pineapple and had a great crunch. Everything was hot and made super fast - much faster than expected. The guys in the store were super friendly and seemed to enjoy being there - despite our order coming in at midnight. I can definitely see that they use fresh ingredients, too - when we walked in to get our order, the guy in the kitchen was tossing fresh dough! I will most definitely order from here again, and I'm gonna tell everyone I know to try it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place can't get enough food is awesome service always on point plus they make everything fresh highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered online easily for take out.  I had conformation that  4 pizzas& 20 wings would be done in 15minutes. I was showed up 20 minutes thinking I would still have to wait and to my suprise my order was waiting for me! Pizza was excellent, service was friendly, inside was clean. I ordered  hot wings & they were more than hot which I love! Next time I will try the suicide wings. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"The food is ok but I waites 50 minutes for a 14 inch and 10 wings. Thats not really a good thing since I ordered online and it said about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Wow! They're open until 5am! The food is great & the service is AWESOME! There may be a wait for the food, but it's sooooooo worth it! You're gonna Love this place!"}
{"text":"So, here's my story. I'm 12 weeks pregnant with my 5th child and in the throughs of morning sickness. These days I have a hard time keeping anything down, which leaves me little desire to eat anything. But one thing I am ALWAYS in the mood for is Zios. Somehow, it seems like the only thing I don't throw up these days. They have a really large selection, it's not just pizza, they have amazing pizza rolls, that they make in sausage or pepperoni, their chicken Alfredo has hot, fresh chicken on top and came with garlic bread, Their salads are AMAZING, I crave their homemade ranch dressing, so yummy. They always put up with my odd requests... can I have a side of fresh mushrooms or ranch instead of chipotle ranch? I love this place. Without zios, I think I would starve during this stage in my pregnancy. They even have a kids menu. Thank you, Zios!"}
{"text":"i love this place, it's within walking distance of the new Club Red, their dining room is open till 5am, and they deliver to like 4.30am. Yeah it can take a while, usually over 35 minutes for delivery, then again they're a real new york style pizza place, they dont have all assembly line bullshit and weird pizza oven with the conveyor belt, they have a real pizza oven and they take their time making some bomb pizza. If you order the Roni Rolls, I recommend that you ask them to go light on the garlic butter, or you'll drown in it. I always get a pizza with fresh garlic, tomatoes, spinach, ricotta and salami and it is absolutely amazing. What ever you do, just get ricotta on your pizza, you have no idea what you're missing."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by this place. I got a flier on my door with a great deal for wings, pizza, and garlic knots for 20.99. I hopped on Yelp and saw only positive reviews and got my hopes up for a delicious experience.   They quoted me 45-50 minutes for delivery, but it actually took 75 minutes for the food to arrive. This was early on a Tuesday afternoon.   The garlic knots were blackened to a crisp on the bottom, which ruined the flavor. They were loaded up with butter, garlic salt, and parmesan, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes. I personally found them a bit too salty.   The pizza was a good value for the price. The sauce is really tasty. I ordered pepperoni and extra cheese. The pizza didn't seem very cheesy though. However it was already cold and looked a day old by the time it was delivered so that could have something to do with it.   The wings... oh wait, they forgot to deliver my wings! I called them back for the 3rd time (first to order, second to make sure that they got my order) and the driver returned 30 minutes later with my wings. After two hours, I finally had my complete order.   Initially, instead of the wings, I was given the saddest gyro I have ever seen. Three strips of meat and a whole lot of pita. It was actually pretty tasty though. Thanks for the freebie, Zio's!   The scrawny lil' suicide wings will light your mouth on fire. They were my favorite part of the meal.   I would go back for their $5 large pizza. It's just as good as any of the other cheapo pizza places with $5 pies. Just don't expect anything special from Zio's."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro and a medium pizza. (delivery order) They are less than a mile from my home the food was cold the veggies in the gyro were wilted and slimy.. The cucumber sauce was gross as well....  Worst gyro I've had in all my life."}
{"text":"Good pizza, they overcharged me by about ten dollars due to their mistake, also didn't include any of the sides which I ordered and was charged for. The driver wasn't helpful and suggested that I leave him the extra as a tip (about 11 dollars) . I signed for the pizza and called the restaurant. The manager didn't offer to reverse the incorrect delivery charge (and I had already signed for it as the drivers tip) but he did offer to redo the whole transaction for fifty cents less because I did not get the ranch dressing. I don't know if it was intended to make me feel ridiculous, all that effort for fifty cents and no offer of correcting the delivery charge. Of course I felt embarrassed and wanted to get off the phone. He did offer me a 5% discount on my next delivery as I said \"fine, no, yeah, fine, bye, sorry.\"  Of course like the little weasel I am I get angry later at my own passivity (civility?). Don't be confused, they are good pizza, and I'm not steaming mad. Just mad, and I do feel like I got taken for a ride. wheeeeeeeee one star"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I was skeptical due to some of the not so good reviews, but I gave them a try and I'm glad that I did.    Ingredients are fresh! Sauce is delicious. Bread is just okay, but that's what makes it so good.   Delivery did take a long time. 75 minutes to be exact, but it was worth it. Go for one of the specials so the price stays low."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas, neither were cut, one pizza had the wrong toppings. 3/8 garlic knots were raw. Found them from a door flyer. Probably should of thrown it out instead of wasting $30"}
{"text":"Literally the best wings I've ever had. New favorite delivery restaurant! Open super late so convenient for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Ate here a while ago, the food was horrible and delivery took over an hour and a half.  Also, they have been leaving flyers on my door lately, so I'll definitely never be doing business with you guys again."}
{"text":"I live really close to here and their garlic knots and gyro are pretty great but all of the other appetizers I have tried (fried zucchini, loaded fries, etc.) have just not been good. The sauce on the honey BBQ wings is awesome if that is a deciding factor on if you like a wing. Otherwise the pizza is thin crust and pretty good, I am just a thick crust person in that regard."}
{"text":"Love this place! Saw them while I was driving by and stopped. Nice guys and good reasonably priced food. It just so happened I ordered from them three more times that week. Give these guys a shot!"}
{"text":"After waiting over an hour for delivery they called to say there were out of zucchini. They could have told us at the time of the order. Poor communication, poor planning. Don't wait an hour for your delivery only to be called at the time of the supposed delivery to be told they are out of food."}
{"text":"nice. They delivered late at night after a football game and it was tasty! thanks Zio!"}
{"text":"More tasty food, great service, and fresh product here a few nights ago.   We ate in and had another great experience. After reading some recent Yelp reviews, I was worried that our favorite small pizza place might have gone downhill, but it's as good as ever.   We ate rolls (mushroom and onion) and Zio's Favorite pizza. Both were great and we were glad for it.   Thanks, Zio's brothers! Keep on making great food and providing friendly service!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it came about 30 minutes early which was awesome. Sandwich was really good and still hot. French fries where still crispy and hot.  I always worry if I'm going to get limp cold fries delivered. Not the case here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered Zios pizza for vday because she got off late and that was the only thing open. We ordered cheesecake 10 mins later they call back saying they don't have it so I wanted a brownie instead also didn't have that, fries was very cold & half full I'm very disappointed I was so excited about the extended hours but that dose you no good if the food is shit."}
{"text":"Ok pizza. Good wings. They forgot my cheesecake and canollis, when I called..they said the next time we order we will get them for free. But, I won't be ordering next time because it was just ok. So I never got the money for those refunded..technically, that wouldn't be for free..right?"}
{"text":"This pizzeria  is a decent tucked away spot located in Mesa.  The first time I ordered from here i got the best impression of what kind of food they served. Amazing home style made mozzarella sticks,  New-York styled pizzas,epic garlic knots and hot wings that rated 7/10.  Delivery time was your average 30-45 minute wait.  Food was good enough to make me order for a second time. However,  this time had to make a personal visit to see what the place looked like.  Big glass windows,looked real clean inside and well maintained.  The place was moderately spacious too. The staff were real open and friendly. Nothing but good vibes.   Keep up the good work guys!   Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place after we went to see the temple lights! The white pizza and hot wings were amazing! The pepperoni and sausage were ok. I like that they're open until 5am!"}
{"text":"the pizza and garlic cheese bread was epic, it was quick, friendly, and amazing"}
{"text":"Solid New-York-style pizza. Cheese was spot-on (not that waxy, tasteless part-skim stuff you get at a lot of places). I could've gone for a little sweeter sauce but my husband loved it as is. Even the crust was great, with a nice hint of char on the bottom. If this were a good eat-in spot I'd give it five stars, but there was nobody eating in and very little indication (beyond a couple of empty tables with nothing but a tablecloth on them) that anybody ever does. Clearly a takeout & delivery joint, in a dingy little Mesa strip mall.   Still, excellent pizza. Having read all the negative reviews about the delivery, we went and picked it up ourselves. That was one blazing hot pizza right out of the oven in an old-school white pizza box just like I grew up with in New York. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the 20 piece wings to share  and they were very tasty! They have a very unique taste that I haven't tasted anywhere else! We chose fried boneless style wings with honey BBQ sauce. My only complaint is that the wings weren't tossed well with the honey BBQ sauce-- There were wings that didn't have sauce whatsoever. However, like I said earlier I ordered a 20 piece but they gave me about 25. So you win some and you loose some right? The service was above average for a pizza joint. I will definitely return to try a pizza!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, wings, and garlic knots! The garlic knots are HUGE! My boyfriend and I joked that they should actually be called garlic muffins because they're that big. Anyway, we ordered at 11pm on a Tuesday, got our order within the hour(!!) and really enjoyed everything. We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Average food, horrible service . The ONLY advantage this place has is the fact that it's still open and delivering after midnight while almost everywhere else is closed.   I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for some pepperoni and sausage pizza rolls ( I think that's what they're called ?) and an order of wings . The wait time was no big deal , since that's the time the told me when I ordered . The delivery guy kept calling me & yelling at me because he couldn't find my apartment number . the prick hung up on me twice .  So overall it took about two hours for my food to get here and the food was OKAY. The prices are pretty good , the food was average, but the service makes this place not worth going to or ordering from ."}
{"text":"So it's 1:00am, I'm restless, hungry, upset with my circumstances...Ahh Pizza will make me feel better.  I know Zio's is open til 5am, so I place an online order, says it will be ready in 15 minutes, and sure enough it was definitely hot and ready when I arrived to pick it up.  I was greeted by a cool, friendly guy at the counter, paid my tab and was on my way.  I managed to scarf down two pieces before I got home.  Nothing fancy or extraordinary about this pie, just good, simple and on point.  $10 less and twice as good as the pizza I had at a higher end Scottsdale Establishment over the weekend.  This place hits the spot for fresh late night munchies.  I genuinely appreciate the prompt service and warm greeting!"}
{"text":"just got back from ny never got back with u guys 2 let u know that zios contacted me n bent over backwards n made things right. i do believe i owe there employer n apology. its not wat im saying but how i say it n so om deeply sorry i cud have been a little more lady like.....lol im hugray sure hope im not on the hit listn u will except my apology n take my order pizon"}
{"text":"We originally found this place throwing a pizza party at work. Isn't worth the price, food isn't all that great. Really not fond of this place because we also have learned they litter their menus all over our apartment complex. We won't return to buy here."}
{"text":"Just received an add in the paper for this restaurant and plan on ordering this Sunday. First, I called for delivery and in the middle of talking he put me on hold. After a few minutes I hung up and called back, he apologized saying he is the only one there. I ordered a $60 order and was given a time for delivery. Five minutes later he called said they are all out of hamburgers??? I was rudely told \"what do you expect we are a busy restaurant?\" There was no apology or compensation for being out of food. He made it seem like it was a privilege to be ordering food from them. Needless to say, I cancelled my order and order from another restaurant for me and my family. I don't know how it is to dine there but if this how they treat people ordering food over the phone then I'm glad I didn't waste gas or money to their establishment."}
{"text":"What a great company. The food is delicious and the staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner.  Must try pizza joint in a small strip mall.  This pie is as close to New York style as you can get. Large 2 topping runs a little over $18 and is well worth it!  Clean restaurant with a friendly staff.  Check them out.  Will be back.  Support local businesses!!"}
{"text":"Give them a shot! Tried them out for the first time and so glad I did! Pizza and garlic knots were amazing. Prices were fair, delivery was early, pizza was huge (14\" is a small!) two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I felt a need to warn people about how awful this places food is. The spaghetti & pizza are bland and terrible the best thing they have was their cheesy bread and that was still worse than any other places I've ever had. This place is garbage. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Yes to the Roni Rolls..a great unique combination of Pizza dough, cheese and pepperoni. Somehow, despite these three simple ingredients, these towers are built like a castle and are new to my mouth and world. This is a place I found using Yelp, but it is in a small strip mall in Mesa (was in the area on a miserable date) next to the good ole liquor store. The rolls did take like 30 minutes plus from call in to the extra ten minutes I waited while they finished cooking. An order of five was $6.37 and they include two marinara cups for dipping of which you will need both. Counter guy said I would love the rolls of which they are famous for and I agree. Will be back somehow, sometime."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Slow service, food was not very tasty.  The wings were dry and the sauce was too watery.  I had a cheeseburger and it was similarly bland, and not very good.  My son had a pepperoni pizza and it was not bad, but certainly nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Ordered food on a Wednesday for a future delivery at 7 p.m. food showed up at 6 and we also had part of our order missing. Not only was part of it missing but our food was cold. Called and spoke with the \"manager on duty\" told him I wanted a refund for what wasn't delivered and wanted the tip taken off. He says yeah no problem I'll get that done for you and send you a confirmation email. A week later I still haven't received anything I called spoke with the same manager. Tells me he has to talk to his supervisor and that he'll contact me. It's now been over 2 weeks I never got my refund or even a phone. I definitely won't be going back. I stopped caring about my refund a week after I didn't receive it, but at least they could have handled the situation better. They clearly don't care about keeping customers."}
{"text":"This new pizza place just opened up, and they left a flier on my door. I decided to call in on one of the specials they were having for a large pizza and 20 wings. The pizza arrived quickly (about 30-40 minutes as promised) and it tasted great! The prices are fair and they give you a lot of food. The slices are huge and I had leftovers for a few days after!   The second time I ordered from them, I'm not sue what changed, but the pizza seemed a lot oilier. The cheese seemed to be really saturated in the oils, so I wasn't super impressed the second time around. The leftovers ended up sitting in the fridge until I threw them out.  I will probably order from them again (perhaps the second order was a fluke) and I will probably try the cheesy bread that was recommended in a previous review of this place.  Fairly priced, friendly staff, fair-good quality food and conveniently delivers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Zio's pizza. We usually get the pepperoni pizza and the garlic knots. Seriously the best pizza on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Simple Review:  3.5 Star Pizza: Thin chewy crust w/ decent sauce and topping distribution. I choose Zio's Favorite with spinach, tomato, and feta cheese.   3.5 Star Dinner Salad: Fresh greens and toppings, good balsamic dressing.    4 Star Overall: This is my new go to late night pizza place. Food seems homemade and is made with care which gives it a small edge over Howie's and makes it a better option then Gus's when you don't need beer delivery."}
{"text":"This place is great, we probably eat here at least twice a month. Their pizza is awesome, but by far my favorite thing there is their peanut butter cookies."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it! Made quick & hot! Seasoned nicely & not TOTALLY HEAVY on the bread/crust. Wings are exceptional! Love the gold wings & medium wings. Owner Nico is ALWAYS aiming to please. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We were excited to get some wings and pizza from this place because we heard it was really good. I have a hard time writing bad reviews about restaurants only because I grew up in one, and sometimes we weren't prefect. But I felt the need to write something about my delivery experience here. I'm okay with waiting up to an hour for delivery. But almost two? That's ridiculous. On top of that we live down the street from this place so I would have expected it to be tops 50 minutes. Maybe I am to blame for not picking up the pizza myself but I paid for the delivery charges and tipped as well so I figured I should have at least had decent service. When we got finally got the wings and pizza it was COLD!!!!!!!! That's the worst. I think that this place has a lot of potential to be great. We ate the pizza and wings and thought it was good for being cold. But again I'd like to emphasize I didn't order COLD food. I hope that maybe they take what I've written here into account about their delivery service. I'd like to try them again but at $40 bucks for a large pie and some wings, it's an expensive trial run."}
{"text":"I am hoping this was just an uncharacteristically bad night, because my experience does not align with the raves about the food and service.  I am only writing a review because I was urged to by our delivery driver.  The facts: I requested in the GrubHub \"Special Instructions\" section to use the side door and bring Parmesan and red pepper flakes (I have a photo of my confirmation screen). It took over an hour for the pizza and wings to arrive. The driver went to the front door and had no cheese or pepper.  He then told me he didn't get the instructions, and he was late because he had just \"...argued with a lady for ten minutes about what kind of sauce she got...\"  I asked if our food was still hot.  He replied that it was \"plenty hot\", it was not.  I asked if he had any condiments in his car .  He said he was \"not allowed\" to carry any cheese or pepper.  (That is when I told him I would Yelp about that and he said \"You should!\") I put the pizza in the oven to reheat it and it was so under-cooked the dough seeped through the grate and fell in globs.  I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager who agreed to refund my money through GrubHub (as it is the weekend, I won't know if this happened for a few days).  As of now, I am satisfied with how he handled it.  I ate one piece of pizza due to my extreme hunger, the sausage tastes like hamburger to me and the toppings were very unevenly scattered.  I woke up in the middle of the night sick to my stomach.  I can't say it was the pizza that did it, but it was the last thing I ate yesterday.    I really wanted to like this place, my family loves neighborhood restaurants and especially ones with pizza and wings and delivery, but I don't think I will risk ordering from this place again, even if this was just an off night.  :(  My money was successfully refunded.  I am grateful management is professional."}
{"text":"Tried ordering on grub hub and my order was supposed to get here in an hour and a half. I was ok with that as I have ordered from them before and it took this long. I get a text from a \"Melanie\" that said my order was cancelled because of road closures. Brown was closed this morning because of the Phoenix marathon and it is definitely open as of now. The race started at 645AM and the first 10K was the first marker near my house which would have been re opened by at the latest 10AM. The fact that the driver either looked up the route and didn't want to try and get it to me or that the only way they came was blocked and they didn't want to find an alternate route around them is beyond me. I had an extra $10 cash to give the driver on top of the 20% tip I left on the CC. Bottom line it's about the customer and I waited an entire hour for my wings and they could've called me right when I placed the order and told me it wasn't going to ha"}
{"text":"Thid place makes fhe best pizza ever! The crust isnt too thick,its perfect. They put the right amount of ingredients they have really good customer service here also! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The wings were ok, but the pizza was a joke, the sauce was fine but the amount of cheese and toppings on the whole pizza should have been on one slice. My friend also got a ham sub, there was ONE THIN SLICE of ham, and no cheese, but PLENTY of lettuce and onion.  Needless to say we won't be ordering from here again, extreme disappointment."}
{"text":"This place isn't the worst pizza place I've been to. The portions are good and it's inexpensive. But that brings me to the worst thing about it. It's just...average. The pizza tastes bland and uninspiring. You get what you pay for, I suppose."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. BBQ Burger. Burger was better than expected and was exactly what I had been hoping for. Fries were marginal but acceptable considering it was delivery. Fair price. They did not include a napkin or ketchup which was kind of not cool."}
{"text":"this was my first time ordering. it was a 130am delivery of pizza and a salad. delivery was exactly on time. i happen to not pay attention to the amount of money i handed the delivery guy. about 1 min after closing the door, i heard a gentle knock on my door. i accidently gave $20 extra. he showed me that i had given him $20 too much. i would have never noticed my mistake. i want to say thank you and i will be a repeat customer because of his honesty. great guy which only tells me that he works for a good boss. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is the best i found since I've moved to Arizona. I moved from the east coast and i give it a 5 star rating. There open late which is great with my work schedule. Even on my days off i order for dinner (that's how good they are). We always get the suicide wings and cheesey bread sticks with jalapenos and its the best. Have gotten onion rings; were still crispy when they got here and just ordered a pizza for the first time and was amazing, cant compare to anything I've had in Arizona. If you want good food especially late night order here."}
{"text":"This place had awesome pizza and wings!  While the area may be a transitional area, the staff are super friendly and the service is prompt for pickup. They have really great prices considering the size of the pizzas and everything tastes fresh.  Open till 5am! Easily one of the best pizza joints in the valley!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place in west Mesa/east Tempe area, and beyond. The dough is just the right thickness and the sauce is delicious. They have a 32\" party pizza. The subs are toasted and use good ingredients. Their \"Flaming Philly\" has a chipotle sauce that makes it one of the best sandwiches in AZ. Great burgers, too.  It's a family owned and ran business and they have great service. I see a lot of bad reviews with people complaining about food taking an hour or more - but that is pretty standard, especially during a dinner rush, to have food delivered to your door. Being open til 5am is pretty awesome, also."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, first time was mouth SMACKING good, second time around... not so much.  Garlic bread was so yummy, I don't recommend their wings, pizza, well depends I guess. The smaller pizzas are well made, the larger pizzas (greater than \"16) are kind of mediocre."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. What a nice place to eat.  I highly the come d the pizza. It's the best I have had in awhile."}
{"text":"I mean...its alriiiiight, but that's about it. I wanted to love this place because it's pretty cheap. But alas, the age old adage of \"you get what you pay for\" rings true.   Cheap pizza, ok pizza...done and done."}
{"text":"This place is good. Everywhere else was closed and these guys are open for delivery until 5am. The pizza was decent-average, the medium wings were really good and the garlic knots were fantastic. Fairly prompt delivery time and the delivery guy at 4am seemed cool. I would definitely drunkenly order from them again."}
{"text":"Im new to town and was looking for a good pizzeria. Sadly this was not the right choice. The pricing is good. And there hours are great for college students I ordered a 14\" pizza and they said 45 mins to an hour.. thats fine but when it got here my pizza was ice cold.. if you need more drivers to get the food to places hot then do it.. this was a waste of money. Cold pizza. And barely any toppings. Needless to say I wont be giving them my business again"}
{"text":"Love geting from this place. Found it a few weeks ago. New york style pizza like my mama mia used to make!!! Deff recomended"}
{"text":"We had this a while ago. The pizza was average. It tasted better than costco but this is far from gourmet. This does not stack up with other 4 star ratings I've tasted in the past.   The price is most definitely more than a single dollar sign. It should be changed to $$."}
{"text":"Skip this place. We ordered boneless wings and fries delivered. They used frozen chicken nuggets that were so tough I had to check if they were gristle. I ordered honey hot sauce but they drenched the wings in regular buffalo sauce. The fries had that \"old grease\" smell. With delivery & tax we pd $30 for this. Very disappointing. Our dog liked it."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews on here and were a bit worried, but I figured what the hell why not give them a shot myself. They kept putting flyers on our door, so we ordered actually just last night. My husband got the meatball sub and I got the antipasto salad, the sauce they used was very good, the meatballs were delicious! The bread was perfect! My salad was huge! with lots of the fixings that come with an antipasto. even the dressing was good, none of that kraft garbage. I would recommend to give them a shot."}
{"text":"I come here for the pizza slices. I love this place. You can come at any time and they will make you a fresh pizza slice. It's perfect when you don't want to order a whole pizza or if you are like me, counting calories and can't justify eating a while pizza lol. The pizza slice is thin New York style. It's good pizza for the price. Not the best, definitely not bad. Also, it's surprisingly clean on the inside. They pay attention to their restaraunt and keep the bathrooms clean."}
{"text":"A pizza joint that's open till 5 AM gets at least four stars. But these guys actually have some decent slices. And the place is actually clean. I just went with the cheese since it was fresh and it was a pleasant surprise. Looking forward to venture deeper into the menu  next time. Seriously though, Mesa Arizona 5 AM pizza are you kidding me??? This is my new favorite place. #respek"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza spot! Their pizza is amazing and their garlic knots are to die for!! This is my fourth time having them and it just keeps getting better. :-)"}
{"text":"Great wings and pizza rolls and the breadsticks are amazing, some of the best breadsticks I've ever had. Especially with local delivery. Only thing bad I would say about this place is sometimes delivery time can be longer than average. Also the medium wings are pretty hot (which I like) but just an FYI for anyone who has kids or are sensitive to spicy things."}
{"text":"Customer service here is great. The food is good. The steak fries are my favorite quick fix and the calzones are freaking awesome."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint!  Not a 4 star restaurant but they are a 4 star pizza place. And they deliver! Kids meal was big enough for my girls. Pizza was quite good. A little more attention could have been paid to placement but hey it's pizza move it around yourself right? The little pizza \"muffins\" were delicious. The meatball sub is a reorder as well. We will become regulars I'm sure their menu is diverse and did I mention they deliver?"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here last night. Had no idea about the location but found it through the EAT24 app while looking for a late night pizza place. All the other pizza places nearby close around 11, right when I was looking to order. Other reviews seemed decent so I went for it.   One 14\" pizza and 10 wings.  Price was reasonable and the delivery time was too, 45 minutes to an hour. Using the EAT24 app made paying easy too, everything went through PayPal.   Had ordered the Zio's Favorite Pizza. Half the pizza was under cooked and the other half was crispy. The spinach on the pizza seemed like it was out of a frozen spinach bag you get at the grocery store and there was very small amounts of feta cheese sprinkled in several spots.   The 10 wings I ordered were soggy, almost like they were steamed, not a bit of crunch to the skin or any sign that they were baked or fried. The Hot sauce had a good flavor to it though, making it the best part of the wing order.   Overall the experience was disappointing. Less than decent pizza and flat out gross wings. The convenience of Zio's being open late might get them some good business, but their food isn't helping them keep the business. Wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. The customer service was awful. He said it would be 55-60 mins til delivery. I placed a simple order. Wings, garlic knots and a Greek salad. It was an hour and a half. (This was in the middle of the day.) The wings were still halfway frozen, tasted old and were dry. Typically they come with carrot sticks or celery but there was none. The garlic knots were dry and over cooked and had way too much Parmesan seasoning. The salad was wilted so I had to throw it out. Greek dressing was great."}
{"text":"good white pizza and open untill like 4 in the morning? this is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"I loved it!  Ordered it from Eat24.  I love leftover take out so I ordered a supreme pizza, wings and a ham & provolone sandwich to share.  A half hour later it was delivered, all piping hot.  I ate half of the amazingly delicious sandwich and was full.  I did try the pizza and wings and they were good too but I am going to dream about that sammy...nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Since my last review Zio has really stepped their game up. Best pizza and wings around. Extremely fair pricing, and the skinny dude that works at the front counter is extremely friendly and helpful. I will be a customer for life from here on out. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Best Hot wings I've had thus far for delivery! Ice ordered several times from this location...they always come on time, give me the best quality and provide just what I asked for ! A+"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to order a quick pizza. Took longer than I thought, but the pizza was pretty good! Little arcade in the back to keep the kids busy."}
{"text":"32 inch New York pizza well made with toppings correct. Filled 6 hungry people easily with spare slices."}
{"text":"We just ordered pizza from Zio's for the first time this evening. We got a menu in the mail and decided to give them a try since they're in the neighborhood. We were not disappointed. We got Garlic Knots, a Zion Supreme, and some fried mushrooms. The delivery was faster than expected by about 15 minutes and everything was great! The pizza is some of the best I've had in a long time and the fried mushrooms were good without being too greasy. All in all, we are very satisfied and will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it every time I order it. Everything tastes perfect!! I haven't got to try everything yet but what I have tried is amazing. Will definitely keep ordering whenever I can! :D"}
{"text":"Zio's is the best pizza I've had in Arizona. I ordered a white pie and cannoli pretty late at night for takeout. It was there when we got their for pickup. The pizza was the closest NYC pizza I've found in Arizona and seriously amazing. My only complaint is that the menu says that the white pie has marinara but it didn't which is fine because I prefer my white with white sauce but that could be misleading. The cannoli was also some of the best I've had but pretty over priced ($3.99 for 3 small 3 inch cannolis). We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Zio's! This is my family's favorite place to go eat! It tough enough getting the teenagers to go anywhere with us but this place is an exception.  We love everything on the menu and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the bad reviews, we have been dinning in and getting delivery from here for the past year and have never had a bad experience...we also don't order cheeseburgers from a pizza place, but hey, to each their own, right? The food is great if you're looking for no frills pizza and wings, the fried zucchini and knots are good too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have had in Arizona. Kind of a shady area. I always get a pizza with garlic, tomatoes, spinach, ricotta and salami. Also they are open till 5am. They're within walking distance of the new Club Red, so it's a good place to eat at after a concert.  I have yet to try the wings but the gold wings sound delicious."}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for four years and love the New York Style pizza, with huge floppy pieces.  Zio's is the closest I've found in the area to that style of pizza.  And they're open until 4am.  So it's great late-night, bars-are-now-closed food.  You can get delivery, but it takes an hour (even though I live 0.1 miles from their store).  I would recommend pick up.  The garlic knots are worth getting as well, they are greasy and doughy and delicious.  You can dine in, but the pizza ovens make it a little warmer than I like and there are only hard seats so it's not super comfortable.  Zio's is a great place to get pizzas for parties or late night drunk food.  Do it."}
{"text":"Wanted to order to go service. I was put on hold over 3 times before I made an order. No apology was given. Was calling to order the \"Facebook\" special $10.00 for xlarge 1 topping pizza. The worker who answered the phone had no idea what I was ordering. Told her to check with Zio's Facebook. She rudely replied \"I have no Facebook\" Shouldn't matter if she has Facebook, the company she works for does."}
{"text":"Placed my order late in the evening asked for a phone call so as not to wake my roommate. What does the guy do but ring the doorbell at 1215am. Pizza was suppose to take max of 45 minutes to be delivered took over an hour, which is ridiculous since I live less than 2 blocks from this establishment. Pizza wasn't hot nor did it have very many toppings on it. I tried calling to check on my order and had no answer. This was my first and last experience with this place. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before for their sampler platter and have liked it, but have never had the pizza. I decided to try it out. The place is clean and not really busy for a Friday night. The staff was very nice and they told me I had a 15 minute wait for the pizza. The pizza I ordered to go was the chicken rustic. When I got home there was hardly any chicken on it and it was really bland."}
{"text":"Zio's pizza is MOTHA FUCKIN DELICIOOOOOUS!!!!  I had the Zio's favorite which consist of spinach, tomato, garlic, and feta cheese...GET SOME"}
{"text":"They got my order right, the service was fine, but the food was inedible. Ive tried their wings, pizza and even a sandwich. I hate going through Pizza Hut or dominoes because I prefer mom and pop places, but this one isn't worth it.. I would advise against going here."}
{"text":"Their pizza rolls are to die for! We get delivery from here once a week. The only downside is delivery usually takes 45mins at least..... I suppose it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"This is a brand new place that delivers to my house. Tried them tonight for the first time. I ordered a small (14\" - pretty big actually) pizza with pepperoni and sausage, and some garlic cheese bread. The cheese bread was similar to Papa Johns in flavor, but somehow better. The pizza was pretty delicious - flavorful pepperoni, small italian sausage pieces (but plenty of them), the cheese was good and there was a generous amount of it... sauce and crust were good. I mean, it's pizza.   I've decided that I just like pizza a lot - this might explain why I give so many positive reviews of pizza places. I just like being able to summon food to my door and it's still hot and tasty. I also like to support local businesses. The food here is good, and the prices are low, they deliver fast, and they're nice on the phone. This is a solid choice - and I think they are open super late.  I'm told they are going to have online ordering soon, but it doesn't look like their website is up yet."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, some wings, and some veggie rolls at 6:24 pm. I was told it would be 45 minutes to 1 hour. That is a long time for a pizza joint that does this regularly but I figured maybe they were busy. At 7:40 I called and was told they got busy and he would be there within 5 minutes. My food did not arrive until 8:01 pm. It was ice cold and when I told the driver that he said yea well it took a long time. No one has even tried to fix this. not the driver, or the supposed supervisor on the phone. I will never order from here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I'll never crave another pizza the way I crave these.  I love this place. The food is incredible & always satisfying for my family & I. We're HUGE fans of their soft pizza crust. The workers are also very polite & always make sure we are clear on the ingredients of my order. I also love that they put a good amount of work into making my food. They've never given me just some slapped together pizza, & the best part is... THEYRE OPEN UNTIL 5AM. Perfect for a late night or early morning meal. These employees really seem like they care & always succeed in giving me & my family a dinner we all can enjoy. Thank you Zio's!"}
{"text":"I love zio's, I would honestly order from them several times a week (and I've done this before) if I could afford to. The loaded fries and the wings are my favorites, but I was really blown away by their calzones and burgers! I have never had a bad experience with them. my only suggestion would be a rewards program so that regulars like me could enjoy a free meal every once in a while :)"}
{"text":"I love Zio's!! Always amazing food and they're always so nice. My order has never been wrong and they're service is really fast! Love it here!! You will not be disappointed. The pizza is amazing and ingredients are always fresh! I've read the bad reviews and here and I'm really surprised because I've never had a bad experience. The hours are amazing too since my schedule is different from others and  up late. I'll continue going here they're good is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I placed a simple order for an order of their sausage and pepper rolls with some jalapeno poppers. I was told it would be an hour, so I check an hour later and grubhub shows it left 15 mins ago. I figure I should be getting it any time now. Then another 20 mins passes and I call the restaurant and ask where it is, the manager calls the driver and says he is 5 minutes away. 10 minutes later it gets here and is stone cold. Very disappointing after I tried them a couple weeks back."}
{"text":"seriously delicious food I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza and wings, but I had the best honey BBQ & pineapple/jalepeño pizza last night"}
{"text":"Didn't have any problems with delivery times like others had mentioned. Just got a large pepperoni pizza and 10 wings. Pizza isn't bad, great cheese. Crust tasted a little cardboardy but didn't really affect the overall taste. I thought the pizza was pretty good, I'm mean I ate just about tho whole thing in one sitting. The wings are average, I can get better wings at a Philly place right around the corner. I don't think I got the $5 deal on a one topping large as pictured but I paid what you'd probably expect. Not really a first choice place, but if it's late night this place will definitely hit the spot and satisfy. They use a good ranch as well, which is very important ;) Keep this place in mind if you happen to crave pizza late at night, you and your friends will probably devour it."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a local pizza place that delivered and I found the listing for Zio's. Encouraged by the 4 1/2 star reviews I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered their Supreme Pizza with Medium Hot Wings and an order of Fried Mushrooms.  Overall the food was in the decent to good range, but I was expecting something more with the higher than average ratings. There was nothing wrong with the food I ordered, it was just incredibly average.  Nothing fantastic here."}
{"text":"I moved to the area within the last year and my g/f and I have eaten here 4 times.  I guess it's safe to say we really like it.  We generally order the Zio's Supreme and cheese bread.  I love the size of their slices for their pies and the cheese bread is hands down the best we've had.  I come from a small town with a couple mom and pop places and this is easily as good as theirs.  My g/f just tried the Gyro Pita this last time and liked it.  Only complaint I've had thus far was no tomatoes on my cheese bread this last time like I ordered.  Still this place is amazing and it's open until 5am!"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience, awesome customer service and fair prices! Can't wait to try a gyro sometime!"}
{"text":"Fast service, freshly made, great prices. Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. They're open til 5am which is extremely convinient. Def worth trying!"}
{"text":"Ordered around 9am on a Saturday (Only pizza place open this early). It took them 45 minutes to deliver which is what they promised. The food was a pleasant surprise. I would of rated them 5 stars but they brought me fried mushrooms instead of zuccini, which is what I ordered. I would definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I have had pizza, garlic knots, and their peperoni rolls a few times. This is probably the closest non major chain pizza place to my house. The staff are all very nice although their delivery takes a long time for as close as I live (Less than one mile from their store front). The food is always very good. Not the best but WAY better then any major chain pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. Arrived quickly, food was hot and nothing forgotten!   Unfortunately the sandwich ordered was overly covered in marinara sauce and ruined it, making the entire sandwich soggy and unappetizing. The veggie pizza was okay, standard veggie pizza but had an odd wet cardboard smell. The wings were yummy and cooked just fine. Unsure if I'll order delivery again from here but the price was fair."}
