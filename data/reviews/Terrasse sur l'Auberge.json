{"text":"This Roof top is made for day drinking, great spot! Great view of the river and surrounding Montreal. This was the best place for day drinking we found in Montreal. Service can be slow if they're slammed, but servers were cool, we came here with a bachelor party. Cocktails and beers were solid."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice outdoor terrace on a lovely Saturday afternoon and based on the reviews came to Terrasse sur l'Auberge. If you are coming for drinks, 3 of 5 stars; the view, 5 of 5; food, 1 of 5. The rooftop is a bit crowded, staff was average. They don't have much of a food selection even though the menu is \"tapas\"... our steak was well done (not by request), chewy, and not flavorful - we didn't finish it. For reference: I'm from the States, travel frequently, and eat out at least 4 times/week."}
{"text":"The rooftop bar in the Auberge du vieux port has just opened last week. There are currently only small Tapas on the menu but the wines are fine and the service is very helpful and friendly.
In addition you get excellent views of the St. Lawrence stream and the harbour and the city. Very nice for sundowners."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order for a beer and a glass of wine. Not rocket science. Waited another 15 and gave up. Walked out right behind another couple equally frustrated by not just poor service but complete lack of service."}
{"text":"Difficult place to find but worth the search because of the view. The view is really nice but that is all. We ordered 4 pitchers of sangrias for the 4 of us (the sangrias were really weak). The service is slow. We had to order the next pitcher when the waiter brought the current pitcher so that by the time we finished the sangria the next one would arrive just in time. We order some appetizers and they were nothing special. We shared a platter of dips and a charcuterie (nothing exciting to brag about). Also, the sangrias were really expensive. You are better off going somewhere for drinks and food before coming here to enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Came here for after dinner drinks on Saturday evening of the Labour Day weekend. We were just walking along St. Paul when we happened upon a sign directing us to the best view of Old Montreal. A series of signs led us to a back door of Taverne Gaspar and through to the lobby of the Auberge du Vieux Port. A short elevator ride later and we found ourselves on the rooftop terrasse, where we were treated to a stunning panoramic view of Old Montreal and the St. Lawrence while we sipped on our (predictably overpriced) drinks. Price-aside though, the drinks (we ordered several of the sangrias) were excellent. My favourite was the bubbly sangria  (mousseux, Pineau des Charentes, white cranberry juice), which was unique, strong, and beautifully presented.

Bottom line: An awesome place to spend a evening with friends."}
{"text":"Ma terrasse préférée, car le service est toujours chaleureux! La sangria et la vue font en sorte que c'est la place parfaite pour se détendre lors d'une soirée d'été! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service lent, désagréable.
Ne commandez pas de cocktails, prix excessif, et mauvaise qualité.
Si la vue est agréable, elle ne justifie certainement pas les prix pratiqués ici."}
{"text":"Beautiful views of the city. Came here for drinks only to capture the view and it is beautiful.  There is not much of a party crowd since everyone here seems to be a tourist but highly recommend it for drinks.  Staff is used to turnover so you will get in and out as quickly as you want."}
{"text":"La terrasse sur le toit est vraiment extra, avec une super vue et une excellente ambiance, musique et beau monde garantis!
Les drinks sont un peu chères quand même (9$ la biere, 10-15 le verre de vin et 12 le verre de sangria) mais c'est le prix à payer pour l'endroit..
Il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix de bouffe, mais tous les plats que j'ai vus et sentis avaient l'air très bons!! :)
Pas de réservation possible, il y a généralement une line up mais ça va assez vite..
A essayer pour un verre en 5@7 ou plus tard.."}
{"text":"Came in for a drink with a view. Did not disappoint. The food menu is simple and limited. Although Yelp says it's a tapas bar the food is mostly salads and paninis. Definitely on the lighter side. The food we ordered was tasty and fresh. 

Wine list was also a little limited but we easily found a bottle to drink at sunset. Service was friendly and prompt. I'd definitely return for another evening."}
{"text":"OK so I have been these four tresses Nelligan, William Gray, Place D'Armes, and Sur L'Auberge. 
They are all within 5min walk of each other and all almost the same, I wonder if they are operated by the same company? 
Here is my dilemma, the settings are great for all of them nice view and good ambiance, the food and drinks however severely lacking especially for the price! So I am ranking Neligan as the best (4 stars) - best drinks and ambiance! The other 3 all get three stars because...15 dollars a drink and it tastes like they poured a premade cocktail mix... and the food is very lacking $20 dollar lobster role on a chewy dry hot dog bun with little scraps of lobster claw! Although I should say that the drinks and bartender quality is better at Neligan and so is the ambiance!
I will post the same review for all four places."}
{"text":"We came here on our weekend trip to Montreal. We really stopped for some drinks and it had a great view of the Vieux Port. I can't say much about the food since we really just had drinks. But the only hiccup was when we asked to move to another table before we ordered and was told that the restaurant policy ask that we not move once seated to avoid issues, which we said ok to. Then two seconds later the couple next to us moved to the very same table and we were told that since we did not insist they got the table......WHAT?!? but any way we let it go we were on our little getaway and was not about to start any issue with that. Well needless to say the couple changed their mind and left so we moved to that table. Tip to management: be consistent."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view, less than average drinks. $29 for two Moscow mules -- too sweet, not well balanced. Loved the view from the top and our server was quick and quite nice, but the prices were too high for the product. Probably would grab a drink in Gaspar over this place the next time."}
{"text":"Atop of Auberge Vieux Port is a wonderful terrace with a spectacular view of Old Montreal and its Port.  We had been here a few years ago and were blown away by a White Sangria we were served using white wine, lychee and white cranberry juice.  We returned this year and were hoping for a repeat enjoyment.

Yes, they still offered a White Sangria, but it was prepared differently (insert sad face here).  But wait, there's more!  There was now a Clear Sangria on the menu that was made with Prosecco, white cranberry juice, and peach Schnapps.  Just had to try this!  We ordered a pitcher ($50) and some food.  The Clear Sangria was fantastic (insert happy face here).

Since we were sharing the Sangria we also shared the Grilled Cheese Canard ($18) and Tartare de Crevettes ($26).  The duck grilled cheese was delicious and came with chips and some salad. The shrimp tartare was fresh, tasty, and came with some toasted baguette slices and more of the salad that was with the grilled cheese.

It can get a little cramped with everyone wanting to be on the roof on a beautiful day.  Our server, Marie Noel, took excellent care of us.  Our water and sangria glasses were kept filled throughout our stay.

As a final note, we found out just a little too late, that the terrace at the hotel we actually were staying at, The Nelligan, a sister hotel of Auberge Vieux Port, was serving a White Sangria with lychee!  Oh well, next trip!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas mangé, je ne peux donc pas donner mon avis sur la nourriture, mais l'endroit est génial pour apprécier le Vieux-Port dans toute sa splendeur! Étant enceinte, j'ai pris un cocktail sans alcool et il était délicieux! Bonne carte des vins et de drinks aussi!

Le seul petit hic (mais c'est comme ça partout dans le Vieux), les prix sont très élevés!"}
{"text":"This is the roof top terrace with the MOST BEAUTIFUL views of Old Montreal, its port, the majestic river and surroundings!!! 

I wish I can give the bar four stars out of six. The drinks were not very consistent. The first round of sangrias was not as strong as I would like it, besides the fact the white wine sangria with orange juice was a little bit strange combination, but that was my choice in the end. Second round of drinks was much stronger, the clear sangria was definitely a better choice as well as the mojito royal. There is a nice choice of snacks and some main course options on the menu, we shared the cheese platter that was not very big, but enough for two. I wish we were told what are the Quebec cheeses we had, not that I normally remember them, but it gives a nice touch, particularly when you have so many tourists in the bar. Service was overall efficient and nice. 

This spot is absolutely perfect to watch the shows of the International Fireworks Fest. The owners know it and they charge an extra of 25 dollars if you stay after eight on a fireworks night. 

I would definitely recommend the bar to Montrealers and visitors because of the stunning views. Try to arrive before sunset, every moment is precious as the light changes. Just get a drink and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Another great rooftop patio! We had just gotten out of a bar and were walking around to try a different bar with a nice patio, when we saw this rooftop with lights so decided to check it out. We were pleasantly surprised when we got up there. A little bummed because we couldn't get a table on the side facing the river. The river view is very nice! But the other side view is not that bad. Plus the weather was just amazing that night so nevertheless we enjoyed our time there. If you like fruity Sangria, I recommend trying their melon sangria. Quite refreshing!"}
{"text":"The view from the rooftop is gorgeous ! We went to eat and drink but also watch the fireworks. Be prepared to pay $25 extra per person after 9pm ! If you don't mind the price then it is definitely worth checking out. It's romantic! For those on a budget,  it's pricy and the view of the fireworks is just as nice at the clock tower or elsewhere. They do play the music that goes with the fireworks so that's nice. If you go early enough do try to sit along the edge so that you can get a better view of the fireworks. Beware that the railing is filled with spiders and spider webs so don't get too close. I had the cucumber gin basil drink and the lobster roll. The lobster rolls were good. Instead of one big lobster roll it was two tiny buns. It came with homemade potato chips and salad. My friend had the duck confit grilled cheese with cheese , apple puree and spinach. It also came wit homemade potato chips and salad."}
{"text":"This terrace bar was a suggestion by our tour guide. And as she rightly said, not many people knew about this amazing roof top bar with a 180degree view of Downtown Montreal! The space was semi full and did not look crowded. 
Just that there are no menus here and no food options. Its a great place to chill with a couple of drinks and look at the amazing view!"}
{"text":"Most breathtaking view of old port. Truly a hidden gem. Great beverage selection, i had a delish red sangria. Next time would definitely like to give their food a try."}
{"text":"Meilleur vue du vieux port avec de petite sélection d'entrée et bonne sélection de boisson. Essayer un pichet sangria avec des amis et le beau soleil de l'êtes"}
{"text":"If you have to get to a terrace and you want to be able to see a 180 view of the city for 30 seconds while standing next to the people with the good view sitting at their table...go for it. 

But that's all it is unless you get one of the few tables with a good view. 

Service was quick and friendly but it was expensive and the soda I ordered was mostly ice. 

Overall not worth it."}
