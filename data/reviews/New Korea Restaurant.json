{"text":"Good enough for a food court standard. I always get the $6.99 pork bone soup.  Authentic Korean enough for me :)"}
{"text":"Decent korean food considering it is in a food court in a supermarket.   I ordered the jjampoong which was $10 including tax. Noodles were nice and chewy. Soup was spicy and hot. Made to order.   It came with a bit of kimchi and sweet potato banchan.   I would come back to order other dishes. Was impressed the first time around."}
{"text":"I was in a bit of a hurry so I thought a food court would be quick and cheery. The last time I came to this food court, the main store was T&T. Now it's Field Fresh. It looks the same, perhaps less crowded.  Anyway, there are few choices of vendors and I decided on a pork cutlet from New Korea. As expected, it didn't take long for my food to be prepared. I got a breaded and deep fried piece of pork over rice and vegetables, mostly onions, and a bowl of soup.   The pork was crispy and nice on the outside, tender on the inside. It was very thin and reminded me of schnitzel. There was a brown sauce on the pork that tasted familiar but I couldn't place it. It wasn't bad but may be a bit strong for some tastes.  Although this food court doesn't measure up anywhere close to my favourite food court at First Markham Place, I have no complaints about what I received. I'll probably drop in again the next time I'm hungry in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is a Korean fast food that makes mainly noodle and rice dishes.  It is located inside the food court of T&T Supermarket Milliken branch.  I have tried, in order of favourite to least, its spicy squid (comes with rice) ($8), jap chae ($5) and bibimbap ($7).  I list bibimbap the last because it is my favourite Korean dish, and I have eaten it in many restaurants and have an idea what it is supposed to taste like.  The version that New Korean serves tastes too bland.  The spicy squid packs punches of spiciness to the extent that I need the rice to tame the spiciness.  The squid is overcooked but I expect it from a food court booth.  The jap chae is a vegetarian dish, is big portion and has a nice sesame oil aroma.  It is a bit too soft, but it tastes okay nevertheless.  I find myself back to New Korea times and again for quick Korean bites, when I don't feel like paying a lot for it.  It is not high quality food, but it is authentic nevertheless.  The portion is always sufficient as a lunch."}
{"text":"I only recommend this place if you want a quick bite after grocery shopping at T&T. Tried the Bibimbap for $7 and it comes with a tiny plate of kimchi and a small bowl of miso soup. Pretty decent and quite filling. They give you one small container of red pepper paste sauce. I always ask for 2 sauce containers for my bibimbap. Good, healthy, cheap and quick food while grocery shopping. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"3.5 Pretty good for a food court stall. Comparable to restaurants and I would say... better than a lot of crappy restaurants out there. Although it's food court style, they still include one or two side dishes for you and the owner is very nice. The prices are fair and portions are the same as restaurants."}
{"text":"This place by far had the best pork bone soup and beef bone soup I have ever tasted at a Korean restaurant, and I miss it dearly. Tasty spicy and sweet kimchi, fluffy and warm white rice. Love was served with every meal. I gave them my number to contact me if they ever opened somewhere else. If anyone hears anything, I would love to know. I would travel to T&T just for this restaurant, not to grocery shop. It was amazing food, and now it's gone."}
{"text":"Mirak Korean Restaurant is located in the food court of T&T Middlefield and Steeles.  The menu here are really simple, with 10 permanent selections displayed in the lightbox with photos and a few hand written ones like Cold Noodles that changes depends on the season and availability.  The Korean lady that took my order is really nice and soft spoken. She is the one that took my order and prepared my food this early lunch time yes I was there for lunch at 11:15 am.  The Soft Tofu Soup ($6.99) requested extra spicy is quite good. Not as good as Tofu Village or Buk Chang Dong Soon. It is made seafood based with shrimps, fish and octopus with the egg cracked inside. It is A-OK and the tofu is quite silky.  The rice they served is white rice.. boo.... I hardly touch that. They only have Kimchi for banchen. The kimchi is not spicy at all...  -0.5 star  They accept cash only!"}
