{"text":"The tea was great, but the desserts were fantastic. I tried the raspberry mango cheesecake and blueberry buttermilk tart and they were absolute perfection. I'm a dessert person and these were the best homemade desserts I've ever had in the GTA or Toronto."}
{"text":"My friend and I had the High Tea. According to the menu, this meant salad and quiche, followed by scones, and an assortment of sandwiches and sweets. 

What we got:

Tea: was delicious and the only thing I wanted more of - and got more of! The girls steadily refill your pot. No complaints here. 

Salad: Drained mandarin oranges over soggy spring mix with radicchio, overdressed in a bottled creamy poppyseed dressing. In the age of Gwyneth Paltrow and all things kale and healthy and green, this salad should not exist.

No quiche arrived: honestly after the salad, I was okay with this. 

Sandwiches: the ubiquitous crustless cucumber sandwiches were another letdown. Soft white bread should not mean cheap, sliced white bread! These \"sadwiches\" were screaming for something seasoning! Salt?! Black pepper maybe?

The sweets: a sugar cookie, an overly sweet fudge topped with that coconut filling found in German chocolate cakes and a hazelnut meringue petit four

Atmosphere: Very crowded seating. Mixed crowd - a few very adorable elderly couples enjoying Sunday tea, contrasted with a lot more vapid girls dressed up to Instagram the crap out of not very good food.

Notes:
- Don't come here if you have a gluten allergy. Even if it's a mild one.
- High tea plus taxes and tip comes up to $28. The novelty of high tea in suburbia is alluring, but the quality of food here is not worth it.
- Reservations are a must
- The gift shop is worth a visit. It's crazy, spinster cat lady chic. I loved it."}
{"text":"I second the pros of the previous reviewer - the prices are decent and it's a cute place. The experience is what you come for and they deliver. The food is quite good as well; I usually share the \"Robinson-Bray Tea\" with a friend and the scones always warrant exclamations of deliciousness. The tea itself is yummy too. They never seem to have a problem refilling your teapots (though I've never seen them do it more than once), so you do get your money's worth.

I've never had much of a problem finding parking nearby, but it might be a different story on the weekends."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 5 on a Thursday lunchtime for high tea and we were a little late and added an extra person, but the staff were able to accommodate us! Our server was friendly despite all this, and described how the whole high tea process would work. 

We chose our teas from a large selection - I got the Caribbean Dreams (green tea with a light fruity taste) which I really enjoyed! We each got a starter salad with normal greens and strawberries and tangerines which had mixed reviews from all of us - all in all, nothing special. Two trays came out with the sandwiches and pastries; each individual gets 4 sandwiches (two cucumbers, an egg salad, and a chicken cranberry), a scone (we had the choice of plain or chocolate & strawberry), a mini spinach quiche, a sugar cookie, a coconut oat bar and a meringue puff pastry. The chocolate and strawberry scone was the fan favourite  of the day, and everything else was quite delicious as well! (although personally I didn't really enjoy the oat bar, while others did). Overall, it was surprisingly filling and it was a fun experience to eat little finger foods! The total came to around $26 including tax+tip. 

The atmosphere was really cute and cozy (it is a small place) and we enjoyed our first high tea experience here! Would recommend to ladies looking for a place to feel lady-like and British for a day!"}
{"text":"We book the table  at 4pm.  By the time when we arrived, a huge party is going on in the main room.  We wonder where are we going to sit.  The waitress leads us to another chamber of the house and there is oddly another table there.

We sit down and good not to be disturbed by the adjacent party.  We like to order the High Tea.  But maybe due to the huge party there, not any much is left and the kitchen is not going to make anything more.  We are forced to order scone and our  teas.   The scone is warm and the Devon cream on the scone tastes wonderful.  The loose leaves tea reminds us of the British tea flavor rather than these days conveniently enough to use tea bags.  I still have inventory of loose leaves teas from Britain and France.

My Mom enjoys the afternoon very much.  It is the time well spent"}
{"text":"I really loved the high tea at the the Tea Room. There was a great selection of tea to choose from, the tea sandwiches and deserts were wonderful, and the maple scone was awesome! I was by myself so almost got seated in the guest shop but asked to have tea in the dining room, which they quickly accommodated. 

The customer service was very good, the decor of the tea room was beautiful. I would highly recommend!

Tip: get reservations and come early to find parking."}
{"text":"Took my mother for High Tea this past weekend. I will say that the tea selection was great and we quite enjoyed it. The rest of our experience left something to be desired though..

When we arrived there was no hostess to great or seat us at our table. We had to wander into the tea room awkwardly, then back to the front and then back again until someone offered to seat us. Then we waited over 10 minutes at our table with no service or acknowledgement from staff. I eventually had to flag our waitress down.

We sat at a table for two that had a direct view into the kitchen. The staff didn't seem concerned about closing the doors to the kitchen, which really took away from the atmosphere. Though I am sure at least some of the food was made fresh, most of it was either being thrown in the microwave or coming out of a can/jar. Part of the appeal of 'high tea' is eating delicious, freshly prepped food...not jam out of a grocery store brand or nuked up food.

The place itself is cute and quaint but the slow service, non-fresh food and lack of separation of kitchen from our dining experience will definitely deter me from visiting again."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Lots of teas you can try. Also provide lunch. Good for meeting and chatting with friends."}
{"text":"It's a nice cozy place. They have good coffee and tea. We ordered English tea and was very tasty... scones are good but sandwiches were very small and not it was not enough... deserts in the platter were so small too... just a bit disappointed with their platter size...that's were they loos some stars..."}
{"text":"I've been to The Tea Room several times and find the quality of food consistently good. Their crab crepe is delicious as are their quiches."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday with my girls and it was my first time having high tea.  I don't think high tea is my thing but it was an overall cute experience.

We did the afternoon high tea pkg which gives you your tea of choice, salad, scones, mini sandwiches & quiches and mini desserts.  A variety of teas to choose from, maybe if I go back, I'll try there other food items.  The tower of sandwiches, quiches and dessert were okay, basic items. Oh and the apple scone was delicious!

I think high tea is more of a social experience that I might try again, just not my cup of tea lol

Service was great, friendly and polite staff."}
{"text":"Busy little tea room at the Robinson Bray. Its def a hidden gem tucked away in the midst of Streetsville. Make sure you make reservations because Ive walked in twice without one, and was told they were completely booked up. Its a small tea room but the place is full of character. My daughter loves it here, makes her feel like a princess. Great tea sandwiches and delightful selection of teas."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times.
Every time we've visited we are greeted with wonderful people. The workers who are always there remember us and it's great. We've had a wonderful time  - EVERY TIME. The tea is great. Their menu is wonderful. Especially the sweets and scones. 

They also change their menu according to the season.
For example when it was Fall - they had a wonderful pumpkin tea!

Over all it's a great experience. 
It is definitely not our last."}
{"text":"Lovely cozy place, marvellous to have some high teas and chat with friends. 

Better to make reservation at least one week in advance because it's very popular but not many tables."}
{"text":"Good selection of teas, excellent service.
Tables are rather small, which is fine for tea with scones, but may be tight if you order food."}
{"text":"Tea time here is so lovely here. Everything is so elegantly placed, and my god the tea! We ordered the sencha echinicea which was delish and complimented my creamy broccoli soup and crab crepe perfectly. Definitely coming back here again. A great place to have some girl time!"}
{"text":"I don't even care for English tea, and this place deserves 5 stars. 

It's just adorable, I've been multiple times in the last several years.  

The place is a bit tight, but cutely laid out in terms of the decor. It's perfect for a mother/daughter treat or a day out with girlfriends. I usually share an egg salad sandwich (comes with salad) and a double scone. They split the egg salad sandwich/salad in 2 plates by themselves without my requesting it, which is nice. The scones come with cream and jam -they aren't always 5/5 but always at least good and sometimes wonderful. They once had a special of the day of chocolate chip scones which were AMAZING. 

They have limited hours (only open in daytime). 

It's pretty much a MUST to book in advance for the weekend, especially if 3+ people are going. For Mother's Day, I called 2 weeks in advance and they were booked solid."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Lots of cute old people here!
We went in the middle of the week without a reservation during the holiday season and were seated right away, parking was a problem though because the place was full!
We ordered the high tea. We really enjoyed the salad! Everything comes in small portions, as you would expect, but it wall good. The picture shows the amount for 2 people, so it's 2 high teas combined in this tiered tray."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Tried to have a nice tea afternoon but was spoiled by unattentive service just because we were only two people."}
{"text":"i went their twice,i had their chicken salad and i think it's to die for and I had a few of their teas,they alway stood the test.
I tried their cheesecake and apple custard tart.
Everything is perfect but the carrot cake is a bit plain for me,needs more icing.
Lovely homey place to take your mum or granma!"}
{"text":"The Tea Room is a cute and cozy shop nestled in the heart of Streetsville. I've been here a couple of times and it's the perfect setting to catch up with your girlfriends or treat your mom to a nice afternoon out. High tea will cost you around $20, which makes it a steal when you dive into the scones and take a big gulp of the loose-leaf tea. Like another reviewer mentioned, I'd recommend making a reservation. It's always packed solid when I go. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Overall, a solid 3.5. 

Made a reservation for 2 people today at The Tea Room and we had a wonderful time. Our server was very warm, cheerful and attentive. I mentioned to her that I had a dairy insensitivity and she ensured that my high tea experience was filled with items that had little or no dairy. The assortment of teas is extensive. I choose Darjeeling and wasn't disappointed. If you choose a tea and you didn't like it, I saw them exchange the tea for another at an adjacent table. When the three tiered assortment arrived with scones, sandwiches and dessert, the presentation was great. The scones were warm and delicious. The sandwiches had traditional fillings like cucumber and cream cheese, egg salad and tuna salad. I wished they provided them on pastry perhaps instead of sand which  bread however I also recognize that for the price they offer high tea it's a great value. Their dessert was okay, nothing that really stood out for me but we're good. Their was a butter tart, Russian chocolate and a shortbread cookie. The space is very tight and cozy so don't wear many layers because it will get warm. Overall, a good experience. I would also recommend reservations to ensure a spot!"}
{"text":"I just had to write another review for this place. This Tea House is about the cutest thing I've ever seen. They touch upon everything you would ever want in a Afternoon Tea outing.

First of all, let's start with the ambience. How cute is it that they have Classical music playing on a speaker as you walk up to the door on a cobblestone walkway to get you into the mood?.

Second, the girls that work here are absolutely phenomenal. Not only are they upbeat, cheerful and attentive but they also are very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu items.

The food is so good here. I'm a person who needs a lot of flavour in her food but with minimal ingredients they are able to spit out delicious dishes.

The food is always fresh and always elegant. This place is humble, unpretentious and homely. It honestly feels like your going to grandmas house.

I love the cute little shop area as well. Nice added touch to view after dining. The place is wonderfully decorated.

If I could give some recommendations on what to eat, I would recommend the Chicken salad, the high tea tier and the hot fudge brownie with ice cream. I look forward to exploring the rest of the menu.

I would highly suggest this place to have Tea with your girlfriends or mother/daughter outings. This will continue to be go to spot for years to come."}
{"text":"I am so fortunate that this quaint tea room is located very close to me. This is my go to place for a special lunch date with friends and family. The girls here are friendly and the food never disappoints. I am especially fond of the Earl Grey Cream tea and of course their amazing scones!  Order high tea if it's your first time, you will wonder if you've died and gone to heaven. The tea shop and other shop within the same Robinson Bray House always have great items."}
{"text":"I have to admit this place has the worst customer service. I have been before on a reservation and they made such a big deal to add one person to my table. Not to mention,  the place was half empty. The main cook or manager I assume was so irritated and impatient,  I couldn't understand why...it was bizarre. Again, I've called to come in abtd they never accomodate anyone unless you call before..like NEVER..just takes the enjoyment out, almost lime they don't want you to come. Although the younger servers are nicer. Food and scones are good"}
{"text":"The Tea Room is a cute little place, definitely a gem in Streetsville. I've been a couple of times and loved it. There's a wide selection of teas to choose from. They offer high tea and afternoon tea but mostly I come for the delicious scones. They're large, not too dry, and perfect with a bit of jam. There's usually a few to choose from and they vary each time. 
Great place to catch up with friends. There's a little shop inside for purchasing tea sets and all sorts of tea related items. Make sure to call ahead and reserve a table. Unfortunately no milk alternative options or lactose free milk available with the tea."}
{"text":"OOH! First reviewer! ;)

Just because I know there's better tea rooms at comparable prices, I'm not a fan. But granted, this is still a good, cute tea room with decent food for a decent price.

Pros:
- cute, eclectic, kitschy environment
- decent prices; you can get away with a tea \"set\" (i.e. scone, a few sandwiches, a little cupcake here and there) with a brewed tea for around $20 (which is a good price for afternoon teas)
- cute experience 

Cons:
- impossible to find parking; they have a little lot to the side, but it's hard to park in Streetsville (a quaint old town feel neighbourhood in Mississauga) unless you're lucky enough to find street parking
- you should always make reservations because they only bake/cook enough for the reservations; and even if they bake a bit more and you do a drop-in, they're not that welcoming 

Some other miscellaneous notes about afternoon teas: boys don't generally like them that much because there's not that much food involved; however, the food that is served (albeit smaller portions), is quite filling because it's quite rich, but still... I think... boys like meat (?!)

A high tea place I *would* recommend though is the afternoon tea at the Old Mill Inn & Spa. Comparable prices, but better environment and tastier food."}
{"text":"Very quaint little tea room with a perfect atmosphere for high tea. Enjoyed the large selections of tea as well as the sandwiches and pastries that came along with it. Went here with the bridal party and I thought it was the perfect way to spend the afternoon after dress shopping. Highly recommend for a lovely afternoon tea."}
{"text":"I love this little Tea Room tucked away in The Robinson-Bray House in Streetsville, Mississauga.

It's older with lots of character - and regulars!

As other reviewers mentioned, it is recommended to make a reservation for your visit as to avoid disappointment. There parking lot (located behind The Robinson-Bray House) is small. Give yourself extra time to find street parking. The blocks in Streetsville are small though (compared to the usual suburban blocks) so it's a short walk away, even if you park a bit further.

ATMOSPHERE: Very quaint. Space is tight, so may not want to bring little children. The décor is dated but warm. You may not like it if you prefer modern and grand spaces. But I enjoy it as an old-time getaway found in my city.

SERVICE: Warm and friendly. They have a very home-y feel. Service is fairly attentive and quick.

PRICE: Cheaper than most tea places. I think their Christmas teas are worth it especially for the seasonal treats.

FOOD: I enjoy their scones - there's often 2-3 options to choose from. They have a large tea selection, comparable to other tea rooms. And they have a slightly larger menu, besides the usual goods served with tea, there are other choices - which is nice if you're going with people who have never been to a tea room before."}
{"text":"I've been to several afternoon tea locations in Toronto and I've kinda run out of places to visit. So we're starting to venture out of the immediate Toronto area to smaller towns.

Last month, we went to the Robinson-Bray House for afternoon tea. I'd link you to it but their website has been suspended as of today. Erm...okay.

When you enter, it is a store front with lots of random tea pots and tea accessories.

Just to note, when we ordered afternoon tea, they kinda need you to tell them in advance and apparently they only serve afternoon tea from 12 - 2PM. Um it's supposed to be eaten later in the afternoon but okay, I'm not gonna argue with you. Luckily my bf made reservations and they had enough prepared for the two of us.


I asked for my tea iced and here's a trade secret, apparently, when you pour hot tea into glass, to avoid it cracking, put something metal in it. 

So the afternoon tea came with a salad. BP HATES food with fruit but he actually liked it.

The quiches it came with were sooo good! It made us go buy quiche soon after haha. Egg salad was the best. But of course, egg salad is always the best kind of tea sandwich in my opinion.

Scones were ...scones? Nothing special.

Note to every tea place...can we not have any more mini cupcakes. Cupcakes aren't that great to begin with and mini cupcakes are just hard and terrible. STOP. No me gusta. The tart was okay but it's like...mousse on a tart shell. What can I say....

I would recommend this place if you're in town. I think you should definitely visit Streetsville though and check out the quaint neighbourhood.

{"text":"I don't really like tea but after seeing such elegant and pretty tea room pictures from a variety of tea rooms I decided to try The Tea Room out first. I would definitely recommend anyone to make reservations as The Tea Room is quite small. 

The Tea Room is quite small and old looking so it might not be your type of place if you like nice elegant places. I'm more into nice elegant places so it wasn't my cup of tea (see what I just did there?).

We arrived for afternoon tea at 2 pm on a Saturday and it was at 75% full capacity. Our server was friendly throughout our stay but it took a while to flag her down for our bill. We chose to do the Robinson Bray tea for 2 which is $38 and change (not including gratuity). He ordered the caribbean dreams tea and I chose the caffeine-free apple cinnamon tea. My tea had a very strong smell and taste to it that I didn't really like. I think in the future I will choose more traditional teas, such as a green tea. Afterwards, our finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts were brought out. The server explained what everything was which was really helpful. I thought the sandwiches were average, and the desserts were a bit on the sweet side. I practically gave everything to my boyfriend half eaten lol.

Besides the tea room they also have 2 shops at the front of the house. There are many cute cups and utensils for all your tea needs. Besides merchandise they also sell gift certificates if you ever want to buy them for a friend."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!

My friend took me here at noon as an early birthday treat and I've always enjoyed my time here. We usually go for high tea but this time we decided on the a la carte lunch menu. We each ordered a pot of tea. She got the Earl Gray Cream and I got the Chai.

I ended up ordering the smoked salmon quiche with a caesar salad and my friend ordered the crab crepe with a minestrone soup. The quiche and crab crepe were both good portion sizes so we swapped our plates halfway through.

I really enjoyed my smoked salmon quiche and my friend's crab quiche. Our waitress consistently checked up on us and refilled our tea pots.

This place is highly recommended for those who are looking to try out high tea. Very vintage and quaint feeling. I've been here for the Valentine's day tea and they give you a very good amount of food and desserts for around $27."}
