{"text":"Classic diner experience.  Good food and service.  Reasonable prices and great local conversation.  Physically... Aesthetically... It needs updating... Rather it needed updating in the 70s.  It is a time warp, and not in the good way.  Still, aside from the looks it is a what you see is what you get local hash joint with solid food and an eerie charm."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this hidden gem diner. Great service and the food reminds me of old school diners since it's cooked on a griddle. Eggs and pancakes never disappoint. Delicious! No complaints at all, and super impressed with how fast they bring your food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some uppity, elegant place...this is not for you.  If you are looking for a quick-bite, with solid food, good service and an old-school diner feel, this is for you.    Have been eating here since I was a kid, and it never disappoints.  Great breakfasts, and some good dinner specials each day."}
{"text":"Have dined here occasionally over the years. Always crowded, parallel parking out front on main st. Simple diner fare,including liver and onions,and hot roast beef sandwiches.  Got the wrong salad dressing,and drink,but server quickly took care of it.    I ordered the broiled fish,which was dry,with haluski,which was good.  My husband got the hot roast beef sandwich,which he liked,but he ordered his fries well done,but they werent. It may have been because it was close to 7pm,closing time.,but we will come back, we always do when in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and it never disappoints. I used to come here for breakfast with my mom before kindergarten back in 1994! Still eat here til this day. The daily specials (lunch and dinner) are what I stick to. Always delicious. Service is good too!"}
{"text":"Always good homemade foods and great daily specials.  Weekend breakfasts are excellent and the prices are reasonable.    Desserts are always fantastic!  This is a great place for a good meal!  The food should be listed as American."}
{"text":"I love local Mom & Pop diners. My husband and I stumbled upon Falce's on Saturday after going to an estate sale in Munhall, an area I don't know very well. This place was great! Good coffee.  I had the Greek Omelette. I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh everything was. They used fresh spinach! Now that I know where they are, we will be heading back to try some of their other goodies."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, everything came out hot and fresh. Small, cozy diner accommodations, home-style cooking, friendly customer service, priced well. Everything you could want from a quaint little cafe. We are only here for a week on business but we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great casual diner for breakfast. It is very low key but definitely doesn't try to be something that it's not. My go-to is the ham and egg special with well done hash browns."}
{"text":"Falce's is the bomb. I would give it 5 stars. But hear me out, I live close by and can walk there.   They serve great dinner and great breakfasts. But I love them because they feel like the old days. Everything is clean but just a little worn, but in a good way.   The food is great and super cheap. And they have liver and onions on the menu. And it is excellent. Who still has that on their menu? This is why I want to give them 5 stars. They haven't changed to be someone they're not, and I like who they are."}
{"text":"Definitely a place that is fantastic when within walking distance. Everything is extremely reasonably priced. The service has always been great, even when it's clearly busy / hectic. Great morning breakfast / coffee spot."}
{"text":"This is a cute place to eat, the waitresses pretty much know all the folks that come in and know what they will be ordering. Now it's not an elegant place, it's more of a no frill type of establishment. The prices are low and the food is pretty decent. I got pancakes and sausage and enjoyed them. I would definitely visit this spot again."}
