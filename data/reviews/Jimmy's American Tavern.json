{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try. Had been to all it's predecessors and wanted to get here before it closed for good! Once seated, no one came back to take drink or food order. Ever. Only people walking around were chefs (white coats?) Plus, it's an \"American\" tavern,and every worker was Asian. Not a problem. After 30 minutes of being ignored, we walked out, with staff saying thank you as we left, as if we'd been served! Horrendous. This place won't make it! Don't go! You'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"CLOSED.  

According to an article in the WI State Journal, the owner just shut the doors.  The article says he (the owner) never even contacted the landlord.  

Looks like all the reviews were spot on..."}
{"text":"BAD.  Shockingly expensive, poor quality food.  The salad bar is a nice idea, however it has no lights - how are you supposed to make a salad in the dark?  The inside seating area was dirty and felt like a Denny's in disguise.  Do not waste your hard earned cash here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out for lunch today, and it was just okay. We walked in and the hostess led us to a high top table in the bar, but didn't ask where we might like to sit. We would have preferred a booth, and it wasn't busy at all. That might sound overly picky (and we could have said something about preferring a booth), but it's nice to be offered the option. The inside is cool and they had some specials going on in celebration of the Kentucky Derby that the hostess pointed out when we got there. We started out with mojitos, which were \"on special.\" $5.50 didn't seem like a deal to me, but for a good mojito, I guess it's not too bad (and they were good). I thought the lunch menu was a little high priced, but not completely out of line. I ordered the chicken burger and my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It doesn't say on the menu that you get fries with the sandwiches but you do, which was nice. My chicken burger had sun-dried tomatoes and spinach packed in the patty. I liked it, but it wasn't anything to write home about - a little mushy. The pulled pork sandwich wasn't overly impressive and he was expecting more from the sauce, which ended up being pretty bland. We both thought the buns were not a good fit with the sandwich. Besides not being offered options of where to sit, the service was fine. Our waitress was attentive, but not overly present. She didn't tell us about the specials when we sat down, though, but maybe they just point them out at the hostess station when you come in. Like I said, the decor is nice and I think we'll come back for drinks, but the food was pretty lackluster. I'd like to see a restaurant succeed in this spot, but I feel like Jimmy's isn't sure what it wants to be. There are big screen TVs throughout and some really cool nooks that might be fun to watch a game in with a group of friends, but I don't think their intention is to be a sports bar. I'll be interested to see what type of crowd ends up going here. Maybe we'll give their dinner menu a shot. They just opened yesterday, so I don't want to be too harsh a critic...yet."}
{"text":"The WORST service EVER! Fish fry was TERRIBLE. Fries over salted and burned. 2 pieces of fried cod and it took 1/2 hour for waiter to return to ask if we wanted more ( all you can eat) Neglected to tell us that salad bar was included with meal. Cajun pizza was SOGGY (crispy crust... NOT!) had to ask for water 3 times. Only saving grace was the manager came to apologize and offered a gift card. Some lucky winner will get this card for the GAME SHOW SHOW!!!"}
{"text":"What a Joke! We went Friday afternoon about 5, only a few tables of other customers. The server started out great, explaining in detail about how they smoke the pork in the basement, burger is purchased locally and telling my kids how the Mac and Cheese is homemade, not the Kraft stuff out of the box most places serve. Good! That's what we'll order! Waiting the next 1/2 hour for our food was somewhat entertaining. Watching several tables angrily talking with the Mgr wondering where their food was, returning food and drinks back as they were wrong and guests leaving in a huff. Finally, OUR FOOD!  Not good! After 20 minutes we finally saw our waitress again...her reply \"I'm sorry I haven't been over to check on you, but the other waiter just walked out.\" \"Oh my gosh, that's Kraft Mac and Cheese, they changed it!\" \"And your burger, it's raw\"! I'm gonna get the Manager to credit your bill.  After watching the owner walk past our table several times without even acknowlaging us, we paid the uncredited bill and left.  The waitress's response as we left summed it up \"I wouldn't blame you if you never came back\"."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food and our waitress acted like nothing was wrong while the table next to us got a long winded apology from their waitress. She claimed that they were having the busiest day ever although the dining room was only half full. The food was good although it was a little pricey for just sandwiches. There was a small salad bar that looked good, but I opted out because it costs $10. When the food finally came, it was pretty good, especially the French fries."}
{"text":"We went to Jimmy's with another couple specifically for fish.  The place was not crowded, yet we were shown to a table up a long flight of steep stairs.  The first table we were seated at, the sun was directly in our eyes and no shade to pull.  The waitress was fine with us moving to another table, but by the end of the meal the sun was in our eyes at this table also.  Not a pleasant experience.  Three people ordered the all you can eat deep fried and one ordered the baked cod.  The only potato choice is french fries, which was disappointing.  We had to return downstairs for the salad bar - which means another trip upstairs after filling our plates.  We were there around 5:30 and many empty containers on the salad bar...no mushrooms, no tomatoes, very little roast turkey.  The waitress told us someone was bringing replacements from downstairs, but they never arrived in the time we were making our salads.  There are a couple of baskets of bread and rolls on top of the salad bar.  They were also near empty, and we almost didn't even see them.  What we had from the salad bar was fresh and good, and I did prefer it to coleslaw.  The fish was very mediocre.  No one ordering the all you can eat even had another helping.  The baked was 3 very tiny strips of overdone cod hidden by a huge mound of french fries that were also mediocre.  I predict this place will go by the wayside the same as Fitch's, Good Times and Kick Shaw.  I think the place is cursed.  We won't be back."}
