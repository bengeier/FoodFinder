{"text":"4 words: Beef and Chili Oil.  Order it and feel joy in your soul.  It's great to find some truly authentic Chinese food and holy cannoli is it amazing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Floor is sticky, kids operating the dining room are amateurs...won ton soup was more noodles than wonton and the broth was watery. Decided not to bother ordering an entree."}
{"text":"Don't go this is cheap skin place by mainland student thought they could make money in America, no restaurant experience.. not worth it too expensive no Value!  Only people go is local American thought genuine, but real Chinese Food lovers would find many other places in Valley"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Very authentic! I had the beef stir fry in oyster sauce. Incredible. 

One of the owners, a young and ambitious 24 year old Chinese immigrant, came out and talked to my friend and I about his restaurant, food in general and the differences living here vs China. It's amazing that he helps run this restaurant while in school! 

If you are looking for great, authentic Chinese food, look no further!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously poor service. Many dishes are often not available. Chicken has feather/hair in it. They don't manage to give us everything at the same time. We had to wait for 20 minutes(before the second last one) for the final one to get on our table. You know the feeling when you get full because you paused during eating. When we asked them why they don't have it ready, they gave us the shittiest attitude. Btw, we are the only table in there at 12:30pm noon. You had one freaking job!"}
{"text":"I travel to China multiple times each year.  This restaurant captures the true flavors of the Chinese food I eat over there.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  We had the beef noodle soup, beef with oyster sauce and the Sichuan spicy noodles!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! I like to try a place a few times before reviewing it, so we've eaten there 3 times so far, and each time the food was incredible and the service impeccable. So authentic and you can tell the quality is very high. Kung Pao Chicken and Curry Chicken...wow! And the list goes on. I'm so glad this place is near my office, I think I could eat here almost everyday. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Legit Chinese restaurant. Never had Chinese food like theirs before! The amount of their food is a lot. Trust me this is a legit Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"never again!!! food was terrible , over priced underwhelming not remarkable 
i don't know how this place has 3.5 stars?? or stays in business 
the owner? has no idea what he is doing, went at 7:30 place was empty
they must own the store front for there is no reason for this place to stay, the pictures on the menu do not equate to what you get,
if i could give no stars i would but alas yelp won't allow me to leave a review with out stars,  the food was so bad i ate 2 bites and could not stomach more, i left and got tacos!"}
{"text":"I visit Sichuan China almost 3 times a year. I've tried every authentic Chinese restaurant in the valley. The quality and care that goes into the food here is far worse than what most people make at home. Trust me if you are Chinese and looking for a real Sichuan restaurant, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yall are tripping, tripping me. I walked in this piece the other day. I was greeted by a few workers and i was in and out faster then you can say \"panda express\" with my to go order. I walked out and i walked back in again ready order until i looked down and realized i had my food already? Twilight Zone for you..."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Arizona. ??????????????? ???????????????."}
{"text":"I visited the Tang Dynasty a couple months back and had some of the duck wings. Being that duck is pretty fatty everywhere else I thought these would be served in a puddle of oil but it was quite tasty. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I plan to visit again to check out this karaoke scene. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Not your typical beef broccoli place, thank god. Definitely check it out. The lamb with fermented beans  and also the cold noodles were amazing."}
{"text":"If you're craving Chinese Hot Pot then this is your joint.  Come to try some of your favorite and unique Chinese veggies and meats.  Come hungry to try their long list of hot pot goodies.   If you like you can end your night with some singing in their karaoke rooms."}
{"text":"i ordered food for 4 of us tonight while we hung out at az wine co drinking some wine and beer at retail pricing.  the owners at tang brought us dinner and all plates bowls napkins etc.  picked it up when we were done for only 50$  so many great flavors.  dan dan noodles had great spice, lamb dish was so flavorful, chicken wonton soup was so much more flavor than anywhere else.  cant wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Had dinner there recently. This is a wayyy over-priced shady place! Such a rip-off! Be aware of their shady business practices! Food pictures on the menu look fancy. Dishes don't come as the pictures shown on the menu. What's worse, the server kept pressuring us order more food than we need! Food tastes below average. Not worth the price they are charging. Average spending is $30 per person in the restaurant. But you have better food for $15 in other restaurants. Shame on this flash new place. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now. Let me preface this by saying the flavor profile at this restaurant is not toned down. If you like to taste the spices and nuances in your dishes then this is a place to go, however if you just want the Chinese food you're used to eating at places with a similar profile to Panda Express you won't like it. Likewise if you're thinking you'll be paying Panda Express prices you won't be. The least expensive dish on the menu (not including appetizers or add on dishes) was twelve dollars. The portions here are generous. We had a a lamb dish and the sweet and sour fish. The fish was soft but not mushy,  and was rather enjoyable coupled with some chili sauce. The lamb was the best dish.  We felt it was seasoned perfectly and like the fish it also got bathed in chili oil. The dumplings had an irregularity to their shape which made me think they where home made they were also delicious. I can't speak to the bathroom as other reviewers have. Both times we have been there the place wasn't very busy and only one other party was there. They do have private Karaoke rooms if that's something you'd be interested in however you'll need to pregame at the VFW or the bar next door as they don't have a liquor licence."}
{"text":"Seriously the most authentic food in the area! And the people are so amazing! If you need help the will help you decide something you'll like! They have these hot sweet potatoes and you dip them in your cold water and they are so much fun! Don't miss this if you love Chinese. There's also a wine bar next door and you can bring in wine for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm one of the previous employe there and this place is just horrible to have a meal or work at. The day I was hired the past manger told me everything about the paycheck and the hours are just perfectly fine. After the original one came back, this place is going way further with the law. They pay under minimum wage which 5dollar an hour as a tipped worker, and they pay every position the same amount . They also don't pay their employees twice the amount when it's holiday time. The back is filthy dirty, filled with roaches and keep the food oil from previous customers and reuses the oil as many times as they can.  I was also doing every subject of this restaurant and asked two times to get my checks up and all he told me was there are no money for me. They never pay me on time, always delay and always have reasons. 

Just for safety reason, I don't suggest you go to a nasty human being place to have a meal at ."}

This Chinese Restaurant is for people that enjoy Sichuan Style Chinese Food. 

The interior is rich with granite and beautiful decorative gold on the walls. I noticed several small rooms around the dining room that might be for private dining. I found that ordering a beverage might be a problem........I'll explain at the end.......but the food is really amazing.

You should ask more questions than I did.....I thought they were expensive because prices on some plates ran high but the price reflected portions that I was unaware of so I came home with tons of leftovers. But it wasn't a bad thing.

We started out sharing Sichuan Cold Noodles. The cold noodles were chewy and were topped with a ground peanuts with Asian seasonings and chili. The dish also contained cucumber to cool you off and lighten it up. As you ate this dish the flavors and heat grew and the dish became more interesting and delicious.

I ordered the New School Sichuan Fish Filets in Hot Chili Oil. This dish is very large and I think it can feed 2-4 people depending on how much rice you eat. This dish is similar to Water Boiled Fish but better. They made the dish with sole that was meaty and mild. This was hot and spicy but not as spicy as the Cultural Center makes it. This dish was very good.

My husband ordered the Beef in Hot Chili Oil. YOU MUST GET THIS DISH because it was PHENOMENAL!  This dish was far more complex than the fish. The beef was so flavorful and melted like butter in your mouth and it was in a beefy light sauce with lettuce. It was amazing. I never had any beef in any Chinese Restaurant that was this good before. I think they held back on the chili a bit because they came out and asked us if we like spicy.......

The food and atmosphere seemed like 5 stars....

The problems......

I tried to order an iced tea.....Our waiter at first says yes and then looks at a nearly empty clear ice tea dispenser. I then noticed the dispenser and realized it was left out over night and nobody cleaned it out...THAT IS NOT GOOD. I then asked for a glass of water and got water without ice. The water is terrible......undrinkable.......maybe it was leftover from something ....so I didn't drink anything.

They give you one serving plate and one bowl...After the Sichuan Cold Noodles that we shared we didn't want to use the same bowl for other foods so we had to steal bowls from another table ourselves. 

We were the only table in the restaurant and it took them a good 15-20 minutes to pack up our leftovers on the table next to us....I sort of fear what the service might be like if they get busy.


If you are a fan of Sichuan you will want to check this place out...but you might want to sneak in your own beverage.

I'm not sure if I should have awarded 4 stars because of the beverages but in this case I let them slide mostly because the food was good and they are a new business. 

Next time I'm going to try the Lotus, Snowbeans, Black Fungus and Carrots!"}
{"text":"We visited China,and my daughter in law is from Beijing and craves authentic schezuen food.....this restaurant serves authentic food. The flavor of the lamb skewers was delicious as the ones we purchased from a street vendor in China.....the noodle dish flavorful.....spicy tofu dish was seasoned just right. The only reason for 4 not 5 stars...the restroom was dirty (resembled ones I used in China). I would definately return and try more of their authentic recipes...if you like schezuen but not overloaded spicy, you must try Tang Dynasty."}
{"text":"I have been to this place once. The food tastes like amateur home cook dish. They charge you a lot for what they offer in food. In addition to their low value, my main concern with this place is hygiene. Their restrooms are FILTHY. I was shocked by the condition of their restrooms. Imagine employees use the restroom and go back to prepare food! Not sure I feel comfortable going back to that place again after seeing their restroom. The restaurant reminds me of the dining areas of a college dorm. Plus, it is way more expensive than the other food in and around college. My advice, if you want to have a pleasant experience with reasonably priced food, don't bother trying this place. Waste of your time and money. You can definitely have better food with a cheaper price anywhere else in town.

P.S. I am concerned that the restaurant is hiring people to write good reviews for them on Yelp. The food pictures they post in the reviews are nothing like the food you will get from the restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is awesome! I wasn't sure what to order so I just told them to bring me a bunch of their favorites. I was not disappointed! Everything was amazing! I had some lamb thing & a nut chicken that was crazy delicious. I'm often next door at AZ Wine and will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I can't get over this place! I want to eat their chicken dumpling soup every day! Dan dan noodle, oyster beef, everything has been delicious during both of my visits. And to top it off, the owners are so sweet and really take pride in their dishes. Definitely want to try out a karaoke room soon."}
{"text":"Worst spicy pot I ever had in us. 4 shrimps with some potatoes and sauce from super market will cost u $20. Really a sad experience."}
{"text":"The best thing about this Chinese restaurant is that it is totally different from other places that claim to be offering Chinese cuisine. I guess that's because the ownership is straight from the mother country and hasn't been distorted by American tastes. A pit pricey, but worth it, The menu offers lots of stuff I've never tried and I will have too go back many times before I can say that I'm familiar with the food. I will say this, going back will be a pleasure, especially given the staff's great attitude and the pleasant decor. We had the lamb with cumin, the hot and sour soup (warning the soup comes in huge bowls fit for at least six), the fried pork ribs, the cold beef, and the chicken hearts. They were all great. And, there was none of that bloated, salted, and msg-ed effect that so often follows eating Chinese. What a delight."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!!!!
I went to almost every Chinese restaurant in Arizona and this one is the most expensive and is the worst one in Arizona! The food they serve was cold! The taste was really bad! And the service is really bad as well! And they charge my debit card $1 more than I tipped! I don't want to call them just because of $1.  So I prefer tell everyone over here that DO NOT GO such a expensive, bad taste, bad service and dishonest restaurant!!!"}
