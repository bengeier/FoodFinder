{"text":"this place sucked... worst $6.99 i've ever spent. the burrito was all tortilla, very little meat and just plain dull (typical arizona mexican food, no flavor). i basically spent almost $7 for a tortilla. not only that but i called in advance and placed an order. they did not have my burrito ready, instead they waited until i got there to start making it. what's the point of ordering in advance if they are not going to start until you get there??? i will never go back, what a waste of my time and money. very upset."}
{"text":"If you like authentic Mexican food, El Potrero Carniceria is the place to go.  They not only have an awesome selection of Mexican cuisine, but also a great variety of desserts such as pan dulce and arroz con leche. Not only can you enjoy a meal but you also have the convenience of doing your own grocery shopping. This place has it all from ice cream to pinatas for a kids party that can be special ordered. So enjoy a dine in experience or take out there famous tacos, tortas and burritos. The beans in my opinion are mind blowing, there hint of chipotle adds an authentic taste."}
{"text":"Think I'm done with this place... went to the counter to order some guacamole and the dude heard me- I know he did because he made eye contact - and then decided to ignore me and walk away.  Waited till he came back and he FINALLY acknowledged my presence in a begrudging way and I told him I needed a pound of guac.  Guy grabs a tiny container (not a pound), fills it, weighs it and practically throws it at me.  WTF?  Is this because I'm hispanic and didn't speak spanish and brought my white boyfriend in? Apparently they don't want any english speaking business or caucasians in there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were driving down the street with the windows rolled down, it was an usually nice day for Arizona, and we were hit by the most amazing smell of meat. After running our errands, we decided to come back and find the source of that amazing meat smell and investigate further.  We came across El Potrero Carniceria. We were a little hesitant due to the low rating on yelp, but decided that our noses knew better.  It seems to be a typical Carniceria, but we didn't really look around at the aisles because we were so hungry! My boyfriend wanted me to order for our first time there because I'm more comfortable Spanish, though it probably wasn't necessary.   We got our order right in, and stood around waiting. The guy at the register came around and started talking to us. He was very friendly, basically giving a little background on the stuff to eat and even gave free samples of the chicharones, stewed and deep fried (omg! Both sooooooo good!).  Anyways, we got our burritos and they were HUGE. I could seriously only eat half! The flavor was so good! The meat was so tender. I have included a picture so you guys can see with your own eyes and not listen to the haters!   Please do yourself a flavor and give them a try! Thank you, El Potrero for a wonderful experience. We'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"So I give this place 2 stars ONLY because the gentlemen at the register was very polite and the carne asada tacos were ok. It took almost 10 mins to take my order, the two ladies in the back were rude and didn't even try to take my order instead taking it from the guys behind me. Finally I order after 10 mins of standing there like wtf, I asked specifically for my Tripas  to be crispy and waited another 7-10 mins for 3 street tacos(mind you the meat was already cooked). Then I get my tacos plain as day when I get back to work, no cilantro onion or anything that comes customary on street tacos, nor did they ask if I wanted it with everything so I could get the host that maybe I need to bag my own veggies to go. I came here because it was close to work, but never again. With 3 people behind the kitchen and mostly everything already pre cooked there is no reason I should have wasted my entire lunch time waiting on bland tacos. My experience was not a good one unfortunately and I will be taking my taco cravings down the street elsewhere."}
