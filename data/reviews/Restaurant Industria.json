{"text":"Excellent pizza, very nice, modern and clean place, friendly and quick service. A bit pricey but hey, someone has to pay that ridiculous rent to Cadillac Fairview every month. I'd come back if ever got the urge for high quality pizza."}
{"text":"Aller à l'ouverture du restaurant du carrefour Laval, belle déco, pizza excellente lorsque sortie de four, notre serveur très attentionné et professionnel et hyper sympathique, nous a reconnu lorsque nous y sommes retourner un vendredi soir très bondé, plus bruyant, nous avons dû prendre place au bar, et ce fut une expérience totalement différente, et il s'es assurer que nous étions satisfait et nous a apporté un petit dessert offert par la maison, vous y trouverai aussi des produits sur place (sauces, pâtes, etc) pour déguster à la maison, en gros dépendant du moment où du jour il y en a pour tous les goûts."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 5 on a Saturday night. Was given two time options: 5:30 or 8pm. We chose 8pm. We got there on time and had to wait 25 minutes for a table while watching others with no reservations be seated before us. Decided to try to get a drink at the bar while waiting, stood there for 10 minutes and the bartender never even looked at us. Finally got seated, given menus. Waited for another 15 minutes before anyone even came to see us for a drink order or to give us water. The restaurant was CLEARLY understaffed. Our waitress was very nice, and clearly flustered as she was serving way too many tables by herself. 

The food was decent. I shared a grilled octopus appetizer and it was delicious! Ordered a Capricciosa pizza as my main course. It was a bit bland, and it was very watery. Had a scoop of gelato for dessert and it was melted when it arrived.

My friends enjoyed their dishes (salmon, ravioli, tagliatelle). The drinks were really off their mark: my  vodka martini came with no olives, amaretto sour was undrinkable, cosmo was NOT a cosmo. The White House wine was good.

Atmosphere of the restaurant is great - they really need more staff and better training for their staff. Reasonable price and decent food, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit and test out Industria's new location in Laval today with my fellow MTL yelp foodie Jason M. Tested the calabrese wood fired pizza. Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, spicy sopressata and fresh basil. Pizza surprised me how damm good it was. Light fluffy and crispy. Perfect medley of crisp, light tomato and cured meat. Plus their hot peppers in oil was amazing! Definitely a return back kind of place. Great pizza! Plus the big scissors to cut the za was a nice touch! 
 
The restaurant is a very open air spacious type of feel. In the front is a bar against he window. In the back of the restaurant is a huge heart wood fired oven. Pizzas came out quick and efficiently. Definitely need to head back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened two weeks ago, I had gone to the Galleries Anjou branch, which I really enjoyed. The one in Carrefour Laval, is huge, it even has a second  floor which I think its for private gatherings.
The menu differed a bit from the one in d'anjou.

For appetizer I ordered the grilled octopus, which was excellent, it was served on a bed of white bean purée, topped with shallots, celery and red kidney beans, it was excellent, its not meant to be shared in my opinion.

As for our main course we had marguerita pizza and lamb chops. It was good but both dishes lacked salt and pepper, it wasn't seasoned properly at all. We had to ask for a salt and pepper shaker.

For dessert we shared à tiramisu, which was excellent but again like the octopus it isn't meant to be shared.

Prices is reasonable, the ambiance is good but very noisy, they had a dj which didn't help the noise pollution.

A few things bothered me, Montreal and Laval has some great restaurants, but what makes a restaurant 5 star in my opinion is attention to detail.

As compared to the Anjou branch they have some work that still needs to be done. First of all your staff should be able to explain the menu and dishes and give proper advice. Also there was no spicy oil, salt pepper on the table. Food was lacking seasoning. No one brought us water and our glasses were empty throughout the service. Just because someone order alcohol doesn't mean you should not bring them water like you do for other tables. Service was a bit slow but since they are new its understandable.

All in all a strong 4 star, needs some adjustments but im sure with time they will step it up."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and really enjoyed their pizzas. The spicy soppressata pizza is my kind of vibe. Italian style pizza, big on flavor and doesn't stack up on a bunch of toppings like most North American pizzas. Crust is thin and reasonably well spread out. Price for the pizza is a little higher than expected but still holds a lot of value.

I love this location. The resto is beautiful with extremely high ceilings and a rustic feel. It's fancy without looking pretentious. Huge wood over dominates the area. Decorations and beautiful to look at. This could be a real nice date place.

Service was good on all my visits. Not overly friendly and something they can work on but the orders were taken quickly and the food was served in a timely way (less than 15). I'm sure if they're rushed this may change but overall for me this was a positive experience.

Would totally come back and again if they maintain this experience."}
{"text":"Really nice Italian place to go with family and kids. The food was amazing and the service was top! Great place to share plates and appetizers. The kids enjoyed themselves and we had a great time. The interior design is really nice and warm."}
