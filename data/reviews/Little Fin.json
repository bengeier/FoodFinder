{"text":"a nice little place that's just on the side and its just the right size. best seafood I have had in years. the Crispy Haddock is a must try."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to make our way to Little Fin to get some seafood. Its a small take out spot with just a few seats inside, enough to accommodate about 12 people. We were pretty hungry and decided to over indulge ourselves with their seafood offerings. Together, we had the lobster BLT, crispy haddock sandwich, sweet potato chowder and the lobster poutine. Their sandwiches came with a choice of two sides as well, so this gave us a ton of food. We sat ourselves down and thankfully, there are hooks to hang our coats on the underside of the table. The food was pretty much all delicious. The crispy haddock consisted of a good sized portion of battered fish in a toasted sesame bun. It had a nice crunch and tasted great! The lobster BLT was a delight as well. It had a fair amount of lobster and was littered with pieces of bacon. The other lobster dish was the poutine, which was made up of potato wedges, large chunks of lobster and gooey, melted cheese. The sweet potato chowder was something that neither of us had tried before but we enjoyed this different take on chowder. Really, the only thing we didn't like was the coleslaw side, since it wasn't really anything special. The sandwich combos were priced reasonably ($9 to $16), considering that they come with two sides. To me, this makes it a great lunch option and I wish it was located close to my office. We couldn't finish all the food and left stuffed. With the friendly service, good food and reasonable prices, we definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try it out.  I must said I was blown away by the tuna sandwich.  Crispy potato wedges and seaweed salad were a big surprise."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but within the past few months, prices have gone up and the service/quality has gone down.  The Haddock sandwich I used to always get was $9, now $12.  Just tried the Special Feature Salmon Poke salad for $10 and the portion was so tiny.  (I got it for lunch and was not satisfied at all, I would not get this again).  The nice \"little fin\" paper bags they gave you are no longer around, and no more flavoured water at the front of the restaurant.  I used to really like the place but now feel like they are just getting CHEAP."}
{"text":"Best lobster Poutine ever!  Giant chunks of lobster!!!!  I ordered the large to share between three friends.  We were surprised how big it was but it was so tasty, we kept eating until the last potato wedge"}
{"text":"Little Fin is a refreshing change from the other lunch options available in the financial district. The restaurant is small, seating about 10-15 people, but most come here for takeout anyway so we normally don't have a problem finding seats. 

It was pretty busy when we went during peak lunchtime but we got our food pretty quickly. We ordered: 
- Salmon sandwich: This sandwich came with bacon which completely covered the salmon taste, which was a little disappointing
- Tuna sandwich: Delicious! The tuna was cooked perfectly and the flavour was excellent. 
- Both sandwiches came with a choice of two sides, and we chose crispy garlic potatoes and seaweed salad for each. Loved them both!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place for some quick eats.  A tad pricy for the portions, I guess that's downtown expectations, which is okay. 

The seaweed salad and lobster sandwich was really good.  I really enjoyed the seaweed salad, it's a twist of taste and ingredient compared to what I usually have.  It was really refreshing.  

There's a lot of choices to choose from. Some very different from the usual seafood menus.  Will definitely return to try the rest when chance is given.

The place is very clean and the decor of the place makes it really fun.  I enjoy the consideration in the design displayed at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I actually found this joint while going on a food adventure with friends in Toronto. We were going out to search for coffee places and we got hungry looking for one. At that point in time I was also looking for good Ahi tuna places and I was trying to find food trucks and I was hoping to go to St Lawrence fish market to grab some. To my surprise around the corner was Little Fin. After our coffee break we went inside and looked at the menu. The menu had a lot of different seafood you can get. There was lobster burgers, etc. I saw the ahi tuba was on the menu and ordered it. To my surprise I found that the Ahi Tuna burger was as tasty as some of my friends said it was. The coleslaw that came with it was a good compliment to the lunch.

My friends ordered macaroni and I had a taste of it. I was really impressed with the taste! It's a great place to take anyone for lunch, and especially if you are working it is a great place if you want to grab a quick bite before heading back to your office! Definitely will go back there if I get a chance to go to that area! I recommend this to anyone who is scouting or passing by the area!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, paying mostly for presentation. Price is also a little high. The ambiance is nice - clean and fresh. Only went twice."}
{"text":"Little Fin what happened?
This is my 5th visit in the last few months and I was so disappointed. This is my 3rd time  ordering the lobster grilled cheese and to my disappointment when I opened my sandwich it appeared I had a leek and bacon bits sandwich. You need a magnifying glass to find the lobster. Not impressed."}
{"text":"\"little fin\". more like little win.

pros: pretty decent prices for fresh, quality seafood. hot the mahi on a bun and my brother got the salmon. both were pretty dang good. total win.

cons: the place itself is a little small so i could see it maybe being too crowded during lunch."}
{"text":"This place is not too far from my work, so when I bought the voucher, I came over with a co-worker to give it a try. Their menu is fairly simple, and their most expensive is half to whole lobster. Pretty pricey I'd say. 1/2 lb lobster for $20!!! With some slaw and potatoes!!! Whole lobster for $30!!! Pretty crazy to me, even if its fresh from the tank...

Anywho, I tried their 'Lobster Grilled Cheese' w/ Sweet Potato Chowder. The nice thing is the voucher covered both those items for $20. The bad thing is, if I didn't have the voucher, this would be quite a pricey lunch at a take-out place. The front counter helpers are very nice and helpful, and they make this place better b/c of service.

The lobster grilled cheese is not much lobster and melted swiss or mozarella cheese. Its okay, I can make one just as nice for cheaper. The slaw was not too good in my books. It was strong in onion flavour, and it had a strong pickled flavour as well.

The sweet potato chowder was alright. I thought it would be better, but its just okay. 
I'd say the best part of the meal was the beverage I purchased which was the 'fresh clementine juice'. I may come back to try something else next time. I'd say though for sandwiches and soup for seafood, my go to place is 'The Fish Store/Sandwiches' on College owned by Korean family."}
{"text":"Great spot for takeout, especially when organizing lunch at the office (Big bonus that I'm based in the Bay Adelaide Centre).  I'm now in the habit of automatically picking the Lobster Roll with Spicy Wedges and Seaweed Salad whenever I go."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Haddock was thin and greasy, tasted reheated like 2nd time out of fryer. Lobster roll was 80% salad 20% lobster. Completely disappointed with the low quality of food here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. I was super excited to try this place after all the photos on this site. I got the lobster roll with garlic potato wedges and seaweed salad. The lobster roll was a bit bland. Lots of dill and iceberg cabbage and not much lobster flavor. The lobster, although there was a lot of it, was overpowered by the dill. The bun was really nice, like a nice fluffy brioche. The garlic potatoes with mayo weren't too greasy but had a weirdly acidic aspect to them. I'm not sure why but after eating them my tongue felt like I had eaten a dozen lemons. Strange. Seaweed salad was alright, I liked it but I wasn't wowed by it."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the bad reviews. We went there today and had the lobster blt, salmon sandwich and seaweed salad. Everything was great. 

The food was fresh and the sandwiches were some of the best I've had in Toronto. Both the side wedges and vinegar slaw were really good too. The seaweed salad was interesting and well dressed. The salmon had a unique (and delicious) sweet and tangy marinade.

The staff were also all super friendly. I liked the decor, clean, modern and simple. 

As an aside, I had my lobster on a gluten free bun and they were incredibly friendly and accommodating about checking the food for both lactose and gluten so if that's a concern, you're safe here.

If I had to complain, the portions are on the small side but perfectly fine for lunch. And it's not cheap but compared to other lunch spots, they're right on target on for the food you get.

I think everyone who had a bad experience here should give them a second chance."}
{"text":"A TravelZoo voucher prompted a friend and I to make the visit.

First off the décor - the place is adorable. Clean, open, bright with nice touches to remind you that you're in a seafood establishment. Much of the graphics that appear on their website also make appearance in the restaurant.

We went after work so I have no idea how their lunch rush is or if they even have one. But on a Monday evening the place was pretty deserted. 

I ordered the Big Eye Tuna sandwich with the seaweed salad and crispy potatoes as sides
The tuna steak was thick, nicely seared and paired well with their Asian-inspired marinade.
I was disappointed that wine I ordered to go with it wasn't as generous.

The prices don't vary from lunch to dinner service but while I would gladly pay this amount for a quick casual dinner it is a little pricey for lunch. But that tends to be typically for any seafood joint. 

I would visit again if I wanted to treat myself for lunch or wanted to grab dinner with a friend or colleague after work but for the same price I think Buster's Sea Cove does it better."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through Foodora.

Lobster roll had maybe an ounce -- and that's being generous; there was a small handful of teeny, tiny pieces -- of lobster, with herbs that overpowered the taste of the lobster.  Maybe eight potato wedges, and some nasty slaw.

Fish and chips were worse than any diner -- fish was hard and thin and again, a few potato wedges and a ton of the nasty, inedible slaw.  

For 50 bucks (delivery), neither of us felt like we ate anything."}
{"text":"Dear Little Fin, 

We are off to a bad start! I didn't even get to try your food. Why? Because you are CLOSED on SUNDAY, when clearly it says on your yelp page you are open (I live in the suburbs which takes me an hour to get downtown). As we were standing outside of Little Fin, my friend decided to give them a call. A woman picked up and said they were closed but we can come to Chase which opens at 5. First off it's 12:30, we are outside of Little Fin, hungry and it says on the Yelp page open on Sundays. She had said that they did need to update the Yelp page. That is so annoying.   

I also checked your website but your mobile site is difficult to navigate...and not user friendly at all. So for that, I will not be wasting my time to come back. Thanks for nothing. 

Sincerely, 
Lost Customer"}
{"text":"Ordered from Foodora for the first time and was super excited to see Little Fin listed and we decided to give 'er a go.

We ordered fresh food, the Little Fin cooks decided to take an early retirement and send us old, stale food.  The bread had to be longer than a day old bun, teeth couldn't cut through, it was that hard.  Completely spoiled meal for me!  Fish was dry and overcooked.

My partner had the lobster poutine and liked it okay.  It would have been much better with some lobster!  Most others have also complained at the lack of lobster, no different here.

Don't bother.  Super disappointing, don't say I didn't warn yah."}
{"text":"Had the salmon breaded burger with seaweed salad and fries. Great fresh flavour and I had their side sauce for my fries. Amazing! Friendly staff, very efficient even though it was extremely busy during lunch hours. 

Only compliant is that if you come here hungry, the quantity will not do you any justice with my order."}
{"text":"The space between Dineen's and Chase can be easily overlooked, but with great variety of fresh seafood options, it is definitely worth the visit.

I decided to order the Lobster Poutine and the Lobster BLT, which came up to a total of approximately $32 ($12 and $16 respectively). While I find their prices a bit too high, the food tastes phenomenal and the service is equally as fantastic. I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I visited Little Fin with my friend. Very nice \"fast food\" place. I love sea food and I love unordinary food. This is the place for it. All \"burgers\" and \"hotdogs\" are with seafood. I had lobster roll, and my friend had mahi mahi sandwich. Very nice sides of potato wedges and seaweed salad. Everything is a little salty to my taste but would be perfect for my husband. Will take him there for sure."}
{"text":"Best Service Ever?I got my burger for free because they feel I have wait few minus longer than normal. Also, the crispy haddock is very yummy!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place through a Travel Zoo, spend $10 and get $20 worth.  I thought it would be worth it to give it a try.  I LOVE fish sandwiches.  My husband and I ordered the crispy haddock with potatoes and seaweed salad ($9) and the lobster grilled cheese ($13).  The lobster grilled cheese had good pieces of lobster but the cheese wasn't super hot or flavourful, the cheese was quite liquidy; all in all it was just okay.  The crispy haddock on the other hand was a generous portion of fish and it was DELICIOUS, amazingly tasty.  I really liked the potatoes (more like wedges) and my husband loved the seaweed salad.  All in all we will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"I ate here with a Groupon. Very cute little place. Nice design. We had the lobster grilled cheese and a special cod sandwich with potatoes and seaweed salad. Everything tasted good. The seafood was cooked really well and the portions are pretty decent sized. Great little lunch or quick dinner place!"}
{"text":"Little Fin is a busy lunch spot, packed with Bay Street-ers standing by high-top tables. There are no seats inside, but patios tables & chairs outside, so this place is definitely not a place you dwell at. Simply, eat and go. 

I got the lobster hot dog, which was essentially lobster on hot dog on bun. Little Fin custom bakes black buns, coloured with bamboo charcoal. Unfortunately, my bun was stale, grainy/sandy feeling, with no particular flavor. The hot dog itself was just okay, nothing special, but pretty expensive for what it was ($15). It wasn't particularly big either, as the size compares to Oscar Mayer hot dogs you buy for your children for their afternoon snack. My friend got the lobster BLT ($18), and she summarized her experience simply and accurately - \"it's good, but I've had much better\". 

On a better note, the staff was really nice. When I paid, they told me how long it would take approximately (6 minutes), and they were right. The service was fast, and friendly. 

Needless to say, I probably wouldn't go back. Really wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic lobster poutine. Wish there was more comfortable seating available, but friendly staff. Worth stopping in for a poutine and a pint."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of my colleague.
The place is very small in size- however they have good variety.
Tried the Shipwrecked salad (shrimp and eggs) - well made and delicious.
Will go back again and try out other choices.."}
{"text":"The place was packed on Friday when my cousin and I placed our order at 1:30pm. As other yelp reviewers have mentioned, it's usually busy during lunch hours only. 

We both ordered the mahi mahi burger ($11) with seaweed salad and crispy potatoes. The salad was really tasty but wasn't mixed through so some bites were saltier. The crispy potatoes had nice seasoning and came with their fancy/hot sauce and ketchup packets. The burger was on the sweeter side because of the mahi mahi marinade - pineapple jerk sauce which wasn't a problem but the fish was overcooked. 

We waited about 15-20 mins for our food but the free lemon water at the entrance made it seem shorter. By the time we finished our meal, the restaurant was completely empty. 

Overall, this place doesn't really stand out to me food wise but I wouldn't mind trying something new. Would recommend going after 2:30 or 3pm though just to avoid the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Really good, ordered the crispy haddock with slaw and potatoes here yesterday for lunch.

The sandwich was delicious, nice sized piece of haddock and loaded with capers which I love. The real star of the show was the crispy potatoes! I'd honestly just go in and get 2-3 orders of just the potatoes, seasoned with salt and garlic, they were delicious.

Slaw was decent, nothing to get excited about but nice nonetheless.

Will definitely be back again, especially with their affiliation with the Grabb app meaning I don't even have to wait

Losing a star as my colleague got the lobster roll and wasn't impressed. We both agreed about the potatoes though!"}
{"text":"The haddock is excellent, not too greasy or salty like fish and chips usually tend to be.

Would be 4 stars if not for the lobster roll.  For 16$, the lobster roll is disappointing.  Very little lobster and mostly lettuce, and overall, lacks in taste."}
{"text":"A bit claustrophobic inside but a nice lunch spot. I'll suggest taking it to-go and find somewhere else to sit. Small patio gets crowded as well during the lunch rush. The chicken blt was a good choice, however it looked like the tuna tacos should've been the choice I made."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the crispy haddock sandwich with garlic potato wedges and seaweed salad. Friendly and fast service. This place gets crowded quick! We chose to eat on the patio because it was too busy inside. The lineup snakes awkwardly around diners but that didn't really matter. The table on the patio was super wobbly. Also didn't matter. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"Solid offering of fish in a variety of dishes.  Get the seaweed salad and potato wedges as your sides.  You can't go wrong!  Go before 12pm to guarantee a spot to sit and beat the financial district lunch rush.  Relax for a coffee at Dineen (next door) afterwards."}
{"text":"I don't work to far Lil Fin. So I decided to try it out.
I got the haddock sandwich with fries. They offer coleslaw and other sides. The sandwich and fries were thirteen bucks which is normal for trying to get good sandwich downtown. I recommend this place the food is worth the visit. So if you ever downtown Toronto and looking for a good fish sandwich go check out Lil Fin."}
{"text":"The haddock sandwich is incredible and the garlic fries are so delicious. I usually get take out from here, and even with the 10min walk back to my work, everything remains crispy and delicious!
Compared to other seafood sandwich places in the area, this place offers a lot more at a lower price point, which is very surprising considering where it is located.

This place can get busy at times, but if you use the Grabb app, you wont have to wait in line!"}
{"text":"I went there today with my husband. 

I ordered a small lobster poutine ($12) and he ordered the grilled cheese ($13).  Poutine does not come any side while the grilled cheese does.  

The food was good. However, it was super overpriced.  The poutine for $12 dollars without any sides? Not worth the money especially when it is really small portion.  They put real lobster meat in it because my poutine had some lobster bone in it.  

The grilled cheese, i think its ok because it tasted good and comes with 2 sides. Yet, next time,  i wont get the poutine but will try their burger, instead."}
{"text":"Little Fin is def a quick grab-n-go spot for people who work in the financial district. And I mean those who have extra money to spend on something that is small in portion. There are few tables inside the place where you can stand around to take gulf down that sandwich which will prob take you 4 bites, max. I tried both the lobster hotdog and rock shrimp on a bun and they were both decent. I would've enjoyed rock shrimp on a bun a lot better if it wasn't so salty. Buns had nice chew to it and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It is def pricey for the portion they serve and I think I will need 3 of their sandwiches to feel full."}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch with a few friends on a Saturday at about 1PM. 

It's a very small place with high stool and shared table seating. It was very clean and the décor exuded the setting of a fishing boat. The bathrooms were CLEAN.

I ordered the fish & chips which were overcooked and a bit dry. The chips (fries) were very salty. As a sucker for fish & chips, I was let down, as I expected better from a seafood joint.

The staff were very friendly and it is a nice place, but the food wasn't very good. I would try it again for a different item on the menu, but it won't be the first place I think of going."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and it came with 2 sides (seaweed salad, coleslaw or crispy potatoes). I chose the seaweed salad and crispy potatoes. The burger was delicious and the sides were also better than expected. The staff was great and recommended a few things to try next time. Definitely a place to stop by!"}
{"text":"I finish class near Vic College (museum station) and my cousins, who suggested we eat here, works near Youge and Adelaide. That's a 35 min walk for me! Taking the subway would be silly seeing as it was rush hour so my SO and I chose to walk it. It was such a cold day. I remember feeling angry that we'd have to truck through the nasty downtown slush just for dinner. By the time we arrived we were HUNGRY and irritated. 

Truly this restaurant was the little lighthouse to my, once lost, sailboat.

The small yet wonderful menu choices pleased me. The complimentary cucumber and lime water was refreshing and reminded me of summer. Anyways, back to the food. My cousins chose to order the Lobster Grilled Cheese with Crispy Potatoes and Slaw for their sides while My SO ordered a large Lobster Poutine. I had the bunless Crispy Haddock with Seaweed salad and Slaw. 

I assumed that I would receive half a filet with my sides..well, on the side. Nope. My tray came with a enormous full sized filet that was golden brown and crispy. It rested gloriously on a seabed of rich green algae and slaw. I don't remember how everyone else reacted however, I vaguely recall my SO mentioning the generous amount of lobster in the poutine. We all dug in. But who cares about that, because I haven't even talked about the seaweed salad. This isn't your typical seaweed salad from those AYCE sushi places (wakame or lettuce topped with thinly sliced kombu). I don't know what it was to be honest... it was just delicious. I think I will have to by it in bulk now - which is an option! 

Little Fin has left a BIG impact on me and I will gladly walk through our Canadian winter just to grab a bite here."}
{"text":"Had an awesome salmon sandwich. Wasn't expecting the bacon so that was a bonus. Their fries and salad is delicious. I will have to come back and try something else off the menu next time."}
{"text":"Prices are high for the quantity of higher-end ingredients actually given.  My large lobster poutine contained only one claw's worth of meat, cut into small chunks.  The lobster grilled cheese was a bit of cheese, mostly \"filler\" type of stuff like diced veggies, and an indiscernible amount of lobster.  Upon first opening, the crispy rock shrimp roll formerly served on a black bun actually contained a decent amount of rock shrimp, but it somehow just lacked that unctuousness that I had expected with a description like \"chili-glazed\".  The black bun, if you're curious about, was nothing major to report either. The charcoal actually felt a little gritty in the mouth, no great difference in the bread texture, and tasted like any regular plain bread.  Not the awesome bakery kind, just a run-of-the-mill type from a grocery store that comes in a bag.

The broccoli was bland and a bit overcooked, with that telltale \"dead\" broccoli colour that verges on the yellow side rather than the deep, bright green you'd expect.  Glad that they're no longer charging for the side sauces though, which they used to sell for a pricey $3 per small plastic sauce container, but I'm not sure that their fancy sauce still contains uni? Tastes more like a mix of mayonnaise and something unidentifiable now (like a less tangy version of Thousand Island dressing). The seaweed salad is a mostly regular greens, with some of the wet seaweed squares you'd typically in powder-mix miso soup.

I really wanted to like Little Fin, but each time it's just somehow been a bit disappointing.  I think it's mainly because for their prices, I expect a POW! of flavour but am met more with a low-five.  A low-five made by baby hands.  I've often been tempted to try their take-out whole lobster dinners with drawn butter, but considering lobsters are pretty darn cheap nowadays and are so simple to make at home, it's difficult to shell out ~$42 (I do love my puns) when I know I can buy one from T&T for $18.  After at least 4 separate visits, I'm sad to say that I probably will be stopping at this..."}
{"text":"Let me just start this review by saying that I'm in love with the fries here! Chunky, crispy wedge potatoes that are seasoned with chicken bullion and lots of garlic. I hate shoestring fries and this restaurant has some of the best wedges I've ever tasted.

The rest of the meal, however, is slightly less amazing. I usually have the chicken BLT ($11 with two sides) which comes on a cute little sesame bun. The burger itself is OK but nothing to write home about. I've had it twice and on both occasions it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, but the chicken was completely lacking in flavour. The bacon and avocado is a nice touch though.

As for the restaurant itself, the decor is quite nice with a fish counter near the kitchen and plenty of seating, inside and out. Most of the lunch items are between $10 and $11, and the lineups can be long. I'd definitely recommend getting here before the lunch rush. The service is fast and friendly and they call your number when your food is ready so you don't have to wait around and hold up the line.

While I haven't tried any of the lobster or fish dishes, what I've tried so far is definitely a three star lunch, especially considering the price. One thing I can't understand is the MASSIVE takeout bags for the small containers of food. Seems like a bit of a waste."}
{"text":"Great little spot with some awesome fish sandwiches.
I had the lobster roll - which was a bit underwhelming but the sides were great.
The lobster roll appears to have a lot of lobster but the bread itself is empty and all the lobster is piled on top - so it is a bit misleading in thinking the sandwich is overflowing with lobster. Having said that, it was a tasty sandwich and there was outdoor seating which was nice to enjoy the weather. Would come back to try out their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and have always been happy with my food. 

Today I ordered haddock sandwich with seaweed salad side and garlic potatoes and was extremely disappointed. 

Haddock was bland and the bread was stale. The potatoes were salty. The seaweed salad tasted literally like wet seaweed - very gross. 

I'm usually one to give places a second chance but I feel like this place has gone down hill. My hubby got fish tacos before and complained how terrible they were and he was simply ignored. They need to care a little more about their product quality and customer service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here originally planning on ordering their lobster roll, but decided against it after reading all the reviews complaining about its tiny lobster portion. However, my colleagues both ordered it, and indeed - there appeared to be a measly amount of lobster.

Instead, I got the seared tuna burger, with a slide of coleslaw and seaweed salad. Let's start with the burger: there was a generous portion of tuna, which was cooked to perfection (raw in the middle). I didn't quite enjoy the spicy mayo sauce though, so I tried my best to smear most of it off. The coleslaw was nice and refreshing, and I appreciated the vinaigrette dressing (sorry folks, I'm just not a fan of mayo). My absolute favorite, however, was the seaweed salad. Definitely special and tasty!!"}
{"text":"I come here once every 2 months and always try to order a different meal. This time around I got the seared tuna sandwich with potato wedges and the seaweed salad. The tuna sandwich was well prepared. It's a simple sandwich with a tartar like sauce. The tuna was not overly seared and the quality of the fish was very decent. The seaweed salad and its dressing were good. It had a good blend of savoury, sweet and sour. In regards to their wedges, they were fried beautifully, but I would definitely lay off some of the seasoning as it makes it extremely salty. Other than that I am a happy customer."}
{"text":"Little fin is a restaurant I have been dying to try since seeing the pictures on Facebook. We went there on my birthday and was super excited to try it.

The place is pretty small with area inside and outside for sitting. A lot of people were ordering take out while we were there.

We ordered the lobster roll (coleslaw and seaweed salad sides) and the crispy haddock sandwich (potato wedge and seaweed salad sides). The food did take a little bit longer to be prepared but the restaurant was pretty busy at the time.

Overall, I found that the crispy haddock sandwich was nicely fried and had great flavour. The sides were also yummy especially the seaweed salad. The lobster roll was okay but I didn't really taste the lobster even though there was an adequate amount.

The prices were slightly above average but I did like how each order came with two sides. I would probably return if I was in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is an offshoot of the Chase, so I had high hopes that were quickly dashed. This is no fast food joint; expect to wait 10 minutes or more for your meal (or call ahead). When I finally received my Mahi with crispy potatoes and slaw, the potatoes were fried crispy and light, but the slaw, fish, and fancy sauce felt like they were painted all with the same brush. If anything, the 'fancy sauce' channeled much less uni and umami, and a lot more thousand island and tartar sauce."}
{"text":"we were fans until today!

they changed their portions. smaller box with smaller sandwich and sides! fries were super salty too. disappointing today."}
{"text":"I really toyed between 3 and 4 stars for this place. 

The \"Meh\"
-portion size
-price
-the lobster roll I got had an unimpressively average bun

The Good
-vibe 
-menu 
-free cucumber water

The Push to 4 Stars
-the seasoning on the potato wedges
-the phenomenal customer service every time I am in there"}
{"text":"Review of their booth at the Adelaide market.  Was disappointed with my $10 fish and chips.  Chips amount of skimpy, potatoes are cheap.  A bit too salty too.  The fish was like that of Highliner fish.  Disappointing and doesn't entice me to try their real storefront."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch due to its convenient location and all the great things I've heard! I ordered the lobster roll which comes with two sides, I got seaweed salad and potato wedges ($16+tax) along with a lemonade ($3).

I wish the lobster roll had more lobster in it, especially for its price... The flavour was good overall but just a few more pieces would make a big difference. The potato wedges were well seasoned but salty! WAY too salty for me! I couldn't even finish them because of how salty they were. 

Originally I thought the seaweed salad would be like the one you get in Japanese restaurants but it's different, more leafy. I liked it! The lemonade also had good flavour- not too sweet or sour. 

Overall, I enjoyed the meal but was not too impressed. They're super busy at lunch time- the line was out the door by noon."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my experience.  I was fooled by all the pictures on Instagram and their website.  

My large order of lobster poutine was 80% fries, 15% cheese, 5% lobster and 0% gravy totalling 100% dryness. To me a poutine should have a healthy ratio of cheese and gravy to fries.  I also need to mention that only the container was large since it was only filled about half way. Not worth $16.

The lobster grilled cheese and lobster hot dog were really yummy but had less lobster than the poutine did. And where was my black sesame bun? 

This place needs to be more consistent with their food. Flavour is there but not the quantity, making it not worth the pricepoint. Probably won't be coming back here again and I wouldn't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick snack before heading to the ACC and decided to finally try Little Fin. We ended up sharing the lobster roll, which came with two sides. We chose the seaweed salad and potato wedges - both were delicious! The portion was very good for the price!  The only complaint I have is that the lobster roll had way too much celery and not enough LOBSTER. Nonetheless, we still enjoyed the meal. They have different specials for every day of the week that start from 5pm onwards. We also like that they have a self serve water station so you don't have to purchase a drink!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food for a place that I thought would be more of a take-out place. They're a bit slow but you get a decent portion of food and there are lots of interesting sides."}
{"text":"I had the crispy haddock sandwich and it tasted very fresh and delicious. I love the garlic aïoli that comes with the fries. It was surprisingly pretty good value. It's too bad the space is is so terrible and antiseptic. Great for takeout but only good to stay in if you can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Cute little store with tasty seafood bites. 
I first saw the lobster poutine picture on BlogTO and knew I had to try it. I tried to not build my hopes up. But I took a bite of the potato wedge, gravy and cheese and knew it would be amazing. With some nice claw meat and generous serving for $14 Id come here again.

We also tried the calamari which was great.  We wanted to try the shrimp Mac and cheese but they had run out -- at least there's an excuse to come again! 

Definitely try it out for some light bites. The place is tiny maybe seats like 10-15 max - but it's perfect for takeout."}
{"text":"The best I can do is 2.5 stars after two visits. Not bad... Not great - just average (and a little pricey for average).

I'm a huge fan of the two main Chase restaurants and return regularly. I had high expectations for Fin as I hoped it would serve as a new work lunch stop. Sadly... It disappoints.

First I had the grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich. These trendy black buns appear to be all the rage in Japan but they are incredibly dry and tasteless. A McDonalds bun would be tastier.  The fish was good and fresh. That said, I prefer the grilled Mahi Mahi at Buster's Sea Cove in the Market. Equally fresh but a bigger portion and a few bucks cheaper. 

I also tried the Seared Tuna - same story as the Mahi Mahi. Salads are not bad but are served with too much dressing. I recommend asking for it on the side. 

Portions are on the small side and your fish, side and a drink will cost $20. 

Service was good but the lunch crowd was light on both my visits. Your food is ready in about 5-7 minutes. They have a number of bar tables to eat on but not a chair / bar stool in sight. And the heat is blasting. Not very enjoyable to eat in the restaurant. 

No real reason to make this a destination for lunch / dinner. I will stick with the main two restaurants. Not sure Fin will have long term success. I'm sure I represent their exact target market but they missed the mark in my opinion.

{"text":"Little Fin has made changes to their menu and let me tell you, it was definitely for the better!  I wonder if we should thank Billy K.?!  :)  Prices have come down.

My husband and I had the fried haddock sandwich with potatoes and we tried the mahi mahi sandwich with slaw.  

The fried haddock was a pretty big portion.  The mahi mahi was definitely smaller, but it was still enough food.  When the bread is toasted and buttered, it makes a world of difference!  Both meals were very well made, tasty, and worth it at this price point.  Everything was $20.  We were quite happy with our lunches."}
{"text":"I like this place generally, but the Southwest Mahi Mahi salad is mostly (85%) rice without much flavour despite not including any mention of grains in the menu description on Ritual. I was really hoping for a healthy lunch and am very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Cozy spot on Temperance, squeezed between eternal favorites, Dineen and Chase, Little Fin is my go to for a quick seafood weekday lunch. Crispy haddock and the soba noodle salad are fantastic. Get a fresh pressed juice too, never disappoints."}
{"text":"Alright, this place looks good inside, nice friendly staff and quick service, That being said, my first experience was not the greatest, i went in to give it a try on march 3rd, and decided to try what appeared to be a good looking buffalo chicken sandwich, i know, i know why am i ordering chicken at a fish joint? well it was their special and it looked really good, I did go in for fish, but the image of that chicken sammy changed my mind, The chicken was cooked well  and served on a nice fresh bun, The flavour just wasn't there though. the flavouring was weak  and thrown off by the fact they used thigh meat instead, which was mostly dark meat. It gave the sandwich an odd texture and flavour overall. I can't say it was all that tasty as again the thigh meat just made it taste weird  and made the texture weird. I was really unsatisfied with my choice to be honest. they really need to use white meat on that sammy, the sandwich also came with fries and coleslaw. the fries were good, but they gave me very few fries to be honest. honestly it was no more than a handful of wedges (not fresh cut either), the coleslaw was also disappointing, really heavy on red onions, which dominated the flavour, to the point it was just too strong and inedible. it was pretty bad to be honest. Overall my experience here was disappointing $15 for food i could barely finish is not a good value. I will however try them again for their fish and hopefully they can redeem themselves with their specialty. I will stay away from that slaw though, as it was just wrong and overpowered with an immense amount of red onion. It was also disappointing to see they use frozen fries as well. As one does expect a fried fish shop to have fresh cut double fried french fries. That's just traditional and expected. And if you have to use frozen fries, at least give us a decent amount!! Very disappointing experience but i will give them one more chance. so stay tuned for an update to this review folks."}
{"text":"Had the lobster roll which was prepared \"New England style\". Being from New England, this lobster roll was the furthest thing from it. Barely any lobster at all on a sesame seed stale bun. Photo looks amazing but is the opposite. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best food for your go to quick and tasty seafood joint! Their crispy haddock sandwich is amazing! Definitely worth a try! You'll just keep going back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a work lunch - the patio is especially nice in the summer or you can always do takeout. 

I love the lobster roll (a bit on the pricey side) and just tried the seared tuna sandwich. Both are delicious! Their seaweed salad is unique and not like anything I've got elsewhere. The potato wedges are also deliciously seasoned, albeit a bit salty after having a lot. 

It's a bit on the pricey side, but pretty standard for a financial district lunch place. Oh and they're also open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced. Huge take out bag is not very environmentally friendly in this day and age. 

Crab roll was ok. Tiny, no sides. Was lump meat, not minced which is its only redeeming quality. Tasted like frozen crab and not freshly cracked. 

Black bun is a novelty. Didn't add much to taste. 

Overrated. I hope this isn't a trend for how to do seafood. 

Lobster hotdog is as disappointing as it sounds. Has the originality of my 5 year old nephew."}
{"text":"How are you guys giving this place 4/5 stars? Have you not eaten at any other seafood joint in Toronto? Seven Lives? Even the fish taco at Grand electric? Or rock lobster? I got the poutine which was a mistake using wedges. Not 'unique' - just plain poor surface area when using wedges. Its like gravy and boiled potatoes. Sprinkle of lobster which was also only OK. Poor value and disappointed. Also ordered the fried haddock which looked like costco chicken fingers - thick, hard batter with a thin piece of fish inside. Cmon thats not how you do fried fish guys."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The lobster hot dog had a dry bun, very little lobster, and the hot dog wasn't good quality either. 

I had one of those promo cards when they first opened - half off for a lobster dog. Still came out to almost 10 bucks...

Even with half off, it was super overpriced for what it was. Cute packaging and neat concept, but the food just doesn't cut it. The lobster hot dog was tiny, and I was still hungry afterwards.

I came around the time that they opened, so maybe they've improved since then. But I certainly don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment with little fin today. I've been to Little Fin many times before but haven't came back since maybe half a year.. menu has changed and only limited amount of items are on their menu now (no more lobster poutine or calamari!!!) Decided to try their ceviche tacos and what a sad decision...

I expected colour and lots of tuna in this taco, instead.. i had maybe at most 2 small chopped piece of tuna, with lots of jalapeno... the soft taco shell itself tasted quite stale and the whole ceviche seemed to be marinated in a mayo type dressing. Was truly unimpressed. Fries and seaweed salad was their only saving grace. I would not advise you to order the tacos unless you want stale taco shells with lots of cabbage and barley any fish!

Now it makes me wonder whether management has changed... either way, I don't think i will be returning to little fin again anytime soon especially with their limited menu."}
{"text":"Maybe my favourite lobster roll in the city. The seared tuna sandwich is delicious too. I usually order my sandwiches with a side of seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Little Fin is a windswept white, lighthousesque, little spot serving sustainable seafood meals at reasonable prices. Notable for an array of marine driven bites, the sandwiches and burgers are all pre-combo'd with a choice of sides. Predominately decked-out with rail seating and high, narrow tables, Little Fin caters to the \"faster\" diner in us.

The feeling is comfortable, clean and inviting- a great atmosphere to be in while chowing down on delicately prepared seafood. 

The menu is smart and uncomplicated. The only complex thing about it is carefully selecting only one item for your meal, everything sounds great. I had a difficult time myself, so I took the plunge and tried a bunch of things- just can't help myself.

On my Menu: 
The Big Eye Tuna Sandwich
The Crispy Haddock Sandwich
The Surf n' Turf Fin Burger
The Lobster Poutine 
All sides including Crispy Potatoes, Seaweed Salad, Garden Slaw

Favourites: The Big Eye Tuna
Why: Seared and kept rare in the centre. Seasoned well, sauce is bomb.

Favourites: Crispy Haddock
Why: You're able to taste the freshness of the fish despite it being fried. Moist and tender, sauce is bomb, again.

Favourite Side: Seaweed Salad
Why: Asian dressing kills it, pairs well with seaweed

Honorable Mention: Lobster Poutine
Why: It's pretty expensive for the portion and would have liked a bit more lobster but the chunks were super tender and good sized. As for a poutine, it's pretty good.

The service was very friendly and helpful. I felt that the recommendations were perfect and I felt comfortable during my meal despite eating 2 regular meals to myself...

Well priced fresh seafood, properly prepared, tasty with great sides."}
{"text":"Food is pretty delicious but portions are tiny for the price. 

My go to's here are the lobster roll, fried chicken sandwich, lobster poutine and garlic potato wedges. Note that I havent been since the summer time and it seems they no longer offer the lobster poutine on their menu. A shame!

Not much seating space especially with long lines during the work week lunch hours make it a meal that you most likely have to take back to the office with you."}
{"text":"Had he haddock sandwich with sides of coleslaw and seaweed salad. Costed $13 which seemed pretty fair. 

Both salads were very solid. 

The sandwich was good as well. Fish was fried well and the bun was delicious. It was very small though, so I was a bit disappointed there. 

All in all I enjoyed the lunch, just wish the sandwich was a bit bigger"}
{"text":"This is a small little shop with no more than 20 bar stool seats. We came on a Friday night after work which was early just before 5pm. It wasn't busy at all 3 people in front of us. We were craving for seafood and wanted to try their lobster roll and shrimp tacos. They each came with two sides. We ordered the slaw and wedges with spicy siracha mayo sauce as dipping and that was good. The lobster roll came with seaweed salad and spicy broccoli. We paid extra for the broccoli. They were large pieces and it had the right amount of spice with just a little kick. Now onto my along awaited lobster roll...I love seafood and let me tell you I was quite disappointed with the taste but more importantly the size. It was abit larger than a dinner role For a meal that cost $16.00 I was expecting a bit more. The lobster didn't have much taste...I tasted the dill and mayo more than the lobster itself. The shrimp tacos were the highlight for us. It had jalapeño and hickory sticks along with lettuce and tomatoes...it was really tasty and the hickory sticks gave it a nice crunch. They have specials everyday after 5pm. Overall it was a decent meal if you're looking for something quick...grab n go and craving for a seafood fix. It's located right beside The Chase restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the CHG establishments. They have different atmospheres in each restaurant which caters to different crowds while managing value.

I decided to try their breakfast menu....yes i said BREAKFAST. I spent around $8 for Chicken and waffles sandwich and a small coffee. Bang for your buck compared to similar prices around the area. 

Also, its not your average breakfast items. So spice up your mornings ;)

Tip#1: You can call ahead of time to place your order and pick up
Tip#2: DON'T trust the coffee lids! spilt coffee guarantee! (or maybe it was just mine) 
Tip#3: *praise the lord there's a fried egg in the sandwich! Ask them for overeasy if you don't want it over hard."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with some coworkers that had been before and raved about it.  I'm typically the one complaining about spending anything over $5 for food, but I will pay up for Little Fin!  We shared the large lobster poutine (delicious, lots of cheese and gravy, lots of big lobster chunks), and I had the tuna burger with the seaweed salad and potatoes.  The seaweed salad is delicious, and the seasoning sprinkled on the potatoes is amazing as well.  Not too spicy, not too salty, just delicious.  The ahi tuna was very big pieces and not mealy -- good, fresh fish in my sandwich.  I will be coming back, hopefully one time I'll be lucky enough to snag a seat on their patio!"}
{"text":"Had the Fried Chicken BLT with the seaweed salad side.  Disappointed.  Chicken batter was burnt, couldn't taste the yogurt jalapeño marinate and there was perhaps two pieces of seaweed of what looks like a mostly green salad. The long wait was expected but the poor quality was not.  Girl at the cash was very pleasant though.  Might try again but maybe not during lunch hour rush."}
{"text":"Wow I was extremely extremely disappointed with my visit to little fin. I as excited to try the black bun that you keep seeing advertised and the fresh lobster menu items. To my disappointment there was no black buns, the Lobster Poutine we ordered had no gravy and lack of lobster, the grilled cheese lobster had 3 pieces of lobster. The item I enjoyed most was the lobster hotdog but I was still a little turned off by the disappointment form the other items we ordered. I'm not sure if the lobster poutine was supposed to have gravy but it was dry. 

The location and store is nice and clean but very small so it's very crowded at lunch. Don't expect to have a table. Best to order and go or standup table"}
{"text":"I didn't know that making a smoked salmon bagel ($6.78) takes more than 10 minutes, but apparently at Little Fin, it does! I went in to the restaurant before 10:30 (that was the time that my order was entered) and left well after 10:40. 
I'd also like to mention that although it is not mandatory to make food with gloves, I think it looks better to customers. The gentleman making my sandwich was running all around the kitchen, getting supplies (bagel, smoked salmon, cream cheese, lettuce) for my sandwich. He touched utensils, the fridge door, and god knows what else WITHOUT washing his hands before touching my food. 
Needless to say I'm beyond grossed out and will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"When I was there, there was no line. The cashier recommended the crispy haddock and I took her advice. I didn't realize that the sandwich, side order and a drink would be SO MUCH! Honestly it was too big!!! I couldn't finish it. The sandwich was pretty yummy. I would come again."}
{"text":"Came in today for a lobster roll.
Sorely disappointed in the portion.  Roll indeed, it wasn't much bigger than a dinner roll & nowhere near the size of (now closed) Rock Lobster or Busters in the St Lawrence Mkt at a similar price point.
Quality wise -it seems that there is more mayo & celery in it than lobster - I'd be astounded if there was more than 3 oz of actual lobster which at a price of $16 represents appalling value.  I prefer actual pieces of lobster rather than a minced lobster salad on a bun (which wasn't ultra fresh either) but when you're giving so little volume, that must be how they stretch it out.
To be fair the potato wedges were good although a tad soggy (I did come in after lunch hour & had a 5 minute walk home) & the slaw was good (& abundant).  But I had a hankering for lobster not sides.
Also the girl on the counter was oblivious. When asked whether I wanted the garden slaw or seaweed salad, I said that I couldn't remember when I had ever had seaweed.  I thought that might prompt her to offer to put a teaspoon full in the little container they use for side sauce (effectively a nickels worth).  But she didn't & still didn't get it when I directly mentioned that I would have appreciated a small sample.  Went right back to chatting with the grill guy.
All in all, a poor experience. As they're only two blocks from my condo might give them one last chance on perhaps the haddock & chips.  But I see that is $13.75 & may not represent better value than today's fiasco."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. The staff is extremely nice and service was really fast. 
 
Ordered the Surf'n Turf. It was very filling and loved every bite of it. 

Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot, really great patio space. Kitchen makes it way too hot to sit inside in the summer. 

The service was wonderful, staff was really friendly. The food however was not all worth the price tag. 

Sandwich combo was good, decent amount of lobster and sizeable sides. The bun was a bit meh. Not quite as buttery and toasted as you would expect, and a little too much \"filler lettuce\". Lobster was really good though. 

Lobster poutine came in a huge container but portion was a little sad. Portion of lobster meat was decent, but for $16 I'd expect a bit more lobster or more fries at the very least. 

In the end, a good meal. Free infused water was a nice touch. May come back in the future to try other things."}
{"text":"I'm basing this on solely the Lobster Poutine (~$14) but it was phenomenal. There is a lot for one person so I recommend sharing this with someone if you dont want to feel like crap in a few hours. The garlic wedge potatoes were soft and fluffy and they have this cajun/barbeque seasoning. The gravy & cheese was light, but not runny. They even threw in a bonus of green onion slivers!! There were sugar-cubed chunks of lobster claw meat (namely the claw) which was fresh! It's great to try once so 

It's a tiny restaurant, supposedly for takeout within the financial district, but there is still tables where you can sit down! Self-serve water station, wifi available."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews I decided to drop by this place for lunch. 

I wasn't in the mood for a full fry up but thankfully they have some nice alternative choices. I opted for the Mahi Mahi Salad. It was lightly dressed and full of good ingredients like kale, wheat berry, rice, barley, beans, broccoli, cucumber and tomato. The fish was nicely grilled and still moist. Not a huge portion of fish but, along with the salad, was more than satisfying for a lunch time meal. 

Next time I'll have a fry up as it looked amazing. 

Cute decor with limited seating, clean establishment.  Friendly service.  Well worth a visit when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Want a quick seafood lunch place while in the Financial District?  Little Fin is the place to go!

I came here on two separate occasions already and both time I really enjoyed the food.  This place is very small, so it is an in and out place.

I had their haddock sandwich and it was very tasty as the fish was very crispy, meat was tender and fresh!  I also tried their burger and it was very juicy!  The sauce that comes with both sandwiches was a perfect combination.  Both sandwich options do come with two sides and I highly recommend their seaweed salad to be selected for at least one of your two options.

Out of their whole menu, I would say the Lobster Poutine is a MUST try.  Poutine with big chucks of lobster meat!! What else can you ask for?!

The reason why I gave it 4/5 only is because their food prices are a little pricey for lunch and I though most of their food options were fried, which give very limited selections for people who are on a diet."}
{"text":"Picked up two TravelZoo vouchers for this place. $10 for $20 worth of food is not bad. There is very limited seating as this seems like its more for take-out rather than dining in.  I came here with my boyfriend and tried their lobster poutine, seaweed salad, and lobster grilled cheese. 

The lobster poutine was alright although I have had better at Rock Lobster. I did not like that the fries were wedges instead of straight cut fries. The regular price for a large poutine is $16! Not worth it if you were paying without a voucher. I also found a piece of what looked like a piece of very fine black hair. I did not complain and just took it out and ate it. Didn't think it could be anything bad since their kitchen is pretty much in the same space you are dining in.  

Their seaweed salad was pretty good though there was too much dressing. I ordered a small and it was quite a bit of food.

I took a couple bits of the grilled cheese and would say that was the best thing I ate there."}
{"text":"Little Fin reached out to me, asking if I would like to check them out on the house. Located right next to The Chase, Little Fin is more of a take out place. However, there is a few seats available. Maybe like 10ppl capacity? Rough estimate. I brought a friend along and we tried the following dishes: 

- Shrimp Mac and Cheese
Strong taste of herbs, but it's really good. I like it. I just don't know about the portion, I think for the price ($13) it should be about double that. 
- Calamari Po'boy: has side options of wedge potatoes and slaw or seaweed salad. Sandwich was good too and had corn and spicy mayo in it. Unique but spicy combination. 
- Calamari Bites: They were really good and yummy with sauce. 
- Seaweed Salad: Surprisingly really liked this one. Their dish is a mix of greens, tomatoes and seaweed. When I think of seaweed salad though, I always think of the Japanese style more. Lol. 
- Chili Spiced Broccoli: It's more salty and less spicy then I expected. Too soft, overcooked? 
- Shipwreck Salad: it was ok and hugely portioned. Healthy. They have a nice avocado sauce and shrimp on it. 
- Lobster Roll: I really want to like it but it had too much mayo and herbs on it. I also would have liked the bun to be a bit more hotter. To get that nice contrast of hot bun and cold lobster. Idk, but that's my ideal lobster roll preference. Lol. 

Overall, I would recommend the Seaweed Salad, Shrimp Mac n' Cheese, Calamari Bites and the Po'Boy. I heard the poutine and haddock might be worth checking out too. Customer service here is nice and friendly. They have free lemon water available while you eat too. If there were any improvements to be made, I think bathrooms could be a bit bigger. Bathrooms are too small if you need wheelchair access. Also, it would be a nice touch if there was some bag hooks under tables and a few coat hooks on the the wall for customers."}
{"text":"Love this cute place. Came here for lunch and we had the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with double seaweed salad ( you get 2 sides) and the Crispy Haddock with crispy potatoes and slaw.

Both were cooked perfectly, especially the Crispy Haddock.
Service was very fast. Great fresh food even when you have a short lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Found a Little Fin booth at the open market Downtown and opted for their fish (haddock) and chips with coleslaw special for $14. Both the fish and chips were very crispy and definitely freshly made. The tartar sauce was not homemade and simply prepackaged, which was definitely very disappointing. The coleslaw fell rather flat in comparison, but nonetheless cold and refreshing on a hot summer day. Their prices seemed to be fair and consistent for seafood and for typical open market prices."}
{"text":"I have been to Little Fin twice in the past year and I have to say each time I was disappointed with my experience. The restaurant offers fresh fish right in the heart of the Financial District, but I have not been happy with the service it provides.

The first time I went for lunch with co-workers. Given that this is a very busy place during lunch, the line was understandably long but we decided to wait it out. Although we understood that it would take a longer time to order, it seemed that the cashiers/servers were operating very slowly, chatting and not preparing the take out bags which further delayed the process. Altogether it took 30-40 minutes to order and get our lunches. Since I work in the financial district and often eat out for lunch, this is a ridiculous amount of time to get your food. They also did not provide my food in take-out bag even though I specified take-out while ordering.

The second time I went for a quick take-out dinner, hoping the service would improve. The food also took a long time after ordering despite the restaurant being empty, but I was mostly disappointed because they did not give me the sides that I had ordered, which I only realized when I got home. It seemed as though my order was placed wrong every time I came to Little Fin.

As I said the fish is fresh and well prepared. Personally I am not a fan of the sides (the soba noodles are cold and hard) and the prices are higher than average. After my experiences here, I will not be visiting Little Fin anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced frozen lobster meat and salty gravy on the poutine is disappointing with different fries on 2 orders and the roll is just so so. When you see a full tank of lives lobsters you do not expect to be served frozen one."}
{"text":"I came here after noticing it when I ate at The Chase. It's a casual fish and chips restaurant with limited seating. I came here during dinner hours on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all. It seems more like a lunch place since they do not open till late night. I ordered the haddock sandwich and my friend got the lobster roll. I enjoyed my sandwich but nothing really impressed me. I will probably return to try other items another time. It is a decent place if you are nearby but don't go out of your way to coke here."}
{"text":"Slightly expensive, not your everyday lunch fishing. I ordered the grilled shrimps (special that day) and was slightly surprised that i had to fish for the shrimps in the salad box (only 4 average sized pieces). The shrimps were marinated and done well but wasn't enough and had to grab a Starbucks frap on the way back to make it during the rest of the day. Should've judged from the men in suits lined up outside that this was just not my everyday spot"}
{"text":"Small, tucked away place but great stop for quality food.

The place is small and only has bar stools but the staff are super helpful and friendly. 

I went here with my parents and each of us had the Travelzoo coupon ($10 for $20) which was a definite steal. I ordered the Lobster Poutine (large) which was a good lunch portion and not super salty like many other places. They used crispy wedge-like potato pieces, which I definitely prefer over thin fries and there were also a decent amount of lobster pieces. The cashier recommended we dip our potatoes in their secret \"fancy sauce\" which had a unique, yummy flavor. My mom got the Surf n' Turf Burger which was a mid-size portion - the lobster pieces definitely complemented the patty. My dad got the Lobster Grilled Cheese which was a good blend of cheese, lobster and other ingredients with tasty bread - it was also a little sweet. Both their meals came with coleslaw which they raved about. We also shared a side of seaweed salad which was a good mix of seaweed and other leafy greens, though a little salty.

Overall food was fresh and delicious! Definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the Financial District."}
{"text":"Little Fin is great for a quick lunch at the Financial district. 
Service was excellent. I found it funny how the cashier told me it would take specifically 6 minutes to make my crispy haddock haha

CRISPY HADDOCK - coleslaw and fries on the side
Yummy! The piece of haddock in my burger was actually pretty huge.. was so full afterwards.. will need to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Little Fin, we ordered our lunch from here. 

I got the Haddock, chips and slaw ($14). It was surprisingly flavourful and 3 pieces were just perfect. The coleslaw was refreshing, not too dressed in sauce. These fish and chips were satisfying. The Lobster Roll, chips and slaw ($16) received positive feedback, delicious with a good portion of lobster.
It was filling, we were perfectly stuffed!

The fries were a bit on the salty side and didn't hold up their crispiness for long. Overall, we were very satisfied with the food here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place and I can't wait to go back.  I went around 1:30/2pm on a weekday and the place was PACKED!  That being said, the wait time isn't that long for your order, and the turn over was pretty quick to get a seat.  

I had the crispy haddock sandwich with comes with 2 sides.  I got the garlic wedges and house salad, which is more like a coleslaw.  I liked both.  The wedges had a lot of flavour and were good dipped in the tarter sauce - careful it's a bit spicy.

The food was fresh, and you could see the live lobsters for the rolls - my next meal there!

Prices weren't bad and you get a lot of food.  

Free water was nice too."}
{"text":"Sooo good!!! Haddock sandwich was so filling, had a zesty sauce that gave the sandwich a kick, lightly fried crispy enough to keep you salivating but not oily enough to make it greasy after the third bite. My biggest fear for seafood is dry and a fishy taste and smell with it. Didn't happen here and main was really fresh which I loved. Potato sides were slightly on the salty side but the seasoning and Cajun mix on it was phenomenal. Especially hot out of the oven where it's crispy on the outside and lightly golden with soft potato timidly waiting within. The seaweed salad was refreshing and had fresh greens mixed in so the texture was very well done and balanced out the entire meal with the deep friend haddock and potato wedges. 

Mahi Mahi meat was more dry, and salad mix underneath was a bit bland for my taste but definitely a more healthier dish by far! Different textures with the fried chips on top and the beans and greens underneath which is both aesthetically pleasing to look and taste. 

I really enjoyed it, clean sit down areas, nice theme and blue decor, food was fresh and appetizing, location easily accessible though no parking given its down town, and great value for the portion size. Approx $13 for two sides and filling sandwich. Yummy in my tummy and a must try."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant. Came here for lunch, filled up pretty fast. Ordered a ahi tuna sandwich. They had gluten free bread which was great. The bread was a bit too thick though, I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"This was our first time and finding it was a little tough. Its around the corner from yonge street on temperance, right before chase. There is limited on street parking but fairly close to eatons centre. 

I ordered the Crispy Haddock and it came with two sides. I ordered a side of seaweed salad and potatoes (which are basically potatoe wedges). I thoroughly enjoyed the seaweed salad. It had larger strands of seaweed as opposed the way you get them at ayce japanese sushi restaurants. Its mixed in with sone greens, tomatoes and cucumber. It was a nice contrast to the haddock.

My best way of describing the crispy haddock was think if a glorified fillet o fish. It was definitely satisfying but I would say it falls short for a $12 sandwich. Also good to note that the Crispy haddock was marked as $9 on their website menu. The potatoes wedges were tasty but a bit on the salty side. I think it was intended to offset the sandwich and the salad.

My wife ordered the lobster poutine and it had some good sized lobster pieces. Not enough for the amount of wedges but when you got a piece, the flavor exploded in your mouth. A little bit on the salty side if you didn't get any lobster.

We also ordered crispy calamari bites. They were tasty with the sauce, but nothing overly special. 

The wait staff were very friendly and provided excellent service. The food was also served very quickly. We ate there and everything was very clean.

I would go back again if we were walking in the area and was craving fish and chips, but probably wouldn't make a huge effort to go."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday afternoon.....ghost town. 
3 staff behind the counter snapped to attention when we walked in, like they were just waiting for someone to come in so they could look busy.

Ordered, then waited outside on the patio. Once we got out onto the patio, we noticed none of the tables on the patio were cleaned and all the chairs were all over. My partner had to go in and get a rag to clean our table off. Sadly, another set of customers did the same thing, and had to clean their own outside table off.
I would have assumed if the staff had nothing to do inside while they waited for customers, maybe making the outside look presentable might have been an option. 
I should probably learn not to assume stuff, huh?!

Food was meh. Had the lobster roll which wasn't anything spectacular, and the accompanying fries were a little too spiced for my liking. My partner had the fish and chips and was surprised that it didn't come with tarter sauce (standard, no?) and instead came with a spicy mayo sauce which we weren't sure what it was for, since the fries were already pretty spicy.
Again, the food was pretty mediocre and pretty pricey.

I wouldn't say that there was anything special about Little Fin, and wouldn't venture back nor recommend."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch with a coworker last week. Quite good!

It's very small inside, there is seating for probably 15 people, max. But we got in quite early (12pm) so there was still some seating left. 

Disappointed when we ordered, as we both wanted the fried chicken BLT, and she told us they only had one left. But you guys open at 11am.. you were able to sell out within an hour? But I guess it turned out for the better, cuz then we decided to try the calamari po boy and share the two sandwiches so we can try both. The calamari po boy was the winner. It was seasoned so nicely, and nice and crunchy. The chicken was good too, but a little bland. 

We opted for the garlic wedges and coleslaw. Both were so good! I've heard the seaweed salad is great too, so I'll give that a shot next time."}
{"text":"Came him to have a quick dinner. Pleasant and friendly service but food was mediocre.  Ordered lobster blt roll and big eye tuna burger (with fries and slaw). Portions are small and the taste was just ok. Not much lobster and had more fillers  in the roll. For the price you will pay for a meal for 2 here, we suggest you go somewhere else for better seafood."}
{"text":"Small little shop. What enticed us to go in was the lobster in the tank as odd as it sounds. It's amazing how they can keep the restaurant so neat and decorated. 

The sandwiches and the lobster roll was solid. You have the option of seaweed salad or garden. I liked both personally. They come with potato wedges. You can also get it to go. Also heard they change their menu up throughout the seasons.

I would not mind coming here again. My new profile pic is now of me taking picture of the food at little fun. Hoorah."}
{"text":"The large lobster poutine is ridiculously large! Perfect to share with a friend. However, the potatoes could've been sliced thinner. I felt like I was stuffing a quarter potato into my mouth with each bite.

And that decor though! Too cute ! Almost went back just for the photo opp."}
{"text":"Tried Little Fin today for lunch, and will definitely come back =)
I love fish and chips and thought this place was a good place to go if you had the cravings and wanted a quick bite.
I got the crispy haddock sandwich which comes with your choice of two of the three sides (wedges, seaweed salad, or slaw). It cost around $13-14 with the tax which is decent, considering that it is in the financial district. I got the wedges and slaw today but next time I will definitely try the seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"We came here for the lobster roll and was super disappointed that they ran out. We opted for the seared tuna sandwich which was delicious. The fish was very fresh and the sauce was the perfect compliment. We also got the fish and chips which totally hit the spot. By the way the potato wedges are super addicting."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday and enjoyed the salmon burger along with the fires and coleslaw. The seaweed salad was refreshing and different from how we always get in sushi places . Its a. Must try!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Tucked away in the midst of the bustle off Yonge Street, located just northwest of Yonge and Adelaide, in between The Chase and Dineen Coffee, I stopped by for lunch on a Thursday around 11:30 AM. Little Fin has a very casual vibe, with communal tables, counters, and stools - it's like an upscale, seafood-oriented McDonald's - you order at the counter, grab your food, and find a seat! 

Despite the casual atmosphere, the traces of trendiness are still there - decor is charming and skillfully put together (the colour scheme jumps right out at you when you first walk in, and the take-out bags are very well-designed!).

Be warned, Part I - come early (or after peak lunch hour), or you'll be waiting awhile for your food and scouring for a table. The place was empty when I first came in, but by the time I left around 12:00 PM, this popular lunch spot was packed. Be warned, Part II - this place is NOT accessible via the PATH (as of the date of this review, anyway), so you'll have to walk outside to get here.

I ordered the Haddock & Chips for lunch, and I actually really enjoyed it! The batter wasn't thick like most fish & chips places lean towards - instead, the fish was covered thinly in a mix of bread crumbs and batter. The fish itself wasn't too fishy, and combined with the batter, had a wonderful crunch and texture. The chips were decent and crispy, covered in a mix of cajun spice rub that was surprisingly delicious. I really enjoyed my meal.

I'll definitely drop by again to try their sandwiches (I saw someone stuffing themselves with the haddock sandwich, and I vowed to come back for it!). 

For my meal, with no drink, I paid $14.00 + tax = $15.80."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something new to try in the Financial District, Little Fin is the place to go. Service was amazing (shout out to Jaden who walked to each table and serviced every customer). 

My friend and I opted for the small and large lobster poutine, $12 and $16 respectively. Our orders took quite some time to get ready but to be fair, it was quite busy. 

The lobster poutine was delicious with the right amount of gravy and cheese. The lobster was really fresh as well. However, the amount of lobster in the poutine was slightly disappointing on both sizes. In addition, it was hard to see the difference between a small and large poutine. The large poutine was simply a larger container with almost the same amount of fries. We would recommend getting the small lobster poutine because it did NOT look worth an extra $4 more.

Would come back to try the surf n turf burger!"}
{"text":"Great little seafood spot in the heart of the core that doesn't break the bank. My boyfriend and I easily ate here for $20.00. And free lemon water! Hooray! Space was a little tight, but we managed to grab seats by the window. 

I ordered the rock shrimp sandwich with potatoes and slaw and my boyfriend got the lobster hot dog. 

What I liked:

- Rock shirmp sandwich rocked. So good. I'm always concerned with sandwiches like this or burgers that the buns would get too soggy. This bun was toasted just enough that it didn't get soggy from the sweet chili sauce. 

- Seaweed salad. So good! Reminded me of the spinach salad from Guu. 

- Free lemon water! 

And things I didn't really like:

- Fries. Definitely a personal preference as I like crispy, shoestring fries and these were big wedges. It was a good handful of potatoes so I'm just being finicky. 

- Slaw was too sour. Get the Seaweed salad instead. Seaweed and greens with a nice sesame dressing. 

- I wish there were self-serve ketchup dispensers instead of ketchup packets. I understand that most of the crowd here orders take-out lunch Monday-Friday, but it would be nice to have more ketchup so those big wedges.

- Not enough lobster on the hot dog. 

Overall, I'd like to come back and try out the rest of the menu.Thanks for the great lunch, Little Fin!"}
{"text":"Delicious food for a cheap price! Wish the portions were bigger but you get what you pay for. Environment is clean and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Got take out for lunch at Little Fin today. It was my first time there and the cashier recommended the haddock sandwich. I took his recommendation and the sandwich also comes with the choice of two sides, so I got the garden slaw and seaweed salad. It came to $12 + tax which is reasonable considering its downtown. The sandwich tasted amazing and the sides were pretty good too! The only downfall is the sandwich is a bit small. But all in all it was all very delicious, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing experience at Arctic Bites and I have to say, I was so glad I dropped by.

I got their Lobster Roll and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. Came with two sides and I got the seaweed salad and the potato wedges. The Lobster Roll was full of lobster and it reminded me of ones that I had in Eastern Canada. The roll had a generous amount of lobster in it, and the sauce they served on the side complimented both my roll and the wedges.

Total was about $18.10 (the lobster roll was $16). Totally worth it for sure!

Will definitely be coming by more often & recommending to friends!"}
{"text":"This is such an adorable little lunch spot for me. It's right next to Dineen coffee on Temperance St. When you walk in you will see cute blue decor. They changed up their menu a bit recently. When I came for my first visit, we tried lobster poutine and lobster BLT. I felt that the lobster dishes didn't have enough lobster on it. I guess this is expected when you're paying $16+. It seems like others have had better luck getting a generous amount of meat on their dishes. 

Second time I've been here I had the crispy haddock sandwich. I absolutely love this sandwich. It's seasoned well and just delicious. I usually pair it with the seaweed salad (also super yummy) and their potato wedges. I tried the coleslaw and though it was a little too sour for my taste. Their chowder before used to be really good, I believe it was some sort of seafood and sweet potato chowder. They changed it to a corn and fish chowder and I'm not a fan. Quality went down there. Everything else I've had has been good. If you want to try something for the first time, go with the crispy haddock sandwich. I will definitely be back there for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came back to little fin and got the soba noodles. I came here twice in a week because of how much I loved this dish!! It was so flavorful with the tangy vinegarette, vibrant with the peppers, purple cabbage, and edamame, and crunchy with the combination of different vegetables. Getting it alone is good enough for me, but you can also add $5 for tuna. I added tuna on my second trip here in the week and found it delicious but pretty pricy for the amount you're getting and paying for. When I come back for the soba noodles I'll do without the tuna. Highly recommend this dish, it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I was once a big fan of Little Fin but now if I could give it a negative rating I would.

If you decide to eat at any establishment owned by the http://chasehg.com/ #chasehg which includes the http://littlefin.ca/ #littlefin then you may want to consider the following. My wife and I had a nice evening planned to have a quick meal then catch Wynton Marsalis at Massey Hall. We decided to eat at Little Fin ordering the lobster poutine and double burger. After initial discomfort, a few hours after the meal we both became ill and missed most of the concert because of food poisoning. For people who know me, I am very specific about what I eat so the only thing out of the ordinary that day was my meal at Little Fin.

I sent an email to Nigel Wright, the Little Fin executive chef about the incident and initially he was responsive only to stop all communications. He advised that he self-reports Little Fin to Toronto Health but to my surprise Toronto Health came more than a week later. The Toronto Health advisors told me to never allow restaurants to self-report as it will never happen or will drag out the inspection. A week would allow anyone to clean up any mess so not surprisingly here is the final communication from Alexis Davis who took over communication for Chasehg. This email was in response to a list of expenses I incurred due to the food poisoning. Strange that the #ChaseHospitalityGroup takes no responsibility over the food poisoning and then offers compensation.

Thank you so much for your understanding. I spoke to the food inspector and they told me that they do not have any reason to believe that the illness that you and your wife experienced was due to food eaten at Little Fin as they found no evidence of any mishandling of food or contaminated product. As a result, while we will of course compensate you for the cost of your meals that day, I am not able to authorize payment for the other items on your list. That being said, I very much hope that you will accept a gift card from us so that we can host you and your wife to dinner in one of our other restaurants. I promise that at this time we will do everything possible to show how much we appreciate the fact that you chose to give us a second chance.
Please let me know when we can speak next to arrange the above.
All the best,
ALEXIS DAVIS | DIRECTOR OF TALENT AND CULTURE

Since I don't remember having food poisoning since maybe my childhood, here are my lessons learned:
1. If you eat at this establishment they will take their time with due diligence and take no accountability.
2. NEVER allow restaurants to self-report and don't email the restaurant.
3. Immediately call Toronto Public Health and they will act on the issue and also get other departments involved to get samples and hold restaurants to account.
4. Maybe I should just brown bag it =)"}
{"text":"Place is pretty overrated. The haddock sandwich is decent, the seaweed salad is pretty gross, and the potatoes are okay. Relatively good deal in financial district considering it is only $9. The ahi tuna sandwich is okay, but nothing special either."}
{"text":"Biggest letdown of the year for me! You might be confused by the 4-star rating so lets get started. The first time I'd heard about this place was from Instagram and the sight of the black bun burgers intrigued me to such an infinite degree. Most of my wardrobe is black and I enjoy black coffee so I guess it was time to take it to the next step with a black burger. 

The location of Little Fin is definitely convenient - only a few steps away from Eaton's Center. I tried the chicken BLT while my dining companion went for the salmon burger. All their burgers were reasonably priced and come with potato wedges and your choice of salad. We sat at one of their tables and waited eagerly for our orders. Upon receiving them, one standout: they weren't black! We asked the waitress/ cashier and she actually explained that the black charcoal buns were deemed \"too dry\" by a lot of customers so they switched over to potato buns. 

Aside from that disappointment, the food was pretty good. The fried chicken in my burger was juicy and crispy though the whole thing was a little messy to eat. It was pretty hard to be a lady with that so I ended up using a fork and knife near the end, it wasn't any easier though. The seaweed salad was interesting since it wasn't your typical Asian seaweed slaw while the potatoes were a little below average. I found them to be under-cooked and couldn't finish. 

Overall, it was a decent, clean and efficient place. The black buns were a novelty for me and without them, they're kind of just another burger-based place."}
{"text":"Just a few minutes from Yonge and Queen, this little place may get mistaken for something else because it's so small. 
You walk in and are faced with this huge tank of clean water and live lobsters. Beside it, they have pre boiled lobsters ready to take home. 

Their menu is simple to read and understand. You have to be hella clueless and mess it out. 
I got the grilled cheese lobster sandwich with a side of seaweed salad. Not your typical food items. The grilled cheese was full of cheese and lobster. No cheapness or portion shifted. If you're expecting the typical seaweed salad, this isn't it. It's a mix of REAL seaweed in huge bits with other greens, cucumbers and tomatoes. Quite yummy.  Unless your a total fatass, everything is pretty much under $20

The staff are really friendly and are willing to answer any questions or concerns you may have. Don't go with the group of 15 in winter expecting to get seats inside. The place only seats 10! It's a small cost little fish shack."}
{"text":"Not sure why the previous reviewers hated this place so much. Maybe they went there just when the restaurant has newly opened, with busy crowds due to good marketing scheme. This might suggest that they might fail to handle large crowds.

When I tried this place for the first time, there were barely enough people to fill the place. No long line up, no long wait. And food quality is vey good. 

The portion is just about right and price is not that high for a simple lunch with the Crispy Haddock Sandwich along with chips and slaw is about $9. Maybe 1 or 2 dollars higher than a fast food lunch, but sound about the same for a fish and chips at St Lawrence market. Not to say the experience here is a lot better, the restaurant staffs were very helpful and attentive.

The environment is fairly comfortable with a clean and interesting interior design. A lot of efforts put into packaging which I can see why it seems environmental unfriendly. If you like to treat nature well, there is always option for you to bring your own bag and box."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Under seasoned. Stale bun. This place is terrible.

Was very excited to try as I heard good things and is a part of the chase group. Although it is very nice inside the food does not meet the same standard...

Everything was bland, no flavor. Not sure what your paying for - my sandwich was 20% fish and 80% bun (which was horribly stale)

Don't waste your time or your money"}
{"text":"Okay, so i went to the outdoor market on uni&adelaide, 

Little fin had a booth there.

Aweful fish n chips. 

10 bucks for what i posted, plus 2 bucks for the eska.

Everything was frozen, then deep fried. Boy do i miss Westcoast fish n chips...

I have nothing more to say except, very disappointed..."}
{"text":"I have a general good feeling about this place, and it can be attributed to a number of things... the adorable logo, the simple interior, and of course, the food that makes you feel content in an effortless way. 

We got the haddock sandwich with seaweed salad and the tuna burger with coleslaw. Personally I thought the seaweed salad was way more interesting than the coleslaw, with its tangy taste and unique texture, which accentuated the flavour of the fish, but my partner thought it was too sesamey so we traded and were both satisfied. I would pick the haddock over the tuna as it's nicely breaded and tender in the inside, but the tuna had nice intricate flavours as well. 

One thing that I could not figure out was the take out bags, is there a valid reason for why it's so so so big?? Let's just say we had an adventure trying to get rid of it afterwards.  

WY"}
{"text":"We had fish and chips at their Adelaide eats kiosk. The food is okay nothing to brag about. However, it takes too much time even to prepare a single order. Especially when the place was not at all busy. Not a big fan of their food."}
{"text":"The people at Little Fin were kind enough to provide me with a free meal after they saw my original review. They added seats and changed their menu so I was told to drop by to check it all out. I finally returned about three months after their grand opening. 

When I got there, it was jam packed. All the seats were filled during lunch hour. Since I was unable to score a seat, I once again took my meal to McDonald's to eat.

This time, I ordered a large Lobster Poutine because people have been recommending it. When I opened my container, the poutine's aroma was amazing. I haven't smelled poutine that good before! I recommend the large for two people or if you plan to save it for later because it is a big portion for just one person. 

Overall, my feelings on Little Fin improved. From observation, I believe they cut back on their menu offerings. Though I preferred their original menu board because it suited the theme of the restaurant compared to the new one. Prices are still approximately around $10."}
{"text":"Cute lunch spot
Atmosphere was good
Lunch combos are good value.  
Had the lobster roll which was only ok.  There was not much lobster and too much dill and other filler.  The sides were excellent! Had seaweed salad and potato wedges."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am so happy I found this place.  Well for starters this is owned by the folks at the Chase so the taste and quality are what you expect from them.  In short this is a \"healthier\" fish sandwich shop. I had the special--Atlantic cod with seaweed salad and crispy potatoes for $10.  It was great and not too greasy.  I especially liked the seaweed salad.  It's winter so there are only a few high top tables--we took our meals to go."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5. I shared a lobster poutine with a friend. Lobster was okay and sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered a large Lobster Poutine to go, since the patio and inside were super busy. The wait was kind of long, but it was lunch service and they were packed. The poutine It came in a nifty, deep biodegradable container. However, the large paper bag it came in was excessive (even for the Financial District demographic). The poutine itself, was delicious. An adequate amount of lobster. The fries seemed to be seasoned in chicken boullion, which gives it that MSG taste but delicious nonetheless. You might be super thirsty afterwards though. Very flavourful and fresh. A tad pricey though."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I went to lunch at Little Fin with a TravelZoo during Christmas. I had the haddock sandwich, wedge fries and seaweed salad while my co-worker had the crab cake and seaweed salad. We were both extremely happy with our selections  and service was excellent. The only drawback was the limited seating. We were forced to have takeout as everything was already full before 12:00. But I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Friday night at 7pm I walked into Little Fin, it was not my first time here--in fact I had a bad experience which was made right by Little Fin the first time.  However, this time I walked in and there was no one in sight, not sure if it was actually open.  I waited about 10 minutes before I turned around to leave but then one of the employees came out of no where and got his 'boss'? This man in a suit took my order.  I ordered a lobster roll with just potatoes (I am not a fan of slaw nor seaweed).  

As I waited I noticed a long table for communal dining (business area quick lunch) and more seating by the windows--very cute and great idea for a small space.  It was very boat themed with baby blues and the decor. 

It was not a long wait till my order was fulfilled, service was quiet but good.  Lobster Roll and Orange juice in hand ($21) I was on my way home 

The disappointment lies in the lack of lobster in the roll (picture uploaded).  It was a tiny roll--you can imagine my disappointment when half my roll did not have lobster but a plain bun!

Two stars simply for the underwhelming food and the initial wait not knowing if the store was open or not."}
{"text":"I tried the crispy haddock sandwich and it was pretty good. You get to pick two sides to go with it. I picked the house salad which was basically coleslaw, and potato wedges. The haddock didn't taste frozen and it was battered just the right amount. They give you an extra side of the sauce they put in the burger as well which was nice. The sides were yummy, except I felt the coleslaw was a little over dressed. And the potato wedges was seasoned a little too heavily so it was kinda salty. The seasoning flavour was good though. They also offer complimentary water, so you don't have to purchase any drinks. 

The decor of the place was pretty cute. Seats quite a bit of people for such a small food place. They also have a small patio section at the front of the store. I decided to sit outside because it was too hot inside. The service was also very friendly and warm. The girl who took our order also brought our food outside to us once it was ready. 

Anyways, overall the experience was pretty average I would say. It's a good place to grab a quick lunch during a work day if in the area. But not a place I would purposely go out of the way for though."}
{"text":"Little Fin is a great place to grab a bite in the financial district. They've got a spacious front patio, and a laid back ambience for those who want to enjoy their catch on the spot. Service is speedy and enthusiastic and the menu offers plenty of variety.

Must-try items:
Crispy Haddock sandwich
House Salad
Wedges

Portions are generous here, so you'll definitely get your money's worth. The space is clean with high ceilings and stylish, modern decor. Up to 10 or more patrons can dine inside, with even more space outside. 

I enjoyed the haddock very much and will be back to try more in the near future. Although it doesn't grow in the sea, the fried chicken sandwich sounds like another good choice for a meal. Don't be fooled by the ratings, it's worth taking the plunge, so dive right in."}
{"text":"This is one of the better fast food lunch place- really cute seafood restaurant that pays attention to every little detail. It's a little bit pricier than food court lunch spots but I think its worth it. I always order the ahi tuna soba noodle salad and fries. Their fries are sooooooo good. Ahi soba noodle salad is thebomb.com and it's always hard for me to try something new from their menu because I love it so much!"}
{"text":"One of may favourite lunch spots in the financial district.  They make the best Crispy Chicken BLT, and their other fish sandwiches are great as well.  Recommend you get their earlier as they do tend to sell out around 1pm."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner with a friend on a whim, and because I am a seafood lover. Little Fin is a small and cute restaurant, and I like that it is located close to the financial district. The food is a bit pricier even than most place downtown, but then again for a seafood establishment it is not all that bad. I ordered the surf 'n turf fin burger ($12) and shared a small lobster poutine ($12) with my friend. All of their burgers and sandwiches come with a side of crispy potato wedges and slaw or seaweed salad. I got the seaweed salad with mine and it was really, really good! Don't know how to compares with the slaw, but I would get the seaweed again - it is different from the kind of thin, strands of seaweed salad you get at sushi places or at the Asian supermarket. Instead, it's like chunks/leaves of seaweed, and comes with a very refreshing dressing and some crunchy bits. Honestly this was probably the highlight of my meal HAHA which is kind of sad when you think about it. The burger wasn't too bad, it was pretty flavourful and I enjoyed it, but it's hard to really taste fish in it - I think next time I will try one of their fish sandwiches instead. The lobster poutine is a pretty substantial portion I think, so I would definitely recommend sharing this so you can try other things from the menu. It was okay, had a decent amount of lobster chunks and wasn't too salty, but I thought the cheese wasn't melty enough and overall I wasn't super blown away by this, but it's not bad. I think I would come again to try other items!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a colleague and ordered the fish and chips. 'Crispy haddock and chips' as they call it. 
It isn't your traditional battered fish as it seemed to have this really thin breading rather than a batter - like the 'healthy alternative'. The chips were okay - a little dry on the inside. They served it with coleslaw, just two packets or ketchup, no lemon and no malt vinegar. They do have some sort of a mayo based dipping sauce but I would have certainly preferred just the traditional tartar sauce. 
I'm giving it 3 stars because it's just okay. If you want great fish and chips done the traditional way, go to frescos in Kensington. It's quite a trek but worth it. 
Won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"It has so much potential and by reading previous reviews it seems this was once a great spot for lobster rolls. I tried the cute little lobster roll and was so underwhelmed. It's so tiny. They should probably serve it in smaller containers to make it seem more substantial. Flavours were there... the seaweed salad was good... My friend had the fish and chips and he wasn't impressed either. It was coated in what looked like breadcrumbs and then fried? No option of tartar sauce  The price is faaaar too steep for the mediocrity. Meh, I won't be back"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place when I saw that it was on the ubereats app. I ordered the ultimate bre-fin sandwich  and it is described as piled high with peameal bacon, egg and hashbrowns. I ordered mine in the morning but didn't get a chance to eat it right away and was lazy to heat it up but let me tell you it still tasted amazing. All the flavours just worked and was topped off with lettuce and tarter sauce. At the end of it I wish I had another one. I would definitely order this sandwich again and maybe give the other items they have a try next time."}
{"text":"Little Fin... what happened to you? I used to be such a fan but you have gone downhill so quickly, I've hardly blinked! My usual order at Little Fin was the lobster roll with the seaweed salad and potato wedges. Everything was so good. Then today, I ordered my usual, and was appalled that the portion has almost been reduced by half! For reference, I've posted a picture of before and after comparison. First of all, the lobster roll itself is now pathetically tiny. Even the potato wedges and seaweed salad portions are noticeably smaller. If you're going to make the lobster roll smaller, at least give me more sides! Anyway, my whole box just looks incredibly sad, and I couldn't believe I paid $16 for this. They even further cheaped out by getting rid of the wet napkins... 

To confirm that it was not a one-time issue, I checked with my boyfriend, who orders Little Fin quite often for dinner. He also noticed that the portions were vastly reduced suddenly one week. It was quite a disappointment and it will take a lot to persuade me to go back to Little Fin after this experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was not able to taste their food, so I can't give more stars. Although I really wanted to try their seafood. I walked in Little Fin at 11:40am when they supposed to be open to order something to eat, the music was cranked up pretty heavy. The girl at the cashier saw me right away and turned back to an iPad she was working on. I know what I wanted right away so I was just waiting until she turns back to me. I wasn't able to say anything to her because it was way too loud, pretty much up to a club standards. She turned around after a while, noted with her head  and turned back. I stand for another several minutes and lost my patience."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. Had the house special turkey sandwich and spent most of my one pulling out globs of fat from my sandwich. Also, is it necessary to provide every sandwich with a bag that's durable enough to be used as a camping bag? Especially with no recycling available."}
{"text":"I have had food from Little fin a few times.  Its really fresh and fllavourful.  On my last visit i had the chicken ndwich ith potato wedges and coleslaw.  The potatoes can  be. A bit salty with the asoning on it but its great if you like your potatoes seasoned.  The chicken was good t the sandwich got soggy quickly"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out, but had to wait about 20 minutes to eat. By then the fries were fairly soggy and the sandwiches were cold, but still very tasty! Would definitely recommend eating the sammies as fresh as possible :) The cole slaw, the Fried Chicken BLT & the Fancy sauce were all super delicious!"}
{"text":"Used to be a huge fan of Little Fin and would visit on the occasional month for lunch. I loved their calamari po boy, but recently they had a menu change and took it off. They now serve tacos, if you're into those! Since they didn't have the po boy, I ordered their crispy haddock sandwich. My fiancé used to order that alot over the summer and it was quite yummy with a thick piece of haddock sticking out of the bun. To my surprise, the haddock piece is now alot smaller and thinner. We used to make our way downtown, a 30 minute drive from where we are for lunch here. Not sure if we'll be returning anymore, or as frequent. Maybe if they start changing back to their old ways. Portion sizes are small..  But sides still taste the same. (thank goodness!)"}
{"text":"I had an intense craving for fish and chips so decided to go check out Little Fin, which is right next to The Chase. It's a small shop with a clean interior and friendly staff. The menu has some standard items like fish sandwiches, lobster rolls and tacos plus some more inventive dishes like their soba noodle salad which sounds delicious (yes, salads can be delicious). 

I decided to keep things simple and got their signature haddock with chips. It wasn't cheap but the dish came with two large pieces of fish so I can't really complain. The fish was well cooked and fresh but I was really surprised by the heavy breading surrounding it, unlike the usual light batter. Although it was good, it wasn't great. My favourite spot for fish and chips is still The One That Got Away on King West but the portion was worth it and I really enjoyed the wedges which were very well seasoned. As someone who isn't a fan of coleslaw I enjoyed that addition as well, which was nice and light side. I wish the meal came with a lemon wedge though. 

Would come back to try their other items, just not the fish and chips again."}
