{"text":"Amazing quality (way better than grocery store) and amazing personalized service. Highly recommend Calgary Meats."}
{"text":"I went to Calgary meats to get soup bones for my big dog. I mentioned that I have two tiny chihuahuas that I can't find bones for as they are so small. The staff was kind enough to cut down a large bone into 8 small pieces which my dogs are able to handle and thoroughly enjoyed.

The shop has a very good variety of items and some exclusive meat sticks and/or jerkies. I will definitely return and do recommend them for their service."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service and great value. I was able to get local products and in house made processed meats (sausage, jerky) without any garbage ingredients. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"No preservatives, hormone free, natural goodness. Don't get the turkey jerky, I want it all to myself.

Meat is pricier than in a generic grocery store, but it is worth it, you can taste the difference.

The employees are very knowledgeable and will give you tons of information about the meat if you ask."}
{"text":"I've been going to this little deli for almost 20 years. It's still as great as it was the first time I stepped through the door.

Yes, the smell of smoked meat envelopes you when you walk in. But to me, it's heavenly. Seriously, who doesn't love that smell? It's like saying you don't like bacon. We all know bacon makes everything better. And this place does have bacon, although I've never bought any here. What I have bought and consider the best on the planet, is their homemade beef jerky. Whatever kind of seasoning they use just makes my mouth water. If you can snag some made fresh that day, it's absolutely incredible. I now drive all across town just for some jerky. They make a number of varieties including turkey, beef, and buffalo. All so tasty!

I'd often stop in to grab a chicken (or veal) cordon blue to make for supper. They are ready to just pop in the oven and cook. And oh are they good! Tender chicken with a good helping of cheese and ham inside. I've served these to guests and everyone agreed they were like homemade, which they are, just not by me. I've tried their bison steaks, sausage, and a number of other meat choices. Their homemade perogies are almost as good as Grandma makes. Everything here was top quality. 

Over the years, Calgary Meats and Deli have expanded the selection of items they sell to include a variety of meats (including wild meat) and fish, perogies, deli meats, and a whole bunch of sauces and condiments. The staff here is always so friendly. Since I've been a customer here for so long, I have dealt with the parents who own the store and both their son & daughter. Everyone is so nice and helpful. If there's something you don't see out front, they will go to the back and slice you up whatever it is you want. They will get you whatever cut of meat you're looking for and trust me, it'll be good. I can honestly that I've never had a bad experience here and for that, I hope to keep returning for another 20 years."}
{"text":"Had a very good quality new yorks and a t-bone. The price was more than reasonable and way lower than in the stores."}
{"text":"When you enter this deli all you can smell is fresh smoked meat, it reminds me of the smokehouses in Old Crow, Yukon where you enter and all you smell is fresh caribou meat.

This place is really clean, has nice visuals and the gal working there is really friendly.  The counter showcase displays all the nice cuts from bison to beef, pork and elk.  The standup freezer carries the duck and poultry products.

The cuts look lean and nice and red plus the prices seem really reasonable.

If you are on Edmonton Trail this is an easy turn for meating!"}
{"text":"Great meat shop. Fantastic service. Very knowledgeable staff. Great selection of meats."}
