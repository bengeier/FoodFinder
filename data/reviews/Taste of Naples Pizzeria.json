{"text":"I have been eating pizza all my life...it is safe to say this one of the best places for pizza and calzone. Gerry (the Pizzialo) has a true passion for the food and traditions of his culture."}
{"text":"We decided to try this pizza place and we were glad we did. The pizza was excellent. This really isn't a full restaurant but rather a take out place with 3 tables for those that want to eat and run. Aside from that, we each ordered a 12\" 3 topping pizza. Each of our pizza's tasted very fresh and made with high quality ingredients. The pizza crust was a bit like a sweeter multi-grain dough vs a traditional white dough. It was perfect and we found ourselves enjoying every square inch of it. Pizzas were fresh out of the oven hot, more of a traditional thin crust and in no way heavy or over loaded. Each ingredient was identifiable and nothing over powered.   The restaurant itself was clean, well cared for and comfortable. There is evidence of ownership pride. There is rest room available too if you are dining on site.   For the 3 of us, 3 pizzas, 3 beverages for $38 all in was worth it.   It was a pleasant and surprisingly good lunch experience."}
{"text":"This is a REAL pizza slice!!  Difficult to find a good slice of pizza like this in Toronto.  If you're around Vaughn Mills shopping stop by and give it try.  Great Authentic Authentic thin crust pizza with focus on sourcing quality ingredients. The pizza here is really Amazing!!  Crust is crispy yet had a bit of chewiness to it.   Don't settle for a cheaper $ and lower quality slice elsewhere.  Try this place.  There's a difference!  Will be coming by every time I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza.  I was driving by with my family after finishing dinner at a local restaurant and had to stop. Being a pizza aficionado, even on a full stomach, how could I pass up at taste of Napoli.   I ordered the margarita to get a good base on the pizza:  The crust was amazing, very light and airy with a slight chew on the inside and crunchy on the outside, a hint of sweetness and a slight nutty taste.  The sauce was very good, the tomatoes (San Marzano) basil, oregano, garlic and olive oil really came through. Well balanced, nothing over powering. Just the right amount of mozzarella and parmigiana. Overall, a great pizza   We will be returning soon, this time on empty stomachs to try pizzas with different toppings. This pizzeria is definitely worth driving to. To top it off, the pizzaiolo is very friendly."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp, and Gerry the owner would like to thank you all too! We found this gem via yelp and decided to give it a shot. The only downside is the location is kinda off the beaten path (located at back of the plaza opposite the town houses) Gerry the ex rocker makes one mean pizza with his own secret dough and sauce that is a combination of homemade and a nice gourmet pizza joint. The crust is light and airy and the sauce is good with hints of basil and oregano, I imagine the panzerotti's are going to be amazing. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great owner, so passionate about his pizza, one of the tastiest pizza joints in vaughan. Ingredients are fresh and the crust is to die for...highly recommended and definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Gerry has it going on. I love love the crust, it has great texture... the sauce is amazing as well. I prefer the basic Margarita over anything else..."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Opened up a couple months ago. Owner seems passionate about his pizza. Secret recipe that has been handed down from the family. Sauce and dough are made in house. Toppings taste fresh. Definitely great pizza and would try again."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is a real gem.  First time here and had the panzerotti.  Easily the best I've ever had.  My son and I kept talking about how good it was on the drive home!  Phenomenal experience.  Can't wait to return to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Gerry is a kind hearted owner that makes each pie with diligence, caring and love.  I think his family recipe sauce is the best around and his home made crust is just the right combination of crusty, chew and texture, has a hint of nuttiness from the flax meal...just perfect.  Tucked in away from the main road, his recipes and his execution is outstanding.  You'll be taking away your food, but, if you're like us, won't get far.  We enjoyed it so much that we finished his pizzas in the parking lot.  Not to be confused with the so many other options that are out there, Gerry serves up the real deal, not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vaughan. In an area where there are pizza places surrounding us, this one is the best in authenticity, quality and taste. Very kind owner, you can tel this is what he loves to do and that passion is infused in his art of making a great pizza. It was our first visit but definitely not our last. Bravissimo!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Woodbridge...finally! My family and I have been on a mission to discover great pizza in Woodbridge and I am glad to say that our search is over.  It is obvious the owner is very passionate about his pizza. He has surpassed all of our must haves:  taste, quality, authenticity, and price."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Worth trying out. The owner, Gerry, is a multi-talented guy. He is a singer-songwriter who is more than willing to entertain you while you wait for your pizza. In fact, he has his guitar on the premises. I believe that he has the potential to make the big time someday."}
{"text":"They are not kidding... Best pizza ever. Delicious crust, good sauce, and awesome friendly place. Definitely worth it"}
{"text":"This pizza is mouth watering. My waistline just exploded. I ate this 3 times this week. I will be a forever customer. I already cant wait until it opens so I can put in another order ."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  My colleague and I were in the area and found this place on Yelp.  The pizza was fantastic.  The flax seed dough was amazing and for once, my pizza was not dripping with grease or too salty.  The price was perfect and I'd recommend this place over any of the other chains.  A plus was that the chef plays guitar as well.  He busted out an acoustic and started playing for us.  A very good lunch we had."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing. We stumbled upon this gem of a place while in the area and decided to try it based on the reviews.   The sauce, crust and toppings are delicious and Gerry the owner has a passion for pizza! We tried the 3 topping special on our first visit and it was one of the best we've ever tried.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Another delicious addition to the woodbridge pizza scene. Tasty, not too heavy, just enough crispy and great take out option for an evening or weekend with friends and family. Plus the owner Gerry is an awesome guy. makes you feel welcome. We go pretty regularly."}
{"text":"We found this little out of the way place through Yelp. And what a find it was. Excellent pizza, especially the crust. It was so good we got a second to go. The owner was great and very helpful (as we have a severe nut allergy). Only downside was that it has only three tables to eat in. But absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The best pizza we had so far in Canada! On top, we experienced a warm and welcoming service. Every penny spent is worth it."}
{"text":"Signed up for yelp just to rate, amazing service, best I've ever had. Pizza was 10/10 as well, even better at the price! I had the 3 topping 12\" pizza w pop for 12$! Would definitely love to come again."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place other than the pizza is simply amazing! It's family owned and the service is top notched which makes you feel welcomed.  This pizzeria is more of a take out place but does promote their $2 Margherita slice of pizza to quick take out guests.  The only negative I have about this place is that they should have definitely marketed more because they deserve more foot traffic!  Now on to the pizza, it has a different textured pizza dough that you're used to that gives it a different feel to it.  We got the $20 16\" pizza that came with 5 toppings.  Topped it off with bacon, ham, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and pineapple.  One advice if you were to order a pizza here during rush hour times would be to just call in advanced with a set time expectancy to allow them to cook it fresh! Definitely worth the wait and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow ! Colour me impressed ! Perhaps one of the best pizzas I have ever had...and my waistline will enforce the fact that I've eaten a lot of pizza in my day....  The restaurant itself is in a plaza at Rutherford Rd and Vellore Woods Blvd, in the plaza on the right side if you're going north on Vellore Woods Blvd. In this same plaza are 2 other pizza parlours, both of which have their niche market, but both of which should be nervous about this new entry into the plaza.  We popped in last night and ordered 3 personal sized pizzas (which are on sale for $10/each). We chatted with the owner as he \"stretched\" the dough onto a pizza ring, then added home made pizza sauce, Saputo Gold Mozzarella and our choices of fresh toppings, all the while discussing his passion for food. He then popped them into the oven and they were out in 10 minutes. The smells were intoxicating and we couldn't wait to get them home to taste them  Ordered were: Pizza 1 - cheese, ham, mushrooms and pineapple Pizza 2 - cheese, bacon, hot peppers (jalapenos), onion Pizza 3 - cheese, bacon, hot peppers, sun dried tomatoes  I have to tell you....these pizzas were unbelievable. The were light, flavourful, cooked to perfection with amazing sauce and crust. The owner obviously knows his stuff and it shows in the final product.   The restaurant itself is small and is more of a take out place. There are a few table and chairs but its more of a to-go kind of place. A home-made lamp is outside the door, proudly painted in the colours of the Italian flag (ask about its origin) with a Brio bottle as a light bulb (which unfortunately, doesn't light up)  The only negative I have about the place is that its not in an ideal location and may get overlooked or not \"discovered\" by area/local residents.  That would be a huge shame as the pizzas are fantastic and the restaurant is a huge addition to the neighbourhood.   I'm drooling just thinking about going back......"}
{"text":"Just got a 5 toppings 16 inch pizza to share with my husband. Loved it. Mushrooms/sundried tomatoes/onions/pepperoni/bacon. YUM! love the crust. Reminds us of Italy. The owner was friendly. Even sang for us. Would come back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars not for perfection but because I have nothing to complain about.  The owner is a great guy. He is curious how you found the place as at this time it is a lot of word of mouth. Nice backstory on how he got to where he is.  Now for the Pizza! when you hold the slice, it isn't a piece of cardboard like many places.   This has to be a first for me. The dough is what i noticed 1st when I had my first bite. The was light, chewy. it was cooked just right. Cheese tasted good and not over bearing like pizza should. (If that is an issue for you go to PIzza Hut)  The toppings? I can see Pepperoni and all the other toppings I ordered and he did not skimp. Everything was fresh and good. This was an issue I had in a previous review for a Panago location. I ate the crust! I rarely eat pizza crust and the crust was gooood.  Now this is what really surprised me. I ordered the 16\" 5 topping special for $20. For the size and quality of the food I consider it a bargin.  He loves what he is doing and you can taste it in his food. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza is unreal. Homemade dough, sauce, and fresh toppings can't be beat especially when it's being prepared by someone from the homeland. If you go to any other pizza joint in that plaza you either have no brains or no taste buds."}
