{"text":"I ate here the first day they opened.  They must have had 10 people working but the service was not the best.  They clearly did not prepare well for a grand opening.  It's like they were training people on the fly.  Hello- you need to do this BEFORE your first customer walks in the door!  Food is also so mediocre and so bland that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was great! I had the brisket burrito it was much better than chipotle... I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic. Everything is fresh, full of flavour and served within a fair amount of time. The menu selection is broad and the ladies who work here are super friendly and helpful. Definitely some of the best Mexican I've ever had. All for an excellent price! I highly recommend the carne asada tacos and seasoned rice. There is no doubt that I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"We visited Mi Taco Taqueria on three occasions and had a great experience each time. The tacos are scrumptious and there are many toppings to choose from. I ordered the: 'carne asada', 'tinga de pollo' and 'brisket', one of each. They tasted great with their own unique flavors. My favorite is the 'tinga de pollo' (chicken). We also got a side of tasty guacamole with chips; Mexican street toasted corn, which was super delish as well as rice, and beans that accompanied the food nicely.   What I love about Mi Taco is the fact that you can customize your order with any toppings and sauces to your liking. They also have a variety of other dishes such as burritos and burrito bowls.   On our second visit we met the owner who really appreciates her customers and ensures that the flavors reflect that. And she can make a mean margarita, too. Two thumbs up for that one. It's hard to find a decent restaurant that makes, bakes and serves real authentic cuisine with margaritas and beer.  The dine-in experience of Mi Taco Taqueria is unassuming, unpretentious and very welcoming. The staff is friendly and prepares all food in house including the baked tortillas. A great little local joint to grab a bite, sit down with friends or even go for a quick fun date with your loved one. We recommend Mi Taco Taqueria!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch based on the decent reviews and was very disappointed. When I first entered there was a bit of a line but I decided to stick it out as I had about 40 minutes before I had to be back at work. While waiting in line I could see a lot of customers that seemed to have been waiting for some time, many of which I could hear were receiving incorrect orders, or hadn't received their orders (and subsequently Mi Taco had lost the persons order all together). Still, I stuck it out as I was anxious to try their brisket bowl. I waited 40 minutes, for them to literally place heated up brisket onto the grill, and scoop ingredients into a container.This should not have taken 40 minutes and the food was less than impressive. The brisket lacked flavour and the entire bowl was just meh. Will not be trying this place again. LEARN TO MANAGE A LUNCH CROWD, please.  Tip: Don't go here if you don't have a full lunch hour, you will be late"}
{"text":"Really disappointing tacos. The food is tasteless and overpriced. The tacos were small and presentation limp. Toronto deserves better."}
{"text":"I arrived just after 1:15 to grab lunch before heading back to the office. The cashier explained how to order and what each meal contained. Since I was heading back to work and wanted something less messy, I went for the Tinga de Pollo bowl, minus the beans. Everything in my bowl was great, except the rice. The rice was undercooked: every bite contained hard pieces of rice. I ended up eating the toppings and throwing the rice away. I want to give it at least 3 stars, but that rice was just terrible."}
{"text":"Tacos were good, but they completely forgot about my order and after telling them of the mistake took me another 10 minutes to get my food. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing food (finger-licking marinade!), high quality ingredients (spoke to the server about their choice of sustainable and carefully selected seafood), and even better customer service (everyone was so friendly)... All in all the perfect recipe for an amazing taco experience!"}
{"text":"I just had a steak burrito. The tortilla was the best I've ever had. Flavours were incredible... the pico was perfect. I am not exaggerating, I've eaten a lot of Mexican and tex mex and this was the best. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad. I stopped in for lunch and ordered a bowl. I didn't care for the oversized take-out container it was served in. It was just too big - and it made the portion look really small. It also made it hard to actually approach the food as the flap sort of sticks out into your chest as you're trying to get close. Having said that, I thought it tasted fine. It could have been a bit bigger (I am eating small portions these days and I expected to have leftovers but I didn't). Also as a tip, they do serve tap water in a cup, just ask for it. I didn't know that so I bought a bottle of water."}
{"text":"I haven't made a review in a while but I had to come back to give Mi Taco their well deserved five stars! I got the brisket burrito, which is one of my favs next to halibut. It definitely hit the spot! The brisket was super moist and flavorful and the other toppings (cilantro, lettuce, onions, etc) complimented the meat well. The only thing I would do differently is add beans and maybe some guac."}
{"text":"After returning from Mexico City, we were craving some real tacos, and Mi Taco didn't disappoint!  First off: what amazing staff! We met Greg, the owner, while he was handing out samples outside. He made us feel really welcome, as did the lovely servers. We haven't seen such happy workers in a Toronto restaurant for a long time.  Greg and his wife are running a very Mexican taquería. From the delectable chicken tinga to the crispy fish tacos to the perfect guacamole to the fresh flour tortillas, everything actually tasted better than it did in Mexico City. And there were actual Latinos eating there-- and they were delighted to see the imported Mexican sweets and sodas on sale, as well.  The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, the location is perfect, and the food is wonderful. All in all, a great find. Thanks Greg-- wishing you success for a much-needed family-run business on Queen West!"}
{"text":"I moved to Canada from San Diego CA, the homeland of Mexican food in American, and  I never thought I'd be able to have real Mexican food again without traveling 3.000 miles... that is until our dinner at Mi Taco Taqueria!  The flavours are very authentic, and delicious.  The staff is so friendly and helpful that it felt like we were regular customers not a first timers.  Our group had fish, carne asada, brisket and chicken tacos, a carne asada burrito bowl and a carne asada burrito.  You can tell that the tortillas are homemade, and the all the ingredients are fresh.   They also sell several types of hot sauce, I almost cried when I saw my beloved Tapatio!!  Our teenage nephew is the MOST picky eater I have ever seen, he only eats about three things, we made him try the brisket tacos and he fell in love!  If Mi Taco can sway that kid, the power of their food strong!  We are often in TO, and will be there next for FanExpo - I see me eating there every single day!!!  p.s.  Mmmmmm, those beans!!"}
{"text":"It's fine if you have no other option around. But this place was a huge let down. Had the veg-bowl and while the ingredients were fresh, there was absolutely no flavor, nothing that felt Mexican, or not memorable at all. The salsas were average. The bottled sauces were scarce in variety and the ones that were provided were not re-filled appropriately. The hosts were helpful during ordering but felt it became a bit disorganized during service where it took a while to figure out which tables got what food. Queen street is filled with great finds. I would rather skip this one for another if the food quality doesn't improve. Sorry"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken burrito and frozen lime margarita and it was amazing. Cute little joint in downtown. Staff is very friendly and the environment is open and fun. This needs to be brought to America asap."}
{"text":"Mi Taco es...bah, you know.  Loved the multi-variety bottles of hot sauce available at the counter.  Liked the friendly service that recommended shrimp tacos over the fish tacos when there was no fish available for the day.  Mediocre-ly enjoyed the Mexican Street Corn, which basically seemed like frozen corn kernels with a bit of white crumbly cheese/queso on top at a rather costly $3.  The tacos themselves were small and rather bland, with the saving grace of the aforementioned readily-available hot sauce.   On a side note, I have a feeling this retail spot is cursed.  It seems like restaurants that set up shop here rarely survive past the one-year mark....and sadly, I'm pretty sure Mi Taco is headed the same way without many distinctive features to remember it by."}
{"text":"I am assuming this place is fairly new. My friend and I were in the city and we were super hungry. We really enjoy mexican food and we missed Chipotle! HAHA! I know we're so american. Anyways, we decided to try this place. I got a burrito. You can see them making the actual tortilla right in front. It's pretty neat. The employees here are super nice! The burritos are pretty big and they are not picky with their portions. I've never had rice all mashed together, but man... it was delicious! You can choose your meats and they also have vegetarian choices! Don't worry! And choose your toppings that you want in your burrito, taco, or bowl. It can get a little pricey, but I thought it was fairly reasonable. Very filling and it was big in portion size. It's a very small place and not many seatings/tables. By the way they also have free wifi! YAY! just ask the cashier for the password and they will give it to you!"}
{"text":"Toronto food scene is lacking. It's nice taco shells that they make but the tacos were whatever.  Not authentic by any means"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and they have $5 margaritas. I will def come back. I love how amazing and fresh the tacos were. We had chicken tacos with chipotle sauce on top and guacamole. It was just delicious."}
{"text":"They offer good quality, fresh Mexican food. Now that we have established that, here are my other thoughts:  1. I had never had to \"wait\" for Mexican food for 10-15 minutes before.  2. I can't tell if this place is high-end or low-end. They need to either lower their prices or increase the quality of the interior such as cleanness.  3. I cant imagine anyone enjoying eating here much, it would make more sense to have take away."}
{"text":"Good! Fresh food. Tortilla is really unique tasting. Absolutely no gummy store bought quality to it at all."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are amazing. Very flavourful and fresh. The handmade flour tortillas compliment the tacos very well. Can't leave without grabbing a cup of the Mexican corn!"}
{"text":"Tasty tacos with freshly made flour tortillas, but minuscule portions. The Taco Plato comes with two mini-CD sized tortillas, a mini scoop of meat, toppings that overwhelm the filling, sand two large tubs of tasteless smashed beans and room-temperature Mexican rice in an attempt to compensate for the sad little tacos. That with a Mexican Coca Cola, all for just over $14 (with tax).  Not worth it."}
{"text":"The service and ambience of the place is good but the food is average. I ordered a vegetable burrito and the tortilla wasn't cooked properly and taste was just ok."}
{"text":"GREAT Place! I had my birthday celebration here and it was by no means less than great.  The food was delicious and fresh.  We were about a group of 16.  Everyone enjoyed the food.   The owners were great and know how to make great Tex Mex food.  I used to live in Dallas, TX and I know good Tex Mex food when I taste it.  I would highly recommend this restaurant based on its great quality of food for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was walking along Queen St West after running errands and decided to pick up some food to go. I was in a bit of a rush and decided on tacos. Mi Taco Taqueria was funky, looked like a good deal. I walked in. There were 2 people ahead of me in line. I ordered 2 Taco Platos. One for myself and one for my s/o. I ordered one fish each, a brisket and a carne asada, the taco plato came with a side of mashed beans and rice. I was told when I ordered the fish that it takes 3-4 minutes to make. I also ordered a side of guac and a mandarin soda.  I waited about 10 minutes for them to call me to dress my tacos. There was a bit of a rush when it was my turn to have my tacos dressed. There were about 4 employees working. I found that it was a bit disorganized and therefore everything took way longer than it should have... People even left because it took too long to prepare the fish. I finally got my order, took an uber home and had my meal. I would say that having tacos as take out is messy - but not this messy! They should definitely invest in some taco friendly take-out boxes (I've seen them before in other taco/burrito places).   Needless to say - tacos weren't that great, neither was the mashed beans and rice. The employees seemed a bit flustered - one girl working the line was super nice though. They take the casual approach which sometimes may come off as too casual and unprofessional. I did get a bit of an 'upset stomach' after eating here.   TLDR; do not recommend. Mediocre food at best for such a cutely decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Mi Taco Taqueria.  Came here around 1 PM. Only one table of people to be seen, so lots of space to take pictures. The seating area at the back can sit maybe 20 people, with some tables, benches, and stools around the counter.  Order up at the front, grab a number, and find a seat. Free water is available along with re-usable cups. Not sure how clean the cups are though.  Tacos cost 3.75 each, add 50 cents for the fish/shrimp option. I decided to go with the Taco Plato for 9.95 because it came with two tacos along with a side of rice and beans. For the first taco I got Carne Asada (beef) and the second was Grilled Pescado.  After a few minutes, one of the staff took a tray of food to another table and asked them if it was theirs, but they said no. Then came to me and asked if I ordered it, and it was my order. I asked if it was for the number I received, and the person ran back to the counter to check. Numbers are a good idea, but I think they should just announce the number and wait for acknowledgement; much more organized that way.  The tacos came with pretty generous amounts of proteins. Despite the size of the tortilla itself, they didn't skimp on the meat. The beef taco came with a dozen cubes of beef, and the fish taco came with a nice slice of fish. Also came with lots of toppings to fill up the taco, though for some reason the fish taco came in a mountain but the beef taco was a bit flatter.  Rice and Beans were alright. I liked the rice, but the beans were a bit too salty. There's a bottle of hot sauce on the tables and it was ok in terms of spice level.  It was an alright meal; tacos were pretty filling despite the size. You could pick the tacos up with chopsticks comfortably without getting your hands dirty."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef brisket burrito and paid $0.50 extra for guacamole. I usually get whole wheat tortilla but was convinced by the cashier to try their in-house made flour tortilla instead and ehh, it was only standard.   I chose the beef brisket filling because it looked the juiciest/most tender but it was still a bit tough. It was also drenched in fluid so it made the wrap really soggy and gross to hold. The wrapping job was done poorly and the filling was leaking out everywhere.   For a little over $11 after tax, it's only ok. It was filling but so are burritos from everywhere else. With all of the choices downtown, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, really authentic Tex-Mex! Loved the brisquette, picadilo, and chicken tinga. So hard to choose between the two! The flour tortillas are freshly made in the window so food here is always fresh. Super friendly and fun staff!!"}
{"text":"On my first visit, I had the brisket burrito which I didn't find too flavorful, it was okay. But I didn't write a review because I figured they were new, I'd give them another chance later on. So the other day I went in and it was definitely better. This place has the potential to be very good, but it's the small details that they have to work on.   On my first visit, customer service was excellent, ordering and ring through were efficient. My most recent visit, the guy was soooooo slow, talked slow, moved slow, it felt like the order in front of us took forever, but to give him some credit he was super nice.   This time I had the steak tacos which were actually quite delicious, except for the fact that the cilantro was not washed properly so I was eating sand in every bite. I've done it myself when cooking at home so I did continue eating it, but my expectation is that they can prep food better than me.   While we were waiting to order, the people in front of us were trying to decide what to get and the guy was about to give them brisket when they commented on how dry it looked, and later a guy poured some water or broth or something on it. I understand that brisket is not something that gets made right away like the steak, but makes me wonder how long it had been sitting there and how old it was.  The street corn tasted good, but it felt like it was missing some sort of bold taste or something... good but if they added that one missing thing out would be spectacular.  I won't give up on this place, prices are reasonable so I will definitely give it another chance."}
{"text":"Service was really good... nice little quick serve location.  But my carnitas was a bit on the bland side.  When I think Mexican, I drool over big bold flavours.  This was anything but.. if I could describe it.. I'd say this was as vanilla a taco as you could get.  If you don't like spicy food, or have been hiding under a rock and have never tried Mexican before and worried flavour in general, then this could be a start?  Unfortunately, there isn't a great Mexican place anywhere nearby."}
{"text":"Got a fish burrito. Fish was hard and the burrito was flavorless. Just go to grand electric for good tacos instead"}
{"text":"Stopped in given the decent Yelp ratings. Maybe my expectations were too high but left a little disappointed. The location is small but several tables to sit at. You order at the counter, take a number and they will bring it out to you. My husband got 3 tacos with rice and beans - Honestly I felt the meats lacked flavor and just overall fell very flat. I had a grilled fish bowl with base being their Mexican rice and beans. The grilled fish was cooked well and did have some decent seasoning but the rice and beans literally tasted flavorless bringing the entire dish down. Their hot salsa was maybe mild-medium in my opinion but they did offer some store bought hot sauce options for those that like it a bit spicier. I had the chipotle crema that was included on my bowl which tasted like minimally flavored sour cream. The bowl really just needed more. The price of almost $36 for the 2 of us including non-alcoholic drinks seemed steep for the food we received. They do take Credit.   Staff was friendly but food was overall flavorless, pricey and we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends for their street corn. I absolutely love it and highly recommend but I'm hoping to try their other menu items.   The only issue I have with this place is that their bathrooms are not clean whatsoever. There's a strong smell of onion and bugs in their bathrooms. Their multiple toilet paper/paper towel dispensers weren't even filled. The only toilet paper they had was out in the open and all yellow.  Regardless, their street corn is still very good. But the cleanliness has me giving it a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Great burrito bowl! The extra brisket was good but tiny. Would def come again   The music is 13/10"}
{"text":"Went to Mi Taco for a quick lunch today as being from Texas, I was curious how a Canadian taco shop would taste. I was very impressed with the food quality and freshness. The meats are freshly grilled and the rice and beans taste homemade and very authentically TexMex! But the best part is the piping hot fresh of the press homemade tortillas! My son and I determined that they are as good as our favorite local Dallas spot. I also love the personal attention from the owner (female) and the cozy intimate dining room in the back. Very cool vibe. They could lose the Mexican music and play Indie but for the food and ambience, I rate it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with.   They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand?   I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level.   My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one.   I did enjoy the spread of hot sauces available to use on top of your ordered spice level."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Mi Taco (pause for laughter).  Their shrimp tacos were heavenly and much like every other fast food burrito / taco place in Toronto, you could choose your toppings - custom bowls for everyone! But sadly, things have changed.  You can now only order off of a menu of pre-arranged items - if you don't want something you have to go through the add this / take away this / are there any other options for this? process. It was so much easier when my choices were beautifully & freshly laid out in front of me. Gone are your rice options, and the bright green lettuce is now replaced with brown shrively pieces of what I am assuming was once leaves. It's a pain to look through my order to ensure that substitutions are there and items aren't missing - this may seem picky, but having the ability to make a custom bowl or taco was what I loved about this - and all burrito - places.  Next time I'll skip my once beloved Mi Taco, and instead take the extra 20 steps to Mucho Burrito where my options are a-plenty."}
{"text":"I cant say anything bad about this place. I stopped by Mi Taco by chance to grab dinner on a Thursday night and jackpot- very tasty, delicious and creative. It is filling and affordable. Nice selection of different flavours. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best elote (Mexican street corn) ever!!!! Great tacos and quite a variety. Will definitely come back soon for more :)"}
{"text":"I would say more of 3.5. The tacos are fantastic but super tiny. They try and make up for it by stuffing them so full you can't even pick them up to eat them. This of course causes a giant mess. But they are delicious. I would suggest a taco bowl over the tacos. Due to mess. Plus the price Doesn't match the size. If they are going to charge as much as they do they need to change the tortilla Size.   The corn is the best thing on the menu. Seriously so addicting. Plus the atmosphere is really cute inside and a great chill place to sit with ppl and relax.   Overall it's the better Mexican option if you are looking for something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place !  I'm a big fan of the restaurants and shops around this neighborhood. I think this taco place is one of the best ones :) They have actual hot sauce and the staff are super friendly! I usually get the chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans. It's not too expensive and the tacos are decently sized. You can also have some water while you wait, pretty nice that they add lime/lemon to it as well :)  I recommend coming here for a quick bite, it is a smaller place, but well worth a visit."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping down Queen Street West, I couldn't resist myself from buying some tacos after I stumbled upon Mi Taco. I've tried most taco restaurants around the downtown area, so I was surprised to find one that I've never heard of before.   I loved the ambience of the restaurant - it was not too loud or crowded, there were many seats and tables for you to comfortably dine in, and the workers were all really nice. I felt like I actually had room to breathe in comparison to popular places such as Seven Lives, Wilbur, or La Carnita.   In terms of food, I had the Chicken Tinga and Brisket tacos, which both tasted amazing! One thing that I particularly liked was the fact that you get to customize your taco toppings, similar to buying a Subway sandwich. There are various things to choose from and the workers really know how to fill that taco up! I would definitely recommend including Guac into whatever you choose to order because it really adds to the flavour and juiciness of the tacos. I also tried the Mexican Street Corn (which is served in a cup instead of as a cob). I was a huge fan of this, as it not only tasted great but was also a lot cleaner and easier to eat.   Overall, I think this is one of the best places to grab a bite in the Queen Street West area. It's delicious and inexpensive! 5/5 would recommend and would come back. I may be a tad bit biased though... I just really love tacos."}
{"text":"Came here on the spur of the moment and saw this modern, bright taco place and decided to try because it was nicely decorated and advertised as first taco place with charcoal tacos.  I got a small picadillo (ground beef,  pico de gallo,  grilled onions,  lettuce, mild sauce and without the raw onions) just to try.   I took it to go and it came in a little paper box take out container with a nice wax paper at the bottom. I was a little disappointed that the tortilla was neither hot nor room temperature and that it was neither crispy nor soft. It was somewhat chewy and painfried on one spot instead. The filling is okay, nothing flavourful and in my opinion,  I think Taco Bell tastes better.   The cashier also didn't ask me whether I wanted flour or corn tortilla when the menu gives the option,  and luckily they ended up giving me flour because that's what I would've told them.   A little pricey for $4.15 for this small taco. I think I'd try someplace else for tacos or any snack."}
{"text":"It has potential.  Biggest observation that I can muster is: They're clearly new.  The team didn't seem to vibe nor did they seem entirely knowledgeable. They have a promo person roaming the street with menu cards telling people that if they mentioned his name (Jose?) that they'd get a special deal when they ordered. Cut to the next day when I visit Mi Taco and mention said deal and she had NO idea what I was talking about. Was it all a scam? Doubtful. Not within such close proximity.  It just kind of soured my experience right off the bat.  The tacos themselves are okay. The stake and shrimp were really great, but I feel like there's much room to widen their variety of toppings.  We were asked to sit down without paying while the rest of our order was prepared, but when she brought them to us (after asking if we wanted them done up like our first two tacos) they didn't have sauce on them at all.  We were in quite a hurry, so we just took them as-is. They NEEDED the sauce, but we didn't want to wait for that to happen either.    I definitely think that the food has potential and, once the team starts to mesh a little more and a vibe can be reached between them, it will carry throughout the restaurant.  They have a million little tables- seems like it's not set up in the best way.  It was very clean and squeaky new.  There's not really a good place to wait for your food though- I wouldn't want to know what this place would be like during a lunchtime rush, should it ever had one.  The non-stop 90s music though- top notch. When was the last time you heard Len's Steal My Sunshine, am I right?"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos here, and I was disappointed with how bland it was. It lacked salt and spices, and seasoning in all the parts of the dish. Also, as a taqueria, one of the most important elements is the tortilla, which tasted flat and stale. I have had tortillas that are springier and have a more satisfying chew at other taquerias."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends before watching a movie at Scotiabank theatre. The restaurant is meant to be a quick-eat and go place. It's quite a small place with maybe about 5 tables- most people do takeout here. I ordered the 3 taco combo special for $10.95.You get to choose 3 tacos from the list which includes some of their classic tacos (beef, pork and chicken are there meat options) and vegan options. You go to the counter to place your order and they will give you a number and delivery the tacos to your table. Service was pretty and they got out our orders pretty quickly.   I chose the chicken, pork and beef tacos in the house made flour shells. Prices are pretty cheap and the portions they give out are pretty good. My tacos came loaded with meat and toppings which was great! Very delicious tacos and great flavours! They do not skimp on the meat so you get some good portions of the meat. I also ordered the baja fish tacos and that was quite tasty too! In addition, they also had $5 margaritas which were a nice drink to pair with your tacos!  Overall, great value for some delicious tacos! Will definitely be coming back here for more next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and ordered 3 tacos - 1 chicken, 1 beef and 1 pork. All were delicious but the  chicken was best as it had cilantro and caramelized onions on top. I think the tacos needed alittle bit of lime to add some acidity and make them 5/5 stars. I also would suggest adding some guacamole too. I ordered a side of chips and medium salsa and the chips were amaaazingggg. Polished them all off. Would definitely come back here for some quick, tasty tacos. They also make their tortillas in house and sell them separately. After eating these tacos, i didnt feel like i was eating fast food or anything, it felt healthy and light."}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by. It smelled delicious from the street so I had to try it. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Helped me make my choice right away. Amazing chorizo tacos! Great suggestion. The chicken burrito was also phenomenal, just as it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here through Foodora and the food arrives was not up to par in quality and in service. We ordered the beef brisket taco and chicken taco combo (x 2), added $0.50 on top for guacamole, and ordered guacamole on the side. It was unclear to us the guac did not include chips so we had to go buy our own chips (minus 1 star)  The tortilla was thick and steak was not juicy, it was dry and tough. I didn't enjoy it at all. We ordered 2 combos, paid our service and delivery fee. and basically nothing came out accordingly. I called the restaurant and spoke with a lady by the name of Lidia, I told her the guacamole was all over the place when it arrived. I know it wasn't their fault particularly (more Foodora) but she said she would reflect this to the account manager and get back to me which she never did (minus 2 stars) for not fulfilling what was promised. Do not promise something, you cannot do.  First and last time I will eat here, sorry you've lost me....   **UPDATE ON THIS:** FOODORA WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING AND PROVIDED ME WITH EXCELLENT RESOLUTION IN THIS MATTER. MI TACO IS STILL ON MY NOT TO GO LIST DUE TO THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD PROVIDED."}
{"text":"The stuffing inside was good, but the taco wrapping itself was hard and plain awful. It may be because we ate it after 20 minutes (since we had to walk back home), but I wouldn't come back again. Also, the rice was...pretty dry. I ordered the brisket and chicken tacos. Brisket and chicken stuffings saved the star rating.  Price is on par with other taco places in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"Messy food = good food. Taco plate is more than enough food at $10 and all the tacos are delicious. Jarritos Tamarind was sold out but they make their own Tamarind drink that is even better."}
{"text":"When Mi Taco opened more than a year ago I wasnt a big fan. After a couple of visits, I learned you can custom your taco to taste legitimate, and I understand that they have to cater to all clientele. This is the best place to come with people that have different perspectives of mexican food, they will do the burrito with pineapple salsa, as well as the humble carne asada taco with corn tortilla, one of my favorites. Their salsa is one of the spiciest, as while I recommend to keep your choices simple, you can definetly customize your taco."}
{"text":"Died and went back to Mexico.  Seriously though, fresh, Good and delicious.....so delicious that I am going back for lunch.  If you are on Queen West....go in and enjoy...oh and the Aguas are perfect. Super friendly and accommodating.....see you tomorrow."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food great service. A quick duck in from a long walk along queens street this place has delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Great tacos! A little on the smaller side but very tasty Place is very small, would not come with huge parties but the decor is very cute.  Chips and guacamole is very good Had the steak taco :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always look for places like these to eat at over large chain restaurants or upscale dining. Great place to stop for a nice lunch after lots of walking. Staff was super friendly & the burrito bowls were different than what you might be used to from other chains. Ingredients were fresh (you could see the chicken on the grill as you walked in). Plenty of seating with a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little shop. Prices are reasonable - $3.75 for a taco but it's the quality that makes it worth it. The ingredients are really fresh and the ground beef is definitely a winner. The chicken is decent too. The woman that works there with the long silver hair makes good recommendations, is quick and super nice. My boyfriend got the taco bowl and it's basically an entire styrofoam container filled with quality food. I'd definitely go back to try the fish. Altogether meal came out to $21 for 2 tacos, a taco bowl and a Jarritos mango pop."}
{"text":"The service was very pleasant. The food was really good. We got the Taco Plato and the beans and rice were an exquisite addition to the tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing burrito's!!! Good size! Chips and salsa tasty, guacamole awesome! Price decent!!"}
{"text":"It's my first time at Mi Taco and I was pretty excited to try it mostly because I'm starving today.   First impression- this place isn't too good for big groups. It's pretty small, and I imagine it is uncomfortable for anyone to eat here if you're in a group of 4 or more. I came alone today and it's perfect for that. I see lots of other people eating alone here.   The menu is in part Spanish by the way. I had to google what pescado was (it's fish). I proceeded to order the 'pescado' bowl then waited around 10 minutes to get a shrimp bowl. At least you can sit, grab a number and they will bring you the food.   The bowl definitely doesn't taste like chipotle, I'm not quite sure how to describe it. The rice is not what I'm used to for sure. Also half my box was refried beans which I'm not too crazy about. Oh and I got like 3 shrimps in my bowl.  Price wise, it's similar to chipotle. So would I come here over chipotle? No...  Pros: they have fish here, fresh ingredients   Cons: really small, too much beans   Would I come back? Probably not... If I do, I definitely won't order a bowl and I'll try the tacos instead"}
{"text":"Just stop by this little restaurant...staff is awesome and the tacos are flavoraful. We are happy about the quick bite experience!!"}
{"text":"Flavour was fantastic spot on. However portion was small and pricey. The rice was very dry nothing special. Would go again for tacos only"}
{"text":"I must have used 20 napkins to finish only 2 tacos because their tacos are super juicy. Decided to try the brisket taco and tinga pollo and have no regrets. If you decide to dine in the tacos are served on a metal tray with a paper lining that says \"mi taco\" on it. The presentation was mediocre but the tacos tasted fantastic. For both tacos the tortilla was chewy. The brisket was soft and flavourful, and tasted really good with cilantro sauce. I preferred this over the pollo (chicken) one which I decided to try with chipotle sauce.  Once you order they give you a plastic card with a number on it and you wait. The wait time was a bit longer (around 10 minutes for 2 tacos) but it was okay as it was a busy time (lunvh hour) with lots of customers. Limited and cramped seating though. Despite the longer wait times I would say for the amazing tacos it deserves a whopping 4/5."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by and grab a burrito from here before going to Scotiabank theatre for a movie and that turned out to be a great decision. I ordered at the front, grabbed a number and they brought my food to me when it was ready. The sitting area was a little cramped but I got my food to go so it didn't really affect my experience.   I ordered the beef brisket burrito, which came out to around $10. I personally really like their tortillas because it's freshly made and very chewy. My only complaint is that the beef was a little on the salty side. The portion was huge and I was completely stuffed by the end of it.  I would come again to try the tacos."}
{"text":"Stopped by here during Nuit Blanche and was pleasantly surprised at how cute the decor was and how fast the service was.  We ordered Chicken Tacos, a Chicken Burrito Bowl and  Chicken Burrito. All delicious!   Really loved that the tortillas they used were authentic and fresh!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this taqueria for a quick bite to eat. Got two tacos, one brisket and the other carnitas both on corn tortillas. It's a narrow shop with seating at the back that is a bit reminiscent of old diners. The staff were friendly and worked quite quickly. Took my number and had a seat.   I received my tacos and there were yum. The spicy crema, and the cojita cheese melded perfectly with the tender and juicy meat. My bites were so ferocious the filling began to leak out the back. That's what I get I suppose. I might just stop by again to try their burritos when I pass by this way again."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. They just did a big remodel and it looks a.m. isn't. Very festive and day of the dead like with those colourful flags everywhere.   I got the chicken taco and the shrimp one. I always get the shrimp it's the best for sure but sometimes they do run out of that one. You get to pick your spice level and what kind of sour cream. Love who you can customize it."}
{"text":"Small taco place , the tacos were decent . They could of added more stuff in the small tacos that were given.And I love when my food is hot , and the food was warm . The rice was hot though . Anywaysss . :)  I wasn't really satisfied !!"}
{"text":"Friendly little taco joint with overall tasty burritos and tacos (they have other stuff too but I've only had burritos and tacos)  They make the flour tortillas in house and they are quite good. Get these and don't get the corn tortillas (which are average) or the whole wheat tortillas.   The spiciness level is fairly low (even when you ask for spicy), but they have some other hot sauces available that can bring up the heat level a bit.   Enjoyable and good"}
{"text":"Had the brisket tacos - the brisket just melts in your mouth. Even the sides of rice and refried beans are delicious. And they deliver, too!"}
{"text":"So fresh, tasty, and a great place for a casual date or hangout. Decor and ambience is very cute and reminds me of a night market in Mexico.  Ranking of tacos we tried: Shrimp Taco: juicy, fresh, best of the bunch Beef Taco: smoky, juicy, and delicious Fish Taco: not fried, tasty, and tender Pork Taco: seasoning on point  Chicken Taco: average flavouring, nothing you would miss  Ambience is intimate, I would advise avoiding for groups or just getting take out.  I ordered the fish taco, shrimp taco, and elote. My favourite by far was the shrimp taco - so juicy with fresh ingredients that complimented each other perfectly. The flour tortillas are so good! I had no idea what a difference freaky made tortillas could make.  Boyfriend ordered the beef, pork, and chicken 3 taco plate. He was also thoroughly impressed with his tacos and food.  We will definitely be back for the shrimp and beef tacos! Excited to find a regular taco place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Cozy, cute Mexican place with friendly service! We stopped in for burritos before a movie and I was so pleased to find they had vegetarian/vegan options.  I think the seitan could have used more seasoning, but that's my only complaint. I loved their tortilla, it was so thin! Excited that there's a good quick dining burrito option with more than just beans and cheese or sweet potato as the vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I got one chicken burrito and one carne mechada taco. Ufff delicious. I also got two margaritas that were perfectly made by Alex the bartender. Awesome guy btw. Definitely coming back again. A must stop if you come to Toronto."}
{"text":"The soft tacos were delicious. I had the cod and the chicken both medium. I don't like really spicy food and found this medium just right. side of guacamole. My boyfriend had the brisket and shrimp. Both really good. the street corn with crema was very delicious. They take it off the cob and put the kernels in a cup. they have coke made in Mexico. Very casual nice place for great food."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little shop on the busy Queen street minutes away from osgood station. We just happened to pass by here one night right before they closed, so it wasn't too busy. The service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant itself was clean and well lit.  We ordered the brisket and the carnitas taco on corn tortillas and picked a seat. (If you have a thing for finished wooden slabs as tables, you'll love the wood bar tables at the back!) The brisket was well flavoured and tender, and it came with chopped onions/tomatoes and condiments. But what I really liked was the carnitas taco. The meat is braised pork, but combined with the sauce and cilantro it was delicious. The portions are small if you order by itself, but they have combos that are bound to fill you up for a very decent price.   If you're around Queen street and need to grab a quick bite, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp. I've been a major consumer of the reviews and restaurant suggestions from Yelp so figured it was time to start contributing.  I just walked into this place off the street - I was hungry! I ordered the steak burrito bowl (don't remember the name on the menu) to stay.  I was disappointed! They were stingy with the meat, a few tiny pieces of dry steak. I'm assuming this is because I walked in post lunch rush hour, but still not an excuse. The plate was \"buffed\" up with abnormal amounts of whipped bean paste of som sorts, rice and lettuce.  I wouldn't come here. again, can't speak for the lunch service, most restaurants fast food places not named McDonalds tend to ration the food so as to not have waste."}
{"text":"As someone who had tacos in Mexico and San Diego, the tacos at this place was definitely legit!   I got the taco combo with carne casada and the shrimp taco with beans and rice. Food was reasonably priced and service was great. They got lime water on deck always so that's a bonus!   Also it's a small family owned place, rare to see that in Toronto so will definitely be supporting this place!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious. Its not the cheapest but fresh ingredients and good quality. The place is cute too with colorful decor and great music."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that this place has flourished into a really great spot and the food has also improved (though I already liked it to begin with).   The shrimp and fish tacos are incredible - they season them just right, the toppings are delicious but don't take away from the natural flavours of the fish and shrimp. The seafood is really good quality and there's a good amount in each taco. I'm not sure exactly what the toppings are - I can taste sauteed-until-basically-caramelized onions and a host of other complex, fragrant flavours - but they complement the fish and the shrimp so perfectly. I've been craving this all the time and I feel good about eating it because the seafood is grilled instead of fried, and there are all kinds of fresh veggies in them.  They've decorated the space really charmingly (and they got rid of the fruit flies!) - it'd be a great spot to go to with friends or on a date. The prices have increased a bit but are still very reasonable. Your food is prepared fresh to order. I'm so happy they're doing well and I'm happy to keep returning!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with no expectations. Burrito Boyz is my usual go to for burrito bowls but this place is definitely on my new go to list. I had the pork carnitas in a burrito bowl. The pork is seasoned just right and portions were appropriate. I like that they have different cream sauces including chipotle and cilantro lime. I like that this bowl didn't feel heavy despite finishing it all. I could've probably stopped at 2/3 of the way and been comfortably full. Instead I'm battling food coma. Guac on the menu seemed a bit overpriced so I didn't opt for any but I think I misread the sign for appetizers. Will absolutely come here again and they have Ritual too!"}
