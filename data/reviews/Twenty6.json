{"text":"Fun time on Friday nite. Sat by the water and listened to live music.   Food was okay but Happy Hour prices made it better. Smaller beer list but good selection of wine.   Nicely designed outdoor space. Hotel like indoor space. Pleasant server but was waiting on too many tables.   Still worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place is way under rated! So goooood!  We come to the JW every summer for about 7 years. The food used to be great then fell off for a couple years so we were always eating across the street. But tonight we were desperately hungry and too lazy to leave the hotel so we ordered pretzel bites, wings, and cheese platter - omg i was pleasantly surprised and wished we ate here more during our trip!!! The wings were amazing, you get like 10 huge wings for $15, so worth it.  Ditch the pool food and eat here trust me!"}
{"text":"Delicious, courteous, friendly...  This little gem, nested on the first floor lobby of the elegant JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort & Spa, offers elegant atmosphere, delectable bites and a friendly, hard-working wait staff.   Their food is delicious and filling. My husband and I snacked on treats while watching a football game. In the evening we sat outdoors by the fire and snacked on the Artisan Cured Meats and Local Cheese Board. The selection was simple and just enough to satisfy our need to snack.   Decaf coffee at night was very good. We enjoyed an Argentinian Malbec as well."}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner/drink because I was stuck in the resort and didn't want to trek for a late Sunday dinner,. Probably should have gone exploring for new stuff, but wasn't overly disappointed.  Started off with the Spice Market Old Fashioned. It is wickedly good. I'm an old-school old fashioned fan and it really isn't one of those - but I enjoyed the heck out of it anyway. Really wish I had some peeps to keep me company so I could have had another.  Anyway, I was alone and those meals usually go fast. Sat at some uber cool seating area. If I was a beautiful, stylish person - it would have worked. As someone trying to scarf a meal in a bar, it was a little awkward.  I ordered the Turkey & Avocado BLT. It was very good. Only down side is that the bread was so toasted (stale?) that every bite broke it up like a shattered piece of glass. Difficult to eat as it was intended, but it tasted just fine. It came with a side of chips. The waiter seemed apologetic, but I thought they were well spiced with some sort of BBQ seasoning thing. It worked for me for a quick meal where there aren't a lot of options unless you are throwing some serious dinero around."}
{"text":"This is a review for the cocktail bar  and my inner lush loves it. Sure , happy hour ends at 5, like serious, wth right, but that aside the place is awesome. I initially ordered a Vieux Carré  but they did not have the Bénédictine for the drink but the bartender improvised with some B&B and it was just as delicious. He also made us some mean old fashioneds and gimlets. Excellent all round when it comes to his craft. They had a superlative selection of single malts and I think it numbered well over a hundred at a quick glance and heck that's just my kinda bar ! The service was top notch as one may expect and I wish i had found this place earlier !"}
{"text":"I have around 30 check-ins at this Marriott. It used to be my go-to spot where I would swing by after work and avoid the 5PM traffic on the 101 and just kick it back with a glass of vino and some appetizer near the fire pits on the outside patio.   Service is phenomenal, always smiley and helpful staff members to get you a refill or anything you might be needing, very neat and clean all over, food is always tasty and comes out on time and warm. It's just something you'd expect to get from a 5 star hotel.  Their flatbreads and cocktails are on point and they have seasonal beers on tap and some really cool local brews.   Did I mentioned that one of my favorite breweries up in Flagstaff makes their twenty6 beer? Yup, it's Mother Road Brewing.  You will not be disappointed by this place if you decide to swing by and relax outside by the fire pits or catch a game of football inside the lounge/lobby/bar area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, where to begin, we ended each night of our vacation with a cocktail at this wonderful JW Marriot cocktail lounge.  Met wonderful people each night.  The drinks were great and the bartenders very attentive.  I never wanted to leave. The short rib sliders, which I had twice, were fantastic.  Excellent atmosphere. Really hoping to have another stay here soon."}
{"text":"Do not miss this spot!  If you are staying at the hotel find your way to it on the first floor, if you are close by make your way in for some special cocktails and tasty food.  This is not your typical bar food.  I had the short rib sliders with the home made chips with a Spice Market Old Fashioned cocktail for lunch.  These folk know what they are doing and serve it well.  I wish Miami was not so far away!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. On my stay here, I stopped in 3 times. The first time I had an awful experience. I ordered the burger medium rare, it was fully cooked and I did not enjoy it at all. Although the sweet potato fries were delicious! I came in for a quick breakfast one morning which was good. The last time I ordered the turkey club and thought it was great!"}
{"text":"Located inside the JW Desert Ridge, the food at twenty6 is overpriced as you would expect for a hotel bar, but the happy hour (2-5pm daily) is pretty good. During happy hour, they have $6 margaritas (too sweet), sangria, wine, and beer. The deviled eggs ($8 during happy hour) were very good, but still a little pricey. You're really paying for the nice seats and atmosphere. They have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. During the day you can watch birds - I saw one tearing a part a smaller bird on one of the chairs, which was an unusual but interesting experience...   On one last note, the JW Marriott \"signature beer\" is actually quite nice. It's a kolsch, made by a local brewery and has some nice honey flavors. I would get that again if I came back."}
