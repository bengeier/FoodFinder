{"text":"If your looking for authentic Chinese in az this is the spot. You may find restaurants like this all over Los Angeles but this is a special place when it comes to Arizona."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had!  The House Special Chicken had and amazing flavor with a delicious crispy outside and tender white chicken on the inside, couldn't stop eating it!! The garlic fried rice was full of flavor.  We also ordered the sizzling beef plater. This was good, too. The service was unbelievably fast! We will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Wong's never disappoints! If you are going for a trendy place to eat Wong's is not the place for you. If you want some authentic, hole in the wall Chinese food the definitely check it out. My husband and I have fallen in love with this cute little place and it's definitely one of our go to dinner spots."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1995. I have to admit I'm not a big trainees food person I only order a couple items and the items that I ordered were always good.. I always get their spare ribs the most amount of meat on a rib that I ever had in any Chinese Restaurant.also the  General Tso's chicken and the sweet and sour pork are very good I would have gave the five but the interior is very drab and dull Eddie needs a makeover...."}
{"text":"I love crappy Chinese food.  I don't mean that it's bad quality or anything.  Having lived on the East Coast a few years, I miss the little Chinese restaurants - tiny little places, nothing fancy, inexpensive, that serve up good sized portions of Chinese food.  I have no idea what authentic is.  What I do know, is what tastes good.

I've lived half a mile (at most) from this place for a few years and have always wanted to try it.  Wife isn't a fan of Chinese food, so I just never got around to it.  Finally tried it last weekend and was very happy.

Very nondescript looking place, nothing special on the inside, though it did appear clean (at least from the front where I was standing).  The guy who took my order (and who I assume also served me when I went to pick up) was very nice.  

I had the Kung Pao chicken, which to me seems like a very generic meal - something that is a good measuring stick on which to judge Chinese restaurants (like ordering Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant...I always try that first).  

The egg drop soup was quite nice as well -- pretty thick, but very simple, very tasty.

I should be clear - it's nothing fancy.  It's not out of this world amazing.  It is good.  It is inexpensive.  It is a pretty decent portion size.  It was *exactly* what I wanted.  

I'll be back...next step is to convince the wife to try something from here."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed! There's a great selection of lunch combos and the price is great.

The lunch combos come with soup, rice, a chicken wing, and a cream puff to make a great, rounded meal.

Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the authentic traiditional chinese place. (Authentic rating 3/5).
Food taste and presentation 4/5
Cost 5/5 Unbelivably cheap
Freshness 5/5
Hospitatlity 4/5.
Ordered the KungPao Vegetables and it was really good and definetly not like in other places. Still a bit greasy but really excellent with a nice balance of taste, flavor and spices with greasiness. KIds ordered the Wong Ju Chicken and Schezhuan Chicken and the liked it too. (Was scared since they have never tasted much authentic food and always a PF Changs fans).
Living so close to this place, and visting the adjacent complex for more than 100 times, I have never visited this place. Thanks to my son who found this authentic place. I would go here anyday than any other Chinese places or PF Chang chains or Pei Wei chains or Panda Express chains.
This is a sit and dine so given them some time to cook your food. This place is also run by elderly people and so dont expect the over whelming hospitality you get in PF Chang or Olive garden's. 
If you want good food and some relaxing atmopshere and want to be casual the best place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Wongs ever since I moved to Tempe almost 2 years ago. The food is fantastic and authentic! 

My grandparents used to own a Chinese restaurant, so I grew up around this type of industry. Wongs is everything a Chinese restaurant should be! The staff is professional, the food is delicious, and the service is FAST!

I love this place and eat here maybe twice a month.

My only itch with Wongs is the establishment itself. The interior is a little outdated and could definitely use some love! However, this does not change its 5/5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for at least 10 years and are yet to be disappointed. The service is amazing, and the food is something special! I recommend the pan fried noodles and Hoonan tofu 

It's vegetarian friendly and they can accommodate whatever you need if you specify. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always look for a few differentiators at Chinese restaurants; the quality of the meat and the taste of the rice.  The meat here was good quality, but did not stand out from others.  The rice just wasn't very flavorful, very simple, bland and typical.  The bottom line, for the price, this is a solid support to get your meat and veggies in a sauce fix, but if you are a rice or noodles person, you'll have to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service was great. The owner was really nice, and very sensitive of needs of my party (a friend that had a disability)
I had Mapo Tofu. It was okay.

When I came home my man told me about the server who squashed a cockroach with his hand and showed it to his co-worker.
I barfed about half an hour after that."}
{"text":"Went back again and had the sea bass, string beans, and Singapore rice noodles - Delicious!

BTW, The pot stickers and spare ribs are a nice starter.

 And always great service."}
{"text":"Best chinese I've have in the valley, hands down.  The egg rolls are absolutely to die for and their quality of their food and their excellent service keeps us coming back regularly.  I never leave reviews on yelp, but I had to create an account to give these guys props."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been coming here for 10+ years and have tried a variety of entrees and have never been disappointed! My favorite is always the Wong Jo Chicken. Yeah, so the decor is a little dated..does it matter if the food is delicious?! Nom! Nom! Nom!"}
{"text":"The food is kind of greasy but not all that bad. Good place but would not really go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Very oily but still the best Chinese anywhere near Tempe."}
{"text":"Love the Wong Jo chicken.  First time I tried it in 1997 was at lunch with some friends.  I came back the same night for dinner it was so good.  I have converted my friends and family into believers as well."}
{"text":"Not a very good first impression. My water came in a glass that had very obvious lipstick stains on the it and my spoon had stains that showed someone had recently used it to stir tea or coffee. 

There are two menus a blue one which is given to \"Asians\" and a pink one which is given to everyone else. Ask for the blue if you want \"more Asian\" choices.

I had Egg Flower Soup, Egg Rolls and Singapore Style Rice Noodles and added chicken , only comes with pork. Soup was good, egg rolls were typical buy they frozen throw they in the deep fryer and server them soggy and greasy. The Singapore noodles weren't bad and they weren't great either. Not enough curry or spice oils, so not enough heat. This is supposed to be a spicey dish. It also seemed very dry, did not seem like the meats were cooked fresh and I was the first customer in the door for lunch so being early May be a drawback if they start prepping too early.

By comparison, Wong's Jr. In Peoria, this same dish (can be served how you want from mild to spice) comes with a great mixture of shrimp, pork, egg and snow peas. The price is the same and I think Wong Jr. Portion are bigger.

I guess if I was in the area again I would eat here again, but thoroughly check for dirty silverware and glasses before you drink or eat."}
{"text":"Wongs was phenomenal. Wong ho chicken with garlic fried rice!!! Sadly wongs is gone. New place diff menu"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. One of the best kept secrets in the valley.  A small restaurant so if you have a party of 8 or more make a reservation.  I go to Wong's place every chance I get which is not often enough as I am traveling most of the time and eating out at restaurants all over the country.  I wish there was a place like this everywhere I travel.  

I give this place 5 stars because of the price compared to the quality of food, casual atmosphere, and mostly because of the awesome service.  If I didn't go into this place for 6 months and walk in, the waiters remember what I have ordered in the past and they go the extra mile to have me try meals that I might like. This place is so casual that anyone should have no reservation about telling them if you ordered something you didn't like or have a problem with anything.  These folks are that awesome. You would be hard pressed to find such a nice place or people.   Even the \"Duke of A Mountain\"  and his family eat here often and these folks could eat anywhere they desire. 

Thanks Mr. Wong and Staff,   We love your place as do many others.

Guy & Friends"}
{"text":"Was at this place two years ago and it was one of  my favorite . However on this day we had been waiting for the order when off the side I noticed a big ass cockroach on the wall. No big deal it wasn't in my food . Week later I ordered to go and just as I was finishing off my rice I saw one big antenna from one bis ass ..... Yes cockroach.... I am sorry to say I still have a hard time with rice. But not from this place. It is much too bad because I loved this place. I hope that the owners have rectified this......"}
{"text":"Food is really good! Decently priced especially the lunch specials. Sea Bass dish is superb although it is only seasonal. I've been going here for a couple of year and this mom and pop shop is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is probably the best place to get authentic Chinese food in Arizona. The pan fried shrimp with shell on is my favorite. I haven't have anything from here that I don't like. The owner is nice and he's always at the restaurant. He is super nice and will even make special order for you if requested. Free hot tea! The staff is extremely nice and they know what they're doing. 

The menu can be a little overwhelming, a lot of choices to chose from. But it also means you'll never get bored with their foods."}
{"text":"great food! Love house deluxe wonton soup!"}
{"text":"As a part-Chinese who grew up near a big Chinatown, I wanted a restaurant that had authentic good food like I could find at home.  My Taiwanese pals took me here and I've been eating here once a week ever since.  The service is great and the food is out of this world!  My favorites are the Mongolian beef and the Beef with snow peas, but I've tried many of their other dishes and all of them were just as good.  Don't know what you want?  Tell the waiter what you like...type of meat, spicy or sweet, etc...and he'll come back with a dish so satisfying, you'll think the chef read your mind!  I LOVE this place!  It's fairly quiet on weekday nights but weekend nights are busier."}
{"text":"This is our family's secret joint for Chinese food. Never had anything there I didn't like. Also great pricing. Gotta try their HUGE Dumplings! If u r a person who like \"real\" Chinese food  or your American \"chi chi\" Chinese food (sweet n sour, orange chicken, etc) you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Well I was in search of lunch and happened by this place from yelp. Everyone gave this place the best reviews and well although I may be raving about it this place is really good.

I hate to evesdrop but I couldn't help but overhear the group in the booth in front of me and behind me just talking about how they are all getting their regulars and chatting it up with the waiter. This place gives off a nice homey feeling. It is very welcoming from the staff.

The food I got was recommened from my waiter it was ok but I really didn't know what I was ordering and got this stirfry of sauce,chicken, and veggies; every veggie I hate btw. So not their problem really I should have asked. The meal was good though. The rice was great and there was a piece of just fried chicken with my meal which was great. I think next time I will just get fried chicken and soup."}
{"text":"First off I have ordered to go here many times and the food was great. Last night for our first time we decided to dine in. We came in and was seated on the west wall in a both, our waiter was quick to arrive and take our drink order and drop off menus. we all ordered and waited for our food. Mine arrived first Beef and Chinese broccoli looked great. I took my first bite and looked up at my son and saw a large COCKROACH run behind him on the both I quietly told him to get up and I tried to kill it. I then motioned for the waiter as he was bringing out the rest of our orders and informed him of the nasty little bug and he said sorry we sprayed last week and walked away. Within seconds two more one on the table and one on the booth next to my son I grabbed my napkin and killed the one on the table got up and took it to the Owner Manager? and informed him my family and I would not be eating at his restaurant and he needed to take care of this obvious pest issue he quickly took the napkin with the ROACH from me and said ok thank you. We left 2 plates of untouched food on the table and I had taken two bites of mine I will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, their eggdrop soup is delicious, waiter staff is extremely friendly and their food is to drool for."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. Typical Chinese restaurant, nothing special. I like that it is NOT a chain. The service was subpar. We were asked for our order when we sat down but hadn't looked at the menu yet. A  v E R y long time later we got to order. The place had customers but wasn't full. It seemed to take a long time to get our food.

Loved the salt and pepper spicy eggplant! I was surprised that it was fried but it was really tasty. The shrimp sautéed with vegetables were done perfectly. Plump and juicy and plentiful. Two of my dining companions ordered off the full meal deal menu. Both the almond chicken and sweet and sour pork were entrees from my childhood which made for a mostly hate-love relationship with Chinese food. The portion size was just right. 

Yes I would go back if I am in the neighborhood and I didn't get snagged by a Thai place!."}
{"text":"When I lived in Tempe i would eat here religiously, and I really don't know what all these bad reviews are about. Wong's is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley, and I've tried a bunch of them. Now that I live in Phoenix I have to make a pilgrimage when I need my fix, but it's always worth it, guaranteed.

Yes, there are 2 menus, a pink one for the uninformed and the blue one for the people who want something a bit more traditional... I am salivating right now thinking of the garlic chicken, and the salt and pepper eggplant. oh, and the garlic fried shrimp... and the sizzling beef short ribs. and the wong jo chicken. and the tu-mu Chinese greens... and the pork with preserved vegetables. and the three flavors sizzling rice soup... yeah, I could keep going, but I see these lousy reviews and I feel that I need to represent for good ol' Wong's.

I must admit that I am not fancy, and that I do like my restaurants a little gritty. Some may be put off by the weird decor, but I think it's really cool (there's a river on the ceiling or something... or are they clouds? I just don't know)!

I have always had a fulfilling experience here, the food is always great, the service is always good, and the prices are really reasonable. Wong's probably isn't the place for you if you are the one who orders sweet and sour chicken where ever you go... To everyone that seems to flat out hate it, you really need to go back and try something else, because they have something for everybody, and it's all really pretty great."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. Authentic Hong Kong style cuisine. Friendly and caring service, and a nice, quiet atmosphere that let's you know you've just left the desert behind for something amazing. Been eating here since 1998, and never gonna stop!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Wong's since I was a small child, and I never get tired of it! I have recently moved to Tucson, which is super inconvenient considering no other Chinese food restaurant even compares to Wong's. The food is delicious, service is great, and prices are low. I try to stop in every time I am in the area, it never disappoints! Hands down, my favorite Chinese restaurant. I recommend the mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and hunan tofu (vegan)."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE, I usually will order the Pot Stickers (awesome), House Won Ton Soup, Beef Chow Fun w/ Egg sauce spicy, Mongollian Beef, and their version of the Generals Chicken.  The menu is huge and its fun to try something new each time.  The Chicken Chow Mein tastes like everyone elses so I dont order it here."}
{"text":"YAY! Wong's is back! NOW called \"Mandarin House\" same decor, menu & chef (as far as I can tell - I've only had the noodles but they were STILL the BEST DANG NOODLES since San Francisco!) 
Definitely read my review on Wong's here, or read the reviews on \"Mandarin House\" by others, or better yet - go to Wongs/Mandarin House & get some noodles or whatever you fancy!"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think Yelpers in Arizona have been so deprived of good ethnic food that they think every mediocre hole in the wall is worthy of 4-5 stars. On the plus side, the owner is a kindly old gent, my waiter was very attentive, and their prices are low.  Unfortunately, the food (I had a chicken dish) was just really fair at best. The spare ribs were AWFUL and nothing at all like Chinese pork! The ribs were brown meat cooked in a salty brown sauce that tasted like eating burned pot roast and some parts were too tough to chew. The hot and sour soup was just lame, barely tangy and no pork thrown in for flavor. I really think Panda Express is a lot better than this."}
{"text":"I was a former Wong's Fan.  I don't know if something else changed, but last month when we went there, the food had fallen several notches.   We were a large party and we ordered 7-8 entrees to share.    None of them were great.

I don't know what happened but we haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went here for lunch. It was something new. We loved it! It was amazing. The food was delicious and the staff was very polite to us. The portions were on point and the bill was low for the amount of food given. I recommend this place HIGHLY!!"}
{"text":"Salt & Pepper pork, sizzling beef short rib, garlic fried shrimp...  Oh my...

All their soups are good especially the sizzling rice & the hot & sour seafood...

What started off as an appetizer selection of the fried chicken wings has now evolved into a \"two orders please\" main course star!

If you \"have to\" have a veggie dish, pan fried garlic green beans is solid..."}
{"text":"Either you love the place and go back, or you really just don't like it.  Seriously.

The place was recommended to me by a girl I worked with who practically grew up in the Asian restaurants in the east valley, Wong's included.  After I went there the first time, I took my boyfriend there two days later - I liked it that much!  Then I recommended it to a close friend, who loves it as well.

The food was tasty, the servers are always friendly to me - though the older gentleman who works there can be a bit gruff - and I never want for a drink as my cup is always full.

I've had Chinese food in other cities - and no, its hard to compare with some place like San Fransisco.  Chinese food is better there from my experience, but the greater Phoenix area isn't known for being a foodie mecca like SF or NY.

None the less, it's a good meal and is on our list of staple go-out places.

The things I generally get there are the beef with oyster sauce, moo shu chicken or mongolian beef.  My boyfriend likes a variety of other things - but we both love the sizzling rice soup.  Its awesome.

Ultimately, Chinese is a pretty subjective food more so than alot of other cuisine.  Everyone has a specific taste set for it in their palates it seems, so give it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I've been going there for years.   The food is fantastic and the servers are pretty attentive. The salt and pepper chicken wings is ridiculously good!  Give it a try if you're a fan of wings.  

Great place to go for Chinese food.

The decor could use an upgrade though, if you care about that sort of thing.  It doesn't take away from their food and service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since I was 8 years old. It's been 12 years of amazing food! I seriously love this place. Their servers are so nice and work extremely hard. I recommend the sizzling beef spare ribs (my absolute favorite), garlic chicken, salt and pepper eggplant, and the salt and pepper pork. The almond pudding that you get at the end of the meal is so delicious. I've tried to recreate it and have failed numerous times. Wong's Place will always be one of my favorite restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure that I like Wong's Place.  Both times I've been here I've had to send the soup back for another variety.  

The first time I had hot and sour and didn't like it so I asked for egg drop.  The egg drop soup came back and it was okay.  The second time I remembered that I didn't like the hot and sour and order the egg drop but this time the egg drop tasted funny.  So I asked for Wonton instead.  The Wonton was okay.

Both times I had Wong Jo chicken as a lunch special.  I wasn't really feeling it on my second visit.  Matter of fact, the second time I visited I brought my whole family and we all had lunch.  I tasted most everyone's entrees and wasn't really all that impressed.  

They all had basic things like sweet and sour chicken, mongolian beef, sweet and sour shrimp.  Things that normally you would think would be pretty good as they're very standard.  Nothing spectacular.  

The accompanying photo is of the Wong Jo chicken from my first visit.

I'm not really feeling Wong's Place.  I don't think I'll be back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"So we came here because a co-worker heard that this place was supposed to be good. WTF??? Aren't all places \"supposed to be\" good? Yeah, I know - some don't even aspire to be. This place is about as Americanized Chinese food as they get. Sure - if it works and you have customers that are loyal to you (like I saw from printed letters posted on the wall next to the cash register) why change out the formula? So we all got the lunch specials. I got the Szechuan pork. All the meals came with soup and crab puffs. Egg drop soup - ok, nothing I'm gonna wake up in a cold sweat at 3AM suddenly craving. The Szechuan pork dish was rather bland. Everybody else also claimed that their dishes were rather bland as well adding either soy sauce or hot sauce. Survey says: not part of our lunch rotation. Lotsa parking - shares a lot with the Baseline Pub - which we passed on the way to our car while being eyed by some sketchy looking old day drinker. Just east of the mall at the southeast corner of McClintock and Baseline that has Lucky Break, China Town Buffet, Little India, and Chutney's Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"Wong's place has been touted as \"some of the best in the area\" and \"Hands down the best Chinese food in the valley.\"  I'm not from the area so I don't have a lot to compare to but if Wong's is the best in the area, then I'm a bit disappointing that the Tempe area doesn't know what some really outstanding Chinese food should taste like.  

Wong's is a decent average place with mediocre chinese food at reasonable prices.  And the people who work there are very nice people.  It's hard to go wrong with the house pan fried sizzling noodle at any kind of Chinese restaurant (although I wish the noodles were a bit thinner)."}
{"text":"I had some noodle soup and fried rice here.  Both were mediocre.  The prices are low, so I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Wong's is fast, friendly, tasty and easy on the wallet.  Nothing fancy but consistently good."}
{"text":"Very good, place is not the nicest looking but food is tasty. Favorite was the house pan fried noodles."}
{"text":"Wong's Place is now Mandarin House Tempe.  Nicely remodelled but the food is not the same.  Lemon chicken was horrible.  Other entres not good.  Avoid avoid!  This place wont last long."}
{"text":"It would be nice if info was shared that they are closed! Especially if someone drives far because it has good reviews! Disappointed"}
{"text":"Sizzling rice soup and salt/pepper pork...Done!"}
{"text":"Wongs used to be the best Chinese food in the valley but it has gone down hill in the last 3 or 4 years. Wongs was on par with some of the best SF Chinese restaurants 6-7 years ago.  However, it has gotten cheap.  The restaurant is often dirty with bugs and flies. The tables are dirty. The food is too oily now.  The preparation seems to have taken a hit as well.  We ordered a vegetarian item and they cooked it in fish sauce so the whole item smelled and tasted of fish. That's just laziness on their part as they obviously recycled oil.  I will consider getting take-out but the food has gone down hill. 

There are better restaurants in the valley now: 1. Gourmet House of Hong Kong 2. Big Wong and 3. China Chile ...all in downtown are better"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Wongs Place since Mrs Wong sat people and Mr Wong worked the kitchen.  We like the Wong Jo Chicken, Sizzling Pepper Steak Platter and Tom Yum Seafood soup.  The seaweed salad is great in the summer and as regulars we are always served \"almond jello\" for desert.  We always get what ever greens are fresh with garlic sauce and since we seem to aways be celebrating a birthday, we order noodles for long life right.  Anyway, we like the place as a local family joint where we can dine, visit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Over priced and not very flavorful.  We ordered Cashew Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken.  Neither of the meals had very much meat, they were loaded with veggies & huge chucks of mushrooms to compensate for the lack of meat.  The Cashew Chicken didn't have much taste to it, it was extremely bland and the Kung Pao had a little more flavor simply because it was spicy.  Overall, we were not very satisfied and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST Chinese food you will ever have. I have been going here for several years!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here recently since I live in the neighborhood. The food was average fare for a Chinese restaurant, nothing outstanding as far as I could taste. The ambiance was lacking and the air conditioner should have been used a little more liberally. I have read the other reviews about Wong's, so I was a little disappointed. I will probably give it another shot sometime, but with Chuy's next door it might be awhile."}
{"text":"Service is great . Stopped  by their food was very greasy today with msg . Very disappointed.  The oil was very dark and again the food was salty"}
{"text":"Wong's Place is my favorite little family-owned neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  It has the quaint charm that is typical of a hole-in-the-wall Asian dining establishment, complete with the pastel decor reminiscent of the 80's.  The staff is the same loyal, polite staff that has been serving there for years and the service is consistently impeccable.  The staff always greets us with a familiar smile, the food is always delicious, my glass is always full, and the prices are very modest.  Although I have had many of their entrees, a few come to mind as the standalone, \"must have\" dishes to recommend above all others.  The Seafood Hot & Sour Soup is by far the most delectable option on the menu!  It is far different than the standard hot & sour fare and is filled with mussels, shrimp & squid, green onions and mushrooms in a spicy red broth.....it makes my mouth water with delight when I think of it!  Everyone that tries it keeps coming back for it, no matter how far the drive!  A few other faves are the Wong Jo Chicken with black mushrooms and ginger and the Pork Fried Rice.  If you have a large party to entertain, Wong's offers a special dinner price that is all inclusive and large family-style tables so that  everyone can share.  It is not uncommon for the place to be packed with families at dinner time on the weekends.  If it is fine dining or gourmet Chinese ambiance that you are looking for, you won't find it here, BUT....I highly recommend Wong's if you are looking for a delicious neighborhood fare for a great price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant!  

There's not one thing that I've had that I didn't like and I've had about 35% of this menu. Always ask for the \"Blue\" menu and you won't go wrong.  This menu specializes in authentic Chinese Szechaun dishes.  The menu is available for lunch or dinner.  When I'm missing my mom's cooking, I always end up here.  I'll even ask them to concoct something up when I'm in a daring mood and it's always good.

My favorite dishes are: 
Pan Fried Shrimp - If anyone in your party is squeamish, this is a warning.. it's cooked whole with the eyes!
Seafood Chow Fun - wide rice noodles with shrimp, scallops and squid. You won't find this at Panda Express!
Salty Fish Fried Rice - Preserved salted dried fish and chicken stir fried in rice. This is not your standard fried rice and it has a very strong fish taste/smell. Only the brave should try this!
Szechaun Green Beans - Pork and green beans. A little on the spicy side. This is no longer on the menu, but if you ask for it, they'll prepare it and you'll love it! 

I always want to try another dish, but I love the dishes that I've had and it's so hard to decide what to order once I get there. 

They serve an excellent dessert that's included with your meal... very refreshing.

I have been coming here for 15+ years. How many restaurants can tell you that their staff have been with them that long? Not many, but these owners take care of their employees quite well as there is very little turnover. I have brought many of my in town and out of town friends here and not once have I been disappointed!"}
{"text":"For the most part it's not as good as what I'm accustomed to when visiting San Francisco. But the sizzling rice soup is as good as anywhere ever and this is pretty much our go to Chinese place. What one person considers great is just a matter of personal taste, but you should give this place a try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat.  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food), we decided to give Wong's Place a shot.  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce.  Neither of the dishes were really that great.  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd prefer.

And to seal the deal, a classmate of mine whom I saw working there, later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly \"recycle\" the rice there.  You got it, the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to you.

If you're looking for legit Chinese food, you're better off going somewhere else.

Edit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:

1. Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me, but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)
2. Panda Express
3. Subway
4. Filibertos

As you can see, while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at, it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's.  Please, just let them go the way of Chrysler and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wong's has the best Chinese food in town! The waiters are very friendly and accommodating.  I would have rated it 5 stars but I couldn't get past the condition of the restaurant door--literally!  The handle has been taped up with electrical tape for at least a couple years and the windows could stand a cleaning. Because Wong's is next to a bar, the bar patrons smoke right outside the restaurant.  If you can ignore the surroundings, you won't be disappointed by the food!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 4 or so years for one reason...  The hunan chicken,  it's friggen delicious.  Will be a returning customers for as long as they are around.   

Great service and atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been coming here ever since it was recommended to me by Bobby T. (below). The two things I love most are the Wong Jo Chicken and the Fried Chicken and Garlic Sauce. The Wong Jo has an interesting flavor to it, it's sweet yet spicy with a kick of ginger. As for the fried chicken in garlic sauce, well the name says it all. The best part is that the sauce is completely loaded with garlic! If you love garlic, you have to try this! I'm sad that I won't be close to this place anymore since I'm transplanting from Tempe to Phoenix, but when I do head down that direction, I'll definitely hit up Wong's if I have a hankering for Chinese (it totally trumps any other Chinese restaurant in the area). 

Oh, and one last thing...go with the blue menu!"}
{"text":"In Tempe visiting my son...had a taste for some Good Chinese Food...found this place..and had a very Enjoyable Dinner food was Great and Service was Excellent"}
{"text":"Phoenix is not the place to find good Chinese food.  However, Wong's has some of the best in the area.  Their prices are reasonable and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Food was horrible for all 4 guests in our party.  Everything was served cold and had clearly been reheated. Not even remotely fresh. The owner was at the door and seated us without so much as a word and checked us out without a word or even a smile. Server did not listen to anything we said as we ordered and seemed irritated. On top of the less than stellar food and service, the restaurant was dirty with stains all over booth and carpet. I love to support small businesses but this was a really bad meal."}
{"text":"I love Wong's Place. I always have. How I never wrote a review about it before, I have no idea! I've been going here for around 10 years and have never been disappointed. Despite living in South Phoenix, I still make a point to come to Tempe from time to time just to visit Wong's Place. It's well worth the drive.

As to what to eat here, well... everything! My personal favorites are the Wong Jo and House Special chicken dishes, but I've had nearly everything on the menu and loved all of it.

Also, like Nader said, get the blue menu!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for take-out.  The dining area isn't the fanciest, but the food is great."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Its kinda a hole in the wall, but the food is spot on. Service is so-so, but you look past it when you start eating. First Chinese place we love since moving to the state. We have tried a ot too!!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Sacramento and would come home to visit family in Tempe.  At the time this was the only \"chinese\" restaurant (1990's).  My family would drag me here and I would be aghast at the small portions and steep prices (chow mein for $8-10?) and the portions were about 2/3rds the size of what I would get for $6.  Ignorance is bliss and when there's no competition, they can do this kind of stuff.

Thankfully, there about 10 chinese restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place and no one I know even comes near this place.

So if it's high prices and diet-sized portions you're looking for, then have at it.

What cracks me up is that the top 5 restaurants (according to many of the local chinese) are either not even on yelp or have only a few reviews.

The best \"yelpers\" are the word-of-mouthers.  if it's good it spreads throughout the chinese community like wild fire.  And if it's bad, it spreads faster than a ladies sewing club....(i made that one up)

I would recommend these places if you want the real deal (in no particular order)

1) Asian Cafe Express
2) New Hong Kong
3) Tao Garden
4) Asian Hong Kong Diner
5) Great Wall
6) China King

just ask the locals who grew up here"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Wong's. This was our first tine here and are hooked. The food is cooked too order and was super fresh. For $34 we had four egg rolls, Wong jo chicken, Mongolian beef, and house deluxe fried rice. What a steal for a dinner for two! Definitely repeat customers."}
{"text":"Spent time visiting an artist friends studio in Tempe on Saturday. We decided to get a bite to eat and drove to Wong's Place.  I've been here 6 or 7 times in the last 2 years and have always had a good meal.  I had the kung pao chicken lunch special for $5.95, which included a decent hot and sour soup, fried rice, crab puffs and hot green tea.  The service was attentive and I never went without an ice cold glass of water.  The chicken was spiced well and was tasty, not too spice, just right for me."}
{"text":"I tried Wong's for the first time and I can say I definitely say I will not go back.  We ordered our food for take out and I ordered the almond chicken dinner special.The meal also came with wonton soup, fried wonton, eggroll, and we ordered a side of crab puffs.

The almond chicken was disappointing there wasn't much chicken in there, the zucchini and mushrooms were plentiful in the meal. I was a little confused by the addition of peas in the medley. I expected there to be slivered almonds mixed in with the dish. However I received cut up almonds that looked like the kind you buy for baking just dumped on the top of the dish.  

The fried wonton and eggroll were ok. What you would typically expect to get from  a Chinese restaurant. The wonton tasted overcooked, I had to dip it in the soup to make it edible. The Crab puff had barely any filling in the puff it was almost completely flat, very disappointing.  The one saving grace was the wonton soup. The soup is the only thing I would ever eat from that place again and I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali, so when I say its good, its good! I'm writing a review because I was hungry and in search of somewhere to go and realized I never wrote anything for Wong's Place....so here I am, writing away. *stomach growling* I think I know what my body is telling me....\"yes body, lets go get some Wong's!\""}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese spots in the valley. This is one of those places that no matter the distance you go to just because its that good. What we order EVER SINGLE TIME: Egg drop soup for me and seafood tofu soup for the hubby and for Entree we both order the Salt and pepper pork (served over steamed rice and topped with fresh jalapeño slices, cilantro and garlic chili sauce) YUM YUM YUM, need I say more?"}
{"text":"While I may not be the best person to rate the restaurant, I am writing a review for myself so I know if I want to return when I come back to AZ again.

Compared to the Chinese food I've had in NY, Chicago, LA, Vancouver, SD, this place is just so-so.  Compared to fast food Chinese you find at the mall, it's definitely a gem.  

We had the dumpling soup (base was blah- soysauce based with little flavor, and adding spicy sauce didn't help), soup dumplings however, looked home made and were nice), fried dumplings (pan fried, not fried, only 2 sides were fried), beef chow fun (good, beef was a bit saucy which is not how I normally have it), Mongolian beef (best thing we ordered), beef & Broccoli (just OK), short rib (now my friend said it was like Korean BBQ-- I was laughing inside. The meat is cut strange, little triangle on the bone, and the flavor is sooo different than Korean BBQ, it's almost insulting. also, just an OK dish), and pan fried noodles (seemed like thinner noodles, the chow mein noodles were weak).  

I don't doubt that this is the best Chinese in Phoenix (friends at the cooking school in town atest to this fact), however, there is so much more out there in the US.

Service was good, place was clean.  Big tables for families (10 people) and booths for cozy groups."}
{"text":"Some of the nicest friendliest people you'll ever meet if you want chicken wings they had the best it's a little different style that you used to but damn good if you want Chinese order the house deluxe chow mein or Wong Jo chicken two of  my favorite dishes love this place"}
{"text":"After reading reviews that \"this is the best chinese food in the valley!\" my boyfriend and I decided to get some takeout tonight from them.  Their website doesn't have a menu, so I sent the boy away with orders to get me a garlic chicken dish.

I want to give this a single star, however my bf claims his food was better than mine so I'll up it to a two.  Mine was plain terrible.  I have had far better, and in fact had to add some black bean sauce from my fridge to add some flavor to it.  Literally no flavor OR spice in fact.  Ben got chicken fried rice, and the pan fried shrimp.  He said the fried rice was terrible, shrimp was average.  Steamed rice was kinda crunchy, just your average quick cook rice.

Now we are used to east coast takeout, so maybe we've been spoiled but I certainly won't be eating here again.  Bummer because I was really hoping to find a kick ass chinese take-out place close to home.  The search goes on..."}
{"text":"When you walk in and see the 80s decor don't let that sway your opinion. I've been here several times since Wong's is close to my house.  The service is always great plus the food is really good and consistent. I've had orange chicken, hunan, szechuan, chow mein all with shrimp, beef, or chicken. I would recommend the szechuan beef out of all the dishes I've tried so far. Although they have all been full of flavor with large portions and plenty of veggies not just a plain plate of meat."}
{"text":"We were heading to a DBacks game and wanted some great Chinese. We took a chance on Wong's!  

This place was the best hole in the wall we've ever been to. It's not in the best part of town, but it stands erect and proud so it's easily recognized. The back of the building, which is attached living quarters, suggests the structure could crumble under its own weight at any moment. The inside is dusty and lining one of the walls you'll find cases and cases of soda. There are outlets and fans that could use some attention along with typical decor. 

However dodgy this place looks, it makes up for it in attitude and flavor! The waitress was sweet and always smiling. We ordered Wong's Vegetarian Delight, Vegetarian Bean Curd Soup and Vegetarian Lo Mein. Each dish was cooked to perfection and flavor danced on my taste buds. Hands down, this was the best Chinese food We've had in Phoenix yet. And, looking back, I wouldn't change a thing about the place. It's got chicken wire on the windows, but it just adds to the character of the experience. 

So, it's a must go. We will be back."}
{"text":"I noticed Wong's ratings trend has dropped recently but I can testify that they have shot right back up!  We ate here this Friday evening and had fabulous food.  My son had Beef with black bean sauce, the wife had House Special Chicken, crunchy on the outside, tender and moist breast inside. Deep fried chicken breast with orange peel sauce & water chestnuts, intense delightful flavor with just the right amount of kick, very similar to General Tso's chicken.  I ordered Szechuan Egg Plant with pork, the great flavor of perfectly cooked eggplant with tons of pork in a delicate but spicy sauce.  I don't know when I last had more flavorful, rich and tasty dishes.  Three for three, that's perfection.  Abundant portions and a spice level I enjoyed.  The service was great, the restaurant clean and the prices moderate.  I'm a fan and will definitely return many more times."}
{"text":"I really just wanted Chinese food. Not the healthy Thai or Vietnamese food or the other pan-Asian establishments that are all about healthy cooking. I wanted the grease-and I wanted it now!

Located really close to Mr. Mustachios abode, we drove over there and I noted the favorably reviewed Yelp sticker on their door. the decor is very Golden Girls-mauve, mauve, floral pattern, and more MAUVE. The menu was pretty extensive, but when I saw I could have nothing vegetarian on their appetizer menu, I knew it could end up being a Tums night so I didn't give birth to a food baby in the early morn-translation-almost all was gonna have meat in it, even if they took it out.

I got the eggplant with red tofu sauce (sans pork) with white rice and he got the old reliable Beef with Broccoli. I wasn't grossed out, the eggplant was tender, there was def. bits of pork (not huge, but there) and the rice was fine. The tea was fine, the booth didn't give swamp ass and the service was attentive.

So Wongs didn't blow my mind, but it blow my behind either. We left sated, had enough for leftovers and it cost under 20 bucks, and my Chinese food craving was handled swiftly.

Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased but this place is just okay.  The noodles are greasy, the entrees are greasy, the rice is a little on the hard side.  When I need a quick Chinese food fix that is more authentic than Pei Wei and Panda Express, I come here -- but it's just MARGINALLY better.  I think if the cooks erred more on the side of cooking authentically Chinese style the dishes would be much better."}
{"text":"When I walked into this place, my first thought was of how dirty looking rhe place was. But I told myself not to judge based off of the appearance of the place. So I was seated. The owner immediately brought out a cup of water and hot tea with a menu. He came back a few minutes later took my order, which was shrimp chop suey. A few minutes later I got my soup, some of the best egg drop soup I have ever had. My food came out., I wasn't expecting to have a chicken wing with my food but it was amazing. The entree of course was even better. Huge portion for a very reasonable price. I was amazed by the taste of the food and I definitely will come back whenever I am in the area. I'm usually picky about where I go to eat, so thank you yelp and all previous reviews of this restaurant, you all led me to an incredible place. :)"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday with a co-worker.  Service was ok.  The place is kinda old and ratty, but that didn't bother me.  I ordered the chicken chow mein, it was tasty, good flavor, lots of chicken.  The hot and sour soup was wierd and way too thick and gloppy for my taste.  Too much corn starch I guess.  The meal came with soup, a wonton and a chicken wing, the wing was good, I didnt eat the won ton because I had just gotten new hardware on my braces and could barely eat 5 bites... but what I could eat was pretty good.  My son ate the left overs ALL GONE.  I'll have to go back and take the family :o)"}
{"text":"My friends have always raved about this place for years and I finally broke down and decided to try it and I was pleasantly surprised. I love Chinese food and this place was good. When I got there they set me down and I was immediately served with tea and water(the tea was great BTW) and I ordered one of the lunch specials for only $6 bucks or something. The food was good and the portions were just right for lunch, was hooked until...I went back the next week to get my usual meal and as I was eating I saw a roach crawl on the wall!!! I told the waiter and he said that they spray regularly and offered to move me to another table...at this point I could have left but loving their food as much as I do I just moved to another table and finished my delicious food. I admit I have not been back there since but the food is good! I guess that's the risk you take for cheap Chinese food in Tempe.(they did give me 10% off the meal)"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and authentic. My favorites are the salt & pepper shrimp, and of course the seafood tofu soup. The owner Henry is very nice and his team provide great customer service. Wong's is a small hole in the wall restaurant worth checking out."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is so hard to find in this part of the country that I'm surprised this place only gets 3.5 stars from reviewers. I'm not going to recommend any one dish but Wong's is the closest thing I've experienced to Chinese food in the Northeast (think Seinfeld minus the deliveries). Prices are reasonable and there are even two different menus, one being an authentic Chinese one. I had a server who completely didn't understand me, which is why I left off a fifth star. He wasn't Chinese either. There is no decor in this place whatsoever so you know the main focus is the food. It even feels like a NY sit down Chinese restaurant. From what I'm told it's been around a while too, well worth checking out."}
{"text":"BEST Chinese food in this valley!  We love the food, and the service is attentive without hovering.

If you are looking for decor, go someplace else.  this ain't it.  Wong's Place is a simple hole-in-the-wall kinda restaurant. 

On the other hand, if you want good food, this IS it!   Wong's Place just happens to serve amazingly good food -- consistently!

Most times I go to Wong's Place, I'm one of very few (sometimes the only) Caucasian(s) in the place.  Almost all the customers Are Asian.  When the people of an ethnic group eat their ethnic food in an ethnic restaurant, that's a *very* good sign!

My friend, who lives near 23rd Ave. & Northern in Phoenix (a mere 22 miles away), goes ONLY to Wong's Place when in the mood for Chinese food.  Wong's Place is the also only Chinese restaurant that I go to in the Valley.

Lunch specials are inexpensive, and there's enough to take some home.

Go. Relax.  Eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley by far...that is, if you like authenticChinese food.

Having lived in the South Bay Area and Los Angeles, I'm accustomed to hole-in-the-wall restaurants that offer authentic ethnic dishes... Wong's place is one of those establishments. Not only is the food great, but the price is just right also. And to complete the trifecta, the service will exceed your expectations. 

I recommend the sizzling rice soup for starters while garlic fried chicken or Hong Kong shrimp as a main dish."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. I'd have given them 2 stars, but when I went there last week, I wanted to gouge my eyes out with used tampons from sheer frustration...This time was a big, huge MISS.

I hadn't been there in over six months and it slipped my mind that they have the two separate menus -- the non-asian menu (pink) and the asian menu (blue). When the pink menus were dropped on me, I wondered where the chicken chow fun had disappeared to - oh....that's right, I must have appeared as an americanized asian. MY BAD.

I asked for the blue menu and was given a funky look, but it was brought and slapped down on the table with more force than necessary. Was that needed? Really? I thought it was me. Maybe it was. *shrugs*

I honestly thought I'd get a different item on the menu, but noooo...I went for the chicken chow fun.

What a hot mess that was. Not in a good way. It was mega greasy. I mean GREASY like I could've oiled all the squeaky doors I've ever heard in my entire life. There was no flavor. None.

My friend was horrified with her yang chow fried rice. She didn't know what to make of it. I felt bad for recommending it. It was such a let down.

Best chinese food in Mesa/Phoenix? Really? You think so? I don't think so.

I think I'll take my chances with that hideous KFC further down the street than eat here ever again. Hell, I'll go eat at Golden Palace - you know, the place with no windows? - before I'll ever eat at Wong's Place.

Oh...and to add insult to injury, service was so bad (food was slapped down on the table so hard noodles fell off the plate! I only got ONE glass of water as did my friend; they looked at me like I had NO RIGHT using chopsticks when I asked for them, etc) I didn't leave a tip...and the server chased after me as I was getting into my car, demanding tip money. I said no and drove off. I hope he doesn't realize I literally live around the corner from this place...

What drama was had to be all around at Wong's Place. 

Maybe I caught them at a wong time. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck..."}
{"text":"Love this food for it's family friendly atmosphere and the tasty food.  The garlic chicken and garlic fried rice are our favorites!"}
{"text":"I have tried looking for the BEST Chinese Food Restaurant in Phoenix or anywhere that is close to where we live and then I stumbled upon Wong's Place. This was the only business with a rating over 3 and a half stars. Compared to the other reviews, this was the BEST choice. So, once day, my Hubbie & I drove out to Tempe to try this place. When it comes to Chinese Food, I will always order Chow Mein & Kung Pao Chicken, but here... we order so much more.

The food is AMAZING. Everything has its own unique flavors, the beef is amazingly tender in the Beef with Broccoli dish. & I am no fan of broccoli but when I am here, I eat it ALL. My Hubbie & I share two entrees, the Beef with Broccoli and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao is the BEST dish I have had YET. I went from Panda Express to many other places, in search of the most Authentic Chinese Food out in Phoenix, and I have found it.

The employees are nice and very fast. We usually start with the Crab Puffs and within 10 minutes, our entrees are ready. And when we have leftovers, the server packages everything up for you, including the white rice. They serve hot tea with each meal, as well as iced water. It's usually is a quite place, and best part, they deliver!! Unfortunately, not in the Phoenix area...

My Hubbie & I go here for ANY and ALL celebrations. I can honestly say, this is MY favorite restaurant to go to in AZ!!"}
{"text":"I love the Chinese menu. They make the BEST shrimp with scrambled eggs.  It's the best in the area.  They really need to do a good cleaning of the chairs, walls, windows.  The food is outstanding though."}
{"text":"Pretty good - it's cheap...it's close...and they have some good chinese food for the area. They don't deliver though."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced.  Great value.  Yummy!!!! The biggest surprise was the Diet Plate---it was steamed shrimp, white meat chicken, tofu, napa cabbage and some other vegetables with steamed rice.   There was no sauce but it was all very fresh and refreshing considering how heavy Chinese food can be. Egg drop soup had vegetables and wasn't too salty--also very rare (soups are always super salty, no?).  We had the Kung Pao chicken which was also good.  Can't go wrong here.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch on a friend's recommendation and should have walked out after seeing the dingy interior. I sat down and was presented with hot tea, which was nice, and decided on the moo shi (not shoo) pork lunch special. The egg drop soup was good but the moo shi pork was saltier than usual. The worst part of the meal, warranting 2 stars, was the rice. I asked the waiter what kind of rice it was a he had no idea; the rice is brown but not brown rice, it also doesn't taste like fried rice, I venture to guess it's leftover Rice A Roni. I guess I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wong's is THE best place for lunch!  Their specials are the best in the Valley!  Large portions, soup, chicken wing, crab puff, AND soup!  The owner is always on site and helping.  Staff is super friendly!  We LOVE Wong's! :)"}
{"text":"A Tempe staple for over 20 years.  One of the many places to eat in the valley I have missed since moving to SoCal.

Ask for the second menu, and order the Walnut Shrimp."}
{"text":"Been coming here with my family since I was a kid and nothing's changed- the food is so good! The service is great also. I love Frank and Simon- the servers. My favorites are the seafood tofu soup, garlic fried chicken, salty fish fried rice, salt and pepper pork and the steamed sea bass! Best Chinese food in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST Chinese food in Arizona and I've been going since 1994! As a regular, everything on the menu is fantastic. But we always order fried tofu with special sauce (delicious silken tofu with an extremely light batter and a sweet/spicy dipping sauce), steamed fish, sauteed snow pea leaves, salt and pepper pan fried shrimp. After the meal, they always serve a refreshing and quite frankly the best tasting almond jello ever. The lunch specials are cheap and Americanized, but the sauces are flavorful. The wait staff are friendly and awesome. I've introduced one and all my friends to this fantastic place. It's the perfect place for family style meals. However, if you're not Asian, you will probably get the pink menu. The blue menu has more authentic dishes which you should try. After I told this to my manager, he tried to get the blue menu without me there, but was denied. Always persist because it will be worth it!

Now, if Wong's could make it to San Francisco...I would be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Easily our Friday night family spot.. it is not fancy, it's not glamorous but the food is good and with good portions."}
{"text":"Good service and good food.

Nice people.

I ordered Wong Jos Chicken. It's similar to general tzo chicken. The sauce was amazing. The chicken was all white meat and easy to identify as chicken, which is a plus. 

Hot and sour soup was just like everyone else's. 

He lunch special came with a chicken wing, fried cream cheese  wonton and some other magical treat. 

I would recommend."}
{"text":"I won't recommend it. The food is very oily. No wonder people will think Chinese food is very unhealthy. The service is good though. The staff is very friendly and checking on u very often. Two stars is for the service. The food is really bad."}
{"text":"Wong's has been a family favorite for years! The service is exceptional, you always have a fresh pot of hot tea, and two menus for different tastes! There is a big round table for family functions that spins so everyone can spin the table to teach their favorites! I love Wong's!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this restaurant for about 15 years, and have never been disappointed with a meal.   I like the mixed vegetables and the broccoli with mushrooms in oyster sauce.  They will add tofu without charging extra.  Of all the different people that have eaten here with me, only one person didn't like the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, my family and I have been coming here for 10+ years and never have I once been disappointed with the food. The salt and pepper pork is something that I get every time.

Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place is our family outing restaurant.  The kids sip on the tea and we just sit and talk.

We've tried almost everything and flavors are reasonable.  Chef's Special Killer Shrimp is the best of all times.  It's a spicy, garlic, red soup with big shrimp.  We usually pour some over the white rice, but I like to sip on the broth!    The beef noodles have a good salty taste, once we tried the shrimp with mango on the chef's special board and I will not try it again."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been coming to Wong's Place for a number of years now. I found this little gem when I was wandering about Tempe (No I am not homeless, nor do I wander off when I drink) ;)

Anyhow, the majority of the time that I order the food to go, it is really good. I have had only a few issues with the rice for the sizzling rice soup being overcooked but I will say that the soup is awesome and tastes awesome (Three flavor). Wong-Jo chicken is good with egg fried rice, egg foo yung, house deluxe chow mein, imprerial three delights, mongolian beef (not a huge portion, but tasty), and random other tastyness!! 

They have not updated the decor and everytime that I come in to get my order, I converse with the guy that always takes my order. He is not The Mr. Wong, but he is like his right hand man. He recently told me that they have not fired any of their workers because everyone has been working there for over 10 years. Even in this economy when business is OK at best, they take care of their people. 
I hope this place never closes down or I will be sad for them, and hard pressed to find anyone who can mirror the sizzling rice soup and wong-jo chicken. 

It is a typical chinese restaurant but I think the food is better than most chinese knock-off restaurants. I think that if you can enjoy the authentic atmosphere and the food (pink menu if you are scared of authentic chinese), then you should be satisfied with your meal. Personally, I get mine to go 99% of the time because I will take it home and not feel bad when I load my plate up with everything and go back for seconds!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for traditional egg drop soup, do NOT go here. I would have never expected to have to ask whether or not there was meat in their egg drop soup as I have never ever seen it made with pieces of meat in it. They apparently make it with big chunks of chicken. Giving a \"neutral\" review since I couldn't eat anything I ordered and will be eating $1 top ramen instead for dinner."}
{"text":"Always my go to for Chinese. And Mr. Wong is so sweet. Dependable and delicious. Deluxe House Chow Mien is great!"}
{"text":"FOOD

I had the won ton soup and crab puffs.  Hadn't had won ton soup in a long time but glad I did because it was excellent.  The crab puffs were good, but were a bit flat as if something had been set on top of them so the presentation could have been better.

SERVICE

The service was perfectly adequate and the food arrived promptly.

ATMOSPHERE

Pretty standard Chinese restaurant surroundings. Wong's is not the coziest of restaurant environs but neither is it overly sterile."}
{"text":"Definitly the best Chinese food in the valley, or at least the best ive tried. This place is nothing amazing, but its the only Chinese restaurant in arizona where i wont complain about my meal. The wonton soup is reallllll good here."}
{"text":"Living in the Valley of the Sun, the Asian population is not concentrated while spread out throughout the valley, so getting really good authentic Chinese food is a challenge.  Long ago, I think Wong's was owned by, run by and the cooks were all Chinese.

We haven't been to Wong's in years and now I realize why.  The owner is still Chinese, but the servers/waiters and cooks are all Mexican.  The food didn't taste too bad, and was okay, but on the level of Panda Express.  We like Panda Express, but the food was pricey for being on the level of Panda Express.

The Mexicans that served us were nice.  Nothing wrong with their service and they did everything they could to accommodate us.  We went with my mom who generously treated us.  But, my mom is very discriminatory and you could see the sour look on her Chinese face as she really didn't want to eat Chinese food made by Mexicans.

My Colombian husband (I asked him) asked the waiter who was cooking the food in Spanish.  The guy said Mexicans.  That greatly displeased my mom and nothing could make her happy.  Throughout the time, she made all sorts of rude comments to no fault of the Mexican waiters/servers.  Even though they said they were taught how to properly cook the food, it still didn't taste authentic enough.  

However, if you like more Americanized Chinese food, the food is perfectly fine.  I do think that $7.75 for 6 potstickers is a bit on the pricey side, though.  Most of the dishes were starting at $8 going up, which I think is a little pricey for not authentic Chinese.

The menu said Sea Bass is seasonal, but it is not a seasonal fish, so I'm not sure what that meant, other than we can charge you whatever we feel like.

The only part of service that wasn't too good was the Chinese owner.  He never smiled or acknowledged us until my mom went to pay.  He did say thank you to her, but he never looked at her in the eyes.

My mom commented that if you want authentic Chinese, it must be made my Chinese cooks.  If you want really good Mexican food, you want Mexicans who know what they're doing cooking your food.  I don't know, maybe that's old school and I don't know that I totally agree with that, but authentic Chinese doesn't taste like Panda Express.

Anyway, my mom complained throughout dinner, nitpicking.  The food was alright.  Nothing great, nothing bad.  Service was good.  

So, if you have an old schooled Chinese mom or dad, you really don't want to take them to this place.  If you have some white friends who have not a clue authentic Chinese, this might be okay.  However, I think the owner should greet his customers instead of looking at them with disdane.

Sometimes Asians can be quite difficult to please.  My mom would probably give a 1 star, but I'm feeling generous tonight."}
{"text":"The consensus between me, my friend, and my sister is that Wong's Place IS the best Chinese Szechaun / Hunan restaurant in the Phoenix Area! My friend could not stop eating! Could it be that he wasn't paying for it? The first two days I was here I ate half of his dishes from China Chili and Mediterranean House. No weird, funny faces today!

What we ordered...

Salty Fish Fried Rice - Do NOT order this unless you know what you're getting into... This Fried Rice is made with salted preserved dried fish, cut up into little pieces, also cooked with pieces of chicken. Most non-Orientals would exclaim who's got BO! I've just warned you! My friend had not had this dish in years... loved it.

Pan Fried Shrimp - Whole Shrimp is fried WITH the skin... You will see the shrimp staring right back at you with it's beady black eyeballs! How to eat - Break off shrimp at neck and eat the body and tail... Even the skin is edible! Chomp on the shrimp's head at your own risk! The shrimp is served with thin slices of Jalapeno on a bed of lettuce. The Jalapeno gives it a nice hot flavor!

Szechuan Green Beans - This turned out to be sweeter than Wong's usually makes it. Think it was contaminated from another table's order... But still VERY GOOD!

Black Pepper Sizzling with Black Bean Sauce - Black Bean Sauce is used in Chinese dishes as a salt alternative. But it is VERY tasty to Chinese. No chemically tenderized meat here!

A dessert of Cocanut Milk Jello, a dessert I've never seen at any other Chinese restaurant, comes with your meal...  FREE!

I had not been here at Wong's Place in years.. Has not changed one bit... Still one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix Area..."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here as long as I can remember. This is the freshest tastiest Chinese food I've ever had. The staff is super competent and the food is always fast and hot. Hunan chicken, Wong Jo chicken, sizzling rice soup, beef with broccoli, Mongolian beef, but most importantly, IMPERIAL THREE DELIGHTS SPICY. Used to be tom running the show but now it's Henry, he has even brought the food to my car when picking up with the kids. They have never gotten an order wrong and I have never had a bad meal. Wongs is a staple in our family. 

Lunch special is amazing too. Cheap, tons of delicious food. It got me through college while at ASU. I LOVE WONGS!"}
{"text":"Here is my opinion about this place in a nutshell after coming to this place for 12 years:

1)Con's: The décor and the inside is a HOT MESS.  I would not recommend dining in. The floors are dirty and the décor is OLDDDDD, period end of story.  It wasn't always this way. The owner's children used to be more involved--maybe they moved away. I could never see myself dining in here anymore -- sad face. It is basically become your \"hole in the wall\" Chinese joint with tables, chairs and waiters.  My recommendation: Get your food and bounce!

2)For Phoenix standards in the East Valley (I can't speak on other parts of the valley), this is the best darn Chinese food going.  Can't speak on soup/fortune cookies, etc. and other things but the actual food is the best thing going as far I'm concerned.  It's hot, tasty, packaged well with good portion sizes.  I usually get chicken with broccoli, lo mein, chicken wings -- those are my staple items that I typically order.  I have never been disappointed with the food.  Now this place DOES NOT have a D rating so I can only assume, the kitchen isn't a hot mess, so I'm good."}
{"text":"Love love Wongs!! An institution for years! staff is friendly and remembers you if you frequent.......

If you didn't like your food then you didn't know what to order....try the house pan fried noodles, salt & pepper pork, empress ribs and sizzling short ribs.....yummo!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, especially their short rib sizzling. They have good customer service too. Everyone in this store extremely nice and know what they are doing. I would definitely come back this place for dinner and lunch"}
{"text":"The entrees here are hit and miss.  The first time I got food to go, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of the dishes.  I'm a blue menu type of gal, and my favorite was the Won Ton soup.  They add in sesame seed to the mixed dumpling meat to give it an extra depth of flavor and texture, and the clear broth is very tasty and perfect for a cold winter night.  The second time I ordered from here, the dishes were just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken with bok choy was a bit bland, and they did not wash the bok choy enough because the dish tasted gritty and there was still sand in the leaves.  The Singapore rice noodles were also a bit bland and not spicy at all."}
{"text":"The best best Chinese food in Arizona hands down. The sizzling rice soup is amazing. The family meal deals are the best, you get the great soup, appetizers and everyone gets to choose an entrée for a reasonable price. This place is as authentic as American Chinese food can get! 
The moo shu pork is delicious and so is their Kung pao!"}
{"text":"i remember eating at Wongs place since i was a kid. still a place i eat at now. food is amazing. recommend getting fish fried rice. salt pepper pork. and sea bass. ate here the last few Sundays and it never disappoints. craving it now. most likely will eat here this Sunday"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me one day taking me out to Chinese food Whe nwe arrived I was like what the heck is this place. I have lived in Tempe my whole life and never knew about this place..It has 80's decor`e but thats a given for a restaurant that has been there over 22 years who just wants to serve yummy food. Although when I am there I want to redecorate for them so so bad. BUT HANDS DOWN ITS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD AROUND...They are so friendly and attentive to your needs. Everything is good that I have ordered so far. Just writing this review makes me want to go there right now.. IT'S A MUST TRY"}
{"text":"I ordered once months ago and I loved the food. I have twice in the last couple months submitted orders on grubhb and both times an hour after ordering got a call from grubhub telling me the order was cancelled.   WTF!!!! Why take orders only to cancel. I'm so mad I can't put it into words. What a lousy way to handle paying customers!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for the last 16 yrs. their salt and pepper pork is one of their best dishes! Best Chinese food ever!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for a few reasons. First to note, is they serve you hot Jasmine tea right when you sit down. Tea to talk over is fabulous when you're waiting for your meal to be prepared. The pot stickers are my favorite- the meat is well seasoned and the dumpling flour is perfectly chewy. Their won-ton soup is possibly the best in town! I recently tried their Lobster Sauce Shrimp (comes with white rice), and it was amazing. The shrimp were GIANT sized, and tasted perfectly fresh which is odd for being in the desert!"}
{"text":"A little greasy, but as truly good Chinese is difficult to find in the Valley, you can't go too terribly wrong here."}
{"text":"Wong's is a total hole in the wall, but is great. Everything I've had at Wong's has been delicious. All the dishes have good flavor and nice portion sizes. My favorite is the Mongolian beef."}
{"text":"Wong's Place is easily my favorite Chinese in the Valley. The owners are such gracious hosts, and the food is absolutely delicious! I usually get the salt and pepper pork and the Mongolian beef, but have sampled other menu items all of which have exceeded my expectations. Definitely a place to try out, you'll end up coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Yes, this place is a little rough around the edges, but when ti comes to Canto-style/Hong Kong cooking, this place does a pretty good job.  I would even admit to trying their Chinese-American dishes and being pleasantly surprised.

Lunch specials here are priced right but nothing special about the food, mostly Chinese-American stuff but they do it just fine.

One of my best memories was coming here for the New Year (Western) with a group of about 8 friends.  We asked for a banquet-style meal and they hooked us up.  Salt and pepper pork, fried shrimp, crispy Hong Kong noodles, etc.  It was an amazing value for the quantity and quality of the food that we got.  

 I've said this before in a review.  You are an adult.  You won't die if you eat it.  Order off the Chinese menu.  It not only tastes better, but is more likely better for you.  Stick to the authentic stuff and your taste buds will thank you.  And don't be scared of the interior.  Or some of the scary customers from the bar next door."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. I make it a point to come here every time I visit Phoenix 3-4 times a year. It is authentic and I love it. There is a menu in Chinese also, which offers even more variety if you ask for a translation. It's a small business, and they really go out of their way to please. Try it."}
{"text":"Wong's Place is a staple, a standby, the place I go for Chinese food, both for dine-in and take-out.  

The Moo Shoo pork is a highlight, as are the crab puffs."}
{"text":"Wanted to try another locally owned place in my neighborhood and I see this place every time I leave Target across the street!!! Todays urge on my mind was soup and this place didn't disappoint. Checked out the reviews from Yelp and lots of positives. Don't let the exterior or location fool you... Had 2 soups and the house chicken... It was served hot and prompt and exceeded my expectations... In short, I'm coming back as the soups looked amazing on other tables and from the menu!"}
{"text":"My regular Togo place when I feel lazy at home, the food is great but make sure u check the order before u take it back home especially the busy hour! ;( they miss one of my main course n I need to go back n get it@@ no my idea lazy Togo day, I guess .."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worse Chinese food I have had. Ordered the house chicken since it seemed to be a favorite by the reviews. The sauce came in a to go box which was leaking all over the place. The chicken was plain and sauce tasted like sweet burnt garbage. Ate maybe five bites then threw the rest out. Don't bother with this place, I'd rather eat at Panda"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in the valley. When I used to live right next to this place my roommates and I would get takeout at least once  week. Obviously its not as good as San Fran or some other large cities I have been too, but this is Phoenix for crying out loud. So when it comes to Chinese, Wongs place is the only place I like to go."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on the wong day?  I went to Wong's Chinese for the lunch special.  There was only one other couple inside which seemed awkward for the lunch hour?  I ordered the 'House Special Chicken' and although the first few bites were tasty, it had a pungent scent to it that eventually turned me off.  I asked if soda pop were available, but was told that the soda machine hadn't been working for 'a couple weeks'?  A couple weeks?  So, I'm the only person in two weeks to have walked in an asked for soda?  Again, very awkward.  The lunch was reasonably priced, however, I don't think I would return for smelly chicken and no soda."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.  The food is ALWAYS great and I agree that the service is great without hovering.  Their lunch menu is the best value as well as the best chinese food in town"}
{"text":"Wong's is my favorite place for Chinese.  Just about everything is good!  Wong Jo's chicken is spicy and good, the House Special Sizzling Rice Soup is outstanding, as is the  House Special Fried Rice. The Pork Egg Fu Yong is really good too!   Almost all the menu items are good.  They give you A LOT of food.  The person who said the portions are skimpy must over eat.  I consistently take home food for lunch the next day.   

The comments about the interior being nothing special is true!  It is a hole in the wall joint that could use a makeover. But that would be the interior and not the help or the food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Wong's for almost 20 years and the place looks the same. I really wish they were able to do a little updating. I'm sure the physical appearance of the place turns some people off... which is a shame, because their food is SO LEGIT.

For the first time ever, I tried the friend chicken (half) with garlic sauce... while the chicken was a tad overcooked, it was very, VERY good! The garlic sauce... I'm dreaming about it now. So sweet and salty! You could smear it on a shoe and I'd eat it!

Anyway - if you're looking for amazing Chinese food, give Wong's a try... look beyond the 1990 decor and trust me on this.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Not sure where the great  reviews are coming from. The food is basically flavor less and the meat quality is sub par. The decor is old fashioned but I was here for the food. The service is good 5 stars for that. For those giving this place 5stars should try the fried rice. If you are going to write a review of a chinese food place. You should know Chinese food first"}
{"text":"I love their food, period!  I've been to this place for many times(whenever I'm in Arizona) and I always received the excellent food & the service :). I think there are couple of servers working at Wong's for a long time and I noticed that they are very royal to the customers.  My tea pot is always full and my water glass is refilled without asking.
To me, it is a comfortable family Chinese restaurant that you can go as a group of friends & family occasionally.  The interior decor isn't that  impressive or a style of up to date, but it is a clean restaurant that I can enjoy my tasty Chinese dishes any time at Wong's.  

Sizzling Rice Soup(must have item!!)
Mandarin Tofu(usually comes w/fried tofu but u can ask for reg tofu)
Beef w/Baby Boc Choy
Cristal Shrimp(if u r a mayo lover)
Fried Chicken w/Garlic sauce
FYI:  if you are in a special diet, you have no option of getting brown rice here :(

Well, I am definitely coming back to Wong's on my next weekend trip here in AZ :D"}
{"text":"had Wong's chicken and chicken lo mien.  The food was greasy. Wong's chicken was not crisp. The dumplings were under cooked. Terrible food"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get pan-fried noodles. Not sure about how fresh they are, though, as I have seen some jelly-like sauce before (as if they just freeze it and then cook it when ordered). The salt & pepper eggplant was delicious. Also, they have the best crab wontons--just cream cheese in the middle and no imitation crab. Very good taste, not sure how fresh everything is, and sometimes the plates & silverware aren't completely clean."}
{"text":"Had take-out from here tonight while visiting family in Tempe. It just wasn't anything to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor in the Kung Po Shrimp (though the shrimp itself was pretty good), and the Hunan beef left a weird filmy taste on my tongue. No dish was less than $10 either- not worth it at all. It definitely didn't make me want to go back for the dine-in experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Our dish was delicious, hot and fresh. We enjoyed it immensely. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is really good. But I really like the service, call for a take out order and it ready in like 10 min tops. Go in and order take out and the owner will go back and make it and have you out the door in less time than that."}
{"text":"One of my fav chinese spots in the valley!  This is one of those places where if you choose the right menu items it's super awesome but I think they got a few things they are not great at, like their kung pow.  I've been going here for years so here are some of my favorites:  Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, Salt Pepper Pork, Sizzling Beef Short Ribs, Garlic Friend Shrimp, Crystal Shrimp, Lemon Chicken, Wong Jo Chicken, Madarin Beef.  You'll find lots of local people here.  Lots of asians!  Good sign that the food is good right?"}
{"text":"This is pretty much our regular place for Chinese since we moved to Tempe. Food comes out super fast and as far as I can tell, it's cooked to order. It has been one of the most reliable and consistent restaurants we've ever been (numerous times). They've been here for decades, so they should have it down by now. 

Service has always been fast - we've sat down to eat, but usually we take it to go. When we dined in, service was attentive and good. The owner is usually who helps us, and he's super nice and fast - I don't think I've ever felt like I was \"waiting.\" 

The only real \"complaint\" one could lodge here is that the decor is a bit dated, but I don't come here to marvel at the wallpaper, I come to eat some amazing food. I'm too cowardly and set in my ways to order from the blue menu, and we pretty much always get the same things. We aren't terribly adventurous, but everything we've had has been fantastic. 

There are a lot of choices in this part of town for Chinese food, and I'd say that this is easily one of the best if not THE best."}
