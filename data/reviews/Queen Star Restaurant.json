{"text":"Seems kinda sketchy which might put some people off but the food here is great. And cheap! The portions are huge and you can easily feed two people for $15. Also, their onion rings are the best ever!"}
{"text":"There is a particular kind of person who will probably love the Queen Star.  But that person is not me.  It's basically a Chinese restaurant crossed with a greasy-spoon diner.  The menu has your standard Chinese food offerings plus diner breakfast and sandwiches.  Everything about this place seems sketchy and sloppy.  They were out of a lot of menu items, service was extremely slow/confused, and the food was a little gross.  The restaurant itself is shoddy and kind of dingy.    Yes, it's cheap, and yes, it's edible (more or less), but I really have no desire to go back, especially as an out-of-towner.  Connoisseurs of dives might appreciate it, though."}
{"text":"This place is really weird in regards to the menu, but I had an inexpensive breakfast here."}
{"text":"I might only like this place because I've loved it for so long (RIP Friendly's). Don't expect anything other than a cheap, big, greasy breakfast."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Need to get the greasy spoon fix sometimes. And they seem like nice folks and and like to support the local businesses that haven't fallen to gentrification. BUT it's grim lighting and downcast staff PLUS a half-hour wait for a subpar philly cheesesteak...yeah it's cheap but even if it were free it wouldn't be worth it. The local g spoon quest continues."}
{"text":"We came in after moving into the area when we saw an all day breakfast sign for $4.95.  It's a dingy diner but how can you go wrong getting 4 eggs, bacon, toast, coffee and home fries for $5?  There are various other items on the menu for $5 like a burger and fries or fried rice.  The food here is very solid for a diner and I'd come back in a heart beat when I'm hungry...especially if I didn't want to spend to much."}
{"text":"Food & cost is very decent, service usually very good.  I've been to Queen Star Restaurant several times for breakfast and once for a pad thai \"to go\".  The prices have always decent as has the food. However I've had some issues there with the service where I'd order something and not get it, yet they'd try to charge me for it in the end.  The last time I was there was last week-end, and I had excellent service along with great food, so based on my last experience, they deserve a top of the line rating. If this continues, I shalt update my rating for this venue to 5 stars :-D"}
{"text":"Love love love!!! This type of place I hope will last in the area. When what you need is a hunger fix and ginormous meal after a long night this is the ticket!   Typical greasy spoon with massive portions for a very affordable price. Food was delicious and hit the spot. No complaints."}
{"text":"Cheap, good breakfast. Atmosphere is a little rough around the edges but thats part of its charm. And the old server dude is funny!"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Queens West and I've been on the lookout for a place where the servings are large, the food is simple and you don't need to break a $10 note to eat there. This is that type of place.  Don't get me wrong. The food isnt amazing and its a real hole-in-the-wall but it's Queens West. There is plenty of \"samon topped grain fed\" creations if your looking for that. Good if you want it simple bacon and eggs and dont want to line up outside for a table."}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant got a four star review but when I went it was deplorable. My friend got a hair in his food and the burger I ordered was 2x smaller than the bun it was on and tasteless. Will be sure not to return in the future."}
{"text":"Just got mine delivered. It's delicious! I recommend the beef chop suey, spicy shanghai noodles with chicken and the pork fried rice. Just maybe don't get the general tso around dinner time because it seemed a little old as if it was under a heat lamp all day. Everything else has been super yummy.  4 items, huge portions, only $30. Great deal."}
{"text":"Awesome. Cheap. Food.   Amazing break fast and cheap Chinese food.  If you're in the Queen West area definitely try this gem if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"It took me sometime to realize the name of this restaurant because I just dashed into the big yellow token of a signage that said \"All day Breakfast\" and never bothered to read. My first thought is , what an ideal place?! two of my favourite foods - Chinese and breakfast food - but I am of course skeptical.  As with most places I love, the love for decor is non-existent - but I will take that trade off any day - good decor and bad food is sooo SO horrible, because they usually charge a lot too...ANYWAY.  Food is good; Cheap and nommy. I feel a bit ripped off when I buy the Chinese food here because in Chinatown, the same dish is slightly cheaper - but I am in Parkdale where we have slim pickings of ethnic foods. I don't expect service here -because it's a family run store and high school kids are usually serving away - but it's not bad. They're pleasant and bring me nommy foods for cheap- and usually are accommodating.  This is a great place to go when you're broke or too lazy to cook or both - take a handful of change and you can get a filling meal.   ONE beef I have: tiny milkshakes- slightly watery...but now I'm just being picky - and biased since in my world all milkshakes should come in supersized cups for $3."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasted OK, nothing special.  Waitress and cook can't speak English well enough to get any requests correct, wanted dark toast, got bread buttered, wanted mustard, had to get up and request it, eggs were scrambled rather than over easy .  But inexpensive and coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Gord and I had breakfast this morning at Queen Star Restaurant.  It's been a while since I've been there.  We both ordered four eggs with bacon.  It was a good hearty breakfast.  Our server was friendly and smiley."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night as I was craving greasy chinese food. I've walked pass this place about a dozen times and decided to try it out. Everything they made came from a freezer and was already pre made. I had the fried rice and it wasn't the best. The chicken was probably the worst. I don't think I'll ever come back again. If anything, I'd rather do the journey to Not Just Noodles on Yonge and Wellesley."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favourite place to eat in the area.  It reminds me of some of the old school diners I used to eat at growing up.  The food is good and the portions are big.  But, to top it off, the food is also unbelievably cheap.  They have a ton of options for only $5 bucks, including breakfast.    The breakfast itself is huge. Five bucks gets you coffee, home fries, toast, bacon, and FOUR eggs. How do they even make money for $5?  They have a huge ass cheeseburger with fries for five bucks as well.  The burger is bigger and tastier than the $17 burger at the Drake cafe, and their fries are also crispier and way better.  It really is a no brainer on where you should go if you want good food for cheap.    Their fried rice is also really huge and filling for $5.  I usually get stuck on the breakfast, but I am looking forward to trying every $5 item on the menu!"}
