{"text":"We just tried Trente Cinq this weekend.  With friends in town we thought this would be a fun, local restaurant to try. We love Belgium and thought this would be a unique and fun dinner experience. We must say our experience wasn't very good and we will not rush back.  We visited on a Saturday night and it was quite busy.  Service was very slow and frazzled.  We had to ask to be served after 20 minutes of sitting with menus.  They were out of all but 2 types of Belgian beer--we were so looking forward to a lambic but had to go without.  Fifteen minutes after placing our entree orders our server returned to inform us they had run out of mussels--their staple as it is in nearly half of their entrees and they were out.  We re-ordered, most of us switching from a mussel entree to waterzooi with mussels being replaced by other seafood options.  They did send out come fries at no charge right away (not as good as those we get in Belgium though) but we had to ask for our appetizers order 30 minutes earlier and the server seemed puzzled, inquiring if we still wanted them.  Puzzling service, indeed.  Of the appetizers we ordered (coquilles ostendaise, asperges ardennaise, and boulettes) the coquilles ostendaise (scallops) were the best. The asparagus was over cooked and disappointing while the meatballs were bland and dry though the sauce was good.  Entrees were very good.  Three of us tried the waterzooi while the others tried the steak au poivre and the pork dish, filet de porc.  We shared the dessert sampler which ended up being 3 one-inch diameter tarts-one chocolate, one custard topped with fruit and another I never quite knew.  Very disappointing for $10.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the prices are a bit high for what is served and the service received."}
{"text":"Trente-Cinq was such a surprisingly great experience. We had the Croquettes de crevettes for an appetizer which was nicely done (and more importantly not overdone). The two croquettes were a creamy and exceptionally good and these were served with a very light mixed green salad - the perfect dish to get your taste buds looking for more. Then came the entrees...we ordered the Steamed Mussels and Lamb Shank. The Steamed Mussels were by far the best tasting mussels I've ever had and the Lamb Shank was falling off the bone. When they brought the Steamed Mussels, they did not skimp on the portion size. This is an excellent dish to share with a group. The Lamb Shank melted in your mouth as was nicely served along with a vegetable ragout and couscous. The meal was perfect and they have a nice wine selection to accompany the meals quite well. The chef used to work at Coup De Tart in Phoenix, and I can certainly see why he started his own restaurant. Please check this restaurant out while you're in Phoenix, as Mr. Lionel Geuskens deserves the visitors with his excellent cuisine!!! 5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks and feels like an upscale cafeteria with service, and the service was good.  There were four of us, three ordered from the special menu.  No one raved about their entree.  I've had better mussels at The Fish Market, better spaghetti sauce at the Spaghetti Company and I rarely eat at either of these restaurants.  The appetizers were good, scallops in a bechamel sauce and a mixed greens salad.  As another reviewer commented, the web site looks better than the actual site, in every way.  For value, Trente-Cinq does not deliver."}
{"text":"If you visit Trente-Cinq, you may well find yourself asking the question that is posed on the white board in the men's room: \"Is this restaurant half empty or half full?\" I've been to Trente-Cinq twice and both times the restaurant was no more than half full. That may be due to the fact that Belgian food is a novelty in Phoenix, but I think it also has to do with the value-for-your-dollar that this restaurant offers. Four of us had three salads, two appetizers, three entrees, two desserts, an iced tea and five glasses of wine. With tax and tip, the tab came to just under $200. It's like the menu is in Euros instead of US Dollars given the current lousy exchange rate. The problem is that we're dining in Phoenix, not somewhere in Belgium. Factoring in the \"transitional\" location on 7th Street, $200 is too much to pay for the meal that we had. No wonder there's always plenty of tables at Trente-Cinq.

Chef Lionel Geuskens states on his website, \"I have always wanted to cook all of my favorite dishes.\" That's a laudable goal, but Chef Lionel needs to remember that his restaurant is located in the Valley of the Sun and not Belgium. He needs to add some seasonal dishes to his boilerplate menu. When I first visited in the fall, the hearty dishes were perfect for the season. When I recently had dinner with the BF and two friends at T-C in June, the menu seemed heavy and clunky. If the chef insists on keeping his hearty menu, he'd do well to close for the summer and wait for the weather to cool off before serving his stick-to-your-ribs fare.

I started off with the Boulettes ($10) appetizer. The menu says it's a dish of \"mini\" meatballs served in an herbed tomato sauce with mixed greens on the side. Three meatballs arrived that were as big as tennis balls. This dish was a good value as it could have been an entree, if you like eating thee meatballs for your dinner. The side salad was a weird accompaniment and very much appeared as an afterthought. The BF ordered the Salade D'endive ($9), which featured Belgian endive tossed with mixed greens, herbed goat cheese and candied walnuts with a raspberry vinaigrette. The portion was large, but the BF said my meatballs were a better choice.

For my entree, I ordered the Waterzooi ($23). This dish was also the entree I ordered on my first visit to T-C. It's basically a hearty fish soup of salmon, halibut, shrimp, scallops, mussels and vegetables in a saffron cream broth. Unfortunately, it was much tastier the first time. This time the sauce was fairly flat, which is a real disappointment given the saffron. The BF ordered what the menu purports to be the \"national dish of Belgium,\" Moules Au Vin Blanc ($19). It is a bowl of mussels steamed in white wine with leeks, celery, green onions and fresh herbs. It was a large serving of mussels and the BF felt it was a fair deal. Unlike the French version he's had at other places, the broth in this dish was not at all enjoyable on its own.

For our dining companions, one friend ordered the Coquilles Ostendaise ($12) appetizer as his entree. I had this dish as my appetizer on my first visit and it looked good this time as well. But then again, how can you go wrong with scallops baked in a cheese bechamel? His BF ordered the Steak Au Poivre ($28). The filet mignon was served with a green peppercorn sauce and fries. The steak was petit for the grand $28 price tag.

Our meal took a real dive in terms of value with dessert. The BF and I shared the Mousse Au Chocolat ($6). As billed on the menu, it was a trio of white, milk and dark chocolate mousses. The surprising part was the portion size. Given that this dessert is basically chocolate pudding, it was a bit surprising for it to arrive in what was essentially a double shot glass. It was good, but not $6 good. Our friends decided to share the Tropezienne ($8). The menu claims that this dessert is French brioche pastry filled with creamy vanilla custard. I'll allow for some hyperbole in menu writing, but this dessert was anything but French pastry filled with custard. It was really a slice of flat vanilla cake that had been cut in half and filled with what tasted like vanilla pudding. Ironically, our friend who ordered this dish is a pastry chef and it goes without saying that he was not impressed with this dessert.

If only the decor was as fun and inviting as the restaurant website would lead you to believe. This place either ascribes to a minimalist aesthetic or there wasn't budget to make the space interesting. It has a lower mid-range European hotel feel.

The service was attentive.  However, that wasn't enough to off-set the over-priced menu.

It is interesting to have a Belgian restaurant in Phoenix. If only Chef Lionel would alter his menu to reflect the seasons and discount his prices so that they appear to be in US Dollars rather than in Euros. Then Trente-Cinq would be good to go. Hopefully these changes will occur before T-C shutters its doors for good."}
{"text":"I've been on a mission to try new(ish), interesting, and non-chain establishments - so our visit to Trente-Cinq totally fit the bill.  We started at Lisa G's, but the menu was underwhelming for dinner, so we walked the twenty paces across the parking lot to this hip looking spot.  

First off, the decor is right out of Ikea - literally, the mirrors, lighting, and \"art\" were all from Ikea.  (What did all these businesses do before Ikea opened in Tempe??)  which I suppose isn't so bad in itself, but there just didn't seem to be any point of view and the design was simply ho-hum.

The food was good, but not \"oh-my-God\" good.  I certainly could live without visiting there again.  I can't say that I am a Belgian food aficionado (or that I even comprehend Belgian food) - certainly someone who has been to Belgium might very well appreciate the menu more than me.  The table next to us was quite taken with their choices which were decidedly more Belgian that what we were eating.

I wish that I could say more positive things about the place - anyone who tries something new in Phoenix should be applauded."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful.  Atmosphere lovely.  I found the service slightly awkward - made me wonder if the host and servers had ever been in a restaurant before.  I would certainly go again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Trente-Cinq on a weekday evening, and there was only one other person in the place.  Personally, I like that.  We got plenty of attention from the server and were able to enjoy each other, our wine, and our conversation in the quiet candelight.
I ordered the Waterzooi, which I ve had twice now.  The seafood tasted amazingly fresh both times, which is impressive here in Phoenix.
Trente-Cinq is a bit of refreshing variety in a mostly corporate restaurant world and I hope they are able to weather these tough economic times. They're a nice addition to the 7th Street corridor and I hope more people will dine here to support this unique restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend, and enjoyed it. 

Then I came again with other friends to get a bite to eat, at 910 pm. This shouldn't have been a problem since I knew their huge sign outside claimed they were open til 10.

The owner of the restaurant himself told us they were closed. There were several other customers inside as he told us this. We had gone out of our way to come to Trente-Cinq, so we were all pretty turned off and offended by this treatment. We went to Lisa G's next door instead, where they seem to actually appreciate new customers.

I'm not a huge fan of false advertising. One star."}
{"text":"We were in town from San Francisco to visit friend and decided to take them out to a nice dinner.  After a bit of searching we came upon Trente-Cinq.  We were VERY impressed with this restaurant.  We had the scallop and asparagus appetizers which were great! Then I had the lamb shank for dinner which was the best lamb shank I have ever had. It was in a flavorful sweet broth with couscous and sweet potatoes on the side.  Our friends had the mussels which we were worried about given that we are used to very fresh seafood.  However, the chef did not disappoint. Overall the food was fresh, properly seasoned and VERY flavorful. A true Phoenix gem.

The only downside was that there were not more people in the restaurant. Everyone in Phoenix should be going to the this restaurant as it would be a travesty if it closed."}
{"text":"My family is Belgian and we have eaten here several times.  My mother and grandmother are natives of the Flemish side.  We have never had a bad meal; the desserts are absolutely amazing, and the entrees are always delicious.  I don't eat mussels, but my mom loves them."}
{"text":"we went for an anti valentines/birthday and the food was good, the ambience was nice, it was fun. we had to wait a bit and the chef, who was the only one in the kitchen compt us some of their famous fries, yummy."}
