{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was good. However, I was disturbed by the way my French fries were served. It came in a paper wrapping in a metal coil. Sounds innocuous. The wrapper is a facsimile of a newspaper dated May 17, 1861. I will post a photograph of it.  This is a quote from thecivilwarproject.com regarding that date: \"Confederate President Jefferson Davis signs a bill to bring North Carolina into the Confederacy if its citizens vote to secede and support the Confederate Constitution.\"  Is this a coincidence?  Either way I was not amused.  Make of it what you will."}
{"text":"We were there for a Saturday morning brunch. The food was good but the service needs a lot of improvement. We were not told at the time of checking in that the buffet closes within next 10 minutes. By the time we settled in and had already started that we were informed the buffet closes in few minutes."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and attentive and the food was a pleasant surprise. I got the Hangover burger and cooked the way I like it, and it was right the first time. The burgers are huge so you definitely won't leave here hungry. The side Salad and lemon vinaigrette was also very good and freshly prepared. You might save a couple bucks going out somewhere else, but c'mon it's right inside the hotel and the food and service were both good quality. I'd definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Food was good; however they wouldn't honor my 10% discount from yelp on my breakfast. Waitress indicated it was only for dinner. Fresh fruit and omelette was good. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Lakefront, this is the main restaurant in the Hilton at University Place.  We had a coupon for Lakefront we wanted to use  so we drove over after Church today for brunch.  Very spacious and well appointed.  It reminds me a lot of the Hyatt in Marietta Ga with it's glass wall and view of the Japanese Garden. Does not have a Japanese Garden but does have a beautiful view of a Lake and artificial waterfalls.  My wife ordered a Steak Salad.  Actually there are serveral salads available and you can get steak or chicken or other items added.  She also ordered a side of seasonal fruits which for a change, was something more that just mellon.  I had a shrimp Po Boy that except for being a bit overcooked was excellent. My side was a simple salad which was anything except simple with a pretora of mixed greens, tomotoes, pickles etc. It was so hugh I could not eat all of it.  Service was outstanding from start to finish and I have to give high marks to the entire staff.  Outstanding Lunch and by the way, they did honor the coupon we had even though it's no longer Lakefront.  We definately be back and may try and get there early enough for the breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"The She Crab Soup....is amazing but that's about it. So far I've been to this restaurant 3 times since I've been here and the service had been slow or non existant. The beef short rib was not great but the sides were good. The seafood hushpuppy was not great either. But the She Crab Soup...changes lives.   The have a full stocked bar and televisions on ever walk but they are all set to sports. When I asked for a TV off in the far corner where I was sitting to be changed to a cooking show...they told me No and that all TVs should be on sports but two of the main TVs were set to TMZ only once I pointed that out did they change my TV off in the corner. I also checked in to Yelp and ended up with 10% off my bill by surprise and no one knew they had it and it took forever for them to fix my bill and I was sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good.  The decor could use some updating, but other than that it was excellent.  Great views of the lake.  The salmon with the mustard sauce was awesome.  Very good service also."}
{"text":"I LOVE the breakfast buffet here!  They have biscuits and gravy, turkey sausage, bacon, fluffy eggs, potatoes, hash browns,  hot cakes (or french toast or waffles), fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, cereal, AND an omelet station!  Pick your ingredients and the cook will make you a delicious omelet, and they can even cook with egg whites if you prefer.  LOVE that they have smoked salmon as well!  I ordered a breakfast sandwich off the menu once too; I got the croissant sandwich which came with eggs, pesto, bacon, tomato, and spinach.  It comes wide a side of hash browns and fresh fruit.  The restaurant itself sits right on the lake, and has a fairly large dining area.  The bar is a separate room but also considered part of the restaurant.  For dinner one evening, my coworkers and I ordered the hush puppies, nachos, and bruschetta.  All dishes were alright but nothing special.   Breakfast alone is 5 stars, the rest is about average.  Definitely would recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ordered room service and got it very promptly. I ordered a cup of the she crab soup, a small order of the trout and a side order of asparagus. Had I known that the portions were so big I would have only ordered one thing. The crab soup was pretty good and I loved the crab meat and the scallion pancake that it came with. The trout was delicious, pan seared so that the skin was crispy but still very moist on the outside. However, I could have done without the bacon and green beans that it was served with which were way too heavy for me. The side asparagus was on point but a bit oily. The entire meal only cost $28 which included tip and delivery surcharge! What a steal! This definitely surpassed my expectations of what I would be getting from hotel food."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hilton, I love the breakfast buffets this place offers! They always have my favorite, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage, french toast (or pancakes), some sort of potatoes, two types of scrambled eggs, fruit, lox/tomatoes/capers, and of course, the omelet station! tons of toppings to choose from, and they even have egg whites as well! she'll also fry up an egg any way you like it if you dont want an omelet/scramble. plus they have a side area of yogurt, granola, fruit to go, danishes/bagels, cereal, and more. Staff here are super nice, always getting you your drinks.  Had dinner here as well, and unfortunately their dinner is just sub-par. We had 2 platters of cheese and crackers to start off with, and all the cheeses were yummy! First time I had sage cheese, and surprisingly, it was good, even with all the green!   For dinner, we had the pita and pesto hummus which was very good. Their fresh sourdough bread is amazing too! I chose their tomato basil soup, which I've had before, and it was good, but it's never piping hot. Their salads looked amazing too! Their dinner menu isn't too extensive, some fish dishes (the salmon seems to be a fave), steak dishes, and pasta. I went with the southern meal that I can't have regularly, shrimp n grits. The grits were made into crab cake portions, with shrimp and andouille sausage. It wasn't the shrimp and grits I was imagining, I wanted the grits to be more of a porridge, so was let down. But luckily I was too full, I could only eat a quarter of my dish anyways.  Great service, and we had 2 birthdays to celebrate, and the desserts they brought out were so nice! Would highly recommend them for their breakfast, although I wish they had hash browns as a potato option! Everyone raved about the salmon and gnocchi for dinner, so would recommend that too!"}
{"text":"My lovely bride and I happened upon this place while running some errands in the Boardwalk area. We figured the hotel would have to have a restaurant. We were greeted warmly and promptly seated. Not over crowded on Saturday afternoon. Christina took excellent care of us and her recommendations were spot on. I ordered the Caliente Burger my wife got the nachos. The Caliente Burger was so good I stopped halfway through devouring it to take a picture (had to share it with my fellow Yelpers). Nice amount of spice and excellent flavor. Very juicy and BIG. The sweet potato fries were tender and sweet with a light crispy, even flaky exterior. They are served with a creamy concoction that has a light citrus but and pleasant flavor for dipping.  The nachos were pretty good (appetizer menu) plenty big enough to share but nothing to write home about.  Wife got a (huge) slice of strawberry shortcake cheesecake for desert. It was great!  Only thing keeping them from getting all five stars from me is the price. I DO understand it is a Hilton but the area they are situated in is not going to draw the crowd for that price.   When are they going to drive the geese out of that nasty pond and clean that place up...? I know.. off topic, but still.  12 bucks for a burger (well worth it) and 45 bucks for lunch for two (with tip-no alcohol) is too much to make us regulars, but for a nice lunch on a whim we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really loved the Lakefront Restaurant. I used a Verizon rewards coupon for buy one get one free dinner entrees. I ordered the turkey sandwich and was more than satisfied by their guacamole and thick slices of turkey on the sandwich. The fries were also very fresh tasting. My boyfriend ordered the hangover burger that came with bacon, onions, cheese, and egg and enjoyed it as well. We both brought home to-go boxes with about half of our meal. We sat right by the window and had a great view of the boardwalk and lake. Lastly, the chocolate cake (order with ice cream!) for dessert was simply delicious- moist and sweet. My only complaint is the gap in serving times; this was our second attempt at dining here because the first time I did not realize that lunch was served until 2 or 3 and dinner didn't start until 5 and we came around 4. I cannot wait to go back and try the breakfast buffet!"}
{"text":"Had a business mtg within a couple miles of this place and was looking for a breakfast place that had Gluten free options.    This was the one with the best options within 5 miles of my mtg.       They are located inside of a Hilton.    So a good make your own omelette from eggs and not from a box, side of bacon, GF Hashbrowns, bowl of fruit and two pieces of Udi's GF toast.    Good start to morning.  Bit pricey but worth it if you travel and have food allergies."}
{"text":"Overall good place if you are rating in hotel. Waitstaff was slammed and they really needed more help. I got fried pickles as an app and they were good. I like the sliced pickles not the spears so it was perfect. I also ordered the ribeye with Brussel sprouts and green beans. The steak was over cooked but had a great blue cheese sauce. I also ordered chicken wings the next day for lunch. I ordered them hot- buffalo style. The order came with 12 and they were large. Unfortunately they were just okay. I wonder if a different sauce would be better. They were rather bland. So, for a quick and convenient hotel meal, I would do it again."}
{"text":"A good place to chill and relax. Rates are a bit higher. But the service and ambience is decent. Like the taste overall"}
{"text":"Expensive hotel breakfast buffet.  Not worth the cost(unless you're staying there and it's included in your room costs)"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for Easter because the number of non-asian and non mexican choices on Restaurant.com are limited. I wanted a steak and fish place not too far from home. I had to make reservations for 5:00 as they would not take my gift certificate for the brunch hours. Let me begin that our man who was our Server was Excellent. Very attentive. This place is located in a hotel. While walking into the restaurant, we noticed the carpet had Not been vacuumed in the the 2 hour break between brunch and dinner. There were two other tables occupied so it was not like it was overflowing with people. The menu is very limited. The wine choices even house wines were 8.00 and up. A White Haven Savignon blanc is 16.00 a bottle in stores and was 11.00 per glass in this place. Talk about markup. My son and I ordered the Ribeye, my friend order the Sea Bass. the Sea Bass looked fresh and presentation was good. I tasted a bit of her fish and it had a nice outward crispness and inside white and flaky but a bit oily tasting. Our ribeye steaks were an embarrassment. I do not understand why the trend to cut nice 1/2 in to 1 in steaks in half horizontally. except to make more money.The steaks were cooked to order surprisingly, but if they were 1/4\" thick . there was a lot of fat on the edges that had to be cut off. which reminded me more of the fat you get on a prime rib. the mashed potatoes were gummy. the  best part was the sauteed spinach which was suppose to be creamed spinach.  At 22.00 for 1/4\"\"  thickness of a ribeye I will not be returning to this establishment. Good thing I had the 25.00 off the bill. I could have gotten a great steak at Outback for the price."}
{"text":"Since this restaurant was in the hotel I was staying at while in Charlotte; I opted on dining here two of the three nights of my stay. I have to stay that the service here was top notch. The bartenders were personable, chatty (but not in an annoying way) and gave me good menu recommendations.  Each time I dined here I had the seafood hushpuppies which were delicious (5 stars). The shrimp & grits were a stomach pleaser and the half portion was huge for only $13 (4 stars). The short rib and mac & cheese was a miss because while the mac &a cheese was 4 stars the short rib was 1 star which brought this entree overall down to (2.5 stars).  If you are staying at this hotel I do recommend dining here, but skip the short rib dish!"}
{"text":"Went for the breakfast buffet and it was very good. Quality of food (minus the waffles) were really good. Omelettes were made fresh, bacon wasn't the cheap kind, fruits were good. Only thing that I didn't really like is that the waffles tasted like the free waffles you get at the 1-2star hotels. They did make it fresh for you but it wasn't that tasty. Service was \"okay\". My server never came to my table until I called for him. I definitely recommend the buffet breakfast.  Views from outside are also very nice as well."}
