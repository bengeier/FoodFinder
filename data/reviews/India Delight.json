{"text":"Oh, this place is classic!  South Indian people trying to cook North Indian food. Okay for the nonIndian people who are confused let me explain.  Ya know how they have southern Italian food and northern Italian food? Southern Italian food uses a lot of red sauce, pasta, olives, red wine while northern Italian food incorporates a lot of white sauces, grilled items and butter?  Yes, it's an entirely different cuisine.  Likewise, south Indian food is very different than north Indian food but north Indian food is popular and it's what constitutes \"Indian food\" much like southern Italian food is what primarily constitutes \"Italian food\"  So what ends up happening is you have South Indian people trying to cook North Indian food because the food from the North is what is popular.(Dosa not withstanding)

And this lack of expertise was imminent among the cooks and owners. Chicken tikka masala is boneless pieces of chicke tikka that is supposed to grilled first and then served in a sauce.  They had some pieces of dark bone meat chicken makhani in their buffet. I asked to see a menu because I wanted to try their chicken tikka masla. The owner argued with me saying that chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala are the same thing with the exception of cream. WRONG!  A true punjabi restaurant would never make that claim.  Anyway, so I tried the buffer because I could tell they were too lazy to cook anything similar to what was in their buffet that afternoon.  The buffet was tasteless, the saag was watery, the chicken makhani tasted as if they dumped some chicken into Campbel's tomatoe soup and added butter.  

We ordered their \"Indo-Chinese\"...again, I have had real Indian Chinese and this place tried to make Indian manchurian...

Bottomline: If you are a clueless white dude who wants to just try Indian food for the first time, I recommend this place. You won't know any better and its good enough to send you home happy. Unlike most Indian restaurants, you will like the ambience here. It's fairly large, has vaulted ceilings, is clean and the service was good.  If you are Indian or a white dude that knows him some good Indian food, skip this place"}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet on a Saturday. Good ambiance, good food, friendly staff. Indian music videos on 2 big screen TVs were entertaining. Everything I tried was tasty - chicken, lamb and they even have a dish with shrimp in it. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Went to the buffet, which is Monday-Friday from 10:30am to 2:30pm. The cost was a scant $8.99 -- not too shabby

Sampled

* Chicken Makhani  -- the chicken was a bit dry. I am guessing that they use their leftover chicken tikka. I also found a couple of bones in the curry, which was a first for me. I've never found any in my chicken curries before. The curry was nice and flavorful, it had a very subtle heat and really added to the dish overall. I just wish the chicken hadn't been so dry.

* Plain rice -- it was a smidge undercooked for me. I like my pasta, but not my rice, al dente.

* Potato curry -- potatoes were a bit undercooked as well, but they were so nice. You know when you underboil potaotes? That's what happened here. The potatoes were spiced just right.

* Fish fry -- sampled 2 small pieces that were just right...but again, a bit colder than I would have preferred.

* Daal -- mashed chickpeas littered with indian spices -- it was very pleasant.

* Gulab Jamen (dessrt) -- was a bit...cake-like. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something was a bit off.

Plain naan brought to table -- YUMMY!!!!!!

Food is bit on the cold side. I wish it could have been a little bit warmer. I know it's hard keeping accurate temps on food as if it's too hot, then it's a breeding ground for bacteria, but honestly...I do like my food a bit warmer. I don't like feeling as I'm eating some leftovers from someone's dinner the night before.

Service is a bit reserved and polite. I did find it odd that they had the little jacket that housed your receipt and brought it to the table. In most establishments I've been to, you normally put your card/cash in it and they come by to take it...I waited for 15 minutes then realized I had to go up and pay. Was a bit odd. Maybe I was taught wrong. Who knows?

If it gets busy, it looks like this place could get crowded mostly because of how the tables are set up. They're pushed together fairly close, but not as bad as some other places I've been to. They have a few booth seats. It's nice and clean inside. The buffet was kept immaculate, until little Messy Me came by, accidentally spilling curry and rice in my wake. Oops...my bad! The men working there seemed friendly enough.

I'll try this place again if I am ever on this side of town, but I won't actively seek it out. For me, it's better than Guru Palace."}
{"text":"Alexis and I were excited when we saw an Indian restaurant open up in our neighborhood.   We have neighborhood restaurants and will support them over chains any day.  There is only a few catches.   1] Service has to be friendly and they were very friendly.  2] Clean and though my fork was less than clean, overall the place was clean and you can tell that the employees and owners really take it seriously. 3] Food has to be great.   So this is where the had a less than enjoyable time.  We went mid-afternoon and it was buffet only.  Hmmm, ok.  Odd but ok.  Nothing was cold, the Chicken was average but acceptable.   The Naan was doughy. In the end, we came, we saw, we ate, we wanted more and both agreed that we will not be back.  For a very beautiful restaurant, we think they should have spend more on the food and less on the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been going to India Delight for several months, and overall our experience has been great.  The chicken vindaloo is tangy, spicy and delicious.  I think they might tone down the spice a bit for most people, but order it spicy and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
