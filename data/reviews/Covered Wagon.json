{"text":"Wow, unexpected...
I've passed this place on the road several years without stopping by to give it a try.
I ordered a BLT sandwich, thinking it would be small,Ike every other restaurant I've been too. We'll guess again, this sandwich was massive. I'm talking a solid 4 inches thick, and filled with bacon, ham, cheese... You name it! I'm a big dude, and I was having a hard time finishing the thing.
The staff was welcoming and attentive. The inside is a little worn down and ruffed up a bit, but don't let that fool ya.'
Apparently the restaurant has improved quite a bit over the past few years. I heard its because of new management. 
Any way, I had a great experience here, and I would recommend this place to anyone trying to get as much \"bang for their buck.\""}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!!!!

Doesn't look like much from the outside, but there is a reason the parking lot is always full!!!

Found this place 6 years ago or so and have loved it every time ever since.  We actually drive 4 hours sometimes just to eat here!  Prime rib is the best I have ever had!  Service is top-notch!  Would surely recommend!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour to get chicken strips, locals that ordered after us go there food first. Food is not that great either."}
{"text":"Excellent prime rib on Sat nights! Great steak and shrimp dinner nightly! Worth the drive for quality and price!"}
{"text":"Heading for Duluth, ran across this place for lunch. Lots of options on the menu. I ordered a BLT basket based on a previous review. Came out quick and hot. A pleasant stop for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We were heading to amnicon State Park to do some water falling and it was raining and we thought let's go find a place for breakfast we found this quaint little place wow we were very surprised. Steak and eggs were excellent and my husband's  breakfast was great service is wonderful and it was out in the middle of nowhere what a wonderful surprise if we're ever in the area again will stop by and have steak and eggs and he'll have sausage and scrambled and hash browns and toast what a wonderful Delight."}
