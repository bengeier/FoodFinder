{"text":"La Habanera est un de ces endroits qui met du soleil dans la grisaille de l'hiver! Petit et charmant, on y propose des plats d'inspiration cubaine style tapas. Pour deux personnes nous avons commandé 4 plats et c'était amplement suffisant! Tout était excellent: crevettes au coco, empanadas, tacos au poisson....gros coup de cur pour le cubano sandwich qui est très généreux!"}
{"text":"Très beau petit restaurant cubain avec une ambiance et un décor chaleureux, parfait pour se dépayser un peu par un soir d'hiver. Ça coûte moins cher qu'un billet pour Cuba, mais je doute qu'ils acceptent que vous y passiez une semaine complète.

Les cocktails et le rhum sont à l'honneur et le choix est intéressant. Pour ce qui est de la bouffe, c'est une formule qui ressemble à celle des restaurants à tapas. La meilleure chose à faire est de commander plusieurs plats (comptez 2-3 plats par personne, soit environ 15-30$ selon les choix) et de les partager. Les deux plats de tacos (poulet et poisson) sont excellents, ainsi que la salade et le poulet à la créole. Le genre de resto où on retourne plusieurs fois et on essaie chaque truc du menu au fur et à mesure. C'est petit, alors vaut mieux réserver."}
{"text":"La Habenera is an adorable small plates Cuban fusion restaurant. The interior and exterior decor is impeccable. It's a dimly lit Friday night hang out kind of place. The staff is super friendly and the service was great. They have a fantastic drinks selection. I feel like you can't order wrong drinks wise. Obviously their mojitos take the cake but there are plenty of other drinks that are also great. I had a pina colada that came in a small pineapple shaped container. 

The small plates are interesting but they are quite small. You would have to order 3-4 per person for a full meal so it can get quite pricey. My favourite small dish item would be the buns. They have a fantastic texture to the bun and the meat is well seasoned with a strong sauce. I was not as huge a fan of the cevice but the ribs were also well glazed. 

Pros: Atmosphere, service, drinks
Cons: Food is interesting but not spectacular, can be pricey if you order a lot. 

Tips: This place is busy. They have 2 services for dinner which you can make reservations for. Do the reservation. As we were eating we saw two groups get turned away."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I got lucky that a two was available for one when I arrived so I sat right away. Server was attentive. Fish tacos and pizza empanada were on point! After I crushed those I was feeling groggy so I ordered the croquettes. Should have stopped at the tacos and empanada. I'm sure they were good I just wasn't a fan. I tipped it off with a double of Ron Zacappa 23."}
{"text":"Overall: Excellent cocktails and food. Decent service and nice cozy hispter decor. 

Drinks: I had a guava pina colada and it was succulent. Taste of guava was subtle, but mixed well with the drink. 

Food: Fish tacos is just simply delicious.  Made of deep fried cod and garnished with mangos and ginger pineapple sauce add freshness to the overall plate. 

Braised chicken with creole sauce is drumsticks braided in a sauce quite a bit spicy for those with a more sensitive tongue. I really enjoyed the meal though. 

Beef skewers can be skipped in my opinion. The meat was a bit dry and there isn't really anything special to it. 

Plantain cups with shrimps is another plate that I enjoyed. The coconut dulce de leche was made on point without covering the freshness of the shrimps. The plaintain cup was alright and has a texture like potatoes which i'm not big fan of."}
{"text":"Des plats savoureux qui surprennent, un décor coloré qui nous fait sentir dans le milieu des Caraïbes, des cocktails originaux, bien balancés qui sont tous excellents, un endroit avec de l'ambiance sans être trop bruyant et des prix qui nous donnent envie de revenir dès le lendemain. Toutes ces raisons expliquent pourquoi ce Resto est complet soir après soir, donc hâtez-vous de réserver et d'essayer un des meilleurs nouveaux restos en ville. Une valeur sûre!"}
{"text":"Ahhh having been wanting to come here for months but never finding a seat (and never planning ahead enough to reserve), I really really REALLY wanted to love La Habanera. I finally came here for dinner a couple nights ago, and quickly decided on many exciting looking items to share only to be told once we came to order that at least half the menu had run out (we're talking Friday night dinner here...) so we had to settle for some other items we were not so keen on.

1. Avocado salad: delicious!!!!
2. Shrimp/coconut/rum cups: meh. These were not bad but not great. Wouldn't order again
3. Beef skewers: very yummy but also kinda pricy for what you get ($8 for two very small skewers)
4. Braised chicken: super meh. Nothing special at all
5. Pulled chicken tacos: pretty tasteless
6. Side of rice with beans: it's rice and beans..... no innovation here and actually a little on the dry side

Because La Habanera is a tapas style restaurant, we initially ordered 4 plates to share at the recommendation of the hostess but it was definitely not enough as the potions are really small so we ordered two more and ended up still somewhat hungry but not impressed by anything enough to order more of it.

At the end of the meal, we were presented with a lovely $100 bill for six plates and 4 drinks. Not impressed to be honest - way too much for what you get and the stuff we tried wasn't that great (granted, about $40 was for the drinks, but still). That being said, we were really keen on several dishes that were not available (chicken bao, ribs, poutine) so maybe this review would've been different if we were able to try them but nonetheless, the price is really not well correlated to the food you get.

Overall, a solid 3 stars. Great service, cute ambiance and some great dishes. I'll be back to try the items I missed out on and will update my review if they change my rating!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience I had tonight! I got there not knowing what to expect, I've never really had the chance to visit Cuba nor eat any of their local dish, but I thought to myself \"hey let's be adventurous\"... 

As I pushed the door, I've noticed that the place was very well decorated, it was like changing city within less than five seconds and oh bummer it also appeared that the place was realllllllly tiny. The waitress asked whether I had made a reservation, of course I completely forgot about that part..She then mentioned that it would be challenging but she would have a seat at the bar if I could eat in 50 minutes, to which I answered sure (yeahhh!!) I have to mention that many people couldn't get in throughout the evening because of the lack of seats so read between the lines (and make a reservation to secure one). As La Habanera is more of a Cafe Bar, there aren't specific services, you can choose between plenty of different little dishes. I had the Aguacate (thumbs up for this dish which was my ultimate fave) where the idea came from to mix nougat with red papaya, avocado and mojito dressing? Because this is genius! I also had fish tacos which are made of cod tempura, mango ceviche, ginger and pineapple crema, the seasoning was on point! As dessert, I ordered the 3 leches (oh my this was tasty)...Oh and I almost forgot! I also ordered a white rum drink, the Pinoy mojito, which was succulent as well.

The atmosphere was so relaxed, the decoration so not typical and the staff so nice and helpful that it made my overall experience sooo worth it....I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone there everything was excellent. Probably amongst the best food I've ever had, really. And the mojitos, although fairly costly, are SO good. Not too sweet, just perfect and fresh. I love going there! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great food, great staff! What a nice place! As I've seen in other reviews, yes! The fish tacos are definitely a must try! I also really liked the shrimp/coconut milk/plantain-I-don't-remember-the-name. The shrimps were perfectly cooked it was amazing!!! 
I like the fact that they let you choose the rum you want to put in your cocktails and that they actually give you great advice in regards to what would go best in the cocktail. I really liked their habanera mojito. They also had a pineapple/mango mojito that day which was to die for! 
Honestly, that place is my little \"food/cocktail place crush\" of 2017 for now"}
{"text":"Very tiny and cute Cuban place downtown with good, strong cocktails and really tasty food. We had some outstanding pineapple ribs, a spicy and delicious plate of braised Creole chicken, the aguacate salad with nougat (fantastic), the very tender beef pinchos, rice and beans, and the tres leches for dessert. Everything was outstanding. They make a decent classic mojito as well. The service is really friendly. 

The only downside is how cramped it is while you are waiting to be seated (the staff could stand to communicate a bit more with guests to let them know what is going on in order to avoid confusion). They do seem to take reservations, though, so that is probably the way to go. We will definitely be back soon to try other dishes, as we were really impressed by the food; it is simple and very well done."}
{"text":"Everything we tasted was great! Fish tacos were so good i ordered them twice. Loved the mojitos especially the one with cucumbers."}
{"text":"Had the pork ribs, fried chicken bao and fried cod fish tacos at La Habanera. Yes, I did use the North American-ised versions of their names that make it sound a lot less cooler. But the food was delicious. With my limited experience with Cuban food eating cubanos which was probably created in North America, I wasn't expecting the sweetness with a spicy kick in Cuban food, which was great. The place has a nice cozy vibe to it."}
{"text":"Was actually having drinks at the Irish Pub around the corner and by chance happened to check my trusty Yelp app to see if I had any nearby places bookmarked and lo and behold, La Habanera! Been meaning to try this spot for a minute. So once my boo arrived, we headed over. 

Lucky for us, the place had a table available for us. It's a small, intimate space, so I imagine there are people waiting during busier hours. Upon first glance, one can't help but think \"date spot.\" But not a tinder date spot. We're talking the kind of place you take that special someone. Nice soft lighting, charming and thoughtful decor. My boo and I happened to stumble into here but the romance juices were flowing a bit I must admit. 

She had one of the mojitos (I believe it had blackberry in it) and it was super tasty and sweet. We also had the pulled chicken tacos, the fish tacos, and the Bao with fried chicken. Everything was amazing. I probably would've enjoyed slightly larger portions for that price, but I think the ambience and experience made up for it. 

We're definitely coming back. Probably on a rainy weekday evening when it isn't crowded again :)"}
{"text":"We ate here because we couldn't get a table at Escondite next door. The staff was very slow to take our orders, but quick to get rid of our plates. The cocktails were ok, but nothing special. We asked for vegetarian options, as the menu is VERY limited. They offered to make us the papaya salad vegetarian as well as some \"vegetarian\" tacos.... These tacos were basically corn with nothing else, and the salad was ok, but mostly cucumber. The bill, came out to 67$ plus tip... Definitely not worth it for vegetarians, but maybe the meat dishes are good... Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Restaurant en plein centre ville de Montreal, à deux pas de La Baie...et une super halte lors d'une journée de magasinage.... 
Été comme hiver ce restaurant cubain saura réchauffer vos curs! L'ambiance y est agréable avec une musique cubaine entraînante et la décoration est juste magnifique! Pour preuve, l'endroit est pris d'assaut midi et soir! 
Les serveurs sont attentionnés et le Barman a le secret des cocktails les plus colorés et goûteux!
Le menu est composé de tapas cubains et tout est original, fruité, épicé, colore....le choix est cornélien! 
Pour 2 personnes nous avons opte pour la salade de papaye; les tacos de morue, les crevettes au rhum et lait de coco et le poulet frit au safran! 
Simplement un régal.....
Les prix ne sont pas élevés mais il est certain que le menu don ne envie de tout tester...ce qui fait vite grimper la note.....
Je conseille également ce restaurant pour les soirées entre amis!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Cuban food and a really fun and friendly vibe. We showed up without a reso and they were happy to accommodate just letting us know the table was booked in 90 min - happy when we can all work together! We ordered quite a few items on the menu and were not disappointed . Good for sharing as it is mostly small plates, both the chicken and the fish tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"The food at La Habanera was delicious!  It's small plates, so sort of like Cuban tapas.  It's a bit pricey since the portions are really small.  The server recommended 2 plates per person, which is what we did, but honestly I think I could have eaten 6-8 plates, but my wallet wouldn't have liked that very much, LOL.   

I started off with the Guava Pina Colada ($11).  Despite it not being a blended drink like I thought it would be (aka was not like a slushie), I still enjoyed it a lot.  It had rum, guava juice, hazelnut syrup, pineapple juice, RumChata, and peach bitters, and it was topped off with some roasted coffee beans.  It was part fruity, part spicy (like cinnamon/nutmeg spicy, not hot peppers spicy) and all creamy.  My husband had some sort of beer.

We ordered the Tacos de ropa vieja de pollo (2 chicken tacos) ($8), a side of Moros (rice and black beans) ($4), a pizza empanada ($7), Tostones rellenos de camarones (2 plantain cups filled with coconut and dulce de leche shrimps) ($10) and Pinchos de carne (2 beef skewers) ($8).  This was enough for a light meal (we actually ended up going for Chinese food later that night, lol).

The tacos were fairly small, but they were full of flavour.  They had pulled chicken, red bell peppers, cheese (queso fresco), some sort of slaw, toasted corn (like \"Corn Nuts\"), salsa, and topped with fresh cilantro leaves.  Super tasty!  The side of rice and black beans on the other hand was a big disappointment.  So bland and tasteless :(  However, the rice was fluffy and the beans were a good consistency.  

I loved the Tostones.  The base was plantains and they were formed into cups (as if they were baked in a muffin tin) and filled with 2 large shrimp in a coconut and garlic creamy dulce de leche sauce.  It was sweet yet savoury and tasted very \"tropical.\"  I could easily have eaten 3 orders of these by myself; they were that good.

The beef skewers were another winner.  They were marinated with tamarind and annatto.  The beef was so tender and the flavouring was excellent.  If price were no issue, I would have eaten 10 skewers!  

My husband loved the pizza empanada, but I was like \"meh.\"  It was tiny and there was only 1.  In my opinion it was just a glorified pizza pocket.  It was too oily/greasy for my liking.

Service was very friendly and attentive.

Decor is cool, with lots of Cuban paraphernalia.  I also loved the neon flamingo, lol.  I've never been to Cuba, but it's what I imagine a small local restaurant in Cuba would look like.  

Bottom line: delicious but pricey (but maybe it's because I have a huge appetite.  People who eat like birds might find it just right)."}
{"text":"Excellent petit resto cubain très cosy, au décor et à la musique qui sauront vous dépayser!
La poutine au yuca est excellente, les tacos aussi!
Les portions sont quand même petites, l'idée est de partager en mode tapas
Prix ok pour le quartier
Drinks top
Très bon service
Conseil: réservez!
A essayer!!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor. Menu offers great variety of Cuban dishes. Very slow service though. The dining room is small so if you want to go for lunch, arrive early. Food was good."}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place on my way to Koa Lua and thinking to myself: Oh yeah, I wanted to try this. And I finally did! 

I got the Yucca poutine and the chicken tacos.
It's really unique. I've never had food like this. The flavours, the presentation, the textures, it all caught me by surprise. I mean sure it's tacos, cuban poutine, and the likes but there's such a unique twist to them that I was enchanted.

The portions were a bit small so perfect for a 5a7 or for tapas with friends. It's not really a sit down and have a long dinner kinda place.

I didn't have a reservation so I sat at the bar with my boyfriend and it was ok but not the best seat in the house. It gets more hectic at the bar.

I didn't order a drink but my boyfriend got a light blonde beer and he said it was good.

I highly recommend this place. Such a cool and funky vibe with some great food to share."}
{"text":"A cool Cuban spot to go for lunch but usually fills up quickly. It's mostly consisting of tapas with delicious tacos but don't expect a full meal option you have to order a few things on the menu. It's more of a bar menu then a restaurant I would say."}
{"text":"Went there for the poutine week special, Yucca potato fries with cheese curds. I ordered the avocado salad which was delish! It contains all the ingredients for a mojito and more, with avocado, melon and cucumber, it was a refreshing dish that paired nicely with the poutine. The bar tender was on fire, mixing drinks while I ate at the bar. It's a tiny place tucked away on a smaller street under some construction. I honestly never heard of this place before the MTL Gazette blog on poutine week. Overall, it's a nice Cuban styled resto (although I can't judge whether it's legit Cuban cuisine) and a nice place to hit up after work.  The place is small so one might need to reserve to get a table for 4+."}
{"text":"Love it for a friends get together! Slightly inconsistent but good. Would give it a 6.5/10 if possible but I see the potential in this little Cuban fusion restaurant. Got a tasting menu for about $30/person

Avocado salad (7/10) was one of the best dishes. It was fresh and the light basil dressing brought everything together. The magic was the nougat as a topping, such a pleasant surprise for crunch and chewiness. 

Empanadas (6.5/10)were good, crispy and stuffed generously. Secret is cheese curds. 

Papaya salad (6/10) was decent but I could live without It. 

Fried cod taco (5/10) - texture was monotone. Lacking a some kinda of crunch. The cod didn't have a crispy exterior and due to the sauce that was drizzled over, made it soggy. Topped with mango salsa, it was okay. A lot of sweet mango going on. Needs some type of crunch and firmness to this dish. 

The pincho de carne (7.5/10) skewers were amazing! They were juicy, tender and perfectly grilled. 

Saffron rice (7/10) better than black bean rice (5.5/10). Black bean was too heavy and missing acidity. Saffron rice was delicious! 

The cubano (3.5/10) was lacking some type of jus or spice, overall was missing more flavouring. Wouldn't order it again, I suggest adding a lot of spice or something to make it different.

Dessert 
Nutella flan (6/10) - their version of flan was very dense but tasteful. 

Tres leches (5.5/10) - light and a perfect end to the meal *people who don't like regular light flan might love this a lot*

TLTR - totally would recommend but make rsvp first. Loved the ambiance and drinks are amazing! Definitely guava pina colada hands down."}
{"text":"Found this place walking by. it was very inviting with big open windows out to the street. Nice decor and atmosphere.  Had Mojitos they were very awesome! Never had Cuban food before, and it was amazing. The tapas style made it great to get a bunch of different things to try and share. Server and hostess were great as well. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This cute little place on Avenue Union has been on my go to list for a long time. I must say it didn't live up to the hype I expected from the reviews. 

It's very small, the food is almost small portions. You'd think it's not expensive but order two of dishes and a drink- you would have spent money and still be hungry. 
I wasn't too fond of their fish tacos as it has a sweet twist to it. The chicken tacos were delicious, pizza empanada was too dry. 

Service was quick, the place was a bit too cramped up. 
I ordered the guava pina colada and to my surprise I couldn't taste much guava but it had a strong coffee flavor.
The mange mojito was a better option. 

I would not go to this place again, especially after you have been to Escondite next door. 

Dreams of the perfect Cuban sandwich has been shattered and swept all over La Habanera for now"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is always packed but the feeling is nice a cozy all the same. The serving sizes are small window expect to taste test many dishes to get your fill, but that's a positive in my book. The bill for 2 can get close to 100$ with drinks and a full stomach. Totally acceptable for the quality and attention to detail in the dishes. Every flavours has its place and all work together to make great overall good.

One of my go to spots in Montreal! Check it out."}
{"text":"Espace très sympathique et bien décoré. Il y a beaucoup de détails et de choses accrochés mais au final la somme de tout rend bien. L'ambiance essaye de se caler sur une ambiance sud américaine avec la musique de fond et le reste. 
La bouffe est sympa. J'ai pris une salade d'avocat, bien assaisonné, fraîche et la vinaigrette un peu sucré qui va bien avec.  En plus de cela le riz avec les fèves sont bien épicés et te font transporter à Cuba le temps de quelques coup de fourchette.
Le cocktail était sympa.
Pourquoi 3 étoiles, j'aurais bien mis 3.5 mais ce n'est pas possible. Le service était un peu lent. La fille qui sert à placé ne sert pas à grand chose. Pas de présentation de menu ou autre. Le barman fait ce qu'il peut. 
Les portions sont un peu petites et le prix pas proportionnel au portion. Je comprend le principe de partage de portion mais bon pour une personne 30$ pour un cocktail et 2 petits plats c'est pas un super rapport qualité prix. 
A retenter pour d'autres plats car il y a du potentiel"}
{"text":"Small charming Cuban restaurant. Small sharable dishes. Delicious food! Definitely want to visit again."}
{"text":"They serve tapas so we had the melon salad, the fish tacos, and the Cuban sandwich. All were very well done and quite tasty. Casual atmosphere with lots of obvious neighborhood regulars. We sat outside to enjoy the evening and the atmosphere and the experience was good. 

Service was a little slow, but basically attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing service, tasty food and great mojitos make this restaurant perfect for a night with friends. Make sure to book a table a few days ahead!"}
{"text":"This restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal is one of a few opened by the same owners and offers a Cuban themed menu and decor. 

The venue is bright and nicely decorated with pictures, plants, and neons lights; the colours and decor make you feel like you're in a small venue in Havana. Small space with minimal tables and chairs but they also have comfortable teal  coloured couches for groups as well, that really add that pop of color. 

Having visited many times, I can attest that the menu is inexpensive and yummy. Besides maybe one or two dishes, like the plantain tostadas that are not my fave, they're is not a single other item that I don't like. The Cubans sandwich and fried chicken bao buns are so good but the avocado salad is probably the one thing on the menu I can't get enough of! 

The service is always friendly and attentive; the food always comes out super fast too.

If you are looking for a casual spot with good inexpensive food and amazing cocktails in the heart of the city, go to Habanera!"}
{"text":"A most delightful experience, tucked away on a street of three hip restaurants downtown. Very small, with bar seating and under 10 tables. From the moment we walked in, we were transported and treated like we had gone on vacation. We did the tapas menu with tastings of about half the items on the menu, and left stuffed and beyond happy. The waiter and bartender were friendly and genuinely excited to be there."}
{"text":"This place gets points for the ambiance, impeccable service and delicious drinks but the food is nothing special. The croquetas were bland, the cubano sandwich very ordinary and the pollo a la criola boring. It has so much potential but they really do need to make some changes to their menu...that or lower the prices to match the poor quality of the food."}
{"text":"Popped into this lovely little bite of delight last night and was immediately happy. The bartender was friendly and kind and attentive though hustling, the bites we ordered were savoury and complex and great and though they're weren't a lot of veggie options we ordered them all and it was ok. I made an exception for a fish taco. I wish there was a veggie taco, I know it's not traditional maybe but help me out here! The beer selection could be better with one nice local ipa, and less Sleemans. Really what I loved was the decor and the size and the feeling of being in a dream world far from snow and ice."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place. Went inside with a. Group of 6. They were rude and said \" u have an hour to eat if you want we have reservations at 6:30\". We sat down and they said if everyone was 18. One person in the grouped turned 18 in a month. But he was not going to drink because he can't drink sulfates. They asked us to leave because they only had a bar license. Meanwhile they let a little boy who was 5 years old sit there while there parents drink. So rude. We should've called the cops."}
{"text":"A trendy and fun adventure that Hemingway would be proud of.

Where did this place come from? Doesn't matter, it's awesome. Simply put, the restaurant is small and upbeat and the food is a tapas-style party. Make sure to order the Cubano sandwich, you'll thank me later. Like mojitos? They got you covered with a wide array of types. Every bite was another \"Wow!\" moment. By the way, it's super affordable.

Want a new adventure? La Habanera.

PS, make sure to reserve in advance, especially for more than two people."}
{"text":"First time going to La Habanera was for Poutine week 2017.  The resto is small and cosy with a hipster ambiance.  Seats 6 at the bar.  Kudos to bartender for using really fresh looking fruit for cocktails.  The Poutine de Vaca Frita hadFrites de Yuca, Sauce, Fromage en grain, Mojo VerdeVaca Frita (boeuf), Salade de Coriande.  And I devoured it like I was starving. Yucca fries for Poutine? Who'd of thought!?! It was awesome!!  They were just a touch under but yucca fries have this meaty flavor to them but are light and satisfying.  I frickin love coriander on Poutine and they have opened my eyes to a new way of eating Poutine.  The meat was a little sparse but the bowel was small anyway.  Gravy was tasty and just enough to cover the fries. I left wanting more.  #poutinewin"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré! 

L'endroit est super, les serveurs sont géniaux et vous aideront à faire des choix optimaux (possibilité de prendre un menu \"dégustation\" à 25$ par personne) et les plats sont débiles!!

Nous avons goûté à un peu de tout, en prenant le menu dégustation c'est ce qui arrive! Les crevettes et bananes plantins; c'était délicieux! Les tacos de poissons/mangue aussi! On a pu prendre tout ça avec deux bières et la facture n'était que de 70$ ! Une vraie aubaine !!

Vraiment une adresse formidable et abordable!"}
{"text":"Super cool, small and cosy cuban style restaurant. 
Very original cuban dishes with a twist. 
Little brother of Biiru (japanese) and Escondite next door which I love too (mexican food). Also, they opened a Poke place next door, Koa Lua, which is very good!!!

Overall, we enjoyed our experience here. We went for the first time in december 2017. 

Level of noise is loud so be prepared! 

Price are a bit high but you pay for the \" in \" jetset cool/popular factor.
80$ pour 5 small dishes and one alcoholic drink! 
$$$"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic - and I am saying that even considering that I was sitting outside with construction happening on the street next door! Tacos were outstanding, especially the steak tacos. Drinks were great. Had the Ms Paloma and their twist on a margarita. Would deff go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"It's a cute little Cuban spot in the heart of downtown. I was stopped (just as I was stepping in) by a lady to ask me if I had reservations (which I did). I found that a little aggressive. But rest of the staff were nice and welcoming. I started off with their famous Guava Pina Colada which I really liked but my wallet didn't ($11). From the pictures here, I could guess it's a tapas place. So for food between two people, we ordered chicken bao, chicken creole, spicy beans rice and fish tacos. Chicken bao was ok, a bit on the sweeter side, not what I had expected. Fish tacos were a bit sweet because of the fresh mango slices. So I removed the mango slices and liked it better that way. I kind of liked the chicken creole and the spicy bean rice (decent portion for $4). If you are in the mood to splurge, this is not the place because by the end of your meal you might walk out with a hole in your pocket. It's a good spot for a quick lunch as the service is fairly quick. All in all, it's a decent place but I have had much better Cuban food."}
{"text":"Really cute Cuban place in downtown Montreal. I went with two friends and got the tasting menu for the table ($25pp) which was a never ending parade of absolutely amazing dishes. The avocado and papaya salad was a highlight, as were the fish tacos.

5/5 stars for decor and food, especially for the value.

3/5 stars because our waiter disappeared for like 30 minutes when our meal was done so we were trapped at the table. Also because the mojito wasn't great.

All of that said, would still come back if were in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go with friends after working downtown. It is loud, affordable and the drinks are good. With the decor and gypsy kings music playing n the background you almost feel like you are on vacation. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice. There are hooks under the bar to put your purse and coat. The service was super fast!! We had plans to go to the movies at 7:40 pm so we arrived at 6 pm with no reservations and left there at 7;10 pm. The dishes are meant to be shared and the bartender recommended to get 4-5. I had the mojito of the day which contained pineapple juice, It was very sweet.  I also had a cucumber, rum, vodka, coconut cocktail, which was also very good.  We started with the aguacate (slices of avocado, papaya, cucumber, nougat, and mojito dressing). The waitress recommended it and it did not disappoint.  The waitress also recommended the fish tacos (tacos de pecscada) which were good but honestly I've had better elsewhere. Inside the taco was battered cod with mango ceviche, ginger and pineapple cream and grilled corn. We also shared the Pina Ribs *four (4 good sized adobo pork ribs with maple pineapple and basil glaze). My boyfriend found it spicy and could only eat one but I didn't find it spicy. The meat fell off the bone easily. We also had the Pollo a la Criola (braised chicken, creole sauce and fried onions with a habanero on top. It reminded me of a spicy chicken stew. If you don't like your food spicy don't order this dish."}

{"text":"A nice bistro of Cuban style!! I've been there twice. Food and cocktail were tasty! Ambiance was nice! 
Also, this place is very popular. Better make a reservation before going."}
{"text":"La meilleur bouffe cubaine se trouve probablement à l'extérieur de Cuba!!!! Très content d'avoir essayé ce resto-bar à cocktail qui vient nous réchauffer spécialement à la fin de l'hiver! On y retrouve un menu tapas d'inspiration cubaine ainsi qu'une liste de cocktails maisons assez originale. Pour deux personnes, 4 tapas furent assez pour rassasier notre faim....au choix: tacos, empenadas, sandwich +++ Mon coup de coeur fut le copieux \"El Cubano\"...un sandwich jambon, fromage et moutarde fumée!!!

Mon seul hic est la facture.....92$ pour 2 personnes ( 4 tapas + 3 consommations d'alcool) ainsi que l'absence d'un vestibule à l'entrée....une bonne bouffé d'air froid à chaque ouverture de la porte!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! What a nice find!

I loved my experience at La Habarena.

The restaurant is so beautiful! I really felt like I was in La Havana.

The service was friendly, efficient, and we really felt important as customers.

The cocktails are to die for, especially the sea buckthorn mojito! Wow!! Absolutely delicious.

The food is to die for. Very tasty, well cooked, full of flavours. They are small plates meant to be shared. Expect to order 2-3 per person, or more if you're really hungry.

We had the aguacate salad, it was excellent. The mint dressing was sweet and really brought the avocado and papaya together. Heaven.

The ceviche was good, but perhaps the less impressive of the bunch. Portion was a bit small too, for the price.

The croquetas with smoked meat and cheese were perfect. Gooey and crispy. I'm drooling just to think of them.

The pollo a la criolla was excellent as well. The braised chicken was tender and was melting in our mouth, and the sauce had the right level of spice.

The only negative is that we were hoping to order the pinchos de carne and they had none left.

Overall, a great meal in a great setting. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and welcoming staff, atmosphere makes you feel like you're in a cute Cuban cafe, the mojitos are the greatest!!

{"text":"We had a great time at the 
Habanera last night! We ordered wine and mojitos and lots of different dishes to share. The Papaya salad, aguacate and the bao were the highlights! Great spot downtown to have a drink and a bite!"}
{"text":"Super cute space. Food was disappointing. Undercooked plantain. 5 spice in the chicken doesn't work."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. Terrible service and terrible food. I went for lunch with a co-worker and tried to order the fish tacos. The waiter insisted that we order two dishes even though we only had the appetite for one. So I reluctantly ordered a salad (I think it was called the aguacate?), which was generous in avocado and papaya, but the dressing simply just didn't taste good. Then, 40 minutes later, my fish tacos, which were what I actually wanted (and not just that which I was forced to order), still hadn't arrived. At this point, I asked them to cancel my order and to just give us the bill because we were almost late for our meeting, but in doing so, got some 'tude.  Also, our water wasn't refilled a single time while we were seated.

My friend also didn't enjoy her food. The pâté chinois was sickeningly sweet, and I'm all for experimenting with different flavors and textures, but it was just a weird combination. Overall, so disappointing. I was super excited to try this place out given the Yelp reviews, but honestly, not impressed at all."}
{"text":"This is top notch for Cuban cuisine, especially with the better access of ingredients&spices compared to Havana. Portions are decent: 2plates/person+rice. However, compare to Escondite which uses even privately imported mezcal, I find drinks here a bit overpriced for its quality. And although the decor is beautiful just like their partners: Escondite & biiru, I find the seating way too tight and have to reserve really early.  Over $40/head for food+1 cocktail, I found that the value is not 100% there."}
{"text":"I was brought back for a business lunch and have identified 2 solid items on the menu that I really, really like, and I even returned once on my own after having a really disappointing meal elsewhere, so I feel the need to do an update.

The avocado salad is DELICIOUS, and just about the prettiest salad I have ever eaten. They do such a great job of pairing all kinds of unexpected textures and flavours together! It's quite sweet and it's creamy and filling. The papaya plus the nougat and the nuts are just genius. I highly recommend this.

Their fish tacos are also very nice. They are on the sweeter side because they contain fruit and I actually like it better than the fish tacos next door (though, of course, the golden standard is Seven Lives in Toronto).

I stand by what I said before, but these two items have given me a reason to up the star rating at this place."}
{"text":"I like the decor, the service , the background music , the food and the cocktails 
Habanera is definitely a must to every foodie ...
Shared tapas style menu ....not expensive at all"}
{"text":"let me start by saying that i grew up eating cuban food
my mother being from cuba and me growing up in venezuela blah blah blah
this is definitely not cuban food
believe me
say the word jicama to a cuban and he will look at you as if you had 12 heads
say the word papaya in polite company and get ready to be slapped
as a bonus i will educate you by letting you know in cuba it is called fruta bomba
what it is
something even better
let us call it fusion for lack of a better term 
we ordered the croquetas
ensalada de papaya 
picadillo and ribs
then we could not help ourselves a day had the fish tacos as well
all was really really really good
more than the sum of its parts
amazing
service was spot on
the place is tiny and adorable
celia cruz blasted on the speakers the whole time which made me happy and homesick
make sure to make reservations and have a mojito a mi salud"}
