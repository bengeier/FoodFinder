{"text":"Without a doubt the best Chinese food I have had in Pittsburgh.  Great service, great flavor and a really nice place.  They have an outdoor deck that is great for people that like that sort of thing.  It's a little bit of a challenge to find, but if you know where the Living Room was located, then this is the place!  The restaurant is actually in Bethel Park but the signage is not real great due to the municipa restrictions.  John took the time to stop and chat for a few minutes. Great place, Great food and we will go there again.  It's our new favorite Oriental restaurant in the burgh."}
{"text":"Been a customer of John's for a very long time.  You won't get better Chinese food than his and you won't get better customer service from anyone.  No matter what I've ordered or how I've ordered it, he's ALWAYS been accommodating.  As well as giving us samples of new dishes he's trying out.  We generally get delivery, and his delivery crew has always been courteous, friendly and prompt.  Prices are reasonable and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"i really enjoyed this restaurant.  Does any know anything about the new place.  I cant remember the name."}
{"text":"John is awesome and so is the food he feeds you!!! Everything is always fresh and delicious! The baked salmon appetizer is my favorite, followed by the sushi. Drooling just thinking of it right now. Miso soup is also a must try!"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite of ours. Service was excellent and incredibly prompt. Food was out of this world. The meal started with fried crispies and dip complimentary to the table. We got egg drop soup, wonton soup, sweet and sour chicken and sauteed broccoli none of which disappointed. A few basics to try at a new place and they had the freshest most flavorful tastes. We will absolutely be back soon to try as much of this expansive menu as we can. Clean, inviting, affordable and best of all delicious!"}
{"text":"John's has a huge variety and a cool atmosphere. I can't wait for the warmer weather so I can sit outside on their deck! My personal favorite is the tuna tataki! Yum! The owner, John, is super personable. He always makes sure we have a great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times now, and each time I've gotten what John suggested I try. I haven't been disappointed.  The bento boxes are a sight, and an amazing amount of food. 
The service is impeccable. John himself comes to the table to make sure you're happy and last time we were there, he brought my 3 yr old granddaughter a few crab Rangoon on a plate to try. Just little touches that make an impression. 

I'll be going back. A lot"}
{"text":"I had been wondering what happened to Saigon 88 since I was craving some pad Thai. I stumbled upon johns instead and was very quickly disappointed. We sat down in a booth (only people in the restaurant) and another 10 minutes later our waitress took our order. She brought over some wonton chips in a basket. I picked one up and ate it and noticed there were ANTS crawling in the chips ! We notified the hostess and left immediately."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try Johns because of the reviews but sadly we were seated and after waiting over ten minutes for service or water we got up and left. There were only two tables around us so not busy so no excuse for bad service!"}
{"text":"I was wondering where the old owner of Osaka had gone. It turns out he opened a new restaurant in the heart of the South Hills.
 Any Chinese or Japanese food you could think of and really good quality! Sushi is fresh!They deliver lunch and dinner too!"}
{"text":"Everything I had here my first time was great. Sushi was really well done and the Chinese chicken and brocolli had great flavor. The springs rolls I had here were also the best I have ever had. I only was inside for a couple minutes to pick up takeout but the inside appeared to be nice and clean. Would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for Chinese or sushi."}
{"text":"We are so sad to learn that John's has closed. Does anyone know what happened? Our family loved their soup dumplings and shredded pork with steamed buns. What a loss. John's and family you will be missed!"}
{"text":"This place was remarkably good! I was looking for a place to celebrate Chinese New Year with my wife and chose this place because of all the good reviews. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here based on other yelp reviews and I'm so glad I did! Absolutely the best Chinese food I've ever had, and I used to live in Manhattan. The sushi was also excellent! Service was very attentive and the owner was also friendly. I will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! Their food is fresh, the service is great and it's such a friendly atmosphere. When you get there you won't think much of the outside, but it's gorgeous on the inside. I don't think it's really been discovered by everyone just yet because every time I've gone, I walk right in and get seated. But the owner is so nice, it'll catch on very quickly. My boyfriend and I make an effort to go here every chance we get! I would recommend this to anyone. Their sushi is great, their soups are full of flavor, and their General Tso's chicken is the best I've ever had. The prices aren't outrageous, either which is ALWAYS a plus. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great, so if you're getting takeout, it's probably a good choice. However we had a sitdown meal here and the service was pretty bad. There was only about 3-4 tables of customers, yet it took ages to get anything; drinks, food, initial order, etc."}
{"text":"Not the authentic Chinese food. Most of food are sweet. The waiting time is long, I am disappointed about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my new \"go to\" for Chinese delivery! I had been ordering elsewhere because the meals were $1 or so less expensive but decided to give Saigon 88 a try and it was worth it. Delivery sushi is always a bad idea, but I got a salmon roll and white tuna sashimi and enjoyed them both! I also had combination lo mein, and the hubby got cashew chicken. Everything was very good, the only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took an hour or so to get here, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"John's is one of the best Chinese places I've been to in a while. The inside is beautiful, and the staff is very friendly. They bring crunchy \"chips\", I suppose you would call them, and a duck sauce to the table, similar to how bread would be laid out at an Italian place. Even though these are delicious, do not fill up on them, because the entrees and sushi are great here."}
{"text":"First visit and grabbed a takeout order of soup, egg rolls, General Tso's and fried rice. Two thumbs up.  Best egg rolls ever. Dining room was full and vibrant. Great service. Next time we're coming for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to John's other restaurants before. His attention to detail is awesome and goes out of way to please the customer. We tried the sushi, shrimp pad Thai, and won ton. Everything was very good. John was able to convince my 9 year old daughter to try her first sushi since I've had zero luck. He dressed it up and because of presentation she loved it. I think she is now hooked on seared tuna and sushi rolls. I will be back and next time I'll enjoy the outside deck dining."}
{"text":"John's is, in my view, the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  They do the traditional dishes well, but the strength here the breadth and quality of more unusual dishes they offer. The new Sichuan menu is creative and well-executed:  try the Firecracker Chicken, the Shrimp with Vinegar sauce (which uses aged vinegar, resulting in a fragrant and slightly sweet sauce), and the Sichuan fish.  Also highly recommended are the Hong Kong fish fillet, the Hong Kong curried noodles, and the saut√©ed green beans, which are light and fresh tasting.  I have also eaten my way through the sushi menu (going back to the owner's days running Osaka). You can count on very high quality and well prepared sushi and sashimi, with unique sauces for many of the preparations and careful attention to detail.  

Another  thing bears mention:  John, the owner, is a gracious host who gets to know his customers and will cater to their wishes.  He will make special dishes for children or adults, will recommend new things to try, and also will make dishes not on the menu if he knows what you like.

This is one of Pittsburgh's dining gems.  Introduce yourself to John and you are certain to have a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Greasy, over cooked, and bland. Sorry, I really wanted to enjoy it, but it was awful."}
{"text":"John's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The menu is enormous and I've yet to encounter a single miss, from Americanized standbys (General Tso's) to dishes that would be more at home in a back-alley restaurant in Hong Kong. The sushi bears mention for its beauty alone--I don't know where the sushi chef was trained, but he's an artist.

John himself is one of the nicest and most gracious restaurateurs I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He will honor any and all special requests, recommend new things, and even bring his regular customers new experiments from the kitchen to try (on the house). If you become a regular customer and get to know John, you're sure to get something new and delicious every time you come in!

5/5, Recommended highly."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is so delicious!  We let John give us a chef's choice sushi/roll/sashimi combo and it was fantastic!  He definitely does not steer you astray - Every bite was absolutely amazing.  We also got the fried dumplings, and they were also perfection with a hint of lemongrass in the filling.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We dined in for lunch this time. Still highly satisfied with the service and quality of food. I highly recommend John's!"}
{"text":"I ordered pad Thai and several sushi rolls. The pad Thai was very interesting. It had no peanut flavor to it, just crushed peanuts on top. It also had red and green peppers and onions in it. I've never experienced anything like that before. The lime that was included for it was rotten. I ate several pieces of the sushi and then noticed a string looking piece several parts of the tuna roll. My mind immediately raced. After picking it apart, I've come to the conclusion it looks like a vein? Certainly won't be finishing the roll or getting takeout from there again."}
{"text":"No special request is too special for John.  Even a soy allergy can be handled in this awesome sushi restaurant.  Don't eat shell fish, but still want sushi?  No problem.  John's is the best hands down."}
