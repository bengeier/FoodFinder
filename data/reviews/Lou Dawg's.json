When I tried their free sample at Ryerson frosh week, it tasted really good, I had such high hope for a good pull pork sandwich.
But when I walked into the restaurant at lunch, it's a ghost town - Not a good sign already. We are the only dine in customer, but we have to wait forever for the food. And the portion is tiny. I'm afraid the freebie tasted better than the paid sandwich....."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their space is really gorgeous, nice patio upstairs, and they offer a discount for Ryerson students with ID. The portions are generous, I like the poutine (if it's for 1 person get the smallest they have or be prepared for leftovers!) but I'm not much of a meat-eater (I know, it's a meaty place! I go with friends a lot) so there's not too much I can order. I still highly recommend it for the carnivores out there!"}
{"text":"I have high expectations for Brunch due to the review of my friend.
I would have given 3.5 stars but they had soccer on the T.V. on that eventful Saturday  morning.
Somehow my poached eggs, fruits, and pulled beef tasted better.
The pub and good food mix complete with that combination.
I had to do a lot of explaining of the game to my companions while trying to complete the very filling meal. Normally I am a bottomless pit but became a challenge after a while.

Would I go again is the question?
Of course, the soccer plus food never fails."}
{"text":"From Hawaii, just finished a food tourism trip of the mainland.  The best thing I had, by far, was The Might Loutine (pulled pork poutine) at Lou Dawg's.  I ate most of it with my eyes closed so that I could focus all of my senses on this dish.  It was amazing, especially the gravy.

I split the poutine with the girlfriend and we also ordered the 3 Meat Slider Sampler.  It gives you small pork, chicken and brisket sandwiches.  Throw some 'slaw on 'em if you want."}
{"text":"When this Lou Dawgs location first opened up it was consistently friendly, fresh and delicious. I used to live next door but moved away. I visited Toronto for this St. Patricks Day Monday with friends and I said we MUST go to Lous, told them they'd love it. The bartender seemed to have been drinking on the job, hitting on my friend who was in her boyfriends arms and would often get distracted veeery easily while in the middle of preparing drinks. He also told me why a past bartender was fired which was none of my business. Our food was also stale and mush all at once. What happened? Was embarrassed to have recommended the place to my friends. So many mixed feelings."}
{"text":"BEWARE of their false advertising.  Website pricing is not the same as in the restaurant.  Their poutine was $7.99 a couple weeks ago now $11, when I asked why I was told they had a bad year and the price of meat went up.  Seriously???  Used to go there all the time for poutine, that will be the last time.  Not worth it for that pricing."}
{"text":"When we walked in, it felt like it could be the perfect, casual BBQ spot. I mean, they have 50 on tap. 

There wasn't a server in sight so we settled ourselves down at a table. And waited. And waited. And then waited a little while longer. There were other tables in the restaurant so we were fairly sure they were open. Just as we were about to leave, a server did appear. No apology for the delay which felt kinda weird (would have been sooo easy to acknowledge) but.. onwards.

We both ordered the sliders which was a good chance to try out the different sandwiches. The beef was our favourite, followed by chicken and rounded out by the pork. (I wouldn't, myself, order a full pork sandwich - a bit too bland.) The coleslaw was really heavy on the red onions and the potato salad tasted like boiled potatoes in honey-mustard sauce. Not very delicious. But, back to the sliders, the BBQ sauce really was tasty.

If you're not particular about service or side dishes and you like a pulled meat sandwich, it'd be a good little spot to check out."}
{"text":"I would come here on Monday nights to enjoy their open mic. Love their dry rub wings which are 1/2 off on Mondays. Great sweet potato fries as well. The servers are all friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place!  

This is where I bring my friends when they want to try something new.  I always go to the King W location, just cuz that's closer to where I am - very cozy with a GIANT TV for when the game is on.

I love to get the enormous poutine and share it with a friend.  It's literally one of my favourite things in the world.  The big poutine comes with like, three different kinds of meat, real cheese curds, amazing gravy, and house smoked bacon.  Just writing this review is making me hungry.  

This place is also extremely reasonably priced!  It's a great place for an awesome meal that won't break the bank.  They have a house specialty cocktail and some local microbrews, which is cool.  

They have daily freebies that I think are listed on their website. 

The only downside is that this is NOT the place you want to go if you are on a diet.  Seriously.  The veggie options are pretty sparse.  And sometimes it's a little loud for my taste.

The most important thing, though, is that if you are planning on eating some heart-attack inducing cuisine, THIS is the place to do it right........"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times and we love the food. Best pulled pork ever! This time we decided to go in with a group of 8 to celebrate both of our buddies' birthdays. We all had a terrible night due to the service provided by the waitress. Just so you know, we went on a Wednesday night and it  was hardly busy. She successfully ruined our night with her rude attitude. My other friends have told me that she's been rude to them each time they've been but they brush it off and enjoy the food.

One of our friend vomits in the bathroom with out our knowledge. the waitress comes out freaking at us.Before we even had a chance to apologise she says \" you're cleaning it up, I'm not fucking touching it\". First of all, it's your fucking job. I've been waitressing for years and not once have I ever made the customer clean up their own mess. But we apologise for our friend and proceeded to clean up his mess. We apologised more than three times and each time she acted like a real c-word. So after we settle down, we're enjoying our meals and drinks, she comes by and puts the bill on our table. We weren't even half way done our meal. She didn't even split our bill up. So we go up to her and ask for our bill to be split up . She rudely  says \"I can't split the bill up for you. You either pay for it on one card or all in cash because I'm not fucking wasting my time on 8 people. I have tables to clean.\" First of all, a pos system is suppose to make your life easy. Just push the button and your bill is split easily. Second , it was hardly busy. Thirdly, we didn't deserve that tone, considering we apologised countless times and cleaned up the mess. My friend tells her she knows how to split the bill 4 way and knew who had what. The waitress finally complies, does it while mumbling and shove the bills into my friend's hands. We all didn't leave a tip.  

We've had enough of her attitude. We use to love being at Lou dawg  but this time she really did a great job treating the customers like trash. We're telling all of our hospitality and culinary friends. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and we were the only ones at the restaurant. 

Ordered:
-loutine (pulled pork poutine) 
-meat combo 

I tried the pulled chicken, pulled pork, and beef brisket. I liked all three of them, especially the beef brisket. I liked the taste and texture of it.

The food is good, but the portions are really small for the meat combo. I don't think the meat combo is worth its price since you get a TINY bowl of each meat. You can finish the meat in the meat combo with a few bites.

I will probably not get the meat combos again, but I will get their meat sammies in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty decent restaurant.

I especially enjoyed the brisket and poutine and found the pulled pork and chicken to be a tad dry."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favourite poutine places in Toronto!!! The number of times I've convinced myself that I don't need a poutine from there and I end up getting one is ridiculous. 

Whenever I go there I either get the traditional poutine with beef brisket or angry loutine with beef. I also get their dry rub wings, which are amazing!! I don't know how to describe them, but trying them is a must! 

The staff is super friendly, some of them know me because of the number of times I've been (kinda embarrassing). I always ask for my poutine to be served in one of their bigger baskets that way all of the gravy and cheese is distributed evenly. I also think they'll fill it with more fried even though you are paying for small lol 

Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I ordered here for take out for today's lunch since I forgot to bring mine. I had the fried chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries and a drink. I got back the office, luckily everything was still hot. However, the sandwich was extremely lack lustre, coming from a BBQ joint you expect big flavours. The chicken was very bland and a bit dry to be honest. The coleslaw was run of the mill, the BBQ mayo was good but there was hardly any on the sandwich. The sandwich portion was also quite small, most of the sandwich was coleslaw. The sweet potato fries weren't any better. They were not uniform in shape some were fat, some where small and choppy. Most of the ends were semi-burnt and chewy. Le sigh, I had high hopes but Lou dawgs you let me down."}
{"text":"Yelp, I wish that you did .5 stars, but you don't, so I'm rounding up. Ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and a side of green salad and sweet potato fries. I wish I could deduct the half star because of the pulled pork (probably needs more flavor and a hint of spice), but the coleslaw in the sandwich made up for it. I loved the little pine nuts in the coleslaw - gave it an extra kick. The sweet potato fries were also really good and the portion sizes were generous. If you're a salad person I recommend the dressing - it is a maple vinaigrette and has a nice smoky aftertaste. Thanks to the smoldering blues rock piping through the sound system and the TVs tuned to ESPN, you can almost believe you're in the deep south. Good solid food for a good price."}
{"text":"From the meat menu definitely go for the brisket. Do NOT be shy about exploring the side dishes at all as the substitution for the fries are better than you think and ask for a sample of the side dishes. Great friendly place. Ryerson students get 10% discount."}
{"text":"Lou Dawg's couldn't be more perfect for the area: right on Ryerson Campus, in a location once occupied by Pasta Pappa. PP never appealed to me but wow, Lou Dawg's does. Late hours, seated service or take out and enough variety for any tastes, even things vegetarians!

The first time that I went, i got the beef brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. Every time since then, I've ordered the exact same thing. So boring, I know! But I can't seem to tear myself away from it. The meat is well-sauced and slightly smokey from, ya know, being smoked. It's all very tender on a white bun that holds together while you still get that sloppy joe feel. Use two hands. 

The sweet potato fries are good. They have huge flakes of salt and are tender. It's a little disappointing because who doesn't like crispy-on-the-outside fries? But still, they make for a nice accompaniment to a sandwich. If you want a side sauce, I say go for chipotle mayo. 50 cents extra for refills which I find kind of lame but it's worth it. 

It is at this establishment that I discovered deep-fried pickles! Not really, my friend made me try them. It was my first time so I have nothing to compare them too but as far as I know, they were great. They are sliced in thick, quartered wedges and served piping hot on the inside. The breading stayed on and they had a bite of sourness that was of the perfect intensity. 

Welcome, Lou Dawg's! I hope you are here to stay. Rumor has it that you are opening up a bar up top. I can't wait to see it."}
{"text":"OMG ! The B I G Dawg

No one makes a poutine quite like them.

Thanks!

Under new management is not always the better. Smaller portions ..... the BIG dawg is now the sleepy dog. Oh well old Yeller come out back so we can finish this off."}
{"text":"No biggie.

On the up side when I went there during the Christmas holidays it was super quiet & we got very personable service.

The decor is college student basic - this is not a gourmet establishment.

The food was more than edible, the portions reasonable; an overall all around value."}
{"text":"You would think Lou Dawgs would be cheaper considering it is affiliated with Ryerson and many students from there come here. The beer is very expensive as the cheapest pitcher of beer here is their house beer at $17 before 8pm and $21 after in which taste like you stuck a penny in your mouth (we all did it when we were little). Steam Whistle will ring you up to $23 for a pitcher, the food is bland and boring. Ordered pulled pork and upgraded to sweet fries for $1 extra, to find out on the bill It actually cost $2 extra. The pulled pork was just sliced pork with BBQ sauce on a hot dog bun."}
{"text":"I've had better BBQ but the food was okay.  We ordered the sliders to start and then the 3 meats and two sides.  The waiter could have told us It was basically the same thing.  The waiter was however very attentive."}
{"text":"Came here last night for drinks on Valentine's Day. My friend and I were the only ones in the bar, and the bar tender made some incredible shots. B-52, coffee crisps, and polar bears. 

At some point I must have dropped by wallet, and the bartenders were honest enough to keep it safe until I called in today to pick it up. 

Awesome drinks
Great atmosphere
Safe place
Honest people 

Great place to go and feel well taken care of while having a good time. I forget the bartenders name but props to him. Solid place!"}
{"text":"Visited the Ryerson location last night for dinner, drinks and some American Thankgiving football. I'd been here once before for drinks on their backyard patio (which they close off early due to noise restrictions - kinda lame) but had never visited for food.

Understandably, weekdays can be slower nights (especially as we draw closer to exam season for University students) but to only have 1 bartender and 1 server working, I thought was poor planning as the place was busy and while the server on hand was doing his best, it took a long time for things to happen.

In terms of beer selection, it was fairly standard, however their Lou's Brews (a dark and a lager) were a nice edition and locally brewed at the Molson brew academy. We had a few of these pops, although the lager was very close to a Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue. not spectacular but still pretty good. 

I give them extra points for their drink special last night 4L of draught beer for $25. To do the math on that it's approximately 12 beers, so great value here!

Apparently Lou's is famous for BBQ, specifically for their pulled pork, and lay claim to being the FIRST in Toronto to add pulled pork to poutine. Big claim, but I won't question it, it all tastes good to me! We decided to share the 3 meat + 2 sides between us and for $15+tax it was a steal of a deal. 

I went for the pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket as the meats AND had the deep fried pickle spears and Jalapeno/Cheddar Corn muffin as our shared sides. The verdict:

- Pulled pork, well cooked, good smoke, nice taste
- Pulled Chicken, my favourite of the bunch, great BBQ sauce and tender/juicy
- Brisket, meh.. OK. Some was good and some was not so hot
- Pickle Spears, pretty standard BUT the dipping sauce was great that it came with
- Corn Muffin, rock hard, dry, and had hard nugget of cheddar in it. Could have been better
 
Overall a pretty good experience but a couple of points lost along the way that I think could be easily redeemable if they worked on these areas!

I'd come back if in the area, and I'd recommend it as a cool place to come for some well priced BBQ.

{"text":"Avoid their wings at all cost the dry rub wings have a taste reminiscent of dusty old farts. That are so dry and flavourless they will leave gasping for water as if you had just been in the Saharah for 8 hours.... The sweet potato fries are pretty bomb doe"}
{"text":"Situé à 5 minutes de college station le Lou Dawg's ne paie pas de mine. Le bon plan ici c'est le patio avec 5 grandes tables, le top en été. Allez y en semaine si vous venez en groupe, il y a de la place!

Located 5 minutes away from College station the Lou Dawg does seems like any other bar from the outside. The great thing here is the patio with 5 tables, it is perfect in the summer if you wanna come with a big group of people. Do prefer the week days though, I believe it can get pretty busy on the week ends."}
{"text":"Came here after work last week. Had the pulled pork with fries and mashed. It was okay. Had a pitcher of the house beer as well, for $21!!!!!! My god, thats alot of money for meh beer. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Lou Dawgs has the right decor and the right menu items (save corn bread) for a BBQ joint. Their food is priced very reasonably and the house beer is both delicious and cheap! The brisket I ordered was tender and moist but lacked any smokiness. I wouldn't be surprised if they used a slow cooker. I was a little let down, I was hoping this was the city's hidden BBQ gem.

The service was friendly and prompt, I'd bump up to 3.5 stars if I could. I'd come back for drinks and maybe a snack (or their sandwich shops downstairs). It was rather quiet for a Saturday around 8 pm, but the sandwich shop is open til 4am, so maybe they hit their stride later in the evening.

There is a patio in the background that is open till 11pm."}
{"text":"Very good pulled pork, brisket, and sweet potato fries. Only downside is the original location on King uses superior buns for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place. I frequent this bar a lot, and it's perfect for a cheap pint and greasy food. The bartenders are friendly and welcoming; they remember regulars and work really well together. Occasionally there are some not great people that come in, but the bartenders are great at showing anyone sketchy the door. 
If you go, you should definitely try their Billy. It's a Ryerson drink that's beer, orange juice, rye and amaretto. It's a staple!"}
{"text":"My feelings are mixed about this place. To start off, the food. While I'm not the biggest fan of the whole BBQ  fab (yes, I'm calling it a fab) I did enjoy the chicken and pulled pork alot more than I had thought. I did find it overly sweet which is odd. As a side I had ordered the beans and this is where things went down hill.

Too sweet!

The beans tasted like they were placed in some kind of sugar water. 

However for what it's worth, I did feel full afterwards. 

Service was...slow. I get it, middle of the day, no one really was around. But still, when people walk in at least smile or welcome us in! I came in and sat down for a good while before someone showed up to take our order/bring us a cup of water.

All in all, it's okay. When  it's full of people the air within this place changes for the better!"}
{"text":"Decided to try for the 2nd time today. I ordered the BBQ ribs and a side of well done fries. I also asked for \"light\" sauce on the ribs. The fries were terrible (I think they may have given me sweet potato fries by accident. They were really bad). Hard to describe. The ribs were bad too. Very fatty and chewy and drenched in sauce. I thought that they were a smokehouse and that BBQ was their thing.  Just terrible all the way around. The staff/bar guy was nice however."}
{"text":"I try very hard to avoid the evils of comfort food but every once in a while, temptation takes the better of me and I bite into fattening goodness. My verdict is that Lou Dawg's food is worth getting fat for. 

I don't eat a lot of Southern BBQ and only have Memphis Smoke House near Yonge/Sheppard to compare. That's not a hard benchmark to beat. I ordered a variety of things. I ordered 2 meat + 2 sides (beef brisket + chicken) and a loutine. Man that was a lot of food for ~$20. 

The beef brisket was very tender and flavorful. The chicken was a bit weird in texture but still good. The sauce they use is good. The loutine was well...a poutine with pulled pork. To me, anything on fries will be good. I'm not picky. Lou's pulled pork is infinitely better than Memphis'. Everything was really flavorful in a really heavy and unhealthy sense. 

The only disappointment was the buns. The buns were almost hard. Bread is only good when it's fresh. When it's not fresh, at least toast it or something. Oh well...not a big deal. I came here for meaty greasy food. Not for bread.

I'll return when temptation once againt takes hold of me."}
{"text":"Came here today for la poutine week and the big dawg poutine is pretty awesome. Ordered the large poutine for $15 and the portion was huge! You can share this with 3 people.  Deadly. But the pulled pork was really yummy, sweet and full of bbq flavour. I also like the beans as it added a great texture to the gravy. Gravy was definitely on point. The homemade coleslaw was so delicious and fresh...I only wish they added more of that as toppings to balance off the \"fatty\" ingredients. 

The only problem about this poutine is that it's very filling. I almost knocked out.

Great place. Would definitely come here again to try their other signatures. The menu has a lot of variety and definitely great for late nights. Bar food at its finest."}
{"text":"After hearing about it from my students, I decided to try it out.   Was disappointed by the pulled pork sandwich.  While tender and smelled good, it had very little flavour.  I should have known better after trying southern bbq a few weeks at a great restaurant in Texas.  The staff, while prompt, were foul-mouthed and complaining about kitchen conditions to one another if front of the customers.  Pretty amateur."}
{"text":"Lou Dawg's is a really solid joint. Well located for people coming from different corners of downtown and nicely tucked away from the busy-ness of Yonge. 

Prices are pretty average for the location and the fare is tasty. Pulled pork poutine and 1 lb. of wings was good enough for a friend and I to share; I left entirely satisfied. The dry rub wings are probably the best bet because you get all the sauces on the side so you can choose whichever one tickles your fancy. The BBQ was my dipping sauce of choice. Caveat emptor: one pound of wings here is only 4, so plan accordingly. They're meaty, but not huge. It was the poutine that really filled us up.

Also, half priced wings on Monday and Wednesday! Service was great--friendly, courteous, and decently prompt."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a couple buddies last night for a late dinner. Our waiter was very fast, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. The food itself was really good. I recommend getting their pulled pork poutine as it was outstanding. 

The decor and layout of the restaurant was really good, the only thing is for non-smokers the bar is located close to the back of the restaurant. Therefore those who go to smoke consistently walk past all of the tables to get back and forth from the bar."}
{"text":"PULLED PORK OVER EVERYTHING, PULLED PORK ON MY MIND. 

I've had the pulled pork sandwich before - for $6 it's pretty small and meager.  The pulled pork poutine however (\"Loutine\") needs to start it's own religion. I'm not a big fan of poutine (unless if it's from Smoke's) since it's usually really dry with fries and gravy, but damn! I'm not sure if it was the pulled pork or the gravy that sinks to the bottom, or the hot perfectly-sized and perfectly-textured fries, this dish just hit the SPOT. It doesn't have as many toppings (aka DIMENSIONS) as Smoke's but if you're coming to Loudawg's you'd better get the Loutine!

I had a small potato salad on the side, as it looked really good in the pic. But the dijon mustard sauce had the spiciest mustard seeds which made my nose sting every now and then! The potato chunks were also not as cooked as I'd have liked them to be and had no flavour beyond the outer layer. 


Pros
- LOU
- TINE
- Friendly staff!
- When you go to the second floor entrance, look up at the creative lighting! ;)
- open til 4am EVERY DAY. 
- Great greasy hangover food


Cons
- Small selection of items on menu
- Not too sure what they're good for apart from pulled pork. 
- Dry rub wings is right - they are DRY. Wasn't very flavourful, though it smelled amazing.

Would def come again on a fat day."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for drinks and some light appetizers. Lou Dawg's was the perfect spot for us to hang for a few hours since they are located like three or four short blocks from our hotel - Ramada.

Seriously love this place and our waitress was super nice and all about smiles. That's white glove customer services! 

My brother and I had three glasses each of their steam whistle beer. Oh boy, we had a nice buzz after. 

If you are looking for a more fruity cocktail with less alcohol, try ordering the frozen breeze. My mom had two of those was she was satisfied. 

For appetizers, we ordered their sweet potato fried pickles! 

Lots of big screen television and seats, there is also a downstairs for lunch or dinner.

The prices were amazing! We had a great time, good discussion with the family and super affordable."}
{"text":"I'd imagined this place would be packed during the school year since it's right across the street from Ryerson [insert warm campus memories here]. But on a cool summer Saturday night, it was oddly empty. They also open until 4am every day, great for after-hours munchies or the like.

The Ryerson Low Dawg's is divided into two levels: the lower floor is just a takeout joint, and the upstairs is the full bar and table service. You can get to either level from the outside or from the inside stairs. Nothing to say about the basic campus bar decor, other than that the lights do have a weird tendency to flicker at times. Washrooms are crammed and small; don't say I didn't warn you about opening the door to a wall and not knowing which way to turn.

There was probably like two people staffing the whole place, so service is minimal--great if you just want to be left alone catching up with old friends in a quiet campus bar. Not great if you actually want something, even if you and your pals are the only one in the house.

I was warned about the Loutine. I am a sucker for anything pulled pork and poutine, so to put them together, fuck yeah it better be good.

Except the Loutine didn't make me wanna cry hallelujah. \"Meh\" would be a better adjective. Good enough to make your stomach shut up and smile, but not as impressive as anything from Smoke's.

Their beer selection is limited to mostly a handful of big industrial brands. They do have a couple house brand brews, but they are nothing special--I was warned also that the Low Dawg's Lager is kind of like Molson, and trust me, it is good stuff only if you consider Canadian to be good stuff. Moreover, they have an even more limited veggie option.

If you just wanna eat something from here, you're better off heading downstairs for takeout.

{TTC: the 506 to Church Street and then a walk south to Gerrard would probably the the shortest transit option.}"}
{"text":"I'm not from Texas, so I don't have high standards for BBQ, but this was pretty bad. In NY, even the sub-par BBQ places have smoke rings. The brisket and pulled pork tasted like my messed up attempts at BBQ, that I tried at home to make BBQ meat in less than an hour. It was really dry and chewy. 

I have to admit though, the BBQ mayo was pretty good.

P.S. Toronto-ers: If you disagree, try Might Quinn's, Fette Sau, or Hill Country in NYC (my benchmarks)."}
{"text":"The food is kind of expensive for fast food, but at least it tastes good!  I don't like spending $15+ for lunch. 

I think they have changed their buns since the last time I went.  I like the baguette style.  The fish sandwich is really good, and the corn and bean salad is my favourite side.  The portions are pretty good.

I love the corn bread muffins!"}
{"text":"I come here with friends today. I ordered the chicken pulled for 9.95 which come with the sandwatch only if you want to order fries it is an extra of 2.99. The burger was good but I will recommend the pulled pork sandwatch instead as it is cheaper and taste better. I got steam whistle and the house beer both are similar and good I will recoment both. The place is nice with clean washrooms. It is not a crazy bar with many drunk weirdos. So if what you looking for I will recoment this place. Definitely not the bet around but it is not bad either ."}
{"text":"I live somewhat nearby so I come here quite a bit when I'm feeling like getting some greasy stuff. Their signature pulled pork sandwich is good, but it doesn't particularly stand out compared to other places in my opinion. The poutine here however, is something else. I don't really like the taste of poutine very much, but for this place I make an exception.

The only thing about this place is it's quite small inside and can be a bit crowded at times, so it isn't really the best place to hang out with your friends on a Friday night, but you'll definitely find yourself coming here for your hangover food."}
{"text":"Met the general manager late on a Sunday night. Great guy, very genuine. Due to my profession I am in a lot of cities every night so it's refreshing to see and meet a guy who genuinely cares about customer service. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this place because of the good reviews I saw on Yelp. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super nice, so I was feeling good about this place! Then the food came. I got the wings with dry rub, and the rub was super grainy and a weird texture. They didn't have ranch dressing (what!?) so I tried a few of their  wing sauces for dipping. They were not bad but not remarkable. 

All in all, the atmosphere is cool but I would definitely recommend trying something other than the wings."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time in a while. Ordered the beef brisket sandwich and a pint of the house beer. 
Pros:
I recall last time I was there the pulled pork was a little dry, but no such problem with the brisket. No complaints about the beer.
Cons:
Still no sides included with the sandwiches. $12 feels like a little much for just a sandwich, especially of that size."}
{"text":"I like this place! I've bookmarked this restaurant for the longest time but I never think of coming here for dinner. They have two locations and one of them is quite close to the Eaton Centre which makes it a perfect dinner destination after a day of shopping.

I won't lie, I had super low expectation for this restaurant because it seems like there weren't that many great reviews for it. Also, when I went into the restaurant, it was dead. 

My friend ordered pulled chicken and beef brisket with fries. I was shocked by the amount of flavour packed in each dish. I ordered the pulled pork chilli. You wouldn't think it'll be filling just by looking at it but I couldn't finish the meal! It was a good consistency and they didn't skimp out on the pulled pork.

As I'm writing this review, I realized how much I miss this restaurant and I need to go back there soon!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. Food is okay, we got the chicken & cheese chilli, pulled pork sandwich, pulled pork loutine, and the meat platter with brisket plus mashed sweet potato and beans. No one was over impressed by the food. My meal (chilli) i suspext was just microwaved...  It was a little hotter than lukewarm and very watery. 

The vibe here seems very chill, maybe too much. I say this because you can't really tell who works there or not. Also another waiter at the table next to ours kept sitting down with the 2 patrons and watching the game playing on the TV."}
{"text":"On my way to another food joint down the street, I walked by Lou Dawgs and noticed, for the first time, that they have a fast order sandwich shop in the basement! Score! I hate having to order over the phone for restaurant takeout and then be the person awkwardly sitting in the bar waiting by myself. 

I was the only customer on a Friday at lunchtime. Took a look at the menu and asked what was the most popular (\"pulled pork\"), but I make a mean pulled pork myself, so I went for the brisket sandwich. The guy behind the cash (who also was the only person there) asked me if I wanted it done po-boy style and I said yes, not realizing til afterwards that it was an extra charge to basically have coleslaw put on top of the sandwich on a different bun. Oh well. 

With a drink and fries, the whole thing came to $19, which is pretty steep for lunch in the core for one person, but there was a LOT of food that could have easily been split between two moderately hungry people. The brisket was tender and tasty and the coleslaw upgrade? Definitely worth it, though I'm not sure if the standard sandwich comes with it (I'm thinking no based on the menu). Fries were super tasty and a large portion! Overall, great food, decent price.

One thing, the guy behind the counter could have been friendlier. I'm your only bloody customer and you can't be bothered to keep up conversation with me while I pay and wait? And I'm not talking taxing stuff, just asking about the restaurant, their food, etc. You think they'd want to try a little harder to get and keep customers coming back. I'll be back to try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Beef brisket is tender, moist and flavourful, so the uninteresting bun is not a big deal.

The pulled pork while decent, is not as good as the brisket.

For sides, the meaty beans is a must... and if you are a fan of sweet potato fries, avoid them here, they are soft, mushy and burnt!  

The best thing about this place is they are open late, so a great place for the late night munchies!

They have Karaoke on Tuesday nights which seems popular with the Ryerson students.

Can't speak to the dining experience, we always do take out since we already liked the food from eating at the original Lou Dawgs on King West."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I came her for lunch and got The Mighty Loutine and it was so good! It is a twist on poutine - with fries, cheese curds, pulled pork, pickled jalapenos, crispy onions, and chicken gravy. Next time I'd get even more jalapenos. It. Was. Delicious.  I ordered the small and could not even begin to finish it (and I have a healthy appetite). I'd highly, highly recommend this place.

Service was good, food came fast, ambiance was laid back."}
{"text":"One server for the entire top floor + bar = SLOW SERVICE. We had to catch a movie so we pretty much left hungry. We came with our Joylister Poutine Passport and recieved a \"half size\" Loutine. It was tiny. So tiny I was hungry again in 2 hours (we went to Five Guys, YAY!).

I really wanted to order more food but there was no time as it took 10+ minutes (and only because I approached the bar after patiently sitting at our table) before we could be put our order in and another 15 before we got our poutine. To get the bill and pay was another 5-8 minutes. That's 30 minutes for the things other restaurants can get done in 10 minutes. This is not the servers fault but managements. Our server was as good as he could be considering he had to wait on groups of people, plus people at the bar and deliver food to each table.

They were also out of a couple of beers. On a Tuesday.

The Loutine was fine but was soured by the whole experience. The size was equivalent to a snack size, probably half of a small...which is extremely cheap on their part.

Side note: Joylister was great about our concerns about the size of the poutine offered here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! 
I've been having more than my fare share of pulled pork recently! It's probably for the same reason that after the (very friendly) dude behind the counter recommended the beef brisket as the best sandwich, I had to ask if he was sure...
I ended up ordering both pulled pork and the beef brisket sandwiches and sharing with a friend. The fellow behind the counter was right, the brisket is simply amazing! Perfectly cooked, very tender and mouth wateringly juicy! The pulled pork was also alright, but not even the best one I had tasted within the same week!
The fries are also excellent. Very crisp and nicely cut. 
The sauces available make the cut and the service was the best part of the meal next to the brisket.

The only bone to pick so far is the fact that I definitely left a bit hungry and was hoping for a slightly more substantial meal!

Don't make the mistake I did; go for brisket!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, for lunch take-out. I ordered the brisket sandwich based on other reviews. Overall, pretty tasty. But, for almost $10 with no sides, way too much for what you get."}
{"text":"Generally love this place but went recently and wound up with food poisoning from the pulled chicken salad.  (We ate almost everything on the menu as we do, but me and one other bud shared that salad and would up ill a few hours later).  Tried to call to  warn them but they don't answer the phone - left them a YELP message here, and no reply.  :~("}
{"text":"If you're into BBQ, give this place a miss. They were good when they started on King West but now all the alleged BBQ items are pretty much just reheated by low wager who don't care, it's quite common to be served cold food drowned in sugary sauce. Even the jalapeno cornbread has gone unquestionably downhill."}
{"text":"I went to Lou Dawg's the other night (into the new bar section) with a table of 8 around 10pm. We had just went to see a show, and were all hungry and eager to order our meals. Having all been there at least once before, we knew what we wanted to order going in the door.

We sit down at a table covered in empty glasses and used napkins and stacked everything to the side so that the waitress would be able to pick them up easier. After sitting at the table right in front of the bar for 15 minutes the waitress came over and removed the dishes not saying a word, and not offering to wipe down the sticky beer covered table. 

Another 5 minutes rolls around and the same waitress comes back and says \"what can I get you all to drink\". We told her that we wanted a pitcher of beer and a water and that we were actually ready to order our food (because we had already been seated for 20 minutes). She said \"sorry guys I need to get the drinks first then come back and take your orders or I wont remember everything.\" ...umm then get a note pad?

The waitress then goes over to the bar and proceeds to flirt it up with the men sitting at the bar and about 10 minutes later she brings us our drinks. We have now been sitting for half an hour. She then says \"so are you all getting food?\" We tell her yes and she says...\"ok wait a minute I need to get a note pad.\" REALLY we told you already we were all getting food. 

She finally takes our orders (thank god the kitchen is fast) we got our meals another 10 minutes later. As we are eating our meals, this same waitress then proceeds to TAKE HER SHIRT OFF and start dancing in front of the live musician....ok we know at this point you are eager for tips from the men at the bar...but come on, the rest of us don't care about you trying to get attention, you just look like an idiot.

We finish our meals and it's time to pay. We asked the waitress to split the pitcher 4 ways and who she needed to bill for it. She goes \"really guys?\" my friend (having worked at a bar before) said to her \"I've used the same computer system as you, I know a pitcher can be split with the push of a button.\" The waitress rolled her eyes and about 10 minutes later brought us our bill and in a snarky voice said \"this is the best Im doing for you\" (really?! you are the worst waitress ever, extremely slow and now you're being sassy). She had split the pitcher...but put it on the bills of the wrong people.

 At this point we didn't care to correct it...and figured the waitress wouldn't have enough brain capacity to fix the problem, so we paid the incorrect bills and left.

Let's just say the extra tip money that she may have gotten from the men at the bar would balance out with the zero tip money we left at our table of 8..."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with the wings here. The meat was soggy and unfresh. I eat wings and chicken a lot and I can tell if it's fresh or not. The wings I had must have been freezer for a while. Really disappointed and won't go back."}
