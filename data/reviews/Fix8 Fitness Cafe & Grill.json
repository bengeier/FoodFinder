{"text":"I've been coming to this place often and when I first started eating here the food was really good so it kept me coming into eat. The past few times I've came in the steak has been cold and not as good as it used to be. Definitely will not be spending my money here or recommending to anyone else"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The service is fine.  They dont always get the orders right, but I have never disliked anything I recieved there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their meal prep plans are also amazing to check out! Especially when you're having a lazy Sunday and decide to simply binge watch game of thrones for instance and then realize you cooked/prepared absolutely nothing for the weeks lunch menu... Perfect fallback! Boom!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner after our workout and we finally got to try fix8 after driving past it every time we go to Starbucks lol... She had gotten the mango salmon with brown rice and I had the barbecue chicken with brown rice both came with salads and we shared a chocolate peanut butter and I think banana was in there too anyways everything was really really good had lots of flavor and tasted very fresh, kinda pricey but well worth the value and when has healthy food ever been cheap lol."}
{"text":"Worst salad ever. The lettuce was dark and slimy. The avacado was hard and basically green as can be. I will never eat here again. The price are so overrated for the sad quality food you get."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place a lot. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. The steak is phenomenal, especially the garlic steak. Great flavor and tender."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. There garlic steak is amazing And the acai bowls are definitely the best in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Bummer. The smoothie part of the bowls is premade and frozen.  Instead of banana on top as advertised, they put canned pineapple. Wish I had read the reviews before coming.  Definitely won't be back. :(  (my 4 year old was impressed though, so 3 stars)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile, but not impressed with the new owners.  I called in a meal prep order on Saturday for pickup on Monday. Called on Monday to see if it was ready and was told \"they messed up a lot of orders from Saturday. Your order isn't ready and I don't have everything I need to make it. I would need to substitute some items.\". No biggie, I ask if I can pick it up on Tuesday with the correct items. No problem, they said.  I get a text on Tuesday, \"Your order is ready for pickup\". When I arrived they told me they had to substitute out the sweet potatoes and broccoli since they ran out.  I asked to speak to the owner (who was there) since I specifically waited an extra day so there wouldn't be substitutions. The girl at the counter talks to the owner (I can hear what's going on). He refuses to come out to speak with me, blames it on his staff, and tells her to refund my money. I immediately felt bad since I could tell from that interaction how poorly the owner treats his staff.  If you're going to substitute things, call and ask, it's not that difficult. More importantly, there is simply no excuse to berate a staff member where a customer can hear you nor to refuse to talk to the customer when a mistake was made. This food is not cheap. For the price paid, I expect far better."}
{"text":"Garlic Steak Salad with Balsamic Dressing and a peach smoothie were both terrific. Only in town for a few days but will be back in the morning to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Good clean food! The garlic steak was delicious! My fianc√© ordered the Acai bowl 4 out 5 for her! Mother in law hates healthy food and loved the steak and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great healthy food here. Every time! It is so hard to find a place to eat when on the go, but Fix 8 cafe is your place. It is nutritious and tastes great."}
{"text":"Update!!!! The price of vegetables must of went up... Get 2 scoops of rice when the pics on the menu clearly show it come with veggies..... And the salad was. Lets just say the salad was sad.. 3 people came to $47. Lil pricey for what you get..be carefull.. you will get charged extra for garlic when the menu clearly shows its the same price."}
{"text":"I would on any other occasion give this place a 5 star rating but tonight's experience was very disappointing.  I looked online at their menu and decided on a steak wrap. $8.95. I called and ordered and drove down to pick it up. When the girl rang me up it came to $12. I asked why and apparently the wrap was actually $10-something. I told her that she needed to update the prices online and she kept repeating that she didn't know they had a menu on their website. If you work there maybe you should know that kind of thing. Anyways, I drove back home and opened my container. They had forgotten to give me salad dressing for my side salad. And the poor wrap was so small I became angry that I had paid $12 for it.  I tried to call them when I was done eating. I had ordered late so I called them to let them know about my experience about 5 minutes before they closed and no one bothered to pick up the phone. Guess they closed early.  I usually get a steak meal and it's always delicious. Take my advice and avoid the wraps. Also, to the management, please change your prices online to reflect those that are in the cafe."}
{"text":"I went into fix8 because I was excited about eating A healthy lunch as there aren't too many good options in the area. I walked in and the girl behind the counter was very rude. Trying to order asked if there any gluten free options she said there weren't any she acted very annoyed. I decided to order a chicken salad. After paying $11 for it with a $.50 credit card charge which I was not informed about,  I sat down at a table and noticed the disarray of the lobby. When my salad arrived I was very disappointed. I have paid $11 for a salad it looked worse than when I can make for myself at home. The tomatoes weren't ripe, they were practically pink yellow, the avocado was hard and there were only two three slices, the cucumbers were old and slimy. The chicken...... the chicken was sliced so thinly and over cooked so badly I almost didn't even eat it. I was considering this place for meal prepping but after my experience today I don't think I will ever be back!"}
{"text":"Love fix8! I have been getting my meal prep here twice a week for the past 3 months and have lost 41 pounds. Very healthy options and the food is great. Lorena is the best she is always super helpful. She make sure my meals are always ready quickly and my order is correct . Her customer service is awesome, I always feel like I am taken care of (love the personal attention!) The garlic steak is a must (sooooo good). I highly recommend fix 8! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the containers they come in are reusable. The only down fall about the restraint is how expensive the food is. One plate was $15 and it didn't even include a drink. If you can afford something like this often I say go for it. It's healthy food and they also have meal plans for a week."}
{"text":"Great place for a good nutritious meal. Not a lot to it. The salmon salad is great. I wish their hours were earlier so I could grab breakfast there on the way to work."}
{"text":"This place is right near my house so when I'm craving food and don't feel like cooking this is my go to. Their food is phenomenal and I think we'll priced for the amount of food you get! Wish their were more around town"}
{"text":"The good: Food was good and they had lots of options. Great place if you're on a clean diet and they also have meal plans you can order for portion control when ur feeling too lazy to do meal prep or if you're traveling.  The lady that greeted us was very nice and answered all of our questions.  The bad: The meathead behind the counter that helped the customer before us seemed uncomfortable helping a gay couple and didn't even acknowledge us to the point that he walked away when it came to our turn at the register. Seemed odd. There was also a lil kid on roller shoes skating all around the customer area & the kitchen. Seemed  unsafe b"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place maninly because their delivery guy keeps coming by to my work. Call me intrigued, I've been three weeks on a diet and working hard to slim down.    I ordered the 4oz Garlic Steak with brown rice and baslamic vingrette. The steak was wonderful very well flavored, not a bit of fat or gristle either. I am glad this place offers brown rice because nutrionally it's a better choice than white and of course the salad greens a nice touch with the protien and rice. I am happy this place exists.   Slight con: Trying to call them to order is difficult. Apparently their phone line gets slammed for deliveries because when I try to call all their lines are full. I guess this place is really that popular with the locals."}
{"text":"Always solid food and customer service. A little pricey but well worth the convenience of good, clean eaying on the go."}
{"text":"Amazing health food! Love it and can't wait to go back. side note- why do people rate based on something the business has no control over? Haters lol Fix8 awesome people and awesome food."}
{"text":"My son talked me into stopping to eat here. So glad we did. It was fantastic!! We thoroughly enjoyed the food! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have seen the sign for this place several times as I  frequently go to \"Starbucks\" for coffee. I was down at the \"Care Now Clinic\" today and was a little hungry afterwards so decided to try the place.  I ordered a \"Garlic Steak Wrap\", the woman that rang me up was pleasant and somewhat helpful. She told me that the wrap came with greens inside and a side salad. I chose ranch for my dressing for my salad, (not that great or fresh!)  I got the order to go, (as I live in Boulder City) as there are no healthy options in town. When I got home I was a little disappointed in the meal. For one, the greens are not really fresh and some were brown on the edges and others were just soggy and rotting. Really unpleasant, considering how much I spent on the meal, $14.30 that including a Bai iced peach tea!  Not sure if I'll be back, unless they decide to do something about what they call fresh!"}
{"text":"Nice area and good service but Acai in the bowls were not fresh. Instead, it was frozen and was not too tasty either."}
{"text":"Mango salmon hit home for me. Lots of side choices. Definitely coming back again. Also got 6x meal prep."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. We go here for dinner about 4-5 times a week. Mostly because we have been working late and there's no time to cook dinner once we get home. I always get the steak and mushrooms with asparagus and broccoli. It's the best!!"}
{"text":"If you want good healthy food this place is great! Prices are great considering the amount of food you get. Most places can't do brown rice right but this place can! I got the grilled chicken plate, and it was excellent! I wish there where more places like this in Henderson!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, only reason it received 4 instead of 5 stars is the acai bowls aren't too good. However, if you're looking for something healthy, quick, & financially worth it Fix8 gets the job done!"}
{"text":"It can be difficult to keep a special diet while dining out, but cooking at home can get boring. What to do? Head to Fix8. No, they don't make anything mindblowing that you can't make yourself, but they offer a variety of flavorful and well-made proteins that prove \"healthy\" doesn't have to be bland or boring.  The garlic steak is the most-recommended dish in these reviews, so it was the first thing I tried- and it lives up to the hype! Nice char, intense garlic flavor, perfect topped with added mushrooms. I wish I could specify medium-rare, as it was a bit dry compared to my preference.  Fresh produce is used, and cooked to retain flavor rather than steamed to death sans seasoning.  Will come back to try the chicken or fish dishes. Menu also offers shakes and poke bowls, wish they would add some more creative salads. Service is quick and the positive vibe really makes this place shine.  NOTE: You can sub salad for the rice on the plates, but make sure you clarify that you still want the vegetable. I received only mixed greens with my steak! :("}
{"text":"Tried the chicken with peanut sauce today. It was yummy. The garlic steak with mushrooms was still delicious. Same for the kimchi.   I had the same issue though with not getting my salad even though I was very clear that I wanted the asparagus as a side and not part of my meal and again, the person taking the order asked what type of dressing I wanted on the salad. I partially blame myself for not checking my boxes before I left.  So, the food is great. My only advice is be sure to check your order for completion before you leave. (Unlike me, lol)"}
{"text":"Just a quick update.  As of writing effective now.  NEW: Owners  NEW: now open on Sundays!  NEW: OPEN til 9pm NEW: Protein: added 6oz choice NEW: choice of salad and now veggies!  NEW: Choice of rice and now potatoes!  NEW: on UberEats!   LIKE: CHOICES for potatoes, sweet or white potatoes   LIKE: CHOICES for veggies, asparagus, zucchini or mixed   NOT crazy about the prices charged or the change of packaging in Styrofoam instead of plastic containers. But I get it..to cut costs, but lunch here is pricier now. Still good eats though!"}
{"text":"After running around looking at potential houses getting some nutritious food is a MUST. This place is definitely the spot for dinning out and keeping up with clean eating.  The food is really tasty as well. Thanks Fix8!!"}
{"text":"Mmm, no. I had tilapia, asparagus, rice, and a smoothie. The atmosphere here stank. The sound of mixers running is anything but soothing. It's worse than espresso machines, and there was a tv mounted and blaring in one corner. Sterile interior, naked walls, am I in a hospital cafeteria?   The seasoning on the fish was tasteful, but the texture dry. Rice was devoid of taste. Asparagus, I don't even remember. Relatively healthy, but otherwise uninspired food. I actually started this review several months ago, but the experience was so forgettable that it just got lost by the wayside. There are much better healthy fast-food options in this city, so take the time to find'm."}
{"text":"great had the garlic steak with mushrooms,  if I lived in the area I would go all the time"}
{"text":"Love this place! I get meal prep when I'm doing my fitness challenges and go get lunch there all the time.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food was very good and fresh.  I got the small portion of the garlic steak with broccoli and could only eat half of it! the staff was friendly and place was clean... but they do charge a 2% fee for using a card, so make sure you bring cash!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot, the food was great and it was nice to have a healthy option. Always was a pricey meal but I thought it was worth it!   I typically order the same thing every visit: garlic steak, brown rice, broccoli . My last visit here was disappointing to say the least, not only did they change their to-go containers to styrofoam, but my garlic steak was dry but also plain as hell.  Once I opened the box everything was tossed around and blended together because of the room inside a styrofoam container; never used to have this problem!!   I used to think the cost was at least worth it because you received a nice to-go container you can keep and the food was delicious. I have been faithful to fix 8 since they opened their original location on horizon and horizon but now unfortunately I need to find a new healthy eatery ...    A $12 meal (without drink!!!) should not look or taste the way it did"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I eat at fix8. Adore the lady that works in the afternoon. She was very patient and helpful when my mom asked for clarity. Great staff, great food, great price."}
{"text":"After several prepped meal orders I have decided it's time to give up. Every time order a single meal it's always lean meat and delicious. However, the prepped meals are so fatty and often undercooked I can't even eat it. I was super excited to find this place but have decided to give up."}
{"text":"The people seemed friendly and all but paying almost 10$ for a regular sized mango smoothie with protein fruit and ice. Yikes."}
{"text":"I don't know how they have been open since January and I didn't find them until July... *sigh*  I am, however, EXTREMELY happy I found them. I work in old Henderson and I don't really eat fast food anymore, so the food options are limited. I honestly usually just hit up the grocery store for some fruit and chicken - but that ends up getting tired.   I couldn't decide what to eat one day, so I entrusted yelp to help my search.   I entered and was greeted right away, no waiting, no hassle. My first time there, I was explained how the menu works and placed my order. I got the garlic steak, 4oz portion with one scoop of rice and subbed broccoli for the usual salad.   YUMMMMMMMMY! Seriously, I am pretty much addicted. I ended up going there 4 times in 2 weeks. I am there enough that I don't really need to say my order, just confirm that I don't want to change anything about it.   I stick to the garlic steak, most of the time - it's just THAT GOOD. Last time I tried the Thai Peanut Chicken along with the steak, that was pretty good, too - but the garlic steak still remains my favorite.   The staff is all super nice and the place is small, but adequate. It's kept very clean and comfortable. No qualms there. I've only eaten in once with my work group, service was great and everyone left happy and full. Everyone loved what they ordered.   I usually get my food to go, and it's always a quick and hassle free experience.   If you're looking for fresh, new and delicious - definitely come here!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We went in for lunch service was great food was amazing. Portions were perfect.  The only reason for 4 stars was later that day I ordered my dinner to take to work. I placed everything online. I ordered my food at 2pm for 230 pick up. It wasn't ready at 230. I had to ask for my shake. When I got to my car  I opened the box everything looked great. But I was missing my ranch so I  to go back into the store. I walked out at 240 when it was all said and done. I was concerned because I had to be at work by 3."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! there are no HEALTHY (& tasty) options on THIS SIDE of town. We need this place!! The blazing steak & mushrooms with brown rice is my FAV!!!! Please support this place!!! Try it & u will be pleasantly surprised at how delicious AND healthy it is!!! Mango salmon is also a great choice (when mango salsa is in season)"}
{"text":"Extremely delicious and highly addictive. I've eaten here a handful of times and it's really good. This place was given 4 stars only because of the pricing. I get it, delicious food that's actually healthy, but still!!! It is very expensive"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night. Aside from the food not being good, or cooked all the way, my smoothie was forgotten. I asked the delivery driver about my smoothie and he said, \"sorry call the store.\" No one answered.  I've tried calling 4 times today, still with no answer. Hoping a bad review will allow me to get their attention so I can be refunded for the smoothie I never received. :/"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! We're on a driving trip and we're thrilled to find this on yelp. Quick, delicious, healthy meal. Tons of options!! Clean eating! I wish this place was everywhere for a fast food option!!!"}
{"text":"I'm all about trying out new healthy places, so when this place opened up i was excited! There is not much like this place on this side of town! My boyfriend ordered the steak wrap and fell in love, as did i with my Korean chicken. The food was very flavorful, I like that there is a nice variety in protein, carbs and vegetables. There is tons of ways to switch it up here. I do believe they serve smoothies as well but i haven't tried them, definitely will soon tho. This place is all about well balanced meals. Simple yet delicious. Doesn't seem like you can go wrong with what you order. This isn't a hit or miss kind of place. Everything taste good and is good for you too. The only downer is the drink selection, wish they had better healthier options. Still this place is 5 starts for me."}
{"text":"Great food! Great owners.. they're here to help you with your meal prep or just a quick lean meal! Great options for a very well balanced high protein meal.. love the steak and sweet potato options.  Do yourself a favor and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Went to this spot one night when in the area and looking for a healthy option.   Im kinda a workout type who generally likes to eat pretty clean and this place definitely satisfies my needs. I went with the chicken and salmon, brown rice and veggies. All were very tasty.   The two young ladies working were friendly and made good recommendations. The restaurant is clean and welcoming.   I also noticed that they offer healthy meal preparation service if that's something you're in the market for.   I'll definitely be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Amazing poke bowls!!!!  And acai bowls!!!  Brown rice and seasoned poke bowl is a great post workout meal!  The acai bowl comes with banana and granola. The perfect healthy dessert!  So thankful for this place so we don't have to cook all the time!"}
{"text":"Talk about healthy options!! I have never been to the old location so this was my first time. It little out of the way for me but by the time left well worth the time. Sure you have the Green and Protein, Protein House, and missed few all the same concept. The thing that stood out for me was freshness, nice portion size (option of either 6 or 8oz for your choice  of protein), and lots of options that can mix and match. I went with the korean chicken with white rice and salad. I was little surprised the style of korean chicken cause am use to heavier sauce and more times then not use chicken thigh meat. My surprise turned into culinary delight! The chicken breast was cooked on point. Nice and moist. The sauce believe when you choose the style they add the sauce on top of the chicken. The korean sauce had nice flavor with tiny kick of spice. Not big brown rice guy so went with white rice. The salad has a nice assortment of organic greens. You get to choose the salad dressing want with the salad. Not your plain chopped romaine, head lettuce, or basic greens. It was awesome compliment fill out the box. BOX or rectangle. It reminding me lot of ZipPac my local 808 peeps would catch that reference. I loved the fact you had two scoops of rice., protein, and then salad or believe vegetables. It really the perfect healthy well balance meal. The combinations are mind boggling. If any of the other options are as tasty no doubt going make the long drive out more often then not. The poke style bowl they sound tasty. They do have some pictures of few dishes just in case unsure which direction want to go. It might be overwhelming with all these options but truth be told simple pick your protein, starch, and then side. I think there no really bad options just healthy, fresh, and good ones.   The decor is the only thing that blah. Since it just open I believe from reading other reviews so maybe not done. Right now nothing much just few tables outside the counter you order, nothing on the walls, one television (that believe was off or not working), and the fountain station is kind of off in the corner.   The service was awesome! Lady at the counter explained the whole process clearly and went over all the options. Friendly. Great service."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is great, reasonably priced, and the staff is excellent!! A must try!! FAST AND HEALTHY"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tropical Acai Bowl and it was AWFUL. Not only was this pre-made but it was completely frozen. I couldn't even eat it. Sitting here 20 min later and it's still frozen solid. There were also rock hard raisins and the pineapple was sour and not ripe at all. And to top it all off, my friend found a small hair in her Poke! Yuck!! So disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a healthy place near my home that also offered meal plans so when I found Fix 8, I was so excited to try it. I love how they have different options, meals are not boring. I had spicy tuna bowl with brown rice and my boyfriend had garlic steak with brown rice and it was very good! We will definitely be back and will order meal plans from them!"}
{"text":"The food really is quite delicious. Unfortunately, when I walked in the door the girl behind the counter could care less that I was there, and was very obvious that she had other things to pay attention to.  As I was trying to figure out what to order, she tried to explain in a painfully soft voice, what their menu offered, it was like a SNL skit, she couldn't have been less engaged. After I ordered, another person entered the restaurant, he was younger and much more fit than I and the girl perked up, flirted and was very engaging.  On the plus side a gentleman, probably the owner, promptly brought my food to me, and as I said it was delicious.  It is pretty sparse inside, probably not the best location possible, but I definitely will try it again."}
{"text":"This is great and a superb addition to the healthy restaurants that serve shakes to pancakes! A must try!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad here. The steak and mushroom, garlic steak and Thai peanut chicken are excellent. The service has always been friendly.   The only negative is the surcharge for credit card usage. It's 2016....who carries cash??  It just comes off as petty and small time. Shouldn't these operating costs be reflected in the price of the food?   And for the surcharge fee you apparently pay for the opportunity to leave a tip. It's pretty brazen to charge an extra fee then ask for a tip."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food!  I love the convenience of eating healthy. I ordered the 6 meals for $50. The garlic steak is amazing. I'm defiantly a fan!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but it isn't decent for the price. I ordered grilled chicken and I don't think I've ever ate chicken that dry before. I don't think any food is \"made to order\" but simply warmed up in the microwave or on the stove when purchased. Plus none of the macros are listed for the items offered. The workers also don't seem very kind when you come in to order food. May or may not give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Great place, nice people/owners. If you're out and about and want to eat healthy this is a great choice. Nothing fancy about the menu but I gotta say I was surprised just how tasty the food was! Good fresh ingredients, tasty choices and very good portions. Probably also a good place to check out too if you're looking to improve your nutrition and maybe learn to cook at home a bit as well. Great basic combo's but these guys do it right."}
{"text":"Went there a few months back. Unfriendly customer service. I guess we came in the wrong time. Food was great but not sure if I will return. I'll stick to other options on my side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place, close to my home, healthy, flavorful food, decent price.   Want to try the meal plan.  Will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Nice surprise!  We tried Fix8 on a Yelp whim and were not disappointed.  The garlic steak and brown rice is the bomb.  We took home the acai bowl for dessert but had a spoonful or two on the way home. The place was clean (but I didn't see the restroom...that's always the litmus test) and service was courteous and fast. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our to-go order.  We'll definitely be back...it's good to have a nice place in little 'ol Henderson."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The couple that owns it are very friendly. Food is always great, and their meal plans are very handy. It's hard to find good healthy food that's not going to break the bank.  Always delicious."}
{"text":"Many people say that the location is \"too far\", but for us Henderson folk, it's the perfect location. Hungry High school students, college students, and adults needing a healthy lunch or dinner in the area can come here for a healthy and delicious meal that's fairly priced. Also, for those of you who go to the 24 Hour fitness on Boulder hwy or the gym on horizon, this place is so close it's ridiculous! Get your after workout meal here!   I've never had the acai bowls or smoothies, however the salmon and steak are definitely my go to's. (They also have chicken if you want that as well!) I believe Each meal gives you a choice of a 4oz or 8oz meat, comes with one carb(white or brown rice) & one veggie (I get salad on the side with a vinaigrette dressing?).   Biggest recommendation for the steak: get the garlic steak. You won't regret it.  But really, I don't think you'd regret anything on the menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a healthy lunch. The garlic steak is by far my favorite, but I've tried most options and they are all delicious! I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I had the kimchi. It was very delicious. After I ordered my meal I left and ate at home. If I would've known it was going to be that good I would've ordered more. This place is a good alternative to all the not-so-healthy choices that are located around it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Garlic steak has become an addiction! The staff is great and very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time today and was super impressed!! Loved the layout of the store, the products and the food was super lean, simple, portion controlled and yummy ! These guys definitely live what they preach too!  Definitely happy that they have the bulk meal options for my husband when Im away! Great service!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in how this place has turned out since the owners opened a new location in henderson. The tea machines have been empty the last few times I have been in. The ice machine had no ice and when I asked for ice, the server gave me a cup of ice with what looked like old protein powder on it. The floors were filthy with old food under the tables, and a few of tables had used dirty plates on them.  The food was good, however the restaurant needs some positive change."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very clean with a friendly staff! The garlic steak is where it is at, but everything on the menu is a winner so you can not go wrong no matter what you order. I do not live anywhere near hear and drove 45 mins to get some - nuff said"}
{"text":"Excellent and perfectly portioned.  This is a great healthy choice if you're trying to keep your macros dialed in.  The garlic steak was delicious!"}
{"text":"the tilapia and Brown rice was yummy.   my bf had the steak and mushrooms with white rice and he loved it! definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I get 20 meals a week from here to keep myself on track.  It helps alot working 60+ hour weeks to have a reasonable healthy food option.  Salads are simple and great.  Thanks Rich and co."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant in the past and always thought the food was pretty good. I always had the garlic steak, side salad and brown rice. Recently the quality and service has been absolutely awful. I can't have the red meat so I have been ordering chicken instead. For $10+ per plate I think this place can do a little better than plain boiled chicken breast that is reheated upon order with sauce slapped on top. Furthermore, the service is not good at all. Both times the food took forever to be prepared. There is never more than 1 person working which means he is taking orders and preparing food. That would be fine if I was at least acknowledged that I would be helped soon. Last night I walked in behind a girl that had ordered meal prep. He told her it was not ready yet and it would be about 10 minutes. I expected him to take my order then start it while he was finishing her meals... Nope. I stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes waiting to be helped. He brought the woman her meals, thanked her and walked back into the kitchen without saying anything to me. I had to go to the other side of the counter and asked to be helped. He came over, took my order.. No apology or explanation for why I was ignored, he barely even looked up at me. Got my food after awhile and it was clearly just reheated broccoli and chicken with a strange BBQ on it. I won't be returning and I'm really disappointed that this business has gone so downhill. From what I understand there are new owners. It's a shame that one of the few healthy options in Henderson is not even worth going to anymore."}
{"text":"So I was running early for school one day and I decided to stop in here and grab a quick meal. I was literally right next to CSN so I assumed 30 minutes would be sufficient time to grab something to go. I ordered a Thai Peanut Chicken meal with rice and a salad. After about 20 minutes of waiting... I said hey, I have to go to class is it okay if I come by around 12:30 to grab my meal. The woman told me yeah sure! I made sure she would still be here so there wouldnt be any confusion when I returned.  I come back, and I see a different woman working, cool. I explain to her the situation and show her the receipt, so she goes to talk to the other woman working to confirm. After a few minutes she comes back out, and they tell me have a seat the food will be right out. 30 minutes go by.. I see several people get their food who came after me.. I was so confused. I go back up to ask them why its taking half an hour, she says oh my gosh sorry, we forgot, what did you order again haha sorry the chef is pregnant and forgets things..  i was like wait what? She takes my order again. (so now going over what I would like for the third time)   About 10 minutes later, I receive this strange thai peanut chicken with a side salad and the wrong type of rice I ordered. I said white 3 times :l  No joke, It was room temp slices of chicken with gobs of peanut butter on it. It was as if they took the Skippy PB and scooped it directly onto the chicken. I was grossed out, the chicken looked like it had been sitting for a while. I took 1 bite and knew it was inedible. The salad was really leafy and had no topping, just bitter leafs and a vinaigrette style dressing. I was so fed up with them that day. I felt like complaining to the woman would have been a waste of time. So i threw away the food blatantly staring at them in disgust and left hangry."}
{"text":"Didn't even bother to order. The grammatically incorrect sign stating a 2% surcharge will be added to all \"Credit Card Payment's\" (sic) turned me away. The mark-up can't be so low you need to charge me for the privilege of paying you.  Which also means I won't be exploring your meal prep service... Which my trainer has been harping on me about."}
{"text":"I have to say that there is something to be said about walking in to a place and ordering at the counter Salmon, grilled asparagus and brown rice and having it freshly prepared right in front of you in 8 min.  I really enjoyed this experience.  The quality of food was exactly that it should be, perfect! The flavors were balanced and lightly seasoned so the integrity of the food remained the way nature intended.  Keep up the good work.  We will be back for lots more!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, food is delicious and place is clean. What more could you ask for?? I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Fix 8 has saved me. I don't cook and I usually grab the pizza in our busy cafeteria.  I can make 2 meals out of 1. My kids love it as well!"}
{"text":"I WISH I HAD THIS PLACE AT HOME!! We are here for a volleyball tournament and we love to eat healthy, REAL food. Fit truly delivered. Nice employees and PERFECT food!!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but a wonderful experience at this place.  Not only are their portions amazing but the price for the steak is very reasonable and man is it tasty.   I order the garlic steak and I have enjoyed it so much that I have brought other friends with me just to try it.  I'm happy that this place serves healthy food in a sea of over salted and over carbed food.  I will continue to come here and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here when you're on the go!  We need more restaurants like this in Vegas. Plenty of healthy choices on the menu. Always great food.  Their phone service sucks.  They never answer!  It's annoying.  Just remember they charge you if use a credit card.   A man told the cashier not to mention it to the customers as I was paying.  It's posted, but we sometimes miss it.  Teresa vas very helpful and knowledgable. Keep up the good work! Thanks for the impeccable service.  The SHOYU was not only filling but delicious !"}
{"text":"I've decided to write a review after reading a few others. They have so many wonderful reviews what is one more but I would like to address somethings I think don't give a complete picture. My husband and myself eat there several times a week. 1. The atmosphere - it is supposed to be a little healthy type cafe place. The windows/walls are covered with pics of what most health food/supplment places have, mainly woman that are posed like they would be for a body building shoot. One side is where the food area is and a second where supplements are. There is a tv which has never been loud and in a place where you can choose to watch or not. 2. The workers - they have both men and women that work there. I would say most days there are more women then men but there have been days where it's the opposite. I believe based on what I have seen the women have a choice in what they wear, a t-shirt or a tank top. I seen them wear both. They are friendly but not overly so. Some may think this is unfriendly but I see it as professional. They will bring the food to you at your table, even I'd it's to go if you sit down while waiting. Even see them offer a lady to take it to her truck as she was going to wait in her truck since she had it running. 3. The food/prices - they Cleary have it marked online and in-store the prices for the food. What the food includes. The price difference in the meals are based on the weight of the meat you want, 4oz or 8oz. The food you can see being cooked on the grill in the back right of where you pay for it. It is better then fast food but isn't as fast due to being cooked real food. It is faster then other sit down places. We have tried all the main food dishes (not the smoothies or fruit type meals). They have all been wonderfully flavored and not dry. Rice is rice, it taste like rice! I'm sure if you wanted it to taste different you could put some sauce they offer to put on it but I like rice so never asked. When you pay with card they have a system on a tablet. I've been to a few places that take payments this way since being in Vegas and noticed they are all set up the same way. It automatically ask for a tip. I've never left a tip as I normally get my food to go and even the few times we have ate there I've gotten up to get my own food even though they do bring it to you/cleaned up after myself. They have never giving me different service or treated me badly for not tipping. The only thing I could say I would agree needs to be worked on is to list the nutritional info on all the items/meals. I say this only because they are selling based on the health of the food so most would like to see this information. Not everyone knows how to look this up so would be helpful for those that fall into this group.I know this was very long and I'm sorry for that but I wanted people to get a clear picture of this cafe."}
{"text":"When I teach/instruct at CSN Henderson, Fix8 is definitely one of my go to places for lunch.  They have tons of healthy options but I always go for garlic steak when I come through.  All plates come with brown rice, white rice, sweet potatoes or red potatoes.  They have smoothies for $8 each and if you notice the high prices on the plates and combos, that would probably be most people's complaints but come on, this is healthy!  And healthy food cost more.    If you get lost looking for this place, look for the Popeyes and Starbucks area."}
{"text":"What a great little place! Steak was bomb! Had my first acai bowl and holy cow!!! I will visit next time im in town. Simple healthy delicious food!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"New Owners!!  I didn't review Fix8 when it was ran by the original owners.  I would have given Fix8 5 stars if I did.  There are a few changes now that ownership of Fix8 has changed. Shirley B posted some of the changes on her updated review and the changes are really minor.  Their menu is pretty much the same.  Proteins include steaks, chicken, fish.  Carbs include sweet potato, white rice, and brown rice.  Veggies include broccoli, spinach, and asparagus.  The location still serves Acai bowls and smoothies.    I recently had their garlic steak, egg whites, and grilled asparagus. I originally wanted whole eggs, but it's no longer available. The employee at the register stated that they no longer have whole eggs because they only serve \"healthy\" food here. Well, excuse me!  Since when is a whole egg considered unhealthy?  I know. It's higher in fat, higher calorie, and supposedly bad for your cholesterol.  Egg whites may have enough of the desired macros, which is protein. But it's missing the micronutrients that the yolk provides, like vitamin A, D, E, and K.  In my opinion, Fix8 should have both whole eggs and egg whites.  Anyway, back to the review.  The garlic steak did its job and provided me with protein.  However, something was a little off with the steak.  I can't pin point it.  It just wasn't as good as it used to be.  It didn't even look as good as it used to be (see photos). The asparagus spears are a lot smaller and wasn't nearly as good they were before.  As for the eggs, Fix8 hooked up the egg whites because they no longer serve whole eggs.  They more than made up for the protein with the hook up, but it still lacked the fat that I needed.  Overall, I'm still a fan of Fix8 because I like their business model.  The service was friendly, the prices are okay, and there's still enough on the menu to keep my macros in check."}
{"text":"I tried the garlic steak and korean chicken so far. The garlic steak was BOMB, and the korean chicken was just good (only because I never was a huge fan of chicken tits). Very good portions for the price as well.  As far as customer service goes, TOP NOTCH! The food literally came out in what felt like 5 minutes. They are super friendly and I can't thank Rich (owner) enough for giving me advice on starting my own food business.  We'll definitely be back! ALOHA"}
{"text":"If you like eating at Protein House, Greens & Proteins then you'll like Fix8 more ~  CLEAN menu without unnecessary carbs.   I would have given 5 stars but location sucks. If you leased along Eastern Ave, you would be golden. I do not visit often purely due to location - don't care to drive into Hendertucky.   Back to the food: ordered take out several times and each order is consistent and delicious.   Love ordering garlic steak, brown rice and salad entree. Grilled chicken is great too. Haven't ordered the other protein options since garlic steak is my go-to choice. Taste clean.   Looks like they offer meal prep options."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. We finally did. The atmosphere is a little strange. Not very inviting or warm. It seems plain and boring but oh well. The menu is pretty simple and easy to order. The two girls taking the orders were nice and pointed out the most popular dishes. I didn't like their uniforms. They had on tiny black tank tops and I just didn't find it appealing. A tee shirt would have been better. Boobs don't sell food for me but maybe it works for some. Anyway, I ordered the garlic steak and it was delicious. I paid extra for broccoli instead of rice. That was a little irritating that they charged extra for broccoli and it was just plain, no seasoning or anything. The salad wasn't a salad. It was greens and that was it. At least put a tomato and some carrot shreds on it. Wouldn't cost that much more but would look more appealing. That aside, the ranch was delicious! I loved it. The steak was juicy and soft. I loved the taste of it. I was bugged when they rang us up then handed us the iPad to select how much we wanted to tip. Why was I tipping? They took my order and that's it. It was super awkward and we felt like we had to leave a tip when we normally wouldn't at this type of place. The cost of the meal was way too much. I got the four ounce and my husband got the 8 ounce and together it was $33 with the solicited tip! We could eat at a sit down restaurant for that much. Way too much money. The food is good but we just can't afford to pay that much for lunch. It was good, fresh food but the price was just too much for us."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and well presented. A welcoming cafe, real food! If you're wheat free, this place can work for you :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tasty dishes that aren't loaded with carbs, fats, and starches. Very healthy food options. The owners are extremely friendly.  Most importantly (to me) it is extremely clean!!! Can't go wrong here, great restaurant."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before, not because other places weren't good or anything but I just felt like my comment wouldn't add any discussion to the other hundreds of reviews  That being said I think this place deserved a review and a 5 star one at that ! It's a little pricey but for what you get you cant beat it! Health food is a rarity over In this part of town and it's not some franchise or anything like that it's a nice family owned business  Food was great and they are really willing to change your order to fit your diet plan!   I got the asparagus side salad steak and chicken and it's easily the freshest food I've had including home cooked foods   They also offer a meal plan for 6 or 9 days and that might be something I try in the future but for now I just got the one meal  All in all id definitely give this place a try if I were you because I'm sure glad I did   It's right next to the kfc and Starbucks if you weren't sure where they are located !"}
{"text":"ive eaten here a few times and its decent. Its healthy and fresh. ive always ordered the streak strips broccoli and white rice. the steak is juicy and tender and full of flavor. The broccoli is that perfect bit of steamed where its not mush but its not under cooked either."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I eat here a lot .  The only downside is it's on the expensive side.  I'd have given 5 starts if the prices were a buck or two cheaper. I'd eat here even more often too. The food is always incredible."}
{"text":"Clean, delicious, fast, healthy food. Packaged well for on the go when you are in a hurry.  You pick your protein, how it's flavored, veggie, and white or brown rice."}
{"text":"Fix8 is an amazing place to get quick healthy meals! So excited to see them back and now even closer to me! Can't wait for their protein bar to open!"}
{"text":"This USED to be the place for healthy clean eating. Today I ordered sweet potatoes and brown rice, off the menu, as my sides. The cashier looked at me in astonishment,\" we've never had brown rice or sweet potatoes.\" The new owner doesn't buy that. So, I wound up with chicken and 2 balls of white rice and a wilted salad. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Updated** Stopped in again today as I remembered seeing they had Acai bowls. I ordered the tropical bowl which has pineapple and coconut. Soooo delicious. Ate the entire thing. Had the perfect color and consistency of traditional Acai bowls! Sooo yummy I will be coming back for these often."}
{"text":"Food was great the garlic steak was cooked perfectly. Not sure I will go here often just cause its location is kinda lame but deff worth another visit. It's this word vibe though the guy behind the counter doesn't make you feel very welcome I'm assuming he was a Co owner cause the other lady in there was very bubbly and greeted me and my gf when we came in and said goodbye when we left. The only thing I didn't like was instead of a soda fountain I would have enjoyed maybe some healthier options for drinks but other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out, and my only regret is I didn't order more of the garlic steak! Definitely will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week. Got garlic steak and mushroom with brown rice and ranch for the salad. It was delicious! Wish the salad had its own little container/space so it didnt mix with the steak leaving half of it warm and topped with the steak seasonings, but it was still tastey and im excited to try out their other items. Ill probably be coming here every week now since i go to NSC and have to buy lunch out there."}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving an acai bowl and since is the only place around the area, I decided to give it a try. There's only two options, a tropical acai bowl or a regular acai bowl.   I paid almost $10 for the tropical acai bowl! Never again. I mean, if it was amazing then I would be okay with the price. It was okay. The fruit tasted fresh which is definitely important when I get an acai bowl. But, the actual acai wasn't doing it for me. From the places I've been, most places have really thick acai bases and what I got was really watery. It was good, just not what I was expecting and definitely didn't feel like asking for a better one. I mean I might as well have ordered a smoothie!   Not sure if I'm gonna come back, I understand that they specialize more on the food rather than the bowls but I still think the consistency should be good no matter what it is!"}
{"text":"This place is the TRUTH. My house mates are both entreprenuers and work from home and I saw them eating meals from here. I live on the strip- and sometimes it's but a pain to go somewhere and sit and pay for something, it's wastes a lot of time and mental energy, and as someone under 30 (we all are) sometimes I don't want to cook and clean three meals a day for myself.  This place a) delivers b) has *super* good customer service (Rich is the best, he's always sending me helpful emails- because sometimes the ordering system eludes me, even though I do it like every week). c) is healthy and d) is DELICIOUS. I moved here from Oahu and their Blazin steaks (all of their steaks) are freakin biblical, so is their chicken and fish. I grind on all of it, for real. I'm not a big fan of tilapia in general, so I probably should stop ordering it, but I think this place is awesome."}
{"text":"5 stars for the seasoning on the food very tasty very simple very good  less stars for the very cold atmosphere setting of the dining area if they had a drive through this place would be packed I sure hope they stay in business because the food is excellent the guy behind the counter could be a little bit more friendly but I think it's just his nature. Oh and one other thing it's hard to believe that kind of eating healthy place doesn't have lemon wedges? I much rather have a wedge of lemon with my salmon than any type of sauce not to mention lemons in water but its new I'm sure they're working out some things.  Also since there is no drive thru they should have a couple spaces up front marked \"i called ahead\" or \"food pick up\" so you can Pull up and they can run the food out to you or you can run in and get it  typing by voice so excuse the punctuation marks or lack of."}
{"text":"So I just stopped by for my first time and I was very impressed! The menu was a lot bigger than I expected. Right away I noticed they had poke which was awesome but the really cool part about it was that they had two types. Spicy and Shoyu which I really liked because I'm a big fan of poke but most places make it too spicy so the Shoyu option was cool for people who like fish but don't like anything spicy. I also got an add on side of steak which was delicious and a Green smoothie. I asked if the green smoothie had any added sugar in and they said no, just the fruits and protein! I was considering leaving four stars only because it was a bit expensive but after eating the food it's totally worth it. I definitely would suggest checking out this place!"}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE acai bowls. So I came to Fix8 because the acai bowl pictured here looks quite delicious. Boy was I disappointed! I wish I could show you guys a photo of it, but unfortunately my phone died right before I received my acai bowl, and I was not gonna wait 30 minutes for me to get home to eat it. My acai bowl came in a small rectangular container about an inch thick, topped with very bland granola, and banana that was not ripe yet. NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!! The acai itself was okay in taste, but the sheer expectations I had from seeing the picture on yelp just put me in the worst mood while eating this thing. Please take the misleading photo down. It might save someone else from expecting too much in the future. I probably would not have been so upset had I not seen it. 1 star for the acai bowl, but I'm giving 2 stars just because I haven't tasted anything else here so maybe other items are decent? I will never know! The misleading acai bowl ensures that I won't be making the long drive here again."}
{"text":"So I am changing my review score to 1 star after receiving the following threat from the owner: \"Richard C: Stick to fast food if you want your food faster them 10 min and stop bad mouthing hard working people before you get slapped douch.\"  If you support people like Richard that believe customers are always wrong and that insults and threats are the response then feel free to dine here. Otherwise there are far better options in Henderson where small business owners actually appreciate feedback and use it better their business.  My original review is below.   I'm sorry but I don't know how this cafe has such a high rating, as it is not on par with other 4 star reviewed restaurants here is Las Vegas. For starters I understand that it is supposed to be a healthy option for dining, but for a first time patron, I couldn't find any info on the nutritional content of the meals and shakes. It's not listed on the website or the menu board at the restaurant, and in my opinion it should be openly displayed. Isn't that the purpose of eating healthy, so you know what you are taking in? Second, there are lots of healthy restaurants and places that have healthy menus that don't sacrifice taste to make their food \"healthy\". Places like Skinnyfats or Rachel's Kitchen are two examples that offer delicious meals and tell you exactly what you are taking in. The Thai Peanut Chicken I had tasted like a piece of frozen chicken (it wasn't juicy, seasoned, or cooked to order) warmed up with store bought peanut sauce on it. For $12 if you are going to serve me a handful of greens, some rice, and a plain piece of chicken it had better be farm to table fresh or have some flavor. My wife's PB shake wasn't bad though.  Third, there were 3 girls working and only 4 customers in the store but it took about 10 mins from when we ordered to when the food/drink was ready. Considering the chicken and rice just had to be scooped into a box and sauce poured on and the salad was lettuce that was already packaged, the only delay should be the shake, but that shouldn't take 10 mins. Another opportunity for improvement would be instead of just shouting out a number when your order is ready, to actually call people by name instead. I declined a receipt so there was confusion about whether the meal was ours since the food was done separately from the shake.  All in all if you just want overpriced fuel, this place fits the bill, but even then I would rather go somewhere that told you what calories, fat, protein, etc you are taking in."}
{"text":"This place is really great! In this area there are entirely too many fast food and junk food places. So if you are watching your health or just don't want junk..here you are.  Excellent ideas, and menu. I would like to see more vegetable options as not everyone eats rice.. but good overall."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and made to order. The garlic steak is the bees knees. The portions are great and will keep you going for the rest of the day. A breath of fresh air for a city full of greasy gut wrenching fast food chains. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried the Korean chicken with onions and was quite good. Chicken was tender and seasoning was good, wish it was a little spicier. Brown rice was cooked well and mixed greens was simple and straightforward.  Fix8 is quite casual and low on decoration, but still works just fine. Appreciate a place that cooks tasty, healthy food well."}
{"text":"This little place is awesome. Simple meals, but with delicious flavor. Hard to believe this is a healthy food restaurant, but it may make getting bathing suit ready a snap."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Healthy food doesn't have to taste awful, and fix8 proves it. They serve healthy and tasteful food that would fill your appetite. Check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with a friend last week. Happened to find them on Yelp, they are close to the house, so we decided to check them out. Their food is a protein, rice and veggies. Healthy and rather tasty. They serve protein shakes as well, though we did not try them this time. I didn't see any without whey, which is a problem for me. We both had the steak, I had mine with mushrooms, his was the garlic. The portions are very good for the price and taste good. Odd choice of location, would have expected something like this near a gym, not tucked back in a strip mall on a not-so-busy street. Wish them luck"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and haven't had a bad experience. You absolutely cannot go wrong with the garlic steak with a side of brown rice and greens."}
{"text":"Fix8 is a great spot. The food is delicious, the shakes are nutritious, there's variety and you get a good amount of food for a good price.   I always tip when I come here (mainly because I want Fix8 to stick around for a while!) but the customer service needs a little help. There's particularly one counter girl - every time I come in and she's at the counter, she looks like she doesn't want to be there and half heartedly answers any questions you ask. Besides that, this place is a must go if you're in the mood for something quick and healthy.   The garlic steak with egg whites (I add onions for $1 extra) and the poke bowl have been my favs so far. Keep up the deliciousness Fix8!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely HORRIFIED at this location. Utterly disappointed. Theresa, the supervisor, was cooking the Thai peanut sauce, stirring the mix with her whisk, and placed her finger onto the whisk to taste the sauce. Furthermore, placing the tampered whisk back into the pan and wiping her finger onto a napkin. ABSOLUTELY UNHYGIENIC. God forbid there was a staph infection involved, or E. coli.   I was so shocked, the girl at the counter asked, \"Is something wrong?!\" I told her to please cancel my order, for a refund, and why I was so appalled. I LOVED this place, with the original owners. But now I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Acai bowl with fruit was very good.  Not a lot of options, but the taste of the actual acai was very good.  Came with granola, strawberries and bananas.  The other food looked good too!"}
{"text":"Got Macros?  If you have the MyFitnessPal app on your phone, this is just the place for you. Already a fan of Fix8 when they had their old location, I'm very happy that they're back because it gives me a lunch option when I'm too lazy or tired to bring my own food to work.   PROTEIN: -steak:  grilled, garlic, kimchee, steak n mushroom, loco moco -chicken:  grilled, Thai peanut, Korean, or BBQ -fish: tilapia, salmon, or mango salmon The above choices are available in 4 or 8 oz portions with white rice, brown rice, or you can substitute (with surcharge) these VEGGIES/CARBS:  broccoli, mushrooms, sweet potato, spinach, onion, or asparagus.  Also available: -poke bowls: spicy or shoyu -tofu: grilled or salad -wraps: chicken, steak, or ahi -combo meals  Located at the corner of Horizon and College behind the Starbucks. Open Monday-Saturday, 11am-7pm. Come here for tasty food that you can enjoy without guilt."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Was told no additional charges to substitute veggies for rice or salad, charged an additional $8 for extras. When asked was told its in the menu but was never given a menu not posted anywhere or on the menu board! Then was told I was being rude! And the fact that they didn't train employee to know what he was talking about doesn't mean I should be on the hook for the cost! And the manager snickered while putting through refund! Stupid is as stupid does! No wonder there were no customers in the lobby! And to top it off you are sitting In The kitchen eating behind the counter when there are customers there! Bad form! Do yourself a favor go to protein house instead!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the first night I went here. The staff was very nice and answered my silly questions about the menu and food. I got my order to go and ate it at home...I got the Korean chicken and it was delicious!!! I will be frequenting this place and trying everything on the menu. So glad to have this option close to home."}
{"text":"First time here. This review is solely based on their acai bowl. To be honest I think it really deserves a 2 star but because I've heard such good things about their food I don't think it would be fair for me to hit their page with a 2 star.   I was really excited to find a place in Henderson that offered acai bowls. My usual spot is Acai to the T in summerlin. I was in the area meeting up with a girlfriend and decided to stop by this place.    Unfortunately the acai bowls served at Fix8 leave ALOT to be desired. They offer two different flavors same size the original is $6 and change, and the tropical one is $8 and change. Service was good and the bowl came out quick. When I opened up the container I instantly knew this wasn't going to be anything like the last place I went to but thought I'd still give it a try. The consistency of the bowl was pretty awful and came out more like a slush. Coupled with very little granola and the bits of fresh fruit it definitely wasn't worth the money.   Also I have to mention that at Acai to the T, they offer two sizes: regular $6.99 and large. 8.99 same price doesn't matter what flavor you go with.... At Fix 8 their one size is still smaller than the regular size at Acai to the T AND you get stuck paying more for the \"Tropical flavor\" AND paying that of what would be the large at Acai to the T.   Save your money, don't try their acai bowl. Like I said, I havnt had their food but I've had several people tell me good things."}
{"text":"Thank god there is finally a healthy eating place in my area now!! Horizon & College.  I would have to go to GV Pkwy or Eastern area in the past.  Love the food and you get a lot for the price! Just wish they were open later than 7."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience with this place. The garlic steak was sooo good. The garlic sauce is pretty much their version of teriyaki sauce. It is a must try, you won't be disappointed. I went with my gf and it was our first time there. The food is absolutely delicious. The service is friendly. I wish they had one closer to my side of town. One of my new fave places to get a healthier food fix."}
{"text":"I love this little local cafe! The workers are really friendly and they cook good stuff! If you're feeling too lazy or just need someone to help you get on your feet to start meal prepping, this is a perfect spot. People don't like the location, but if you really like a place you'll drive out to it. Their food is the healthiest spot in the area so no wonder why it's always busy when I go there. Their wraps are delicious and definitely fill you up. Salads are great, you can't really go wrong with a salad and if you do then.......go seek help duh. But the 5 star hitter is the Acai Bowl! So delicious. Great texture. Not too sweet. Bananas, strawberries, blueberries, and granola/seeds. Uhhh, I would eat one every day if I could, but let's not go there. I love this place! Thank goodness for Yelp!"}
{"text":"Plain Smoothie... I ordered the green smoothie minus the protein powder bc I don't like whey and it was very watery. I can only explain the flavor as a banana and some spinach blended with a lot of ice and water. Would not get another one from here. Also order the 6oz BBQ chicken for my husband so I haven't tasted it but it smells good and seems like a good amount of chicken."}
{"text":"Anyone wanting a quick, delicious and healthy meal should really check out Fix8. My husband and I use to stop by every once in a while and loved it. We are now on a meal plan and love it! Great food and saves me so much time! I would recommend Fix8 to anyone!"}
{"text":"We are so happy to see Fix8 back again! We missed you during your move.  Fix8 is the best of quick pick up meals and healthy dining. Wonderful, tender filet migon, salmon, or chicken. With healthy side choices; brown rice, sweet potato, field greens, or steamed broccoli. I always get the kimchi beef, sweet potato, and salad. It's a balanced meal and the portions are just the right amount. My husband is a big guy and he's able to order a larger meal.    The owners are a super friendly married couple who just moved here from Hawaii. They always remember you and greet you with a big smile. You know you're going to have good food when the person preparing it is happy.   They also do meal delivery plans. I could eat Fix8 every night of the week! It's that good!"}
{"text":"I am so proud of myself for resisting the urge to visit one of the many fast food establishments nearby and sticking to my original plan to come here (I looooove fast food. I can't help it.)   First let me say that this 3-star review shouldn't deter you from coming here, and I hope that this place stays open for a long, long time. This side of town - heck, this town in general - sorely lacks healthy eating options and I would hate to see this place close. So why the 3-star review? Well, I never give 5 stars based on a single experience, so that makes it an automatic 4, but I have a few suggestions for improvement, so it's a 3.  I came here in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday so it was naturally pretty dead when I came in. There was a kid riding a razor scooter in the dining area, but as soon as he saw me pull up he dashed behind the counter. The buff, tattooed man behind the counter was very friendly and helpful as it was my first time here. I ordered, and the food came out FAST - so fast that I actually remarked out loud, \"that was fast!\"   I had the Korean chicken with brown rice. The flavor was good and the chicken was juicy.   In any case, some suggestions for improvement: 1. Offer sauce on the side, or use less sauce, or use more rice, or use divided containers. The point here is that while the sauce was flavorful and delicious, by the time I was done eating, my rice was completely saturated in sauce. I would prefer the sauce to either stay on the chicken or have just a little bit on my rice. I know some people like a lot of sauce, so I think the problem isn't in the amount of sauce itself, but more in the way it is served.  2. Again with the to-go containers. Salad comes in the same container as hot rice and chicken, so by the time you get home (especially if you are an *excellent* driver like I am ;) ) the salad is completely wilted from the steam and covered in chicken sauce. Which was fine, because the sauce for the Korean chicken actually made a decent salad dressing, but maybe sometimes you don't want chicken sauce on your salad.  Overall, I would definitely come here again to try other items. They seem to have a wide variety of options for every taste. It IS a little on the pricey side for the amount of food you get, but for good service and fresh ingredients I don't mind paying a little more - especially since their prices are clearly listed on the website."}
{"text":"TLDR: rotten black lettuce in salad. Tacos soggy sitting in watery sauce.    Bought two meals.   Used to love this place but the quality had gone down. I had tilapia tacos but the tortilla fell apart because they got soggy. There was so much watery sauce that ran out it made the other tortilla soggy and it fell apart on the plate. I ate them but the salad was gross....  couldn't finish the salad. There were black rotten pieces of lettuce. I ate half before I'd noticed.   I remember the salad being a lot fresher.  Not the quality I expect for over $24.  Asked for a refund of 1 of the meals. Got it. But I don't think I'll be back again. I have other places for after the gym. It's lettuce. How can you mess up lettuce?"}
