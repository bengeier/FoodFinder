{"text":"I liked it here okay, but this was not my cup of tea.  Dark, smokey, loud.  I guess I just don't like bars in general.  I went to attend Lady Fest.  While everyone working there was at least somewhat friendly, they failed to inform anyone that the concerts moved downstairs while the next set was preparing upstairs.  I didn't even realize there was a downstairs (I guess I should've read some of the other Yelp reviews more carefully).  There was a sign up by the stage, but that was the only indication that the concerts moved downstairs.  I guess perhaps this is not the fault of the bar, but it would've been really helpful for the bouncers to share that information when I came in.....  They weren't busy at all and it wouldn't have been too difficult for them to share that info, I don't think.  The drinks were good, but expensive for my preferences.  $5 for a beer, $8 for a mixed drink.    As I mentioned before, the bartenders were very nice, especially one of them.  However, the clientele was decidedly unfriendly.   I don't know, as I also mentioned earlier, I don't care for bars that much, but had gone to see the Lady Fest bands.  This was just not a good experience for me, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the 'burgh! The atmosphere is super friendly and welcoming to everyone! Lots of scheduled events keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Smoky bar with the worst service I've ever had. Way understaffed, almost impossible to get a bartender. Waited 15 minutes before someone served me. One bartender had to look at the menu to see what went in each drink. Ordered a pizza, then watched as it sat and got cold before I could get a bartender to give it to me. Horrible attitude from one bartender as I tried to order another round of the most watered down drinks imaginable. I understand that things get stressful when you're swamped, but you don't get to sass your patrons. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Kind of a divey surprisingly large bar in a residential section of Lawrenceville. The food is touted as amazing, pizzas and calzones etc. however it was really greasy. Competing with Mineo's greasy. Cattivo's is occasionally fun on a saturday night-- sometimes packed and sometimes the bartender is the only one there for ladies night.  Even when packed, few will get down and dance to soldier boy. The drinks are cheap so get liquored up and go with a big group..."}
{"text":"Owner held our band equipment hostage after he had a misunderstanding with one of the other bands. Demanded we pay him the \"rest of the money\" ($60) he was owed until we could get our equipment and leave. Told him we never saw or agreed to any kind of contract or even had any part in booking the show --- he said it didn't matter. Never going back to Cattivo. In all our years of playing in Pittsburgh, no bar owner has ever treated us so poorly."}
{"text":"Well, this bar isn't amazing but it's not bad. I wouldn't say it's as classy as 5801, but I don't think it's meant to be. If you're looking for girls though, this is your place. There are some guys that hang out, but it's mostly a lesbian bar.  Beware if you hate the smell of smoke. This bar is a haven for those who love to smoke and you will leave smelling like an ashtray.   Good luck if you're new to the city and trying to meet people...everyone that goes here seems to know each other. There's so many cliques and I can't say I've ever had a hard time meeting people until I went to this bar. I am a very down to earth person, but if I may, my fiancee and I are a pretty cute couple and I'm surprised no one had ever bothered to say \"hi\" when we are there. She's the quintessential hot androgynous type and I'm the girlie one....we're not overly-affectionate and we would talk to anyone who would talk to us...but everyone is too busy meeting up with people they already know. We are the farthest thing from stuck up and neither of us have EVER had an issue meeting friends at a bar EVER until we went here. Go to 5801 if you're looking to meet a friend.  There is an occasional girl that comes in to host parties...she flaunts around like she's a wannabe Dawn Denbo and it's kind of a buzz kill.  I will say that drinks are cheap and food is great if you have a good buzz going..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to events here a few years now since moving to Pittsburgh and would probably go more often just to hang out if I lived closer. The food is outstanding, especially for a bar. Try the pizza or cheese fries, you won't regret it. The staff is great and attentive. Drinks are not watered down, just about the right strength. My favorite place to go out in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Cool,  neighborhood bar.  Good place to watch the game....good drink prices & good food.  Sometimes it gets really packed on Saturday nites,  and the lower level downstairs is really nice.  Too bad the upstairs isn't as nice.  Unfortunately,  it's the only lesbian bar left in the city.   :(  It's a nice chill spot,  most of the patrons are kinda friendly & the bartenders are nice too.  It's not the fanciest bar in the city,  but I always have a good time everytime I come here."}
{"text":"Ok - I'm straight and go to Cattivo all the time and usually drag my boyfriend.  I love the bartender, Andrea (she makes a killer margarita and ask for the Starburst shot), and the crowd is always fun.  Thursdays are karaoke and a total scream - you will laugh, trust me.  The buffalo chicken pizza is amazing.  It's, by far, my favorite thing on the menu, but everything I've tried there is definitely above average.  I like Cattivo because it's not pretentious, or trying to be something it's not.  It's a bar where people drink, smoke, laugh, sing, dance, play pool, eat, and go home (hopefully, not alone!).  I love the downstairs, too.  I've gone to a few art shows and seen several great bands there.  It's a totally different vibe and a bit more upscale (which is pretty ironic, considering it's the basement).  I would say the main floor is a bar and the downstairs is a lounge.  Sometimes, I bounce between floors....how fun is that??  Drunk karaoke to start and then I collect myself and go downstairs to be a bit more cultured and civilized....all this social goodness and cheap entertainment in one building!   They have tons of special events, parties, and cool promotions, too.....check out their Facebook page.  I never go to Lawrenceville without stopping at Cattivo :-)"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh. It makes no sense I know. This ordinary bar on a side street in Lawrenceville but I'm telling you the truth. Exceptional crust, great sauce and perfectly cooked. Their white pizza is a hidden gem and might be the best white pizza in all of Pittsburgh.   Give it a shot. They do take out if you just want a pizza at home."}
{"text":"I really like this bar! Friendly service, great \"bar food\" and pizza, reasonable drinks. Upstairs is very \"neighborhood bar\" feeling, but downstairs is very nice and loungy, big enough to dance or go across the floor talk and actually hear what's being said. Nice decor, clean. I can go all decked out and not feel out of place. It is a lesbian bar, which is awesome because they are very tolerant and open minded and get all kinds of people, especially on the different club nights like Sinferno that happen regularly. I'm straight, and its one of the only places I go to dance!"}
{"text":"This is a strong contender along with blue moon for the best gay bar in the city- and they're right down the street from each other! (I may or may not have gone to both bars in one night.) I've been here a couple times, and have had trouble both times finding this hole in the wall a little off the beaten track. However, the bar opens up nicely once inside and has a large middle area with an island bar, equipped with a few pool tables and dart boards on one side. This is actually a great and fun place to karaoke- no judgements, just a good time. A great mixed crowd here- straight women and men, gay men and lesbians. The last time I stopped in I ran into a straight couple who I'm good friends with. They just came to enjoy a fun night out, which is exactly what you will probably have if you stop in here! Oh, and FYI, the food here is pretty damn good too."}
{"text":"I usually end up here for the most random of reasons. Flea market K-Pop Night Drag shows Birthday parties Drink/Paint parties Karaoke It's mostly a lesbian bar, which is great to have so many LGBT (and friendly) venues in Lawrenceville.  Everyone is very sweet and helpful that works there.  They have good beer selections.  The food is good, it's bar food, but it's good.  The pizza is pretty much your standard pizza.  Nothing to write home about but definitely not a greasy mess either.   It's a large space, and the basement is great for a lot of different activities."}
{"text":"This place still deserves five stars. My husband and I had our wedding reception here last May (no, it's not as dickish as it sounds - we're LGB, the guests were too, and at the time, the bar ran a new-wave night every Saturday...BTW, another name for \"new-wave night\" is \"all the bisexuals in the city are here right now,\" FYI), and it was a hell of a good time. Our guests and I were treated to a band that sounded like a New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders-esque soloing and all, fronted by a cool, tough-as-nails punk chick who dressed sexy and sassy. We danced like there was no tomorrow - and the DJ spun all of our favorites, like \"She's in Parties\" by Bauhaus and \"The Passenger\" by Iggy Pop.   Even though we spent the second half of 2012 preparing to bid Pittsburgh farewell, we always came back to Cattivo at least once a month. The DJs indulged my requests, cutting their lineup of tinny sounding modern dance music to play now-classics like \"Policy of Truth\" by Depeche Mode and \"Laid\" by James.   If you want to dance your heart out on Saturday nights, I'm telling you - do NOT miss Cattivo on the second and fourth Saturdays of every month. I'm working on a potential business deal with a Pgh friend who's a Cattivo regular, and I'm already salivating at the thought of attending another Hanging Garden dance night."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! They have AMAZING wings (I do not usually eat wings but these are great!) and the PIZZA!! OMG, you cannot beat it!!  2 floors, 2 different bars,  They always have different events Painte night is a blast! If you get a chance, check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a good place if you have friends who enjoy different types of bars. Want to dance? Eat Pizza? Chill at the bar? Play darts, pinball? There is something for everyone. I personally am not into the dancey-club scene, but a lot of my friends are, so this place is a good compromise for us.   There is usually a cover if they have a DJ doing a theme night-- Beyonce night, Drake night, etc., but it's usually only $5. Drinks are priced for the neighborhood, not as cheap as some of my favorite dive bars, but not too ridiculous either. The bar area is pretty large and they usually have a few different bartenders on duty, so I've never had to wait that long for a drink.  They also serve pizza. Never had it myself, but have heard great things from friends who have had it!"}
{"text":"I go here because my friends go here. The staff is 9 times out of 10 gonna treat you like shit and like you don't belong there. I *really* hate giving business to these people but they're one of the few lgbt+ (\"friendly\" now apparently) places around.   The drinks are heavily over priced and the food is mostly horrible. I once bought 6 drinks and didn't even get a buzz. It's so overpriced. Maybe it's for tourists or the rich, entitled Lawrenceville hipsters idk. It's not for me.   Trust me- go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this because the secret will be out, but this place has some of THE BEST bar food and PIZZA in the city. It's a very unassuming place tucked away in a side street in Larryville and is very welcoming of diversity (as all places should be), and it cooks up some of the best food around and really reasonable prices. Plus alcohol too. What more could you want or need? Kitchen stays open late too which is another plus. I've had their pizza, amaze balls breadsticks and cheese sticks. I would venture to say this is the best pizza in Larryville."}
{"text":"I like this place. I go with my mom and it's always a good time. It does seem a little less friendly than some other bars- I've tried striking up conversations with people and get the stink-eye. Some other reviewers have called the place pretentious- I can see that. It's still a decent place to go, though, as long as you don't go alone. The food is awesome and drinks aren't badly priced."}
{"text":"This is a great venue to catch a show (I've been here for drag shows and punk shows) or just hang out at the bar. Drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders are friendly.   I've been hearing luscious things about their food and the last time I visited, I finally got to try some menu items. The pizza is fantastic and the Stromboli was the size of a toddler. I was beyond impressed. Love finding a dive bar with good food.   I'm going to be a lame-o and complain about the whole smoking inside thing, though. I know it's appealing to a lot of people, but my virgin lungs always need to step outside for a few fresh breaths throughout the night. Ventilation seems to be better than most smoking bars in the city, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Nice location with nice bartenders , great owner and good food ! :)"}
{"text":"Once again, a preface...I am NOT a bar fan of any variety.  Sitting at a bar and drinking for recreation is not my idea of any kind of fun time.  A former friend of mine who IS more than a recreational drinker invited me along with another of his recreational drinker buddies to Cattivo for 'dinner'.  Since I don't really have the opportunity to get out much, and never having been to the place, I said 'sure'.  Flat out, I can't comment on the 'bar' aspect of this bar.  I do know it's supposed to be predominantly Lesbian, I can't say whether the drinks are good or not because I didn't drink, and I can't comment on the 'gay' or 'entertainment' aspects because frankly, I don't care for drag or thudding thump-thump dance music, and wasn't there for any...but for me, what this review is about is the food aspect of Cattivo.  If you are a fan of 'bar food', and like it to be REAL bar food, done right, then Cattivo should be on your list for a place to drop by for a quick bite.  While lush one and two sat downing their drinks, talking incessantly and not listening to each other or me if I attempted to join the 'conversation', I ordered the fried fish that came with a side of fries, and the fried appetizer platter, with my usual Diet Coke.  The portions were generous, and more importantly, they were made with care, and were real.  This wasn't a frozen fish patty nuked back to life, or a bag of frozen veggies dumped in the deep fryer to fry and burn.  The fish was flavorful and tender, and the breading was seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The fries were real and cooked just right, and the appetizers (which were plentiful) were chicken wings (nice and plump and juicy without being overcooked,) Provolone sticks (again, cooked just right, crispy and seasoned on the outside, gooey and tasty on the inside,) zucchini (in strips, ditto to the rest,) mushrooms (ditto) and they served it up with some ranch dressing for me, which I always prefer over marinara sauce.  Honestly, the fish was tastier and more reasonable in price than anything I've ever gotten from Wholey or Benkovitz.    If you're around Lawrenceville, and you're looking for a really good end of the work day fish sandwich and a side of fries, in a pretty calm and relaxed atmosphere, and you don't mind doing it without seventeen TV's blasting sports coverage at you, then this is definitely a good choice to make.    I can't speak for the 'bar party hour', but I can speak for the basic dinner hour, and some very good and reasonable food.  Just one warning to the health freaks.  I smoke, and in my own life generally I don't smoke indoors at all, but Cattivo does permit smoking in the bar and restaurant.  So if you're the type that starts coughing at the sight of an unopened pack of cigarettes deep in a vending machine, this might not be the option for you."}
{"text":"Two floors with their own dance floor, dj, and bar.  Music is very pop/top 40.  There's a drag king show that goes on Saturdays downstairs.  Only lesbian bar I've found in the area and I'm not really a big fan.  If you want to go somewhere to dance then you should go headover to the straight bars.  Upstairs they serve food til late and it was pretty good.  Drinks are cheap but pretty weak.  The area outside also looks a little sketch."}
{"text":"I was there for night 2 of their annual Howl-o-ween bash! I freaking ROCKED out to some amazing cover bands (like B52s, The GoGos, AC/DC). They had alternating shows upstairs and downstairs and this event was non smoking.   I had some tasty brews and the buffalo chicken pizza was DELICIOUS. My friend got a burger and that looked amazing, too. Overall the place did seem kind of \"divey\" but man, I love dive bars haha and especially ones with such great food. The service was good and everyone else there was SO nice and friendly!   Bathrooms were a bit cramped and left something to be desired but they weren't disgusting.   Overall I had a really really fun time here and would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Despite living only a few blocks from here, I had never been to Cattivo until this past Saturday night. They were having some kind of Beyonce dance party, so obviously we had to check that out.  It was much larger than I expected inside. I have no idea what the norm is for this place, but it was PACKED last Saturday. There was still enough room for everyone to dance, but pushing through the crowd from the bar to my friends' spot on the dance floor (without spilling my drink everywhere) took some serious determination.  Drinks were reasonably priced and service was fairly quick, given the amount of people waiting around the bar. The crowd was diverse. I love these kind of places where anyone and everyone is welcome.  The music was great--goes without saying it was all Beyonce, all night. I can't really say what the other nights are like, but we will definitely be back to check it out again."}
{"text":"You want comedy? Flea market? Drag queens? Karaoke? Goth and Industrial nights? Cattivo offers everything. Decent drink prices, great staff. I've been here for so many different events and they're always packed."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my friends on Friday and completely regret that decision. Here's why:  1. it's pretty awful.  2. The fact that they allow smoking is fine, but honestly can we invest in a better ventilation system? After five minutes in there I smell like hot garbage.   3. The mixed drinks are weak and the drafts are entirely over priced.   4. NO TAP WATER. Personally when I'm drinking I like to have a glass of water so I don't feel like hell the next day. WELL, after purchasing a pitcher of beer I asked for a water as well. The gentleman bartender happily obliged and gave me my request. A few moments later the female bartender came over grabbed my water and said \"WE ONLY SERVE BOTTLED WATER\" Umm... okay, so now with a purchase I can't have a glass of Pittsburgh tap water, rather I must purchase a bottle of water? She then proceeded to yell at the boy bartender about his CARELESS mistake.   5. The crowd is equivalent to a lesbian frat (yes frat, not sorority) house. Have fun with that."}
