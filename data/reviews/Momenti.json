{"text":"I hate giving poor reviews. Hate it, but I must warn others.

We tried this place on a whim.  We should have done more research before going in.  The tables are dirty and the lack of attention to details like the Parmesan cheese containers on every table being empty should have warned us off, but... like many explorers before us, we forged ahead.

 The pizza was bland, greasy, and undercooked.  The salad was a mix of very old lettuce served in a plastic container.  As the only people in the place, we could hear the two staff members talking about the lack of lettuce and other ingredients.  ( why let us order something when all the ingredients are not in house?! )

Perhaps the botox place nearby will take the space over."}
{"text":"Alice is the nicest host ever! The food was fresh and good. Best of all zoyo is next door. Zoyo is the best yourgat ever."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend here today and have nothing but good things to say, especially about the level of service. We ordered the Meatlovers pizza (although I'm not sure that is the exact name), and about 10 minutes after we ordered, one of the staff came out to tell us that the pizza got a bit overdone and they wanted to make us a new one that was properly cooked. They offered us free yogurt while we waited, which was delicious. It isn't often you experience that level of service, and I thought they handled the situation really well. Once we got the pizza it, of course, was delicious. The space is tiny and quaint, with a nice atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend this hidden gem if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and 2 grandchildren visited the new Momenti's last Saturday and found the pizza reasonably priced and very tasty; just the way we like it. We love crunchy thin crust pizza with a light spicy sauce, that is not \"loaded\" with so many toppings that you can't taste the pizza, or enjoy the crust. We also tried the root beer float made with Zoyo's cake batter yogurt... WOW... best root beer float I have had in years.

{"text":"Similar to Sauce pizza. Pretty damn good, especially the  new chicken pizza (no olives of course)"}
{"text":"Popped in to check out the scene a few months ago when they were about a week old. Music is a little loud but I like the beats and I like that the restaurant is literally a little slice of hall in the whole building between Zoyo and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. 

The menu stays basic - they want to extend the concept of a build your own pizza by keeping the overall menu short. They seem to post the most popular pizza combinations to give you an idea but they also have a list of their ingredients available for you to peruse and create your own. 

Staff was super friendly and willing to help and answer any questions we had. We like it when people work their creative juices with food so we let one of the pizza makers (Joseph?) do his thang and create his own recommended pizza. If I remember correctly there was several meats, red sauce, mushrooms, and tomatoes (I may be one or two ingredients off). In any case, the pizza came out piping hot in about 10-12 mins and was pretty darn delicious!  My non-appetite suddenly perked up with the smells coming from the box. Despite it being 9pm we gobbled that up quick.  We also bought a soda because the owner suggested something awesome - why not get root beer and go next door to Zoyo for the vanilla froyo to make a root beer float?  

GENIUS.  We did as we were told and it was a nice addition to our meal. Did we also go get froyo afterward?  Duh. Why not?  They make it easy peasy and it's really the intention of the partnership - have dinner, then have dessert.  Sold. 

Overall, it was a very nice surprise to walk into and whenever we are in the area we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet.  This place was ok. Could have been better. The pizza was simple and maybe that's what they are looking for. The salads I would say need a little zing to it (flavor/added ingredients). If I'm looking for pizza one night and because  it's right next to my favorite place (Zoyo...!!!), then I will drop on by."}
{"text":"This was the WORST pizza my husband & I have EVER had! Aside from the fact that it was over-priced, the crust was burnt-but not all-over. We ordered a tomato/mushroom but received one tomato slice and about six mushroom slices, swimming in what looked and tasted like Velveeta imitation cheese. The maranara sauce was totally invisible and we certainly couldn't taste any! To top this experience off, their fountain drinks were so watered -down that the taste was non-existent. My husband swears he got Diet Pepsi even though he pushed regular Pepsi. We have NEVER had such an over-priced, poor eating experience, which is too bad because I was looking forward to trying this new place which is so close to home. My husband was right - we should have gone to Barro's! We were hoping it would have been more like Piology in California."}
{"text":"My husband I were excited to try a new pizza place. We're from Chicago and have pretty high standards. Needless to say it was terrible. We could have gotten the same level of taste quality from a pizza place at the mall food court. I'd only recommend this place to people I didn't like. Definitely pass but enjoy ZoYo or Coffee Beam on either side. They're both fabulous and a better bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome!!  My daughter loves to get a pepperoni pie after school and they are usually ready in about 10 minutes. The staff is super nice and it has a very cozy feel to it with outdoor seating as well!  Have them brush the crust with the special garlic olive oil!!  Extra crispy and flavorful!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it into Momenti last weekend.  The restaurant is located in a small narrow spot blended into Zoyo's next door with only a small number of tables.  The restaurant has its mission (statement) in chalk on the wall when you enter - unique.  It also has a series of photos from area the Shea/PV neighborhood - unique. The atmosphere is modern and matches the neighborhood.

When I placed my order, only one person was working the cash register, pizza oven and cleaning tables.  It was chaotic, but understood since it was around 4:00 p.m. and the dinner crew had not started.  I had ordered a margherita pizza, cheese pizza and salad.  The salad came out first, followed by the cheese pizza.  I waited for my margherita pizza.  The sole worker in the restaurant forgot about it and the pizza was partially burnt.  He gave me the pizza, apologized and cooked me a replacement pizza at no cost.  Both pizzas were good, albeit the first one had some burnt areas that needed to be discarded.

After 30 minutes another two employees came into the restaurant and the flow of traffic and cleanup improved.

I have lived in the neighborhood for about 12 years.  I must say that I am happy to have Momenti down the street.  The pizza and salad is reasonably priced at under ten dollars.  In addition, I enjoy Zoyo's that is next store without a wall in between.
I would say that the restaurant needs some braking in.  However, the pizza is good and the ambiance is even better.  Once the flow of business is improved, you have a winner."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the workers are friendly, that being said everything was overpriced and the workers seemed inexperienced! The pizza was little teeny tiny for 5 bucks-what am I at the airport? Then the salad was like 9 bucks and I could've made it better and have. It was supposed to be like a tomato, cucumber, and red onion salad. Well it was pretty much just tomatoes with like a couple cucumbers slices and no onion. I will say the ingredients were very fresh so that was good. They give u very small dressing for a big salad, which I had to ask for because they forgot and no silverware. They also didn't ask basic things like here or to go, dressing on it or on side.... Also it took a long time for what was made. Probably wont be back here sorry."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first on the taste, but their pizza is delicious! Plus their prices are pretty decent for getting a whole pizza. Tiny slices though...

I found out about this place as I drive by it everyday going home for work. Finally decided to give it a try on my lunch break a couple days ago.

When I walked in it wasn't busy and the front area is the seating area, plus there was no wall to separate it from the business next door which I believe was a yogurt or smoothie shop... so I was a bit confused on where the counter to order was. Kept going back and found the counter. Placed my order (got the pepperoni pizza) and saw them make it right then. No premade pizzas. Not sure how long it took but I would guess about 10mins.

It was a 12\" pizza but the slices are small as I mentioned earlier. The pizza and crust are thin and the crust got a little black. Overall taste was better than I expected. Pizza crust was too crunchy for me though.

I would definitely recommend this pizza place to anyone looking to try a new pizza place or is in the area. I'm planning on taking my husband here next time."}
{"text":"I could end up giving this a place a 4 in the future, but as of now we are at a 3.

Ordered a pizza and salad when we went. They forgot to make the salad, but when i reminded them they were super appologetic about the whole thing. They made it in about 5 minutes and got it out to me asap. I didn't rate low because of that. I just didn't like the pizza we got that much. We had the meat lovers or meaty or whatever the name was. The sausage tasted odd, like it was missing something. There was too much ham on it. It was really greasy (it had lots of meat on it so that is to be expected). The other pizzas we saw out looked much better, so it left us even more dissappointed with our pizza. 

We will definitely go back and get ANOTHER pizza. I just wont get that all meat one again. I have a feeling their other pizza's will help out their grade from me.

Also this is what i would call more of a party/game type pizzas. I wouldn't rate this as a gourmet style pizza (if i was it'd be much lower in ranking). Based on my categorization of pizza per occasion, it is a party/game pizza. I'd recommend it for that setting. Definitely better than other party/game types."}
{"text":"Yeah, really bummed out about this. I was so excited to try this place and it just really disappointed. The pizza was plain and boring. We ordered the sausage and onion one and there was nothing compelling about it. The house salad was great, but I came here for the pizza. Not enough sauce, too much bread. Blah."}
{"text":"During my first Visit here i was great by a very nice girl named taylor. She was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the meat pizza. Taylor charged me and proceeded to make my order. The wait on the pizza was only about five minutes which was a major plus since i was very hungry. Taylor brought me my pizza and a plate and asked me if i need anything else. The pizza came out and it looked just as good as it tasted. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and there was a perfect about of everything. Before leaving taylor asked me how everything was. I told her everything was great. She told me that she was happy to hear I enjoyed my vist. she also told me she was nervous throughout my vist since it was her first day work there. I was blown away, that she did so great on her first day. If you are ever in the area and are wanting pizza you should stop in."}
{"text":"The pizza was just the way I like it. 
Not to thin, not to thick.  It was not drowning in grease like so many other pizza places.  

Recomend the white pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place! Simple and solid pies! Get the best yogurt next door after at Zoyo! :)"}
