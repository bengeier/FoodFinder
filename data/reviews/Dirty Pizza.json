{"text":"Very good. Kept it simple with pepperoni. It appears to be a 1 man operation, but he does well and is friendly even when very busy. Just the simple tasty food you need from time to time."}
{"text":"This place is way better then other places I've been with vegan poutines. Not saying any names though. They give you a huge portion of cheese and gravy. Unlike most places ! 

The street parking sucks all the time. But hopefully you'll find a spot. Seating is limited inside ! But they have a patio in the summer which is always packed and I see why. 

Honestly everything is priced on the menu at a reasonable rate ! The Vegan huge poutine came to $11 and you can share it between 2 people easily ! Bring your appetite these guys don't skim or are cheap. 

My only suggestion don't buy a beverage. It's pretty high the soda ! The owner was there and he's a super cool and funny guy. The decor is super cute and the place is very clean too. 

Also I am not sure if they have a washroom. But try one of their crazy pizzas off the menu or a poutine with these guys you get more then your money's worth. And they love paying extra money for the best ingredients !"}
{"text":"3 stars for the pizza and 1 star for the service.  

Let me be clear I have no issue with the guy who served me, he was friendly and doing his best. However, the owner of this shop is out to lunch.  So it was Saturday evening at 8 PM,  it's the middle of mural fest and it is Grand Prix weekend. There was one guy working in the restaurant!  He was taking orders, manning the cash, serving, prepping the food and he was also the cook. That's right, at peak hours on the busiest night for Montreal restaurants in the entire year there was one person working in the restaurant.  Not the best plan. 

I must admit he handled it well. He was telling people that it would be 25 minutes for a pizza, perhaps up to 45 minutes if you were a group. 

As for the pizza, they have a creative menue consisting of all sorts of dirty options, many of which are available vegetarian.  I went for the all dressed. It was perfectly good. Nothing spectacular,  but would hit the spot if you were hungry and I. The mood for pizza."}
{"text":"I'll start with a clarification! This location USED to be \"Dirty Dogs\", a gourmet hot dogs and pizza place with a surprisingly creative set of vegetarian options. NO LONGER! Dirty Dogs moved onto St Laurent and a bigger space. This address is now DIRTY PIZZA, owned by the same people and applying the same logic (DIRTY!) to pizza rather than dogs. They still have poutine though, making this a great place for the poutine eaters of PQ. 

Poutine: Delicious and great balance of fries/curds/sauce. Sauce itself is vegetarian, so you can order several variations as long as the extra topping isn't meat! Love how it tastes and haven't heard any omnivores complaining about the flavor of the sauce. 

Regular (large) poutine: Very big! 10$ worth is very fair and comparable to what you'd get at other quality poutineries. Two people could split this as long as they aren't uber hungry or huge eaters. I ate a whole one and helped my friend finish hers at one point, but I was starving and we'd been walking around all day.

Small poutine: You get more than you think from looking at the cardboard thing they use to show you the sizes! Probably the right amount of poutine for any single person, definitely more than a snack for most people. 

Pizza: Weird and great! I had the spicy vegetarian one and it was a unique experience with the chipotle sauce. Maybe stick to the simpler ones if you aren't feeling adventurous.

Splitting a large poutine and small pizza is surely enough to feed two people :D

Overall, the staff are very friendly in helping you interpret their wild menu with all it's unique ingredients and detailed photos of the options. 

P.S. Go while summer lasts! Their wooden patio right on Mont Royal is great and it's there all summer :D"}
{"text":"I've had every other variation of the Mac attack from this franchise (burger, poutine, hot dog) and they have all been good just not enough mac and cheese.

Now, it was time for pizza mac and cheese. A true 50/50 for me. Don't like pizza that much, love mac and cheese like it was my child.

The pizza mac attack was good. I enjoyed it more than I would've enjoyed normal pizza but again, the taste of the mac and cheese was overpowered by the pizza side.
It's a recurring problem here that the taste of the mac and cheese is non-existent because what they couple it with is just stronger. 

The only time I actually really tasted their mac and cheese was if I ordered the hot dog or the hamburger and put no other sauces on it. 

I've said this before but they need to add just mac and cheese on their menu. It would be so much better!

The service was medium but there was only one guy to make all the pizza's and man the cashier so I understood. Our pizza came with a slightly burnt crust, but I never eat the crust anyway so it didn't bother me. The guy let us make the pizza half mac attack and half goat cheese. The goat cheese half was actually pretty good! Fresh and tasty. I would get it again."}
{"text":"Best veggie pizza in Montreal! The dude with the blue hair is very cool and hospital."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Service is very friendly and even though there is always one guy in the kitchen and behind the counter too, service is still super quick. 
Great place for Pizza and Poutine.
I love the La WiseGuy pizza and their Classic Poutine."}
{"text":"Located at 25 Avenue du Mont-Royal E, Dirty Pizza is the place to go to for amazing poutine and pizza.  Mount Royal is a major tourist attraction here in Montreal, and you can count on seeing hundreds of people enjoying Tam-Tams every Sunday while the weather allows it.

Being a stone throw away from the mountain, makes this restaurant the ideal place to stop at.  While we were eating, we overheard the passersby say that the food looks so amazing, that they will have to come back.  The customers of the pub next door, kept looking at us while we enjoyed our meals- with looks of envy and jealousy- with good reason.

While the indoor customer capacity is bit limited, it is cozy.  The walls are filled with pictures of celebrities enjoying pizza.  It is fun to try and spot your favorite celebrity while placing your order- which, took us several minutes to do because everything sounded so good.  I had looked at the menu all morning, and I still couldn't decide what I wanted because everything is so appetizing.

We ended up ordering La Angry Goat Pizza (Goat cheese, roasted red peppers, pesto sauce, balsamic reduction),  La K-Pop Pizza (Kimchi, BBQ sauce Dirty Dogs, black sesame seeds), La P.I.G. Mac Poutine (4 Cheese Mac & Cheese, pulled pork, caramelized onions, BBQ sauce Dirty Dogs).

Delicious.

The pizzas are amazing.  Any fan of Kimchi, needs to try the K-Pop Pizza.  It had the perfect amount of heat to compliment the cheese.  Just like many of the dishes, they offer toppings that you can't get at your local pizzeria.  There is a reason they say they offer gourmet meals!

\"I don't think I've ever seen Kimchi as a pizza topping before!\" - A Happy Dirty Pizza Diner

The goat cheese, mixed with arugula on La Angry Goat pizza, was perfect.  Plus, any pesto lover will love the sauce.

If you ever have any issues concerning the toppings, they will work hard to accommodate your needs.  Half and half pizzas, vegan options- they want to ensure that you love your meal.

I will definitely be returning to enjoy several other meals, and I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"The vegan poutine is one of the best meals I had in the city; I'm a true believer now. And the angry goat pizza is making me miss Montreal already. Cute shop, great location, and the owner is a delight to talk to."}
{"text":"Pourquoi le pauvre dude travaille toujours seul? 

Je dis le dude, mais d'une fois à l'autre, je ne le reconnais pas. Je sais juste que 9 fois sur 10 quand j'y vais, il n'y a qu'un employé qui travaille super bien, mais qui doit couvrir tout, du paiement à la préparation des commandes. Le service n'est donc pas épouvantablement long, mais ça pourrait aussi être plus rapide. Mais coudonc, assise sur un des petits tabourets, je passe le temps à faire du \"people-watching\", ce qui n'est jamais ennuyant sur l'avenue Mont-Royal ;) Et puis, quand j'ouvre ma boîte de poutine \"Mac attack\", j'oublie que j'ai été irritée un peu parce c'est une uvre d'art: les frites, la sauce, le bacon, les oignons verts et le macaroni au fromage d'un beau jaune inspirant, haha! Je voudrais vous donner mon avis sur les autres articles du menu, mais ça a été mon premier amour, et il a été si fort que je n'ai jamais été capable d'aller voir ailleurs...

À noter: 

- Pas de toilettes.
- Il y a des places assises mais je ne mangerais pas sur place. C'est coincé, les tabourets sont trop hauts, bof."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place after arriving in Montreal from Ontario and ordered pizza to eat out on the front patio. Really amazing service (cut our pizza into kid-sized slices for my two year old, without us asking) and good tasting food. Pretty great value for a medium pizza that fed all three of us."}
