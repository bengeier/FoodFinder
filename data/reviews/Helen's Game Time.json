{"text":"I had their honey lemon pepper wing omg. Mouth watering extra crunchy good best wings I have ever tasted period. Keep up the good work and I'll keep spreading the good word."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town and stop and visit Helen's for 1 reason....the honey lemon pepper chicken wings! They are unique and extremely delicious!!! It's an added soon to regular lemon pepper dry rub seasoning. The atmosphere is chill. Can get really busy on the weekends. Drinks are on point. Ample parking. TV's, pool table & VIP area. Only downside is not much seating (outside of at bar or VIP) so difficult to sit & enjoy food when it's crowded so I usually take it to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday evening, and the service was abysmal. Drinks were strong, lots of parking around back and a nicely decorated interior tho."}
{"text":"Great service, it's a great place to watch the game and grab some good food.   There is ample parking too"}
{"text":"Horrible...will never go back to this hood ass place again..lol  I went based on the reviews and let me tell you..people are lying their ass off.  Food was horrible...beer choices limited and I won't get started on the service.  I told a buddy of mine that grew up on the eastside that I went and he was like \"Should've called me first...stay the hell outta there\""}
{"text":"The food is delish and the service is okay. On Wednesdays they have a 10 wings for $5 special and have Happy Hour M-F parking is not an issue and this would be a great place to catch the game. I would definitely come back!"}
