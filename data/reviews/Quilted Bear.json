No?

No?

Then you really shouldn't go to the Quilted Bear. It smells like old people. Honestly, I can't even remember what I got. Maybe a chicken salad sandwich. 
I was so overwhelmed by the 70+ average age, the wicker chairs and fake dusty ivy everywhere that I couldn't hardly stand it."}

I was saddened at how horrific this geriatric hot spot was, and I'm definitely not surprised that this place is now closed. 

Unfortunately I made the decision to try this place out. I have no idea why. 

My friend ordered a sandwich. That's pretty much all there is to say about it. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, and he immediately regretted it. 

I made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta. It looked as though it had come from a can, a freshly opened can nonetheless, hence the one star. I couldn't eat it without the gag reflex setting in. 

The interior made me feel strange and awkward with wooden bear figurines, bad seating, fake foliage, doily tablecloths and hanging needlepoint pictures.

Well Quilted Bear, if anything, you left a strong impression in my mind as well as some comic relief every now and then when I drive by your outdated sign--still wondering what heck possessed me to walk though those disgusting doors. RIP, Quilted Bear."}
{"text":"It's really not as bad as the other reviewer stated. Granted there is a certain Geritol feel to it, but 70 in fact is not that old. Specially when you're fast approaching 50. 

There are a lot more exciting places to eat within a few blocks, but I'm old, and I like restaurants that serve good tasting food. Not foo-foo food. You know, Gorgonzola Cheese Quesadillas with Tuna Tartar. Give me a burger or a Pastrami Sandwich (with only pickles and mustard) any day of the week over the foo-foo crap. 

And Quilted Bear does. 

Good soups, good sandwiches, and a decent salad bar. A nice quiet place to have a nice lunch."}
