{"text":"I visited this place on Saturday, and it was my first time purchasing an item there. I looked around the store for some junk food first before moving into their deli section.

For some of the chocolates, crakers, etc. that I looked at it was difficult to discern what it was or tasted like. Many of the junk foods had pictures, but as they deal largely with imported European foods, the packages don't always have English on them - they often do, but not always.

I settled on some crackers that said graham on them, but afterwards when I opened them up they didn't look or taste anything like our traditional western graham crackers. They didn't taste bad, but I include this point to signify the usefulness of English on the packages.

I also purchased 200g of cheese. I couldn't read the languague on any of the cheeses so I asked a lady to pair a good cheese with my crackers... yes, I asked for a good cheese pairing with my graham crackers. I got some sheepish looks but given my question I think it was fair. I got 200g of a mild cheese and it tasted pretty good.

I didn't recognize any cuts of meats that were chicken or turkey and so I didn't explore any of those offerings. It seemed like this was the busiest part of the store. If you don't speak the language many of the ladies use (I didn't recognize it) they do speak English and are helpful.

I left with my cheese, graham crackers, some Sesame Snaps candy and the cost was a little over $8. Not bad considering 2 of the 3 items bought were imported."}
{"text":"I found this deli a few years ago and I have to say the variety and quality of meats, cheeses and assorted polish treats are exceptional however, the reason why I'm only giving a rating of 3 stars is that the last few times I have gone (3), the person helping me has repeatedly gone over the desired quantity of product that I had wanted. If you decide to give this deli a try, make sure you keep an eye on the scale!"}
