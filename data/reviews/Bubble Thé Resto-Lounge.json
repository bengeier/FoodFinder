{"text":"Their bubble tea is very mediocre, however the food was nicely prepared. I had the Salt & Pepper Pork and it was a little bit over-fried, was difficult to chew.

What I didn't appreciate is that my spoon was not properly washed. It had pieces of dried eggs on it... They did gave me a new one but come on, wash your utensils properly.

Good food, but was disappointed in the hygiene."}
{"text":"This is a review for just the tea, not the food. The tea is excellent and there are tons of options. You can specify exactly the type of tea, level of sweetness, and type of pearls you want, and prices are reasonable. Perfect for a cold winter day."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure! This place has a run-down sign in the front (a giant boba cup), but you'll feel like you've been portaled into a chic Chinese cafe upon entering! I came in for breakfast, and had their waffle and fruit plate - delish! And they didn't skimp on the fruit as a lot of places do! My meal included a choice of drinks... and I got the Taiwanese-style Black Milk Tea.  Good stuff man! This place offers a vast menu, so there's something for everyone!  Great service! Free Wi-Fi!  My favorite part was their washroom...LOL... of all things!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars for their bubble tea and appetizers, but a 3 for their main dishes. I highly recommend coming here for just their drinks and snacks mostly because the 2 times I've been here, the mains were not that special. It was actually tasteless in fact. I had the black bean noodles the last time I went, and before that I had the spicy chicken dish. Both were just really average, maybe even below average.

But! Their bubble tea was consistently good the 3 times I have gone. I ordered the milk green tea and the original milk black tea. It's not too sweet like how some places make it. Just perfect! 

I do have to warn you all though, the last time I went the lounge smelled like public toilets.  To be fair, this is the first time it has ever smelled like that. What's funny is the bathroom door was apparently closed when the smell was around. So how does that work?

Anyways, definitely come here for bubble tea and snacks. It's worth it. They have a great variety of drinks like smoothies, shaved ice etc. Plus they have comfortable couch chairs!"}
{"text":"The lumpiest fresh taro tea I've ever had!! The lumps were so big they did not fit in the straw.  I basically just drank sweet milk and tapioca bubbles after fishing out the lumps that is.  The good thing is they have a big selection of bubble tea to choose from.  Very nice and polite staff.  Affordable.

The popcorn chicken was very hard but still unpleasantly chewy somehow.  Just like bad bar food.The fried dumplings were made in house and frozen. They tasted real bad.  If you feel like dumplings go to Qinghua Dumpling or Sammi & Soupe Dumpling not here! Eggplant tempura was the best thing I ate.  Still, I prefer the tempura at Ganadara.

Sadly there's no reason for me to go there again. :("}
{"text":"Worst bubble tea/ dessert place ever. The dessert they offer are small portion and expensive; and they taste nothing like what it is suppose to be.

The service is slow with attitude. 

I went there with my boyfriend and felt glad there is an asian dessert place in town. the price is ridiculously high but we really wanted it so we gave it a try.  But how disappointed we were. Aside the price is basically a whole lunch meal  but the portion is a small rice bowl of whatever. 

When it come to taste, we don't expect it to be like the tradition one but at least maybe slightly good? But it taste like sugar and water. Very very disappointed. 

Never going back. Good luck on business."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive for a hole-in-the-wall! I absolutely urge patrons to try their savory foods (not just the desserts and teas - which are pretty decent; the only drawback is that it's fifty cents extra for tapioca balls in the tea, which I think should be standard, so one star off for that).
Otherwise, great fresh juices, probably the best congee in Montreal, very hearty noodle soup, and pretty nice dumplings. They will spice things up if you ask. The staff is quite efficient and courteous! Between ordering and leaving (including being seated), the total time spent here was almost an hour. We not only did not feel rushed, but we actually got to relax and enjoy our order. I will go back simply to try their wings. Overall, check it out!"}
