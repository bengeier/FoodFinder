{"text":"The food here is good, but, here is a pet peeve:

Why would an Indian restaurant serve iceberg lettuce salad with Italian dressing as a side? Yes, I know it is cheep, but c'mon, the taste palette is completely different. I hate it when chinese/korean/indian take-out does this, and they do it often.

The Indian food here is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I *love* Tamarind! I am a vegan and Tamarind has a vegan and a vegetarian meal option every day. After 3pm they have a $5 mini-meal which comes with rice and a salad. The portion is pretty big and I get this all the time to take home for dinner!

The food is delicious and the menu changes daily. I had breakfast there one morning which was also delicious! If you are in the BCE Place food court I definitely recommend that you check this place out."}
{"text":"Generous portions at an affordable price...the rice is fresh and fluffy although their coconut fish was surprisingly made with salmon which was odd to me (not to mention lacking in coconut flavour). The paneer, however, is delicious with just the right amount of kick."}
{"text":"Checked out this place today. Absolutely no salt in that Chettinad Chicken. Seriously, I never tasted such a saltless and bland chettinad chicken.  The food looked awesome & I was excited when I bought it but when I ate it -- damn, I wasted by 12 bucks on a saltless Indian dish. I want my money back Tamarind."}
{"text":"Love this place, I go after work quite frequently.  Food is always good, the staff are friendly and every time I go let me know of any specials or deals they have on.  When I ask for take away they always offer to wrap everything up in cellophane to insure nothing leaks on my walk home.

The portions are also generous and I always have enough left over for lunch the next day.
I should note I am also vegetarian and they have a lot of great, delicious vegetarian and vegan options that change up every day.

good food, good price, very friendly staff, I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for good Indian food in the downtown core.  I agree with other posters this is also the best place for food in BCE place."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter takes my phone when I show him the mobile express groupon voucher and clicks 'used' without taking the voucher number(tells me he doesn't 'take' the voucher #), then refuses to honor it when I show him what he's done (without letting him touch my phone again this time)... then when I tell him he needs to learn how 'vouchers work' he threatens me with having security make me leave :S  I'm a mom of 2 teens and he's acting like I'm out of control... I haven't even raised my voice at this point.. but you can bet right after he threatened me.  Unbelivably rude and he acted like I was some kind of crook and was trying to rip him off. For a lousy Biryani? So he rips me off as I've paid for my 'meal' and he's refusing to serve me cause I won't give him my phone again... He kept acting like I did something wrong and he didn't do anything.. I will never go there and I will make sure the net knows how ignorant and nasty he is to customers"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their paneer! I've gone three times already this week, and there's always a different paneer of the day. The food is delicious, the naan is fresh and the prices are very affordable. The butter chicken is also quite tasty. Staff are also very friendly and helpful in navigating you through the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to other indian food outlets in Toronto and would rate Tamarind as the best. The food is very delicious and the staff is welcoming and friendly. I eat here quite often and the best thing I like about them is their willingness to get customer feedback and continiouly adding new varieties of Indian food to their menu..I would highly recommend it to people who have better sense of real Indian food.."}
{"text":"I went to Tamarind hoping to eat some good Indian food. The place is in the food court and seemed to be one of the less busier spots when i went. I ordered a vegetarian biryani, a veggie side (aloo jalfrezi) and a samosa. After taxes, it costed me $11.94. That was the WORST Indian food I have eaten in quite sometime. Save yourself the effort, even if you're craving Indian food and go to some of the nicer spots around. The taste and the cost probably explain why its not that busy compared to the other joints in the food court."}
{"text":"I checked this place out today. Got one of their mini meals with Dhaal. Gosh - the dhaal was super salty. A definite \"avoid at all cost\" place for me!"}
{"text":"Delicious butter chicken! It is really soft and not too spicy. The nice gentleman let us eat some samples which made choosing the chicken easy. Careful about the chickpeas! They are a little spicy!

The rice is soft and a little sweet. Good stuff! A nice dinner to eat up before going home from Union station."}
{"text":"Today I am bestowing upon Tamarind a highly sought-after and equally prestigious honor of The Best Place to Eat in BCE Place.

The portions are generous, the food is flavorful and the menu changes daily, although there are some items that are always there, like lentil curry.  The naan is made fresh and always hot when they give it to you.

Extra bonus: the have Dr Pepper (look for my highly anticipated forthcoming list: eateries in Toronto that serve Dr Pepper).

If you go for dinner, they have a special and it's cheaper.  I think they're open til 6:30, so at that hour they're competing with the quality establishments of McDonald's and Subway.

They're having some sort of 1-year anniversary thing in April so you can get a free lunch, or so I've heard.  Coupons will be available on their Facebook page."}
{"text":"As a proud Indian, how dare the owners call the food they serve 'Indian'. I understand that they're trying to adhere to western tastes and cook the food on the milder side. But that doesn't mean the food needs to be absolutely bland and tasteless. Care to put some salt and pepper maybe? Tried the chickpea, and chicken curries. It was just bland and the chicken was extremely dry. The Naan - don't even get me started. The texture was very thick, rubbery and served stone-cold. I understand this is mall fast food so my expectations aren't high. But I highly suggest that the owners visit a respectable dhabha (roadside fast food joint) in India and learn a few things about North Indian cuisine. Actually on second thoughts, no need to go to india. Just go to Manchu wok or mucho burrito next door and get an idea of how food can be edible with some sense of taste without necessarily being spicy!!"}
{"text":"This is the best butter chicken I've ever had. It's slightly sweet, not too thin, and the portion of meat is glorious. The price and portion for around $9 plus free salad is amazing. This is better than the restaurants hands down."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite lunch places in the path. The butter chicken here is very good and they have a daily paneer special. For an extra dollar  (depending on what you order) you get a big side of chickpeas or kidney beans, which is a great deal. Their nan is fresh and goes great with the curry."}
{"text":"Well I've never eaten a full meal here, but it's on my way home, so I grab some evening snacks every now and then, and they're quite authentic. They have some good Indian street food specials every month, which I've liked to far - wada pao etc. Samosas are quite decent for $1."}
{"text":"Tamarind at the food court in Brookfield is so slow. The line here is usually long, but the line also moves at a snail's pace. I had a craving for Indian food and was willing to wait a bit. When I arrived at the counter, I ordered the butter chicken with naan. If you order with rice, you generally get more. The container for curry when you order with naan is much smaller and only partially filled. The person at the counter asked if I wanted vegetables, I said yes. She went back to get some more containers and showed up after I finished paying then apologized. I never ended up getting the vegetables.

The butter chicken was at the right spice level. However, it was sweet as well, which wasn't what I was expecting. The naan bread was good. Although the food was tasty, I didn't think the food was worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"Its a food court joint, but its good. I totally agree the portions are generous and their naan bread is yumm.

I ordered their chicken tikka and found it a little dry, but the naan and lassi total made up for it. Lassi is an extra $2, and so are the vegetables."}
