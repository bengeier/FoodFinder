{"text":"I had my birthday dinner with my gf here. Very pleasant experience. Great food and great service here. The server even asked me if I wanted to switch to a table beside window. And the whole restaurant sang bday song for me, it was winter but I felt so warm."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service! Great find. Thanks yelpers for helping us find this authentic French restaurant."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR EVENING - there are FAR better french restaurants for the pleasure and your money. Where to start. It is weak at best - mediocrity disguised behind Parisienne accents. The wait for our table (made a rez and still waited over 10 minutes), left us standing in the centre of the cramped space, obtrusively above other people's tables and repeatedly shuffled about so that the waiters could pass by us. Then... I was told on the phone I was getting this lovely table at the window overlooking the park...erase the image that comes to mind. The \"lovely\" window was like sitting at a 70's doctor's office window. The \"view\" was just our reflection caused by the glaring pot light directly above my head (actually had a spider thread hanging from it - I felt like I was about to be interrogated)! Seriously, Madame et Monsieur, you can't charge 34 dollars for Filet Mignon and make your clients walk past an open closet with a dirty vacuum cleaner and a jumble of racks to get to a washroom straight out of a soviet block apartment - replete with dirty plunger in full view! Our guests actually made a joke about the bathrooms and that joke took us to hilarity about the entire experience - it was like something straight out of Faulty Towers. The food - yeesh, boring at best, Hy's steak style seasonings and 80's style presentation. Toronto is a foodie haven, there is no need to wast an evening here."}
{"text":"Unpretentious place with great food, without a doubt you can taste France in every of their dishes."}
{"text":"Sacre bleu! Having searched on Yelp about this place prior to going I was expecting a lot as this was the first restaurant I was led to solely due to Yelp raiting. And it managed to exceed our expectations!  We had veal, pork tenderloin and shared mussels for appetizer. They were all delicious. I had the veal, which was juicy and had interesting sauce. Pork tenderloin was yummy too as it was tender. The mussels didn't leave anthing to be desired either. They were really fresh and the broth tasted so good.  The restaurant is a romantic place perfect for dates. It is a bit crammed but that's where intimate ambiance comes from. Service was perfect too. Our server was professional and friendly.   I'll be coming here very often!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service. A bit of an older/refined crowd."}
{"text":"The food look great but taste awful, soup is very bitter, meat is plain, I came to this place because of the good reviews here.   The service is by far the worst in yorkville, I saw mostly middle age and old people who come to this place, if you look young and not French, you should probably avoid this place. The waitress we got looks like a boy and she was awful, my friend and I got mistreated the whole night, she gave window seats to 2 different couples who look rich despite the fact we came in first and asked for it first and had an appointment, our glasses were empty the whole night until another waitress was called for help, her apology in the end didn't really make a difference, on the other hand, the other young lady was very nice, attentive and friendly, I don't remember her name, maybe Alex, get her instead if you are visiting this place.  The appearance of the food is important but taste obvious is far more important for me, everything taste bitter and I really don't enjoy bitter dishes. This was not a good experience, hope other people don't have to go through what we've been through."}
{"text":"We came here before. Each time is really enjoyable food. It is a family business and people takes food seriously. I had the green salad and the French Onion soup. My husband had the daily soup of mushroom soup and the salad Nicoise. We both are very satisfied. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I've passed this space so many times but never would I think to venture up those stairs.  Very french, not chic by any means and tiny as can be.    The desserts alone make me think I need to venture back but I popped in for a quick bite and enjoyed the soup, which they claim is the best french onion in the city and their quiche which was NOT overcooked like so many I have had.  We were beyond full and pleasantly surprised with the cheque but so tempted by dessert offerings.   Cute 'hidden' spot."}
{"text":"A small cozy restaurant hidden on the second floor of a building in Yorkville. This family business is quite close to celebrate its 40 year anniversary since its establishment in 1978. Went there for a weekend lunch on my own.  Starting with the baguette - to be a bit nitpicking the butter served was cold (although it was nicely shaped / presented to be like a swirl or flower?), personally I preferred the butter could be served a bit softer.  Didn't try their French onion soup but instead I got the daily soup of carrot and ginger, and it turned out to be quite hearty - especially in a day when the temperature drastically dropped to be below 10.  Salaid Nicoise - instead of using tuna they put a piece of fresh salmon over the bed of vegetable. I like the way the salmon was cooked - not dry or overly salted, but kept the flavor / texture of the fish itself.  Chose dark chocolate mousse as the dessert, which tasted decent as well. Actually I was quite lucky to get a table close to where they left the tart / pies, and the waiter showed me all of them one by one when I was selecting the desert.  The place appeared to be family friendly as I did see kids coming together with their parents. Not too many young folks were there though. The service and the whole atmosphere were nice and friendly. Will probably come back again to try other of their dishes."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a celebration dinner with my girlfriend. Pretty no frills stuff, but the place looks clean and simple, instead of dressing itself up. I can respect that.  The service was quite nice throughout our meal and not very disruptive. Had the Rainbow Trout and Pork Tenderloin.  Fish was very fresh and cooked perfectly, while the tenderloin was indeed tender and flavorful, with a delicious mustard sauce on top.   For dessert, we had a meringe. Not too sweet, even when paired with the caramel and sweet white sauce that accompanied it.  While nothing utterly blew me away, I was still impressed by the unpretentious, but very yummy food. I can definitely see why it's been around for over 35 years!  For my full review of Jacques's Bistro, please check out my food blog, located conveniently in my profile. Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, great service, pretty good food"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight for my birthday with my parents and younger brother.  The food was excellent, all around, and the waitresses were very friendly and beautiful.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is cozy and intimate, but a little restricting.  The view overlooking Village of Yorkville Park is also wonderful.  As for the food: I started with Le filet de truite fumée (Fillet of smoked trout with warm salad of french lentils, beetroot horseradish) for an appetizer, which was tasty, but my main course was delicious.  For that I had L'entrecôte au poivre vert (New York sterling silver striploin 8-oz in a green peppercorn sauce).  That was definitely one of the best steak dinners I have ever had in my life.  The meat was perfectly cooked and very flavourful and the roasted vegetables were also fantastic.  Lastly, for desert I had ÎLes Flottantes (soft meringue floating on English custard, almonds, caramel and fresh fruits).  This was amazing and very rich; though not quite as rich as the restaurant's clientele.  My family and I all thoroughly enjoyed the food and service and will probably be back again after our wallets recover from the trauma they were subjected to when the bill came.  My only complaint is that our dinners weren't complimentary.  What's up with that?!  ;-)"}
{"text":"The food and the ambience were both amazing.  The staff were really friendly and gave good recommendations for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Of course, the ambiance is quite nostalgic, and the patrons are all reaching their upper years, actually my friend and I were the youngest people there! Definitely, reservations on the weekend are a MUST, as people tend to linger, which you can't blame them for when the warm, hot bread is so delicious!!! The service is impeccable, the first time in a long time anyone has offered to hang my coat, and the food is absolutely authentic French! I had the mussels for $13 and my friend had the lobster omelette for $19. The mussels came in a rich, citrusy sauce that went heavenly with the warm bread. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Except for one time, I have always dined here when I visit the city. Although I have enjoyed the food, I have been coming here for the service. As I stated previously, if I wanted to impress someone, I would take that person here.  On this visit, in addition to the soup du jour, I had ordered the special which was the filet mignon. It was a mistake only because I had no room for dessert. I had to settle for coffee. As I thought I was going to get the check, I was served with complimentary profiteroles.  You come here initially for the food. You will make repeated visits due to the service."}
{"text":"I have been here many times in my day but I haven't been for years.  This place isn't street level and isn't really easy to find if you weren't looking for it but it's a quaint place that while it may be French doesn't make you feel out of place.    Jacque's Bistro Du Parc while they do serve French cuisine is actually rather affordable for as it has a great ambiance and feel and location but really makes you feel welcome.  I will admit I'm not a fancy guy.  I don't live rich and this place is a real treat for the break of everyday meals because French is not something I have a chance to have everyday or even every month.    The menu for lunch is lighter fare such as omelettes, soups, salads.  I went with a salmon.  I had just had smoked salmon for breakfast a few hours earlier but I was on a fish kick considering I hadn't had it in a while and it was a Friday.    Prior to the meal coming out the server came back twice to give me some hot French stick which is just a treat with butter.  Nothing says French like a piece of warm French stick with butter.    When my meal came it was just what I had wanted for lunch, a nice butter and basil sauce and 2 nice pieces of fresh salmon.  The potatoes were toasted and hot and everything was just dressed in that wonderful butter.  French cuisine has a lot of butter sometimes, and this was no exception.    I hardly drink white wine because I prefer red but I did have a nice dry white with this meal and it complimented the dish quite nicely.  For a nice change of pace, Jacque's Bistro is just that.  A quiet, classy place with a nice space and friendly staff all overlooking the big Cumberland Rock across the street."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last week and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. My server looked very familiar and I was racking my brain trying to figure out where I know him from. It turns out we attended the same university and he was a few years older than me. What a small world.   There really is a Jacques. My server's parents are from France and have owned this wonderful little hidden gem in Yorkville for 36 years. I have walked by several times, but have never noticed this place. Thank goodness for the Yelp app! In addition to the stellar reviews on Yelp, the restaurant has received many accolades from Zagat and Toronto Life Magazine and I can see why.  My server informed me that the french onion soup is among the best in the city and I opted for the dish, which didn't disappoint. It was hearty, chock full of cheese, and very delicious. I was quite hungry and also ordered the steak. The medium New York sterling silver striploin was accompanied with green peppercorn sauce and scrumptious fried potatoes and vegetables. As per the recommendation from a fellow Yelper,  dessert was a must. So, I asked my server to kindly brown bag the steak, as it was quite a large meal. For dessert, my server recommended the lemon tart and he described it as eating a cloud. It was so delicious and the lemon was not too overpowering, as so many lemon tarts can be. It was fluffy and moist and just incredible! He also brought me a sample of the caramelized apple tart with warm sauce, which was also extremely delightful! All desserts are made in house.   I received wonderful service and it was nice to chat with a friendly former alumnus. I will definitely be returning for some authentic French food. The only thing that needs updating is the outdated decor, especially the wallpaper. Otherwise, the restaurant is very intimate and cozy. I highly recommend Jacques' Bistro du Park!"}
{"text":"very cute Parisian restaurant tucked inside yorkville located on the second floor. The food was perfect and the ambience was amazing, and the owners took the time to come out to greet us this cute restaurant reminds me of Paris...."}
{"text":"Jacques bistro is a small, intimate restaurant in Yorkville with some of the best French food in the city.   My father swears by their French onion soup and after tasting everything my family ordered last time, I can accurately say that just about everything is good.  The only downside is that the place is small and if you arrive later in the night some of the incredible desserts may have already been finished. That said, I did learn that if you are smart you order your dessert of choice when you make your reservation and they will make sure they save you one for your meal."}
{"text":"A very nice quaint restaurant on the second floor. Excellent service!!! Family run with no pretense with the Food; It's French comfort food for the palate and soul.   The only thing that I wish they had was more Canadian wines to pair with their menu.    My family and I just got in from in from Calgary and this was our first meal and it was very delicious.   Martine and her staff were very hospitable and accommodating in giving us ideas on what to see and do on our visit in Toronto"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food at this restaurant, classic french cooking. The decor needs a serious make over, it is very dated with the flowery wallpaper. Not a hot-spot in any sense of the term but still located in the heart of Yorkville. Very unpretentious and a nice place to just sit and enjoy the meal. Very casual atmosphere overall.  The staff were quite friendly.  I plan on returning."}
{"text":"The rainbow trout was awesome!   Two of three people loved the Onion Soup, Not me. But it's a real French Bistro that you have to try."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The best French Bistro I have been to. French onion soup, mussels and the steak was a perfect meal."}
{"text":"What a GREAT restaurant. A hidden gem right in Yorkville. My wife was reminded of this restaurant back in December when she a meeting in Yorkville & walked by the restaurant. She recalled that, years ago when she worked in the neighbourhood, she frequented this place for lunch often. She said she loved the French Onion Soup & the omelets. So, this past Saturday, she suggested we go & try the place for dinner. We made a reservation for 7PM & were seated right on time as we arrived. Everything positive you read in previous reviews is correct. Service is extremely good. Food is excellent &, although I was too full to try any dessert, all the deserts I saw being served to other tables looked fantastic.  I had the filet mignon on the special board with a mushroom soup (daily special) as my appetizer. Every single bite of my meal, filet, potatoes, vegetables & the soup was perfect! My wife had the French Onion soup & the veal medallions. Her veal was served in the same, excellent demi glace my filet was. I tied my wife's soup & her veal- both beyond reproach. Small, cozy room. Simple, well-executed menu. Service above normal- suitable for a high-end restaurant. This place is GREAT & I will be going here often, for sure."}
{"text":"An extremely authentic French food that is tucked on the second floor in Cumberland. Onion soup was perfect, not salty and despite cheese, it does not feel heavy at all. Had pan seared scallops and it was a good size portion. The warm baguette with sumptuous butter was to die for. Prices of bottles wine, though a bit limited in choice,  are extremely reasonable. Tarte tartin a la mode ended my dinner on a high note!   The service was impeccable and extremely friendly. This is a family business and one would always feel welcomed! Two thumbs up and would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance. Small restaurant located upstairs of Yorkville. I thought it was kind of pricey for normal French food. They also ran out of the rabbit when I was there. Lots of omelets on the menu for some reason. Wine was surprisingly bad @ this French restaurant. Service was great thought."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends, who recommended we try this place.  Four of us walked in without a reservation, and the wait was only 10 minutes. It is a very small cozy place on the second floor.  We got seated by the window, so we had an amazing view from the restaurant.  The food: Although I wanted to get the french onion soup, I got the goat cheese ratatouille quiche, which was delicious! The crust was perfect, and all the ingredients blended so well together.  My other friends got omelettes and they likes theirs as well.  Next time I will definitely go for the French onion soup:)"}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews but I had such a great experience eating at Jacques that I need to share. My bf and I came to Toronto to visit and we wanted to experience what French fine dining is like here. Boy, were we impressed by not only the exceptional service we had, but the delicious food!   The restaurant is very small (only 11 tables) so make sure to make a reservation right away! We almost didn't get a chance to eat here because we called late. The restaurant gives you a feeling of being home in someone's dining room, the staff is very attentive and knowledgeable from the moment you enter to the moment you leave. We are from NYC and honestly I have never received such amazing service (we were walked to the door upon our exit, our waiter held the door for us and gave us recommendations during our stay here in Toronto)  For dinner we both had the French onion soup (5/5). I loved this soup, the cheese was rich and creamy, freshly stretching out as you ate, even the bread was delicious. I felt sad that I couldn't finish it because it was just too filling!   Our next course was the spinach bacon salad (4/5). We shared this plate and it was enough for both of us. This was good but it lacked some flavor and needed just a bit more dressing in my opinion.   My boyfriend got the chef's special filet migon (5/5). He loved it! The meat was cooked to his liking perfectly and it melted in your mouth. Every dish comes with roasted potatoes and vegetables which were cooked and seasoned very well.  I ordered the pork tenderloin in a mustard sauce (4.5/5). The sauce was very delicious!! But some of the pieces of pork were a little dry for me.   For dessert we shared the chocolate mousse (4/5), it was very rich but the flavor could've been a little better.  Overall, we enjoyed our time dining here and will definitely be visiting again whenever we're back in this beautiful city! Thank you Jacques! Adieu!"}
{"text":"French fine dining experience where French is also encouraged. Nice little spot almost hidden away. Apparently Toronto Life Magazine voted them best French onion soup in the city.  start off by saying this is on Cumberland West of Bay and is on the north side. it's on the second floor of a tight building space and if you blink you'll miss it. have to take the stairs.  right away greeted with a wait staff that speaks French and English and a cost check. Very warm vibe with a slightly older demographic that visits but not to worry.  They have daily specials of which had the Venison Sirloin, French Onion Soup and Lemon tart. Have to say, in an area where they are competing with multiple French fine dining restaurants, this place holds it own and offers a pleasant experience.  food was very rich and true to the cuisine and atmosphere was very welcoming. the wine list was actually pretty food value and paired well. was happy to come here during a weeknight dinner for a small celebration with a work colleague and impressed that it does its best to live up to the experience the area is known for in French cuisine.  giving it a 3.5 rounded up to 4.0."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and was not disappointed! Very small intimate venue. Amazing food. Great staff! Did I mention the food was incredible? Definitely will bring my wife here next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"In all honesty, Jacques Bistro deserves a 5 star rating and it saddens me that my review cannot reflect this. The quality, presentation, and taste of their food is superb. The service is also amazing with friendly, talkative staff and a coat hanging service.   My friends and I went to this restaurant for lunch and I had the asparagus soup and les crevettes à l'ail. The soup was delicious and I finished it within seconds. It also came with bread which I felt was relatively hard. Les crevettes à l'ail was an omelette with many small shrimps and garlic inside. It also tasted wonderful and I didn't even need ketchup! (ps they are too fancy for ketchup)  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and is relatively small. The majority of customers are older people and the service was very professional. My friend was going to put his napkin on his lap and the waiter interrupted him. He said, \"Non monsieur, allow me.\", he then proceeded to unfolded the napkin and place it for my friend. Talk about service.   My satisfaction and overall experience of Jacques was great. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for my friend. He ate their mussels and perhaps they were not cooked well but he experienced food poisoning and was ill for a couple of days. Regardless, we both agree that Jacques is worth a visit, just stay away from the mussels!"}
{"text":"Just visited this restaurant with my husband last night and it was absolutely amazing! The service is so friendly right from the moment you walk in. The restaurant is very small, maybe about 30 seats, which makes it very cozy and a great place to actually have a conversation. We started with the French onion soup which was hearty, very flavourful, and had the BEST (and so much!) cheese. Our main was a filet mignon which was cooked to perfection, and we ended with a lemon tart (delicious!) and berries on ice cream. Their desserts are made in house and I could not make up my mind do the server showed me every dessert! It was our anniversary so they wrote \"congratulations\" on our dessert plates which was so sweet of them, and the owner offered us two glasses of champagne to toast. Such a wonderful way to end an already amazing dinner. I didn't want to review them because I wanted to keep this place all to myself, but I just had to as they truly deserve many more years of success. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've always dined in Yorkville but I've never noticed this place as it's on the second floor of some other stores. It's a small dainty restaurant so ensure you make reservations as the place fills up quick. The service was great, they were very welcoming and accommodating as possible such as trying to see if a table was free as we came early for our reservations. The food was amazing. The escargot are bigger compared to others and they provide 6. The entrees were cooked perfectly, meat was tender and juicy. The waiter was great by offering to take pictures of my boyfriend and I. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"A petite restaurant tucked away on the 2nd floor in the heart of Yorkville.   A friend and I wandered in after fighting the bitter cold on Christmas Eve, foolishly realizing that nearly everything was closed, including Pho Hung, which was our original destination! Good thing the sandwich board caught our eye and saved us another 10 minutes of walking!  The menu is quite limited, due to the fact that the kitchen itself is not much bigger than a basic walk-in closet. There were only about a dozen items, not including the last page, which listed a variety of specialty omelets.* As well, it was noted at the bottom of the menu that there were additional charges for dishes shared between people.   Since my dietary needs didn't exactly allow me to choose anything else, I went with a simple omelet with Swiss cheese and a variety of mushrooms**.   Wow! It must have been soaked in butter! Even the four or so pieces of vegetables - zucchini, carrot, to name a few - cut finely and most likely grilled with tongs, were dancing in my mouth! I wanted to lick my plate so badly, but refrained. Health considerations aside, the amount of butter was probably what sold me on my food! My friend, a former chef, ordered a French onion soup and a quiche, which he was both satisfied with. I did try the quiche and thought that the crust was nicely done.  Our bill came to approximately $45 for an orange juice, a soup and two entrees. The owner politely helped fetch my jacket from the back corridor and made a small effort to thank us as we left. I know I'll be coming back here for another buttery omelet! _________________________________ * Omelets starts at around $12. ** Can't remember what kind there were. There may have been a few slices of porcini."}
{"text":"C'est magnifique!  As a francophile I enjoyed this wonderful bistro and highly recommend it!    The food was delicious and the service was very friendly.  The \"soupe à l'oignon gratinée\" was a tasty appetizer to start the meal.  My pork tenderloin dish had a hearty sauce that was the perfect complement.  My fiancée's trout dish was tenderly cooked and she enjoyed it thoroughly.  The dessert which caped off the evening's meal, was a \"tarte tatin\" which had sweet apples and a crispy pie crust, with a vanilla ice cream \"à la mode.\"  Yum!  The family-run restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere and, fortunately for me, were willing to suffer through my poor French.  They recommended excellent courses and the cuisine reminded me of the dishes I enjoyed in Paris last year.  I was especially glad to try a \"tarte tatin\" dessert since I never tried it when vacationing in France.    So go try this restaurant!  It's on the second floor, up a flight of stairs.  \"Jacques' Bistro\" is located just north of a quaint park.    Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"When you a climb a certain flight of stairs about midway down Cumberland Avenue in the Yorkville section of Toronto, and you open the door, it's almost as if you travelled instantly to Paris.      Actually, you have.      Welcome to Jacques Bistro du Parc. It is an authentic French eatery founded by Jacques and Martine Sorin nearly 40 years ago (1978). Jacques' is a Francophile's delight.       From the French onion soup, omelettes, chicken dishes, mussels, desserts...this is the real deal. If you have never been to France, do go here to experience real French cooking.     Been to France and and miss French cuisine? By all means, make a reservation and enjoy.      BTW- The staff is absolutely delightful. They are happy to indulge us when we brush off our high school French and take it out for a spin in their presence.       I give Jacques Bistro du Parc 10 stars! If you go to Jacques, I guarantee you will go back, again and again, as we do.      If you see a red headed woman with long curly hair and a bald man with a white goatee at Jacques attempting to speak French with the staff you'll know it's we having a great time. So, please stop by our table and say \"Bon soir, mes amis.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner  upon a friend's recommendation, hopeful for French cuisine as lovely as we'd had in Paris. We were pretty happy with what we got! The french onion soup was heavenly, and our entrees - a salad nicoise and an omelette, were both delicious. The service was great but not disruptive - my husband and I were able to share fairly uninterrupted conversation while having all our dinner related needs met."}
{"text":"This place is actually the best place in the world to bring your grandparents. Everything about it screams senior citizen, except of course for the steep flight of stairs up to the second floor. If your grandma can walk up stairs, and has a lot of money, this is the place for her.   The thing is, I don't really mean this as a negative thing. There is a need for all kinds of restaurants, and this is one that caters to a much older crowd. That being said, the food is good, and the service is great too - but I wouldn't bring a hot date here - it's not really the place for a \"night out on the town\".   I had the soup of the day which was a gazpacho (delicious) and the lobster omelet, which was also good. My main came with steamed vegetables, and everything was a bit on the buttery side (again, so something an older person would like).   The simple decor of Jacques' is a little out of date, and especially considering almost everyone buy myself was 65+, sealed this as an elderly-friendly restaurant. BUT if you're looking for a place to take an older crowd, this is it!"}
{"text":"The food, wine and service were all superb in this quaint Yorkville French bistro.  Definitely try the omelets.  Also, the cold fish vichyssoise was divine."}
{"text":"I feel a little guilty giving this place 3.5 stars because the service and staff are so good.  They're friendly, warm and have a great sense of humour.  Unfortunately, the mains are just ok.  The French onion is good.  Not the advertised \"best in the city\" (I'd give that to Barberians, Le Select Bistro, or Le Papillion).  My friend got the omelet - which was delicious and well made.   However, any of the meat-based mains came with the same brown sauce, mushrooms, and a sprinkling of potatoes and assorted vegetables. It sometimes looked like cafeteria-style food - but obviously tasted better.  The space is warm and intimate, with a great view.  It's just that the food isn't as good as many of Toronto's other French restaurants.  However, I will say that the desserts are excellent.  I had the lemon tarte and my friend had the creme caramel."}
{"text":"I haven't really explored French cuisine before Jacques so I don't know how it compares, but I really enjoyed my experience here. I definitely recommend reservations beforehand as I came here on a Thursday night and it was packed! It's small but has a lot of character and the French staff are super friendly. I'm not a huge fan of olives but the Niçoise salad with salmon and French onion soup was great and my boyfriend very much enjoyed his veal cutlet. If it wasn't as pricey I would come here again in a heartbeat to try out other items."}
{"text":"It's a classic French restaurant in Yorkville, without the pretension in a very small and slightly dated location. It's on the second floor so look up if you're looking for this place. This place gets busy and packs up quickly with locals and tourists. The omelet was very good paired with the most perfect looking vegetables. I don't like omlets but I liked this one, probably because it was cooked properly. The French onion soup was pretty good and so was the complimentary bread.  Service was extremely friendly."}
