{"text":"They have great uni sushi in winter which is greeeaaaatttt!! I've been craving for it for a long time! Twin pieces of uni sushi is just about $9 which is quite impossible in Toronto. Uni is extremely fresh and sweet, and reminds me of the one I had in the seafood market in Japan. The service is also really nice. I also had the chirashi sushi, in which the sashimi are really fresh and yummy. I'll definitely go another time!"}
{"text":"My family have been going to Daio for a number of years.  Even now that we've moved to the US, whenever we return to Toronto, we make a stop at Daio.  The quality and taste of the food has remained and it is equally as good as we first came across it.  Daio serves truly authentic Japanese cuisine.  If you're looking for gimmicky loaded rolls, this is not the place.  What you should expect is an authentic Japanese profile with traditional dishes.  Things to order are: -Beef Udon, Nabeyaki Udon -Chicken (tori) karagee -softshell crab -handrolls (good size and very fresh) -vegetable tempura -futo maki  This is a family owned establishment with the kindest husband-wife team. During our recent visit, we noticed that there were tons of guests coming to pick up takeout orders.  We love Daio and would recommend to anyone visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"I went here on a recent trip to Toronto. I was craving Japanese food and this looked like the only decent place near my hotel. As I walked in I noticed that the hussle and bustle of the city disappeared (they have covered the windows with Shoji screens). Inside you will find table seating and private booths, they all play traditional Japanese music and the staff is dressed in traditional garb. The food is excellent but a bit pricey. The menu is quite large and should have something to please just about everyone."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. It doesn't look like much from the outside but their sashimi is delicious. Ask them what is fresh and you won't be disappointed. They only have Uni when it is in season and it's delicious!   The Chirashi and Sushi is good and their Nebanyaki Udon is perfect when it's cold outside."}
{"text":"Average food, over-priced and very very slow service, everything is average or even below except friendly waitress(only one waiter/waitress this is why painful slow service). Don't  think I will come again."}
{"text":"So, when My Son The Sashimi Lover wanted to go back to Daio two nights in a row, I figured we might be onto a good place.  That proved out for me as well--not a suchi or sashimi fan, I had delicious Teriyaki Chicken (very pedestrian choice, I know ;-) the first night.  The second night I had the very generous appetizer sizes of Chicken Yakitori and freshly house-made Gyoza--a real show-stopper.  We're very fond of our Pacific Rim connections here in Seattle, and sushi/sashimi fans here tend to be passionate about the local offerings.  I'm not saying I'd return to Toronto _just_ to return to Daio, but if when in Toronto again I'll surely return there.  My Son The Sashimi Lover says the same."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times since my first visit. I've been hesitant to try it for years because it looks fairly quiet but that was a mistake. The food here is fresh, the chef puts effort into everything he makes.   Awesome food, a bit pricier than others in the area but you get what you pay for - - slightly higher quality."}
{"text":"Pros: - server was super friendly! This may be the only redeeming factor about this place, haha - pretty clean and nice inside (despite the outside appearance)  Cons: I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews already here... - food is overpriced compared to other options nearby and for what you get; quality of the fish is not that great, as the flavour of the fish gives the impression it isn't fresh - the flavouring of the rice used for the sushi is poorly done / nonexistent; the temperature is also off (too cold) - tempura was pretty good but some parts were soggy  Won't be returning and can't recommend to others :(  If you're in the area and looking for sushi, try \"Epicure City Mt Fuji\" - better value AND quality!"}
{"text":"The sushi is made by an actual Japanese sushi chef. I ordered Sushi B (I think it was $24...), of which there are a lot of pictures posted by other wonderful Yelpers. The sushi rice is perfectly cooked and it is not sweet like the other places, it is more on the salty and savoury side. The sushi is made with much care. We also ordered the cold soba with tempura (I think it was $15). The tempura was light and crispy, and I THINK they use fresh shrimp (dead, but not frozen) for their shrimp tempura, because the texture is definitely different compared to other places. The soba noodles are the proper kind that break easily and have a bit of a slimy texture when you chew. The bonito broth it comes with is awesome too. Even their miso soup tastes like they use higher quality miso, and their salad is not sweet like other places.  Also, the service was impeccable. We had a really nice and pretty Asian lady with her hair tied up and wearing glasses. She was always smiling (not the fake kind either) and made us feel so welcome.  Interior and atmosphere is pretty good. You can hear classic Japanese instrumental music. It is clean and like many other have said, they have these really cute private booths.  Overall, very authentic food, great service, and well worth the couple extra dollars."}
{"text":"The food was really good at Daio, but what made me want to go back there was also the atmosphere and the staff. There's japanese music in the background and the waitress was always available when we needed something.  The wait was almost nothing between the time we ordered and the time we got our food.  Would highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! I am so glad my friend recommended me this place.  Venue: It looks average but clean and it has some nice private booths. To be honest, I passed by Daio on Carlton Street many times but really never gave it a second look. $$$  Food: Wow! We had many appetizers and sake. Some of the excellent dishes are Black cod, Agedashi Tofu, very very fresh tuna, salmon and Hamachi sashimi, soft shell crab,... Presentation of food was beautiful and inviting. $$$$$  Service: she was very friendly and pleasant. $$$$  Conclusion: I definitely like how good/fresh the sashimi were. Freshness is what I look for in a sushi place. There are way too many sushi joints in Toronto and some really serve plastic rubber sushi. Daio Japanese Restaurant serves amazing and serious food."}
{"text":"It's located right off Yonge St. on Carlton. The interior is not so fancy schmancy but it's easy on the eyes. Sushi seemed fresh. Everything is well executed and I think it's not one of those average Japanese restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great udon. I really enjoyed my lunch here and the semi-private booths provide an excellent space to prep for a meeting."}
{"text":"Had their sashimi lunch and the portion size was too small. Left hungry.  Service was ok though."}
{"text":"Despite living in the vicinity for many years, we never really tried out this place till recently. I think the main reason is that it looks like a regular run of the mill sushi place, and the fact that it is next to a chinese restaurant with a similar looking sign does not help with that image.   Well, one night we decided to try here out because it was like 10pm on a weekday and many places were closing, we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere inside and by the food quality. One of the few restaurants that we misjudged due to its outer appearance. We have been back quite a number of times since and have pretty much made this our regular neighborhood sushi place.  Inside japanese music is playing and there are actually about 5 semiprivate booths available, every time we have been back we have been able to score a booth. The decor inside is not typical of a run of the mill sushi place, it feels very peaceful.   The first time we were here we both had the Chirashi and it was excellent, they give you almost 2X the amount of fish as most place and the rice was well seasoned and cooked. The fish was fresh and had a nice variety ranging from salmon, clams, tuna, butterfish, tai, ebi, etc. The rice was not mushy or overly vinegary, it was nicely balanced and well cooked, grainy but not hard. The Chirashi also came with garden salad, miso soup,pickled vegetables and seaweed on the side. Very nice presentation. We were both starving and was quite full after this (note we are both pretty hearty eaters). The Chirashi was $26 which is more expensive than most places but given the quality and quantity of food provide, we think it is very reasonably priced.  I have also returned with a friend and was working in a booth discussing work for almost 3 hours and they were also very patient with me. No complaints or intrusions except with the occasional tea or water filling.   The other things that we have ordered are the Sushi B which consisted of salmon rolls along with a nice variety of nigiri sushi pieces, all very fresh, it also came with a soup and salad for $26.  The Salmon Ikura Don comes with the same sides as the Chirashi, but of course only has salmon and ikura on top of the rice, the salmon was fresh and plentiful, also great if you are craving salmon only as I was. This was only $20.  Overall, my husband and I really like this place, it has definitely been our go to spot when we want sashimi or sushi in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Quality food. Quality service.  For what it's worth, the service itself pays off tenfold. This is why I always recommend dining in if possible. Attentive and caring, the servers are genuine and authentic when it comes to providing the best service possible.  The food is always served fresh, and is of the highest quality. No complaints. Always good."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best chicken teriyaki I had in a very long time! I was advised by one of my clients to come and try this place, and knowing that he's one of my pickiest clients I knew it was going to be good! I had been to this place twice since then and every time I have something different. The first time I had sushi platter and it was really good last night I had chicken teriyaki and it was to die for! The service is really good and the owners are super friendly. The decor is very authentic and I love the traditional Japanese music playing in the background. I definitely recommend this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food took forever and came separately. Some people started eating 20 mins after others finished. Automatic 20% tip so we \"didn't have to worry about it\". Horrible experience that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth no matter how much ginger you eat."}
{"text":"Oh my taste buds. I loved the ginger tea. I wasn't too hungry so just ordered a roll with the ginger tea and they were both pretty good. Probably the best California roll I've ever had. The prices are fairly high though probably closer to $$$."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, my SO and I decided to bring his mom to Daio for an authentic Japanese dining experience.  To our surprise, they were not busy on Wednesday night we were there.  We were a bit perplexed considering they are located close to the Yonge/College area.  We were told by the server that Diao is known for their unagi (bbq eel), so we had to order it!  When we got our sushi unagi, we were blown away by the portion size but they were a bit pricey ($8 for 2 sushi pieces).  They were WORTH the price, so good and fresh.  I love the sauce.  We ended up ordering a second round.  The rest of our meal was delicious.  The spicy salmon was fresh as was the fried soft shell cake roll.  For the three of us, the bill was just under $100.  It is a bit on the pricey end but the quality is worth it.  Drop by Diao for their great unagi, one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"This place... this place is amazing. I've been here twice, on the recommendation of my boyfriend who swore he found an authentic Japanese place in the Yonge/College area. I was skeptical. I was suspicious. But holy hell, I  was pleasantly surprised.  First, the food: the freshest sashimi I've had in Toronto, delicious noodle soup, light and crispy tempura, and incredible mochi black sesame ice cream. Everyone I've brought here thoroughly enjoyed their meals and agreed that this has got to be among the best (if not the best) sushi place in the city.   As for the price- yes, it's a bit higher than your average sushi place, but that is a silly reason to give the place low stars or a negative review. If you want cheap sushi, that's your business. Considering the (stellar) quality of the ingredients, and the amount of thought clearly put into each dish, there's no reason to shame a great place for having slightly higher prices- it's worth it! Mind you, I had a beautiful salmon tataki dinner, as well as dessert, for under $30 including tip, so it's not as if the prices are astronomical or unreasonable.   The environment is beautiful and peaceful, with friendly, knowledgeable service."}
{"text":"Finally!  Fresh sashimi in the Yonge and College area!  I was having a hard time finding a Japanese restaurant that I liked in the neighborhood (other than Guu, which isn't open for lunch, Solo sushi is a bit farther away).  There are plenty of super cheap sushi options on Yonge... but you get what you pay for.  I've walked by this place many times and I wish I had discovered it sooner. It's a small restaurant with simple wood decor and comfortable seating.  They even have private booths available!  I found the restaurant cozy and instantly likeable.  It was oddly quiet for lunchtime, which is a shame!    I was greeted by a friendly hostess dressed in a Japanese outfit.  We chatted about the lunch specials and sushi.  They told me that they only served fresh fish and that I wouldn't be disappointed...And I certainly wasn't.  I ordered the Chirashi lunch ($15). It's not cheap, but it's worth it.  If you are looking for an authentic Japanese lunch in the area, this is the place!  Daio definitely exceeded my expectations and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"These are one of the few times that a restaurant deserves no stars.  We came here with a group of 6. Upon entrance, the server (lady) looked at us oddly, and randomly pointed us to a seat in the front.   As we sat down, we waited about 5 minutes patiently to see the menu. There was no one to be seen in that entire time.   Another group walked in, their greeting was MUCH different than ours. They received a smile and a greeting, and menus right away. Since they were sitting next to us the server was dropping off their menus, and only there we literally had to flag the woman down to get ours... She resentfully gave us menus. After another 5 minutes of scanning the menu, and looking at the overpriced items, STILL no one came to ask us if we wanted tea, if we were ready to order. We waited patiently for another 10 minutes. And still no one came to see us. We were fed up with the horrible service from the get go, and got up and left.  Really disappointed, and confused as to why this restaurant has 4 stars.   I highly do not recommend coming here, unless you like to be ignored and treated poorly."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are some people boost about how great this restaurant is when in fact is not. I came in and there is just anther person inside. When I take a look at the menu, I was stunned by the ridiculous price on the menu. I was too embarrassed to walk out, so I ordered chicken Katsu, but was told they run out of it. So I order a Katsu (pork) instead. It is $18. The taste is average.  Won't come here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic semi-traditional Japanese style environment with traditional music playing and a real Japanese chief. But the serving is quite expansive for it's size which is really small. But the food does taste good there. Recommend the dark beer there."}
{"text":"The service there is really gentle and polite, the slow paced peaceful vibes there are sort of compatible with Japanese culture. Taste like home, really authentic Japanese food. Definitely go to this place rather than any other overrated downtown Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Japanese restaurants, and this might just be my favorite.  My wife and I stopped in on a bit of a whim because sushi is our traditional anniversary meal, and this place is *legit*. Toronto's a super multicultural city, but most Japanese places you go to are run or staffed by other East Asians slinging Americanized fare.  Daio is Japanese owned and run, oozes atmosphere and authenticity, and the food is just *awesome*. The service was also super friendly and attentive, and I could hear our waiter knowledgeably discussing things like what fish were in season with other guests.  I knew I would have a good time based on these other reviews, but I was still absolutely blown away. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and very bland food.  The only nice thing about this place is the setting, with the little cabins. But still, I don't understand how one can make bad tuna sushis."}
{"text":"Delicious. I went to this place based on other Yelp recommendations and it did not disappoint. It's a bit on the expensive side but the ingredients are so fresh and made with such craft that it's not hard to understand why they can charge such prices.   I've never seen such care taken with sushi. The presentation is great, the waitresses are great, the atmosphere is great. I really enjoyed our sushi experience here. Would definitely go back.   I got the spicy salmon roll and eel roll, my husband had Sushi B combo. He won. Mine was great but his sushi pieces were so good I was jealous watching him eat them."}
{"text":"Parked nearby for food and saw a sushi sign, walked in. It was a small restaurant with tables and private booths. Saw the menu - everything was overpriced. I felt too bad to walk out. Order a $25.00 Bento box... most expensive bento box I've ever had. Maybe I'm too accustomed to the cheaper sushi places like Sushi on Bloor, but I just can't seem to feel good about paying $25 for a bento box!  Anyways, food came. Portion sizes were small. Food was mediocre. I'm not sure what the other reviews are referring to about the 'authentic Japanese' experience because I've been to my fair share of Japanese restaurants all around the world and I would categorize this as the lower end of the 'authentic' scale.   I came here with my SO and we each got a bento box... spending $60 on what was supposed to be a casual quick bite... and I'm still hungry!  On the plus side: decor was nice, clean, server was very friendly.  Would I come back? No.   Would I recommend this place? Sure - if you want to splurge and impress someone on a first date."}
{"text":"I was in the hunt for a new place to check out. Specially one near my hood. Since as you can imagine, as a foodie it is always great to have good restaurants nearby.   Daio seems to be going the more authentic route than say, cheap sushi houses like New Generation and Sushi on Bloor, which shows in their decour and also in their menu. With dark wood accents and Japanese paintings, areas of the restaurant --specifically the booths, feel more intimate and far less cafeteria style than most sushi restaurants.     Even their servers have a more Japanese sense of pomp and circumstance and deem to provide what most people would think a more Japanese experience. With zen-like music playing in the background, of course. ;-)   Aside a better decour, I must admit I felt as if I was not getting a good food vs money value from my lunch. Their sushi dishes tend to be on the small side... for the price, and the presentation of such does not compare to the subjective flamboyancy you would get at say Guu, Wow sushi or Tokyo Kitchen which charge only a bit more for most of their dishes.    Basically what I am saying is that it feels you are paying for the nice ambiance not for the food or vivacity like you do at the aforementioned Japanese strongholds.   I can't say it is the best sushi I ever had, however, it offers an more 'authentic' experience than most. Daio definitely deserves a second look so I will be updating my review later when I go back to check more items on their menu."}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to try this place based on this site. We were not disappointed. What a great meal! The gintara(?) or black cod is fantastic. The decor is traditional. A little bit pricey, but we did have two large Sapporo's. I will definitely be going back, recommending to friends, and highly recommend here."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto! Im spoiled by sushi in Vancouver and thought I couldn't find the same quality in T.O., until I found Daio!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I don't get why places like this got 4 stars reviews. I wanted to eat beef teriyaki really bad yesterday and passed by this restaurant. As soon as I came in no body was there and we need to wait to be seated, pls keep in mind there's only one costumer they have so there's no excuse for slow service.   I looked at the menu and noticed that this place is way wayyyyyy over priced.   I ordered beef teriyaki and agedashi tofu. It came in a very small portion. And here's when things got really bad, I ordered beef teriyaki from all over sushi place. And this is the only restaurant that charge me 30 bucks for ONLY beef teriyaki and miso soup, there's no shrimp tempura and any other tempura.  My bill was 45 plus tax and tips.  Oh and to just let you guys know, they charge 3 dollar for a glass \"small-tiny\" glass of green tea.   There's a lot of more affordable authentic sushi restaurant that is more affordable.  Note: the service was decent, but can be more attentive.  Definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"I give this place 6 more months.  I came here based on Yelp reviews.  Must've been an off day.  I got the sashimi plate for take out.  Fish was not fresh, portions were small, wasabi was pasty, and not good price for value. Also, the ratio of styrofoam and plastic to food is ridiculously high. I sat there for about 15min waiting for my order and it occurred to the waitress to bring me tea at the very end as I was paying, like she just remembered she wanted tips.  I guess I should've taken a hint from the fact that I was the only patron in there."}
{"text":"I have to say the more times I come to this place, the more I really like coming here for good Japanese food. The quality of the food is always there every time I come. The service is the same. The service level and the food quality level is immaculately maintained. The server there is nice and friendly. The Japanese food you get is like getting a home cooked Japanese meal - very homey and warm. The most recent time I came here with D and another friend for dinner I ordered one of their dinner options. The dinner options comes with a salad and a miso soup. The dinner option that I picked the bento box had a little bit of everything - it was the perfect portion size.   This is the place to go for Japanese food if you appreciate good Japanese food. It is a bit on the pricey side, but for the entire experience definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Rice was cold.  Fish was dry.  Sashimi was delicious. Ambiance was very authentic. Service was super friendly. Wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"really excellent japanese food. they try to give you an \"authentic\" experience with private booths and traditional garb. i don't know how much of that is authentic and how much is totally offensive and overdone, but i do like the privacy. the servers are very nice and attentive. you pay for all of this, though-- it's more expensive than other japanese in the area. the sushi is always fresh, though, and the ingredients high quality. they offer takeout but i don't know why you would pay this kind of premium and eat in your own living room.  also its almost always empty for some reason which is very nice."}
{"text":"a little on the pricier side, but this restaurant serves high quality sushi and food. nice and intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great authentic Japanese! Our server was very attentive and kind and the food was great. It's more expensive than most sushi places so be warned. I went for lunch and it was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"I've only seen the \"Sushi\" part of the sign everytime I went to the Carlton cinemas but finally decided to check it out after a disappointing movie this past Tuesday.  Since it was raining a friend and I decided to give this place a try and I'm not disappointed that we did. We were given one of the booths close to the windows. Also the traditional instrumental played inside is kept at a reasonably low volume so it's easy to concentrate on a conversation and your food. Both of us decided on an Udon dish each and also added an order of spicy salmon roll and chicken yakitori. Our udon bowls came out steaming hot which just perfect given how chilly and wet it was outside. I didn't go wrong choosing the claypot udon dish which had the right balance of meat and nutritious vegetables. And the soup was pretty hot that I had to keep blowing to cool everytime I had a spoonful, and the heat from the claypot made sure that it didn't become cold too quickly. The salmon roll was also delicious and the yakitori was good too. It's definitely a bit pricey like most of the other reviewers have mentioned but the Chef knows how to prepare his dishes and fact that it's operated by Japanese staff makes the atmosphere pretty authentic."}
{"text":"What we ordered for two: -2 spicy chopped scallop cones -edamame  -sunomono salad -tempura -avocado cucumber roll -spicy salmon roll -salmon sashimi  We dined on a weekday evening around 6pm. The restaurant was empty when we arrived. The restaurant felt authentic with its decor, music, and overall ambiance.   Service was great. Our waitress was friendly, checked up on us often enough and made sure our water was always topped up.  The food was really delicious and fresh. One of the best sushi restaurant I've come across in Toronto yet!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, traditional family-owned Japanese restaurant. All of the sushi is fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Lots of traditional dishes which are hard to find in Toronto (e.g. ikura don), charming bamboo wood booths and Japanese music playing in the background."}
{"text":"This wonderful family restaurant is authentic, from booths to music. Th chef has incredible style when presenting his menu. He only Serbs the best.  The very pleasant woman, who serves and probably has many tasks. Is by far the most pleasant server, and I go out on a limb, but inmost of Toronto. We enjoy Daio's style and go at least once a week. Even though their site says closed, they're open!!!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place. After I came back from Japan last year, I haven't eaten much sushi in Toronto. I was disappointed by all the places I used to go, so I took a break. The fish just wasn't fresh enough and I felt like they all seemed to work really hard to mask that by their various sauces.  Before I went to Japan, I thought all the sauces and dressings were an innovative break from tradition. After my trip, I realized that it had nothing to do with tradition. When you have really fresh high quality fish, you don't want to mask or detract from its delicate flavour and texture. It's a waste. Accompaniment should be minimal and complementary. Basically, there's really no place for sauce on a good piece of fish.    I tried this place last night. If has renewed my faith that you can get high quality fish of variety in Toronto. It's not the cheapest, but as Anthony Bourdain says, \"cheap\" and \"sushi\" don't go in the same sentence. Good fish just isn't cheap.   I had a variety of sashimi and a few appetizers. For appetizers, we had the deep fried oysters (I had to try these) and some home-made gyoza's. Both pretty good.  They had just flown in some uni (sea urchin) from boston that morning, so I had to try that. If you've ever had sea urchin that wasn't super fresh, you probably think its disgusting. To put it mildly, it tastes like ass when it isn't fresh. When it's fresh, it has a very subtle sweet flavour and a really nice texture. It was good here! The salmon was the freshest i've had in Toronto. Unfortunately, they were out of mackerel but I was really surprised they even had it on their menu. I've never seen mackerel in sashimi form outside of Japan until now. The scallop sashimi was also quite good. And the smoked white tuna was very nice.   This is a family run joint where only one of the servers isn't part of the immediate family. Service was excellent. Their daughter was our server  and she was extremely good. Explained everything on the menu and told us all about what came in when and from where.  I will be back."}
{"text":"No sure why people mentioned their sushi is fresh. I ordered three sushi a la carte and nothing I found within three items considered as fresh. The uni tasted bitter and the scallop has some sand in it.   The only item I would recommend is the rolls. They have a different ratio of sashimi and rice portion compared to the other store. This gives a different taste but it wasn't the best. However, it is cheaper than other sushi place and might be a good place for students to hang out."}
{"text":"It seems that 30 Helens agree.  Yes, Daio is excellent, more traditional than yer regular raw fishery.  Order a cooked fish and that's what you get - head and tail attached.  Fermented bean curd?  Yes, with the consistency of a fresh booger.  But YUMMERS!  An acquired taste to be sure.  I've acquired it.  \"Quiet\" is the right word, and one of the best things about this place.  Just off the busy and way-too-loud Yonge Street drag, it's an oasis.  Breathe.  Ooouuuummmmmmmmm.  Try the pickles on the side.  CRUNCHY!  I especially like the busy sidewalk tables during the summer.  There's something satisfying about eating expensive raw fish on the street.  Oyasuminasai!"}
{"text":"The outside doesn't really look like much, but the inside is very cool. It's a small little restaurant with a bunch of tables and then some private booths. I thought the booth areas were a nice touch. Although the seats were kind of uncomfortable, they were nice enough to give you pillows to sit on. The seats are pretty far away from the table/the other side, so I had to lean in a lot to talk to my date. You may want to sit on the same side of the table when you go.   The sushi was good. I thought It was a little pricey, but I'm always willing to pay a bit more for good sushi. The fish seemed pretty fresh, and the rolls were made very well. What more can you ask for?   The server was completely awesome! She was very concerned about pleasing the guests and it showed. She was so nice and always helpful. And she apologized whenever anything was even a little off. Like when she gave us different sized wine glasses, or when part of our sushi took a couple minutes more than the rest. I thought it was sweet that she was so worried about it, when I probably wouldn't have even thought about it if she hadn't mentioned anything. I know I would not have noticed the subtle difference in the glass sizes on my own.   Overall Daio is a pretty good sushi experience and I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I came with low expectations for the ramen in pork broth and I was pleasantly surprised! I had #158 with soybean paste, corn, pork and seasoned egg. It was $10.50.   I would come back!"}
{"text":"Over priced and the food is not so good you figure your paying a lot for your meal that the food would make it worth it. Not in this place."}
{"text":"Why 2 stars?  The sushi was just ok and it was pretty expensive for what they give you.  Additionally, the sushi selection is pretty weak.    I ordered my usual Spicy Tuna Roll and was surprised when the waitress said they were out but I could get the Spicy Salmon Roll instead.  Those are two totally different tastes, but ok, I ordered it anyway because I was hungry!  I had the shrimp tempura roll which was good but again, it was very small.  I guess I'm spoiled with the great sushi I've had in Atlanta and Tampa.  My service was good but I expected it to be since there were only 2 tables with customers.  Oh, I almost forgot,  the other irritating thing was when the waitress tried to upsell me when I ordered the Shrimp Tempura roll.  She suggested another that also had a California roll mixed with the shrimp tempura. No!    Try something else if you're looking for good sushi!"}
{"text":"Quite medium size place on Carlton and Yonge. The atmosphere is a calm Japanese traditionally decorated. A soft jap instrumental is played in the background which gives a smoothing relaxing effect while you are eating ... ! I had the chirashi at lunch.. For $16, it could be cheaper I guess, but the quality was decent.   They brought me my food with a fairly long day, but at least they warned me beforehand and kindly brought me a complimentary seaweed salad.  Would come back if I'm around and craving good quality jap food."}
{"text":"Came here and immediate a bad first impression when was not seated promptly. We were seated and was not acknowledge after that. No menus, no water, no tea. After many minutes of waiting, we left.  Can't believe how we were treated."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Japanese cuisine and service is great.  Grilled Saba was from Norway and was amazing. The spicy salmon roll was also pleasantly different. Slight smoky flavor with just the right amount of spice. Unagi rolls were delicious with a perfectly grilled and slightly warmed rice.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very authentic and the staff is very friendly and courteous. I ordered the lunch \"Kyoto\" and it was very good. Love the teriyaki sause as well as the tempura sause. The sushi was a bit basic but the rest of the bento box more than made up for it."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was a little lacking. It was a Saturday afternoon during the Pride parade and they had one server. A number of potential patrons walked in and walked out before being served.   I wanted to order tekka maki and was disappointed that they were out of red tuna. I got yellow tail instead and that was good.   My wife got the pork katsu, but she was disappointed that they did not have additional sauce to dip it in. I don't know if that's truly Japanese traditional way or not but I know that disappointed her.   The eel sushi rolls were very good. Overall a good place to eat near our hotel."}
{"text":"This is legitimate Japanese food. The service is excellent, the atmosphere is lovely and the food is astonishing!  I thought I had good sushi before but this stuff was fresh, perfectly flavored and worth the the price.   Had spicy tuna roll and sunomono salad, both had fresh seafood and were amazing for my taste pallet.   Definitely bringing friends and coming back!"}
{"text":"Pricey! But good. The spicy salmon portions are large and delicious. The special daio roll (salmon and bbq eel) was decent. I'd just go here for the spicy salmon."}
