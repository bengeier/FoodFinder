{"text":"We went there for a bite, we had the mixed perogies and they were gooood... we enjoyed the different flavors.  I am not giving Chopin more stars because we only had the perogies, it was early (so the place was empty).   Will love to try other Polish dish."}
{"text":"delicious daily specials, cheerful and tasty, with fresh herbs and a good healthy balance in the ingredients. friendly people. and last but not least, a great value for money. just check it out."}
{"text":"Horrible visit ! Be aware of the crook who owns this business! Went in for potato pancakes (placki) and few beers. Menu was given to us by our waitress. After an hour or so the bill provided had different prices from the menu. We were told by the owner, that prices are up during Euro Cup and we shouldn't go by the menu. Ridiculous!  If you want to charge me more for a beer, that's fine. ..just let me know ahead of time.  Don't try to pull this scam over my eyes! Here is my suggestion- clean up your restaurant  (I mean really clean it up ..dust and scrub), get a good chef that knows what Polish food it, bring me a beer that is actually cold, update your menu so I can see what I'm paying,  and go ahead ..charge me more! Until than ..you guys are overpriced! ! And the owner is a crook"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a plain setting with warm wooden tones, nice to get out of the cold. I had the beef goulash and my partner had the Polish Plate for 1. We could have both shared his meal and had some to spare. My goulash was fairly plain, but the potato dumplings were totally worth it. I ended up trying everything on my partner's plate and much preferred his dish, especially those potato pancakes!!  I was there a while ago and can't comment much on the service as being too memorable, which means it was probably good.  Overall some great polish food and very good value for the price."}
{"text":"Had everything. It's a taste of home. Pierogies were delicious. Beet soup is amazing. Caesar salad is made fresh with large pieces of bacon. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years, always happy and pleased with the quality of the food.   Tonight however was a nightmare. Not the food, but the service. Being the only two people there, we were privy to an hour long conversation between the wait staff and customer service of a phone company. The waitress was belligerent and very aggressive with the customer service representative, name calling and insults flew repeatedly.   When we complained about this, the wait staff and the owner decided our complaint was not worth listening to as they had a hard time with their phone company. Before long we were shouted out of the restaurant.   We will no longer frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Delish! Was at guest at this quaint restaurant and it was simply yummy! From the potato pancakes, petrified to the beet and slaw  salads, everything was fresh, tasted so good and to top it off the staff was beyond friendly and happy to serve.   Whenever we come to town we will make it a point to have a meal at this incredible restaurant !"}
{"text":"Great authentic Polish cuisine for a reasonable price. Especially love the fresh dill on the potato pancakes. Go for the assorted pierogies."}
{"text":"Decent place. I've had the same waitress both times. The joint definetly has character including the big TV at the back that is always playing retro movies. Food is yummy and the portions are a good size. Last time I had the Weiner Schnitzel. It came with coleslaw, beets and a big fried egg on top. The soups are also pretty decent"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. They make an authentic Eastern Europe meal. I have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"The Farmer Soup was good as were the perogies but the broth in the borscht was really thin; more like beet consomme than soup. I also found the schnitzel a little tough in the centre and the outside was not as crispy as I would have liked it. The service was friendly and quick and the portions were ample."}
{"text":"My group liked the straightforward Eastern European fare and delighted in the live piano music (which earned Chopin an extra star in my book). My sister liked the vegetarian Ukrainian borscht with mushroom dumplings, despite finding the broth a little thin. My friend's favourite dish of the night was the tripe soup, which he described as piping hot and hearty. He also happily downed several shots of magical bison grass Zubrowka. I had a plate of boiled pierogies, half of them cottage cheese and half potato-cheddar, which came with sour cream, a side of sauerkraut, and topped with sauteed onions. The pierogies tasted homemade, if somewhat doughy and bland. They nevertheless hit the spot and I'd go back for more... ESPECIALLY if the same pianist, whom we saw on a Saturday night, were performing. This guy did subdued and spectacularly baffling renditions of such hits as Kenny Rogers' \"The Gambler\" and Olivia Newton John's \"Let's Get Physical\". Highly entertaining."}
{"text":"Atmospherically, Chopin is not your typical trendy Toronto bar decked out in salvage-chic decor. Here you will find a basic dining area decorated with framed photos of the eponymous composer, the major sporting event of the day on the big TV, and posters for local Polish community events taped up around the door.   But what this place lacks in appearance appeal it makes up for in every other way! The friendly service, outstanding food and reasonable prices have made it my go-to for Polish food on Roncy. I've probably been here a hundred times over the years and it has never disappointed me.  The zurek (sour rye soup), kielbassa and potato pancakes are my favorite things to order, but everything else I've tried (from cabbage rolls to pierogies to schnitzel) is excellent. Each plate comes with three side-salads (pickled carrots, pickled beets and coleslaw), a welcome veggie palate-cleanser after all of the starches, carbs and meat :) The desserts are amazing as well.  I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Were there with the family and our friend from Ukraine. Well, the service was really good - can't say anything bad. But as to the meals...  Well, we ordered borscht because this is always a substantial soup. What they've brought us was slightly reminding me of one of my favorite soups: the beetroot was underdone, it was spicy (?), no sour cream at all... may be Polish borscht is served without sour cream but otherwise the taste is weird.   The main course wasn't anything special: sauerkraut, potatoes and schnitzel. The latter was pretty good though not outstanding.   Ziwyec beer is always good so we didn't want to experiment more.  All in all, the place is good, food is fine only if you know what to order and the service is nice.   Will I return there? Only in case other restaurants in the neighborhood (which I haven't tried yet) are closed."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to come by here and eat some Polish food. It wasn't busy and we were seated outside in the front patio. I ordered the potato pancakes, because I wasn't feeling too hungry and my partner ordered the Hunter's stew. Honestly, I've had better food at his mother's place than the pancakes I ordered. They were just too large with nothing but sour cream to balance out the dense potato. But perhaps that's got nothing to do with the restaurant itself and more to do with the dish? My partner really enjoyed the Hunter's Stew and I would like to go back to try more dishes out. There seemed to be a slight communication barrier as perhaps our server didn't fully understand English but we got everything we ordered and in a timely manner too!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic homemade Polish food. Went today and had pierogi/potato pancakes and crepes for dessert.  All were delicious and as good as my Polish mother makes.  Nice cozy decor and our server Marta was very charming.  Will come again, next time  in Toronto. It's hard to find a good Polish restaurant like this, where everything is home made. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The amount of food is large, but the schnitzel itself was not very tasty, it lacked spices. The soup was good, they offered bread and didn't say they would charge it. Expensive bread by the way, we think, 4$. I thought I've ordered the sandwich, but we got the meal, spent more money than we thoughtless intended, but we believe it was a communication problem, not on purpose."}
{"text":"I had the Polish Plate for 2 which is potatoes and cabbage served in every possible way imagined: Pickled, fried, boiled, stuffed, and sauced.  If you are hungry, it is easily a Non-Polish plate for 3.  $35."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place today since a bunch of places were closed for Easter Monday. When we first walked in, we thought it looked eclectic! The food was good, not the best polish food we've had, but definitely got the job done. The platter was quite big and each element was delicious. We really liked the pancakes and the pierogies. The mushroom dumplings in the borscht were also quite yummy."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant-- we went to Little Poland since I absolutely love polish food, but weren't able to make it until fairly late in the day (9 PM on a Sunday). All the restaurants that were technically supposed to be open were closed, but Chopin Restaurant was open. At first glance Chopin Restaurant looked like a sports bar, but were advertising authentic Polish food, so we gave it a chance and I'm overall happy that we did.   What I really wish we had gotten was the platter for 1, unfortunately this was a 2nd dinner and so I was already pretty stuffed. So I ordered a platter of mixed perogies and some borscht dumpling soup. The dumplings in the borscht soup were like tortellini stuffed with cheese and little bits of mushroom. I thought it was pretty nice, you do have to be aware that it's a pretty thin broth and does not contain very much in terms of garnishes. It was also pretty sour, which I enjoyed but could see others not liking. It was perhaps a bit sweet for my taste, but that's something you'd have to expect in a radish-based broth.   The pierogies were pretty good as well-- they came with a little lettuce leaf of cole slaw and either cottage cheese, cheddar, meat, or mushroom filling. My favorite were the cheddar and meat filling and I was pretty unimpressed with the mushroom one.   The service was really prompt at this restaurant (surprising since my experience is to expect long waits in Toronto) and the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"I came with my girlfriend on a snowy cold day. The interior is cozy and warm. A friendly lady bring us two good coffees and we had some Crêpes with cream for dessert. Everything was excellent. Next time we wanna come to have the Bigos."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour and a half for our food... and walked out as they ignored us... The food smelled good but the waitress ignored us.. everyone else was eating even after they came after us..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just went to Chopin on Roncesvalle to watch the Euros. Mid way through we ordered BBQ wings...this is how the came..almost totally raw. It took us about 3-4 wings between us to figure out yeah...these are raw as hell. We let a waitress know (thankfully after we took a picture) who swiftly brought them into the kitchen to be disposed of. She came back later to assure us they would cook new ones and \"make sure they aren't raw\". When we told her we just wanted a refund (after consuming the raw chicken) she was like well ok and never returned. After finishing our beer we flagged her down to get our bill and our original waitess came back and apologised saying \"we're obviously not going to charge you for them\"...well we're obviously not paying you for raw chicken?? I approached a guy who was behind the bar (and had been the entire time we were there) and asked if I could speak to a manager...he said \"what's up?\" so I showed him the picture I took and he was like \"look I'm just here to watch the Euros\". Look, people make mistakes, I used to be a waitress, I get it, people mess up..but there needs to be a process. If the chef where I worked seved RAW CHICKEN to customers it would be priority number 1 to ammend that. It's a huge health and safety hazard..I'm glad it wasn't kids or an elderly/vulnerable person who may not have noticed. So Chopin on Roncesvalle...if you're just going to ignore the fact you served us raw chicken at the very least put a process in place where you deal with it and it doesn't happen again. People can get really sick from this. Just not cool."}
{"text":"I would not return here. My partner received his dish and was halfway through his meal before mine arrived. He ordered schnitzel which was greasy and when I finally received mine which was supposed to be beef cutlets but instead looked and tasted like the Salisbury steak Hungryman frozen microwave dinner. On top of that they charge $3.50 for one can of Coke."}
{"text":"Tried to go here today to watch the Euro Cup. I had my bag checked at the door which I thought was odd for a neighbourhood bar in the middle of the afternoon. The guy asked me what was in my water bottle and I told him water and then he refused to allow me in because of a law that says you're not allowed to bring outside food or drink in a bar. I told him there is no such law and argued with him for a while but got no where. I've never seen or heard of this before in my life. I'm not sure why he even asked me what was in it if he wasn't going to let me in anyway. Really felt like it was just face control. A shame as I was looking forward to my day there and I had to take my business elsewhere. I won't be going there again and will be telling the same to all my friends."}
