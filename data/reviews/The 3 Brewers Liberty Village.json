{"text":"Food 4/5 Ambiance 4/5 Service 3/5  Had dinner here on Saturday night as a party of 8. They were very nice and accommodated our large group quite well, although truthfully the place wasn't very busy and it was 8pm so that may have helped. A friend and I ordered a flight of beer and what we ended up with was $40 worth of beer (10 beers!) and a flamm. We laughed about that for a bit and luckily others at our table helped out, but while we thought we had ordered one of the smaller flights where you taste a few different beers, our server apparently heard \"metre\". To her credit, she did say \"just for the two of you?\" and we replied yes, thinking it was only a few small tasters, so we should have caught on at that point. But it was all good.  We had a variety of different dishes and everyone was very satisfied. I had the goat cheese salad which was fantastic. The goat cheese comes on the side as kind of a crispy puck, which was so tasty. Would definitely recommend.  The only slight issue we had was at the end, once we had all finished our meals. Someone took away a plate or two once they were finished and the rest of the plates sat for 15-20 minutes. Then someone came by and took a few more plates, and the last few empty plates again sat for another 15-20. So in total, we sat there at our table for half an hour or more, with a few empty plates and no one checking on us. I finally had to flag the server after waiting for quite some time in order to get the bills. Other than that, everything went swimmingly and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try 3 Brasseurs since was new to Liberty Village. I ordered the traditional 3 Brasseurs Saurekraut, a side salad and a pint. I must say I was very disappointed with the sauerkraut. I took one bite and I couldn't even figure what the taste was! It was...to be honest quite gross. I wondered if anyone did a taste test before serving it to their customers. (Note: I have had authentic German/Austrian Sauerkraut while travelling in Europe).  However, in fairness the sausages were pretty good and the salad was very fresh. The server was attentive, pleasant and offered to give me something else. The bar itself has a good atmosphere. I would return for a pint and watch a hockey game but maybe not the food considering the competition in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Excelent food, awesome beers and the staff is friendly. If you would like to eat something good, in a cozy place in LV and don't want to over spend $$$$, you should go to the 3 brewers :)"}
{"text":"Beer was good, but the pub food was particularly lame. How can you fail to make edible fries, burger or nachos? Go here to drink beer with your friends and eat before or after."}
{"text":"Table seating was terrible. We were walked around up and down. Empty seats everywhere. A table with a World Cup screen. Our only ask.  Once seated our waitress was excellent- JACKIE Way to go!. So attentive. Food was good. Pretzel starter recommended.  Burger was liked and so were the Ribs. More sauce options should be made for ribs.  My party liked the sauce. Healthy choice quinoa salad with chicken was good with chicken- was slightly cold but palatable.  Overall great atmosphere. Great in the Village. Reasonable in price."}
{"text":"The space is very dark and low when compared to it's similar neighbourhood spot, Local. The service is very good. The food on the other hand is very generic and flat. They are a brewery so make sure to try their beers, all of which are very very good.  Will be back to try out the front patio (which is sort of small but cozy)."}
{"text":"The beer was solid.  The food menu is weak (standard corporate chain menu).  The music was atrocious.  The server we had was a pure delight and gave us all kinds of great suggestions for places to go while we were in town.  If you're in this neighborhood, it's worth popping in, but I wouldn't exactly go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"The food is good. We always order the poutine because it's good and it reminds me of the traditional poutine from Montreal. I order the traditional poutine whenever I miss home (Montreal). Great atmosphere, service was good and staff was nice. We go there every time when we want comfort food."}
{"text":"What can I say?  What a disappointing experience.  The beer was ok and the space is nice but, in my opinion, way too big (in all honesty, I have never seen it even half full).  What can I say about the food? I just have one word that can be of the right fit: awful!  We had a chicken and avocado sandwich and the special plate with sausages and sauerkraut.  THE CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH ($15) This is a grilled beer marinated chicken with deep fried avocado, roasted onion aioli, crisp smoked bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato on a ciabatta bun. The size of the sandwich could also be ok if it wasn't that the size and the thickness of the chicken is arguable: small and so thin that if you place it in front of your eye, you can almost see through. Luckily, the fries that came as a side, were perfectly done: crispy and not oily.  TRADITIONAL 3 BRASSEURS SAUERKRAUT ($18) This plate is made of a smoked mettwurst and Frankfurt sausages, beer braised pork belly & grilled black forest ham on a bed of beer marinated sauerkraut with potatoes.  While the sausages were just average (here in LV, we have an excellent butcher that makes fresh and hormone-free sausages for a very good price), the rest was not good at all, in particular the sauerkraut which in my opinion were very old, stale and felt like they have been sitting in a pond of old oil. It was so bad that I had to spit them all out. and trust me when I say that it takes a great effort to force me to spit out something I don't like.  I really hope this was an isolated incident because if this is what other have been experienced, then I would suggest that this location should stick only to beer and finger food.  For a restaurant service/brewpub, leave the job to someone else that in LV, doesn't lack of places to go.  In the other hand, the service was prompt and attentive and surely doesn't deserve to deal with poor quality food who would leave customers with a \"bad taste\" in their mouth, walking out the pub and take off giving less tip than they would normally give.  Will I come back? No, because in the same area, 2 mins away in any directions, there are way better places than this one."}
{"text":"When we heard that this place was open. As a beer fan, my husband wanted to check it out. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I would give it a 3.5/5.  DÃ©cor/Mood: 4/5  The place is cool very big, and you can see the brewery equipment throughout the restaurant, behind that glass walls. It's great that they brew their own beer onsite. They had a nice beer library upstairs with comfy couches. The upstairs area has it's own separate bar. The washrooms also looked call with the drum sinks and beer tap spouts.  Place looked new and modern, typical green colour of all 3 Brewers. It a cool vibe and atmosphere.     Food: 3/4  I have to say that the food here is better than the Eaton Centre Yonge location.  We ordered the Lamb Shank. Well the flavour of the stew was good. I would have preferred the meat to be more tender. I found it a bit dry. We also ordered the Traditional 3 Brausseurs Saukkraut. I enjoyed this dish more I really enjoyed the sausage they were cooked will and delicious. The pork belly was a bit on the dry side, and the ham was too salty for me. Although the ham did have a nice smoky notes to it, from the grill. I enjoyed the marinated sauerkraut, but the potatoes were way too dry. They need a sauce or maybe sour cream something to offset the dryness of the potato.  I also order the White Ale beer, which was nice. It was crisp, light and not hoppy. It went well with the meal.  We got a free sample of their seasonal beer which was way too hoppy for me.  For dessert I tried the Belgian waffle with ice-cream. It hit the spot in terms of a sweet dessert, and the vanilla ice-cream was nice and creamy. I just wish the texture of the waffle was a bit lighter. They reminded me of the waffles I've had in Japan but not as good.  Service: 4/5  Service was great! Our waitress Stephanie was very enthusiastic and friendly. Took time to get to know us a bit and was attentive throughout the meal.  If sign up for their card you get $5 off on next purchase and 4% cash back on rewards card.  Overall I enjoyed our experience, and I'm sure that we'll be here to try out some more of their beers and food. If you love beerologist like my husband you would love this place."}
{"text":"Great place.  Delicious food. Even their house salad dressing was delicious! And they have a beer sangria.  UPDATE  Had their bocconcini with melon salad. It was not worth the $14. Melon was somehow extremely sweet and didn't go well with the salad. Very disappointed.  And the beer sangria was eh."}
{"text":"Came here for some quick bites and drinks before an Argos game. While the food was good, nothing really blew me away. It's your regular bar with bar food. We got a pitcher of the Exotica Sangria, which was quite nice. We also got a nachos, the sundried tomato and goat cheese pizza and the calamari. I did enjoy their nachos -- which I find are often not done well at most bars and thus avoid. The pizza, I wanted to like but didn't. I liked how thin it was, and i love sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. However, the goat cheese was spread out in big lumps which often made one bite too salty and one bite not salty at all. I think the calamari was the best dish we got that evening. Also while the service was super friendly, it was rather fragmented. Before majority of the group arrived, one person at our table was constantly being asked what she wanted to order. But once the rest of us arrived, we would ask for more plates or glasses to cover all of us, while ordering food and drinks, and those items would be completely forgotten. We had a party of 4 and one person never got a plate throughout our entire stay. I know they were busy, and we were sharing so it didn't really matter, but some places are better at keep track of their guests than others. I think it's a great casual bar that has relatively decent price points (for the neighbourhood) and it must get really busy during game nights. I would advise that you keep that in mind if you're planning on meeting there (or anywhere in Liberty Village). Driving and then finding parking was very time consuming on a Thursday evening with an Argos game and pre-Caribana festivities!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go for Sunday brunch 2 weeks ago at approx. 11:30am, and since we had never been to 3 Brewers in LB for brunch, we decided to give it a chance since we were really impressed with the brunch menu. We were greeted right away and sat down at our table of choice. A pleasant young server then greeted us and asked us if we'd like anything to drink. We placed an order for one cesar cocktail and one coffee. At the same time, we also placed our order for food - 2 breakfast skillets. About 25 minutes had passed until we were greeted once again by our server who informed us that they were short staffed in the kitchen and that it would only be a \"few more minutes\" until our food was out. Considering we had somewhere to be at 1:00pm, we waited the \"few more minutes...\" that is until a few more minutes turned into an hour of waiting. We had waived the server down to get her attention and asked if she could provide us with an update on our order. She apologized and let us know that it wouldn't be much longer. I let her know that we had somewhere to be at 1:00pm and asked if she could check on the kitchen to see if they had started the order as if they had not, we would have to cancel the order. She came back moments later and let us know that they hadn't even started the prep. I told her we'd like the bill for our two drinks and asked to speak to a manager. The manager who greeted us was not too helpful and left us with only an apology and told us that she would take care of our two drink bill. In total, we had waited an hour and a half to only leave with empty stomachs and a simple apology. I understand what it's like to be understaffed as I've been there many times in my line of work, however it would have been helpful to learn the wait time BEORE we sat down to enjoy Sunday brunch. I have since then tried to reach out to 3B to express this concern, however I have yet to receive a response."}
{"text":"The decor is cool, they have GF and kids menus. But the food was terrible. 6 people at our table were left unhappy. The service was slow due to being understaffed. Not our servers fault. He busted his butt! But he was serving alone!!! Tubing around like crazy! Sweat dripping down his forehead! (Poor guy) The drinks were not blended or mixed well. And mine took FOREVER TO ARRIVE- and it was non alcoholic! Lol  We had to make a few complaints and send some items back. Due it being contaminated with gluten, cooked poorly, or old produce. Along with melted soup like ice cream... and so on...  The manager approached us at the end as we were leaving after we have paid... invited us back to try again and apologized- which we all felt was genuine and heartfelt. He agreed the food was not to standard. However I seriously doubt we would want to risk it again. We spend over $200 and it was a waste of hard earned money! It just wasn't good."}
{"text":"We visited the 3 Brewers tonight and had a wonderful experience.  Been at the location before but tonight was the best time at any establishment for a very long time.  The manager and staff were great and the brewer visited our table to discuss our choice of brew.  We were then invited to a tour of the brewery.    Definitely will be back. We felt like valued customers and our business was appreciated.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I was lucky to be invited to their soft opening at their Liberty Village location. The decor was similar to the one on Adelaide but layout was different even with the two floors.  It was actually bigger than I expected after seeing the restaurant from the outside.  My friend and I started off with some beer inspired cocktails. For appetizers, we shared a an order of grilled camembert.  It was actually amazing since I did not know what to expect. I would usually not order this dish as I am not a fan of cheese but it surprised me. We actually order more bread to complement the cheese as we ran out of the toasted stuff.  For the main, I order the 3 Brewers burger.  The maple sauce made it special and the patty was done right. The bun however, was nothing special. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"So...I called 1 min to arrival on a busy Saturday night...they greeted us knowingly and seated us in a cozy booth, as promised. Very busy place. Good beer; amazing service. They were running behind and delivered a complimentary Cesar salad to our table and made every effort to get us served & out the door for our concert. Food arrived earlier than promised...with a smile! Very good food...fresh and tasty Moroccan salad & hubby had the burger...also yummy!!!  Thank u, Joanne & Sam"}
{"text":"Been here 45 minites, seen the waiter once.  They are totally understaffed.  All our drinks are empty and food is nowhere to be seen.  This place sucks... Plenty of better options in the area."}
{"text":"I really should give 2 stars but 3 for the tasty beer and nice waitress.  Came here after the game to grab a light snack and some drinks... to be honest.... I wouldn't never come back for the food, we ordered nachos and they came out looking good but really underneath all the cheese it was cold and soggy as if they have been sitting there for another table and just given to us. So surprised, How do you mess up nachos ? We just sent it back, it was nice that the waitress and manager tried to rectify the issue by trying to give us a new one but we were just so turned off that we wanted nothing more from their menu."}
{"text":"Thank goodness there's another bar in the area.  Coming here for a pre-Toronto FC meal, the line-ups were long at The Local, thankfully we came to 3 Brewers which is relatively new to Liberty Village.  Inside there's plenty of seating, TV's and overall a great atmosphere to catch up with friends and watch a game.   For drinks, we ordered a pitcher of the blonde beer, delicious as always and complimented our dish. As for food, feeling for a hamburger, I ordered their Traditional burger, hand pressed and 100% beef.  Initially when the dish came out, the bun was so hard it could crack a tooth, but thankfully with their great service our waiter was able to get this resolved instantly....he too was surprised how hard the bun was lol.   My buddy on the other hand had their gourmet pizza, though forgetting which one he order, it was pretty good.   Overall this is a great place and a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tried the custom pasta that was not on their menu that day. Quite the experience. They pull up to your table and prepare the pasta in front of you. Flames and all too.   It was tasty and pricing is reasonable. I also tried their feature beer, the double IPA which was really good.   Vibe is good too. Not too noisy or quiet. I recommend it."}
{"text":"So funny to see the reviews all over the place!  I been here once and had a great experience.  We came here one evening for dinner and some drinks after a long day and decided to check it out.  The prices are very good, especially for liberty village, especially for beer.  Our server was really knowledgable and made some proper recommendations.    I had the fish and chips which was decent.  You expect the food to be like moxie's or Jack actors quality....not a King West restaurant.   Very pub like.  The desert selection all look great too.  I would for sure come back and try it out.  Based on the reviews I won't hold my breath as I probally had a really good server compared to others.  But who knows right???  First impressions are always huge"}
{"text":"3-Brewers (Trois Brassiers) just opened in Liberty Village, where the scene is already overcrowded with brew pubs wannabes (The Craft, Local, Liberty, Brazen Head etc.).  Nothing special or very different than the others.  The beers are great, both their own and the international choice.  The food is very average.  I had the skillet which was really flavourless even though made to seem like something special.  Had their sauerkraut dishes (I love Sauerkraut!) but the plate was forgetable, and the sausages included were not of high quality (one would expect for $25)."}
{"text":"The 3 Brewers is such a great addition to the Liberty Village area.  It has quickly become my weekend go-to place because there is always ample seating and the food is consistently flavourful.  I suppose it depends what you are looking for: some people may not like that the place is often pretty empty inside.  However, if you are just looking to grab a bite or are going with a larger group and don't want to wait an hour in line at the surrounding venues, I think this place is great.  I particularly like that the menu has a wide variety of foods, ranging from typical bar fare such as burgers and nachos, to lighter options such as salads and lettuce wraps.  This makes it easy to go with a group because odds are that everyone will find something. The Lilloise Flammekueche is something that I order every time I go, it's that good.  It's an extremely thin flatbread with carmelized onions, smoked bacon, sautÃ©ed mushrooms, topped with cheeses on the house Flamm sauce.  It looks big in the pictures but because of the thinness it's actually a great personal size (or a good starter to share).  My partner is partial to the Chicken & Waffles, which is presented like a fried chicken sandwich but with sweet Belgian waffles instead of a bun.  I can also speak highly of the Mussels Provencale, 3Brasseurs Burger, Beer-battered Maxi Fries, Pretzels, Tuna Carpaccio and Tuna Poke Lettuce Wraps: all very tasty and items I would definitely order again.  The beer is decent but I wish there were more options. I've always had great service here.  The waitresses have been very attentive and informative. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I'm torn with this place. The food has always been great, awesome design, incredible pricing but I find that none of their beers are any great and the service is hit or miss constantly.  It has so much potential if they could just make a couple of better tasting beers and work on the service issues. If they did those things this could easily become the best bar in Liberty but until they fix those things it is just OK."}
{"text":"Came here once for lunch and once for our staff holiday party.   LUNCH  The lunch was good, food is your average kind of upscale bar food with a twist (think Moxie's or Milestones), though there are very few vegetarian options. I had chicken and avocado sandwich which was good, the bread was soft, the avocado was covered with panko (or something crispy) and fried and the chicken was tender. The fries were not great tasting slightly overdone and line frozen fries.   EVENT  Organizing our staff social was okay. They were able to accommodate us on short notice and did their best to provide information, but responses were often delayed and their organization could use a lot of work (I ended up having to go to the restaurant to get menus and ask about where we would be sitting and speak to the manager).This may be due to the fact that it was Christmas and they had recently opened, but it definitely needs some work.  On the day of our event, everything ran super smoothly, our waitress was the epitome of the word and she was great at making sure that everyone always had drinks (while not exceeding our company drink limit), offering helpful suggestions on food and drinks as well as giving our entire party samples of their two seasonal beers. She made the night seamlessly easy.   I got the charcuterie board for his, it was a very basic one with very safe meats and cheeses (cheddar, prosciutto, salami, and brie), fig jam, crustinis and sweet pickled veggies. Nothing too special, but still nice. The apple dessert pie was strange and underwhelming it's pizza crust covered in cinnamon sugar and butter with a scoop of ice cream in the middle.   Beers were good, so I'd come back for that!"}
{"text":"Great venue, prime real estate and good beer. Meh everything else.  Food honestly, not great. Tried the nachos (which looked like a 10 year old just learned how to cook threw them together) not enough cheese and single layer (just comes across as cheap) no complaints about the French onion soup, and the salad was way too over dressed (again just sloppy.)   I had tips for the manager walking into the place. Starting with the weird entrance from the street to the Hosts: SMILE it's your JOB to make everyone feel welcomed.  It's a huge venue and when it's not busy, it feels dead. Suggestion: game days should have some sort of daily special, 'Local' and 'Williams Landing' were both PACKED by 5PM before the 8PM TFC game, I even suggested that 1 of the 4 hosts standing there, to stand outside and entice patrons in with either food samples or the daily beer special (which was non existent.)  I've been in the restaurant industry and I don't understand how they'll stay in business.. how you staff that many people and not promote yourselves in a competitive area? It's beyond me. Seems simple especially for a chain- they need to make adjustments based on the area.   Service was ok at best. For somewhere not so busy, we basically begged for our bill then, he was unable to 'split' a 6 person bill between 2 credit cards, umm why?   I just thought the overall experience was completely lacking. I'd go back for a beer, and if I was in a pinch to seat a large party, but not the food."}
{"text":"I had supper last night at 3 Brewers in Liberty Village.  They opened within the last year and it's the first time I'd stopped in.  I was hungry so ordered a burger and fries.  It was a good burger.  The bun was soft but sturdy.  The patty was tender and flavourful.  The fries were good too.  I'd get it again.  Amy was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"The environment is really nice to get a few drinks and catch up with good company, but I'm going to have to sadly say the food is so good! It's not flavourful and very mediocre. I mean from all the bar and grills out there I'd think 3 brewers would set a good standard but I guess I'm wrong.  The service was great though! Both the times I visited this location in a span of a week my servers were attentive, kind and also helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"The beer was good and the space is great, but the food is awful.  I had the most dry hamburger that I have ever tasted.  The friend I was with had the mac and cheese grilled cheese and said the noodles were really mushy and it was also quite dry.  The fries were fine but nothing special."}
{"text":"My bf and I love coming here mainly for the exceptional service and their current featured beer. :) highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ridiculously small portion sizes for the price, my stew was tiny and came with a tiny amount of fries. The service was also slow and forgetful. They forgot our drink orders the first time and didn't bring any bread that was supposed to come with the stew, when I told them it took another 15 mins to get the bread."}
{"text":"This restaurant was phenomenal. We went after the Toronto Wolfpack game and got the party room. We ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts. Servers were attentive, and managed us and our kids well. We got 10% off the meal (showed game tickets). So we left a 20% tip to our deserving waitress.. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty except for a few tables even though it opened recently. I ordered the flammande which was flavourless meat served with flavourless fries and stale bread. My boyfriend ordered the sauerkraut dish which was a huge pile of sauerkraut with low quality meat.  We both left very unsatisfied."}
