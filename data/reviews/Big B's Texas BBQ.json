{"text":"This place is a joke, first time coming here and the last. I placed my order, I go to pay and the guy at the counter over charged me, he was so confused how to use the cash register.  I end up waiting for my order which is a take out order while they serve other customers. I go to the counter, ask if my order is ready, I'm told a few more minutes, because they forgot to prepare my order. Wow never will I go there again"}
{"text":"Waited patiently for this place to open and now after trying the food, it was worth the wait.  The only negative will end up being a positive; they were out of almost everything.  This only means the food is fresh everyday and I will now have to come back and try their other meats.   I tried the tri -tip and brisket and both were very flavorful and juicy.  The sides I tried were bbq beans and cream corn.  Cream Corn was good, but, I was hoping for a bit of smokey flavor to it.   Hope this place stays around for a long while."}
{"text":"While some things I didn't like, it was more of a personal taste choice than them doing something wrong.   They use mesquite wood, not my preference but again that's my preference.    My only real complaint was the ribs are over cooked. While some people like \"fall off the bone\" ribs, if the bone pulls out clean, it means they're over cooked. They did have a good hint of rub on them. Good flavor but not over powering.   The brisket had no hint of a rub but the meat has a good flavor. That's what I look for, a meat with flavor without sauce.   The okra was fantastic and the slaw was good. A vinegar based slaw and not sweet.   The sauces threw me, being more of a vinegar base and a mustard based. The vinegar again not being my preference is done right.      The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the food they prepare and serve.   Again my detractors are personal flavor choices not them doing anything wrong or it being bad. What they do they do right. If you blast them for say the sauce, again just because you done personally like it doesn't mean it's bad or they messed it up. You just don't like it.   If it wasn't for the over cooked ribs I could have given them a 5 star as this is the only thing \"wrong\" with my meal."}
{"text":"The tri tip and brisket were great. We ordered the ribs and they were very very dry. We told them and they gave us a new order on the house but those were just as dry. It seems that they likely reheat the baby back ribs after they are cooked. Wouldn't order those again but would go back for the tri tip!"}
{"text":"You might not think Vegas is a Hotspot for authentic BBQ but once you get to Big B's you feel like you are in the middle of Texas. Plenty of options and portions for any taste but my favorite is the pulled pork!! #1 bbq spot in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Walking in, it reminded me of Rudys which is one of my favorite places back home. Aside from picnic tables and some stuff on the walls that's about where the similarities end. Staff was far from friendly. The guy taking orders didnt greet us just asked us what he wanted and grew impatient real quick. He was pretty much a jerk and thats it. The food was ok but the service and staff was far from desirable.   Good service will outshine bad food an6 day of the week, however shit service and a jerk staff will not make up for average or slightly better bbq."}
{"text":"Best BBQ on this side of the Country!! We had a two meat combo brisket and tri tip. And the Cole slaw was good too! My wife had the smoked meat loaf and baked beans and we both Straight Murdered all are food. Thanks we will be returning"}
{"text":"Glad real Texas BBQ finally came to Vegas.  Just had brisket and hot links for lunch.  Outstanding"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Food was great. Pulled pork was flavorful and moist, simply put amazing! My wife had Tri Tip and brisket.    We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sad.  I just moved here from Kansas City and grew up in Texas. Take it back! Texas should not be in the name. Sorry Big B. The person I went with said, \"This is the BBQ that Texas doesn't want\" or Kansas City for that matter. The only part that we really liked was the corn on the cob. My brisket was extremely fatty, almost inedible. His ribs still had the plastic coating on the underside. Meaning most likely came from a large distributer. I'm not to big on cheese casserole and that is what their Mac n cheese was for my other side. And my companions was the potato salad and he said it was fine. Not terribly friendly. Liked the atmosphere. But if you are going to have Texas university flags up, don't leave anyone out. Or go all out on one. I have some friends who love it and that's why went, they have even gotten the last two Thanksgivings food from them so.....judge for yourself. Yelp is about personal opinion so I am sorry it offended you Natalia. I have never gotten brisket so fatty I was unaware I had to specify I wanted more meat and less fat. Thanksgiving had nothing to do with it, I had my choice to go other places. B.B was not the only place open. I do commend you for feeding families on Thanksgiving however. There were two guys available obviously working their asses off but no one else even for a cashier.  He told us they would be right there to help us, twice but eventually he had to figure it out. As far as the plastic, it was way too thick to be casing. There is more points to be made but I don't need to justify myself and the points I reference. Your snarky attitude disguised with pleasantries of Thanksgiving will now never make me give you a second chance! Instead I edit my review for the worse."}
{"text":"Man this is a tough one.  As a displaced Texan i had to try for some real Texas bbq in vegas.  This was just about average as far as what youd find back home.  I would defenately choose Big Bs over memphis or daves.  But being that dickies is closer I think ill just keep going there for my to-go orders but for a sit down meal I'd come here.  I stopped in and got the 2 meat plate.  As far as price goes it was on par with the other bbq joints in town.  Walking in I was reminded of home.  Signs posted on the wall says they serve shiner.  If I was a beer drinker im sure I'd be happy.  Everyone was drinking shiner when I was younger.  Ordering was straightforward.  I ordered my standard or brisket and sausage.  Sides were potatoe salad and mac and cheese.  Brisket was the way i like it Trimmed.  It had good smoke flavor and you could see a smoke ring.  It was a tad dry and didn't pass bend test.  Not the best brisket ever but far from the worst. Sauage i ordered was the jalape√±o cheese hot link.  It was tasty and spicy but not so hot you didn't want to finish. I didn't really notice any cheddar in the sausage and it kind of reminded me or a store bought link. The patatoe salad was ok.  A little too much stuff in it for me but maybe you like it that way.  And a little too much pepper?  It is NOT a mustard based potatoe salad because its a Texas joint so don't be surprised. Mac and cheese... again a bit heavy on the pepper and a little runny for my liking. Now for the rest... a little odd that a Texas bbq joint missed this.  Where was my sliced onion and pickle????????????  also whats with asking if I want wheat bread???  White bread only :).  Other than that it is what it is."}
{"text":"Terrible!! The Mac and cheese chalky, the ribs greasy, and the service horrific. It was so bad, we had to go to the nearby Canes."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to some good BBQ but were less than pleased with this place. We had chicken, ribs, pulled pork, brisket and tri-tip, none of the meat was flavored and the killer was the BBQ sauce didn't have any taste. We also tried the Cole slaw, BBQ Beans, potato salad and Mac&Cheese, all also lacked flavor. We really did have high hopes for this place after a customer leaving while we were arriving went out of his way to tell us how good it was.  The service was also a little clustered and it took awhile to get our food."}
{"text":"I drove across town to check out this new BBQ spot and glad I did! It's refreshing to have a new non-franchise spot that pays attention to the details. The meat quality was great, it was juicy and tender. This place doesn't smother your order with sauce to make up for tough low-end product. You have to try the baked beans- slightly spices and enhanced with pieces of brisket. I'll be back to get my BBQ fix."}
{"text":"First time here, tri tip, brisket, Ribs all were great! Sides also Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The first indication that we would not be pleased was this is the first BBQ place I've ever been to where you walk in and we did not smell smoke!  There was no one else in the place except some of the help that were just sitting around.  The gentleman that explained the menu to us let us know that they no longer made the pork loin, they were out of the salmon and 2 of the sides.  I ordered a 3 meat platter with pulled pork, ribs ($4 upcharge) and brisket.  I was told that the only brisket they had was shredded that they just broke down. (to me that means old)  The mainstay of any Texas BBQ joint is brisket... and they had none.  We just left."}
{"text":"True BBQ art and science come together in this off the strip fave. Even when it's not your birthday you'll feel like it is upon sinking your teeth into the BEST Tri-tip this side of San Antonio. The brisket sliders will melt in your mouth. Follow it up with classic cornbread, BBQ beans and potato salad and wash it all down with a Shiner Bock on tap! As Big B himself, Brian says...\"BBQ is all about family\" and this family will share their secrets to great smoked BBQ that will leave you clamoring for more - don't fret, they also great take out and awesome catering!"}
{"text":"Brisket was bland, and very lean even though we asked for fatty.  Tri-tip was so-so, and pulled pork was ok with sauce.  The hotlink was overdone and dry (and yes, only one for the 4.50 they charge!).  My wife didn't want to finish her ribs, and when I heard her bite into a beef rib with a dry crispy sound like a pork rind, I can't blame her.  For what they are charging, it's just not acceptable.  The only positive thing I can say is the potato was decent if unusual, and definitely the best thing I ordered.  Also, the order was correct, but wasn't ready for pickup when they said it would be."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST BBQ in Vegas! The smoke ring on the tri tip is beautiful. The turkey is deliciousness. Mac & Cheese is absolute perfection. We just love this place! Anyone that trucks in their wood from Texas to Vegas deserves to say they're THE BEST!  Thanks for all your hard work, it shows!"}
{"text":"The pork ribs and brisket was a little on the dry side compared to another well known BBQ place I've been to. The corn on the cob was also dry. My wife had the hot links and fried okra and she said that they were good. Not in any rush to go again."}
{"text":"AWESOME BBQ! Their fried okra is amazing too. Everyone is friendly and the service is prompt and accurate."}
{"text":"Go to this place.  I'm from central Texas where serious top notch BBQ is everywhere, and this place is the real deal.  While I always get brisket, Mom wanted chicken and Tri-tip.  Mmm.  The smoke is serious.  In Texas we have sauce but it's not always used.  Big B's not only has traditional BBQ sauce but also a tasty mustard sauce, which I used on the chicken.  The tables are just like a centex BBQ joint, meat served on butcher paper as is the tradition.  Also, the staff were amazingly friendly and nice.  They were attentive, offered a tasting of meat to help us decide, and then remembered us, bringing our order to our table, rather than call out an order number.  I just discovered this place a few weeks ago because I was nearby; we've decided to become regulars."}
{"text":"Great new BBQ place. Feels very authentic. You go up to the counter and choose what you want like Subway. I myself got the Tri-Tip and friend go the Brisket. Both were awesome. Super tasty and soft.  You can choose a plate with 1-4 meat choices which comes with 2 sides. Or you can pick half/one pound meat and make your own meal. Staff was super friendly and made sure that we were taken care of both at the register and while eating. Even though it's a self-seating restaurant, they took the time to visit with us and to even explain the sauces they've got waiting for you on the table.  I look forward to many visits to try all the meats they have to offer. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for BBQ. I got the brisket and my dad got the ribs, and both were tender and juicy. The BBQ sauce bottle on every table really help made it out own.   Don't get me started on the Mac and cheese. It is delicious in every single way. If you're getting a side, get the Mac and cheese.  Towards the end of our meal. The waitress was kind enough to offer a peach cobbler on the house, and let me tell you, I would've gladly paid for that peach cobbler because it was so good. It had the perfect amount of peaches and sweetness in it.   Overall this BBQ restaurant is highly favored in my opinion and I'm definitely coming again soon."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town, hands down. Loved the Tri Tip, Ribs, and Mac and Cheese. The cole slaw was the best I've ever had. Washed it down with a Blue Moon on tap. Super clean restaurant, cute design, friendly staff. Can't wait to come back and try the brisket and bbq chicken. Too full to try it all this time."}
{"text":"We came To Big B's towards the end of the night and instantly felt a relaxed family & friends style of  bbq restaurant where you place your order inline & they bring it out to you at the picnic tables in seating area. The smell of smoking wood makes your mouth fall as you look at the meats behind counter! We ordered a couple of plates with the baby back ribs, brisket & pork that have been dry rubbed & slowly smoked being extremely tender & delicious without needing any sauce to flavor them up although there's both a tangy BBQ sauce & tangy mustard sauce on tables that are good & went great with the fried okra I ordered. I enjoyed the lean brisket so much I had to order a lb. of after finishing dinner to snack on later. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Living in Texas for many years one grows to appreciate truly amazing BBQ. And when moving away will spend many years trying to find anything close With most places just winging it at what BBQ should be. Well, no more searching and wishing for authentic Texas BBQ. Since the owner brought all this directly here from Texas. Everything I have tried is over the top Texas perfection. Try try try"}
{"text":"Dry tips, brisket, amazing chicken and potato salad goodness! First visit for me and my family. Awesome customer service in here...they even let us sample different meats to decide what we wanted since it was our first time! And we ended up with a little of it all! We will return!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ brisket we've ever had! And the beans and coleslaw were perfect. Definitely coming back and telling our friends about the great food and friendly staff. Just wish I could give it more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Not what it used to be. We ordered beef ribs and they are full of fats and no meat!  We still ate them but will stop recommending these to family and friends. If you change your supplier or vendor, I suggest you ge them back! asap! Before you loose many customers. What happened to the meaty beef ribs that you used to serve?!?"}
{"text":"I  thought the service was excellent, I love the atmosphere and picnic tables very nice decor, however the food was just okay brisket was very tender but not at all smokey the tri-tip was very good, and the pulled pork was not so good at all a little on the stringy side"}
{"text":"I was craving good BBQ and had tried a few places in town that were just OK. My friend recommended Big B's Texas BBQ to me and I'm so glad she did! They were able to turn what could have been a disappointing situation into a great one! I called in my order the other night and when I went in to pick it up, they were out of one of the sides I had ordered. I was fortunate enough to have the owner, Brian, walk in right around that time. He heard that they had run out of the side I had ordered for all 3 sandwiches and he apologized and offered to give me 2 other sides instead. I was pleasantly surprised when he came out with 2 containers of the additional sides AND he had also made the missing side (Mac N Cheese) FRESH for me! That is the kind of ownership pride and customer service that should be the norm, but is rare to find these days. My boyfriend was astonished when I brought out all of the food. Not only do they have amazing BBQ (the meat is crazy tender), but they also have an awesome owner. Thank you for giving us a BBQ place that we can rely on! We appreciate it! :)"}
{"text":"I have never had so much fun putting some south in my mouth! The food is unreal...best BBQ by far in LV! Big B sure knows what he is doing when it comes to smoking meat! We had the brisket, tri-tip and then some sides (Mac n cheese, fried okra, and the BBQ beans). The sides were killer! Omg the beans... I will dream of those beans...such flavor!!!  I also love that they have a good selection of good wines and beer!  Great atmosphere and great food! Do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"Yay, thanks for thinking of the non meat eaters! I loved the smoked salmon! We will definitely be back! Best BBQ place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town . Ribs are to die for. Got to give it a try service is amazing.  Will be making it a weekly place to eat."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Ordered 1/2 chicken. Got two legs. Manager offered turkey breast. It came dried out. Can't recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, the staff is aleays welcoming and courteous. Brian the owner always comes over to say hi. Its a nice private owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally a BBQ joint in my neck of the woods that rocks!  Had the following: Brisket- easily the best brisket I've had in the Vegas area. 10/10 Babyback ribs- excellent!  8/10 Mac n cheese- 9/10 Baked Beans- 10/10  The one thing I'd recommend is to have a spicy BBQ sauce on the table along with the BBQ sauce that's there.    I'm now a fan!  Returned for a second visit. Inconsistent is the key word.  Ribs were dry and brisket didn't resemble the brisket the first time around.  The benchmark for ribs has been set by Fox Smokehouse in Boulder City and by Jessie Rae's in Vegas n Henderson.  The ribs failed to meet those standards.   Was very disappointed by the inconsistency on my second visit and therefore adjusted my rating."}
{"text":"So tonight we ordered BBQ in and have been to Big B's before...again we were not disappointed. They make everything delicious.  The smoke, the beans, the flavor, unmatched!  This is the only place to go.  Brian you are the best!  Thank you for all your hard work, it truly shows!"}
{"text":"Place is good, however they were out of ribs and pulled pork. Someone was pissed about them being out of ribs and yelled at the kid taking the orders so they manager asked him to leave then came around and apologized to everyone in the restaurant. Manager is nice. He said that they are still working on knowing how much of each item to prep each morning without having a bunch of left overs at the end of the night. We had brisket, tri tip, mac n cheese and potato salad. All items were good. They also have a coke machine with over 100 flavors."}
{"text":"Hands down the best new bbq place in las vegas and hederson........\"Smoky\" Brian got it right.....i travel from summerlin to henderson to enjoy this perfect smoked food and great side dishes any time......wish they would open close to me......i never would cook again.....lol"}
{"text":"For all the healthy people this is the best place to eat!! All the meat is smoked for hours and only seasoned with a dry rub. This is not commercial BBQ this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"As recent transplants from San Antonio we've been looking for a good barbeque joint to replace our Texas favorite, Rudy's. Big B's is very comparable. We shared a #3 with tri-tip, moist brisket, turkey, potato salad, and barbeque beans. We've already made a list of what we want to try on our second visit (po'boy, ribs, fried okra, jalape√±o/cheese link). We'll be doing homestyle take-out when our out-of-state visitors arrive."}
{"text":"The best bbq here in Vegas. Everything, from the meat to the sides, it is by far the best I've ever had! The atmosphere really sets the southern vibe. Wooden picnic tables, beer labeled umbrellas, and delicious sweet tea! Highly recommend! 10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Came in and staff not friendly at all.order three meat plate with two sides,trip tip,Turkey was very dry.i had to wash it down every time I took a bite.beef brisket was good,bbq beans was terrible,mac and cheese was good.the high light of the meal was the brisket and the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Had a 3 meat meal. Tri tip, pulled pork and brisket. I chooses the moist should have chosen the lean, none the less good BBQ and good service."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, met the owner and he was very friendly. Fresh food and great bbq all around! Try it foodies! Wish they can deliver thru postmates."}
{"text":"Food was great. Brisket had amazing smoke flavor, it was tender and moist. Beef ribs and beef sausage were also great. Authentic Texas bbq. Met the owner, very personable and friendly. Ambiance was homey, comfortable and inviting. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Bbq tastes great! Try the ribs! Food prepared right in front of you as you order! Great places to sit with good music and a few tv's."}
{"text":"Wow the ribs are so good you can't get enough of them , the bbq beans are the best I have every eaten . Nice place lots of tvs to watch the owner comes by and make sure everything is ok . The device is great and yes the food is very good."}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday (only a few days into their opening) around 5:30pm. I have lived in Texas the majority of my life and I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. I have been watching and waiting for the opening day to come around every time I drive home from work on St. Rose. I have been disappointed by most BBQ places in Vegas and while some have come close to being good, none are ever great. This place was about the same. When we arrived there were only 3 people in front of us and it took forever to get everyone's food orders moving. The guy slicing the meats was slicing so slow that by the time I got to my table, my brisket was cold. I think having the meat out of the smoker/heat  and the amount of time it took to be cut (not to mention the meat coming in and out constantly) lead to that problem. Hopefully they get the hang of it (I know they are all new at this) and start moving faster so that this is not an issue. When it came time to get the sides, they were out of what seemed like everything. I could see them being out of things at 8pm but it was 5:30 and there was no cream corn, baked beans,  baked potatoes, and it was also announced that they were out of turkey while we were waiting on the sides. I personally didn't like the mac-n-cheese, it lacked flavor and the fries were a bit burnt tasting (it wasn't my first choice for a side, but everything else was gone). My brisket was a bit fattier then I like it, I wish it was trimmed a little more. I will give this place a try again in a few months, but for now I think I will give them time to figure things out."}
{"text":"Came with high hopes from Patrick Kirkbride but left with empty stomach. Brisket was fatty...real fatty...like uneible fatty. Tri-trip was fair at best and potato salad was bland. Pulled pork was good as well as the corn bread (muffin??).  Cool atmosphere but I came for the food and eehhhhhh. I guess plenty of TX folks, like Kirkbride, that'll support the business.  Update:  the person taking my order did ask if I wanted dry or wet brisket and I assumed (I know, my fault) that wet implied with sauce.  I suppose I should've asked the difference of the two."}
{"text":"As a competition smoker I know what Texas BBQ should taste like..this wasn't it.   The food was edible but not authentic as they claim.    Upon entering, one orders at the beginning of the line - the problem is that the menu sign is placed high on the wall, in the middle of the wall. It's difficult to see it and if there's more than a couple of people in front of you, you can't see it at all.  It makes ordering longer than it should.     The service staff working the line seem to be confused as what to do next.  They are loud, yelling back and forth to one another. It's unprofessional to say the least.  It's basically a cluster of confusion behind the counter.    By the time we sat down to eat, the food that meant to be hot was cold. The bread was dried out as if it had been sitting out. The brisket was dry and tough.  The pulled pork was cold and lacked smoke.  The potato salad had absolutely no taste other than salt.   We were there at 5pm on a Sat - they were out of chicken.  The busiest dining out night of the week and they are out of anything is really not a good idea.    Of all the issues we encountered, we could have overlooked, however, the owner roams the dining area asking if everything is good.  Any criticism is met with defensive comments, and a claim that they have only been open 'a couple of weeks'.   A couple of minutes, days, weeks, or months, really doesn't matter when you are charging higher than average prices for food and service is sub par.... you're either open for business or not and to serve a fair product for a fair price.  We didn't find that here - we had the feeling from the owner that it was favor that he opened a BBQ for public dining..he's full of himself.   Even in the reviews here - the owner responds with nasty defensive comments to the customer complaints.   Complaints and comments are meant to be used to improve your establishment, not to run customers to the nearest other restaurant.     There won't be a return visit to this place - I'll take my hard earned money and spend it on quality food, professional behavior and an owner that is thankful for our business.   Food is just part of the equation when eating out."}
{"text":"Thank you Jessica for making sure my delivery was directed to the correct address. I've been a fan of big B's for quite some time. Her customer service and great attitude made me write this review!!!! Also, the BBQ from big B's is the best! Always fresh and man that boy can smoke some delicious meats.  If u have a craving for some delicious Bbq, do yourself a favor and get ANYTHING now. I recommend the brisket and beef ribs, along with Any side to complete your meal. Again thank you JESSICA"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  From the moment my family and I walked in, my hunger level elevated about 3 notches from the smell of all the smoked BBQ.  The food was down right delicious.  When you go in, you have to try the turkey, it was unlike any turkey breast I have tasted before.  We got to spend some time with the owners Brian and Natalia, what a great job they have done building this restaurant.  Testament to their attention to details, Brian bring in the hickory wood from Texas to make sure his meats are smoked perfectly.   My family and I will be frequent visitors to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were soft and juicy, place very open and decor was unique. Servers very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the family meal to go and it was great!  Had the chicken and tri tip with mac and cheese and fried okra.  Chicken was excellent and tri tip even better.   I guess I'm not a fan of okra cuz I haven't found any that I like yet, but everyone else said it was good.  Mac and cheese was good.  BBQ sauces are yummy but the employees were the best!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!!! The REAL DEAL!!! Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere, they brought the outdoors in making for a fun and laid back feel. The pasta salad is light and refreshing, the beans are superb, cornbread is muffin-like, Mac n cheese is legit really really good and all the meat is perfection. Best ribs I have EVER had. Sauces on the tables are unique and delicious. Overall I left fully satisfied and bummed I live too far away to eat here weekly."}
{"text":"Our car club book a meet here and out of 60+ people that attended 60+ said that we had to go back!! Food here is amazing! The tri tip has an excellent \"smoked woody\" flavor, the brisket is tender and the hot links are spicy and the best I've ever had!! Simply put Brian is the valley's king of BBQ."}
{"text":"First time here. Big portions. I ordered family style. I had the pulled pork and smoked turkey. Tender and juicy meat. The quart of fry filled its own food tray.  We ate until we were full and now we have leftovers :) the service was very warm and positive.  This place is hidden behind Canes, looks plain on the outside on the inside it smells like hickory smoke and has a fun atmosphere. We need places like this in the seven hills area. I'll be back with my family and support this business."}
{"text":"I love BBQ, this is my first time eating here. We had the Beef ribs, baby back ribs, brisket, and tri tip. Everything was delicious. Bake beans are awesome. The owner came to our table and saw the Beef ribs we got were not up to his standard so he came and gave us 4 more Beef ribs on the house. That shows he cares about his customers."}
{"text":"Tom says best barbecue ever.  I had the chicken and brisket and He had the ribs.  The sides were excellent. Portions were good sized   Good ambience and the sauce was a standout!"}
{"text":"Came for a family outing! A guy behind the glass preparing food then starts cussing, using the F word repeatedly. He then proceeds to go to the lady at the register and raise his voice at her, you can tell she feels uncomfortable- very unprofessional. Man was wearing a blue plaid shirt, hair on his face and looks Hispanic. It made me feel uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas and wanted to have something different and have a \"low-key\" night so we ordered delivery from here to our hotel. The delivery was fast,  food was delicious, huge portions and prices were reasonable. Everything from the sides to the dessert was packed with flavor! 2 thumbs up!  We ordered: Ribs Brisket Tri tip Potato salad Mac and cheese Apple pies"}
{"text":"We ate here at 2PM.  We each had a half rack of ribs, coleslaw-me, potato salad-her and baked beans.  The ribs were nicely done--fell off the bone; the cole slaw and potato salad were fair and the baked beans were pretty good. These are dry rub ribs so there's no sauce on them at all--you can add the very vinegary one on the table but it was not to our taste. The big problem for us though was the smoke in the place--it was horrible!!  I've been in forest fires that were less smoky. My hair, skin and clothes were completely permeated and my clothes had to go to the cleaners to get the smoke out. Far too high a price to pay for a rib dinner. I would never go there again due to the smoke which they said only happens when they take the smoked meats from their ovens. Why not vent to the outside?? Crazy!"}
{"text":"A  great  place  for  BBQ.   The  owner  is  from  Texas  and  knows  something  about  BBQ,  I  wouldn't  hesitate  to  bring  friends   who  are  from  Texas  here.   I  love  the  pulled  pork  and  the  beans  which  are  hot  but  good!"}
{"text":"Only 1 visit.  In brief ... The ambience is what you might call Texas casual. Nice place to eat. I had the brisket. Looked good. Nice taste with light smoke, very lean, but it was dry. The     dryness and crumbly texture suggest it was either overcooked or heated too long. The coleslaw was mayo based, crispy and good. The BBQ beans were a disappointment. Tasted like beans in ketchup. I had the original BBQ sauce. Also, very \"ketchupey\". Very mild. They offer a spicy version and a mustard based sauce, but unfortunately, I didn't try them. The services was very friendly and prompt. The prices are reasonable.."}
{"text":"Finally Texas BBQ in Vegas. Have been searching for authentic Texas BBQ here for over 20 yrs.  This place is authentic! Wife had brisket and son and I had the ribs; both were perfection Texas style."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a bbq place after seeing the crazy line at chick fil a. As soon as we entered the restaurant, it has the Texas bbq place feel. It reminded me of Rudy's. We ordered the brisket and baby back ribs for the meats and creamed corn and beans for our sides. Smoke rings on point but the taste isn't. The meats were very bland. We had to drenched them with bbq sauce for us to eat it. The sides were pretty good. The smoked meats should be able to stand on their own, but this was not the case with the brisket and ribs we had."}
{"text":"Eehhh not the best but not the worst. I ordered the tri-tip/beef ribs and both of them lacked the signature smokey flavor that authentic Texas BBQ would have. The ribs lacked any meat and was burnt to the bone. All-in-all I would say save your money and stick to a safer choice like Lucilles!"}
{"text":"Finally real barbeque in Vegas. The owner Brian does it right. I work near the restaurant and love being able to get a good power meal to recharge. You really cannot go wrong with the meat selection and the entire place is just run right. Come for a good time if you want to watch sports and great barbeque."}
{"text":"Was ok - everything looked cooked & staged till ordering - bbq beans super tangy -  Ribs were really dry-  pulled pork was bland-"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to this Texas BBQ restaurant. I have to say I felt like I was in Texas with how great this barbecue was. The service was friendly and the food was one of the best barbecue in town. We even met the owner who cleared off our table for us. Nice friendly man.Glad we live close and we for sure will be visiting quite often. Best of luck in your new adventure of being a down home barbecue eating place.  Cheryl and Rick"}
{"text":"Boy howdy I gotta tell ya. Big B's really treated me right today. I'm just a simple blue collar working man on the road in that hot summer sun with my grandpa when all of a sudden there it was clear as day. Big b's Texas bbq. \"Well this is almost too good to be true\" I thought. So let's head on inside. The rest of that afternoon it was just me, ma, grandpa and grandma, and a big ol plate of succulent pulled pork. We tried the whole gambit: ribs, pork, cornbread and pecan pie and man...what a night. This is my go to place for barbecue by far. It's open, cool, friendly environment never fails to put a smile on my face. This summer quench that hankering the country way at Big B's"}
{"text":"The Best BBQ you will find in Las Vegas...The food, the staff, the atmosphere, the prices are absolutely amazing!!!!!!  I cannot put into words how great the brisket was, the meat melted in my mouth!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.   Took my mom there for lunch the other day and we both enjoyed our experience.  The portions were good and the meats were fantastic.  She loved the Baked Beans and Creamed Corn.  We had the 3-Meat Platter with brisket, tri- tip and smoked turkey. All were worth the money paid, very good indeed.  Nothing fancy here.  Plastic utensils and a roll of paper towels. Hard wooden benches and tables. Tipping is kind of strange because you tip before getting your food.  So if the food wasn't to your liking...anyway it was and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place elevates how to enjoy BBQ food in Nevada...sampled a lot of different meats and side dishes...hands down THE BEST in Las Vegas and Henderson...worth the travel all the way from Summerlin !!!"}
{"text":"This place is just AMAZING!!! I'm not big into BBQ, because so often it's drenched in sauce or fatty. I had the pulled pork, no fat to pick off and I put the sauce on myself. The owner Big B stopped by a few times to make sure we were doing ok. Great guy! Great atmosphere! If you haven't tried it yet, you should. I'll be a regular for sure!!! Thanks Big B!!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food with a bbq picnic atmosphere! The meats are very tender and flavorful. Plenty of food to feel full and price is reasonable. Staff is friendly and helpful. The owner cares about their business cause he walks around making sure everyone is ok, need anything and most of all SAYING HI to everyone there."}
{"text":"The BBQ was amazing! They also had a brisket Mac and Cheese that was to die for!!! Ribs are fall off the bone."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to come here for awhile now. So glad we finally got the chance to. Loved everything we had. The pulled pork and tri tip were great. Both the BBQ sauces were great too. Not disappointed."}
{"text":"We had the baby back ribs.   Half rack was a dry leftover.  Others were ok.  I have eaten at two other rib places in vegas that were much better.  Not much flavor here. Sides were average as well.  I did like the rogue ipa, but portland gets the credit for that.  Two and a half stars."}
{"text":"Natalia and Brian have done an amazing job! I have brought my family here several times even though it's all the way across town from us. You can't go wrong with Big B's!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!! I felt so at home :) This is one happy TX girl"}
{"text":"Huge portions, yummy food and super child friendly.  Got the sliders and loved it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Native to North Carolina, here on a job assignment, thought we had the best BBQ in North Carolina. This could be the best in the country. This will be the spot that I take my friends and family when they visit."}
{"text":"We had the trip tip, chicken and pork sandwich   All of the meats were very tender and tasted very good   The owner was friendly and took the time to walk by all of the tables and ask the patrons if they liked there food  We will be back"}
{"text":"Great place to have Texas style BBQ, awesome smoked meat and tasty side dishes, friendly stuff and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home from vacation and had a great dinner. The brisket had great flavor.  I will admit though, I wasn't a fan of the baked beans."}
{"text":"I've been out of commission with a bad back and was looking for something different for delivery...you know, not your usual pizza or Chinese food.  Found this and decided to give it a try.  Ordered through Yelp eat24.  I was a little concerned as Texas BBQ isn't drowned in sauce like I'm used to.  OMG, food was amazing.  It got here hot, the meat was tender and tasty (although I would have liked a touch more seasoning).  The barbeque sauce that came on the side was fabulous, sweet with a little tang.  The sides were tasty.  My house now smells like amazing BBQ.  The driver from the delivery service was pleasant and actually showed up quite a bit sooner than the expected arrival time.  My family and I will definitely be ordering from here again.  It's also close to my work, so I will be telling my coworkers about this place.  Now I know what it is I'm smelling when I walk out of work in the evening.  Yum.  BTW, this is my first review...so for me to take the time and actually write one means this is definitely good."}
{"text":"Great bbq.  Staff is great.  Owners are amazing.  Not my style of BBQ, but, it is pretty well executed."}
{"text":"Having moved here from Kansas City I feel like I have a pretty good idea as to what BBQ should be.  Walking into the restaurant was a sensory delight.  The BBQ aroma was wonderful.  I ordered some brisket, baked beans and potato salad.  The brisket had a wonderful smoke ring.  It pulled apart just as it should.  The problem I had was the brisket was: dry and flavorless.  I don't like using BBQ sauce because the flavor of the meat should stand on its own.  I ended up using their sauce-which was very tasty.  My wife had the same meal and felt her brisket was very good.  The baked beans were flavorful.  I prefer a thicker sauce but it was good nonetheless.  I would come back just not tops on my list.  P.S. please tell the very nice counter gal that I don't want to be called sugar, hun, darling or any of the other euphemisms she uses.  Doesn't sound good coming from a younger person to an older person."}
{"text":"Had the 2 meat combo with moist cut brisket and the turkey.  The sides I chose were the BBQ beans and potato salad.   Brisket was so moist and tasty, as was the turkey.  And I can't say enough about the BBQ beans!!  Service and food were impeccable!!  Best BBQ I've ever had!!  Can't wait to come back to Vegas to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Great Texas style BBQ, nice atmosphere, friendly workers! Babyback ribs AWESOME! A must try, get it Texas style."}
{"text":"Had this 3 days ago & it was bomb!  Ordered again for lunch after I told everyone how good it was at the hospital & it was disappointing. Portions were much smaller than the first time( maybe coz we ordered for a group of 10+) & they were going to charge 15% delivery fee even tho they don't really have delivery service yet & we we're just across the parking lot! Might have lost some friends over this!"}
{"text":"While there are many food choices in Vegas, but when it comes down to the BEST BBQ,Big B's Texas BBQ is hands down the best choice!!!  The food is absolutely great and the staff is super friendly and helpful!  Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ!! Great service! We loved the huge open feel with family style picnic tables! We ordered the ribs ...we are huge fan of beef ribs and are always trying to find a place that makes them well. We ordered the ribs and meant to order beef ribs specifically and may have not specified but the owner still made us up some and also came over to explain that he wasn't satisfied with the cut he got that week so he made us some extras!! Not usually a fan of pork ribs but theirs were so flavorful and falling off the bone that we would definitely order them again! Mac and cheese was awesome! The turkey was fantastic and my 6 year old daughter chowed down on it...They also gave her some free ice cream which of course made her day! We'll for sure be going back! Thanks Big B's for bringing some Texas to Henderson!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic BBQ. The smoked meat was so good on its own I felt bad putting sauce on it. This is my new favorite BBQ spot in town. The mac & cheese is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Having moved here to Las Vegas from Texas, it has been hard to find a good BBQ joint.  No, the big name chains do NOT cut it.  My roommates tried out Big B's and came home in meat comas and still drooling.  I finally went and it was worth every single review!  I don't eat beef or pork, so having two poultry choices was wonderful.  The fried okra is to die for!  My friend got the pulled pork and tri-tip..her eyes glazed over.  She said it was amazing and is rather picky on just about everything she eats.  And the best part, they have Shiner Bock on tap!!   Pardon me as I slip into my food coma."}
{"text":"Worst bbq i have ever had. No flavor. All meats were dry. Being from Texas i had high hopes for this place. I have no hope now.  Customer service was bad. Crew argued with each other the entire time we were in line which was a long time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is off the charts! It's like a picnic indoors. The staff were super friendly and helpful. The selection of meats were on par for a barbecue joint. What really sets this place apart from other locations are the homemade sauces. There were only three when I wrote this review, but those three were packed with flavor. Each sauce had it's own distinguishable flavor that made it really stand out from the rest."}
{"text":"Food was great...LOVED the ribs. Tritip and brisket were good. I'm giving this a 4 star because the bbq sauce, which is very important in a barbecue joint, and they only have 1, wasn't very good. Tasted too vinegary. Yuck"}
{"text":"First, we are from the central coast of California where \"Santa Maria style\" tri-tip barbecue was born at Jocko's in Nipomo. Until today, I thought the only place for excellent barbecued tri-tip.  We had the great pleasure to enjoy an outrageously good lunch with our daughter and her family at Big B's in Henderson! We were first greeted with a very pleasant young lady who asked if we'd ever been there before. With our indication that we were new to the establishment, she asked if we wanted to sample three of the meats they serve -- turkey, brisket and tri-tip. What? Who does that???   Anyway, each of the samples were exquisite! I stuck with ordering the tri-tip in my smugness that only the good tri-tip is prepared and served on the central coast.   Regardless of the meats we all had ordered, it melted in our mouths! Yum!  The sides were equally delicious, with more than you can eat in one sitting.  In closing, about a quarter of the way through the meal, one of the staff members came to the table with freshly prepared macaroni and cheese for those who had ordered it as a side. She said that she wasn't thoroughly happy with the quality of what was initially served, so she had prepared four piping hot servings! Who does that???  If you want excellent BBQ, exceptional customer service, big boy servings, and all at a fair price, go to Big B's Texas BBQ on St. Rose in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum yum.  True Texas BBQ!    Pulled pork, chicken and brisket are to die for.  Smokey and moist.  Love the 2 homemade BBQ sauces on the table.  Hearty sized portions.  I also like that its walk-up, casual style dining.  The whole vibe reminds me of Salt Lick BBQ outside of Austin, TX.  Prices are pretty fair too. Definitely on my short list of places to dine out."}
{"text":"Great spot to get groups together for an amazing meal. Perfect for the Super Bowl! Our favorites are the brisket, peach cobbler, and cream corn!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - this visit warranted 3.5* but since I'm forced to pick I went with 4*.   Went here for lunch after golf and I was starving. Here's what I had:  The good:  1. The tri tip-couldn't have been better. Perfectly cut, seasoned, and moist. Absolutely perfect. ORDER THE TRI TIP.   2. The cornbread-good, not great. Flavor was very good, but cold and not overwhelming.   3.  The beans-good, not great. Good flavor, but surprising complete lack of meat or burnt ends in them. Quite sweet.   The decent:  4. Mac n cheese-just underwhelming on every level. Not hot, not that creamy, and no crunchy texture anywhere.   The bad:  5. Ribs-so bland, dry, and forgettable that I find it very hard to believe I had no problem paying a $5 up-charge to get a half rack as a meat. Do not order the ribs. Do NOT order the ribs.  All in all, it's a pretty good barbecue spot. The trip tip was incredible, but the ribs were awful. For $28, there are better bbq options in the city (rolling smoke). However, if you want something slightly better than the chains we have here, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I love a good BBQ and glad I finally have a place close by my house. Walked inside about 6:00 and noticed it wasn't that busy. I was told by the employee that took my order that they just had a pretty big rush about an hour ago.  I opted for the 1 meat plate and I chose the brisket. It comes with two sides and I was recommended the baked beans. I chose that as well as the creamed corn. Both sides were excellent. The brisket was good, basically cut into small pieces and put on a round serving dish. I did have to use quite a bit of the sauce that was on the table because I felt there wasn't enough flavor. I love pulled pork so I think I'm going to try that next time I come in. There were quite a few people that came in after me. It's always a good sign when a new establishment is busy. I also liked the music they play here... Good 'ol country...but then again you can't listen to anything else while eating BBQ now, can you? I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: My apologies to Natalie B. I was reviewing the wrong restaurant, similar names."}
{"text":"I dont have any complaints about this place. With a coupon for a free pulled pork sandwich,fries and a side we paid a little more than ten bucks for both of us to eat when we used the coupon with a ten dollar meat plate. My husband got the tri tip and baked beans. I had the pulled pork sandwich, fries and pasta salad which has tomato, olives and feta in it. They give you two slices of bread too. The pork is good- I put the sauce on it that was sitting on the table. You have a choice of red or green. In a past visit we had the brisket which was also very good. Service is fast too."}
{"text":"TRI TIP!!! TRI TIP!!! TRI TIP!!!   For real, tri tip, baked beans, coleslaw, french fries, and ...if they have it...the short rib special. I love the feel of this place. Sitting down on a picnic table to eat, with huge portions, cold beer, in an air conditioned area?! What else do you really want?! I've been here about ten times so far, and I will keep coming as long as the don't change anything!"}
{"text":"Their brisket melts in your mouth. Mac 'n cheese is good.  If like hot sauce you will need to ask for it. They have only been open a few month. Beer and wine is basic. Worth trying out."}
{"text":"So....I'm being scolded for complaining about stale bread.   I feel I'm entitled to my review as my dinner and my mother's were sliders.  So yes, it was half of the dinner I ordered.  And yes, they were so stale we didn't eat them.   As to your salads - maybe cover them so they stay fresh?  But don't worry - we won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Just went here tonight (7/1/2017) right before closing and to our surprise the staff treated us as if we were the first guests through the door. Exceptional customer service and all around amazing food. We ordered the brisket po'boy and tri tip plate with mac and cheese and cornbread on the side. Definitely the best BBQ in Vegas that we've experienced thus far. Hats off to the owner and staff, can't wait to go back. Will definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Second time to visit and the high quality food held up.  First visit I tried the smoked turkey, good smoke flavor and moist.  I also had to try the brisket, was impressed that they asked if I wanted lean or fatty brisket.  I chose the fatty brisket as it would hopefully have more flavor.  Was not disappointed, just the right amount of marveling, great mesquite smoke flavor and a hearty bark on the edges.  This second trip I had to try the brisket again to check for consistency, and I really enjoyed again.  Had a couple slices of the tri-tip and that too was good.  My only let down so far was the beef rib.  Flavor was good, but they were borderline chewy and were mostly bone ... these were not the heavy duty beef ribs that you get in the hill country of Texas... Or the beef ribs that Rollin Smoke is serving up here in Vegas.  I'll have go back and try the baby back ribs next time.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get some great BBQ for a pretty affordable price!  And if you have a young one you can bet the owner will bring them over some ice cream!!!  Glad this place is so close to our house."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned reading recent reviews that weren't all the flattering.  But I had ordered first from Bite Squad, then read the reviews.  I thought it was pretty darn good.  I had the  2 meat platter.  brisket and smoked turkey.  Both were gooood.  Moist and tender for both.  I had the corn bread.  yeah not exactly sure if it's nutmeg or cinnamon in them, but they tasted more like pumpkin muffins. it wasn't bad, just different.  The mac and cheese that I got for the second side was ok  not as creamy as I like - but it might be that it had cooled down on the delivery.  I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We moved to Henderson from Fort Worth, TX and tried a lot of the BBQ places in town.  Didn't care for any of them. Then, we tried Big B's...love it!  Me and the family go at least once a week to get our \"fix.\"   All the sides are great, too."}
{"text":"Finally!  Authentic Texas BBQ is available in Henderson, \"Big B's Texas BBQ.\"   The space is pleasantly arranged with picnic tables and simple, functional decor. The pleasing aroma of slow-smoked meat fills the air.   I was greeted with smiles and helpful attitudes each time I've visited. My three experiences have each been 100% satisfying.   The Pulled Pork, Brisket, Tri-tip and Baby Back Ribs are genuine and delicious. The side-dishes I have enjoyed thus far are filled with pleasing flavor.    The care, passion and time invested in each dish are apparent at first bite. The staff demonstrates that same care.   I have recommended, and will continue recommending Big B's to family, friends and coworkers.   Food this good deserves to be shared with everyone you know.   5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Great service, the best BBQ ever. Love the moist brisket and Mac and cheese, baked beans very good too."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come here asap. The smoked turkey is AMAZING! The mac and cheese, chicken, tri-tip, beans, and fries were all very good as well. For me, as I dont eat red meat, the real winner is the turkey. The house bbq sauce is a bit on the sweet side but a definite hit. The owner was out walking table to table meeting everyone, cleaning up, and handing out samples which was very nice. Will for sure be back again and again. Love a good, family run bbq place and this tops them all."}
{"text":"Today I had the chicken Tri-tip and pulled pork and for sides baked beans and okra good stuff. Great service good BBQ joint"}
{"text":"Save your money and go next door to canes. Spent $62 to feed my wife and small child. We ordered the cold brisket, the  1/2 rack of dry ribs, and the soggy corn on the cob with the silver dollar sized cornbread that was also cold. Not sure where all these high ratings are coming from but we were both pretty disappointed. We've eaten some of the best BBQ in south Texas and was kind of hoping to find a place in Vegas that's comparable, guess we'll keep looking. Wouldn't go back if the price was cut in half."}
{"text":"Food was mad fire. Literally everything was perfect didn't have one complaint at all. 10/10 would go again"}
{"text":"Best BBQ i've tasted! The service is fast and the waitresses are friendly. The ribs here are moist and it melts in your mouth! The sides of mac n cheese, potato salad, and fries compliments the BBQ. You're for sure to be taken care of, and you will leave the restaurant with your tummy and yourself happy!"}
{"text":"They have smoked meatloaf!!!!  Omg it's good!  Look no further for some good beef ribs   prices are right and the service is great.  Lots of space and since selection of beer and sides.  Hey where is the Lone Star?!?;"}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about. Food is good but I will go back to Road Kill Grill  or H&H next time. The hot link was good, the chicken had good flavor but was difficult to eat with skin like leather, and not too much flavor with the brisket. The beans were good along with the mac n cheese, and potatoe salad  was lacking. Nothing we will go back for"}
{"text":"I will definitely be coming back to Big B's! Great BBQ. Probably the best Tri-tip I have ever had. The Mac and cheese is great as well."}
{"text":"This place is truly unique. The service is great and the staff is very friendly.  The food is out of this world and can't wait to go back. In fact I am going tonight."}
{"text":"Super clean, beautiful brand new renovations and friendly, proud owners. Service was outstanding, everyone behind the counter and throughout the dining was friendly. Food was on par with excellent service. We will definitely be back to dine or pick up when we are too lazy to smoke our own chicken, pork or tritip. Price was good for the amount of food, no complaints, just compliments!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that I moved my family here from San Antonio Texas & I haven't had any decent bbq since iv been in Las Vegas. So I'm googling bbq places for my wife's birthday & I come across Big B's Texas BBQ & I think this is probably some fake imitation Texas bbq restaurant but I say what the hell let's try it at a risk since it's my significant others birthday. So we drive out there & I say to myself this place don't look much like a Texas bbq place so I go inside & to my amazement a man around 7 foot tall greets us at the door. This giant Texan gave us the warmest welcome that iv ever received since leaving Texas & proceeded to give us the tour & treat us like family. I noticed a familiar smell as I walked by shelves full of Texas mesquite wood the owner himself drives down to Las Vegas from Somerset Texas. Upon further inspection I realized that I was surrounded by everything I loved about Texas & the atmosphere made me feel so at home that I wanted to cry. But now came the best part ,the food. I thought I'd died & went to bbq heaven, the most mouth watering smoked meats that iv ever had & a huge helping of delicious sides. So that was my wife's Birthday & she loved it. Last night was my birthday & nothing else came to mind but Big B's Texas BBQ, this time my family was greeted by a woman that knew exactly what southern hospitality was all about, she made my birthday better than I could have ever expected. The food was fast, hot, & better than ever. When they say things are bigger in Texas they ain't playin around. I was surrounded by a feast of my favorite Texas foods. I had Dinosaur size beef ribs, brisket that was so Tender that I could not even pick it up without it falling apart, a pile of hot French fries, a bucket of steamy Mack & cheese, fresh cornbread, some real sweet tea & a large variety of delicious sauces. But there was something else about this food that I forgot about which  is the love & time that goes into home made food like this. I loved my experience at Big B's Texas BBQ & it's my new home away from home. My only regret is that I left without tasting their home made pecan pie! This place did make my wife cry last night as my Daughter is deployed in the Navy out in Bahrain & this place reminded her of our little girl so much that she couldn't hold back. My Daughter loved this place when we came for my wife's birthday! Thank you guys for being so kind & passionate about bringing Texas food here to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. They had been open for just 4 weeks. Large dining room with cool tables, including wire reel tables and seats. The food was good, not the best I've ever had, but good. Didn't have beer since I was working, but they do have beer and wine. I'll be back both during work and after. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Completely unhappy. Expensive  and waste of money. No sauce. Can't believe this lace is in business. Good look at Tony Roman or village pub. They have ribs done right."}
{"text":"Is there more than 5 stars! I have eaten BBQ in Texas and I thought I would never find anything that rivaled what I had in Texas here in Vegas. I was wrong! The owner explained that he gets his wood for smoking straight from Texas! The food here is amazing and the decor is awesome! This is my new favorite BBQ place. Try the brisket and their hot links are great. the sides are the best anywhere and they serve alcohol. Prices are pretty reasonable for a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Pros: Great bbq, family run, good staff  Cons: Um, not the place for vegans? Lol  Details: This is my go-to place for bbq in Vegas. It is Texas style though they have a few different sauces. I like to mix the house bbq with the super hot. I personally like the tri tip and brisket. I always grab a hot link too. The sides are pretty good but the meat is what shines. They also serve beer and wine. I have not gotten catering but they offer it and you get pretty good deals on large orders. They have combo plates too and you can get multiple meats. However, I'd recommend going in a group and getting a lot of variety and then trying everything. You can tell they care a lot about their product."}
{"text":"Yum!!   Summary: Portions are large, meat was extremely good (I had the ribs), many side options, CLEAN place - they've got my vote!   Everyone was so friendly - customer service is definitely a priority here. The guy at the front of the line that took my order was helpful in walking me through their process and wasn't condescending, making good recommendations and suggesting popular items when I was undecided. We were asked by multiple employees passing by how our meal was and one extremely large but kind looking man - who I can only assume is \"Big B\" - was one of them. It's always nice when you know and feel that you're in a family-run place!  I really like the layout of the place, making you feel like you're at a family picnic or BBQ with wooden picnic tables and the classic roll-of-paper-towels-on-your-table move. :P  We came later, around 8 P.M. (they close at 9 P.M. on the weekdays) and were offered peach cobbler toward the end of our visit because they don't like to serve it past the day it was made. That was a nice surprise! Also makes me want to get it every. single. time."}
{"text":"Ordered out for the first time on Father's Day. We got the tri tip, ribs, pulled pork & sausage- for the sides we got Mac & cheese and creamed corn. This was some of the best BBQ I've had in Vegas! The BBQ sauce was also delicious! My favorite meat was the ribs and tri tip & both of the sides were delish! Can't wait to go back!!:)"}
{"text":"We went here to check out the Route 91 memorial. My husband was a survivor and it's one of the only memorials he wanted to see.  We ate here and it was amazing. The staff was so friendly even with my crazy kids running around. The brisket was mouth watering. Thanks Big B's for supporting Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sign said $15 for two meats,  I ordered tri-tip and baby back ribs when I get to the register that was a $5 upcharge for adding ribs. Got coleslaw and baked beans the baked beans came out boiling Hot,  so hot burned my mouth."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST BBQ in town! The food had so much flavor! I had the brisket and hot links and my husband had the smoked turkey. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great; sweet tea, fried okra, potato salad was GREAT.   BBQ sauce and BBQ sauce options are lacking...   Corn and fries are not recommended.   We had ribs and tri tip and while they weren't horrible - we kinda wished we went with the brisket and something else.   We'll likely be back, but we probably won't go out of our way to get here."}
{"text":"Loved it! I could taste the smoke in the meats and very tender. My favorite meats were the tri-tip and ribs and fav side was the fried okra. The portion size is large so two 3 meat combos feed my family of four for lunch with leftovers to take home. The wait for the food was short and the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"As a legit BBQ fan, I am a big fan of this place. It's a great local joint with lots of options reasonably priced...and they have fried okra which was the determining factor for my trying it in the first place. The meat is juicy and flavorful and the sauce is delicious. The hot links are fantastic and spicy and they have a great mustard sauce available. 10-12 beers available in bottle/draft and more than 6 wine choices. Real Good!"}
{"text":"This is exactly like what you see in Texas! They were awesome and let me sample the Brisket and Tri-Tip! I went with the 2 meat with Brisket (Great!) and Jalape√±o Sausage (Ok - go with the tri-tip next time) and Mac n Cheese (Great! Very cheesy), Beans (Great! Spicy with meat inside) and Potato Salad (Good, not a fan of peppers, but they were big enough to pick out) for sides. They also gave me a nice sample of the Pull Pork (Awesome) Everything was hot juicy and awesome!!  I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The best bbq in Vegas. Decent price and great quality food. Love them moist brisket. You get the same amount of food as Lucille's and famous Dave's for half the price. The smell in here is sooo awesome."}
{"text":"Being a temporary transplant from Texas, I am constantly on the look out for some good home flavors.  We actually had the opportunity to taste some Big B's Texas BBQ at a Hurricane Harvey Fundraiser at Casa Shenandoah.  We enjoyed it then and kept meaning to go to their restaurant in Henderson.  Last Friday, our opportunity arose.  The entire experience felt like home...from the Shiner Bock to the BBQ and sauce.  The brisket was done to perfection with a smokey ring.  It was melt in your mouth good and definitely not dry.  No sauce necessary!  I also had the hot links which were delicious.  My boyfriend had the chicken and brisket and said both were great.    To be honest, the only thing missing was the slice of bread or bun, sliced onions and sliced pickles that you ALWAYS get with Texas BBQ at home.    We will be back!  Thanks Y'all!"}
{"text":"By far the worst barbecue I've ever had! Dickeys has them beat by far--as does Lucilles and I don't even like Lucilles. I had high hopes for the place as all the local food bloggers had posted great pictures of the food. The woman helping us order answered all our questions well and was very nice and courteous. Everything from there was a steep downhill ride. After we had paid and sat down, we waited a great deal of time for food that was already prepared. The woman bringing the food out warned us not to eat the chicken skin as it would not be good?? I've NEVER had barbecue chicken where the skin is inedible--nor have I had a server tell me it was going to be! In disbelief, I tried it anyway and was shocked that she was right. It was tough like leather. It was no joke, the chicken was actually inedible which was a shame as half of the flavor in bbq chicken is the skin! Actually, that's probably a misstatement as 100% of the flavor was probably in the skin in this case as the chicken WAS NOT SALTED AT ALL. Shocked I dug into my baby back ribs--by far my favorite bbq meat. It wasn't salted either! Nor was it seasoned or spiced at all! The only flavor was a bit of underwhelming smokiness. It was tender, but dry but not quite fall off the bone. The only saving grace was the creamed corn, and that was more like cream of corn soup! The potato salad, like the rest of the soup was not seasoned aside from a dash of pepper. Again, no salt. The macaroni and cheese was mush--and surprise surprise, also had no salt aside from whatever cheese they had put into it. Extremely hopeful that the sauce would add some kind of redeeming quality to the meat I found it was watery and just as bland as everything else that had come out. The highlight of the meal was unfortunately the sliced bread and even that was dry."}
{"text":"We tried this BBQ place tonight & was not disappointed!  There were 3 of us and we ordered the pulled pork sliders, the po boy with brisket & the ribs. All 3 were so good!  Between the 3 of us we got Mac n cheese, corn bread & French fries which were so good too!  I could've eaten that Mac n cheese until I was miserably full!  All of the employees we came in contact with were so nice & welcoming. Can't wait to eat the left overs & go back."}
{"text":"Very delicious and amazing! Loved that I was able to find a great tasting BBQ place! Being from Texas, I lost hope when I moved out here. Just glad to find a place that hits home to me. Tri tip and brisket were delicious, the fries and Mac and cheese were absolutely amazing. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Friend insisted we come here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, figured why not since I love BBQ and grew up a bit in Texas. There was only one couple in line when we went in so there was no wait, looked at the menu and decided to try the two meat combo with tri tip and jalapeno cheddar sausage along with mac and cheese and the fries.   The sausage was very dry and chewy and I couldn't finish it, the tri tip was lackluster in flavor and had to add sauce to eat. The mac and cheese was good and had good flavor, the fries on the hand where not great and also had a few of them and decided not to eat them.   Overall I might consider this place again, but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"Zee best BBQ I've had in forever. My whole family was very happy with the food and service. Can't wait to go back have some more brisket and apple pie."}
{"text":"Ordered catering from here.   Amazing brisket.  Melts in your mouth with great smokey flavor.   The ribs and pulled like are also amazing. Just like in Texas.   Beans have huge chunks of meat in them with it ended flavor.     Pricing is good and can feed the whole family for lunch and dinner 2x!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best BBQ spots I've been to in a while. The service is great and the ambiance of the restaurant with its picnic-style tables is outstanding. Everything is juicy and perfectly cooked, but my personal favorites were the brisket & tri-tip AND those BBQ Beans are out-of-this-world!! I would definitely recommend and will gladly return."}
{"text":"Got the 1/2 lb wet brisket it was OK. Maybe next time going to try the tri tip or lean brisket. Mac and cheese pretty good. Potato salad not the greatest I've had.  Maybe I'm being a little bias just had great BBQ 2 days prior down the road. Maybe they where on point that day and here had a little hick-up today . All in all I will be back to give another try. Really like the decor for sure A+"}
{"text":"Great place, staff is always friendly, and the place is always clean. The food is really here, the price is a little high when you first look at it but when you get your food it's well worth the money. I've been here 3 or 4 times and I bring my friends with everytime when we have our military drill weekend. I would recommend the 2 meat if you're really hungry if you are looking for something to just eat get the 1 meat you'll definitely have more than enough. The sides are really good as well, their cornbread and bake beans are the best in my opinion. Overall great place and very good food. A bit pricey but like just said the food you get makes up for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service and food was amazing!!!! I love it and will recommend it if you enjoy good old American BBQ!"}
{"text":"This place is DELISH! My favorite is the hot links with fried okra & mac 'n cheese. Shiner Bock on draft & lots of picnic style seating."}
{"text":"Best Brisket in Las Vegas!! (And it's not even close).  For the past several years, there seems to be a plethora of BBQ restaurants poppin' up in the Valley. And each one claims to have a different regional style when it comes to their BBQ, and many places carry similar items, but done with their own personal taste. While there are places doing good ribs (Rollin' Smoke) or good pork (Jessie Rae's), there is not one single place in town doing good brisket. Except today, when I went into Big B's Texas BBQ.  I saw this new business when Heather N. checked into here. Always on the lookout for good BBQ, and I noticed it was close to where I was at the time, I noticed it was around lunch, so I had to get my grub on.  It's located behind the Raising Cane's on St. Rose Pkwy, there is a lot of parking so don't worry about it. After walking in, I knew I was in the right place. Even though there is a little bit more finishing up when it comes to the interior, it does scream Texas style BBQ. Sort of like that BBQ place that was on the King of the Hill cartoon (Sugarfoot's?). Anyways, after ordering some meats, paid my bill, then sat down.  Brisket - Man.. that is some brisket. Not only the best brisket in Vegas, but one of the best ones I've ever had in my life. I'm sure a Texas BBQ connoisseur would probably be more qualified to talk about the subject, but I really like a very tender brisket, and that is what is missing from all the other spots in town. There is an actual 'smoke ring' that you can see on it. It wasn't plain or dry. It was truly a spectacle to behold.  Tri-tip - I had a old friend who attended UT at Austin back in the day, and I asked him if tri-tip was as popular as brisket. He said he really didn't see it that much. I did some research and found out that it was more of a California thing. But the way that Big B's does tri-tip, Texas should think about adopting the tri-tip as part of their BBQ style, because the one at Big B's is phenomenal. Absolutely tender, and it just melted, and that smoke ring doe.... I was just floored.  The sauces were great as well. I personally don't like a BBQ that's so sugary sweet, I liked that Big B's was more about spice, and subtle amounts of sweetness, and complexity of flavor. There are two of them, a red and orange colored one, and I liked swirling both of them, and playing with them on top of my brisket and tri-tip.  Texan's know their beef and Big B's knows how to cook it correctly. If you're tired of dry, flavorless brisket in Vegas, I would definitely recommend this spot. I would also like to see some reviews by some Texan transplants to see if I'm right, or just crazy. Probably just crazy."}
{"text":"Mmmm...love Big B's!!  Had the Texas cheesesteak with tri-tip...best sandwich I've had in a while.  Smoky meat, gooey cheese.   Also had fries, cole slaw, and beans.  Fries are hand cut and really good with their bbq sauce.  Beans were great also with lots of pieces of meat mixed in.  Only disappointment was the cole slaw which was okay but not my fave.  Service was fantastic!!  Definitely returning soon!  Wanted to try dessert as they had some tasty looking pies but too full...next time"}
{"text":"Pablo was amazing! Great service!! And the turkey!! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE !!! God this place was amazing!! Thank you!!! The"}
{"text":"This place could be a 5 star rating but needs to fix a few things... The main one being that the current menu on their website says that a 3 meat plate is $15.99. It's not. It's $2 more at $17.99. Big Difference! Come on people! Three of us went to try it out last night, first time for all of us. It was good. Between us we had (and I tried everything): tri tip - it was moist, good and I would get it anytime. The brisket - moist, good, fatty piece on top that I'd expect. Smoked turkey - VERY good. I'd get this every time. Cheddar and jalapeno sausage - good, but VERY spicy. I eat jalapeno poppers etc, but this was much hotter, so be warned. We also had creamed corn, mac n cheese, and fried okra. All very good. The least fave was the creamed corn. It seemed that it was too thick, we were there about 6:30pm so maybe it had sat there too long on a warmer, not sure. But way too thick. I thought the plates should have come with bread, but we didn't get any bread with ours, and were never offered bread. I thought from other reviews we would get a slice of bread, and since we paid $2 more than the menu price I would have thought we would get a slice of bread but oh well. The other small problems: 2 of us wanted a glass of draft beer. The lady said that for a dollar more we could get a pitcher and it would be about 5 beers. So we got the pitcher and it was exactly 3 cups of beer. So she was either told WAY wrong or they are trying to upsell by lying. Not sure. But I guess it is still a deal. But for just one more beer I wouldn't have got it. Also the sauces... They have a sweet sauce that has basically no hot spice, and a honey mustard. I like a little more kick though. I asked the gal that brought our food if they have something a little more spicy and she went and got a chipotle sauce. Ok this was like fire in your mouth. They need a regular spicy bbq sauce. I sure hope the owner reads this and fixes his website and the small things listed here to make it a better place."}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest and we have great BBQ there. This place is one of the best I've had in a long time! Great location and great food! Their pulled pork and chicken we took home. The BBQ ribs were fantastic! One of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"I have throughly enjoyed Big B's BBQ any time I have ordered. Food is hot, fresh and very flavorable. I have always been pleased with delivery and great tasting food! Looking to satisfy your BBQ needs, try Big B's!"}
{"text":"Was going to eat dinner at the Texas BBQ last night and as I stood in line notice multiple customers with their dogs eating in the restaurant and standing in line with me with their dogs. I could see dog hair floating in food. I found this disgusting and turn around and left, I guess this is a good place if you are a dog lover and don't mind dog hair in your BBQ. Updating my review these were not service dogs, the man in line in front of me looked like a weight lifter and the dog was a pit bull.."}
{"text":"The BEST Texas BBQ in all of Nevada! The best brisket ever! It was so tender no knife needed, it falls apart with a fork! We all had something different... pulled pork, brisket and tri-tip and all 3 were fantastic. And they give you 2 yummy corn bread muffins! And the fries are fresh and delicious. No skimpy portions here... I've found my new home for BBQ. The owner came over and was so nice. This is definitely family owned!"}
{"text":"I needed a great place for my granddaughter's Coronado Prep pre-school teacher's appreciation lunch so I thought of my favorite local place, Big B's. So I spoke with Brian, the owner, and he was so patient. I went in and he designed the perfect menu. Pick up was flawless and the teachers were so thrilled by how yummy everything was. It is very important to support our local businesses. Brian and his staff are just superb!!! In my opinion, the smoked turkey and tri tip are the best! Thank you Brian."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying - I REALLY wanted to like this place. I would drive by the restaurant on St. Rose on my way home in anticipation for the opening day every since I read the sign saying \"Texas BBQ\", but I digress. And I was reading through the reviews and saw at least 2 employees post raving reviews - complete deception.   This was by far the WORST BBQ I have ever had. When you brand yourself as \"Texas BBQ\" you have better be able to fill your \"britches\" and bring your A-game.   I had the baby back ribs - they tasted old, gamy, and had thar nasty old pork taste and lacked any flavor whatsoever. When pork is fresh and cooked right, it should taste moist, buttery, and just taste delicious. This was not the case. I ate one rib and it was one rib too much.   My other half had the brisket - it was tough, Chewy, dry and had ZERO flavor.   The Mac and cheese tasted like nothing other than extreme smoke. Tasted burned and flavorless. Tasted nothing but smoke.   The baked beans were overly sweet and had a strong pungent flavor of a concoction I had never tasted before. Canned baked beans were better than this.   The owner or manager circled the floor as I stated to my other half, \"I have never had ribs this bad before.\" I know he heard me because He stated, \"if there's something you don't like, I will be happy to bring you something else.   I felt so bad and was far too embarrassed to be a jerk and confront him when clearly he felt so proud of their new business. I nodded and he continued on to the next table.   The atmosphere was far too quiet, the tables were far too big and spread apart. There was no energy. It was dark and lacked that upbeat atmosphere you expect from a BBQ restaurant.   When we first arrived, people would come in and see the food and would walk right out. 7 peolple ahead of us left shortly after we arrived. That should've been our cue to take our leave as well. The food was placed in an assembly line - cafeteria style. You could tell that the food had been sitting there a while on the food warmers. But still, I wanted to give it a chance despite my other half wanting us to leave.   We had a few bites of each of our plates and decided to get a to go box to take to feed a homeless person who was in dire need of food. I felt horrible throwing food away, do I didn't.   The only thing that was good was my blue moon I had before we ran out of the place.   I love BBQ especially with my spouse being from Texas. I wish I had a raving review but for the first time, I have to give the lowest review possible.  If you are a BBQ enthusiast, please beware before wasting your money. This place isn't that cheap and the food was an utter disappointment. :-(  The staff was friendly, but that was the extent to the good about this place.   We settled for raising canes in the same parking lot after wasting a Friday evening out on a horrible experience.  I really do hope they remedy this quickly because it does look like they did put a lot of into it."}
{"text":"So we have our favorite barbecue places around town but we are always  on the hunt to try all the different kinds of BBQ out there.  This unfortunately was not my favorite  kind of barbecue. It's not terrible but not what I could consider coming back for.   I tried their specialty sandwich which had pulled pork, brisket and  a hotlink topped with some coleslaw sandwiched between a tasted bun. I overheard them say they only season with salt and pepper and some people are into that I personally like a little bit more seasoning and I actually ended up adding more salt. The table barbecue sauce was just okay but their mustard sauce helped, but just after a few bites I was pretty much done.  Our sides consisted of fried okra, creamed corn, potato salad, and macaroni and cheese. The creamed corn tasted straight out of the can the fried okra didn't have much taste but the mac and cheese was pretty good.  The place is nice very large with wooden picnic benches and apparently they bring their firewood all the way from Texas. Texas is known for a lot of things barbecue tops the list so I'll be on the hunt once again in search for some Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"We are regulars, the meat has been great every time we have ordered from there and so have the sides, one suggestion i have is to the fries fried twice, they need to be crispier. Other than that its all good."}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times and finally decided to check it out. It's kind of in an obscure location behind Canes and Tommy burger off of St. Rose Pkwy by Eastern. When we first walked in, we immediately liked the set up: Open spacious with picnic tables. We had a coupon for a family meal and it included: 1 pound of pulled pork, 4 quarter leg chicken, 2 Quart of Sides and 6 piece of bread. For the four of us, I thought it might not be enough but I was dead wrong. There was so much food that I had enough for leftovers. I love the casual picnic benches and all the televisions. I bet this place is packed during NFL or NBA seasons. Anyways the food was AMAZING! the chicken melted off the bone with a smoky taste, the pulled pork was moist and the cream corn/potato salad was out of sight. I loved it so much we came back the next week to try the beef brisket and I was not disappointed. In fact, the brisket is my favorite. Oh BTW: there are no plates, you eat off of a tray lined with paper. I love the concept. The only down side is that the drinks are on the pricey side. If you are looking for a fast-casual BBQ place with quality give this place a try. For the price, it beats Famous Daves, for quality it beats Dickies. I will be bringing more of my friends."}
{"text":"The portions are small for the price, but that's a good thing because the food is mediocre at best.  The brisket is chewy, and the coleslaw has no flavor. The meal comes with bread, not even toast. And the bread was stale. I was expecting Texas Toast, maybe. We were here at 4:30 pm and they were out of ribs and pulled pork from the lunch rush. I don't see where there would be much of a rush. Another member of my party said the chicken next door at Canes is better."}
{"text":"Always up for good BBQ so we tried this one. Had brisket, tri-tip and hot link. Potato salad and mac & cheese for our sides. Brisket was super moist and tender, tri-tip had a good smoke flavor, hot link was not bad either. Both sides were good, potato salad a little more mustard than I care for. Service was quick, order at counter and served on trays."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating hear and my wife and I  both enjoyed it the owner and staff  where  friendly. Our meals arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Awesome !!!! Great food, atmosphere is amazing. server's are kind and genuine. Live for this place !!!  Keep up the great service !!!"}
{"text":"This is my wife and I's go to for BBQ. Today we had the  special: Sandwich with pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket and 2 sides. The portions are so huge neither 1 of us could eat more than 1/2 of the sandwich. The baked beans are really tasty with a hint of heat. I recommend for great BBQ!"}
{"text":"The best barbeque in town. Had dinner here tonight and was amazed at the quality of both the food and the service.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Omg!! ambiance 5 stars food 5 stars staff are friendly amd helpful. I never leave reviews. Today I just had to. Come here. U won't be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating here! The food was delicious.... Service was awesome and the set up inside is cool. The portion was worth the price.  Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Very nice people!!! We have been there for the last 3 Saturday's and will keep going"}
{"text":"Smokey, Savory, Scrumptious, Slap-your-mama-good BBQ!! Spotted this new restaurant while driving by and HAD to try it! Every single item is absolutely perfection! I will recommend Big B's to all of my friends, family, Real Estate clients...people driving by... Amazing!"}
{"text":"The BBQ scene in Henderson is getting even hotter!! Big B's Texas BBQ is now open! And this place does Texas style bbq BIG and proud!  --Menu-- Portions are BIG and Value is BIG  The Plates or Sandwiches combos - each comes with choice of two sides.  1 ($9.99) - 3 meat ($15.99) combo plates, the latter a pretty good deal!  Meats - Brisket, Baby Back, Tri Tip, Chicken, Smoked Turkey, Pulled Pork, Pork Loin, and Hot Links order Ala Carte 1/2 or full orders   Some side choices I saw: corn on cob, creamed corn, Mac & Cheese, baked beans, potato salad, slaw, and salad greens  --On My Tray-- 3 meat combo with brisket, pulled pork and spareribs. Great smoky flavor in the 'cues. . My favorite, was the meaty spareribs! Brisket was good, real lean, moist, but not as tender, just a tad tough for me. Pulled pork was more leaner as well.  Comes with 2 slices of plain, fresh, white bread too. Is that a Texas thing? So no cornbread or corn muffins? I noticed it's MIA on menu.   -amended so after bringing home leftovers,Mr. B noted I didnt get brisket ..but got trip tips instead..no wonder there was no fat...but trip tip slices I got were tough.   Cream corn is irresistible! Get it!. The bbq served had barely any sauce. Bottles are on the tables, so you can control what you want.  Brian said the two bbq sauces on the table are mustard based (small bottle) and ketchup based (larger bottle) both have more peppery note in it with the smaller bottle with more spice and heat.   --Ambiance-- - cafeteria style fast/casual When you order, check out the menu on the wall and tell the guys what you want, go down the line, pick your sides and pay cashier at end of the line.   Bring you lunch money!! AKA CASH!! for now since their register is not online as of this review/  BIG pluses -  Family friendly, plenty of BIG screen televisions, plenty of seating. Dining area make up is communal-style, the get to know your neighbor way. With BIG, long picnic benches throughout. Really nice spot.    - The \"B\" in Big B, must stand for \"backyard\" because this place is BIG, like a huge backyard.  - The \"B\" actually stands for Brian the owner. Just look for the tallest BIG guy there. Cant miss him. Really nice guy too.  --LOCATION-- Main access entry from St Rose Pkwy just off Eastern, Raising Cane's is your visual cue.  Pretty sure you can also access off Sienna Heights if you dont mind wading thru the parking lot where the medical offices are.  --Summary-- Still in soft opening mode, ( we were there 4th hour in)  so keep that in mind people. No paper menus were ready to go yet, hours not posted on door but was told daily hours are 11am - 10pm ...and like I mentioned above, bring cash for now.  Lovin the diversity of barbecue joints we have in our city. Each with something special to offer. In less than six months we've had a couple of bbq joints open up and there is still one more I'm stalking!  Happy to have Big B's Texas BBQ here! Time ya'll make Henderson your destination for barbeque! It's all good!!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about BBQ I've tried it many times and it was ok.  Not my favorite I would only go to BBQ place if a friend or family member  wanted go to one.   Until I found Texas BBQ now I'm telling everyone else about how good it is.   And every one is very friendly and helpful especially for someone new to the efferent options for BBQ.  And they have the best creamed corn."}
{"text":"Update : I left a bad review a few days ago and started receiving texts from the owner and also a reply on my review with her calling me an asshole. VERY PROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE.    The quality of this place has gone soooo down hill. A lot of me and my coworkers used to go here all the time and now... now we all vowed to never return. Last time I went was a couple weeks ago, the brisket was ridiculously dry. I couldn't even finish my meal."}
{"text":"This place is so inviting! The flow of the restaurant is great! The dining area looks like an indoor BBQ picnic area. You can definitely host a large party here! Great for families and kids. Even have space for live music..that would be awesome!  The BBQ was good! They forgot my Mac and cheese which we really wanted to try. They give a piece of sliced white bread with your meal. Which was nice but kind of bleh. Would've been better if it came with cornbread. Or even like a Texas toast maybe? Idk. BBQ sauces were good too but they only had 2 kinds. Reg house made BBQ and a house made mustard BBQ.  Ribs fell off the bone and the hot link sausage was bomb! I need to go back to try the brisket and pulled pork. Oh and that Mac and cheese that they forgot to pack;-)"}
{"text":"This place is the best! They helped me twice pick out the perfect combination of foods and quantities needed for gatherings. Everyone loved their food and sides...the ribs, tri tip and brisket were big hits, as was the potato salad and mashed potatoes. Pretty sure you won't go wrong with anything they prepare!"}
{"text":"I got ribs and pulled pork sandwich; brought most of it home. Both were more fatty than I can handle. My dog wouldn't even eat the pulled pork. Ribs were overcooked as well. Personally, I couldn't detect the smoke flavor. All the sides I had were bad enough that I tossed them...beans mostly vinegar, for example. Stouffer's makes better mac and cheese. I had BBQ at Sunny Bryan's in Dallas years ago and brought home a gallon of sauce. It's not the top-rated cue in Dallas now, but better than this place still. Low and slow is the name of the game and they aren't winning it. Also could do without the country music. Fiddles without the lovesick moaning would be an improvement."}
{"text":"Yuummmmmmmy ! I came here for the soft opening of Big Bs Texas BBQ and I feel like I'm eating at a friends house. The bbq is premium, the restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.   Today I got the #2 - 2 meat plate (13.99).It comes with two sides of your choice and bread. I got the tri tip and hot link for the meats and the potato salad and corn on the cob for the sides. They were out of the mac and cheese (sad) but I'll be back to try it amongst the other meats like the brisket, ribs, smoked salmon, salads...  The interior has 5. TVs and bench seating everywhere. Great big space and decor made for an enjoyable experience.   Thanks guys! I'll be back for more soon !"}
{"text":"I loved it when it opened but it's been going down hill fast. I've ate there probably 10 times and each time is worse than the last. Today I had a brisket plate. I've been burping smoke taste since. The Mac and cheese was like soup literally. My okra was so over cooked I couldn't eat it. Must be a different cook? I think they are smoking with green mesquite. I'm done."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews, but unfortunately this establishment needs an overhaul on management. I have never been treated this way, as a customer, in my life. I got a coupon in my local mailer for this place so decided to give them a try. Order taker was pleasant and explained the menu. Then told me I was in the wrong line to order takeout and directed me to the other window. OK. New line, new service person and the first question he asked was,\"Is this for here or to go?\" Hello!  Anyway I ordered #1 meat plate brisket, #5 Po Boy pulled pork, and pulled pork sandwich w/ fries.  I waited in a chair for them to prepare my meal. The service person said, \"I will put the bbq sauce in the bag for you\". OK, great. The order was ready within 5 minutes.  When I got home, I opened the bag to find no sauce and no pulled pork sandwich. Since it was the end of a long day, I didn't have the strength to return to the establishment, so I called and talked to an employee. He put the manager, Brian, on the phone and I began to explain the situation to him. He rudely interrupted me and said, \"Our employees do not place BBQ sauce in the bag. We can't afford to give away extra sauce\".  I explained that I was told they would put it in and I didn't get extra, in fact I got none at all\". He replied, \"I should have gotten my own. It was on the counter.\" \"OK, What about my pulled pork sandwich they didn't give me? Can they deliver it?\" Brian explained they don't have delivery service then said, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" \"Well, since you are asking, can you refund my debit transaction?\"  To this I got a lecture about how he can't afford to do that because of a mistake made by a $10 per hour employee. Well this took the cake, and I loudly replied, \"That is really not my problem.\" He finally said, \"Come by some time in the future and I'll give you a free sandwich.\"  I told him never mind, but he should seriously think about taking a course on business and customer service. So brisket was dry and tasteless, pulled pork dry, mac and cheese was good, beans were good, coleslaw bad and fries limp and soggy. I hope someone at least teaches Brian some manners or this place will not be here for long."}
{"text":"I thought this BBQ spot was average. Nothing stood out, but nothing bad to say. I ordered a two meat plate; smoked turkey and baby back ribs with baked beans and mac/cheese.   I had to send the mac/cheese back, as it was extremely watery. It also lacked flavor. The server was very nice and advised there were several patrons who had sent back their mac n cheese for the same issue. So, not sure if it was a bad batch. Why even serve it?   Turkey was great! Very moist and flavorful. The baby back ribs were dry.   The staff is very nice and professional."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and had a great overall experience!    The staff was helpful knowing it was my first time there.  I chose the tri tip and moist brisket (you can get it not as moist as well).  Both were delicious and did not even need more barbecue sauce even by my standards - and I'm a huge condiment person.  The sides I chose were pasta salad and creamed corn.  Both came in generous size servings and complimented the meats well.    I liked the decor of the place with its picnic table seating and high ceilings, making it feel like you are on a ranch or barn somewhere.  The country music also helped set the mood.   Great place and I would definitely go back again!  I need to save room for dessert next time!"}
{"text":"We tried Big Bs on a whim. Thank goodness we did! Right when you walk in the door that BBQ hits your nose and it's heavenly! The food was so delicious. We ordered sliders which came with 2 healthy sized servings of sides. Probably way more than I can eat but you can bet it's all getting eaten! The turkey and pulled pork were so yummy. The tri-tip was better than the brisket. The mac'n'cheese is heavenly, the cheese is so stringy. I can't rave enough about the food. It hit the BBQ spot and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Big B's bbq this place is awesome and the people are great best tri tip and brisket and the rolls are amazing                       Awesome place"}
{"text":"All the Texas transplants in Vegas held their collective breaths when they heard a Texas-style BBQ joint was opening in Henderson (of all places!). Well, I'm from the 210 and this place is fairly legit. I'd tweak a few things but the meats are solid, and that's the main thing that matters.   Got a two meat plate (with two sides) and a poboy- smoked turkey was generously served and moist, I'd definitely come back for that! Beef hot link was poppin', and BF said their BBQ sauce was some of the best he'd had since we left TX. Sides aren't to be missed either: the mac was saucy and distinctly smoky, and we fought over who got to finish the BBQ beans (and I usually don't like them at all!).   Had a few issues with the poboy (note the $1.50 fee for brisket or tri tip)- the brisket comes shredded? That ain't how they do it down in SA, and thankfully I saw it in time to ask for it to be remade with sliced (though I was originally met with resistance). The sliced is leaner than I'm used to, and not quite as juicy, but it was better than most Vegas versions. And where were the pickles and onions?!  Interior is done up with picnic tables and old-school bulb lights, with plenty of paper towels and sauce bottles on each table. Dining in might be the better option, as I got attitude and inconvenience when I asked for cups of sauce for my takeout order- apparently there were only a few ready and the cashier couldn't give out cups to pack my own, so I had to open up my takeout boxes at the tables and add sauce inside (getting it all over everything). Not thrilled.  Management (Brian?) was on point though- ribs looked incredible (will be coming back to try them!) but weren't falling-off-the-bone tender yet, so he held off serving them until they were ready, which I thought was good quality control. Line staff and cashiers seem to be in need of some training in the area of Southern hospitality though."}
{"text":"Omg!! I love this freaking place- the brisket & tri tip are amazing!! & the mac n cheese- it ain't my grandma's, but it is soooo good!! Fried okra, well another good choice that brings me back home in the South Carolina!! Thank you for finally making it on EAT 24!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, I tried the brisket meat plate, with fries and potato salad, my partner had the trip tip with beans as a side, of the sides I enjoyed the beans the most, they were very well seasoned. Brisket was very nice and moist. Their sauces were both on the sweeter side but not overly so, i enjoyed them even though I normally go for a spicier style it was a nice change. Great experience overall the staff were very friendly and helpful with ordering. My only regret is I wish I had eaten there to enjoy the ambiance and have my meal fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great owner! My husband found this place near his work when it had just opened and tried it. He then brought me and we've been bringing more people ever since. The food is delicious and keeps getting better. We have talked with the owner several times and his passion is obvious. He is always looking for ways to make the food even better and it's working! Definitely a great barbecue place!"}
{"text":"Great ribs and the tri tip was so juicy.  Will come again! Only ordered for take out. Called in was ready 15 min later when I arrived packaged with a smile.  Would like to try eating in when my two year old isn't so... two."}
{"text":"Great smokey flavor that really allows you to taste the meat and not so much smothered in sauce. However I do wish there were more sauces to try from. But their 'cream-corn' and ribs are tasty!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas we really enjoyed eating here. The staff was super friendly, helpful and very willing to make suggestions based on preference. We had 4 kids with us who can be very picky and each of them had something to eat they liked and got full."}
{"text":"Wow.  Some of the best BBQ of my life!  Everything is just on point.  I had a three meat combo with baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Cole slaw and beans for sides.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner at Big B's last night, which was a little surprising for two reasons: we got there just before closing, and we're from Texas -- so we know good BBQ. Truly, I wish my family had more of an appetite because I wanted to go back up and order more of the meats they were so good!  The meal plates apparently are 1/4 lb servings times the number of meats you get, plus sides, or you can order meats a la carte by the 1/2 lb or 1/2 rack. We got 1/2 lb of tri-tip and 1/2 rack of ribs, both of which were expertly done and quite wonderful despite the hour. The ribs come out dry (meaning no sauce, not dried out) and while they have a bottle of sauce on the table it wasn't the rich style of southern sweet bbq sauce that I prefer, however the ribs were plenty flavorful without.  The mac n cheese was also quite amazing, and that's arguably harder to find than good meats! Really rich and thick like it should be -- real cheese is in there. Lots of bottled drinks and a Coke Freestyle machine too (100+ sodas).   Overall, Big B's Texas BBQ really is worthy of the name, and I'd bet someone in the business is a geographically challenged Texan ;-)"}
{"text":"Wife got sick about an hour after eating there.  I called the Manager and he said he ate the same thing but was fine.  I asked him to have the owner contact me.  Wife got sick from their potato salad and we ended up in the Emergency Room at the hospital that evening with food poisoning.    Owner did not call back.  I called back four days later to voice my concern and the Manager (Allie) said she would give the owner (Brian) the message. Brian finally called me back and was more concerned with defending the restaurant and telling me the Doctor didn't know what he was talking about than addressing the problem.  I wasn't looking for anything more than him acknowledging that he was sorry that it happened.  He only apologized for not calling me back.  Obviously didn't care about the welfare of my wife. One restaurant checked off my places to eat"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant we were a little confused. Finally we figured out where to order. You order first, then sit down. It smelled so good inside! It would have been a little more convenient to have been seated, then look at a menu, then order but oh well. We were shocked at the amount of food you get. It's amazing how much you get your money's worth there. My family of 3 could have split one \"small\" meal. The meats were good. The food was overall descent. My husband liked that they had shiner bock on tap.  It would have been better to have gotten takeout."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is decent, brisket is dry and over trimmed, jalape√±o cheese hot link is practically a cured meat stick.  Overall the sad truth is sauce is a must, which is a sign of mediocre bbq.  The regular sauce is fine but nothing stands out and the mustard sauce is fine, but personally not my thing.  Mac and cheese isn't bad but again, nothing special.  Fries are fine as is the corn bread, but the corn bread is more sweet corn muffin than the crumbly corn bread you'd expect.  Nothing is bad, but nothing is particularly good, and overall I feel I could have spent my caloric consumption on something better."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas, my girlfriend and I really wanted to try something cool in Vegas that wasn't in Los Angeles. I had a hankering for BBQ, so we happened to find Big B's.  Only a few miles away from the strip in Henderson was this gem.  The food was amazing and the staff treated us great.  I got the pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. Paired with baked beans, potatoes, and Mac and cheese.  Amazing!  Parking was plenty.  If you are in the Vegas area and crave BBQ, def hit up Big B's."}
{"text":"Update! Visit#2 in 2 weeks....Lol   I tried the 3 meat combo so that I could get the brisket... Tri tip and of course the smoked turkey. :)   The brisket was very tender and juicy and it just pulled apart... And it had a great smoke ring... With just the right amount of smoke flavor to it. (4.5/5)  Smoked? turkey... Still gotta say it's a 5/5... So freaking delicious! Will most definitely be getting this again...  Tri tip... This is where they surprised me.... It was so good!!! It was just like the brisket and had a great smoke ring and smoky flavor but the reason why this is a 5/5 and ranked higher in my books compared to the brisket was that the meat flavor came through and just really balanced the flavor to make it even better then the brisket. So freaking delicious!!!!  Gotta come back.... I've missed my Texas BBQ and this is the place to come and get some!!  ***************************************************   I gotta tell ya.... When you walk in...Omg the smell of the smoke just blows your mind or rather your nose...lol The smell brought me back to walking into bbq joints in Texas.... And the actual set up brought me firmly back to fun memories of sitting on picnic tables in the BBQ joints in my college days... Made me very nostalgic! :) And you have to love the paper towel holders in every section of the picnic tables. Ambiance (5/5)  Now does this place compare to pecan Lodge or Lockhart's in Dallas or the hole in the wall joints in Austin... Or county line... Or Rudy's.... Or Franklin's or the original salt lick in Austin....??  I gotta say no... Compared to them they are not that great.... BUT compared to any other BBQ joint here in Vegas... They are number 1 in my books. Now I know where I will go if I'm craving some Texas BBQ!! I'm just mad that I waited this long to try them! Lol  I had a bite of the bf's pulled pork and it had just the right amount of smoke and it was so juicy and flavorful! So yummy!! His fries and Mac and cheese were also delicious!!! So far so good! (5/5)  I got the 2 meat combo...I paid the $5 extra to get baby back ribs on the combo. Boy am I glad that I did!! The smoke ring and the bark on the ribs... So yummy! (4.5/5) it was a little dry towards the end of the slab.... But it was one of the best ribs I've had here in Vegas! The meat was tender and very flavorful and it was meaty!!! I've had some ribs that were just bone with teeny tiny bits of meat on there but the ribs here has some delicious chunks of meat with the perfect amount of fat running through it.  For my second meat, I got the smoked turkey and you might be asking yourself.... Really???? Smoked turkey in a BBQ joint? Wth??? But I gotta tell ya... I've had some amazing smoked turkey in Texas and when I saw it...I had to try it. And they did not disappoint! It was tender, Succulent and the lightly Smoky. It was so good! (5/5)  I can't forget the sides...I had the fried okra... Delish! Perfectly crunchy and fried to perfection so that there was no sliminess! (5/5) the creamed corn on the other hand was a little too sweet for my taste buds and not as creamy as I was expecting...I guess the creamed corn at Rudy's had ruined me...Lol (4/5)  Overall, Big B's Texas BBQ brought back nostalgic memories of eating delicious bbq in Texas which I was sorely missing here in Vegas....I can't wait to come back and try the brisket and the tri-tip.... My mouth is watering just thinking about the great meats I had here."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas. This stuff is great. BIG fan of the turkey and the tri tip! Mac and cheese is on point. Love that I can get my fix of that delicious brisket too! There is always room for improvement though, a few times the sides were not even warm. But nothing that a kind word of request wouldn't fix! I'll keep returning for that SMOKED meat and ICE COLD Shiner!"}
{"text":"The bbq was good, but it wasn't great!  I had the three meat platter that consisted of chicken, ribs and brisket.  They serve the meats dry (without sauce) on a piece of carving paper.  The meal included cole slaw and a corn muffin.  The results:  The chicken was very dry and needed to be drenched in sauce to allow it to be edible.  The ribs were good and very smokey.  They were cooked perfectly, but needed additional sauce.  The brisket was sliced very thin and had a nice smoke ring.  It also needed sauce to enhance the flavor.  The sides were average, but the bbq sauce was very flavorful and the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"We found Big B's on a Vegas foodie blog and inquired them out to cater an upcoming birthday dinner party.    It was important for us to select a local vendor.   We spoke to both owners - Brian and Natalia - multiple times prior to visiting their establishment.  They suggested for us to come in and try some samples.   We complied...and glad we did!    Upon arriving, we saw Brian roaming the floor and greeting customers.  Excellent sign for future business success getting feedback directly from his diners.  The restaurant smelled amazing and we knew we'd be in for a treat.    Amy, the shift manager, took care of us.  She asked about of party size, our tastes and food expectations. She began bringing out samples of the meats and sides for us to try, all the while making suggestions on throwing the best party possible.  Amy knew what she was talking about and you could tell she loved her job.  I got the same vibe from all of the people I encountered working at Big B's.  Brian set the tone.  His food knowledge expertise and ease with talking to customers was evident.    We got the party meal for 30-35 people.  We chose brisket, pulled pork and smoked turkey.  All smoked to perfection and juicy.   We wanted to make sliders, so we opted for slaw, potato salad, pasta salad and baked beans as our side dishes.  Also included was a tin of pickles, onions and jalapenos.  The making for a real down home, Texas BBQ party!  When it came time to pick up our order the next day, Amy checked and double checked our order for its accuracy.  All we had to do was load everything into the car and go!   Extremely efficient and stress-free experience!  Everything was placed in the serving tins with care for optimal visual pleasure.  It arrived \"presentable\" with minimal effort from me at set up.  Included were plates, silverware, serving utensils and a variety BBQ sauce.  An absolute turnkey experience.    Our guests raved at the BBQ choices!  We were extremely pleased with how above and beyond Big B's took care of us.  Many of our guests ate more than one plate and enjoyed their food.  Couldn't have asked for a better catering experience.   If you have a party, do not hesitate to have Big B's cater.  They will take exceptional care of your needs."}
{"text":"Great people working here and extremely friendly owner! The ribs were great, and the tri-tip as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I've had many BBQ places and this was by far one of the best. Brisket is moist, tri tip has a lot of flavor and the spicy sausage was very delicious. Their beans are very flavorful with a few types of beans and meat and the potato salad was made fresh...overall you won't be disappointed. The staff too was great with excellent customer service!! Go to Big Bs BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent bbq...surprised us. Highly recommended. Owner greeted us personally. Five star rating."}
{"text":"Probably the best bbq in town! Was hesitant at first, but surprised as soon as I tried their bbq. Plus, what makes it great is the ambience of their restaurant! Trust me, you'll definitely come back once you experience it!! Especially, their ribs!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Mac & Cheese!  Loved the Tri-Tip and Brisket  and hands down best customer service!  The owner looks like Channing Tatum and he's awesome so that's a plus"}
{"text":"I finally got to swing in for lunch with the homies. I was a little apprehensive at first because there was only a few people at lunch on a weekday.  We were greeted with a big smile by the owner who walked us through the menu. I opted for the beef ribs cuz that's how I do. For sides I chose Mac n cheese as well as coleslaw. They were both really good. While we were waiting the owner brought out some free fried okra which was really well done.  We chatted a little and she offered to gives us some of the mesquite wood they use. Super nice.   Everything was very clean, food was great and I look forward to going back and trying the chicken!"}
{"text":"I loved it here. Huge portion of food at a fair price point. Friendly staff, clean facility. Great experience overall. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So good! We got the 3 meat plate with tri tip, smoked turkey, and chicken shredded up. All of it was delicious! Comes with a 1/4 of each meat and two sides for 17.99.  Baked beans, mac and cheese, and with our yelp check in hot potato salad! Also got a half rack of baby back ribs and they were meaty crispy and moist, amazing! We know Texas BBQ and it definitely didn't disappoint. Smoky but not too much, moist but not wet! We will be back for sure. I'm glad this place is right up the street.  Thanks Jessica for being patient and helpful while we decided. All the staff was friendly and checked on us multiple times!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time here... everything was SO GOOD ... we will definitely be back!!!    The macaroni and cheese was the best I've ever had, same thing with the baked beans. And the meat... so good. My husband got the hot links and the turkey breast and they were both delicious. I got the tri-tip and it was outstanding.    The restaurant was clean  with. country cute decor, with fun old time music. The owner even came by to say hello.   We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Tri tip and brisket Mahalo @bigbzbbq for a yummy in the tummy! The have a \"secret menu\" that consists of a baked potatoe loaded with your choice of protein and side. I did the pulled pork and Mac n cheese! Sounds crazy but believe me, it was BOMB!!!!! Keep in mind that that mix was something I just randomly came up with hahaha the cook even said \"that's the first!\" But seriously though.... so good!   #bigbzbbq #tritipsteak #brisket #creamedCorn #coleslaw #corncob #bombdotcom #lvfoodie #hendersonfoodie #lasvegas #foodbelly #texasbbq #hulaandfood #myfave #soOno #oiishi #tongueGameStrong"}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for authentic BBQ unlike any other!   You are first greeted in the parking lot by the unmistakable aroma of smoked meats, beckoning you into the humble strip mall location. But don't let the inconspicuous location and modest atmosphere deter you; when you're smoking meats at a first class level like they are, I couldn't care less what environment I'm shoveling saucy, smoked meats into my mouth- judge me all you want!   My personal favorite is the moist cut brisket. It almost melts in your mouth and is great all on its own or on a sandwich. I have also tried the pulled pork and tri tip, also both delicious. The tri tip is so tender and has a texture that makes me think of the most deluxe, steaky (great adjective!) beef jerky ever! Portions are substantial and the menu is very reasonably priced; a great way to mix up a boring lunch routine without breaking the bank.   They also have several side options; pick two with any plate or sandwich. My favorites have been their Mac and cheese as well as their fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"I have no idea where people get their taste for food. All the meats were dry except the pulled pork. The baked beans were quite possibly the best thing there. The corn on the cob has the consistency of frozen and is very mushy. The pasta salad was decent. The macaroni and cheese may as well be bulk. Runny, runny, runny. I cannot recommend nor will I be back ."}
{"text":"Someone bought us lunch from big b's and it was amazing!!! A staff of 13 women and it was a hit !!! Not bikini season portions but well worth the splurge!!! The owner seemed very hands on and friendly. The indoor dining area was adorable and very family friendly! We will be back"}
{"text":"Oh Boy! Was I excited to go to that place. Nice clean entry, great directions and the fragrance, love the smoky BBQ smell right when walking in the door. Nice welcome by staff and I guess Big B; well if it was Big B, he talks fast... but It does not matter it adds great character... we got a sample while reading the menu. Finally decided to have a 2 meat plate with pork ribs and beef link, two sides and a 1 meat plate with two sides, we decided for beef ribs... so my first disappointment was when I saw that the beef ribs have not been cooked the day of my visit :(:( they cut them up fully cooked, cold and stiff, then throw them on the grill :( The other order we have not been very satisfied either but at least the meat of the pork ribs fell right off the bone! Nice! But again it did not felt like it was cooked the day of our visit :( the sides, well... mac and cheese tasted not good... too mushy, maybe over cooked and under seasoned, the BBQ beans, good taste and flavor but too much sauce, French fries had awesome flavor if they would have been crispy threat would have been great .... best French fries ever! The coleslaw salad was absolutely the best of our meal.  If the beef rib meat would have fallen of the bone that would have been nice too, but it has been quiet a chewy cave women experience :/ the beef link tasted okay...  Unfortunately I might not go back due to my first experience :/  Overall a bit pricy for what we got."}
{"text":"Man, finally a real barbecue on this side of town. No amateurs, no chains. The real deal. Pros who know meat and sides.  Tried 3 meats: tri tip, smoked turkey, and the best brisket I have had in years. Sauce in bottles on the table, where it ought to be,  not on the meat. Really nice sized servings.  Sides are very accomplished; nice coleslaw with a hint of mayo and not soaked in it, outstanding Mac and cheese, and fries that easily rival Five Guys.  Took some home made apple pie home. Willing to bet that's good too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Last month was a crazy month for my company and we ordered in food for the entire office for 2 weeks straight! One of the days we got Big B's and it was wonderful! Food was prepared fresh and served to our employees! They did not just drop off the food and leave like everyone else they were very attentive and polite and the food was amazing! The baked beans are just as good as I had heard! I highly recommend Big B's for any catering event for the quality of the food and the spot on service! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The food is great. We've been several times and have tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed in the food.   My only complaint is the service. Everyone always seems very confused, and I just don't know why. It seems like the ordering process is pretty straight forward but boy does it always cause confusion!! Today there were four people staring at a tray with the order ticket in their hand, trying to figure out if the order was correct! I had a to-go order, and had to wait about 10 minutes which seemed like a long time for an ordinary (not large) order to go. And then I got home and they had given me tri tip instead of brisket. I should have checked the order, especially after sitting watching pure chaos for 10 minutes, lol. Luckily I like the tri tip, but I really wanted brisket.   Bottom line is it's 5 star food, but less than stellar service."}
{"text":"I get excited when I get to try new BBQ places that open in the Las Vegas valley. I am very picky with my BBQ and am not ashamed to say that I will speak up when I eat bad Q, this is LEGIT Q!!!   I ordered the 3 meat plate with 2 sides.  Tri Tip- moist, perfectly smoked, tender and melted in my mouth.  Brisket- asked for the cap (fatty side). The guy taking my order went out of his way to make sure I got what I was asking for. Perfect smoke ring, so juicy and full of flavor.  Pulled Pork- This is where I am super picky, pulled pork is a specialty of mine. Let me say that this did not disappoint!! Once again, great flavor, juicy and perfectly smoked.  Mac-n-cheese- this is the way Mac is supposed to be cooked, trust me it won't let ya down!  Beans- beans were good but not my favorite but I didn't complain one bit as I was shoveling them in my mouth! Haha I am more of a sweet baked bean fan.  Sauces- Both sauces are great but I am a no sauce type of Q fan and the meal didn't need sauce, the food stands alone with great flavor!  They do it up real at this gem, cutting meats and serving sides right in front of you, just like the big boy Q joints in Texas."}
{"text":"Most authentic BBQ spot in Vegas. I have been to some of the more famous BBQ spots across the country and this place fits right in. The ribs were tender and fell right off of the bone, the tri-tip was smokey with the right amount of fattiness and my favorite part was actually the jalape√±o cheese sausage. The Mac and cheese was average but the creamed corn was outstanding. I wish I would have tried the baked beans, they looked really good. The decor was awesome. From the picnic tables with rolls of paper towels, to the food served on parchment paper with sliced bread and the beer on tap. If they would have had some kind of cream pie or key lime for dessert it would have completed the experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Big B's Texas BBQ is the real deal BBQ. I  had baby back ribs and tri-trip, bbq beans, and mac and cheese. The BOMB !!!!!  Way too much food at once ,but great leftovers. Picnic atmosphere inside is fun and casual. Staff is super nice, food is awesome,  you gotta try some when your in Henderson Nv. We live in Summerlin  and we're coming back, its that good. Try it , you'll like it !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super tasty. The tri tip is my favorite. Clean and new, and the staff is polite and helpful."}
{"text":"This is a good bque place. All the meats were good. Could be a little more seasoned. I like the tri tip and the moist brisket. The coleslaw is mustard base and I liked that. There are TV's and picnic tables in the restaurant. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Kind of mixed feelings about this place. They could really make something out of it but are falling short of their potential. As far as their smoked meats, they are really good. I have not run across other place that can smoke meat as well. However, their sides are slightly below average. Going even further, what is really holding them back are all the small things. You can get a sandwich from them with awesome meat, but served on an un-toasted bun that looks like it came from Wal-mart. At least toast the bun! Also, some of their sauces like ranch, are not made fresh and have the distinctive taste of coming from a bottle, like a cheap plastic Kraft bottle. I don't think they are even getting it wholesale. Also, every time I go there the prices continue to increase, and its not always represented on the menu. The whole place reeks of poor management and execution. It is a real shame because their meats are so good, but I think they need to start having more consistent pricing, and either make their buns and sauces themselves, or at least buy it wholesale."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas. Hands down. I've eaten there 4x and had them cater 2 events and always impressed. Great customer service."}
{"text":"My new favorite BBQ spot in Vegas! Great food and friendly staff! Go and check it out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and was a great experience all round. It was very busy but our table was sat almost immediately by warm and welcoming staff. Looking at the menu i was really confused about what i should try but the staff were extremely informative and helped me by recommending some of the house favourites, it was absolutely delicious and served quickly. I would definitely visit again! I never write reviews but felt this restaurant deserved it"}
{"text":"We are residents of Henderson and just finished our first (of many to come) dining experience at Big B's.  In a few words, it's fantastically delicious.  In addition, the owner Brian, who we met and is very cordial, does the cooking of his own recipes.  Brian is also a \"big\" guy so it's pretty easy to see where the name Big B's comes from.  Everyone was super friendly and the food was outstanding.  Be aware Brian has some wonderful recipes and his preparation is different than anything we had ever experienced.  I say that because my wife ordered the baby-backs and when they came they appeared to be dry and overcooked.  Don't be fooled---they're fabulous when you bite into them.  I had the Tri tip----also tender and loaded with flavor.  I shared one half piece of Tri with my wife but ate two of her ribs.  She said that wasn't fair so we ordered a take out order just to pacify her.  We'll be going back many many times. We've tried some of the other so called BBQ places in town over the years, but thank God Brian located in Henderson.  Knowing now how tasty everything is I would drive as far as it took just to eat there (maybe not Texas).  If you try this place pretty sure you will love it like we did.  p.s.  It's larger than it looks and can easily accommodate large party's."}
{"text":"SERVICE: My friends and I checked out this place for the VERY first time (3/1/2018). This was a great choice since I was with male carnivores, and let me tell you... the staffs were friendly, attentive, and simply amazing! They explain to you how the menu works, the different sauces, especially since it was our first time.   FOOD: Again, like mentioned before... the company I brought to this establishment were carnivorous males, and the food was quite filling. Hence, some of my friends tapped out with how the food here filled their hunger to fullest of full!    ATMOSPHERE: I loved how everything in the restaurant was efficient and straightforward. From the easy to read menus, to the seating, and the family-friendly environment. My friends and I truly enjoyed this place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Just a basic bbq joint. The meats had good flavor and were pretty tender. There was only 1 bbq sauce to choose from aside from the mustard sauce... who uses mustard on bbq? I had the Mac n cheese and baked beans. The sides were very tasty."}
{"text":"Literally the best BBQ in Vegas and I should know because I've been binging barbecue since moving to LV one year ago. The Tri-Tip is the best; tender and light. The brisket is a second best though it is missing the mesquite that I'm used to from back home in Chicago.   I love the openness of the dining area and the sturdy lacquered picnic tables. If you want a laid back mid-level hangout the place is also packed with flat screens, mostly playing sports.  As for sides, the fried okra deep-fried because it was a little soft but the mac was the business!!!  Fairly priced and awesome bro staff!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  The owner walked around, asked everyone how their food was and refilled guests drinks. Excellent food!  We had brisket, ribs and pulled pork. All was fabulous. Okra was cooked to perfection!  Fries are fresh cut and great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit at this BBQ spot. Friendly staff, clean facility and amazing food. The corn bread and brisket were my absolute favorite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. The food is amazing! The baked beans are probably the best I've ever had and the ribs are really meaty and have great flavor. This place has great food and is very reasonably priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good bbq place in Vegas for the longest time, and finally found it! You can really tell they put good care into their meet- it's delicious! HIGHLY recommend the smoked turkey, it was so flavorful! The staff was super attentive, and the owners even came to see how we were doing. Not something you see at every restaurant... 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I hope to give them 5 stars some day. Their brisket is already fantastic, and is the reason for the 4 stars. I've eaten an obscene amount of brisket over the years including in Texas, and this stands up to Texas brisket. However, the staff were kind of unorganized when it came to processing the orders, which I think will improve with time. They were friendly at least. Also, the sides need work. The fries were ok but lacked seasoning, the corn on the cob was burnt and without butter, and the mac n cheese had too much smoke flavor. The last time I ordered it, I couldn't eat it because it was the texture of mac but the taste of campfire smoke. Reel it in, folks. Dairy is delicate. I hope they improve the sides so that this can become my go-to bbq joint. (We need this in Vegas!) For now I'll just order the meat, though."}
{"text":"Pros: Big place with long picnic tables Portions are great Friendly employees and service oriented Potato salad Coleslaw Fried okra ... and most importantly, fall off the rib baby backs, moist and very juicy briskets, and quality fri tips! BBQ sauce was good too!  Cons (yes, there's never an honest review without one): Cream of corn was too salty (but the Owner owned up to it & quickly apologized without hesitation and asked me to choose another, plus offered her favorite) Mac and cheese was a bit on dry side but still tasty Fries were not that crispy Had some dry/tough ends on ribs which they should never serve to a customer No wetnaps   All in all, it's a BBQ joint Texas style so it's all about the quality of the meat right?! This place has that hands down. Hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite BBQ in the valley.  Great to see local restaurants delivering the promise of great service and food.   Last night I went with my favorite of brisket and pulled pork.   The brisket is the best in the city.  Highly recommend it.  We will be back"}
{"text":"One of the top two BBQ joints in the valley, for sure! (Rollin' Smoke is the other) I've been everywhere else, grew up in Beef Country and can out-cook most every place here myself. I met my match with Big B's. His beans are AMAZING! The brisket is fantastic, as is the turkey. The tri-tip is the best I've had anywhere. The fries are just SO good. I'm not thrilled about the rest of the sides, but his beans and fries are so good, they get all 5 stars. The hot links are not foolin' around. They are SPICY, but fantastic! Anybody who drives to Texas to bring in the mesquite wood is doing all right by me. I'm a fan, live in Henderson and am REALLY glad I don't have to drive up to Rollin' Smoke for fantastic BBQ any longer."}
{"text":"I almost clicked 5 stars, and there's just two small things I don't like, but the food is so worth it that I'll keep going back.   I've had the brisket, tri-tip, ribs and the turkey. All the meats taste great. Big portions, no sauce covering it like other places. I'll go back to try the other meats.   Sides.... Cole Slaw and beans are yummy. I've had the Mac and Cheese too, but it wasn't hot (temp) enough for me. My GF had the corn on the cob (no complaints from her).  Ok, my 2 issues, and I know it's a Texas thing. I don't like the tray plate they use. I know, get over it. I'll \"suffer\" if I have to eat that yummyness. The other small thing, seating isn't too comfy. Once again, I'll live.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly, accommodating and helpful.   Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Loveeee this place, omg if you're in Vegas and you're craving for a good BBQ place this is the spot to go to! My husband and I have tried numerous BBQ places in Vegas but Big B's BBQ is the best so far! We took 3 meal plate with brisket, ribs and beef links plus Mac and cheese, coleslaw and the biscuits and we barely finished it, it was so much food but most importantly everything was DELICIOUS! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Natalia, you really have made this place the go to place for BBQ. I'm impressed with the reviews and service you provide to your customers. Keep it up. \"Big B's Texas BBQ will crush the competition\". Best wishes   Sincerely,   Worldpay"}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place. The pulled pork was amazing. Tri tip had tons of smoke flavor. Mac and cheese was creamy. The restaurant itself is big and open and very welcoming. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Grew up in Texas. This place does it absolutely right. Best BBQ I've had outside of Texas."}
{"text":"Big b's has a solid foundation to be a killer bbq spot, however they do need to refine in a few areas. They have an amazing indoor offset pit that you can see if you peer over rhe counter and lool towards the back, their selection is plentiful, and the meats are cooked to the proper doneness. That said, my first issue is the wood. Mesquite is an outstanding smoking wood but only after the bark has been removed. Bark on mesquite puts off heavy smoke with a slight shade of greenness. That is the carcinogens in the smoke that causes bitterness in the meat, and makes your mouth slightly numb and tingly when you eat. Not good eats. 2nd, the brisket was in my opinion lacking flavor, I am used to a thick seasoning rub that absorbs into the meat during cooking. The place has a fun atmosphere and will be bringing friends as I live only about a mile away. I will also be giving subtle suggestions to get that darn bark off that mesquite."}
{"text":"The BBQ here was really good. My BF and I shared a 3 meat plate and an order of hot links. I was skeptical of the cheese/jalapeno hot links my BF wanted but that was my all time favorite.  We also got the brisket, ribs and pulled pork.  All were good but the cheese/jalapeno hot links beat them all.    They have two sauces on the table. One was a regular bbq sauce the second one was very vinagery which wasn't bad but it was different. Interesting tasting. Not my favorite.  They also have a spicy sauce you have to ask for and that was actually very good.  Their sides were just ok. Not great and even though I heard good things about their BBQ Beans, it was watery and more like chili to me than BBQ beans.  Overall, we'll be back again.  We even had leftovers for lunch the next day.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't care for was the corn on the cob, it tastes frozen, definitely not fresh but the the tri tip and baked beans were delish!"}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to try this place.  I ordered the tri tip plate with macaroni and cheese, and coleslaw.  I really enjoyed my meal.  The tri tip was tender and tasty and my two sides were really yummy.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  I had to give Big B's Texas BBQ 4 stars because I wished they had more than just one BBQ sauce.  I like my BBQ sauce spicy and sweet.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok after ordering here multiple times I'm seeing I reviewed too fast while not getting more experience with this place....food is still good.but they are getting more sloppy as the orders go. This time  $50 order and the BBQ sauce spills in the bag they serve it to me anyways... slippery,soggy and disgusting. I also ordered the well done brisket but got the fatty tender brisket which we didn't want on all three orders. Frustrating when you're dropping BBQ sauce thru your house to get it in the kitchen.then the guy just looked at me like I wasn't worthy of clean takeout utensils and bags after I tipped 20% and asked if he would be ok with paying $50 for an order that looked this sloppy."}
{"text":"Another BBQ score, this time in Vegas, they had me as soon on as I walked in!  Why you say, well it was the deep rich smokey BBQ smell that you would expect at a place like this.  Huge open kitchen where you can watch them carve your meats and dish out your sides, plus flat screens to keep you entertained.  I went for the food belly coma 3 meat combo with the fatty juicy delicious brisket, the surprisingly good beef tri-tip (think BBQ roast beef just sliced thicker), and the underwhelming baby back ribs that were under-seasoned and flat.  But they had 2 very good homemade BBQ sauces, a mustard and sweet BBQ that were very good.  Add excellent corn muffins with hint of cinnamon, and all 3 sides were spot on!  The creamy tangy cole slaw, the deep truffle like cheesy Mac and cheese, and the best BBQ beans that had hint of strong vinegar and meat that made me happily pucker.  Overall a solid 4 ate BBQ feast of the Gods."}
{"text":"As soon as you open the door you are welcomed with the best smelling BBQ. This is the best barbecue place in town my favorite items were the chicken, ribs, Mac and cheese, and the corn bread. The employees were very kind. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight and all I have to say is amazing. The service was top notch, the atmosphere made us feel like we were back in Texas, and the food was hands down the best BBQ we have ever eaten. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thought this would be run of the mill, being that it is more of a faster-food type thing...not the case! I ordered a three meat combo with two sides and ate of that goodness for DAYS! felt like a had a bomb-ass deli in my fridge! Sooo worth it. That smoked turkey!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the service & employees were very friendly. Nice atmosphere, clean & not crowded. Good beer selection as well.   However, I have to move onto the negatives. I see this place has many good reviews, which is great. We must have caught them on a bad day.  My brisket..was so bad. I understand brisket is a fatty meat, but this literally felt like eating gelatinous, uncooked strips of grey meat. The only flavor it had came from what tasted like liquid smoke, because it lacked that genuine BBQ flavor that only comes from meat that has been cared for in a smoker. Tri tip was also flavorless aside from the liquid smoke aspect.  Don't quite know how you managed to make French fries inedible, but you managed.  The baked beans were literally like bean soup, the broth being straight up runny BBQ sauce.  So I go to my Mac & cheese. Has to be good, right? It's pasta & cheese sauce. Unfortunately it was just...weird tasting. Almost like a gravy with some cheese added. Unexplainably sweet, in some very uncomfortable ways.   I was so hungry when we arrived at this restaurant. So hungry that I regrettably ingested my head cheese-like brisket. I won't be going here again, It was more of a learning experience. There seems to be one hell of a following for this place, but I just don't get it.  If you've actually had real Texas BBQ & know how amazingly delectable it can be, skip this place."}
{"text":"Ribs are the bomb! Seasoning on point and they passed the fall of the bone test!!  Service was fast & EXCELLENT!  The owner was there and saw that my  hands were full and helped me carry the food to the car ;). Awesome service!   Try the cream corn; it's baked, not fried and still delicious"}
{"text":"The first few times we went here we were super excited because every thing was delicious. Unfortunately, the flavor of the food keeps changing and not for the better. Not sure we will be back again at this point. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"About once every 3 weeks a Vet and I come here.  We always get half a rib rack and a pound of tri-tip . Then we stuff ourselves and get a to-go box. The ribs are delicious.  The tri-tip is the most tender I have ever had, without question, it just melts in your mouth.  And the baked beans are to die for.  My Vet calls me every week asking 'are we going this week'.  Love it."}
{"text":"Been hitting up Las Vegas metro BBQ stands that have been on my to-do list, and Big B's was next in line as they are close by and not in the mood to cook that particular evening.  A really nice brisket. More smoke flavor to it vs. Road Kill Grill, which I had a few days earlier. But, the brisket at B's was a little bit drier. Nothing terrible.  Coleslaw was on point. Very good, nothing extra ordinary. Beans were the highlight. Maybe a little too sweet, but outstanding. Fries appear to be hand cut, but were on the limp side and a little bit greasy.  Food was delivered to the table is short order. Friendly staff.  Did not try any of the sauces as a good brisket does not need the sauce.  Downer: no bread slice(s).  Will be back to try other meats."}
{"text":"I forgot to post this last time I was here: Delicious! The meat is amazing!!! I had the turkey last time and this round I went with the tri-tip."}
{"text":"Terrible. $14.00 lunch for this crap? Cashier bored, no skills at all..grocery store Tabatio sauce on table...\"BBQ sauce\" on table unlabeled....fuck this place, terrible service, Back to Lucilles for good BBQ and service...and love the the $1.50 upgrade charge for brisket and $2.75 charge for soda...predict you will be out of business in a month"}
{"text":"Big B's Texas BBQ for lunch today & I think I found my new favorite BBQ place!! It's in Henderson too! On Saint rose close to eastern behind the Canes. Smelled great right front the parking lot and the place was packed. I see why. I had the brisket with 2 sides. Everything was delicious. The bbq baked beans are a must!"}
{"text":"The decor was nice and you could tell the owners put in a lot of work but the food just wasnt up to the standards of some of the other bbq joints around. They also have a nice soda machine."}
{"text":"Tonight we brought 14 teenage boys in from the basketball team for dinner.  They all ordered either the chicken, pulled pork or brisket. most of them had the macaroni & cheese for a side. Everyone of the boys came up and thanked us for the meal and said they wanted to bring their parents back to eat.  Thank you to  Brian and Natalia for the AMAZING service. Your staff went above and beyond for our group tonight.  Looking forward to our next meal at the best BBQ in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was alright... I wouldn't say I would go back, not saying I wouldn't.  My husband had the tri-tip and ribs combo with Mac and cheese and corn on cob for the sides. I had corn on cob, fried okra, corn bread, and Mac and cheese.  Neither of us liked the mac and cheese and ended up throwing it in the trash. It was over cooked macaroni with too much sauce. The corn had absolutely no flavor, even after adding butter and salt! The corn bread was served room temp to almost cold, normally I would expect it to be at least warm.  Staff was very friendly and husband did enjoy the tri-tip. The atmosphere is very clean and nice for its guests. So overall, it's average and I am undecided."}
{"text":"This place is great for BBQ! They have a great vibe inside, it looks like a backyard but only inside. Came here to celebrate a birthday and I was surprised how much space there is for seating. The staff is super nice and helped us with such a large party and made sure we were all taken care of.  As far as food, I tried the 1 meat plate (brisket \"moist\") you can request lean (has less fat) and this plate comes with 2 sides. I was very happy with bbq beans and mac n' cheese. Oh they also give you bread as well.  My yelp check in got me a free side so I ordered fried okra and it was good! Portions of the sides are decent and I'll definitely be back to try the smoked turkey and possibly their sausage links. Ask for their spicier bbq sauce which they give you on the side if you like heat.  Price wise it's about $10-12 for the 1 meat plate without a drink which isn't too bad considering the portions. I was able to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"First time here, we were a little confused where to order but a really friendly guy helped us out. Order first then go to the end of the counter to pay at the registers.  I got the pulled pork po'boy with Mac n cheese and beans. Plus you get a free small side with check in (can't be part of your regular order) so I got the creamed corn.   Pulled pork - absolutely delicious and flavorful  Bun - not worth it, totally soggy. Just get the meat instead. BBQ sauce - only one choice on the table but luckily it was good, slightly sweet, not very thick Mac n cheese - great flavor but could have been warmer Beans - not my favorite (as my very polite niece would say) The beans were undercooked, weird sweet flavor and a ton of stuff in there, not all identified. Creamed corn - so good! If you like corn, you'll love it. If you don't like corn then don't order corn for pete's sake!  My husband said the rib meat was falling off the bone and very good. I tried the sausage and it was very dense, interesting texture and a little too spicy for me.   Overall, great BBQ and lots of seating, TV's everywhere. Next time I want to add on corn bread for $1.50."}
{"text":"Not my favorite BBQ but it was good. As for it being Texas BBQ it was close, but no cigar.  The service was great as we were greeted by the owner.  My most favorite item we got to sample was the trick-tip.  I highly recommend it.  We ordered it along with spare ribs and brisket.  They will offer samples if it's your first time there.  We also tasted the smoked turkey which was also very tasty.  Not sure if I would go back, being that there many other BBQ places to choose from in Vegas.  But then again Im not from Texas.  However I have visited and had some BBQ that has left me craving to go back."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and informative, my first visit about 3-4 mins drive off the 15. Worth the detour, everything smells delicious and looks fabulous. Packed on Friday Lunch, ran out of corn bread . The bbq ribs are juicy with an amazing smokiness and just the right amount of crispy crust. Brisket is so tender and juicy, I love it. The baked beans are so rich and delicious, I can not get them into my mouth fast enough.i would stop in for bake beans alone. Too good to pass up. It will be on my list to must stop on every Vegas trip going forward.only 5, because that is as high as it goes. Excellent BBQ"}
{"text":"I don't have any pictures to add to my review.  We get this for lunch sometimes it's close to the office. I like he slider combo.  You get three sliders and two sides for like 10 bucks.  It will fill you up and curb a bbq craving.  Is it a blow your mind experience no.... but it's bbq and always seem consistent."}
{"text":"Deceptive...  Looks like a crappy strip mall joint from outside...but when you walk in and smell the bbq, see the brick and hear the country music...we'll, it's a slice of Texas here in Nevada.   Oh yeah...the bbq is good too!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great place for BBQ.  Even better that it's close to home!  Great service and the owner was wonderful as well and is very personable!  The meats were cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious!  Will be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, always fast, never a line, and it's a good price. Went twice in one week because it was so amazing"}
{"text":"First time last night. It was busy. You can tell the staff was not used to big crowds. They have been only open for a month, so that should get better over time. The bio online says \"meat served with generous portions of bread\" no one ordering around me had any bread on their tray. I think the meat on top a piece of bread would look more appealing then just dumping meat on a paper lined tray. The menu said baked potato as a side, but we were told they aren't serving them anymore and they'll be taken off the menu ( why not mark it off the menu instead of explaining that every time someone asks). The meats we ordered (brisket, pulled pork, and chicken) were delicious. We only had Mac and cheese and fries, so I do not know about the other sides. They were decent portions and also good. I liked how they had a regular bbq sauce and also a spicy mustard base one! The soda machine was out of all diet drinks. Maybe someone should have told the owner who was walking around talking to the guests. He didn't come by mine or I would have told him. I'd go back again and try some different meats and sides. Maybe they'll be a little more organized."}
{"text":"The food is a 4, the people are a 6... Wife was in for surgery at the hospital next door and I was starved and needed to do some comfort-food stress eating.  The place is huge, kind of country dive cool. Country music blaring...I would have preferred old school R&B or funk, but they were going for a redneck vibe.  As I walked in, everyone turns and greeted me...nice. I ordered a 3-item plate, chicken, brisket and links with Mac and Cheese and Cole Slaw...plus an ice cold beer.  Food came fast, couple people walked over to check on me throughout the meal to make sure all was good. It was great. Brisket was so tender that it could be cut with a fork, Chicken and Links were spot on. Mac and Cheese was ordinary and Cole Slaw was exceptional.  Great job folks! I'll be back.  (...and the wife is fine.)"}
{"text":"We had heard a lot of good things about this place both about the cleanliness and atmosphere to the large portions sizes and quality of food. People are right about the size of the place, it's huge. It's got a fun atmosphere and decent customer service. However the food is comparable to dickies at best and at twice the price. I'm not sure how they have generous portion sizes when you order things by the half pound. The chicken was dry and the ribs were even drier. The sauce was ok, but i didn't like that I NEEDED the sauce to enjoy the food. They were out of Mac n cheese (which they told us after we had paid). The corn bread was stale and the pasta salad had a funny taste. We love Lucile's and prefer the other new place in town belles BBQ. This place is meh at best."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Ordered on yelp and was here in no time!!!! Will definitely eat here more often. I come from Mississippi so it's hard to beat good home cooking out here. I highly recommend this place if u love great bbq"}
{"text":"BBQ turkey .... Out of this world.... I needed a wheel barrow and 2 doggie bags to leave the place!  Great service, friendly atmosphere, and authentic TX wood for the bbq...  I will be returning regularly to explore their entire menu.  My mouth is watering already!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, Country Music, Beer and Picnic Tables.  Super friendly, great service and the owner walking around chatting with customers!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try Big B's BBQ.   I'm from Texas, so I'm familiar with BBQ at its best.   This isn't it.   On the evening we stopped by, Sunday @ 6:00 pm, was told they didn't have anything but ribs and a few hot links.  Against my better judgement we decided to give the ribs a try anyway.   Ordered Cole slaw, out, cornbread, out, Mac and cheese and beans.   Almost went through the floor when the cashier said that'll be $48.21.   Had no beer, and can only be glad they had no slaw or cornbread as the bill would have been over $60.  We split a rack of ribs, $26.   The sides were $7 each for a pint.  Ribs had been rushed, dry and undercooked.  Limited sauce, no spicy BBQ sauce??   First and last trip there.  Way too many other, better, more reasonable options here in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were in the area to check out another new bbq spot that ended up not being open so we stopped by here.  Boy did we luck out.  We ordered the 3 meat plate with brisket, 1/2 slab of ribs and pulled pork.  I wanted hot links but they weren't ready yet.  The plate comes with 2 sides, we chose mac n cheese, baked beans and added a side of coleslaw.  Meat was cooked perfect.  Brisket was moist and tender.  Ribs and pulled pork were excellent.  They have 2 housemade bbq sauces.  One is mustard based and the other ketchup based.  Both have great flavor.  We loved all the sides.  Especially the mac n cheese.  They use 4 cheeses and smoke it for an hour.  It was to die for.  So good that at the end of our meal when we overheard the hot links were ready we got a hot link and more mac and cheese to take home for later.  They have a coke freestyle machine and iced tea, soon they will have sweet tea.  It was early on opening day and there were a few kinks, POS was down, cash only, only partial menu was available but no biggie.  All that will work itself out.  Service was great.  Everyone was very friendly.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just opened today and what can i say food was hot and ready the meats all look great i had the Brisket, Tri tip, mac n cheese, baked beans, and cream corn. Great looking place of course its new but i can tell you 1000 percent better BBQ then anything else in the area. Great job today guys cant wait to make this my new BBQ spot."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. Food is great! Best BBQ beans and oh, their corn bread is amazing! Everything was delicious but I really loved the atmosphere and customer service!   Crew is very attentive and friendly! Went last week some friends 4 adults and 8 kids. Kids love the communal dining setting and we're having a great time. So much that they were probably a bit louder than they should have been. Gentleman came over and offered them ice cream if they'd settle down- on the house! That small gesture meant the world to kids  (and parents) what a kind gesture with dual purpose lol. Anyway , we will def be coming back. Place is always clean and that's a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Used them for catering a Super Bowl party... best play of the day! Two days before the game we ordered Tri tip, Brisket and Pulled Pork along with Baked Beans and Mac & Cheese.  It was ready for pick up when they said it would be, and everything was hot and delicious. Our guests LOVED everything! I'm sure they will have at least 20 new customers.  If you are looking for authentic Texas BBQ, this is the place. Friendly service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"First time in the place. Very clean and great staff. However the food was disgusting. I just left there 20 minutes ago. Ribs were as dry as could be. The mac n cheese was the worst I have ever had in my life. They tasted and smelled burnt. I couldn't even finish the bite I took. Had to spit it right out. Husbands brisket was plain and definitely not much to it at all. Beans were on the runny side but not bad. Pasta salad was the only thing I personally enjoyed."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas! You will never leave this place hungry because the portions are huge. Brisket melts in your mouth and the pulled pork was amazing. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and an amazingly kind staff. I was stuck waiting for a family member to come out of the hospital and without going into too much detail I will just say that the head guy at Texas BBQ was extraordinarily kind and compassionate, and really put a smile on my face. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue! Pulled pork is absolutely great with just the right amount of smoke. The brisket was tender and perfect. This is the real deal people! The Mac and cheese was great as well. Grab a beer and some cue chill out and enjoy it the way it should be. So far this is the best BBQ place in Vegas/Henderson."}
{"text":"For a place that claims to be \"Texas BBQ,\" the brisket was overdone and seriously lacked seasoning (and smokiness).   On the other hand, the turkey and tri-tip were seasoned properly, but were on the over smoked side. The first few bites were good, but then the ash tray like flavor one gets from wood that's smoldering and not completely ablaze set in. Overwhelming and unappetizing.   Sausage was snappy and spicy. Easily the best part of the meal.   Mac and cheese: super cheesy and quite tasty. Beans: ultra sweet and gummy. Potato salad: dry with store bought like flavors.   On the plus side, they serve sweet tea and all the employees were very friendly.   Even though it's close to my house, I'd rather drive the extra 30 minutes to Rollin' Smoke and get considerably better barbecue.  ***UPDATE***  Someone from Big B's responded to my review. Since I can't directly respond, I'll do so here:  I'm not suggesting that you undercook your meat. I'm not really suggesting that you do anything. If you want your meat to taste the way it does and that is your taste, so be it. I know the difference between meat smoked with wood that's completely combusting and wood that's just smoldering. Yours tastes like the latter. The first few bites are good, but then it starts to get strong and overwhelming.   Simple seasoning does not equal little taste. I tasted no salt or pepper or anything on the brisket. It wasn't bad, just lacked flavor.  Also, the turkey obviously at least had salt on it or it was brined (and there is nothing wrong with brining anything).   I don't think that you bought anything from the store, just that it sort of has a store bought taste. My main issue with the potato salad was that it was dry.   I, by no means, am trying to tell you guys how to do anything. I've eaten good barbecue all over this country, barbecue at home for myself, and have become spoiled with what I think is good. No offense meant at all. Obviously, you guys have a huge following and an overall great score on Yelp. Just here to give my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best!!!!!  Had the brisket combo.  It fell apart!  Ordered the desert!  The biggest!  You better be hungry when you eat there.  Customer service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Authentic Texas BBQ. First class owners in Brian and Natalia that take great pride in their quality of food."}
{"text":"Great food, reminds me of the Barbecue places in Texas. Prices are reasonable and the staff are nice. If you're looking for something more authentic and different than all the chain barbecue places around town you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind Raising Cane's, the Las Vegas Weekly write-up piqued my interest to finally try this place. We came in shortly after 11 am for lunch, which is early. I ordered a two-meat plate, and my boyfriend ordered a 1-meat plate. We each got a fountain drink. Lunch with tip came out to over $30 (which was kind of steep for the quantity/quality we got).  I ordered pulled pork and chicken, with mac and cheese and fries. We had a bit of a wait for the french fries because the fryer hadn't heated up enough yet, but when they dropped on the table, they were so worth it - very tasty. The mac had a texture and tasted like it had been reheated, so I was disappointed in that. The pulled pork was good, but the chicken was a little flavorless.  My boyfriend got the tri tips, cole slaw and beans, all of which he said were okay. Not the best he'd ever had, but good. The portion size on the tri tips was a little small, especially in comparison to my pork and gigantic chicken.  The space has a ton of picnic tables that are very cute, and had community dining in mind. We were one of multiple one- and two-person dining parties. The restaurant could benefit from putting in a few two-person tables so they don't have a single person taking up a four-person table when it gets busy (because some people just don't like to sit down with folks they don't know.)"}
{"text":"Best bbq around! Tri tip and pulled pork are outstanding. Large portions and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Came here right when they opened at 11am on Sunday. They were ready to go. Very friendly staff, well designed, comfortably lit dining area.   Food is ordered at counter and then brought to your table. Food is served on trays with paper, disposable silverware and cups.  Tried almost all the meats besides the ribs and salmon. Sliced tri tip was great, chicken leg quarter and turkey were moist, brisket tender and moist, hot link was a normal hot link, pulled pork was better than most places.   Fried okra was fresh, very well seasoned, super good. Mac and cheese is more white in color, smooth, creamy, with no processed cheese flavors. White or wheat bread came with our plates also.  The two sauces offered were unique but good. One was tomato based, one mustard, both were on the sweeter side.  No complaints. We'll be back to try the ribs!"}
{"text":"Great Barbeque! I tasted it for the first time this past Tuesday for a political function. I took a plate home! The beef tips, hotlinks, potatoes salad, coleslaw, and the beans were yummy! I will recommend your restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. I'm from San Antonio so whenever I come here it makes me just feel at home. Great food , great place ! The only knock I have is they should do like a punch card or some short of reward system because I eat here quite a bit."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this venue and was pleasantly surprised to find this amazing little restaurant tucked away behind St Rose hospital. So very cute inside and all the employees are eager and pleasant. The food is TOP NOTCH. We ordered the 2 meat plates with pulled pork, tri-tip and a rack of ribs. Everything was amazing even the sides.   I would definitely come here again. Venue is good for large dinner parties as well."}
{"text":"First time to Big B's and cant wait to return.Everything we ate was really good and fresh.Oh did i mention homemade too! Had a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and beans.Well the beans have brisket in them to boot....yum!Potato salad was tasty cold and sides are plentiful. The wife had the Brisket sandwich and fries and coleslaw.I tasted hers and ....well yum!! Two different sauces on the table so you can choose your flavor.Comfortable casual atmosphere. Gonna try homemade desserts next time."}
{"text":"After living in Texas for almost 10 years, I got spoiled on Great BBQ. After moving to Las Vegas and searching for a good BBQ place I thought I would have to go back to Texas for good Beef ribs and Brisket. Them this place opened. Not only is the food great,  the staff and owner are very friendly.  The place is not as busy as it should be. This place is worth every dollar spent"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at big b's, the food is good and they give good portions. not the best bbq in town but you don't have to wait for a table. just walk up and order so its convenient."}
{"text":"If I could have given less than one star I would have. This had to be the worse food I have ever had. Had takeout of ribs, chicken, smoked turkey & tri-tip. Had sides of mac & cheese, barbecue beans, potato salad & cole slaw, as well as supposed corn bread.  All the meat was overcooked & dry & wasn't even palatable. The cornbread were little muffins that tasted like they forgot to use cornmeal to make them. The mac & cheese was old & dry, the bbg beans detestable. The only items we could even eat were the potato salad & cole slaw. I don't know what they're doing at Big B's, but they're doing it all wrong."}
{"text":"Located on St Rose Pkwy in the same plaza as Raising Caines and Tommy's. I had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at pictures. However, we were sadly disappointed.   Let's start with the good:  1. The employees were super friendly and gladly took the time to explain the menu.  2. The facility was clean and there were plenty of places to sit.  3. All of our side dishes were delicious. We ordered the potato salad, slaw, fries and fried okra. The potato salad was flavorful and the slaw had the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. The fries and okra are fried fresh with each order so they were super hot and crispy. It was the saving grace to our meal.  4. Beef links had a decent amount of heat and a good bite to the skin.  5. The ribs had a good smokey flavor.   Now the bad.  1. The ribs and brisket were dry. Like I mean dry! Right when we sat down to eat, we could already see it. You can see in my picture how dry the ribs are if you think I'm exaggerating. The fact that we had to submerge it in BBQ sauce just shows how dry it was. We came here to get good meat, but that didn't happen.   The highlight of a BBQ place should be the meat, not the sides. And that's exactly what happened here. We left still craving that BBQ experience. I guess we still have to keep searching for a decent spot."}
{"text":"Barbecue so good it doesn't need sauce. Mac n cheese was super creamy and delicious. Brisket was moist and tender, pulled pork had some nice caramelized bits in it. Poor boy bread was soft and flavorful. Fried Okra and home style French cut fries made fresh when ordered. Had a great dining experience. We ate like royalty for under $20. Ribs are smoking good!!!! #WeWillBeBack ;)"}
{"text":"Located in same parking lot as Canes and Tommy's. From St Rose Siena hospital, you can walk to Big B's. I really enjoyed the decor of this restaurant. Casual but well decorated. A gentleman assisted us to place our order since it was our first time. Guys if you Check-in on yelp, they will offer you a side with your meal (most likely they give you an extra side since their price are set as a menu) We ordered 3 meat plate with 2 sides, Hot link sausage (spicy spicy), brisket (juicy and tender YUM) and some ribs  (+ $5) I expected something more juicy with BBQ sauce  My sides were fries and BBQ beans. Hubby ordered Po Boy with tri-tip (+$1.5) with pasta salad and macaroni & cheese. Po Boy sandwich was little dry... no sauce just bread and meat. He had the souvenir of the Po Boy we had in New Orleans, he was disappointed that it wasn't the same  Honestly I Love meat but if you go for 3 meats plate think of sharing it  I couldn't finished it!  the seating area is like a covered patio with the benches, very nice! Employees were friendly and helpful. I won't eat it everyday but great place if you are craving BBQ meat  They do Monday Football night :) While I was enjoying my order, I was thinking that the restaurant could be a Great Place for a wedding! Catering on site, plenty of parking spaces and the restaurant could accommodate 175 people!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. If you are an avid weekend bbq/smoker person you'll appreciate the food that this place puts out. Not too bad on price, fairly comparable to other BBQ joints out there but always nice to go to a small business and support. Service is nice as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ this side of the Mississippi.  Clean, friendly, the Ribs were PURRFECT.  As was the Trip Tip and Brisket.  Sides were great too, but the corn could be a little creamier.  This is definitely a once a month visit."}
{"text":"Freakin awesome place!! Love the picnic tables inside and set up! Warm awesome place for families to dine in! All TEXAS!! Country music over the PA. Food was amazing!! Huge portions!! They have a ginormous sandwich!! Dare to finish it! Staff is warm and friendly! Management came to personally check on us and thank us. We'll be coming more often! Kinda tucked in on St. Rose so watch for it !"}
{"text":"easily the best BBQ in vegas! Staff is amazing! Showed up 20 minutes before they closed and didn't want to be that asshole but they were totally cool and it worked out in my favor cause they gave me the last of mac n cheese WHICH IS AMAZING. The Tri tip and brisket are perfect and smoked to perfection. Pulled pork too...basically just get everything! Will be back for sure! Thanks guys! Stoked to have proper BBQ here!"}
{"text":"Brisket the most tender I have ever tasted! So tender it was mushy. The meat itself desperately lacked seasoning especially salt. The meat was rather lean as well, suggesting it had been trimmed too much. The bark on the brisket had no crunch and even less flavor. However, on the positive this may be perfect food to serve to a new born baby.   Baby back ribs again lacked crunch or bark the bones fell out of them because they were way over cooked. The the meat tasted slight on the dry side however they were seasoned better than brisket.. I think they sat in Alto Shaam a bit too long.  The food came out insanely fast.   It would be much better if they had warmed them quickly in oven and blasted them with a salamander to firm the crust of ribs.  With anything if u slop enough bbq sauce on it, it will be good enough. I happened to think their sauce wasn't bad.  Wasn't great either.   Sides Coleslaw lacked vinegar and seasoning. Standard Coleslaw for the peons. Easy fix..  Potato Salad which I didn't order but came instead of my coleslaw which they let me keep needed much more fat. Was overall dry.. the potatoes should have been cooked more delicately in better seasoned water. I would guess the potatoes are thrown into  boiling water hence so dry. the bell peppers inside is a good move.  More fat and more acid would also help. Fried okra had too much batter which made it difficult to taste the vegetable underneath.  Last scary to see iodized salt on tables, really for 27.00 for a beer and 2 meat plate you serve me ionized salt.. very insulting   THE restaurant looks great and they definitely spent some cash making it look good. Whoever is marketing this place is killing it.. I hope you improve your food so less people are tricked by your great marketing..  While this place deserves 1 star I could tell they are trying. The pregnant cashier lady was very friendly. There is some potential."}
{"text":"Everything's good! Delicious pasta salad mmmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"2 items ribs and tri-tip with fries and Mac and cheese for sides. Loved it as usual. The staff here is awesome, always so nice and friendly. Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that we chose this place for Friday night dinner. I thought it was going to be just as crowded as any other restaurant on Friday but I thought wrong. The staff is extremely nice as well. Since it was my first time eating here, I got baby back ribs along with two choices of sides. Those choices I chose were creamed corn and corn bread. The food made me and my taste buds really satisfied. The bathrooms are really nice as well. What really caught my eye was that there were park benches instead of booths or tables. I thought that was really creative and help set the country-like mood. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good brisket. We just moved here from little rock and the brisket over there is super dry. I tried brisket in Dallas once and that was like heavenly delicious. Thick cut and juicy. This place has brisket that's kind of close to the Dallas type but still not as juicy. Ribs were very good. The corn on the cob was the only thing that wasn't good. It was dry and bland and the corn tasted old. We got take out (ordered and paid on Yelp) and it was nice. I didn't have to wait much."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in Las Vegas.  Perhaps the best I've ever had and I travel a lot in search of awesome food.  It's was mouth watering in every way.  We ordered delivery and the delivery service driver said it was her first time picking up at Big B's Texas BBQ and it smelled delicious. She was going back there on her break to try it. I can't wait to have more.  We ordered two three meat plates with two sides each so we could try a variety. Everything from the turkey to the brisket was amazing. The French fries were out of this world old school good and the mac & cheese and sweet corn left me wanting more. Next time I'm going to go to the restaurant so that I can experience it where it was prepared and meant to be served.  If you're dreaming of BBQ in Las Vegas your dreams have come true."}
{"text":"Great for parties or big groups. Excellent barbecue. I got the chicken and baby back ribs. Fantastic. They have a decent assortment of beers and sodas for the kids. Superclean and great service."}
{"text":"The quintessential method for determining barbecue worthiness is the brisket the place kicks out. Based solely on the quality of its brisket, this place deserves a solid 5 star. The brisket is that good! Other factors, however, contributed to a lower score.  The potato salad was too mustardy and had potato chunks that were way too large. The chunks should be cut in half or smashed up a little bit better, and the ratio of mustard should be diminished. Nothing worse than too much mustard in the potato salad.  The baked beans were horrendous. Too many different varieties of beans with chunks of meat thrown in. Totally misses the point of baked beans.   Hotlinks actually were delicious also, so at least this place does a really good job in its meat. It's the other issues that are not quite up to par.  I'll definitely be back for brisket and other meats, but next time I'll try different sides.  EDIT: Reduced rating to a 3 star rating as that is more in line with my general approach to rating restaurants. This place is not a 4-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure to try the beef ribs here and they were legit! Very comparable to Phil's BBQ in San Diego. The standard sauce is amazing and the spicy sauce is delicious also!    IMO, it is better than Lucille's and Tucky's, though at Tucky's they don't serve beef ribs.   I look forward to coming back and trying the brisket and tri-tip.  Hope this interview helps you out! Enjoy! I know I did and will do in the near future."}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and gave this place a try. Walked in with the family no one greeted us for about 3 mins there wasn't many people in there everyone was staring at us lol Finally I found a waitress and asked do we just seat ourselves and she said no you have to order up front. Neways food was average meat was super dry from the ribs to the turkey I took off one star for that and another for the service."}
{"text":"For those who have never had Texas style BBQ this is the best spot for it west of Texas itself. The pulled pork and tri-tip were excellent and I can't wait to come back and try some of the other items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in Vegas and reminds me of living in Texas. The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. Everything on the menu is good and I love the fact that it's so close to my house. I tell all my friends to come here."}
{"text":"The Beef Ribs were awesome ... We split 1/2 rack baby back ribs and sides were  Backed Beans ....,Very good !!  Mac n Cheese ( good but a little to creamy) Fried Okra was good ( homemade is better)  lots of comfortable seating great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Got a little bit Texas reckless with the homie at Big B's.   Confession: I don't love Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese has disappointed me time and time again, and I've disgraced my loved ones and lost friends over my lack of love of Mac and cheese. However, I *love* their #macandcheese literally the best I've ever had.   But you're not reading this for my Mac and cheese review. #bbq is great. Juicy, tender. Everything a #meat eater could want. I recommend the #babybackribs #pulledpork and #hotlinks and #chicken in particular. No shade to the other meats. I haven't left any other bbq place craving #brisket or #turkey  Back to the sides the #fries are UH-MAZING. While I'm eating them I'm literally thinking, \"Mom would love these fries.\" (editor's note: mom can be picky when it comes to fry praise) fries are a must. And the #coleslaw is a standout. Creamy without being super mayo-y. Last standout, the #cornbread is basically dessert. It's got cinnamon or brown sugar or something that kicks it up a notch. Makes it stand out amongst other cornbreads. Potato salad was good. And Baked beans were much too sweet for me (and that's me saying that)."}
{"text":"We lived in Austin for five years and had our share of great to fair BBQ. This rates up there with the greats like Franklins and Rudys. We are rather picky, and this place is outstanding.   This is the most authentic Texas experience you will find outside of TX for BBQ. Sit at picnic tables, rolls of paper towels, smells of BBQ smokehouse waft thru air, served on butcher/wax paper and trays. Sweet Tea and Shiner is on tap.   The food is great: Brisket, chicken and ribs and smoked turkey. Sides were really good: BBQ beans, creamed corn. Portions are very big.  Service was excellent. Everyone there was friendly, and very hospitable, including the owner.   Can't wait to see this place continue to thrive."}
{"text":"Oh my god....I can't explain how good the BBQ is, so you're just going to have to try it for yourself. So smokey and delicious! We had the Turkey, pulled pork and tri tip with fried okra, BBQ beans, potato salad and corn bread. I have no regrets about how full I am right now."}
{"text":"I've fallen in love with this food over and over again. As a matter of fact, it's every single time I'm surprised at how perfectly balanced the mesquite roasted meats and sides! Best BBQ West of Texas highly recommend for dine in, take out or catering I've had it all!"}
{"text":"Pro's: Atmosphere, price, service, portion are great.  Con's: arrived literally 2 hrs after they just opened. All sides and meats With the exception of Tri-tip and Beef Ribs; dry, room temp and lacked seasoning for my personal preference.  Keep in mind everyone's taste when it comes to Bbq vary...this was based on my personal preference."}
{"text":"When you walk into a place and the smell alone is enough to make your nipples hard, you know it's 5 star worthy.   Set up like a classic Texas BBQ spot with picnic tables, paper towels on the table, and a open kitchen concept this place instantly puts you at comfort. The staff here are insanely helpful and for Big B Texas BBQ virgins they really make you feel comfortable and ready for the tasty meats about to penetrate your tastebuds and your soul.   I went with the brisket plate with mac n' cheese and BBQ beans, my dinner buddy went with the Tri-Tip plate with the same sides, but added cornbread. Ya'll don't even get me started, but this was some of the best smoked meat I've had in a long time. Both the brisket and Tri-tip were criminally moist and flavorful, literally melt in your mouth amazing. I liked the tri-tip better than my brisket, but they both reigned supreme in flavorville. (Flavor Town is trademarked)  The mac n' cheese... amazing! I could eat an entire vat of this stuff and the BBQ Beans were sweet, salty, and the perfect side dish for all the meats I was enjoying. The BBQ sauces offered here are all house made and I really recommend the mustard based sauce, a mix of sweet/sour and not overly \"stard\" tasting. The ketchup based sauce is sweet and compliments the tri-tip and brisket perfectly. They do offer a Habanero/Ghost Pepper sauce that is out of this world good and is surprisingly not too hot, just a delightful flavor bomb. I might have taken some home with me for my eggs, pop-tarts and pretty much anything within an arm's reach.   Are you a BBQ seeker? Stop everything, your search had ended."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas on Vacation from Texas so decided to give this place a shot. 1st i'd like to say i'm comparing this place to the BBQ served in Texas. After all the name has Texas in it so you'd of thought it would be Good! The tip off that it wouldn't be up to par w Texas was all the decor, typically if your restaurant is #1 in a strip center & #2 has cow skulls & other decor the quality probably isn't there. The staff was helpful & courteous in our ordering process explaining the menu and our options.  Let's start w the brisket, lets just say we couldn't even finish it & what we did eat we had to drown in sauce. The brisket lacked a smoke flavor yet the restaurant was pilled full of wood which is another tip its not very good. The Pork ribs had very little smoke flavor but were decent. The jalapeno cheese sausage i'd describe as being a little like jerky. The side of cream corn seemed to be missing the corn, looked like all it had was the pieces of husk's and no kernels. The corn bread had way to much cinnamon and tasted like a muffin you'd make around the holidays!   I'd encourage the owner to possibly visit Austin & Houston and check out some of the Texas Monthly TOP 50 joints to see what true Texas BBQ is like. With all that said i don't think it was terrible for Vegas, if you've heard of Dickies BBQ i'd say that is slightly below that. its just being from Texas i wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"The location and a few of the staff are outstanding in helping out. I got a couple of the 2 meats plates with drinks. The place is very hip. You sign everything on an iPad and when you tip they ring a bell and say something about beers tonight.  The sit in area is very Texas with benches etc. very well done everything.  Now with the food. I love brisket and I couldn't more disappointed. It was way over cooked and chewy. Must've been a bad day for the cooks. I also got the smoked meetloaf and it was smokey and red in the middle. Must've only been smoked to 110 degrees or something. It had good potential, but was gross. The best thing honestly tonight we're the French fries. I'm giving it 2 stars only because the people were beyond nice. I would never recommend this place. Good luck to the rest of you."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Tri-Tip sandwich and the cream corn. The cream corn was really similar to corn pudding and had the perfect amount of spice. The service and atmosphere was top notch while we were there. I would return recommend this restaurant if in the Henderson area or visiting the Hospital next door."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in vegas.   Mac and cheese , fried okra, creamed corn, turkey, brisket, ribs etc etc. etc   Everything is bomb!!  Sweet tea, pie, just go crazy and order everything.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Amazing BBQ! Great friendly staff!"}
{"text":"It was good. Wasn't very busy went I went there for lunch. The benches are kinda cool, the tri-tip was perfect."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Henderson hands down. It might even be the best BBQ in the Las Vegas area. They are newly opened so they are still working some things out. Expect it will take you a little while to go through the line, but it is worth it.   I have been there twice.  Had their pulled pork and brisket. If possible it was even better the second time. Just walking in the place and smelling the amazing BBQ aromas is enough to make you salivate. I have to imagine the rest of the meats are as good as the two I have tried.   The bread they use for the sandwiches is really good. The sides I think are still a work in progress. They make the fries fresh when you order them and they are good. Corn on the cob is good, but the one I got wasn't particularly warm. The Mac and cheese looked great but the noodles were a little over cooked. The baked beans are great. As for the rest of the sides I can't comment, other than they look appetizing.  Staff is really friendly and nice. Dining area is clean and able to support larger groups. Hopefully they will work out the kinks in the sides, but until then the meat is more than worth the visit."}
{"text":"Food 5 Stars; Service 2 Stars. The beef was wonderful! I was a bit surprised when they came out with a tray with some meat and two slices of white bread. I asked where the sides were and she said the fries and okra would come. Fries came, I asked about okra...they said it was coming up.  I completely finished my meal and no okra. So I informed them and asked that I get banana pudding togo in its place. I waited a few minutes...they brought me (only) okra.  After I was finished with my meal, it was too late for okra...it got cold and went in the trash.  It is a 20 min drive from me, if the service had been good, I'd probably go back...but I don't want to drive that far for poor service even if the food is good.  Too many good places to eat in Las Vegas to put up with that. (By the way...they had 4 employees and 3 tables at the time). 13 July about 1120."}
{"text":"This was a delivery order   Very disappointed again when ordered something and you didn't have. I appreciate you replacing with 2. But I didn't ask for it. A call would have been better and I would have just gone without.  2. when I called about utensils I was told we do sometimes but really when a customer asks for it.  3. Take stuff of the menu if you dont have it plz so disappointing to a customer when the expectation has suffered.   But still gave it  a 4 because the food is still yummy."}
{"text":"For those claiming they had the best brisket in their lives, settle down.  The tri tip was pretty good but overall this place is average on TX standards - I guess add 25-30 percent premium bc it's Vegas.  This place is decent - I'm prob more harsh bc if you're gonna have TX BBQ in your name I expect them to back it up"}
{"text":"We have not had brisket this delicious since we lived in Texas. Perfect pink, smokey ring, super moist. I unlocked the free side and it allowed me to try one more delicious side, the creamed corn. All the sides were super delicious, though! Even my picky toddler loved the pulled pork and fried okra! Sweet tea was on point and hubby enjoyed a Not Your Fathers root beer tall boy."}
{"text":"This is Texas BBQ!! I went for my first time and the variety is on point. From the sides like corn on the cob and juicy good BBQ. I would even bring my friends from Texas when visiting town! Must do spot."}
{"text":"Amazing find, thank you for the great food. Walked in here by accident, left satisfied."}
{"text":"HEAVENLY. Have you ever been to the south? My husband and I lived in the south for a few years (Texas and Kentucky) and since being in Vegas have yet to find a good, authentic, genuine bbq place. But alas, WE FOUND IT. Holy cow this food was tasty. The meat was so savory. It literally fell off the bone of the ribs as my husband was picking them up to eat. Perfection. The bbq sauce was the bomb!! The portion sizes were Texas- huge!! (Everything is bigger in Texas!!) at first we thought it was pricey but then we saw how much meat we got and it is TOTALLY WORTH IT. The combos are a steal! And actually quite a deal, seriously, meat is expensive. The staff was so incredibly kind and helpful too. We will be back!!   We had so many left overs that it was lunch and dinner the next day. The meat saved so well and was even better the next day.   Highly highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great looking place. You can smell the barbecue before walking into the restaurant. Cool atmosphere, with several TV's and some good music.  The baby back ribs were fall off the bone awesome with several great choices of sauces to select from.  The owner gave us a sampling of the tri-tip which was also quite tasty.  Nice guy, great place for family and is also kid friendly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I need a nap! That was the best BBQ I've had in years! Ate so much only thing they need is a back room to nap! If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Everything we ordered was delicious but if really want to be wow'd order their beef ribs! Looks like dinosaur bones on our table! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Texas BBQ, they even have Shiner Bock on tap.  Ordered 1/2 slab of ribs with a side of cole slaw.  Both were excellent.  Ribs were falling off the bone, which I have been told means their a little over done, but they were still moist and flavorful.  The very charming host Heather thru in a complimentary mac n cheese when she heard I was on a low carb diet.  She told me I should just take one bite and throw out the rest.  Easier said than done!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome environment!  Must try the Jalape√±o and cheese hot link! my personal favorite"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Vegas my husband and I come from Texas my father is born in Texas and he knows his BBQ . We love this place we always will go to Lucilles BBQ in the district that place is a dump compare to this omg great service and food and also affordable!! Not a fan of the cornbread but everything else amazing"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service is good, & the place is clean! Their sauces are good too! Beef ribs I was not to happy with but everything we got was good.  Especially their brisket!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone there I've had a good experience. The barbecue is delicious and the meats are very moist."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  We live on the other side of town and love good BBQ.  So we didn't care about the drive one bit.  It was so worth it!  The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was inviting and comfortable.  I loved seeing the staff preparing the food as everything is very open to the guests.  I enjoyed the 3 slider meal with 2 sides....the cream corn is AMAZING!  The tri-tip, brisket and pulled pork melted in my mouth.  The french fries were super fresh and not greasy at all.  I am very picky about coleslaw and theirs was spot on.  The really hot sauce was not on the table but I heard another guest ask for it so I had to try it too.  Perfect addition!  Try Big B's Texas BBQ.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating from here: first time was delivery , this time was takeout. I liked the atmosphere when I walked in: clean , welcoming , decor in accord with the food. I fell in love with the smoked turkey so I went with that again. I did the one meat plate with fried okra and mac & cheese. They have a mustard BBQ sauce that goes with this turkey so damn well that I got three sauce containers.   The mac and cheese is good, not my grandmothers , but it's pretty good and the okra was hot and good.   The smoked turkey was, once again, on point and I recommend to everyone. The cornbread was good too.   I might get adventurous next time and try the other meats but I like poultry.   I am officially a repeat customer, thanks Big B'z"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is even more amazing! Friendly, courteous and always in a great mood when we walk in! It's dangerous being so close to my home! See you all soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend with my girlfriend.  I'm not sure how many of you have been to Phil's BBQ in San Diego but the way ordering is, is similar to theirs.  You first walk in, walk up to the counter and order your food, receive a receipt, and proceed to the cash register to order your drink (if wanted) and pay for your meal.  You receive a number and they bring the food out to your table when it's ready.  I ordered the 3 meat combo, and chose chicken, brisket and tri-tip.  It comes with a choice of 2 sides (I chose macaroni and cheese and a corn on the cob) and an additional side (I chose french fries) at no charge if you check-in on Yelp (don't forget!).  My girlfriend had ordered the 1 meat combo, and chose the 1/2 slab of ribs and for her 2 sides she picked a corn on the cob and corn bread.  My meats were all delicious, tender, and flavorful.  I do suggest you use their sauce (looks like bbq sauce) provided on the tables with your meat, it makes it taste 100x better.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious as well.  The rib meat fell off the bones beautifully.  The ribs lack some flavor so I feel that it's mandatory to put the sauce on them.  The cornbread is by far my favorite part of the meal.  Its texture and taste is amazing.    Parking is plentiful so no issue there.  The service is good as well, all of the workers are very friendly and helpful.  Inside seating is spaced out and there's plenty of spots.  The decor is cute.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"ordered some bbq for the fam, chicken was a little undercooked and you guys forgot the rolls, which my daughter was looking forward to. delivery was fast, delivery lady was cool."}
{"text":"This barbecue is exactly how I like it:  so tender the meat falls from the bone!  Mac and cheese was ok.  Beans had a bit too much going on for me.  Cornbread was dry.  The BBQ alone is enough of a seller for me though!  Very sweet owner."}
{"text":"Big B's doin big things here in Vegas.   Solid spot for bbq. The bbq is \"Texas-style\" so they don't sauce up their meats beforehand. They only use salt and pepper for their seasoning so it enhances the flavor a little bit without complicating it too much. We were also informed that the owner personally drives over to Texas to pick up wood for smoking his meats. Talk about dedication.   I loved their brisket, super lean but also really moist and tender. Their hot links were solid along with the spare ribs, beef ribs, and the turkey. We also tried their loaded potato skins, and those were the perfect complement to our meats. Pro tip: If you like spicy sauces, ask for their \"yelp sauce.\" It's like a hot bbq sauce with ghost peppers mixed in, and it's so good with their meats.   Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"Really good ribs, sauce jumps (it is on the sweet side), good casual atmosphere.  BBQ beans were thick and savory, just like central Texas! Employees checked on us twice while we were eating, everyone was friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Visited Big B's BBQ for lunch & we left with happy belly's! I ordered the one meat combo plate & had the ribs (which comes with 6 pieces) & my two sides were Mac n cheese & cream corn. WOW! My ribs fell right off the bone & were juicy, perfect seasoning & didn't even need any sauce! They were amazing. A nice cold beer was the perfect partner to this lunch & the selection they had was really good to choose from. Can't wait to go back for my next Texas style lunch"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! Took my family here to try it when they came in from out of town! Live on the southwest side of town but we will be back!  I would say hands down the best BBQ place I've been to in Las Vegas. To top it off, service was fantastic as well! We will make this place a standard stop!"}
{"text":"Been living in vegas almost 9 years.... finally just tried this place a week ago with my wife. Been here 3 times now. Love this place. Brisket tri tip and baby back ribs are probably the best I've ever had. All the side are awesome as well. Tried the meatloaf today and have to say I'm not a fan. But I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. We are customers for life!!"}
{"text":"I tavel and eat out a lot. When I come across a great find I love to share. A must for me everytime im in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Had taken a trip to Texas & tried a place called \"Rudy's\". Man oh man, did they have the best moist brisket that I've ever tasted. So being that we didn't have anything close to a place like that here, this place was a MUST TRY when we heard about it.  Me and my family (of 5) went there for lunch today. Heard from a friend that their moist brisket was similar to Rudy's, we just had to order more than enough so we would have leftovers. Yes, it is MOIST & tender and oh-so-good! The beef ribs were meh. I saw the beef ribs were individually wrapped with plastic wrap and they looked cold. Seems like they put them on the grill to warm through so I was not impressed with that. Is that how Bbq joints do them? It did definitely have that smoked flavor I did like though. The creamed corn was okay. Guess because I was expecting it to be similar to Rudy's too but it wasn't even close. It was a little on the salty side too. The fried okra & fries were delicious and I really liked the Bbq sauce!  Sorry but I had to deduct the 1 star for the beef ribs but Overall this is a GREAT Bbq place. Love the setup of the restaurant, staff was very friendly, and the food was really good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find an authentic Texas BBQ in Vegas/Henderson, but found the service marginal and the food mediocre at best. Everything was way too smokey, the chicken (dark meat only btw) was super dry, the brisket was tough as leather. I threw away a pound of brisket because it wasn't edible. The best meat was the pulled pork, which I enjoyed. BBQ sauce was solid. Overall super disappointing that a place claiming to be Texas BBQ can't get the basics right."}
{"text":"Big B's Texas BBQ is the place to go for some great barbecue selections. I am not big into meat, myself, so I opted for the side choices. The corn on the cob was good, The smoked mac & cheese was great, and the cream/cheesy corn was phenomenal. If you're in the Henderson area you should check it out, if you're anywhere else it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Last year I had Big Bs at 4 stars. I gave them the 5 stars they deserve just now. I just now tried their pulled pork after over 2 years of eating there. That pulled pork w/the Carolina sauce in the GOAT!! And you was right Big B, the jalapeno & cheese links are better than the regular links. Im mad I didnt get that last link just now. See yall next time bro!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic hospitality and fantastic atmosphere. They do a great job of making customers feel welcome and I can safely say this is definitely my favorite barbecue spot. Looking forward to my next meal and also spreading the word of this place. If you've not been, you definitely should!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here not really knowing what to expect and it blew me away. It feels like a good ole smokehouse with picnic benches. I bought the meat plate chicken , Sausage, ribs and the wife got the brisket. The service and food was great. I was a little disappointed with the BBQ sauce selection as I could only find one bottle on my table and like it more spicy but the meat was cooked perfectly.Great food, great service and great prices for BBQ I will be back!"}
{"text":"I got a 3 meat plate, the ribs weren't bad, the pork was dry, but the brisket is what will bring me back. I have never had such flavorful melt in your mouth brisket before!"}
{"text":"Best Place to eat for any families with Dairy and Egg allergies. My daughter was so excited!  shes never tried corn bread,  she ate 3 muffins!! and 4 rolls.  The owner is amazing he took the time read ingredients and verify what foods she was able to eat. BBQ was amazing.  Come eat here!!"}
{"text":"WOW!  I never jump on Yelp immediately after a meal...but I must now! Hub and I get coupons in the mail and we kept putting it off and putting it off. I grew up in the south.  I cannot remember when I have had great BBQ since I left... Until today...holy Toledo!!!! We decided to get it to go, because we wanted to sit outside on our patio on such a beautiful day and pop open some nice cold beers. When we arrived just before 5 pm there were not a lot of people there...but we eat early so this was no concern. The smell hits you at the door...woo...this smells good. We ordered 1/2 lb brisket lean and pulled pork sandwich as offered on the coupon... got Mac and cheese and some corn bread. Brought it home and opened the beer...fork tender brisket with a nice sauce, not too sweet.. The way I like it. I think tears dang near ran down hub and my eyes....we have FINALLY found a great BBQ place in Las Vegas!! Please GO!  Keep this place here forever and ever!  Forgot to take pictures, but other reviews you can see what you are getting! Thanks Texas BBQ...you now have customers for life!!!"}
{"text":"Good choices and vintage Texas style bbq. They have plenty of options at brisket, chicken, beef & pork ribs. The staff was wonderful. The owner saw that my beef ribs were less meaty and offered a free extra rib.   The sides were delicious as I had the bbq beans, Mac & cheese, and Cole slaw.   I really liked the links, as they were a mildly spicy cheddar link that perfectly cooked and wonderful.   I liked the decor and ambiance as well. Everything was properly appointed and nicely decorated.  I will definitely be returning to this spot."}
{"text":"I really like this place!! Love the friendly people and the place is pretty big and spacious. They let us taste the a few of the meats which was great.    Our order was tri tip, chicken BBQ, pulled pork, brisket, cornbread, fries, mac and cheese and cream of corn. All our food was delish. The meat and chicken was tender and juicy. The mac and cheese was really good. Cornbread I think I could pass on that. Cream of corn ice actually had better. But he main food at this BBQ place is the meat not the side. The BBQ meat makes this place and the I recommend it. Even without the house sauce it still great. But why not add it. It's on every table. They also have another hot sauce that was spicy but good.    The place is clean and so was the restroom. Parking is plenty so don't worry about that."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. What an experience. Food is awesome, plating is ridiculously simple. Must try."}
{"text":"one of the best BBQ restaurants in Vegas.. Truly authentic BBQ.. I am from Kansas City and St. Louis and this is the real deal.. Great family atmosphere and great folks running it. You will not be disappointed. The prices are family friendly too.."}
{"text":"Pretty sure we got last nights leftovers. And if not, that's no redeemer. Dry. No flavor. No seasoning. We had the brisket, ribs, and tri tip. Tri tip was the only almost redeemer, doused in their table bbq sauce, at best. The sides were decent, Mac n cheese was good... Fried okra was too fried. But it complimented the saltiness of all the other dishes. Beans were beans. Skip the corn on the cob. Basic. Loved the beer selection, until I drank my nearly room temp rogue, that was sitting on melted ice. Was looking forward to trying this place. But 2pm on a Saturday doesn't warrant this experience. Sorry, guys. 3 stars for the sides. That's it."}
{"text":"Venue is very clean. Staff is very friendly. Food is tasty and portions are large. Price is reasonable. Sauce is average."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come to Big B's for the longest time! My exceptions were blown out of the water! My family is from Texas, so when  it comes to BBQ, I'd like to think I know what is good. We ordered a full-rack of baby back ribs, chicken, mac & cheese and the chocolate cake! The ribs were smoked to perfection! They had the best flavoring to them. What topped it all off was the in-house sauces that brought out the smokiness PERFECTLY. Another important thing to notate is the interior design. They have engineered the space perfectly. There is no confusion where the line begins and there is a ton of seating! Everything in the establishment has been curated perfectly for the aesthetic... I felt like I was in the Lone Star State. This is a place I want to bring my family to. It's completely family friendly and a great spot for a family outing, all ages! Another notable mention is the staff. The woman who took our order demonstrated excellent customer service and was able to explain their product very well. Natalia is also a total gem and noticed it was my birthday... Safe to say this is my favorite BBQ spot in Las Vegas. I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket and sweet tea . Sliders are a great way to sample the menu. I drive all the way from summerlin , It's that good.  My mouths watering for some more right now"}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot out in Vegas/Henderson area.  I come to town often and always crave BBQ, now I found my spot.  Good atmosphere and great service.  The Tri Tip was excellent and so were the sides.  I like the bench style seating too.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place on three occasions and well it's not the best but deciding between a three and a four star it's definitely closer to four  The first time I went I had a three meat plate tritip brisket and pulled pork for 15.99 for three meets and 2 sides it's a decent value  Brisket was very good nice smoke ring with the tritip it had decent flavor but it didn't pop maybe it's because I'm from California and I've had Santa Maria style tri-tip most of my life I'm more used to a dry rub crust on the outside of my tritip, this was more juicy. The pulled pork didn't wow me it was decent but my my least favorite. I got the creamed corn and mac & cheese, mac & cheese was good I have had better and the creamed corn was kind of a thick consistency and very sweet, interesting pudding like texture.  The next time  I decided to go with a sandwich and not knowing how much meat we going to six-inch sub, I got a foot-long my only complaint was the up charge of three dollars for brisket or tritip wound up making it a $17 sandwich almost with tax. I actually turned it into two meals and it was good portion and this time the tritip was better than the first time. I would say you're better off getting a plate vs a sandwich at those prices unless you want to pulled pork or a hotlink sandwich  The most recent trip decided to try the same three meets again they kept on improving so that's why this is 4 stars, I got the bakedd beans and the cream corn again, The beans had a good flavor to them on the creamed corn that a completely different texture and consistency and was better and not as sweet  The owners and staff are nice, the space is nice and lots of open areas with TVs  While there are better barbecue places in town and traveling cross-country I've had better barbecue, for place that's a half a mile away from my office I'm sure I'll be going a few times a month, I like it more than the new Bell's BBQ (which wasn't horrible), this is just a better option"}
{"text":"Can never  go wrong with this place. Every time I eat here its always tremendous. Tried something new this time and hit up that meatloaf. I say again, can never go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This was the best bbq I have had outside of Texas. Everything was amazing. The ribs fell off the bone as we tried to eat them and the tri tip was fantastic. I loved the mustard based bbq sauce more that the other one. And the fried okra is great!! I highly recommend to Texans and otherwise!!!!"}
{"text":"Picnic tables and wooden spool chairs, check.  String of festive bistro lights, check. Decorative picket fence, check. Gingham tray liner paper, check. Broken BBQ hopes and dreams -- check, unfortunately.  The good: Ambiance gets a solid A. No doubt about it. This restaurant has definitely put in werk-werk-werk-werk-werk and thoughtfully executed its backyard Texas picnic concept. You can't even tell it was an old Jason's Deli. Furthermore, there's ample space and seating -- I almost expected a square dance to happen in the middle of the dining area since it was so spacious. Do-si-do, here goes the bad:  Food is mediocre. I was waiting for the wow factor, but sadly, it never came. I got the #5 Po Boy with pulled pork, which comes with 2 sides. (I chose fried okra and mac+cheese, which I had to wait for. It's okay since I knew it would come out fresh.) My boyfriend got the #7 Sliders, which comes with 3, so you can choose 3 different meats. He chose the creamed corn and cornbread (which you have to pay an add'l $1.50 for). We didn't know why because the single cornbread was so tiny and dry. Actually, all the meats were pretty dry. Even when I added the sauce. The sides were the tastiest part of my meal -- Fried okra w/ ranch is good, creamed corn surprisingly good. So there's that. Sides are still contenders in the bbq battle.  I'd pick the chains at this point (Famous Dave's, Lucille's, etc) and that's not to say I haven't tried downright authentic Texan BBQ. I have! (Salt Lick and Stubb's FTW -- meaning \"for the win\" just to clarify, not Ft. Worth lol) I'm not a barbecue snob at all, but I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that roasted this place. We've had better."}
{"text":"Lunch was the best! Wife and I had brisket, pulled pork, smoked turkey and ribs. As for sides we had potato salad, BBQ beans and fried okra. Wife had a corn cob as a free side. Then the sweet tea...mmmmmm."}
{"text":"We tried the ribs, tri-tip, brisket, and sausage along with some sides. The tri-tip was the star, all agreed. Leaner than the brisket, but with a great smoky smooth flavor. The ribs were great as was the brisket. They had tons of different sauces to choose from...I liked the spicy Texas sauce the best..it was kick! The reason for the 4 stars were the sides...very disappointing! The potato salad was weird, coleslaw we all tried and nobody liked, the beans tasted like they were in a bbq sauce soup. Very heavy and overwhelmingly not good. Prices are steep, meats are great, avoid the sides..."}
{"text":"I decided to come here the evening of April 26th to watch the GK game & have some BBQ with my boyfriend. I even found out we were able to get a free side with a check-in so that made me happy. After ordering I noticed the prices weren't very cheap but wanted to get a beer anyway to enjoy my night off. After tipping, cashing out, & waiting about 10 minutes, our food came. I immediately noticed my meat was soaked in oil. My boyfriends brisket was great & he enjoyed it. The mac&cheese was good, a little too cheesy like I was just eating cheese sauce some of the time. I really liked the beans, they had a nice smoky, bbq flavor & were a little spicy. I couldn't get over that greasy ass pork, I didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe it was the last of the batch, or they didn't bother to drain it or something but it was awful & a little salty too. I also enjoyed my draft Blue Moon. Next time I will try the chicken or ribs."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Everyone is super friendly. Never been to an actual Texas BBQ restaurant and It was an experience. Recommend this to any BBQ lover!!"}
{"text":"Barbecue meats and sides are really tasty and everyone is very friendly.  My only complaint is that the portion is not Texas sized. Either that I'm a big eater or the food is too good, I was still hungry after the two meat plate.   I will be back again but I will remember to order more if I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Thank you for the awesome experience today. I loved my brisket. We sure will be back for more."}
{"text":"I went in around 1pm and it was completely quiet.  I took the receipt to the register and had to wait for the female in the flannel shirt to stop talking to her friends(or fam) sitting at a table.   Tri-tip was good. Mac & cheese good.  BBQ beans worst I've ever tried. Super dark, almost burnt and very thick. Corn bread was more of a corn muffin. Dry.  Sandwich for bread was a basic white roll. Dry.   Go to Bell's BBQ which is around the area. Way better!"}
{"text":"Worst bbq I ever had the rib are boil in water and then place in a oven to bake no smoke no taste at all the fries where cold and just two pieces of bread that was dry out and the corn on the cob was just plain nasty not place to go if you are a looking for good bbq place"}
{"text":"This place has amazing BBQ! The pulled pork was cooked to perfection and the potato salad tasted so delicious. Nice work. I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The address is wrong, I'm in Nevada not California. This is for the location on St. Rose in Henderson. I'm so angry and disappointed with my purchase. I ordered a Rib plate, paid $16.00 and it wasn't worth it at all! The Mac & Cheese was salty as hell, and the corn on the cob was old and dried out. Keep your money and spend it elsewhere.. Trust Me!!"}
{"text":"Had Big B's today for the first time and I cannot recall the last time I had tasted BBQ so amazing!!! Will defiantly be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about this place starting with a great looking interior that sets the stage for some great BBQ. The rustic/down-home feel is everywhere -- from the picket fence to the wooden picnic tables to the old license plates hanging up everywhere. And, in case you didn't know the owner is from Texas, you will after seeing all the Texas gear and longhorn symbols (as well as an A&M flag) on the walls.  In the center of the room is a stack of wood that they use to smoke their BBQ. If you look into the open kitchen you'll see the smoker at work. The barbecue it produces is some of the better stuff in the valley. The brisket, in particular, is exceptional. Charred edges, a noticeable smoke ring that's also apparent upon tasting it, and tender enough to cut with a plastic spoon. It shouldn't be missed. Baby back ribs are dry rubbed and smoked and have a fantastic bark coating the exterior of the fall-off-the-bone meat. The pulled pork is solid, too. Although I needed to drizzle some sauce on it. Their sauce has a mild kick that will linger in the back of your palate. The corn bread was only ok, and the creamed corn wasn't as thick as I prefer, but still decent.  With Big B's and Bell's BBQ, Henderson has some tasty options when you're craving BBQ."}
{"text":"Real smoked BBQ and perfect sides! Tri-tip melts in your mouth and the smokey turkey dipped in sauce was delicious. Spacious dining room and friendliest staff ever! Looking forward to the next time we will go back!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely divine.  Truly the best BBQ I've ever had.  It was even better than the BBQ my grandmother used to make. Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"Idk where to start Thankyou Ryan! The owner Ryan is amazing I just stopped by all the way from blue diamond Vegas locals know how far that is and tried to use my Christmas gift to pay (a $50 gift card) and there system couldn't accept it so instead the owner Ryan generously offered to trade me $50 for my card i of course had to prove that it was actually an active working card even though he insisted he didn't care if I did so nice ! I Thankyou so much and this food omg mouth watering beef ribs, brisket, and a hot link plus all the sides love you guys and you have a customer for life !! Thankyou Ryan for your generosity happy holidays and new year ;)"}
{"text":"Food is well priced and it's good! Owner was on site and very personable and a nice guy. Ribs, beans, brisket and the Mac and cheese are delicious. Ribs might be over cooked for some as the meat falls off the bone. That's ok with me if they are good and they are. Nice color and smoke rings in the meat, very moist and tender. Good verity of sauces also. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I Would rate this new BBQ AS AN 8.5 Out of 10 for the overall rating. I am a meat and BBQ LOVER and a sauce King. Here's my review - I had the 1/2 Baby Back Ribs, Tri-tip and beef brisket baked beans and cole slaw and white bread for beverage - wine. Baby back ribs 10/10 amazing flavor moist thick and full of meat no boning around Tri-tip 9/10 - fantastic savory taste - a bit too much fat on two pieces but hey - flavor Beef Brisket - 8/10 nice texture flavor and \"crust\" Baked beans 9/10 - wonderful flavor with two types of beans big thick chunks of meat and a wonderful sweet flavor with a tad hint of some hotness  Cole Slaw - 6/10 - I love Coke slaw and like it sweet and creamy and theirs was a bit lacking - had a hint of pineapple ?? White bread - 9/10 throw back memories of wonder bread Sauces - sweet red - 9/10 great sauce; green vinegary - Carolina style - 6/10. Wine - beer - great selection and surprised to see Educated Guess as a featured wine - really nice! Overall atmosphere 9/10 - feels like you are on a ranch - employees enthusiastic and friendly and seem to enjoy making their great products a way to make you and your family happy ! One of best I've been to - go enjoy and spread news that this is BIG FLAVOR - and totally yu"}
{"text":"First time here. I just moved to Las Vegas from Fort Worth, TX. Had the 3 meat combo plate with 2 sides and a soft drink. $18 so seemed pretty pricy but my plate was enough to easily feed 2 people so keep that in mind. The brisket was flavorful, I would have preferred it a little juicier. The pulled port and hot link we as expected. The pork was ricnh with a nice amount of smoke and the hot link was hot with a nice texture.   Nice to know I have a place to get Texas style BBQ."}
{"text":"Glad we found this little gem.  No frills just great service and amazing meats. Almost didn't leave a review just so I can keep this place to myself."}
{"text":"First time at Big B's.. meat and Mac and cheese were great just the baked beans were really spicy.. to spicy for me."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is quite good. It's slow smoked, traditional/authentic style BBQ. The meats are served dry, with sauces on the table, as is traditional. I've had the pulled pork, brisket, tri-tip, baby back ribs, and chicken. All have been good, but the pulled pork is my favorite. (There are a couple I haven't tried yet).  Most of the menu items come with choice of sides. My favorites here are the potato salad, BBQ beans, Mac and cheese, and cream corn.  This is better-than-average BBQ at reasonable prices, with large servings. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's quite good. Definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"I was in the Rising Canes' drive through when I saw this place. Bye bye Rising Canes. Hello Texas BBQ. I was in awe upon entry. Very different from the Vegas norm. The seating was extremely open style with benches n a brick wall layer. Greeted with a smile as I ordered.   The have a diverse food menu. I even tried the pork tips n I'm not huge on pork. The To-go food was ready in like 5 minutes.   Very chill place to hang out especially on weekends. I bet they'll be slammed Memorial weekend and 4th of July weekend.   I'll be back. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"If you are near St Rose Pkwy, you HAVE to stop by this place.  As soon as you walk in you smell the wood. Very casual bbq style like you are in Texas.  Brisket and ribs are bomb and the creamed corn is a must.  Only side I'm not wowed by is the potato salad as it was a bit salty and could have used some cayenne.  Well worth the visit though."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ this place makes me feel like I'm back at home in Texas. Great job you guys!"}
{"text":"The moment you drive into the parking lot you can smell the delicious barbecue aroma coming from big b's! The pulled pork is perfectly seasoned and not dry at all like some places. I have to say that my favorite is the smoked turkey! I'd say try to find it somewhere else, you cant! The ambience is great when you walk in. It's perfect for a family setting or just to have some amazing shiner bock on Draft with some friends! Nothing like a Texas beer with Texas food! Did I mention they have lone star?! By far the best barbecue I've had. None of the meat is covered in sauce so you can actually taste that real smoked barbecue and rub. Real authentic Texas barbecue ladies and gents! And the service is amazing for a place that just opened!"}
{"text":"Finally! Some really great BBQ here in Anthem.  Lucille's was ok but very \"chain-like.\"  Then came Bell's BBQ which was like that date that you really wanted to like but just didn't feel anything there.  Finally, this BBQ place is the real deal.  If you noticed, most of the bad reviews were from people ordering the sliders or the po boy.  The sandwich is definitely the weakest (and cheapest) part of the menu.  Go for the pure BBQ - ribs, chicken, tri tip without the bread.  What they call \"hot\" sauce really wasn't that hot but it had a nice kick to it.  My only complaint is that they mailed out menus and it was clear that the person who came up with the pricing didn't think it through very clearly and you could easily \"game\" the menu.  When you showed up to order, they wouldn't honor the price.  It was only $1 but it left a bad taste.  You lost a lot of enthusiasm (and a star) over a buck."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Love the use of all the reclaimed wood.   Had the baby back ribs, the brisket and the creamed corn.  All great dishes.  Just opened a few days ago so I'm sure it's going to get even better.  My 6 year old says the rubs were even better than mine!  Not sure how I feel about that."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Worth everyday dollar, fills you up faster than you can say BBQ."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome! I give them a 5 star rating. Very helpful and always asked if we needed anything at the table. The food is good. I had the ribs. I am Indian so I am some what picky with my meats. The meat on the ribs is good but not like lucilles or chilis, a little fatty if you ask me.  None the less I enjoyed my meal with a refreshing root beer and potato salad.   If I had a separate category for service then I would give them 5 STARS for Heather  who was super friendly and helpful.  Shout out to all the other guys, thank you."}
{"text":"One of the best casual bbq restaurants.  Super friendly staff.  Great food.  Recommend !"}
{"text":"We get takeout here all the time It's quick and the food is excellent and consistent. I love the turkey and coleslaw, my husband likes the tri tip. Fries are excellent, without the seasoning. Service is good too."}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever had!  You want meaty ribs falling off the bone come here!!! Delicious way better then Famous Daves and Lucille's. Wow I can't believe I waited so long to come. You'll love it!!! The decor inside is awesome too!"}
{"text":"One star is too much for this place!! I ordered 50 dollars in BBQ I got 4 ribs 6 mini corn muffins, small box of fries and piece of pecan pie!! Which would be ok if the food was suitable for human consumption! The Ribs had no sauce at all. The ribs were so tuff I loosened my teeth trying to eat them! You could tell they just threw a naked bone on a high fire and see how fast they could burn it done. The corn muffins advertised as corn bread smelled horrible made me want to vomit the smell coming out of that bag. Yes I said bag they threw them into a plain brown paper bag. Didn't matter I wasn't eating them it was horrible smelling! The fries were soggy and under cooked; just a pile of mush! The pecan pie was in a apple pie crust and was not good at all! I feel totally ripped off! These reviews on here have too be the owners of the restaurant no way someone could be happy with this place! Someone needs to explain to this horrible restaurant. Corn bread is suppose to be savory served with butter. BBQ ribs are suppose to be fall off the bone served in or with BBQ sauce! French fries are suppose to stand up not requiring a spoon to eat! Pecan pie is suppose to be sweet and served in a brown pecan crust! Save your money and run away from this restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it didn't hit the mark. I ordered the 2 meat 2 sides meal, ribs, tri tip, mac and cheese and coleslaw. First things first the tri tip was a little dry for my taste, the ribs were tender but lacked any smoked flavor. Now for my sides , mac and cheese was tasty but had about 2 tablespoons of oil that I drained from it, only had a couple of bites and threw it away. Same thing with the coleslaw flavorless only ate half. I hate writing negative reviews because I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately that didn't happen. 1 star for service"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Sunday with my 15 year old son.  Inviting very comfortable atmosphere with a wonderful barbeque smell. Lets all support places like this.  Very reasonable prices, big portions and smiling staff. I'll be back.  Oh yeah food was fantastic..."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in it smelled delicious. The ribs!!  Let me say it again, THE RIBS!!!!!  BBQ sauce is authentic and sooooo good. Clean, quick happy well trained staff and constantly checking up on us. Everything was fresh and yummy. We will be back"}
{"text":"Damn good and I've been craving it since the minute I left.  Stopped by Big B's while searching for a good hamburger in the area.  BBQ just sounded better.  It smelled amazing, so I got really excited about the prospect of some good smoked meats, which is not an easy find in this town.  Staff greeted us immediately and patiently answered all questions.  Great service.  The owner and his wife were also present and they stopped by the table to make sure everything was going well.    Huge menu, variety of sides and very reasonable prices.  The portions were very big.  They also have draft and bottled beer, including Shinerbock.  Better yet, they have delicious fresh-brewed sweet tea. I lived in the South for 8 years and it's hard to find that type of sweet tea outside of there.  This place nailed it.  I chose the brisket and tri-tip combo with mac and cheese and corn bread.  The meats were extraordinarily tender and were so good that they didn't even need sauce.  Their sauce is very good, not too sweet and just tangy enough for me.  The corn bread was moist, and the mac and cheese was creamy without being over the top.   The meal was fantastic.  They ship in their wood from Texas and you can absolutely taste the difference that makes in the meat.  It's a very casual place with 2 and 4-top tables and large picnic tables inside for large parties.  I was terribly impressed that they have modified picnic tables to accommodate wheelchair guests.    Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time I walked in and could smell the smoke, I knew I had found some real bbq.  Portions are great for both sides and meat dishes.  Tables are clean and plenty of tv's for watching games.  I used to commute through Vegas from California and always made a stop here.  Brisket is great along with pulled pork and tri tip.  Meats have gone through the slow cooking process correctly to where you really don't need a knife to cut them.  I lived in Texas for several years and have yet to find a good bbq place like this in CA, NV, UT region. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area, well worth the visit especially since they have been consistent each time I go there."}
{"text":"Love this place! The meat is very tender with a great smoky flavor. My favorite is the brisket, tri-tip, and the hot links. The staff is very courteous. I would definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"The customer service is amazing.   I tried various samples of the different meats, all amazing!  I finally decided on the brisket and baby back ribs with the creamed corn and Mac n cheese as my sides.  Needless to say there was way too much for me to finish, so I took it home and killed everything the next day for lunch.  GRUB!"}
{"text":"Great staff great food. Wonderful job catering our baby shower for a little less than 100 people. The sides here are just as good as the meats!"}
{"text":"We just came home with the Family Meal which serves 4 people, and now we have amazing food for a week!  All of the meats are tender and have an incredible smoky flavor.  We keep going back as their food is so good, but this is the first time I've tried the chicken.  It's so delicious!  Friendly staff and a good experience every time."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Town! Generous portions, and excellent house bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I thought I'd check out this, so called, Texas BBQ. It was overpriced for the amount you get and they charge you an extra 5 dollars to have ribs on a combo plate. Why? The cornbread was aweful. Who puts cinnamon in cornbread? The BBQ ribs and brisket were good, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Overall good Texas bbq. My only disappointment would be the Cornbread size. It was literally the size of their to-go bbq containers, my two slices of wheat bread was larger than that. If I knew it was that small of a side item I would've gotten a corn on the cob or something else. The chicken was moist and so was the brisket. The sauces  made up for the lack of portions. Would I come back again? Probably."}
{"text":"First time here. Super close to my house! Great service, brisket was perfect! Best potato salad in town! Big, clean space with cool seating. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. Will come back often!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Worked with them today for a company event of over 100 people. Everything was delivered hot, fresh and on-time. The food was fantastic and everyone was really pleased. The Tri-tip is phenomenal, ribs were amazing and the mac n' cheese is out of this world! Excellent food and service from Ryan and his team. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Place was very clean, food was flavorful. Would recommend the ribs, and the brisket.!!"}
{"text":"By far the best bbq in Las Vegas! Hands down. I love this place. The service is great and the portion sizes are big."}
{"text":"Big B's is fantastic. You see, having good barbeque is only part of the requirement to being a good barbeque restaurant. You also HAVE to have good sides. And that is where Big B's takes the cake.   All of their sides I have had here are great. Their fried okra is good, their beans are good, and their creamed corn...........let me tell you about their creamed corn. It's JUST like Grandma used to make. It's rich, it's creamy, it's delicious.  Also, a few barbeque places I've been to around Vegas have been missing the mark with their hot links and sausages. This place has some great links!   I recommend ANY of their meats here. And definitely make sure you get a side of creamed corn with with. You will not be disappointed.  Would I come back here? Oh yes I would!  Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely. I already have!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to Texas BBQ great service just a amazing experience every time"}
{"text":"Be aware of the up-pricing. At first this really turned me off. The way it was explained to us was kind of misleading. We wanted to try the different meat specials and the way it was explained was that you could order it and get a few bones for $5 extra. Cool! But no, it was if you want ribs, as a part of the platter, you would have to pay $5 for a few bones. Well, that was not looking promising.  When the order came...WHOA!!!! Not a few bones. It was like half a dozen. The plates were incredible. We could not even eat all the food. We had the baby back, the chicken, smoked turkey and hot links. All incredible. The corn bread were like muffins and had the slightest hint of cinnamon. CINNAMON! Brilliant. The slaw wonderful. The corn on the cob was a bit mushy, but it was close to closing, so I'm sure if we had gone earlier, it would have been fine. The picnic table idea is cute, but I found chunks of food between the slats. Not a huge thing, but kinda gives me the creeps. The lighting is low, so it is hard to see if it is night. Again, not a huge thing, just...eww.  I can guarantee that we will be back. The food was very reasonable considering the quantity."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my brisket and my husband was very happy with his chicken. You can choose your sides from multiple options but our favorites by far are the beans,coleslaw and even the french fries (the seasoning on them is really good). Someone complained about the bread but I don't agree: it tasted fresh each time we were there. The owners are always present,making sure their customers are satisfied.  We really like this place!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and well worth coming to regardless of what part of town you're on!  The food is awesome, spectacular is more like it!  Great service, good choice of options for sides which are just as delectable as the main courses, and the desserts are really good too.   The restaurant itself is really nicely laid out, spacious, and great ambience, not too formal, great low key spot to enjoy a great meal in an awesome environment.   If you haven't been here yet, I highly recommend it, it gets my approval being born and raised in the south as were accustomed to having good BBQ restaurants in abundance."}
{"text":"Good food, Place is nice and clean Very easy menu , would give it 5 stars but waited longer then I was told  Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Big B's Texas BBQ has made good use of the old Jason's Deli location on St. Rose.  The smell of delicious pit barbeque hits you in the parking lot.  Once inside, their simple but kitschy picnic table, wood clad walls, and picket fence d√©cor is somehow homey and airy at the same time.    You counter order, receive a number, pay, and grab your drink while you wait.  They have a Coke Freestyle machine, sweet and unsweetened tea, beer, and wine.  We ordered two 2-meat combos.  I got the Sliced Brisket and the Tri-tip with the mac n cheese and the BBQ beans.  Unlike some other unlucky reviewers, both my brisket and tri-tip were moist and full of flavor with a great crust and smoke ring.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the Tri-tip, but I'd call it close.  The beans were full of chunks of meat and are definitely the best  I have had in Vegas.  The mac and cheese was also quite delicious; creamy and definitely not bland like a lot of places.  The BF chose the Hot Link and Beef Ribs ($5 upcharge) with the slaw and beans.  The Hot Link was juicy and just a little spicy.  The Ribs didn't come out for about 10 minutes after the rest of the food and were a bit tough, but the flavor was good.  The slaw was crisp and fresh tasting, but a bit bland.  We will definitely be back to try the pulled pork, baby backs, cornbread, and other sides!"}
{"text":"Great food.Great atmosphere. Brisket melts in your mouth. Baked beans full of flavor. Wish there was one in Summerlin. But until then we'll be back."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I naturally wanted to try this out while I was in town.  The restaurant is decorated pretty cool. You definitely get a Texas feel while being here.  Heck, they even have Shiner Beer!  Now to the food.  Texas has some wonderful BBQ places like Blacks, SaltLick, Hard Eight, Goode Company and a ton others.  I would have to say this place was pretty average.  I have had worse, but have had better.   I ordered a two meat plate - ribs and sausage with potato salad and coleslaw.  The ribs were dry and the sausage was plain.  The coleslaw wasn't good at all.  The potato salad was ok.   The BBQ sauce was nothing to talk about.  I was hopping it had more flavor.    What I would recommend to this place is work on the BBQ sauce and more flavor to the meat.  The coleslaw needs to be totally revamped.  Also, a little overpriced.  I paid $24 for my meal and gave them a $3.50 tip.    I think that this place has a good atmosphere and the staff seemed to be friendly.  It was very clean as well.  I wish them nothing but success."}
{"text":"So much food. So little stomach.  We got here 45 min before closing. There was a couple of people in the restaurant. The staff was very friendly. There were even people coming in right at closing and they were still so friendly! I really like how how they have all the condiments at every table. It's very useful!  We decided to get the one meat plate and also the slider plate. Both options come with two sides. We also used the free side when you check in. For our plate we got ribs, which was an extra $5 up charge to the plate. The sides we got for this plate were beans, fries, and mac and cheese. The ribs were pretty good, but I think I would have rather gotten a meat option that didn't have the extra $5, didn't seem as worth it to me. I was a huge fan of the mac and cheese. Even when I was full, I made sure there was no mac left behind!   The sliders were good. You pick your meat. We were able to get three different options so we were able to try all kinds of sliders! It's an assemble yourself type slider, but it's helpful so you can add all the sauce you want!   All in all, I'll definitely be back again, hopefully a whole lot hungrier."}
{"text":"OMG - I wish I would've read the bad reviews first.  I cannot believe some of the responses from the business that I was reading.  Most, if not all, of the customers that wrote about their experience and the quality of the food are NOT in the wrong for doing so and shame on her for being so condescending.  These are the types of things customers want to know before they decide on coming in and spending their money with any business.  I was finally able to coax my hubby to try out this place after almost a month of passing by here on my way to and from meetings during the day. It was about 7pm and we were greeted by a friendly guy at the beginning of the assembly line, he was very helpful in explaining the menu and made suggestions as well. Ultimately we decided to go with a 3-meat plate (brisket, tri-tip and jalapeno link w/ creamed corn and fried okra) and an order of 1/2 slab of beef ribs - all to go.  Total came to a little over $40.  They let us know that the ribs were going to take about 15 minutes to grill and as they were mentioning that, we noticed one of the employees pull out a pack from somewhere - not sure if it was a fridge or freezer and slice the slab in half.  My jaw dropped at the sight of the beef ribs, which were not the beef ribs we were used to getting that have the nice big juicy piece of meat on top of the bone...I was appalled and at an $18 price point too, I couldn't believe this is what they were serving.  Since this was our first time, I tried to keep an open mind and was hoping the flavor and quality of the other meats would redeem the rest of the meal. Nope - brisket and tri-tip were both dry and flavorless - I tried forking the brisket and it kept crumbling into sad hard pieces of rock.  Hubby tried one of the beef ribs and was ready to toss the rest - the meat on the bones was scarce and I can tell he did not enjoy any of it.  He was so upset and I felt so bad. The jalapeno link and fried okra were the only two items out of our $40+ dinner that were decent - BUT THIS IS A BBQ JOINT!  And none of the other meats met the grade...not good!  Nonetheless, I was very disappointed - I hate being wrong with new places to try when it seems like the good reviews were so abundant.  Next time I need to skip the hype and go straight to the HONEST reviews.  Try at your own risk.  Customer Service - 4 Atmosphere - 3 Food Quality - 1 Price Point - 1"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since day one and the food here has consistently been outstanding. I haven't had one \"off day\" getting food there. Great service and the prices can't be beat.   I usually come and get the meat by the pound. Brisket, tri tip, or pulled pork and take home. One thing is for sure. I tell everyone I know that if they want great bbq to go to Big Bs."}
{"text":"we ordered the 3 meat plate with a side of potato salad and mac/cheese with a jalapeno hot link order on the side.  plenty of food for 2 and tasted great!  the corn bread muffins were the best!  great staff as well, first time there and the staff at the front was totally helpful and recommended what to eat perfectly."}
{"text":"Nevada is obviously not known as a BBQ hot spot, but thankfully Big B's BBQ fills in that void. We had four hungry guys, and once inside, it was devour time! Great size servings, meats were tender and flavorful, solid seasoning, friendly staff.    The inside of the restaurant had a great authentic feel. We were tourists in Vegas, but it was definitely worth the drive from the strip for the best BBQ within state lines."}
{"text":"The brisket was like butter, fell apart when using fork to move it to my plate. It was delicious.  The fries and okra were ok.  We all felt the iced tea was great and authentic for a Texas BBQ place. It made us homesick.  I loved the BBQ sauce, but they had only one variety.  It might be better to have sweet, spicy, etc   My family always makes ordering a chaotic I ordeal, but  the line servers and cashier were patient and friendly.  The place was clean and roomy."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I know it's bbq... Bravo to the owners for awesome service and the tastiest Bbq in vegas."}
{"text":"Not Texas bbq...hardly bbq at all. The beef link is a glorified hot dog with was way over-priced. The baked beans were so spicey hot we had to throw away an entire pint as unedible. And the \"PO Boy\"...clearly these filks have not been to New Orleans. They charged me an upcharge for a brisket PO Boy and gave me 3 slices of meat and a piece of bread...which cost MORE than a 1/2 pound of brisket. If you want your.PO actually dressed...thats extra...a lot extra. As for the brisket, the lean brisket was fairly tender and wasnt bad. The sauce is tomato based and had a weird finish but had some nice heat without being crazy hot like the baked beans.   I brought all.of this to their attenton. The staff was nice and friendly. But it felt like a rip-off. On a Sat night there was one couple eating, one that came while I was waiting and a man with his toddler son. In other words, almost empty on the one night everyone eats out...that should tell you something.  I might give them another try in a few months, but I feel so cheated by their rip-off and their flippant attitude about it."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the place smelled great when we walked in! The food, however, was hit and miss. The chicken and the brisket were not worth ordering again. The tri-tip was excellent. The hot link was quite good and definitely hot! As to sides, the potato salad was good! The pasta salad and baked beans were not worth ordering again. The side of bread was dried out.   Also, it may be a Texas thing to not have plates, but I learned I really enjoy when my food comes on a plate.   $30 for two (without alcohol) was too spendy for our experience."}
{"text":"Read other reviews and almost didn't try it out. Had a friend say it was ok, pricey, but not bad. Didn't make me want to go out of my way. I grew up on BBQ and love meat... The first thing I noticed when we parked was the amazing smoke aroma!! Most of the menu is smoked btw not BBQ, but that not a complaint. My son and I were very pleased and full. We even left with food left over.   He misunderstood while he was ordering and gave up a side for cornbread, which he didn't realize he did. When we got the food and we were confused our kind waitress said don't worry it must have not been explained correctly, which I agreed. So brought him out his side and he was super happy.   We were glad we tried it, will recommend. Will go again. The atmosphere in the dining area it picnic style which is great to bring people together. Glad to have a BBQ joint right around the corner. Good Job Big B!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Allset, first time here. Absolutely delicious food. We ordered the smoked turkey sliders with fries and potato salad and the pulled pork sliders with fries and mac and cheese. Plan on coming back to try out the ribs next! Wonderful customer service. Can't say enough good things about this joint!"}
{"text":"Excellent beef ribs and brisket!!! Love the open atmosphere of the dining room. To bad it's on the opposite side of town from me."}
{"text":"Soo good!!!! Great food and the people are the nicest in town. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best bbq I have had hands down in this town!!! Meat was flavorful, juicy, & well seasoned!! Atmosphere was kinda quiet. The owner is from Texas so he knows good bbq!! The mustard Carolina bbq sauce was awesome!! We live on the other side of town & we will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Never disappoints!! Ribs fall off the bone and meat is tender and juicy on items. Sides are delicious too!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love all their meats! One of (the many) best things about this place is that they don't drowned their meat in sauce! They allow you to taste the meat and awesome flavor first before the sauce hits the meat! Real BBQ with real flavors!! They have 2 flavorful sauces...I like them best mixed together! Going here is a must! If you want BBQ and can't dine in or take out go to BiteSquad.com and order delivery!"}
{"text":"I was so frustrated with this place because they ran out of ribs my first attempt going there, so I decided to leave and go to another BBQ place. Then I thought I'd come back another day because I was dying to eat their food, well then another bad experience. So here goes: I ordered my food got to the register and didn't know how my three meals plus drinks came to $60. Well this place has an up charges when you get ribs when you pick two meat deal (they didn't tell me this when I ordered, they may tell you this now after reading this review, oh but it was written on the board in small print) and they weren't even that good. So I asked the manager  don't remember her name, but probably the one who responded, \"why was the meals so expensive?\", she said \"well if we don't up charge for our ribs, then we  would be giving them away\". I was pissed not only to her comment but at the fact that they weren't that good, who says that to a customer? Well I decided that Id never go back there to eat. Back to famous dave's it is!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town with my family and my mom originally wanted a seafood buffet. After searching for one that was fairly cheap as well as good, I found out that the cheapest and best Sunday seafood buffet was at M Resort, but to my mom's dismay, it was $39.99 per person. So she said forget it and wanted BBQ instead. As my husband was driving to the nearest gas station (which by the way I was also looking up gas prices on Gas Buddy), I was frantically searching for a BBQ place close by. Now I'm pretty particular about my BBQ. So when I saw this place on Yelp, which has 4 stars at almost 400 reviews, I was hoping the Yelpers won't lead me astray on this one.   My fellow Yelpers did not! Mind you, my parents are old and they can't hear well and it takes a while for them to figure out what they want to eat, especially my dad. He always asks \"what's good Gracie?\" I always tell him, \"anything you order, dad\". So when we entered the restaurant and was greeted by the nice man placing our order, the man was very patient and kind with my parents. So kudos to that guy.   We all ordered plates -- 1 to 3 bbq items and 2 sides. BONUS: we got an extra side for checking in on Yelp. So don't forget to check in! We ordered beef ribs, pork ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, mac and cheese, fried okra, potato salad, coleslaw, cornbread, and corn.   Mom paid for us at the counter after we were done ordering. We went to the Coke machine, which is one of those really cool ones with like 100 flavors and grabbed a seat at one of the larger picnic tables. Not more than 10 minutes later, we received our food. Everything smelled smoky and looked so juicy. Those smoke rings though... the cornbread... meh, but everything else was superb!  Definitely try this place out if you're looking for good bbq in the South LV area."}
{"text":"I have to say that BBQ is such temperamental food. It has to be cooked and stored and served all within a time frame where all that hard work is actually noticeable and enjoyable.   I've experienced first hand getting microwaved items from a local establishment and was skeptical to eat here when I saw how empty it was during an early lunch. I did end up being served one of the best bbq meals I've ever had in my life. I have to say that's not saying much since I've only had bbq in Vegas.  My favorite item here is the turkey oddly enough. The brisket was also equally drool worthy. I also love all of their sides. The macaroni and cheese is amazing too. I like how this is just traditional bbq with no fancy or extra this or that. It's just solid food that's very satisfying.  My favorite thing about bbq is that the reason it tastes good is the technique that's used. It's just naturally good on its own aka I don't like sauce.  Everything is always super moist and fresh. They also have beer to enjoy with your meal. The space itself is very very big with picnic style benches. I'm totally into it.  I can't say anything about service because you don't really deal with the employees after your food is dropped off. They are always pleasant up front though.  I recommend getting a plate with a couple of sides and some slices of white bread. I honestly think the servings are enough to share and a good way to sample their meats."}
{"text":"Man oh man have I missed my Texas BBQ! This spot is perfect for some comforting lean (or not so lean) meat, home style sides including the best beans west of Big Bend. All the meat is gluten free, the sauces as well, just avoid the free bread that comes when you get a family meal!"}
{"text":"Big B's is easily my favorite BBQ in town after just one visit!   The meat is tender and lean without all the extra fat.   The Mac and Cheese is phenomenal, but watch out--there's a kick to them!"}
{"text":"Short Review:  We have everything in Las Vegas when it comes to food. A couple of years ago, a ton of sushi restaurants were opening like it was going out style.  \"Hot and New\" donut places, poke bowl spots, burger joints, coffee shops, and BBQ restaurants can be found are all over Sin City.  We are definitely spoiled and the food competition here is fierce.  With all the different BBQ restaurants out here, it's very tough to determine who is best. But when it comes to a really good brisket and tri-tip, Big B's has to rank up there.   Not So Short Review:  Bookmark Checked!! What the heck took me so long to eat at Big B's?  I remember reading Michael K's review about their brisket and immediately bookmarked Big B's.  This was over a year ago.  I finally got the opportunity try Big B's a couple of days ago and came back again today.  I was disappointed and impressed at the same time. I was disappointed in myself for not coming here sooner and impressed with the food. Michael K. was right about the brisket.  Big B's brisket deserves all the praise that it gets.  You get the option of lean or moist brisket.  The lean brisket is good and I didn't find it to be dry like other Yelpers have stated. The brisket is so tender that I had to eat it with a spoon. Their moist brisket is perfection if you prefer a fattier piece of meat.  If you're one of those Yelpers that thought the brisket was too dry, then get the moist brisket next time.  Another highlight for me is their Tri Tip and Beef Link.  You really can't go wrong with any of these choices. I have tried most of their sides as well.  My favorite is their creamed corn and BBQ beans.  I'll take my brisket or tri-tip and dip it into the BBQ beans.  Oh my goodness, it's good.  The prices are fair.  You'll get more bang for your buck with their multiple meat combos.  The combos come with two sides and they definitely do not skimp on the meat.   The restaurant is named after the owner Brian.  He's the Big B.  The service is great and the employees keep this place clean. The restaurant is also very spacious with picnic style benches all over the place.  Big B's is big enough to serve a large party and still quiet enough to enjoy your meal.  It took me so long to try Big B's because it's located so far from home.  Good news, though.  According to the owner, Big Brian is looking for a spot near our hood. In my opinion, Big B's has some of best brisket and tri-tip in Las Vegas. That's just my opinion.  Peace!!   2017 Yelp Review #78"}
{"text":"Wow... Really really good pulled pork sliders. Mac and cheese is amazing as well. I was very happy. You need to eat here. Yum!"}
{"text":"An amazing barbecue spot- great for big groups! They have tvs throughout the restaurant which is great for watching games. The baby back ribs were my personal favorite but everything we tried was spot on. If you like spicy sauce, be sure to ask for their house made hot sauce! The mac and cheese was also delicious and complimented everything I was eating. The staff was very informative about selecting the best items on the menu. Definitely the best bbq spot I've tried yet. Cant wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Finally some delicious bbq!!! We've been searching around Vegas and I have to say everything about this place is great. The smell when you walk in tells you everything you need to know. The sliders, nicely proportioned. The sides we got were Mac and cheese and creamed corn. Also a side of corn bread, which was flavored with some type of spice making it taste like a pumpkin spiced corn bread. Sweet tea was perfect, and the dessert selection is hard to choose. We will be back sooner then later!!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good Texas BBQ...love this place!! Great service & prices so reasonable. Try the okra & brisket!!!! Off The Hook!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that the local BBQ scene has come into its own just yet, but with the proliferation of businesses such as this one, it's definitely on the right track.  Big B's Texas BBQ has been open for little more than a month at this St. Rose Siena Hospital-bordering location, but they're already drawing big crowds. It wasn't even peak dinner yet on this Friday evening, but I witnessed the post-work rush build a long line and fill up at least half of the wooden benches in the \"cafeteria.\" They have plenty of staff in the back to handle the traffic, and some employees do filter into the dining area from time to time to deliver certain sides, take away completed trays, replace relatively empty BBQ sauce dispensers, etc.  The menu is straightforward, with a series of plates, sandwiches/salads, sides, and \"family style\" meats (aka a la carte) I was hungry, so I went for the 3 Meat Plate ($15.99) with ribs (+$4) and some other meats. The upcharge is still a good value when you consider the price of the baby back ribs a la carte, which is $5 more for a half slab than the other meats. The portion was at the very least on par with other BBQ purveyors.  I guess we'll start the dissection with the meats. I sampled my friend's chicken first. It was smoky and ridiculously tender but otherwise a little bland. It's not a meat of choice for any smoked BBQ, so I'm not weighing it in too strongly. My tri-tip was next. I can see why Michael K. and others love this. It's super tender, smoky, and not dry.  The brisket (sliced, which I made sure to double-check thanks to Stefany V.) had all the beef brisket flavor that you could want, including the smokiness, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was a little dry. Maybe it's the lack of fat compared to other takes on beef brisket that I've enjoyed? I can't say it's my favorite brisket yet.  As for the ribs, I can see why people are fans. They had the most \"fall-apart\" character that I've seen, they're smoked well, and they have all the pork flavor that I expect in baby back ribs. However, they're seasoned a little gently and left me wanting the spicy kick that I loved at another local BBQ joint. Paired with the BBQ sauces, they were definitely tasty, but they're not my favorite ribs within even a mile of this location. Maybe it's just personal preference, but a spice rub seems necessary to distinguish this pork from other choices such as pulled pork.  On that note, I did find the BBQ sauces very good. Well, at least the traditional BBQ sauce was. With mild spiciness, sweetness, and some vinegar, it paired fairly well with all of the aforementioned meats. But compared to my favorite local BBQ sauce, it isn't \"divine.\" I didn't get the peaks of flavor that I wanted, and I didn't want to sip it through a straw afterward. The other sauce, which I would describe as honey mustard vinegar, did not complement anything except for the ribs. I ended up mostly using both sauces simultaneously on the ribs, and only the traditional sauce with the other meats.  They're also doing great things with the sides, but the ones that I tasted were far from perfect. The coleslaw is just a little creamy and doesn't taste premade. The mac & cheese is really creamy and satisfying, and I'll probably order it for myself next time. The creamy corn had all of the corn flavor that I could want, and it didn't lack in creaminess, but it was a little bit on the sweet side. The BBQ beans could also be a meal in their own right with several meats already mixed in, but they're also on the sweet side. I can't imagine BBQ sauce, meats, and the sweet sides working harmoniously in the same mouthful, so there's a bit of \"anti-synergy\" going on, if you will.  Although Big B's Texas BBQ is working magic with meats and accompaniments, they didn't completely enchant my taste buds tonight. They do offer awesome sides and the best tri-tip around, but take that with a grain of salt because that cut of beef is not exactly a common offering among local BBQ restaurants. That all said, I do look forward to returning and giving them another opportunity when I'm in the area. Any carnivore should come here at least once.  (QUICK UPDATE 4/15/16: They should really put two people on taking orders. What a bottleneck. Anyway, tried a few different things this time. Jalape√±o cheese hot link was spectacularly juicy and at the very least medium in spiciness. I should order it myself next time. Pulled pork was great when I revisited it as leftovers, with fatty tender pork that paired well with the traditional BBQ sauce. Beef rib was nowhere near fall-off-the-bone tender, but had good flavor and paired extremely well with that enigmatic yellow sauce. French fries were pretty good and properly seasoned.)"}

My young son ate his meal and loved it which he doesn't eat much so I loved that! The two BBQ sauces weren't too spicy but had tons of flavor. Mac and cheese wasn't traditional like most places but was great and the beans had a nice smokey flavor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I can tell you this is the only BBQ place in town worth going to for brisket.  The smoked turkey is also amazing. Plus they have Shiner on draft. Real deal mesquite smoked BBQ."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a great welcoming family friendly atmosphere. This spot has the best BBQ. The brisket just falls apart and the tri tip was great too. Get the sides of Mac and cheese and baked beans yummm. I love the set up of the restaurant itself... It's decorated very well with picnic tables and outdoorsy vibe. Very clean and staff was very friendly. When I'm craving BBQ it's Big B's."}
{"text":"Great brisket, the ribs are to die for my favorite sides have to be between the mac n cheese and bbq beans  The service is great everything is made fresh. I would definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Read a lot of reviews and this place was great.  The food was fantastic and good size portions.  The price is very affordable especially for the amount of food you get.  The pulled pork sandwich melts in your mouth,  the fries are cut fresh and made to order. The corn bread wasn't traditional but it was moist and delicious.   The establishment is very clean and the staff was very nice. I would highly encourage you to try it."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Vegas!  It smells like BBQ heaven when you walk in the door!  Easy ordering and even faster service. Everything we ordered was mouth watering. Fried okra was crisp and delicious!!  Reminded me of home. Just be careful...it's good enough you'll forget you can take some home to eat later...they may have to roll you out of the building!"}
{"text":"What a great BBQ! The barbecue sauce on the ribs was very unique and had a great taste. The meat was tender and falling off the bones. I tried the brisket as well and this was very flavorful and quality meat. Lastly, don't forget about the mac and cheese! It's oh so good !"}
{"text":"I had some high hopes after reading the reviews for the restaurant. As an overall view, it came out a little lacking. Perhaps I encountered an off night.      I always like to give as much a try as possible, so I went with the 3 meat platter. My choices were brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs, with sides of fried okra and Mac-and-cheese. My friend went with a brisket plate and some sides.      I thought my platter was a decent size, but I felt a little bad for my friend. The single serving of brisket plate (with sides) was only 3 slices of brisket, and fairly thin ones at that.      For the food, I did think the brisket was pretty good. A little on the drier side, but good texture and smoke flavor. The pulled pork was a little odd. I had some very long, stringy, and tough pieces. An ok smoke flavor, but otherwise the rest was fairly bland. The ribs were a decent size portion, but otherwise weren't very good. Part of the issue was they were taken out of a covered tray that was filled with liquid. So they were very damp/wet and kind of soggy. No crust or smoky flavor left in them. They fell apart, but not in a good way. It was as if they were overcooked and just became kind of mushy. The tomato based BBQ sauce was ok, extremely sweet, kind of fruity.      As for the sides, the fried okra was pretty good, maybe a bit overly salted and peppered. I needed plenty of water with them. Good texture and could have been perfect with a little less seasoning. The Mac-and-cheese was a definite miss. Extremely overcooked pasta and kind of a container of soft mush.      The location was cool and the staff was extremely friendly. It's a shame that I felt like while nothing was totally terrible, a lot of things just missed and the food was very \"eh\".  Edit: I'd like to say I super-appreciate the time that one of the owners took to contact me on my review. Extremely professional and polite. I'd like to make sure it's clear, a lot of this was based off of my own, personal preferences. It's hard to give reviews without the perceived without the less-than-positive parts possibly coming off overly harsh or critical. While my tastes are what they are, for those who would and do enjoy this restaurant on a different place from my own opinions, I do recommend it based off of their professionalism and say it's worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Love it!! The food is awesome and the employees are even better! Cruz is so nice. She even brought our food out to our car cause we are both handicapped and don't get around too easily. We had the three piece combo.,.. double tri-tip and chicken   even though it is excellent the only thing disappointing thing is no one gives you half a chicken anymore.  It was only a thigh and leg (attached).   I would definitely recommend them to everyone"}
{"text":"Man oh man, this place is awesome! Prices, location, and interior are amazing!!! I got the 3 meat plate with tritip,turkey, and brisket....delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"So me and my Dad decided to head over here despite being on the other side of town. It was a co-worker's recommendation and she said it was the best in town as far as word of mouth. I'm always up for barbecue and if its Texas style then I'm sold. One thing I know about bbq restaurants is that the good ones usually sell all their good cuts within the first hours of opening. So to be fair it was wrong on my part to go here when they're almost closing.   There were still plenty of people. One guy was probably too eager to get to his food because he ended up missing the chair he was sitting on and tumbled backwards. A scene straight out of a comedy film. Or a meme. Whichever suits your fancy. But anyways, the place is spacious. There are park style benches all over the dining area and some round tables with an umbrella on the middle. Gives it a park feel. You walk up to the counter and place your order like any other bbq joint. I guess the owner was still there because he greeted us. Either he owned the place or he's a manager. Either way he didn't need a megaphone if he was a cop in a hostage situation or a bank robbery. Nope, not with a voice as loud as his. Its not bad, he greeted us after all.   So Me and my Dad both got a two meat plate. I got a Beef Rib and Brisket, he got Hot Links and Tri Tip. I was excited. Because when I saw the picture of the Beef Rib when my coworker showed it to me it was massive. And all the meat and fat on it was just making me hungry. So the food got to us and sadly I was kind of disappointed. The Brisket was good. Very tender, falls apart just using your fork. But it tasted kinda bland. No smoky flavor. I ended up having to douse it with a lot of their barbecue sauce on the side. Usually I don't like putting sauce on barbecue because I appreciate the effort and love that goes into cooking these meats. The Beef Rib, disappointed me. I mean I said from the start it was our fault for coming in at a short notice. The stuff we ate was probably gonna end up in the trash after closing. But the Beef Rib I got didn't have any meat on it. It was 70% rib 10% cartilage 10% fat and 10% lean meat. I didn't really like gnawing on a piece of rib that had a chunk of the meat cut out from it but that's what it felt like. As if someone sliced the actual meat on the top of the rib and then flash fried and then served it to us. I was honestly expecting something a little bit more presentable. Even if I wasn't enjoying the ribs I had to finish it because I didn't wanna make the place look bad. When the servers came to ask us how we were doing I just politely said \"we're good\" because they had a long day. No point in complaining about something that was my fault to begin with. The brisket did keep me full at least. That and my dad kind of felt sorry for me so he gave me some of his tri tip and hot links.   In my opinion I need to give this place another go. Preferably right after opening. Because like I said in the beginning. The better cuts are sold within hours from opening. So yeah I might drop by again tomorrow or sometime next week to try the beef ribs again. I saw some really juicy ones in the photos section and I want to have those cuts. Not the pathetic cut I got. But other than that the other choice of meats weren't bad. They weren't mind blowing either. I suppose I have a different idea as to what good barbecue tastes like. Not that I have any other places to recommend but seeing really good ribs on TV and having tried other BBQ places here in town. I would say Big B's wasn't any different from them. But we'll see."}
{"text":"Barbecue joints are getting to be a dime a dozen. It's getting to where you can't turn a corner without seeing a barbecue place. There are some that stand out. Big B's Barbecue is one of those stand out places in my opinion.  My wife and I each had a 3 meat plate with two sides. Each plate could definitely feed two people. We ended up taking home the leftovers. It seems pricy at $17.99 each but they're pretty big portions.  We each had the hot link, very generous portions of brisket and pulled pork all very tender and moist. We each had the Mac and cheese, but I had potato salad while she had the baked beans. I don't know what's in the baked beans but I almost snatched the cup from my wife. At first I was disappointed to see picnic tables. I have a big gut making it difficult to sit at picnic tables. These have high table tops making it easy for someone like me to sit in them. They also have wooden chairs and tables made from cable spools.  We've been to Dick's on Las Vegas Blvd, Famous Dave's, Lucille's and Memphis BBQ on Warm Springs. My wife and I both agreed this is our favorite.  We met the owner himself and the staff was super nice and friendly. I highly recommend trying this place if you love barbecue. If you eat too much it's conveniently near to Saint Rose Hospital."}
{"text":"Hands down best barbecue.  I was overly impressed just walking in.  Coors light on draft, decently priced, great food, great atmosphere.  I wish I could give more stars."}
{"text":"I tried the 12\" poboy with brisket. The meat was tender, but dry. I asked for the hottest sauce which turned out to be a mustard sauce. There wasn't enough sauce for the dryness of the meat. I tried to order the mac n cheese, but they didn't actually have it available. So I got the slaw and the potato salad. The potato salad had very big chunks of potato that were hard to eat without cutting and some chunks weren't cooked all the way through. By the time you add the brisket upcharge and tax, my total was $17 before tip for sandwich and salads. Too expensive for such low quality. The only thing saving this place is the employees were nice."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I will not be leaving a good review for Big B's Texas BBQ! My wife and I placed an order for some BBQ from Big B's. We read great reviews online and we were eager to try their food! The delivery guy shows up, nice guy...We get the food insude....only to discover that the fries were soggy and had been cooked in dirty greese! Not one of those fries were edible!... I took pics  The tri tip was just okay....My wife had the pull pork, it was decent...better than the trip tip. Big B's gets one star from us...and we are being generous with that! We contacted them about the soggy nasty fries and we have yet to hear back...that was last week"}
{"text":"The BBQ beans are amazing. The tri-tip was also good but damn, those beans! Great relaxed place to eat..."}
{"text":"Dry meats, had to salt all my food. Really cool layout for the restaurant though. Would not go again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town hands down! ?Meat quality and service was outstanding! Natalia was great!"}
{"text":"This is now the second time I have been here and once again the food is amazing! This is up there with real BBQ in Texas! The tri tip and brisket is so flavorful and moist! You barely need BBQ sauce with their meats! You can smell their smoker inside and outside of the restaurant! The mac and cheese is also amazing, great flavor as well! If you show them the yelp app, you get a feee side! Service is also great, friendly and personable! The only negative thing about this place is you have to drive all the way cross town to get to it since I don't live in Henderson! I wish this place nothing but success and a very bright future!"}
{"text":"Delish, all the way around.  The meats, the sauces, baked beans, mac n cheese, even the pies were all great. Been here 4times now, and haven't been disappointed in anything yet. And I love the convenience of being able to order and pay ahead of time"}
{"text":"Wowwww what a hidden gem. The ribs and the briket are to die for! I'm so happy and it's only minutes from home. Great place. We recommend it wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"Big Bs was good all the way around. From the sweet tea (not too sweet) to the tri tip, we enjoyed it all. They serve big portions too. We had to get a to go container. My favorite things were the chicken, tri tip, fried okra and BBQ beans. They also sell Shiner Bock. My Texas heart was thrilled with this BBQ place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the three meat combo and a pitcher of shiner which came to about $30. I thought that it was a bit high but hopefully the food would justify the price..... nope.  Mac and cheese, good but it was a bit gritty. Probably from not cooking the roux enough but that at least says it's homemade so I'll take the grit.  Potato salad was pretty damn good. Definitely homemade and full of salady potatoey stuff.  Brisket was meh. Kinda bland. No dry rub that I could taste.  Hot link was great. Spicy and a great snap. Hopefully it's homemade.  Chicken was void of any seasoning. Looked great but really could use some salt on the skin. Great smoke taste though.  The staff was all very friendly and genuinely happy to help. The restaurant was clean and very open. Great for big parties.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but they are new and I wish them the best of luck being a local businesses. With time I'm hoping their smoker gets more seasoned as does their meat."}
{"text":"Only a couple times have I eaten at a highly yelp scored review, and totally disagreed with the average rating. This would be one of those cases! Between this and the new Bell's bbq up the street, this is some of the worst bbq I have ever experienced. Are the LVite's so deprived & ignorant to what great barbecue it that they feel this is good? It seems to me that before people open a restaurant it would be something they are good/great at making, and comfortable maintaining the quality for large numbers of people. These places need better brining & curing processes for taste & moisture, smoke quality & control, and knowing when to stop cooking! This is not food that is cooked to order folks, the expertise, control and cooking is supposed to be done ahead of time and reheated gently for your dining pleasure, or not. Dry, overcooked and tasteless should not be part of the process, not when your taking our hard earned dollars."}
{"text":"I'm happily trying to finish my 3 meat plate with sides of beans, cheese mac and cob corn. Way too much wonderful smoked meat of tri tip, brisket and turkey. Planning on round 2 by making a sandwich out of the wheat bread and leftover meat.  The ambience is American backyard with country music playing. Nice large 2 stall bathroom. They have sweet and unsweetened tea, too. Easy parking. Lots of picnic tables inside that can accomodate big parties.  They offer pickles,  pickled onions and vinegar jalapeno on the side. The beans were a zesty and spicy heat thick pot of beans. I enjoyed the beans but my pal couldn't take the heat. I thought the side servings are larger than other bbq joints. You can smell the smoker and hear the okra frying."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I love that they give you an option for more or less fat on your brisket. My new favorite for bbq!!"}
{"text":"A proper, welcoming, authentic Texas mom & pop BBQ joint right here in Henderson. Finally. Pulled pork is killer. Sides are strong. Service is friendly and prompt. If this place was around when Dave started, he wouldn't be Famous."}
{"text":"I love to see all of these new BBQ spots popping up in Henderson. It's also great that all of these places are local businesses! Vegas was seriously lacking in local business when I moved here and this area is definitely changing for the better in that regard.   Ever since living in Texas I have had a love of BBQ, especially Texas style. As soon as I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign I knew I'd be coming in to give this spot a try. Last night I finally made it in for a to go order after an appointment I had in the area.  This restaurant is huge! I loved the d√©cor with the picnic tables and little touches that make it feel like a Texas BBQ spot. As soon as you walk in you head left and down the hall to the start of the counter. They are definitely prepared for crowds. By the time I walked up to the counter someone was already waiting to take my order. The menu options are on a large board over the counter as well as a smaller version in front of your face while ordering. I appreciated the up close version of the menu since I always forget to bring my glasses.   The staff was very friendly and giving full attention to their customers. I definitely felt like they care about their business and their customers. My to go order came up in a timely manner with attention to making sure I had my preferred sauce and utensils if I needed them.   Since I'm on a diet (womp, womp) I ordered a three meat plate (comes with two sides) plus an additional small side for my husband and I to split. I opted for the half a rack of baby back ribs as one of my meats for a $4 upcharge. This order was definitely enough for two people to share.  Meats: Cheddar Jalapeno Sausage Links- juicy, cheesy, and hot. I loved these. Brisket-moist with a satisfying smoky flavor Baby Back Ribs- moist with a great smoky flavor  Sides: Creamed Corn- my favorite of the sides, great flavor  Baked Beans- loved that there were bits of veggie in here and the sauce was tasty Potato Salad- loved that it had egg and veggie mixed in, I enjoyed this, but be aware that this isn't a mayo loaded creamy potato salad  Sauce: I was given the option for sweet or spicy and chose sweet more for my husband. The sweet was good, but not my favorite BBQ sauce ever. Next time I'll definitely try the spicy sauce.   My first visit left a good enough impression for me to return. This is definitely a solid option for the area."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere with an extremely helpful and friendly staff. I got the 3 meat plate and I couldn't finish it! Great portion sizes, I would still get it again just to try more items. I got the brisket, tri-tip, and jalape√±o hot link All 3 are great. I also got the baked beans and Mac n cheese for my sides (I recommend both of those as well). I might have to try the corn next time though it looked really good. Very highly recommended for BBQ in the Las Vegas area AND they have shiner bock on tap! Which is not always available outside of Texas."}
{"text":"It started out okay then they sold me $40 worth of ribs with no meat but they replace them I didn't go back for a month now I'm back and they try to double charge me for my ribs the same exact order that I've been getting for $36 they tried to charge me $54"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here to try out Big B's and it was amazing and reasonably priced we both ordered 3 meat plates, I had the tri tip, pulled pork and hot link, he had the chicken, hot link and brisket.  Our sides were mac and cheese for both, he opted for their potato salad which he and I both loved, and I had the corn on the cob, corn was the only thing I wasn't thrilled about it was too overdone for me but everything else was great we will be back soon and tell our friends!"}
{"text":"Heard good things but this was my first visit. Even better than I was expecting! So happy to find real Texas BBQ this close to home. My favorites were the brisket, fried okra, beans, and the Turkey. If you ask, they will get you some special spicy BBQ sauce they don't have on the tables. Highly recommended. Very clean restaurant and a friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Some of the best smoked turkey and tri-tip I've had. Mac-n-cheese was on point. True southern potato salad. Only thing I wasn't fond of was the cornbread. Too sweet and not made with cornmeal? But otherwise this place was definitely worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by admitting that I knew very little about barbecue before I had a friend from Texas break it down for me. Every time I had experienced barbecue in the past from other places, either privately owned or chain restaurants, I felt like everything was drenched in sauce. Personally I'm not a big fan of this, I' want to taste the meat! At Big B's, I was quickly schooled that real barbecue is all about the seasoning and slow cooking. None of the meats come with sauce on them, instead they are perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sauces are served on the side. They have an extra spicy sauce that is amazing, but you have to ask for it. It's not left on the table. The meat was seriously the best barbecue I have ever had! I was told that the wood used for cooking imported from Texas, so clearly these people take their barbecue very serious... And I'm glad they do because I get to reap the rewards!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Period. I'm from San Antonio and Austin area and this is as close as it gets. Fried okra and brisket plus high quality iced tea...ding ding ding...winner for most authentic Texas bbq! And BEST brisket I've had in Las Vegas. I've tried every bbq place (even Rollin smoke) and am a straight up connoisseur of Texas BBQ so trust this review!!!"}
{"text":"We have tried all the BBQ places in town--- by far the best flavor! And they deliver!!! We will be back (or order delivery again)"}
{"text":"Carnivorous cravings satisfied here! The location is convenient for our mid week dinner meet ups, just behind St. Rose hospital. The staff is uber friendly and accommodating upon first coming in. The menu is straightforward and staff will make recommendations to optimize your value and dining experience...especially for first timers. The dining area is huge and looks like an indoor picnic ground. The food items are in a cafeteria style display to see as you walk to the back to place your order. They also have a separate take out area. 1 item combo with 1/2 rack baby back ribs and 2 small sides and 2 slices of bread ...$14.99 ($9.99 with $4 up charge for ribs) My daughter seemed to enjoy them as they fell right off the bones in a clean pile. 2 item combo with pulled pork $14.99 and 2 sides & bread. They gave us a mountain of pulled pork...plenty for 2 to share. The BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy and complimented the meat well. The staff was very thoughtful and kept checking in on us. I think this is a great place to get your BBQ fix in a quick, no-nonsense way."}
{"text":"Best bbq in LV in my opinion.  It's dependable every time, unlike some other LV bbq places.  This review is for the meat and staff only, side dishes / desserts were typical - mediocre.  I have been back and will make this a regular LV stop."}
{"text":"We just had the best BBQ and Smoked Baby Back Ribs we've ever eaten, and we've been to a lot of places. We were referred by a friend who eats there 2-3 times week and now we know why. We had baby back ribs, pulled pork, and beef brisket. It's worth a trip from the strip to St. Rose Parkway. Smokey taste, falls off the bone, and delicious sauces. Large servings, excellent service, comfortable atmosphere, affordable prices. We're coming back whenever we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"BBQ was great.  I did pick up but it looks like a great place to take the family.  I would definitely recommend coming here and trying it.  The sauce was little too sweet for me, but that is just personal preference.  I got brisket and chicken and both were awesome.  I also got the fried okra, cream corn and French fries, which were all great.  The menu is huge and when I went in, it was still early before dinner, around 4pm.  The service I received was very friendly and helpful since it was my first time there.  They have picnic tables and the usual paper towels on each table bc its after all, bbq!  It's located of St. Rose and you can see it from the street, so easy to find.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to let you know that my family ate at your restaurant Wednesday and I was very impressed by the staff and quality of your food! We had the family meal, and a slab of ribs. I am very particular of my barbecue and you did not disappoint us. The food was outstanding and your Ribs were the BEST I ever had. I run a restaurant in Caesars Palace and immediately told everyone how good it was! Thank you as you have a fine oiled machine and please don't change anything!! Thank you Randy Goldich  AGM Gordon Ramsay's Pub"}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of BBQ. A few friends wanted to try this place. It yelped well so I said why not. The worst BBQ decision I've ever made. The ribs were the driest I've ever had. I don't know how you can over cook beef and pork ribs due to their high fat content. But this place did exactly that. On a more positive note the moist brisket was exactly that. Moist.  I will never come back here."}
{"text":"OMG... Someone please loose my belt!!  Very good BBQ, BIG portions and it's impossible NOT to eat it all!!   You can't go wrong here.  Good atmoshphere and roomy."}
{"text":"I love this little gem. An authentic BBQ spot in my neighborhood. Family owned and operated. Big B's definitely scratches that BBQ fix.   Their pulled pork and chicken have the right amount of smoke paired with a mustard BBQ sauce that's to die for. The baby back ribsbfall off the bone and the texas hot links and french fries are also must order sides. Prepared for a food coma. The fries are an especially don't miss out on."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice.  The sides are good (beans, Mac-n-cheese) but the BBQ that brought us in was barely warm on my plate and cold on my wife's plate...brisket for her, brisket and ribs for me.  The BBQ sauce is ok but there aren't a lot of choices that we could find.  Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend.  We went here for lunch and of course after reading the reviews of friends on Yelp, I felt like it was a place we could probably enjoy.  Of course the BEST BBQ we have had was in Southern Texas in a little rink a dink town called Ozona in a small gas station converted to a restaurant.  Back to this place, you walk in and you feel like you are in a Texas place, all wooden picnic style tables with a few smaller 4 seat tables make out of cable reels but fixed up really nice.  The place was clean and you are led through a line to the counter where there is a menu posted on the glass and a guy taking your order.  The smell of the smoked style cooking hits you when you walk in the door and depending on the type of clothing you wear, (meaning if it absorbs smells, you will leave smelling like a smoke house, that's what you call wearing your lunch out and having it linger.  They have chicken, pork, brisket, tri-tip, turkey, and of course ribs, beef and pork.  You have a choice of 1, 2, or 3 meat plate or a smoked salmon.  You also have the option to purchase everything by the half pound or full pound if you want more and the ribs a half rack or full.  The baby backs are $26 for a full slab and $36 for the beef ribs.  I opted for the 3 meat plate and took the ribs, chicken and tri-tip.  I will have to go back to try the brisket.  It comes with 2 sides which there are 10 to choose from so if you don't like making choices, well just ask the person taking your order what their favorites are and they will be more then happy to tell you because they eat there as well.  For my sides I choose the BBQ Beans and Potato Salad.  I also took and order of corn bread, I love me some corn bread.  The ribs were good, pulled off the bone, the chicken was tender and very tasty, the tri-tip was dry but soft and adding some sauce to it which they have on the table made it enjoyable to eat.  The BBQ Beans and Potato Salad were both really really really good.  Neither one of use were offered or given a few slices of bread which another review stated he was offered and it does not say that on the menu so I am guessing he was special.  Next time I go back I will have to ask about that.  The staff are all very friendly and willing to help even after you sit down at the table with your food, they come by and make sure all is ok.  You can get beer, wine, they have an electronic soda machine which give you a lot of choices of drinks from caffeine free to low calorie to the full sugar me up kind.  They also have a separate selection of ice tea from sweet to unsweetened.    Overall I like this place, the sauces were good the food was good and the staff were amazing.  The corn bread was ok, it was more like a sweet cake.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Standard BBQ place. Good portion, descends taste.  I prefer the ribs slightly over the brisket. It was not like what I had in Texas, but good enough for its taste and price.?"}
{"text":"The ribs are delicious! Tender, grilled nicely on the outside & fall off the bone.  The baked beans are amazing...yes they were that good! My son is really picky and he loved the mac & cheese & pulled pork."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving day, rode our bikes to the M and won 200 bucks so bonus points for being open and we were in a good mood from winning......so  We only had the tri tip and the bbq beans. Delicious, their sauce is not too sweet and not too spicy....just right in my opinion. The mustard sauce at the table was the same. We'll be back and try some more, but our first impression is a 5."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and they were out of ribs so we tried other meats like the brisket, pork and chicken. All were delicious. Baked beans were some Of the best I have ever had! Only thing that could Be improved was the Mac and cheese. It was good but a little dry and the smokey flavor is terrible. Also could Service also was great !"}
{"text":"My first time. Stopped by yesterday late afternoon to pickup an order. Full rack of baby backs, two sides. The baby backs were excellent,, the meat fell right off the bone.  My girlfriend had the corn on the cob......again very good. I had the mac n cheese but just could not figure it out....not what I was used to.    Will probably come back again and try something different next time. Service was very fast.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The smell of BBQ smoke slaps you the face as you walk in and stays on your clothes after you leave. Not a bad thing, but you should be aware.  The amount of food you get for the price is more than reasonable. I was expecting small portions of meat for the tree meat combo, but I could not eat half of the food on my plate.  The sides are pretty good, my favorite were the baked beans. The brisket and pulled pork were very good. Also tried the tritip and pork ribs which were a little dry for me, but that's what the BBQ sauce on the table is for.  Nice place, good atmosphere, great prices. I'd definitely recommend a visit if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"Coming from North Carolina I didn't think BBQ could get any better but this food is even better than the BBQ at home. If anyone wants some good BBQ then I would recommend this 10/10"}
{"text":"Closest thing to \"Hill-Country\"cookin' you'll get this side of Kerrville....... Great ribs, sausage, and brisket.... And wonderful people. Texas attitude, and real south Texas mesquite smoke permeates the room.... Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue!  The chicken was phenomenal!  The sides are delicious... particularly the mac n cheese and the bbq beans!  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"BBQ and sides are very hard to rate due to everyone's personal preference and taste. We can all discuss KC, Memphis, St. Louis, Texas, etc... and have a different opinion. This place is nothing special, but it is good. It has good portions; the ribs and pulled pork are great. I do like the bbq sauce as my personal taste. The sides are decent, coleslaw, okra, potato salad. I do like the country bbq atmosphere with good country music playing.   However, they do need to work on their operational management, such as taking the order without the customer being able to look at the sides, the menu is too far away, food items coming to your table at different times (it is laid out very awkward).   If the owner is reading this, he needs to work on his pricing or he will be out of business soon. This is simple-easy-math. I can order the baby back ribs 1/2 slab for $14 or I can order the #1 meat plate with two sides for $9.99 (1/2 slab). I don't want to go into detail on the managerial accounting aspect, unless of course, you want to hire me."}
{"text":"I am a waste management truck driver in the fine city of Las Vegas. I drive around the city 14hours four days a week. Big B's is on my route every Thursday. I really look forward to have lunch here every Thursday. Allow me to start with the amazing Bbq. It's . But I'm here because their customer service is above par!!!  The ambiance is appealing and comfortable. Price is average not to expensive but not cheap either. All in all, the food worth every penny. I'm not a Texas fan not from their. I will highly recommend this Big B's with exuberance."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ!   Came here at 2pm one Saturday afternoon. Wasn't crowded but busy.   Husband and I shared a 3 meat plate - got the beef ribs (upcharge $5), pulled pork, and the brisket. (As a rule, you must always order a brisket as one of your meats.)  When ordering, we were asked if we want more meat or fat with the brisket (the right answer is fat).   Ribs did not disappoint (worth the upcharge), but the brisket needed more fat (maybe I have to ask for *extra* fat next time). Pulled pork was delicious too. Got the fries and mac and cheese as our sides and we devoured the entire thing.   It seems all the meat was smoked/cooked in-house and the place is super clean.   I always check the bathroom (I think it reflects the cleaniness of the place) and that was clean too.   Would give that last star if they had a fixin's station/section/table - definitely worth the visit - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Anyone familiar to the Vegas/Henderson area knows we have been lacking good BBQ. I'd like to thank Brian (owner) for choosing the location. I know the cost of having a business in Vegas/Henderson is more expensive to maintain than the country convenience down south specifically in Texas and Louisiana where sometimes ownership of business and land has been handed down for generations. In Nevada the cost of wood and general lack of authentic ingredients is also an obstacle and understandably the price is factored into the menu.  I'm originally from Texas and my family knows about Kreuz Market in Lockhart (TX), Meyer's Elgin Smokehouse in Elgin (TX), and Zimmerhanzel's Bar-B-Que in Smithville (TX) which was just sold after 36 years of business, but reopening soon if anyone is traveling down to that neck of the woods.  My recommendation is for everyone to support Big B's BBQ. It is a new establishment and it will take some time for such things, i.e. tweaking the menu for the likes of locals. I think menu prices will stabilized when the best economic suppliers are found. The staff is super kind and the place is really clean. So instead of losing another twenty bucks in a slot machine, take a break and treat yourself to something more worthwhile. It's good eats for the whole family.  Now about the BBQ! My wife had the pork ribs plate and it was excellent.The ribs might be my favorite on the menu as well. I had a po'boy with the brisket upgrade. What would a southern style BBQ place be without good brisket?! Well the brisket did not disappoint...it is good! I'd prefer a baguette for the po'boy but the soft dough bread used was still good. I have not tried the sausage yet, but will when I get the opportunity. Down south, the sausage is eaten separately on a plate or in what we call wraps or a wrap around, which is found on many BBQ joint menus  (basically bread wrapped around sausage with BBQ sauce). Btw the BBQ sauce used at Big B's BBQ is really good. I'd like to see a hot BBQ sauce added to the selection.   Next about the sides! Now this is where personal taste comes into play and I know depending on the region of the U.S. a person is originally from that tastes do vary. Personally I tend to like food more spicy. My favorite side is the beans. My wife liked the corn on the cob. I thought the coleslaw could of used a more tangy component and be slightly sweeter as well. I think the mac & cheese was good but needed a smokier taste, perhaps some bacon added. The mac and cheese will be a hit with the kids. My grandma used to fry okra, green tomatoes, and squash. I'll have to give the fried okra a try next visit to see if it matches up.  Condiments. Well here is where a few inexpensive additions would be greatly appreciated. Please consider replacing the hot sauce brand you currently use with Tabasco, Crystals, Louisiana Hot Sauce, or Trappey's brand. These are the more authentic popular table and BBQ joint brands used in Texas and Louisiana.   Desserts? I have a few suggestions. I think peach cobbler, pecan pie, banana pudding, cr√®me brule'e, leche flan, and/or cheesecake would all be tasty treats. Maybe even a soft serve ice cream machine in the future for the kids.  Overall this a really good place to enjoy BBQ. Serving portions are adequate. I've met Brian (the owner) and I can tell you that he works hard to bring satisfaction to the public."}
{"text":"This BBQ place is great! I've tried the turkey, ribs, pulled pork, beans and Mac n cheese.... all the meat is tender and fresh, the Mac n cheese is amazing!! Love the mustard BBQ sauce:)"}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 meat meal and got more then enough protein. BBQ beans had big chunks of meet and the corn bread was soft and sweet, Everything was o so tasty!"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ for Vegas standards. I like Bama BBQ better. Pulled pork was too salty. Brisket was ok. Ribs are hit and miss depending on the day. Some days this place is great, some days not so much."}
{"text":"I'm from the \"South\" so I know BBQ. This place is good for Vegas but not for Texas, Tennessee, other great BBQ states. The tri-tip is good but it didn't have the red exterior depth that great BBQ has, especially with brisket. Ribs are good dry rub but not as moist as they could be. The sides are amazing. The potato salad is extremely good. The cream corn is fresh corn not frozen or canned. The side portions are large so plan on having extra. Maybe you need a humid climate for great BBQ. Maybe they cook it hotter than the slow cookers of the South. But, again, this is the best place I've found in Vegas. Try it."}
{"text":"Gotta update my last review......called in an order for pick up.  It was ready quick.  The Ribs were excellent.  Chicken very good too.  I was glad to see the place was packed, which is great to see from a non chain resturaunt.  Only thing from getting 5 stars is the price of the ribs.....god knows I love ribs but 15 bucks for half a slab which kinda looked like less then half a slab is a lil much.  Oh yea almost forgot my last review I said the mac and cheese was bland and they must of changed it because I really liked it this time...Great BBQ in Henderson."}
{"text":"Smoked brisket and smoked turkey are delicious, beans have great flavor so does the Mac and coke slaw. Very good food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After picking up my wife at a nearby spa, we made the short drive to Big B's for lunch.  I had a coupon from a zip code magazine, good for a free pulled pork sandwich w/one side upon spending $10.  We ordered 2 pulled pork sandwiches which included a total of 3 sides plus a soda.  The soda machine was being temperamental so we started off with a 1/2 glass of sweet tea which way to sweet for our tastes.  In the meantime, our pulled pork sandwiches served on a large roll arrived. The portion size of pulled pork was very generous, and the meat proved to be both tender and delicious. My wife enjoyed the mac and cheese side and devoured the baked bean with the 3rd side, coleslaw, largely ignored."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town and I've tried them all. A bit on the high side, but what BBQ isn't. Good atmosphere, good food, staff was nice too. What more could you want? An ice cold beer, they had that too!"}
{"text":"25 minutes waiting for my food. I had to two people ask me for my name & yet it seemed like nobody was working on my order because it was a to-go. It seems like they tend to the people who dine in instead. Plus what was more irritating was that my food was ready and the girl just placed it down to go refill silverware by the drinks. & then someone who came 10 minutes after me and ordered way more than I did got their food before I did. Pretty upsetting."}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ we've ever had!! The brisket fell apart it was so tender! The sides were great too!! You can't go wrong with this place! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday, really enjoyed the environment. A good place to catch the Sunday football games. The food was on point, pretty much tried everything & it was amazing. Great customer service also!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Second time here and.......wow! Great food, great customer service, absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"Large portions and the food was delish. I ate the tri tip and was sooo yummy. The owner offered us samples of the meat great southern hospitality."}
{"text":"This was place was awesome! The service was great staff is really friendly! You also get to try samples of the meat to help figure out what you want to order. The set up is really nice and love the benches as tables, feels like you're in your own backyard. The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is cause my favorite thing to have at bbq places is cornbread. They have a choice for cornbread which is an extra $1.50 but just prepare to have a cinnamon muffin rather than corn bread. Overall tho the food is amazing, the meat is absolutely delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the mac and cheese I'll prob get another side next time."}
{"text":"****REVISED*** Two stars for friendliness and helpfulness of employees. No ratings for the food. I have read reviews of those who loved it and some not so much.... opinions are subjective. Based on my living is South Texas for many years and comparing this food to my experience with Texas BBQ, this is not \"Texas\" BBQ."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ and for a great price. I had the three meat plate for under $20!!! The tri tip, was good, the smoked turkey was soft and delicious and the brisket, OMG! Melt in your mouth perfection. The beans are also perfect, can't wait to try your Mac &cheese. Good job!"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday to support local businesses, what a great choice! People working there are super helpful when it comes to figuring out quantity and what to order. Everything was great, our kiddos loved the Mac n cheese, we gravitated towards the brisket and baby back ribs. The tea is swell too!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at Big B's, and not once have we been disappointed! I usually get a 1 or 2 meat plate, my boyfriend gets the brisket poboy. Pulled pork, moist brisket, and tri tip are all perfectly smoked and cut to order. None of this sitting in a vat of juices and fat for unknown amounts of time. All of the sides are delicious, our favorites are the Mac and cheese, pasta salad, and fresh cut fries. Also, the potato skins (on the secret menu) are a MUST try! I always leave full, and with lunch for the next day. Not to mention, all staff are friendly and service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Very delish and authentic BBQ! We love this place,  I ordered delivery tonight and it came quick and on time.  Yes pricey but worth it! ! Goood ribs and brisket. Sweet and warm corn bread muffins! Thank you Big B's!"}
{"text":"The Hubs and I decided to give this place a try. The food was delicious! The brisket and ribs were lean, not fatty. The sides were good too. We will definitely be back. The prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly. The only issue was that we ate too much!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My son and I eat here almost everyday!!! The food reminds me of the amazing food that my family in Texas make and the employees are so nice!!!!! Every time we come in they all play with my son!!!! And if I need help they always do as much as they can. The owner is always there to and he is awesome!! He always checks on my son and I. The environment is awesome!! And so is their Mac n cheese and fries (that's all my son will eat right now, refuses any other food) everyone should defiantly go.   Its my new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the tri tip, brisket, smoked turkey and chicken along with the creamed corn, Mac & cheese, fries and cornbread! All were delicious! Definitely coming back! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great Texas style BBQ, down the street from where I live. So is very convenience for me and it tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch atmosphere second to none was really excited to try this place. I ordered half pound brisket half a rack of ribs. The ribs were tender but lukewarm at best not much flavor disappointing. The brisket on the other hand was very tender very tasty but very very fatty. Unfortunately i've been on the potty ever since I think it had something to do with the cold ribs. I don't think I'll be back can't chance it bummer such a cool place. It's also very very expensive"}
{"text":"Worst barbeque ever.  No flavor to the sauce.  Sides either mushy or under cooked.  Would NEVER GO BACK. Not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but not the best Q we've had but would go back for a second try. Very friendly staff. Owner takes her business seriously, responded to my review very quickly. To be respected for sure."}
{"text":"Tried Big B's for the first time and ordered the beef ribs with cream corn and Mac and cheese. My wife wasn't overly hungry and just ordered a \"salad\". Typically beef ribs are big and meaty. These ribs came out over-cooked and very small. They were mostly bone and had very little meat. For $17 I was surprised there were only 4 small bones. The Mac and cheese was flavorless and the creamed corn tasted like it came right out of a Del Monte can. My wife's salad consisted( $8.99) literally of a mound of lettuce with two small containers of ranch dressing. The food was served directly on plastic cafeteria trays with plastic silverware. There were no plates on the tray and combined with the plastic silverware it made it difficult to cut the ribs without the tray sliding around. I am all for new restaurants in our area and understand a place being new, but in this case the most important part, the food, made a very poor first impression."}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket, mac and cheese, beans and cornbread. The brisket had as much fat as meat and the taste was the same, if not worse than some of the chain bbq places in town. The beans were ok  and the mac and cheese tasted like a watered down version of Kraft."}
{"text":"Ordered this through postmates on a whim and omg is it crazy delicious amazing bomb BBQ explosion in your mouth!!! Bets BBQ I've had in Vegas and I'm so glad I finally found a place that knows how to make tri tip correctly. Seriously. God bless you people.  Sincerely, Your newest addict"}
{"text":"Their beef ribs and Mac and Cheese are delicious. We like the corn muffins too. Chocolate cake and lemon cake top off a great meal there. Thanks Natalia and her staff."}
{"text":"The Foooooooood is awesome and the owner and the service is WONDERFUL, It was 18 of us and the owner was on top of things...  Thanks Alot... Chocolate M. Thunder ~"}
{"text":"Had Easter dinner with my hubby considering it's close to our house. I was super excited that it said Texas BBQ considering I'm a Texas girl myself who misses her hometown comfort foods. We arrived around 7:30pm in the evening and it was less crowded. I enjoyed the Texas ambiance which really made me feel like I was at home. We ordered a rack of their ribs, brisket, and hot links. Granted we arrived later in the evening, the ribs were dry and I had to add a lot of their BBQ sauce too moisten it. However, their BBQ sauce was tasty. The BBQ beans were okay (tasted better when I added sauce), mac n cheese was just ok, fried okra was probably my favorite side I tried. The corn bread didn't taste homemade, more store bought. Maybe it's me, I'm used to baked hot Texas cornbread cut in huge squares. Oh yeah, the smoked brisket was good, considering it went well with their BBQ sauce. Surprisingly the hit was the hot links, which was nice and spicy.  I'll make another visit for lunch to try their other items for consistency and the hot links. They always have coupons in the mail. I used one for our dinner."}
{"text":"Great bbq, and the best french fries ever! Very casual, stand in line to order, big picnic tables. Very friendly staff and affordable. Great place to take a group."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ in Vegas!!!  You can't beat this incredible bbq meal... stopped off here on my way to downtown vegas from LA and couldn't be happier with the overall experience and taste for real authentic bbq. The best! Thank you ;)"}
{"text":"I was hankering for some BBQ on the way from running errands and decided to try Big B's again!   The last time I did not have a great experience and I wanted to try it out again.  This time, my son and I ordered:  1.  Tri Tip 2.  Beef Link 3.  Brisket - Moist Cut 4.  Half Chicken.  The experience this time was absolutely awesome.  The Tri-Tip was so tender and juicy moist. I had asked the order taker if he recommended the Tri-Tip of the pulled pork.  Thankfully, I listened to him and it was the best.   The moist cut Brisket was so tender. I really think it is the best in LV.  I stopped using fork and knife and went all hands as it was the best way to eat this stuff, faster than my son...  The chicken is the dark meat, leg and thigh.  So juicy and the meat is perfect as it falls off the bone.  The Beef Link had the right amount of spicy kick to it and I am glad I ordered it as I always wanted to try it.  Service was great, food was great and I am glad that they have their greatness back.  GK says, definitely go back.  The best thing was, i ordered all this at the end of the day toward closing and all the food was perfect, juicy, tender and moist.  So glad I came back here!"}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite BBQ spot in Vegas! The food here is delicious!   I ordered the 2 meat plates (pulled pork and brisket) with a side of beans and mac and cheese. This was perfection on a plate! The pulled pork and brisket were very flavorful and tender. I ordered the beans because of other yelpers' reviews who claimed they were the best...and they were not mistaken.   The mac and cheese is very cheese and gooey. It also has a hefty amount of pepper which I loved and it did not make it too spicy. I also really liked that they had Shiner beers here. That is the best drink to accompany bbq.   I lived in Texas for 3 years and I have to say this is place is legit. I plan on coming here a lot more often.   PS: There were a lot of people when I visited during dinner time on a Friday. The service was fast though!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Vegas! Food was amazing and the service even better. A must go to place :)"}
{"text":"Had to try Texas BBQ as we don't have any good bbq in the area. The service was very fast and friendly. I ordered the half rack with bbq beans and pasta salad Both in the smallest size. Skipped the bread as I'm not a bread eater and i don't need the carbs. Next time I'll just order one side..most likely the beans. The portion size of the ribs was overwhelming...falling off the bones tender...but a little greasy...therefore 4 stars rather than 5 stars. I would recommend Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food and I would love to see the following fixed: 1. The order process is not great and get messed up our order,  I'm going to guess they mess up several orders per day.  2. Not much for kids options,  no small portions. I'd love to see chicken fingers and corn dogs.  I'd love to see a single slider with small side kids combo with drink.   3. $2.25 for fountain soda is highway robbery  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I set aside their coupon on several occasions but finally went last night. Wow! The meats were on par with Lucille's. The sides were better.  The staff made recommendations and everyone was very friendly.  As we ate we were thinking of which neighbors we could bring back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice surprise! The BBQ is smoked perfectly and the sides are a perfect match. They have fried okra, the only place that we have found in the valley!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas craving some Texas BBQ Brisket - Found this hidden gem off the strip.  The Brisket is amazing- The Smoked Turkey is amazing - the Ribs Rock- as a former Houston Astro Baseball player, this place is TEXAS in VEGAS !!!  Cream Corn is amazing - grab a Shiner Bock and enjoy Texas Grub in VEGAS !!!  The Staff is amazing as well. Great customer service!!  BIG B and Family did it right !!"}
{"text":"I had the one meat plate for $9.99 but had to pay an up-charge of $5 to make it pork ribs.  My Ribs were charred so much on top they were black and had a burnt taste. No sauce and couldn't taste any rub, seasoning or flavor at all. The corn on the cob was so cooled off I couldn't even melt the butter on it. Hubby had brisket. For $14.00 he got 3 slices and they were super fatty. Would not go again. For what you pay you can get much better in town. I've eaten BBQ in Texas and this wasn't even close. Will stick to Dickey's for fast food style BBQ."}
{"text":"Tri tip and brisket!!!! Yummy very good and moist. The service is great and it smells very good inside. Come try it guys"}
{"text":"Tri-tip was insanely good and the roast turkey was our second fav!! The fried okra is a must try and love, love, love their fries- yummy!!"}
{"text":"Updated review:   Another visit to Big B's and another amazing dinner.  Place just keeps getting better and that's hard to do with how perfect the bbq is and don't forget some of the best sides you'll ever have in your life.      Previous review :  This place is sooooo amazing. Absolutely the best BBQ in The Valley vegas or Henderson.  Can't be beat!  The food is excellent, the staff is friendly, everything is just top notch.   I have started eating here at least once a week and I love it."}
{"text":"The best places are those who know your name walking in through the door.  While the owners of Big B's were unknown to me until our second visit, the smell of a authentic BBQ is like a warm, aromatic hug accompanied by a soft, determined whisper, 'Let's eat'.  My wife and I pulled Natalia aside - we guessed correctly that she was the Co-owner.  Having sold to full service restaurants in the past, you can quickly tell the difference by the way the owners genuinely care for their customers.  Her husband is a towering figure - his giant presence is living breathing proof that they grow 'em big in Texas. He and Natalia are a perfect couple who bring their joy of BBQ to this little corner of Las Vegas and it shows in true Texan fashion.  Natalia explained.  Original BBQ doesn't cut corners.  Their briskets smoke for 12-14 hours overnight.  Only fresh meat, only seasoned rub - no marinade, and Texas mesquite.  Every few months they drive to Texas to haul cords of genuine Texas mesquite back to B's adoptive home of 20 years.    If you love BBQ, go here.  They don't advertise.  They don't need to.  This place is packed.  Friday nights, their special are the beef ribs.  Go early - they run out quickly to high demand.  This is a no joke, best of the best"}
{"text":"Big B's BBQ boasts the ambience of a real backyard BBQ, including the smoky stench you'll leave with afterwards.  Employees were friendly, but the food here was just A-Ok.   Items tried: Brisket Tri-tip Mac n cheese Creamed corn Baked beans Potato salad  I preferred the tri-tip over the brisket in the flavor department, but I appreciated the tenderness of the brisket. The meat was kind of dry side and absolutely needed sauce. I was a bit disappointed that the tables offered only one kind of BBQ sauce.  It wasn't bad, just didn't have the wow factor. The mustard sauce at the table was tasty, but didn't really go with the meats we had.   The sides were pretty good. I liked the baked beans the best and the creamed corn the least.   I'm glad I got to finally try this place since I was nearby for an appointment. It was the most reasonable fast, casual food option that didn't have a drive thru in the immediate area. I will have to tackle on the pork options at a next visit. Looking forward to some ribs, pulled pork, and hot links!   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 31/100"}
{"text":"It's summer, and that means enjoying good BBQ and ice cold beer in the 110F oven.  Oh yeah.   Note:  There is a wonderfully aromatic indoor dining room filled with communal picnic benches and rolls of paper towels (cool) but BBQ somehow taste better in the great outdoors.   Big B's fits the bill in Vegas if you've got a hankering for some low and slow flavors of Texas but let's just say, this ain't Lockhart or Austin.  I'm not gonna criticize a pitmaster's passionate art so let's just say, my personal preferences don't line up but hey, food here is solid.   Note:  All meats sold by the pound,  1/2 or full rack or as part of a plate.    Brisket (fat end) - Good smoke ring, decent bark with a simple rub, clean smoke flavor with no acrid finish.  I prefer brisket to quiver as it's being sliced, juicier, where pieces are just barely able to support their own weight when held between your fingers.  Beef ribs - Clean smoky flavor, tender, and satisfying.  I do prefer three inches of juicy, quivering meat on my bones (See Blacks BBQ in Lockart) but this is A-OK.  Pork ribs - Clean smoke flavor, nice rub that definitely brings out the flavor of the pork.  Well trimmed with membrane removed prior to the rub being applied.  Tender and relatively moist.  No complaints.  Beef sausage - it is.  Not memorable but no complaints.  Sides - None sampled.  Can't afford to waste stomach space when chowing down on good BBQ cow and pig.    Sauces - None sampled.  Who the heck uses sauce on BBQ from Texas anyway.  Very friendly, no nonsense service.  Prices in line.  All told, very satisfying belly busting grub."}
{"text":"Big B's provides a bit of Texas flare with a spacious restaurant with country vibes, picnic tables, and enticing aromas to get my appetite rolling. I can smell the smokey goodness as I walked up on the sidewalk, a sure sign of a genuine barbecue.  I ordered the two meat plate the Brisket and Pulled Pork, along with two sides pasta salad and the BBQ beans. The Brisket tasted good despite being a little dry for my taste. The pulled pork was deliciously moist and packed smokey flavor. As for the sides, the BBQ beans was awesome with it's chunks of meat, full of sweet and tangy flavor.  The have a nice selection of flavorsome BBQ sauces, with the spicy being my favorite it makes everything shine.  Overall the service was great, the staff is nice and attentive. The prices are very reasonable, especially the sandwiches it's perfect for lunch on a budget.   I enjoyed my experience at Big B's, much better than the lackluster BBQ spots around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to rival Rollin Smoke in the Henderson area, if you are too, this is not the BBQ you're looking for.  I was torn, I really would rate is 2.5, but for the sake of it being a new business I'll round up. I got the three meat plate, brisket and pulled pork and  upgraded one meat to a half slab for $4.  It's decent, but not flavorful enough for me. Maybe it's the type you have to drown in BBQ sauce (they offer a mustard based and a ketchup based, of the two I prefer the ketchup based) and I only got one of each to go.  I like my brisket on the verge of falling apart and this wasn't tough, but it wasn't about to fall apart either. The ribs were fall off the bone so that's a plus to me.  The mac N Cheese is excellent, better than most BBQ spots. The creamed corn is good too.  I always try a BBQ place twice so hopefully the second time is better than the first. More flavor in the spice rubs please!"}

{"text":"We ate there today and everything was AMAZING!!  When u first walk in you smell the amazing smell of BBQ!! All them employees were friendly and easy to talk to!!  Everyone needs to check this place out!!  The sauces on the table were great and mine fave was the mustard one!!! The pulled pork,  tri tip and brisket were my great but my favorite had to be the jalape√±o and cheese sausage!!! All I can say is it is a MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place but I was totally not impressed. Ordered brisket, it was ok lot of fat then half side ribs   They were dry like they were cooked days ahead. Beans had a funny flavor like I never tasted before maybe vinegar nasty. Potato salad had no taste lotsa bell pepper tasted  like flat potato n bell pepper. BBQ sauce they have two kinds one a red. Sauce was not good. The other a mustard based also large on vinegar. Tried it once never again too bad I wanted to like the place."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices nice big dining area. Brought some friends to try it out and was not dissapointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in with a friend during our trip to Las Vegas since we were craving some good smoked BBQ. When we walked in, we were offered a sample of the brisket while waiting in line and it pretty much melted in my mouth! My husband and I ordered the 3 meat plate with tri-tip, brisket, and pulled pork with baked beans and fries as our sides. Our friend got the ribs and tri-tip with cream corn and beans. All were so yummy! The meats were very tender and flavorful without the need for any BBQ sauce (although the 2 BBQ sauces they had were very tasty). I didn't have the bread but the boys didn't complain about it being stale. Big B came to our table while we were eating to check in on us and introduce himself. He is such a sweet man and we are proud of his accomplishment! We all washed our meals down with some delicious sweet tea and called it a night. We definitely will be back for more the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Smells amazing when you walk in the door. We were hungry before going but smelling the food when we walked I made me starving lol. Ribs awesome, pulled pork delicious and brisket tasty. Had sides of Mac and cheese, BBQ beans, fried okra and corn on the cob. All yummy. Great to find a good BBQ place in Henderson. Recommend to anyone who loves BBQ. Will be going back."}
{"text":"great texas bbq! one of the best spots in town. owned by cool nightclub industry folks show your support!"}
{"text":"My BFF and I were looking for a new place around home.  We just happen to see the sign from the road and thought we would give it a try.  We each ordered the 2  meat plate which comes with two sides. He ordered chicken and tri-tip with mac & cheese and bbq beans for his sides. I ordered pulled pork and brisket, with coleslaw and bbq beans as my sides.  We each ordered a side of cornbread. When ordering the brisket I was asked if I would like it lean or moist. Anybody who has had brisket will know the difference! I ordered the moist which has more fat thus giving it more flavor. We were very pleased with the quality of food and the generous portions. The coleslaw is outstanding, and I consider myself somewhat of  coleslaw snob!  Unfortunately they had run out of cornbread and offered us either an additional side or a refund of our money. We each ordered an additional side. I had Mac & cheese and he had French fries. The owner came by the table to see if everything is okay and I told him they were out of cornbread, which was disappointing as I love good cornbread. He seemed genuinely miffed at the fact that they had run out stating that should never have happened and apologized profusely. The atmosphere is pleasant, Comfortable and friendly. He has hired on a great staff who seem to take the job seriously and genuinely care about a positive guest experience. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The meats in my brisket plate (moist cut) and David's turkey sandwich were both top notch - great BBQ. I liked the mac n cheese a lot, very creamy and cheesy. The bbq beans were done very well, nice smoky flavor, but I just found them way too sweet and couldn't finish them. David said the potato salad was pretty generic. I would definitely go here again for the meats alone."}
{"text":"this place is legit !!! all meats are spot on but the sides are where its at !! best beans ever .. ever  !!"}
{"text":"went here for the first time NEVER again!!! the workers specially the manager dont have customer service they dont say hi when u come in they dont say bye when u leave  im very disappointed with the food! we order baby back ribs it was very dry yuck!!! the cornbread are hard and taste and look like they made it from a box of mixed corn bread ( dont believe its from scratch) nasty!!! we also order bbq beans not good either! taste like they just put bbq sauce that they use for the ribs the one on the table  plus we also ordered tri tips also very hard and dry! now i understand why when we came there theres only one customer eating... i been to alot of southern restaurant and this the only place i didnt like. what a waste of money  plus we also put tip. never again!!! i should have just went to LUCILLE'S like i always do!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't found much to be excited about in BBQ places around Henderson. Then I stumbled onto Big B's, not only is it close by, but I'd drive a ways to eat here. The first thing that hits you as you walk in is the aroma, something good is cooking. The tough part is then deciding what smells so good that you don't want to order the wrong thing. After numerous visits I can say it's all as good as it smells! If you've been eating ribs at chain restaurants you'll wonder how Big B's finds pigs with more than twice the meat. It's not fancy but it shouldn't be, good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Dang. I was crazy disappointed and the IG hype wasn't real. I wanted it to be! But alas... Man, I hate writing these reviews.   I happened to be on this side of town with T to do his cake tasting at Freed's. We decided to stop in for lunch since we were on that side of the valley for once. I'd been really looking forward to giving this place a shot after seeing a few of my IG Foodie friends post some delicious looking BBQ.   We ordered the 3 meat combo and got the tri tip, brisket (both lean and regular) and paid the $5 up charge for a half rack of pork ribs. Our sides were Mac and cheese and fries.  Everything had the day old leftover taste and appearance. The Mac and cheese was dry. I understand it's more of the home style Mac and cheese, but it wasn't very cheese-y. A majority of the fries were soggy, I'd say about 90% of them and were obviously not fresh and ruled inedible by the fry king. The thing he hates most is soggy fries. He (we) barely touched them or the Mac and cheese.   The meat, all of the cuts except for the regular brisket (which was on the mushy side) were dry. The lean brisket was real decent. The tri tip? Dry. You can see the dry spots in my attached photo. Ribs? Also dry. I wasn't surprised because of the super thick bark on it. They also weren't as meaty as other local BBQ spots I've tried Collectively, there was the telltale bitter, over-smoked taste that lingered.. Sad face.   The customer service was real great for us personally and the establishment is super clean with lots of TV's."}
{"text":"The girls at the counter were very nice but the food itself was very average. The brisket was moist but lacked flavor, the cornbread was dry. My wife said the ribs and Mac and cheese were average. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ - best in Henderson IMO - randomly saw them on the way to visit CA and it made the drive alot better."}
{"text":"Hands down anytime I get back to vegas from working in OMNIA San Diego and a BBQ craving hits I head strength to the best BBQ Place in vegas @BigBzBbQ the staff is amazing but the food is what will keep you coming back Tri Tip full of juicy flavor and Mac N Cheese so cheesy you'll leave with a full belly and smile  Texas Big Bs BBQ"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was very disappointing. I ordered a 2 meat plate to share with tri tip and brisket. The tri trip was very bland and the brisket was hard. The corn was okay and the Mac and cheese was definitely the last of an old batch of Mac and cheese, it wasn't creamy at all. The corn bread was probably the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Very good food ! This was my second time there. We had a variety of food ordered for pick up. I got there early and after a couple of mins they had all my food ready to go. All there nothing left out and extra sauce.   Met Brian the owner, nice man nice BBQ joint. Definitely going back !"}
{"text":"welcome to Big B's Texas BBQ. As you walk in its a counter style BBQ joint with picnic tables to sit on. You order your food and they make it as you sidle on down the counter to the end where you pay for your grub. We shared the meat platter. Pork, trii tip, and brisket. Pork was had a great smoke to it and had a great flavor. Their house sauce was the best we tried and it added the tang I was expecting from a good sauce. Brisket pulled apart nicely and had a good ring and deep flavor. Now I am not normally a fan of smoked tri tip because it is not easy to get tender after a long smoke, they succeeded and it was really good. We had slaw which was more on the vinegar side than I like but it was crisp and gave the balance needed. BBQ beans were good and Mac and Cheese was just average.    Thanks for Dining at Big B's Texas BBQ. We would go back and try the other meats and deserts. If in Henderson and need a BBQ fix give it a try."}
{"text":"This is the BEST BBQ place in Las Vegas by far!!!! I'm from Texas so I should know! Definitely coming back next week for more!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times now, but with mixed results.  Pleasantly, this time was quite good. I ordered the tri- tip with beans and Cole slaw as my sides - a Number 2 plate in their menu terminology.   The half pound portion of beef was sliced thin which helped make it fork tender to eat and was moist and delicious. The beans were served piping hot and had abundant chunks of burnt ends mixed in a combo of two or three types of beans. One drawback for me was the sauce for the beans was overly sweet - I would like to see a spicy version offered with jalape√±os and a less sugar based sauce. Cole slaw was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Henderson's little secret. Got the family style: baby back ribs, tri-tip, chicken, corn on the cob, pasta salad and beans. So delicious!"}
{"text":"REAL TALK- are portions are Fabulous! The meat is TENDER! The bread is soft and the sides are plentiful. We are giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because:The BBQ sauce is pretty thin. Other than that, the ladies that took the order & at the checkout counter were friendly, and the place was spotless. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Love the BBQ here. Everyone that works here is super friendly and I love their sauces. Definitely recommend eating here for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This is Texas barbecue?   If so, I am not impressed. Where is the smoke?  There is no bark, and that means it was not smoked much, if at all. Without the sauce there is no taste.  And where are the condiments?  No pickles and no onions, and only one sauce.  The fried okra is good, so it was not a complete failure.  The PBR draft was cold, too.  Not enough here for a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! Had a ton of questions about catering a lunch and Big Brian the Owner was so patient with me. A true gentle GIANT!! All around an amazing experiance. I love that they do not put the sauce on the meat already (for all you fellow low-carb people)"}
{"text":"Love it! This is a very good BBQ spot! The brisket is to die for, the restaurant has a very cool vibe, and there is plenty of room.  Did I mention how good the food is?! This is a must try."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef hot link, beef jalape√±o and cheese hot link, pulled pork, brisket, tri tip, pork loin, creamed corn, potato salad and mac & cheese.... Food and service is absolutely amazing!!! The service is exceptional as well!!"}
{"text":"Going all-in for Southern Cuisine on Sunday it was with Barbeque on the brain that five diners sat down at Big B's Texas BBQ for dinner, Brian Buechner and Natalia Badzjo's little piece of the Lone Star State at 3019 St. Rose Parkway once again outperforming anything else found locally when it comes to Smoked Meat.  At this time two-years in and still making new fans, any opportunity to steer catering their way likely to result in the best workplace lunch any co-worker can recall, it was just as the clock struck 6:00pm with Country tunes playing overhead that an order was placed, Drinks from a Coke Remix Machine plus Beer filled and a new roll of paper towels gathered for a table that knew they'd need it.  Busier than earlier visits on Saturdays around the hour of opening, Natalia present taking orders and bussing tables as a familiar crew tended to Meats and Sides, it was perhaps five minutes after seating that tray one arrived laden with Sin City's creamiest Cream Corn and BBQ Beans better than even Texas' top smokehouses, the fresh-baked Mac n' Cheese again better than in the past thanks to a bit more salt while Potato Salad was a big hit for the diner who always orders it.  Burning through the last pile of wood driven up from Texas, the Oak's smoke and a perfume of Paprika and Pepper hanging in the air, those who follow @bigbzbbq on Instagram will know that Big B's Texas BBQ doesn't quit at just what is listed on the overhead menu, an order of Potato Skins loaded with Pulled Pork, Cheddar Cheese, Green Onions, Sour Cream and Jalapenos undoubtedly one of the best \"secret menu\" items in Sin City while the hand-cut Spuds fried in Peanut Oil also make for some very respectable French Fries.  Still working on all the Appetizers, Sides and moist Cornbread Muffins as five styles of Meat arrived, portions of each perfect for the group, it should go without saying that any trip to a Texas BBQ joint should not be without Brisket, the smoke-ringed Lean version and Fatty cuts each impressing their audience while a snappy Sausage and two styles of Ribs were equally well prepared, the smaller-than-usual Beef duo actually a bit better bargain than the Jumbo specimens Brian and Natalia sometimes offer as guests aren't paying s much for the Bone's weight.  Further enchanting visitors with housemade Sauces, though purists will likely prefer the simple Dry Rub atop Meats not compromised by fillers or preservatives, it was with stomachs full and sports playing on Television that dinner came to a conclusion with two hefty wedges of Cake, the group's ten year old and a confirmed Chocoholic making short work of one studded with Chocolate Chips beneath Fudge while others quickly devoured a Lemon version that *seems* lighter thanks to the tangy Citrus Glaze."}
{"text":"Went in on Father's Day. I knew it would be busy which is to be expected. The staff were very busy and working extra hard! Decided to order take out so placed our order then kept following the line paid for my order. Order with tip was about $50.00 dollars for myself and another person. Upon leaving the restaurant I checked out my order in the car noticed it was missing 2 sides. I walked back in flagged someone down let them know they diligently worked on getting my sides to me handed them to me in a paper bag. I got home unbagged everything and instead of giving me my 2 sides they gave me a bunch of cornbread... decided not to go back as it was already too much trouble and I was already home. However I felt pretty ripped off as their prices re pretty high. They also uncharged us for beef ribs and after trying the beef ribs they were not very good. The Mac & Cheese didn't seem right had it that's before and was tastier this time it just didn't take like a premium side. I couldn't figure out what it was missing. Other than that everything else was ok. Upon picking up my food originally they asked me to repeat what I ordered and I told them and they had said it was all there when they handed it to me the first time so I don't know how they track orders or verify orders. The receipt I was given at the end only had the costs for the food and the rib surcharge. It didn't have any details really of what I ordered which could be why maybe it's confusing.  At any rate I'll give them a try again someday.   We ordered 2 , 3 meat plates with 2 sides each and an extra side. And the rest of the cost was tip."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! Finally amazing BBQ in Vegas! I got so Fed up with subpar barbecue in Vegas I bought a smoker and started cooking myself. Now I finally have a place to go to where the barbecue is far superior than anything that I could cook or is available in Vegas. You know they're serious about the barbecue when Big B drives to Texas just to get his wood! What more needs to be said! Large portions of perfectly smoked meats, amazing sides, and multiple types of sauce........ Pure BBQ Heaven!!! My two absolute favorites are the Beef Ribs and the BBQ Beans. I'm actually getting hungry while I write this review.... So I'm on my way over. Damn that's twice this week! Keep up the good work Big B!!"}
{"text":"Went to check out Big Bs Texas BBQ today and as soon as I walked in I could smell the aroma of delicious bbq smoking in the oven. They have a great selection of meats and proteins to choose from. I ordered the #7 which consist of 3 sliders and your choice of meat. I picked brisket, pulled pork and tri-tip. And you get 2 sides. I ordered the pasta salad and French fries. When you tip the employees they ring a cow bell and everyone in the kitchen yells and cheers and say thank you! the tables are picnic style and they can seat a large party comfortably with enough elbow room to dig into your food. They also included large TVs all around the resturant which are streaming ESPN and Sports Center and exactly what I would love to watch while I chow down on my BBQ! There are sauces on the table to add to your meal if need be. I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"My second time here. We live directly across the street. Staff is very friendly. Interior design is straight up rural Texas ranch. Food is delicoious. Tastes fresh and flavorful. They have several meats and sides to choose from. The owner (big huge buff dude) walks around and makes sure customers are doing ok.   I could sit here all day relaxing and just taking in the smell of the smoker. Definately recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the smoked Turkey breast. Every thing was good. Love the open atmosphere. Potato salad was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 meat plate with ribs and tri tip... both meats were soooooo good ! Corn was delicious as week. Will definitely be reordering  !!"}
{"text":"amazing bbq, amazing service, amazing people.. Very nice place after all intimidating vegas restaurants"}
{"text":"The dry rub baby back ribs are excellent. Good texture and great flavor. No need for BBQ sauce but if you do, it won't mess with the rib flavor but just give it another twist. As far as some of the other meats, they are all good my only complaint would be that the smoke over powers the meat to the point where it's hard to find the actual taste of the meat. I hope they succeed, because those ribs are now in my rotation."}
{"text":"Secret Menu Item!  LOADED BBQ SANDWICH  Customizable!!!  Great time with great people!  Come to MNF party every Monday night!  All you can eat BBQ and beer specials!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this new spot and its soooo good. There's not a lot of BBQ places in Vegas and this is def the best one. Try the turkey, it's the best smoked turkey I've had ever."}
{"text":"Let it be known that the 3 stars weighs in food and service combined. We came in on a slow weekday night and stepped into the line not knowing what to order. We were told to share a 3 meat plate that came with 2 sides (and an extra if you check in on yelp) and bread.  Ordered: Pulled Pork, Tri-tip brisket and baby back ribs ($5 extra due to half slab). On the side we chose Mac n cheese, beans and fries.   The sauce made the meal, and pretty much stole the show for me. The meat wasn't the tastiest as far as bbq joints went and I regret buying such large portions. I know they dry rub their meat, but it comes off too dry and I have to dump sauce to flavor it.   Tables are picnic tables and napkins are paper towels located at each table, along with their sauces. If you want some heat, you can ask for some of their hot sauce.   Service was the one great thing. Natalia knew her meats and was incredibly accommodating and patient while we chose what to order. Everyone else from the cashier to what I believe to be a manager, was kind and welcoming.   I'll try again next time and see if it changes any."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ in the state of Nevada very clean food tastes amazing staff was very friendly this is my new place to go on Sundays and eat and I'm pretty sure I think there a couple days a week also ;)"}
{"text":"Signed up to Yelp just to leave a review for this restaurant. Rarely have I had a meal that exceeded all my expectations but Big B's certainly did.   Ventured in on the recent holiday weekend with a group of 8 people, all hungry and all big BBQ fans. From the moment you walk in to Big B's, the smoke smell hits you straight away. Good luck trying to leave after the smell gets you, it's basically impossible ! We ordered a large variety of options, including the ribs, brisket Po'Boy, pulled pork etc together with at least 1 of every side. Everything was on our table within 5 minutes and before long the moans of delight could be heard through the restaurant. The food here is incredible !  I personally got the Po'Boy with brisket, and sides of creamed corn and Mac and cheese. The Po'Boy was ridiculously awesome. Meat that was smokey and tender, and just so much flavour. Salivating just thinking about it now. Sides were equally as good. I'd never had creamed corn before but it's definitely a new favourite. Mac and cheese was also ordered by a few others and we all agreed it was one of the best we've ever had (later found out it had 4 different cheeses in it)  Overall, the atmosphere together with the insanely good food makes Big B's an easy return location. I'll be sure to make a stop here on every Vegas trip without hesitation."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. The selection of meats is great, the cornbread is decadent, and do not get me started on the sides! Lol! The staff is friendly and beer is cold. The prices could be better, but the quality of the food really makes it worth it. Great place!"}
{"text":"UPDATED post from 4 months ago: First of All thank you Aimee!! See my picture the brisket is smoked KC style it's very tender and flavorful without sauce!  We also had the ribs which was call off the bone (litterly) with just the right amount of smoke.     Homemade fries just as good as \"Arthur Bryants\".  Every side baked beans, potatoe salad, cream corn, corn on the cob, cole slaw, pasta salad, fried okra was home made and fresh just like mama\"s. Also had smoked chicken which was delicious.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious bbq! Great portions great price! High key recommend the brisket. Tender juicy you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes! This is wonderful food. And amazing service. From the moment we walked in the door I felt like everyone wanted us to have the best experience. We will be back again and again. I couldn't even begin to tell you what is my favorite. All of it!"}
{"text":"Went on Yelp looking for a new bbq place and wouldn't you know found this place. Needless to say I'm in love. Bbq is out of this world and the sauce is amazing. For people who like their bbq smothered in sauce this is not the place but for people who appreciate great meat this is your place. For the price you get a lot of food and it's worth every penny. The bbq beans are the best I have ever had. Not only is the food great the service is even better everyone is  super friendly and makes sure you have what you need. Will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I am always keen for Big B's!   Not many great BBQ places in Henderson but this place hits every mark on my list. I'm a big fan of their pulled pork because it's so flavorful and not dried out at all. I usually go for the sliders and mac and cheese and spicy baked beans for my side. If you want a bigger meal, go for the plates. They also have desserts, never tried because I'm always stuffed after my meal here but they always look tasty. Another plus is that they have wine and beer, good selection too!   Inside is decorated well with lots of picnic tables and string lights. Definitely gives you that country BBQ feel. They have tvs and if I'm not mistaken, they regularly show the games. Great place for any size party. I will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ i've had in Vegas by far.  Their meats are perfectly smoked. Not too much that its overpowering, but enough to get a good mesquite flavor in the meat.  Tri Tip, beef ribs and their chicken are my favorites.   Sides are decent, really wish they had a mixed veggie just to have something at least close to healthy. Corn bread is extra too which is kind of a bummer.I'd settle for a smaller piece of corn bread if it was part of normal side selection.  Everyone is super nice and the atmosphere is great.  Hope they stick around foot a long time."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in a loong time since leaving Texas.  Friendly and attentive service.  They need to open one in California!!"}
{"text":"Pulled Pork & Brisket Amazing! Ribs 8 out of 10. When they first opened they used to smoke the mac and cheese and that was amazing but now they don't and it's alright.  Overall it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Thee BEST BBQ in all of Las Vegas - hands down! Definitely a must for locals, from the friendly and polite staff to the savory, tender ribs falling off the bone; you're certainly missing out if you have yet to come by!! Hope to see more locations soon!"}
{"text":"Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Delicious food, portion sizes were sufficient. Restaurant was clean and organized. Next time I'm in town I would come back here."}
{"text":"Decent food, but not great. Comparable to Lucille's as far as quality goes. Average. Brisket was super fatty...like, I didn't want huge loss in cooked weight (profit), so I barely smoked it, then finished it in the juices kind of fatty. The fat barely rendered into the meat, mushy texture with zero bark. Atmosphere is cool, staff was nice."}
{"text":"If you love Texas BBQ, this place comes pretty damn close.. From the atmosphere right when you walk in.. to the people working there.. The food is just awesome.. Not a really good idea to come here for lunch during work because you will be falling asleep all afternoon.. The brisket and the ribs is must !! side of mac n cheese and cream corn.. and you're golden.. Can't wait to come back and eat!!!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious. FINGER LICKIN GOOD! If you're deciding whether or not to try this place- GO! It's worth it :) so yummy."}
{"text":"I used Big B's Texas BBQ for a work function and everyone loved it.  They have good prices for groups.  The lean cut brisket was so tender and juicy.  I highly recommend stopping by here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Our family found this place by accident. Great atmosphere with picnic tables, great lighting, outdoorsy feel - like a barn. Country music playing and many different tvs to watch. The macaroni and cheese is a must. The hot links were awesome.  Bbq sauce was unique and really good. Fresh cut and made fries. Brisket was a little dry and they seemed like they were still looking for their rhythm. Staff seemed a little confused about how the orders were going to get completed, but in the end got it done, and served us quickly. The kids liked that all the staff were wearing flannel shirts.  All in all, we really liked it. It ended up about $16 a plate and we took home leftovers.  We will go back again!"}
{"text":"Real TX bbq y'all.  Meat is not drowned in sauce, simply smoked with a flavorful rub and the true nuance of the meat shows thru.   Food: 4  Ambiance: 4  Service: 4  Value: 3    We ordered: Brisket (wet) Tri-tip Ribs Mac n chz  Beans Potato salad  Brisket is the best I've had in in Vegas. Moist tender and seasoned perfectly - very light, allowing the brisket flavor to shine. No sauce needed.   Tri tip was good, a little more firm/dry in texture than the brisket but the flavor was spot on. Used a little of the sweet bbq sauce on this one.   Ribs. Omg the ribs. They totally brought me back to tx and my favorite little hole in the wall spot. Fall off the bone tender with just the right amount of crispy outside crust. Meat was juicy and the seasoning was on point. Absolutely no sauce needed.   Mac n chz was eh. Blah. For sure not a favorite and won't order again. It had a weird watery appearance (like it was being stretched with water or milk) and had no flavor. I didn't like the Mac but there are lots out there that do  Beans were great. It had a sweet and sour thing happening that I loved. They reminded me of charro beans. Down side is my bowl had nothing but beans in it, no bark no meat no peppers and I see some pics here that do. Oh well. It was still yum.   Potato salad was good. Better than others out there. Not too mustardy or too salty.   Lunch for me and hubs (no sodas just water) came to $38 - a little high but we did have some leftovers to take home. Take note - there are plenty of upcharges here, be aware when placing your order.   The only down side is they don't serve real TX sweet tea. Tx BBQ and sweet tea go hand in hand.   Will definitely return when the craving for ribs and brisket comes up"}
{"text":"I wish I could say that I loved this place, but I think 3 stars is a good representation. It's definitely not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it most certainly is not the worst.   We stopped in one afternoon for a quick bite. The first thing you notice is the smell of smoke, large picnic-style tables everywhere, and the loud TV's broadcasting sports (in this case, football). The area was clean and well kept, and the staff were pleasant and very helpful. When asking questions, they were quite knowledgeable about their respective BBQ.  We ordered a #3, which is a 3 meat plate. We requested chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. The chicken was quite good. Tender and smoky, but not too dry (especially because most of the meat was breast meat) which can be difficult to accomplish. The pork I did not really appreciate, as it was drowned in sauce and I could not appreciate the taste of the meat. The brisket was tender and had a nice bark which my husband liked.  All in all I would say that this place is a solid. It really isn't anything out of this world, but it is definitely good for some comfort-style food in Henderson, which can be hard to find!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Tri tip, pulled pork, fries, fried okra, baked beans....best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Customer service at this place is amazing, they constantly check up on you and make sure everything is ok. We ordered the family package good for 4-5pp which was a lot of food for even 7pp. When they delivered the food my husband saw the chicken that was a bit pinkies still and made a comment to the person, we were told that because it is smoked that it's pink. The owner or manager came over to see if we want to change the chicken to another type of meat if we were not comfortable if it being a little pink, but we said we were ok with it. That was very nice of him to offer. The meat was really tender, potato salad was out of these world, creamed corn was so good as well as the corn bread."}
{"text":"We parked near Raising Canes, intending to get chicken fingers tonight and decided to try the new barbecue place that shares a parking lot. Now I am pretty sure we will never make the mistake of going to get chicken again.   Everything was fantastic. We got Tri-tip, pulled pork, and the jalape√±o cheddar hot link as entrees. All were outstanding but the pork and Tri-tip were some of the best I've ever had. For our sides, we got the Mac n cheese, corn on the cob, BBQ baked beans and creamed corn. I kid you not, the creamed corn was the best side of the lot. Don't miss out; be sure to get it. The beans were a tad spicy but amazing and the mac n cheese was stellar. We also tried the cornbread muffins which were delightful. They have bit of cinnamon in them, which was a nice touch.   The ambience was fantastic. Very cute place with picnic tables/benches, barbecue sauces at the table and rolls of paper towels. The staff was super helpful and friendly and the owner was on site to receive our compliments for the amazing food.   Much of my family is from Texas and this place lives up to its name. We will definitely be back with our appetites and friends!"}
{"text":"Craving BBQ and found this little Gem. I got the BBQ Chicken Po' Boy and it was the juiciest chicken I've ever had. He got 2 meats and sides and loved the tri-Tip. All together our meal was less than $30. We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Went back for a second attempt yesterday and Thank you Aimee!!!! The Food was excellent, the ribs, brisket,chicken, pulled pork And Turkey!! Sides were amazing!!! People try this place out!"}
{"text":"Finally a good BBQ place in Vegas!  The tri tip was smoky and the brisket was most. However, the beef ribs did not have very much meat and was not worth the $5 upcharge."}
{"text":"We had a Memorial Day party catered by Big B's Texas BBQ. Twenty four guests attended and to the person the feedback was excellent. Brian, the owner, gives wonderful customer service and is easy to deal with. I do recommend Big B's to anyone that appreciates real BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Been here 3 times and never disappointed..very friendly and country vibe. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Overall: I won't claim to be a BBQ aficionado but this is hands down the best BBQ that I've had. Plus, the service is awesome!  Food: 4.5  2 Meat Plate ($15): This is definitely enough for two people as long as you aren't strong eaters. We got the trip tip and ribs (extra $5) with coleslaw, french fries, and mac & cheese.  Tri Tip: I'm amazed by how lean yet tender this was. It is on the drier side because it's a lean piece of meat, but this a good choice if you want to avoid super fatty meats. If you want something juicier, I'd definitely get the brisket!  Baby Back Ribs: Don't expect thick globs of sauce slathered on. These were dry but well seasoned. The ribs had nice crisp outer pieces with meat tender enough to pull with a fork.  Coleslaw: Balance was perfect. I appreciate that this wasn't too heavy because there was a touch of acidity in the dressing.  French Fries: They use fresh cut potatoes, so they don't get extra crispy. But they have great seasoning, and you'll like them if you don't mind a fry with a soft crispy outside and fluffy inside.  Mac & Cheese: Unfortunately, this was just slightly better than KFC. It was a tad too dry, and it lacked the cheesy, flavorful punch of really good mac & cheese.  Service: 5  This is kind of like a quick service restaurant where you order and pay at the counter and then someone brings out your food to your table.  The entire staff was pretty nice. When they found out that it was our first time, they explained the entire menu, and they even offered samples for us! They were super generous with their samples, and they gave thick slices of brisket to each person in our party when asked.  Ambiance: 5  The moment you walk in you smell the BBQ. It's a super cute restaurant that totally embraces its Texas BBQ theme. The dining area is designed like an outdoor picnic area with long wooden benches and tables with umbrellas. I also love that you have a view of the kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! It has a great atmosphere and all of the food looked great. I tried the chicken and it was pretty good. Very juicy and the bbq sauce was yum!! The french fries were also fresh and very good. The staff was polite and the service was fast. My only complaint was that I thought it was was a little pricey for what you got. Maybe if the plate meals included a drink and corn bread (you only get regular sliced bread), I'd be happier. Overall though, I'd recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place. They have only been open about a week, so still working out the kinks but my visit today around 11:30am on a Tuesday was a very pleasant dining experience. Their hours are 11am to 10pm.  Its located just west of the Hospital, very close to Raising Canes, on the south side of St. Rose Pkwy. Parking lot is big, plenty of available parking.   When you walk in you see a lot of wooden picnic tables (12) and a few tables made from wooden spools in a very large space. Plenty of room for everyone! They have several large screen tv's around so you can watch sports on them. They do serve beer, as well as the 100 flavor soda machine, sweet and regular ice teas.   Their menu is pretty extensive, brisket, tri tip, baby back ribs, pork loin, pulled pork, chicken, turkey, links and more. They do meat plates (1,2 or 3 choices), sandwiches, etc. Lots of sides to choose from.   I went with the two meat plate ($13.99) with brisket and tri tip (where's the beef? on my plate!)  with a side of corn on the cob and BBQ beans. You get a couple slices of bread with that as well. Good old family style BBQ plate with plenty of food. I liked the fact that when you ordered the meat they pulled a section out of a warmer oven, and sliced it for you. For me the tri tip was delicious, moist and a good smoky flavor, although a bit on the cool side temperature wise. The brisket was chopped, and my serving was a bit dry and not as good smoky flavor. Reading other reviews I think its worth another try. The BBQ beans have two different style beans in a sweet sauce with jalapeno (?) and big chunks of brisket. The corn on the cob was not burnt like in other photos here, had a touch of smoky flavor, just needed butter. Two sauces, one a vinegar/ketchup base and the other a mustard base were on the tables. Neither sauce wow'd my personal taste buds, but worked nicely with the meats.  I had a nice interaction with the serving staff, they were all friendly and helpful. The owner Brian had just left but his kind wife was there to answer a lot of my questions and even took me back to show me the smoker unit. They have a multi-layer smoker, use mostly mesquite and oak woods, and maintain temperatures from 225 to 250. She said it takes a bit getting used to this smoker and cooking times, so I expect as they continue to cook it will get really good. She also told me they started off with one rotation of meats and found out they were running out around 6pm so now they do 2 rotations. Pretty much someone is there 24 hours a day. The entire back area was clean and well organized. They actually drive to Texas 2 times a year to load up on wood as its hard to find here or really expensive.   I'll be back for sure. I look forward to a great sample of the brisket, as well as trying the porks, ribs, and chicken. Prices are fair for Vegas. When you tip, the entire staff yells out \"Beer Money\" so tip well."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! The portions were great. The owners were super nice! We were a group of 6 we had all different meats and sides. All were delicious."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and over priced. There was nothing wrong with the food but for 21.89 for a three meat plate with a soft drink is over priced when it's served on a red plastic tray with a piece of paper that the order was written on in between it and the food and the cutlery is flimsy plastic. Dickies BBQ is better value any day of the week. Though these guys' brisket was better than dickies but not 5$ better. 5$ extra for ribs = another ri(b) off (get it ;-) ). Cheap decor. One kind of rather boring BBQ sauce. I think this was set up to be a money making machine and I bet it is but I don't think it will be for long."}
{"text":"Okay, here we go.... I have passed by this place several times and kept telling myself, I am going drop in and check out the menu. I have been saying this for the last 6 months.   Earlier today,  I  picked up my 1st cousin and her son who arrived from New York City. I  told her that we were going straight to this place to eat ... \"Texas BBQ IN Henderson, NV.   The three of us ordered three different types of meats with sides from the menu. Let me tell you.... You need to Stop in and taste the food for yourselves,  You will NOT be disappointed... in fact , I'm asking myself \" Why did I wait so long \" .  Any & everyone that come visit me here in Henderson will be stopping by Texas BBQ for a meal.  Mr. JP"}
{"text":"This is the kind of barbecue place that locals deserve. I have tried places across Las Vegas and Henderson and this is one of only two that I return to regularly. You can't go wrong with a two or three meat plate. The brisket and pulled pork are staples of my meals. The fried okra is second-best only to my mother's. We bought our Thanksgiving dinner here and it was a hit with everybody. The owners and staff are great and we try to come at least weekly."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just finished eating here and we have to say the ribs are the best we've ever had!!! We were opting between Raising Canes, and my girlfriend picked the barbecue place!! It was the best decision on food ever!! Everything was on point and the staff was friendly and helpful for us being our first time. The manager also checked on everyone to ensure a good meal!!! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"First time here and we missed the line! Went in the wrong way....was it that obvious we were first timers? We got the meat platter with beef ribs. It was amazing! Will definitely be back. Go here. Go here. Go here!"}
{"text":"My brother wanted to try out this place and so we, as a family were in on it. The place is awesome and so is their customer service. The food looked and smelled delicious but it was the taste that was lacking. The meats were dry...the corn bread, well personally I prefer a freshly baked cornbread. Their sides were better in my personal opinion. Again great place/atmosphere but the food wasn't much to brag about amongst friends/family."}
{"text":"Went here as a fluke and was greatly impressed!! Not only did they get the door for us but even gave us some great money saving advice! Food was fast, hot and huge portions and was delicious!! Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some authentic southern hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the vegas area. Had lunch and the brisket melted in my  mouth and the hot links were excellent as well. I have  been to every  BBQ place in  the area. I have to say  this  place  is the best."}
{"text":"Today9/8/17 wanted some BBQ so went back to Big B's Texas BBQ.   Seeing that you can now order I used Yelp eat 24!  So glad we did cause as soon as we got there, our food was plated and packed and we were out the door.  No waiting!! I will definitely use Yelp eat 24 again!   Thanks for the yummy food!  The brisket was SOOO Moist! I loved it!!"}
{"text":"I tried the ribs, tri-tip, fries, potatoes salad, and the ghost pepper hot sauce topped it off!!!"}
{"text":"I am actually from Texas, so I mean it when I say this BBQ is something special!! (See my Pot Liquor review). Every time I come here I am more impresssed than the last. This is really great food, generous portions and good prices. I can't say enough good things. I always get the brisket po-boy with mac and cheese and corn on the cob. The brisket is full of flavor without any sauce and melts in your mouth...the true sign of good BBQ, even the bread is fresh. The mac and cheese is amazing even when reheating and the corn is a full cob. Only thing that could make me love this place more? Banana pudding, blue bell ice cream and bbq baked potatoes. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Were to begin? You have to love a place that assaults your senses as soon as you walk in the door. Knowing KC bbq I told the young lady that took our order I have high standards for bbq. Let me say I was not disappointed at all. Large portions and the pulled pork was AMAZING. So moist just melt in your mouth. Fried okra was on point. Will definitely be back here. If you love good food friendly staff, Run don't walk to Big B's Texas BBQ you will not be disappointed and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat here today.  The good is the decor is awesome. Very homey, clean and comfortable. Whoever, did this gets 10 stars! Next, the employees were fabulous. Very nice and prompt with service.   Now, on to the main menu. They have a nice selection and reasonable prices. Their sides are amazing. We had cream corn and I watched others get their sides and they all looked good. I didn't care for the baked beans but they weren't bad. Just not my cup of Tea.   Now, onto the meats. We had the chicken, ribs and pork. They all were fall off the bone tender and a great smokey flavor. However, they are just smoked. NO seasoning or sauce at all. I prefer a dry rub seasoning. I tried their sauces they were a little to bland for me. I prefer a rich sweet BBQ sauce. Their sauces are runny and lacked in flavor. The Mustard sauce tasted like vinegar, a little Mustard and a gallon of Black Pepper. Also, the cornbread was soooo dry! I did really enjoy the Peach Cobbler and it was a great price at 2.99.   All in all I will come back for the cobbler and sides. I might try the meats again but just to go. So, I can use my own sauce. I hope they make the small changes and this place could be phenomenal."}
{"text":"I love the pulled pork.   Big B's is a huge space with lots of parking. You could have a party where everyone drives separately and there would still be room to park and eat. Picnic tables aplenty, you can bring the whole family and then some. Like I said, huge!!!  I ordered the single meat plate. Pulled pork is life and that's all I needed. Plus, it comes with two sides!!! Like Thanksgiving, to me, BBQ is all about the sides. I opted for the coleslaw this time and the beans. You guys, their beans are the magical fruit! So much flavor.   My friend got the two meat plate with chicken and brisket. He elected Mac and cheese and fried okra for sides. I totally stole massive amounts of the Mac and cheese to mix with my beans and was surprised by the fried okra. Didn't think that it was my jam from pervious experiences at other joints, but these were crispy little nuggets of flavor! The crunch was perfect.   The portions here are generous, staff is super passionate, and there is plenty of room for all of Vegas to grab a seat and eat.   Ask for a side of Yelp Sauce. It's spicy AF and a great addition to their BBQ sauce served on the tables. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"This place is great! Big portions and good flavor! Staff are very friendly. Dining area is awesome!!! Picnic tables makes it feel like you're having a meal with family in your own backyard. Pecan pie is very good!!!"}
{"text":"This place is worthy of 5 stars.   We walked in and realized it's cafeteria-like ordering style.  We were promptly greeted and was told, all the ribs just sold out and they won't have it again until tonight.  Immediately turned me off, because that's my go-to choice of meat.    Contemplating whether to go with 1 or 2 meats, the lady told us it would about 4 ounce portions per meat.  I went with the brisket, tri-tip, corn on the cob and coleslaw for my two sides.  My husband got the tri-tip and the turkey breast.  The turkey is actually slow cooked for 7 hours and who knows what process the rib and meats go through, since they ran out based on popularity.    All the meats were neatly sliced, no fats trimmed, just in case you're into that sort of thing.  The meats were lightly seasoned, and perfect if you want to add your own sauce.  Amazingly, the meats were so tender, you can just use your fork.  We tried the two type of sauces, for the sake of trying it.  The verdict, the meat alone is the star without any other sauce.  Great tri-tip, awesome briskets, most surprisingly, is the tender turkey (cashier said it was her favorite).  Corn on the cob was wrapped up in foil and there's nothing cool about mushy kernels.  I unwrapped it, well seasoned and I cut away with my plastic knife.  Mmm, yummy was my reaction and it wasn't even mushy or soggy at all.  Thank goodness.  The slaw was again lightly seasoned, not too much of anything.  The plated meals also comes with wheat, white and I think rye bread.  Nothing special, just sliced bread that appear to be Orowheat of some brand.  The decor is your typical Texas BBQ joint.  Nicely done with wooden benches, round tables for big and small parties.    Finally, a BBQ joint that is good, not smothered in sauce, so you can taste the meat.  The cuts of meats were good and hardly any fat on them.  I'm no connoisseur on grading meat, but this was delicious BBQ.  This is a real gem in Henderson.    The icing on the cake was when a manager/owner asked us about our meal.  When you care that much to simply ask, you get honest feedback.  If there is happy hour prices, we might consider gathering co-workers after work."}
{"text":"This review is based off of 2 visits, both around lunch time.   On our first visit, I ordered the lunch special written on the board. It says \" BBQ Chicken wings with fries and drink\", we also wanted to order sliders but the woman who was taking our order stated that there aren't a lot of meat on the sliders and it basically gave us the vibe that it was not a good choice. We changed our order to a brisket po boy instead. However, I feel that if the employees are pushing you away from a certain order, that item has to change.  The wings came out 15 minutes later, my girlfriend was done eating her po boy. I basically watched her eat and she watched me eat afterwards. It would have been better if they brought out both entrees at the same time. Also, the wings were not BBQ, they were just plain fried chicken wings. Although, there was a BBQ sauce on the table, so I drenched it in that. The fries came out fresh and crispy which was delicious.  I would also add that the menu is not easy to understand for people who do not eat bbq at a regular basis. I was not aware of the up charges on different meats that was not stated in their combo meals, I would of thought the meat quantity would have been adjusted to accommodate the combo price.  Anyways, the food is still good.. Could use some work here and there especially in the menu area."}
{"text":"This place was ok, I wouldnt say the best. I tried the sliders and it was just eh, Ok. Nothing special, the fries ade like five guys fries, the corn bread was ok, the corn on the cob was ok. I wish they had more sides to choose from. The Mac and Cheese was horrible, it had no flavor. My son disnt want to eat it, and I dont blame him. The only thing that was good was the smoked chicken. Overall I wasnt impressed, and I still prefer Bells BBQ. The service was great, and they were nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Since I am the current duke here, I think Im overdue for an update. Big B's definitely deserves an upgrade to 4 stars. My favorite sides are the bbq beans, mac n cheese and creamed corn. They are consistently very good with the bbq beans being some of the best I have had.   The meats have a wonderful smoke flavor and you can taste the love. I usually get either brisket or tri tip but last night I tried the ribs for the first time and they were outstanding. Prepared exactly how I like ribs, no sauce but tender, moist and fall of the bone. Like the other meats they had a great smoky flavor. A little pricey at $15 for a half rack but well worth it.   Big B's is a great choice for BBQ when in the area. They have a large beer and wine selection and plenty of picnic bench seating. They will continue to be my go-to for BBQ!"}
{"text":"Brisket was good, chicken was flavorful but on the dry side. Excellent service. Great corn bread. Didn't have to wait in line. Price was good for meal we received."}
{"text":"We had this delivered thru Post Mates, who is not to blame at all for this review. To begin with, I've never seen BBQ that looked like it was being served at McDonalds...as in all perfectly proportioned and processed. The tri-tip and brisket looked exactly the same, except for the size of the slices...and tasted exactly the same too. If you like to pick pieces of cushion from the slice in the couch and eat them, I highly recommend this place.   The chicken wasn't much better..but edible. I'm not sure how they made corn bread taste so bland, but I'm curious, because I didn't think it was possible. However, the coleslaw was amazing...not because it was really good, but because it actually had a flavor, and that made us very happy."}
{"text":"Walking in the place smells amazing and you become instantly intoxicated by the fumes of grill. I'm Vegan so I didn't have the meat but it definitely looked juicy for all you meat eaters lol. The manager Natalia was very friendly and helpful with suggesting their more vegan choices! I definitely recommend dining here :)"}
{"text":"By far best BBQ in Vegas. Had the two meat plate with chicken and tri tip and it was amazing. Good portions. I had the beans and corn on the cob as my sides. Both were excellent. Beans were easily by far the best I have ever had. I like how they provide BBQ sauce and a peppered mustard on the table. BBQ sauce is phenomenal. Perfect blend of sweet and smoky.  Will definitely be back soon"}
