{"text":"This place is horrible, I heard lot of people say \"pho Hung \" is bad. But I saw they put under new management, so I want to try see how is it new.. OMG...it is super disappointed, they are a copy cat, they copy the menu from one of the restaurant on LA,menu exactly the same of them but the food is super horrible. Service is bad. I ordered the Vietnamese dry noodles(mi kho ),usually it had oyster sauce on it,guest what,this dry noodles had nothing on it.I asked my server why it doesn't have sauce,he give me a funny answer \"it had sauce on it,but is white sauce \". Wth is \"white sauce\" I never heard that,I try one bite, it is salt & water mix = white sauce.  I highly recommend people do not go to this place, you'll waste your money on to this restaurant with a horrible food & service. I don't want to give even one star."}
{"text":"I don't know how I passed off as an Asian without trying pho 'til my 3rd year in university.  (Fail, I know.) And of course, Pho Hung was my first. It was love a first slurp and I quickly became a regular. Every other day my roommate and I would walk over here to be fed by the sweetest owner ever. She and the wait staff would start expecting us and make jokes about keeping a tab instead. We got to know about her daughter and son and she asked us about our upcoming exams. The waiters and waitresses always remembered the extra limes I needed and even stopped me on the street to say hi. (Embarrassing I know.) I was a pho-addict and they were my dealer.  I happened to be in the area today and figured I should have some pho (as I haven't been in Toronto for a year.) Just before I walked in, I read the sign saying that today was their last day of business. It was like fate.   When I was sat down today, the wait staff remembered me and realized how long it's been. Some even specifically came over just to say hi. So sweet.   Pho hung has the best pho I've tried in Toronto. Makes sense as they've been open for 21 years. It's really a shame that the savory soup and delicious noodles will only be just a memory as the condo goes up in its place. The future U of T students will really be losing part of \"the experience\".   Thank you Pho Hung for the amazing memories I've had with friends and all the times you fed me when I was stressed. I will truly miss my #08 small well done.   Best wishes and love, the girl with the extra limes"}
{"text":"This is my current favorite pho place in Las Vegas.  I go once every week to 10 days, or so.  Pho hung never fails to satisfy my cravings for noodle soup.  I always order the same thing:  pho tai, with the beef on the side (so I can drop it in to the broth at my leisure, and keep it rare), and an order of spring rolls - shrimp only, hold the pork.   The broth is always perfectly seasoned, with a rich beef flavor - never greasy or watery.  Each bowl is generous on the noodles, and comes with the customary plate of bean sprouts, limes, herbs, and chili peppers.  Sometimes, when I've got a big appetite, I order an extra plate of beef slices for $3.  Even with this addition, my meal never costs more than $15 total.  I always have left overs.  Pho makes a wonderful meal on the cheap.  Pho Hung is also good for late night dining.  They're open every night until 2am.  Like many eateries of its particular genre, the service can be quite lackadaisical.  I'm personally willing to overlook that for the quality of the food and the low price.    The dining room itself isn't what I'd call attractive.  it's harshly lit, and a little gaudy - though always very clean.  If you love pho, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great Pho. I'm little Saigon area in so cal so I know good pho. This place is good. I have never tried this place due to the bad reviews on yelp. But tried it today and was pleasantly surprised. They have a very big menu. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"this place sucks. period. not sure how it is still opened.  the decor looked really nice so i was expecting some bomb pho. pretty much all pho tastes the same to me except for maybe the slight differences in the meat balls they serve but regardless im not one to complain about my pho but omg...this place sucks. i was seriously craving something warm and soupy and pho 99.99% hits the spot. the pho here was not hot at all maybe warm to give it some credit. normally when i eat pho i have to blow and blow to cool it enough to eat. over here it would be a joke for me to blow on it.  the broth is also way too sweet. my dad is a pho junkie and in all the years hes dragged me from pho shop to pho shop, i never had pho that tasted so crappy.....serious....how is this place still open?!? haha it must be a cover shop for some underground gambling ring in the basement because no way would a person in their right mind come back here again.  also our server messed up on our order and then the cashier messed up on our bill. GG pho hung"}
{"text":"Grabbed quick takeout on a Friday night with very little wait.  Veggie Pho - fresh and delicious, packed with lots of mung sprouts and thai basil with some sweet/hot sauce and soy, a side of rice noodles to add.  Pad Thai - (I know) decent representation of its kind for a Vietnamese place.  Steamed rice - exactly as ordered.  I would love to go back and would eat here at least weekly if I lived close enough."}
{"text":"The bo tai slices are a little weird here. Not quite what I'm used to. Maybe it's from a different cut of beef? It wasn't solid, and more...stringy. Of course it was served rare, which is normal, but I think the clumps of beef I got made it hard for the soup to cook through to the centre of the chunks.  My main complaint was the bug-eaten basil leaves I got. I know that not everyone eats the basil, but as the proprietor, I don't think the risk in customer dissatisfaction is worth the 2 cents you'll save on the basil leaves. I asked for a fresh stem, and I got one, but by then, I was hesitant about the quality of everything else they were serving. How about the bean sprouts? Did they even wash them?  I don't really judge the service in places like this. As long as I get the food, I'm satisfied.  Go up to the register to pay your bill. I wish they'd tell me these things before having to wait too long at my table."}
{"text":"Went in with a black friend of mine around 10 PM or so.  The chubby dude kept eying us the whole time like we were going to rob the place or something. I've been there before and this didn't happen, so it must have been because of my black friend. LoL. Anyways, the pho portion was on the small side. The broth tasted like water and salt and msg.  The vegetable for the pho looked old, some of the bean sprout was soggy, not crispy and white like they should be."}
{"text":"I love Pho Hung. I live in Victoria college residence just 10 minutes away so before they closed, I always ate there. The food is incredible and the quantities are amazing for only 6 to 8 bucks.  My only complaint would be the customer service. Waiters barely smile or talk to you, or even maintain eye contact. The only friendly contact I ever have is with the cute little old lady working the cash. Everyone else just looks irritated to be working. The carpet is also super grungy and has not been cleaned in years. I don't reccomend sitting in a corner.  Overall though as long as you don't mind minimal contact, AWESOME food and AWESOME prices and otherwise PERFECT! As a college student with minimal funds, it was great to have such a cheap place around that had such INCREDIBLE FOOD! I'LL MISS YOU!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Not only did the food take 40 minutes to arrive, it tasted dry and bland. They put a lot of vegetables to make up for the lack of meat. They got the order wrong and charged us for an extra egg that we never ordered! We were even missing two drinks! Never coming back ever again."}
{"text":"I haven't tried too many other dishes from this place so I can't really rate them. The only reason I go to eat Vietnamese food is for the rice noodle vermicelli, either with the beef broth soup or the dry noodles on a bed of vegetables with charbroiled pork.   I have tried those two same dishes at three other locations in Las Vegas and in Reno trying to find THE ONE, and this is by far the one with the best service, taste, and freshness.   I have no idea why its never more crowded. Business seems modest at best so there is always someone available to render quick and prompt service. The pork on the dry noodles is juicy and flavorful, and the meats in the soup are all just the right texture and taste.   Unlike some other pho places, the soup and pork doesn't leave me with dry mouth afterwards so thankfully they don't dump MSG or salt into their dishes to compensate for their taste.    The restaurant is spacious, clean, and comfortable. Prices are very fair and portions are big. My search for a pho HQ is over and I can't seem to go back enough."}
{"text":"I had the regular pho with beef and it was good. The meat and noodles were what you'd expect but the broth put it over the top...and really it's the broth that makes a good pho  The service was on both sides of the fence as the main guy who served us looked like he had murderous / suicidal tendencies while the girl who brought our food was really nice and cracking jokes.  At the end of the day if you want good Pho and you're in the area of blood and avenue you can't beat it  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Finding this place was an accident which I'm glad we did. Me and a couple of friends were just really hungry at the time and had no idea where to go. Luckily, we were around the area and our navigation led us to this awesome restaurant. I personally love the food specially the fried tofu and egg roll. They have a big serving so the price is just right for the amount that they give you. The plates that they use per person could be a serving plate at home ;-) I love going there and for the most part there isn't a lot of people when I go. They serve fast too which is a plus if your hungry.."}
{"text":"I'm from san jose, I go to las vegas twice a year sometime more. I been to many pho places, but pho hung was probably the best!!      I was there around midnight. I was relieved that they were open til two. I went in for pho.      The host was very down to earth, very polite. pho was excellent. I really enjoyed my late dinner. I definitely recommend everyone I know to eat at this place. Keep doing what you guys are doing! You have my support."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese in the city.  Consistently great food; great value for the money.  Excellent pho and bun entries."}
{"text":"I've seen some reviews here accusing pho hung of not being authentic, which is totally bogus. The food here is delicious, affordable and completely authentic. In the 50 or so times I've been here I have never left hungry or unhappy.   A couple notes, take out is super quick, but always smaller portions than eat in. This is the original location, where the founders son still works, the location in china town is the second location. And finally, it's pronounced FA, not FO, try ordering it correctly and you'll be surprised how friendly the staff can be.   Try #22! My all time favorite."}
{"text":"It's going to be a bit hard for me to review this place because I have different opinions on 2 of the things we ordered. So, I figure going w/ 3-stars (A-OK) would suffice.   Pho ga (chicken pho) - All the chicken pieces had the skin still on them. I'm not much of a fan w/ chicken skin in soup. The soup had A LOT of oil floating on the top which I didn't like either. It wasn't good, but it was better than bad. (Does that make sense?)   Cha gio (fried egg rolls) - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! They're huge! The biggest we've ever seen. And they give you plenty of pieces. This may be the only reason I'd go back here. But I do have to commend them on their great customer service."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. It was not fresh at all. The meat was old as earth and the veggies were dry... honestly the best thing I had was the tea. The tea was delicious ... I ordered beef briscut pho. it was rancid.  Waste of money...  if you like to go to pho restaurants for tea then you will love it ."}
{"text":"N'ayant pas fait de nombreux restaurants vietnamien à Toronto du à un manque de temps,  Je peux néanmoins vous dire que celui ci est nettement au dessus de la moyenne(comprenez par un très bon restaurant pour manger le pho, n'ayant malheureusement pas l'espace nécessaire pour goûter le reste).  Ce plat à base de boeuf est typiquement Vietnamien que vous retrouverez du Sud, au Nord et en passant par le Centre, au SOLEILou sous la pluie (surtout en temps de mousson) En somme si vous voulez goûter LE plat traditionnel Vietnamien, vous ne pouvez pas passer à côté du PHO qui est très bien servi dans ce restaurant"}
{"text":"I was in the area yesterday with two friends and we were all craving for pho. Since this was around the corner, we stopped by. Worse service ever! The tables didn't even have utensils or sauce....until our meals came they noticed we were missing chopsticks. We had to ask for the two sauces; sadly they just took it from another table without asking the people who sat there. The pho soup base was watered-down with no flavour. My friend ordered a Vietnamese drink (the one where they put salt/sugar at the bottom with ice with ginger ale poured over). She was very disappointed in the drink - they put way too much sugar in her cup. The waiters/waitress were extremely rude and ignored us several times when they clearly saw that we were calling them over. One waitress had extreme attitude towards the customers.  Very disappointed. I changed my mind and will never return, even if i was in the area. Take the subway instead to Spadina and experience much better Pho there!"}
{"text":"Great place for Pho! But the beef is too rare, asking them for extra hot soup will help!  Service is poor though, especially when it gets busy. They could use some more waiters or waitresses."}
{"text":"If not for the location, I would never come here. Unfortunately because of the location I've come here 3 times, each time hoping that maybe they got better, only to leave sorely disappointed (again). Their pho is not horrendous, but really not worth me coming back again and again unless I am in the area and I am EXTREMELY desperate for pho. I've tried their bun too and it was also meh but still better than their pho. The service is one of the crappiest I've ever come across. No server there bothers to be nice. Even King's noodles service can be better at times."}
{"text":"Parking is in a strip mall, and it has been here for a few years. Only reason my family and I went here was because we wanted to try a different pho place. All I can say is every thing that we ate had no salt and probably very little MSG because everything that we ate was so bland.  I am of Vietnamese descent so I know a good pho place when I taste it. Overall the place is big and spacious, very clean.  BTW, we were the only people in the restaurant and you would figure that the wait staff would be more than fumbling over each other to help us with anything that we would ask for but the service was worse than so-so."}
{"text":"This place always has yummy food at a very reasonable price. I often get their lunch special, which is usually $7. At most I usually pay $10. And the spring rolls are amazing!  I eat here far too often!"}
{"text":"Will miss this spot. looks a little grungy and carpet has seen better days. I happened to dine on its last day open. Not memorable but food was delicious"}
{"text":"This is a lovely vietnamese restaurant which sells Pho (rice noodle) as the name sugests. They also have another store in Spadina avenue in China town, which I think tastes a bit better.    The pho there is delicious, though not the best in Toronto. I usually order the house special as they have a mixture of beef (raw or less raw on request), beef tripe, beef ball, beef tendon and sprout bean in the soup. They also sell fried rice and other types of noodles. I don't think that vietnamese coffee there is the best, but it is something you should try if you've never had vietnamese before.    They are affordable, and quite busy so service may not be the best. However, I can't complain as the food is quite filling!"}
{"text":"Friday night and unlike the majority of Chinatown /Koreatown this place wasn't over crowded amd had great customer service! Fresh ingredients and wonderful staff! Our new favorite phó spot over phó kim long! Only gripe: sprouts had been sitting in water a tad too long. We will be back next time we want phó!"}
{"text":"The place is definitely nice and clean. The seating arrangements and the decor were very comfortable. I just wish that the pho had flavor. to my disappointment, it did not, it was very bland. I had to keep adding fish sauce, siracha and pepper for my soup to get some flavor. I love Vietnamese food and i hate giving out two stars to this establishment but it failed to make the passing grade. I hope their food gets better because I do not want any one to fail in this economy."}
{"text":"My Favorite Vietnamese Restaurant!! The Food is always great! Customer Service is pretty good. First time we came to this spot a guy names peter was the one that helped us with what to order. And ever since then, we've always been going to this restaurant. We've brought friends/family in this place and they love the food and service too. Don't forget the environment. I love the setting of this place, Very comfortable, laid back and It doesn't feel that the servers are gawking at you while you eat.  The price is VERY Affordable as well. You will love it. They give you time to order and they always make sure your attended with all your needs!!  LOVE THIS PLACE!! TRY THIS RESTO!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT. =)"}
{"text":"Had the rolls and noodle and steak bowl with fish sauce everything was really good. If you are interested in trying Vietnamese food you will like it. Service was friendly and I tried the 33 beer for the first time-tasted very good. I gave it 4 stars because this is a place I would go to again when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"We came back to this restaurant, since it's under new management.  To our surprise, the food was great authentic Vietnamese food!  I had the pho, which was excellent!  And my husband had the lemongrass chicken with egg rolls in a vermicelli noodle bowl, and that was excellent also!  It's hard to find Vietnamese egg rolls with the rice paper, and this place has it!  Will definitely frequent this place!"}
{"text":"Best broth in town! I'm a pho-natic and have tried a lot of different places around Chinatown and the southeast side. This place is #1 in terms of flavor and broth.  Very accommodating owners. We come in with a large group on Sunday nights with a lot of very specific demands and they always take care of us.   But it all comes back to the broth... Rich, complex flavor, perfectly balanced herbs. And they aren't stingy with the meat and other fixings either.   Come for the pho, stick to something traditional, leave very very happy."}
{"text":"6 star for their Spring Roll if possible, it's still the best in Las Vegas as I think & 3 star for the slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww soup. Also, just found there is a minimum charge for credit card: $15!"}
{"text":"Live music on certain days. They have a cheesy 70s style stage and glitter.  By the way I am reviewing a pho shop.   I ordered the steak pho,  good amount of meat,  good broth flavor.  Also had the crispy egg rolls.  It's three enrolls cut in half and served with lots of lettuce and pickled veggies. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place in Vegas!  1st introduced to me by a colleague who hails from Vietnam.  It's a step up from the little noodle shops all over Chinatown.  Great menu, and the staff is always very nice.    Fresh ingredients and one of the most flavorful broths of any pho place I've visited."}
{"text":"I normally don't give 1-star reviews, but I can't not do this. For a girl who grew up on pho and spring rolls, I am so disappointed that a restaurant touting itself as \"authentic Vietnamese\" is still in business. *sigh* here goes.  I am at the ROM. I am hungry. It is super cold outside - so cold that walking gloveless for even a few short steps really hurts my hands. So I step out of the ROM intent on finding sustenance before returning to the museum. I spot Pho Hung right across the street! (Note: even when mental alarm bells were ding-ding-dinging -- Pho Hung is in the same building as McDonalds and a random tacqueria -- my hunger plus it's-so-cold-i-need-pho urge is forcing my legs to walk in its direction).  Firstly, the service is very lacking. It is cold. I know my party is \"just one\", but come on. Do not put me at the table closest to the freezing stairs (which leads down to the front door).  Secondly, the tea was bitter. Although the fact that it was piping hot made up for the freezing cold table's locale.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the food. 1 star (I am GENEROUSLY rounding up) ... Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) were anything but crispy. Soggy. Lackluster. I could make better! Pho dac biet. Broth tasted like it came from the can. The beef seemed to have a slight soapy taste. (odd, huh?) And I asked for jalepenos (is this a West-coast thing?? .. because the waitress said they don't have fresh peppers!!) Doh! For a spice-loving girl, this was total disappointment.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"So after I realized (yet again) that Pho Bosa was closed on Wednesday, and Hue Thai was closed due to a power outage, we ran across the street to give Pho Hung a shot.  Special Combination Pho (Large): The soup was pretty bland, but was edible and passible for Pho.  Soup with Shrimp, Fish Balls, and Chicken Leg: chicken soup with egg noodles, 2 small halves of fish ball, 2 overdone shrimp, and 2 small (quail, I think) boiled eggs. Hmm.. \"Where is my chicken?\" is what I would have asked had the server ever come back to check on the table.   When we went to pay our bill, that we had to chase down the server to get, we were charged $3.75 for a soda that on the menu read $2. When we asked to have it corrected, and I finally pointed out that my soup didn't have the chicken leg that was described in the menu, we were fought tooth and nail about the price discrepancy. Apparently, the menu items and prices had changed and they no longer offered the chicken leg, and have since replaced it with the 2 small eggs, \"didn't you see the eggs I added to your soup?!\" Sure I saw, but I would have appreciated to have been told when I had ordered that the menu item had changed and I would have changed my order. We were also told that they were forced to raise the prices on their soft drink offerings (by almost double?!) when there was no service to provide refills. They eventually caved on the soda, but never apologized for any of the inconvenience. I left pretty hungry- I barely had any protein in my soup.   I was in between giving this place 2-3 stars while we were dining, because of the ordinary and bland food and lack of service, but the interaction afterward really left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't ever go back, and wouldn't suggest this place to anyone I know. I don't know that I'd ever been so infuriated by a restaurant before.   Food was okay, but the service was what made it awful."}
{"text":"This is my usual go to spot before heading back to LA. A lot has changed since my last visit. Ordered broken rice this time, #31.  I immediately noticed the flavor and taste was not there. Upon further inspection, I noticed they used whole grain rice instead of broken rice, and there was no shredded pork (\"bi\") in my meal, as I ordered. I called the waitress over to inquire about my order.  Waitress said they ran out of broken rice and shredded pork.  Umm, shouldn't she have let me know upon taking my order? Further more, the rice plates comes with a bowl of soup (pho broth).  The flavor was so bland I took one sip of it and that was it.  Looks like this will be the last time here. One extra star for attentive service."}
{"text":"I don't even live in Toronto any more but I feel like I should send some love to Pho Hung.  I went to the Royal Conservatory of Music for two years and during my second year the RCM on Bloor street reopened.  I went to Pho Hung probably once a week for the entire year.  I'm no Pho connoisseur so I can't vouch for its authenticity but I know that the vermicelli noodles with spring rolls on top were just delicious.  And pretty cheap!  The wait staff people started noticing me as a regular and would give me preference whenever I came in with groups (usually friends visiting town).  Nice!  I'm kinda drooling thinking about Pho Hung right now.  Yes my 5 star review is a little over-enthusiastic but it's more to do with nostalgia.  This is the official cheap-dinner location of the Royal Conservatory of Music."}
{"text":"This is a farewell review for Pho Hung.  The place closes the end of this month (June 2012) to make space for more condos, because you know, this city doesn't have enough condos.  Fast service, reliable food, suprisingly extensive menu and decent prices, you couldn't ask for more from someone trying to survive law school on a budget.  Heartbroken to find a sign on the door the other day stating you were closing (and not opening another location nearby).   Best of luck to the owners and staff."}
{"text":"Gross. We picked this restaurant because the others were so packed and we were starving. The inside decor is pretty, a bit overdone. I suggest for them to use that money and energy on the food. I ordered a small pho with meatballs which is $8.75. What I received was one meatball cut into 5 pieces. Usually one bowl of pho will fill me up and this bowl only did half of the job, sigh. I know it's a small but that portion is inadequate. The soup flavor was tasteless but at least it was warm and fully cooked. Would I come here again? I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"Food quality is lousy - service is both unresponsive and unprofessional and the cliente is extremely unfriendly. This shoud sum it up ~ would never return."}
{"text":"I'm terrible with the names of people I just meet, and forget about remembering the names of dishes at any restaurant. So, when I go for pho, I usually just scan the menu for a combination of these key words: \"rare beef\", \"soup\", and \"noodles\". Or, on the Pho Hung order sheet: \"Quantity: 1, Description: #3 - Large, Cost: $10.00\". Wait. It's not worth remembering. In my opinion it's over-priced for the quality of its broth alone.  All you need to remember is: #18 - Large, Cost: I forget, but something close to $10-12? #18 consists of braised beef and carrots in a ginger and tomato-based  broth, served over rice or noodles. It's apparent that Pho Hung prepares the stew by cooking it for a long time over low heat, since the usually inexpensive ingredients (e.g. large, older carrots) and \"low-quality\", tougher cuts of meat are rendered sweet and tender, respectively. It was unnecessary to use any of the typical condiments (e.g. hoisin and hot sauce), as the broth was flavourful enough carry forth the often bland starch base of the meal. I had the noodles, but the stew is equally delicious on rice. I would have given 3-stars to Pho Hung just for the great view from its large 2nd story window across from the ROM, the convenient location, and quick service. But it's #18 that makes me want to go eat there (as opposed to just another pit stop)."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for the past 5 yrs and although there's new management,  and you can slightly taste the diff in the food is still good.  We've always redirected good friendly welcoming service and it's nice when stag and management recognizes us as soon as we walk in.  They always hey or orders right and the pho broth is always on point in taste and heat temperature."}
{"text":"I first found this restaurant when they first opened and had a great time there with great food.  Good tasting/friendly service.  Last trip there was a flop.  Pho was lacking and 6 people in our party orded rice dishes.  The meat was mediocre and the tau-hu-ky smelled.  No one finished their soup and we couldn't eat the rice dishes.  I vow not to ever go back there."}
{"text":"Pho Hung has the dubious honour of being the reason for my first review; it is one of the worst Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in the city, and I love my pho!  The only reason why I go back and why it rates 2 stars rather than 1 is due to its location.  In that little area right across from the ROM, it's the closest thing to me when I'm incredibly desperate for that quick fix of hot, slurpy rice noodle with rare beef and tendon.  For pho in Toronto, it's overpriced (priced according to its central location, I suppose), a large pho here is more like a medium everywhere else, and don't try to scrutinize the low quality meat ingredients too closely.  The avocado shake I had was akin to thin, watery melted ice cream - definitely not the expected thick delicious beverage it's supposed to be.  Finally, one time, while I was sitting near the kitchen waiting for take out, I saw one of the waiters use his fingers to take the basil that was not eaten from a side dish of bean sprouts and place it on an outgoing plate to another diner.  Yum!"}
{"text":"this place is kinda like my home away from home (Little Saigon).  their bunh rieu is sooo good.  there's only a few places that i can comment with confidence about this particular dish, and this makes my top 3 BUN RIEU LIST.    the soup is not too salty and does not have too much of the reddish oily stuff floating on top .  you get a good helping of deep fried tofu and the minced crab (usually it's minced crab & meat).  of course, a side of veggies gets mounded on before the start of the meal so you get your whole 5 servings of veggies in this one meal here.  I've been here on several occasions, where i've tried pho, bun rieu, and the broken rice with pork dish.    their menu is quite expansive -- serving more than \"pho\" as their name proclaims.   the service is pretty good, and the establishment is rather clean.  it's just a little bit away from the strip, but you get good unpretentious vietnamese food that's not gonna make you sell the clothes off your back just to dine.  give them a try!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided to try a new pho spot since our usual late night spot always has a wait time. While the service was fine, nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible, the food was just not up to par. Our shrimp appetizer came out after our pho and was hot tasty. The pho was also bland.  The main reason we won't be going back anytime soon has to do with the extremely loud band playing. Granted, we probably should have noted before walking in that the lights were low and there was a stage set up, but goodness! I couldn't hear myself slurping noodles, let alone have a conversation.   If in a bind, I may go back, but not if I can help it."}
{"text":"Been a regular to this place for a few years now, the first time I came here I was blown away by the flavors of their broth and have since made it my go to spot for pho. Throughout the years, I seen many employees come and go and I hate to say this but this place has lost its luster. I agree with a lot of people on how after being served, the waiters just forgets about you. The service keeps on getting worse as time goes by and what made me keep returning to this place is that maybe I would get that one more chance to dine here like I used too with excellent food and good service.  Now me and my fiancé will now be hunting for our new pho place."}
{"text":"Pho Hung is by far my least favorite pho place in Las Vegas.   The temperature of the broth was lukewarm at best, and when I go to eat pho I look forward to the piping hot broth. It was also pretty tasteless. I'm not one to add many sauces to my bowl but definitely had to when I ate here. The brisket was also not very consistent.   I also got an order of egg rolls. The good thing was that it came with more egg rolls than most other pho places. Bad news - I didn't really want to eat any of it after the first couple of bites. They were soggy, and did not seem fresh at all.   Service was bad as well. There was one other group in the restaurant besides mine, and yet I couldn't seem to get my water refilled."}
{"text":"Had a large family lunch. The staff forced us to use a small table when there was no one else and larger tables available. I asked for their special without vegetables or tendon. Needless to say I had to spend time picking out those things. Air conditioning wasn't functioning, it would have been nice to know beforehand with a sign posted at the door. Kept running out of water. As I write this review our finished plates and bowls of food have not been removed and have been sitting on the table for 10 mins. Food wasn't bad but wasn't the greatest either. Won't be returning here."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch before driving back to Sacramento. A friend of ours raved about how great their rice plates were. I ordered the shaken beef rice plate (bo luc lac) and all I can say is that I was NOT IMPRESSED! The rice was dry and the beef was overly cooked. The server (possibly the owner) kept tell using us that everything on the menu was \"very very good\"! Definitely a place I would never go to ever again!  If I had the option to give this place a zero star...I would!"}
{"text":"location location location.  is the only benefit for this place which has THE worst pho in Toronto.  If you'll read the good reviews the only reason why they rate it 3+ is: -location (have to walk another 20 minutes for viet -reminiscing of student past- cheap food (not where near quality though)- and people love their old student ghettos -they don't know pho at all.  so sorry, pho hung. you have  -disgusting cuts of cheap meat -terrible service, or there lack of -terrible attitudes   I feel for some of the servers- they are ok.  the older woman though?  Terrible at accommodating even after the servers said it was no problem."}
{"text":"ok so this place is just another location for the pho hung in chinatown. but for some reason feels like two totally different places.  some dishes are different. the portions are smaller in this location. and the staff is definitely more attentive to you in this particular location.  hmm not sure why I still go more often to the chinatown location. haha but yeah good place overall!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch or dinner and have a comfortable conversation with a friend. Almost as good an environment as a coffee shop.  Have to order two dishes on the menu if you want to share though."}
{"text":"Ignore the haters. The vegetarian pho is delicious and cheap as balls. The customer service is fine. Don't come here if you're expecting five-star fancy-date dining, but if you're happy with quick, no-frills, cheap, fresh foods, this is the place."}
{"text":"This place has seemingly gone downhill the last few times I've been here. The broth used to be flavorful and now it is almost tasteless, although the noodles and meat were good. We were here for about 45 min and there were no other diners at about 5:30 pm on a Sunday night. 1 other customer walked in to pick up a take out order and that was about it. Service is lacking and once they take your order, they never return until your food comes out and after that you'll never see a server ever again. When we sat a while and didn't get our bill, we just walked up and paid which was kind of odd. Guess they weren't worried since there were no other customers there. The large bowls are still priced at $7.50 which is a killer deal in my opinion. Hopefully this was just a bad night for them but I may start looking for other options before I come back here again."}
{"text":"My family and I came in to grab a quick meal before going to the Royal Ontario Museum right across the street. Just like Brenda S. mentioned, it is a bit tricky to get into because it's not located right on street level.  As we were seated, the server left us menus and an order ticket on the table. He didn't give us any direction so we weren't sure whether we were supposed to write down our order or wait for him to come back to take it. After some time passed, he came back (maybe after seeing our confused looks) and took our order.  I decided to order curry chicken with lemongrass and boy was it delicious! I've had curry hundreds of times before but never with lemongrass. It gave the dish a really interesting flavor and I'm dying to try it again once I find it served on a menu. I ordered the small portion but it definitely was enough to share. In my case though, it was so good I finished the whole plate!  According to Jennifer L. and checking their website, this location is unfortunately now closed as of June 27th. Luckily there are two other locations still open to give them a try!"}
{"text":"Good service. Clean environment. Filtered/reverse osmosis water.  Enormous size in Pho and I was able to use egg noodles instead of rice noodles; which is a plus. Very good fried egg rolls.   Descent prices.  Great selection in soups and other items on menu...I think I found my new Vietnamese place!"}
{"text":"I would give it 1 star, but it gets a bonus point for location.  Maybe its deteriorated. Maybe I'm just more picky about my Pho.   But...  I got a small House Special bowl, and I literally finished the whole thing in 3 or 4 spoonfuls. There was not enough meat or noodles in there. There was no Tripe. Even my friend's XL bowl did not have enough meat to noodles ratio. It just seems like they just fill up a large bowl with more soup.   The meal didn't come with a Chinese soup spoon, it was really hard to eat it  with a regular spoon.   The waiter working there was grumpy with no sense of humor.  I think he snarled at me when I asked if he could cut our long spring rolls in half (like they are supposed to!). He came back with a knife.   The vent right above us started to fill the air with cigarette smoke as we were about to leave. I think it's people in the back that are smoking. It's disgusting that I have to smell 2nd hand smoke from so far away and in side!  1 Small, 1 XL pho, and 1 shredded pork roll (which was dry and the sauce tasted like soap) = $20 including taxes.   The tea was cold too.   If it wasn't for the location, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Where the locals go! A must if you are a local or are tourist with a rental car. Huge portions and at great prices! Tried the Shrimp Pho (so many shrimp and large amount of noodles!), sweet and sour chicken (best I've ever had!) and Kung Pao Calamari (so yummy!). Can't wait to go back! Check out their menu online. They have 195 items!"}
{"text":"So I gave this a try... the worst mistake ever was not checking the yelp reviews before giving it a chance.  This place had no chance with me in my books!   First off their live music was loud as hell...  the food was overpriced.  So I thought for the price it better be good. It was all bad.  Spring rolls were dry and lacking all the usual ingredients and flavor.  I asked for a large pho and I got a small.  They did not have my usual satay garlic oil chili sauce.  The waiter insisted the sauce I was speaking about was the fishy shrimp sauce.  The broth had no flavor and adding more sauces did not help the taste at all.  Overpriced. Overated and a disappointment.  It was just sucky if u asked me down the whole line complete fail!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are such low ratings for this place.  Just went there after picking up my brother for a late night dinner.  He had a bowl of pho and I had the grilled pork chops.  First of all, I got good service.  Were checked in several times while there.  The broth of the pho had good flavor and the ingredients seemed to be fresh.  Broth was better than Saigon 8.  The porkchop was nicely seasoned, a little dry, but the portions were good on both.  Oh yeah, the spring rolls were nice w/ shrimp and pork in there.   The prices were right."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago and it was good so I decided to come back and try it since I am here for asd. The owner talked to me for a bit, she is a nice lady and told me how the workers they hired before weren't so good so there were a lot of bad reviews. She is there all the time now to make sure things are good. I got the pho one day and the egg noodle the next. Both were good."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews here from 2007 and 2008 are entirely inaccurate and outdated at this point.  Although this restaurant is not as well attended and is probably about 50-75 cents more per bowl of pho, it is well worth it.  While the average pho restaurant has loud customers practically sitting on top of you, the atmosphere at Pho Hung is relaxing and serene.  I'll have to admit I could do without the Vietnamese variety shows that are on at times.  Having eaten pho for over 20 years now, I think Pho Hung serves up dishes that are tasty and contain highest quality herbs and ingredients."}
{"text":"Firstly, I lived in Vietnam in 2003-2004 and am familiar with all types of Vietnamese cuisine (I make my own and go out to eat Viet at least 1-2 times a week).  This is perhaps the most overrated Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto.  The portions are smaller and costs more than at other restaurants.  I paid $9 for a bowl of noodles on Spadina.  That is simply outrageous.  The menu is vast, as it is at most Vietnamese restaurants.  Normally very busy and loud.  Service is typical of this type of food genre.  The Pho - broth is very good, though fresh noodles are not used.  The portion size is smaller here than at most Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.  The Fish Sauce (which is served with everything not labeled 'pho')- not strong enough in my opinion, seems diluted -- as is the hoisin sauce.  There are a number of better places on Spadina/Dundas, though if you are on Bloor, it may be the only option."}
{"text":"Pho Hung has been my go-to Vietnamese place around the Bloor/University area since my undergrad days at U of T.  The food is solid and arrives very quickly at your table.  I always get the special beef noodle soup, which is well-sized with a good amount and variety of toppings.  The service is atrociously laissez-faire.   They get the job done, but it ain't service with a smile.  The decor is definitely in need of a refresh as well, but, as others have said, is basically clean.    I think Pho Hung could use some competition to up it's game and offer better food, service and ambiance in the area.  However, it's a solid place to get your dose of Pho and other Viet dishes at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for turning me onto this place! A super authentic place that serves you tea (hot or cold depending on the outside temp!) the second you walk in. Also, to add to the authentic-ness there are fresh chili peppers waiting for the brave. I've tried multiple pho dishes and the spring rolls all were great; everyone I've brought here also really enjoyed the place.  TIP: order the small pho for one, or get a larger one and split it, they'll bring you extra bowls if you ask!"}
{"text":"I love this pho restaurant. The pho here is amazing, and you have your standard Vietnamese menu. I always go with the beef ball pho. The portions are very generous, and the broth is always on point. Everything is cooked to perfection on the pho side things. I have never had a non-pho dish here, so I cannot comment on the menu items. The restaurant is usually empty during the day which makes it nice for a quiet and intimate lunch or dinner. It doesn't really get busy until later at night when karaoke kicks off and the party gets started. The servers are all extremely nice and very helpful. Overall, this place is great. It is very authentic and great for a quick cheap bite."}
{"text":"I and my husband ate for lunch this place last week. (i forgot hunting at yelp ). staff  friendly, and room beautifful and clean, design food beautifull, but taste the food we upset.  the food  no good, bun bo hue soup  no hot ,different taste i think different ingredient .no taste lemongrass and to much star anise. broken rice with  BBQ pork different too, broken rice very soft,i think to much some water, and BBQ beef  no good and no hot ,no flavour i think beef shank slice. price no worth it with the food, expensive than we ate vietnam restaurant ."}
{"text":"Went out with a group of friends here for dinner. One had been before and quite enjoyed his meal. My experience was quite disappointing. I don't recall the exact name of the dish I ordered, but it was something with beef and thick noodles.  At least, it should have been with beef. The bowl was quite large, but it turned out most of the \"beef\" was fat and bone. The rest was tasty enough, but considering the size if the portion, I left still hungry.  That said, everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, perhaps I just had bad luck. I'd be willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"The pho was barely hot and some of the rare beef was still pink as the broth cooled.  They give you a pre-dispensed serving of hoisin and sriracha sauce, so that if you want more, you'll have to ask.  The small really is small compared to other pho places downtown.  I suspect this place survives mainly through their proximity to U of T.  One server seems friendly and upbeat, but the others are indifferent.  The view of Bloor might be great, but I'd rather have tasty food."}
{"text":"My friend decided to try this place out since we've been to most of the Pho places on Spring Mountain.  Pho Hung is a little bit farther away from all of the hustle and bustle.  We were here in the morning around 10ish.  The restaurant was practically empty which was not a good sign.  We should have ran out of this place right away but fools that we were, we sucked up and sat down.    Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  But that's about it.  I ordered beef stew with baguette, but they didnt have any baguette.  They didn't have time to drive to Lee's Sandwiches.  So I ordered their spicy beef noodles, our waitress said they didn't have it today.  I ended up with crab meat noodle soup per the waitress' recommendation.    We also ordered rice with grilled pork chop and eggrolls, beef noodle (pho bo), crab meat noodle (bun rieu), chicken noodle (pho ga).  The pork chop was burned and dry.  It looked like it's been around for a few days.  The eggrolls were very funky looking and orange.  My crab meat made it into little patties and deep fried.  I've never had it deep fried before and it just did not taste good.  Their beef noodle was ok.  However, it didn't make up for the rest of the order.  I have to give it 1.5 star.    This review was written per my hubby's request because I wasn't planning to write one, hence, no photos.  Maybe I should go back next time just for the photos.... yeah right!"}
{"text":"Pho Hung is a decent place if you're looking for Pho downtown but definitely nothing special. Being a franchise doesn't help either, the staff they hire don't really care. Case in point: My friends took out a birthday boy for dinner here as they were a large group and they had made him a cake. One member of the group went and asked the \"waiter\" for a bunch of plates for the cake and he fully just yelled to the kitchen \"just give me a bunch of dirty plates for these people\" (obviously not in english, but my friend understood exactly what he was yelling). She let him know that she knew what he said and he grudgingly just grabbed a bunch of plates.  Other than that the pho is okay - I've had much better but it's a convenient spot and holy crap they raised their prices. It's nearing the point where it's almost not worth it to go."}
{"text":"So after all the chaos in Phoenix, we were back in Vegas. It was a little after Midnight and we were in the mood for a big bowl of noodles.....Ramen was plan A, Pho was plan B.  So we drive past Monta Ramen which was closed, so we drove up to this spot where I've dined before, and we get their Combination Pho, loaded with beef, pork, tripe, and tendon.  It totally hit the spot, piping hot and full with flavor with a lot of goodies... we were just glad to be back in Vegas and also appreciated how \"spoiled' we are with all these food choices in the Silver State...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Affordable, tasty and serving size is generous. Today I came in to order their infamous fried tofu and fried egg rolls to go. While driving I could smell the aroma and im just dying to have a bite! Once I got home and had a bite of the tofu first, it was dry and had no flavor what so ever then I tried the egg rolls it tasted horrible like a rotten fried fish. Thats not the only disappointing part of it I only ordered appetizers and was charhed $23.62!!! Wow!! I could have gone to a kbbq and ate AYCE with that price!!! I'm soooo dissatisfied with this order. I'm never coming back unless they change how they cook their food and lower their charges its too expensive!!"}
{"text":"When craving an ice cold Tra Da (Ice Tea)  and a tasty bowl of PHO to cure your hang over from the night before,  this is the place to be.   1. Super Attentive & Courteous Staff 2. Speedy Service 3. Variety of Tasty Vietnamese Food  Not to mention, they are beer/liquored licensed... =)"}
{"text":"I always drive by spring mountain and saw this place has $4.95 special and been wanting to try it out so today I went and order a pork chop with rice. I waited and waited for 35mins!!! and food still have not came. I ask the server where's my food? He said ok and walk off .. I wait another 5 min and I'm out the door.. Never ever ever forever am I coming back here ever never again. Wasted 40mins of my life"}
{"text":"They kept saying everything was out of order. But understandable it was new year day. The pho is good."}
{"text":"This place is suck. I ordered two of their specialty items and they are really bad. Will not coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Though it's not the best pho and spring rolls I've ever had, it's not bad.  Pretty decent.  The prices are okay.  You do get a pretty big portion for what you pay for.  The only thing I'm not happy about is the service.  The first time I went there it was okay at first, then more than one person began serving us and ended up getting our orders mixed up.  Once we were served, we were forgotten.  And we were one of two parties in the restaurant.  The second time I dined alone and was served very quickly even though the restaurant was full for the lunch crowd.  So I was happy about that.  But again, once I was served, I was forgotten.  I wasn't able to get a refill on water until I was almost done and the huge bus load was gone.  This is Vegas, and it's summer.  We need to stay hydrated.  So overall, the food is good, as well as the prices and portions.  But the service isn't that great."}
{"text":"The quality here isn't up to par. (judging by the vermicelli and pho)  If you want a relatively cheap and quick meal, then go for it. But don't expect too much.  I think it's declined in the past 4-5 years"}
{"text":"8 of us stopped for lunch after hiking today.  Most of us ordered the #12, pho with beef brisket.  An error was made when one of the group wanted porridge but was served #23 (vegetarian spring roll over noodles) by error.  It was removed from the bill but he kept the dish and liked it very much.  The only complaint I had with the brisket was it was uneven.  There were several flat slices of brisket, but here were also some hard pieces of beef that were tough.    I had their Vietnamese coffee.  It was good, but I've had better elsewhere.  I do like the open nature of the room and the modern decor.  Service was very good, except for the slip up noted.    We enjoyed ourselves very much."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad.  The food was below average.  The menu is really hard to follow and is missing things you usually see at every Vietnamese place like bun.  The broth was quite greasy which is unusual.  There was weird TV with loud music playing all over.  Big signs outside announced under new management - which could be good or bad.  It was very difficult to communicate with the waiter who was sort of rude.  When we came in he just pointed in a direction as if to say sit somewhere over there.  I think he was trying, but this place needs work.  The food came out quick and it was the right temperature - unfortunately not enough to get me to come back any time soon.  I've eaten a lot of pho.  This was average at best."}
{"text":"i must say i'm surprised at the abundance of poor reviews for this restaurant! i wandered in here recently and had a small number 3. it came quickly and was delicious. beef was perfectly rare. they didn't cheap out on it. broth was yummy. my buddy took me here like .... 5 years ago, upon his recommendation. no regrets!  of course, service isn't exactly 5-star treatment ... but yes, it's an asian place so their philosophies are different. it's brisk and to the point, but i didn't ever quite find it rude. food is good, cheap, clean. sounds like a standard pho restaurant to me!"}
{"text":"tip:  Opens at 9am, not many chinese joints open at this time which is great for early risers who don't want pho kim long or other 24 hour places.  Broth good, not oily, but small bowl too small for 7.75.  good decor, has a whole row of fish tanks with arowanas which is great."}
{"text":"AWESOME!! Now, let me mind you, I only go out for Pho when the weather is anything but sunny and hot. On these rare occasions of weather I will always go to Pho Hung. The Pho is never disappointing and I always get the pork and shrimp spring rolls to go with which are always amazing. The service has never disappointed. Their prices are a lil on the higher side (for Pho anyway) a small is $7.00 and the large is $7.50. I always get a small #13 while my bf will ocassionally get the large along with the springrolls and our bill is never over $20. DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"2nd time back.  Last one was about 5 months ago.  I ordered the special Pho (#01) again but went for the XL size.  It was basically the same as my previous review (see below) but with more noodles.  Darnit, forgot to get spring rolls instead!    Won't be coming back.  *******************************************************************  I ordered the large Pho which had everything in it (#1 I think) and the shrimp salad roll.  The size of the large isn't really a large compared to places that I have been to in Vancouver.  I felt that the restaurant didn't give enough noodles.    The taste of the soup was ok but not great.  I really liked the meats, tripe and tendon that they used.  It was really soft and tender.  The shrimp salad roll was sub-par.  The rolls seemed small and didn't have too much flavor.  Was quite disappointed.  The restaurant wasn't busy at 6:30pm when I got there.  I find it funny that I was given a metal spoon and NOT a clay asian spoon that I am so used to.    Price for the food is good.  I would come back but would order the extra large and try the spring rolls."}
{"text":"this place is a real disappointment.   the restaurant itself is decorated very nicely and the waiters are very nice and sweet but i've honestly never been to a restaurant where they messed up on EVERYTHING.  first off, we came in with a party of 5 and she placed us at a tiny booth. we did sit down but we stared at each other awkwardly and then began to position ourselves at a regular table.   secondly, she came to take our order and i asked if the shakes were \"fresh\" meaning if they use real fruits and not the nasty powder that is used at pho kim long and she said YES it's fresh, so my friend ordered one. when our drinks came out (which came out AFTER our food...) there was 1 avocado shake with pearls and 1 without. there was a total of 6 drinks brought out and only 5 people. she said that we ordered it....now why would we order 6 drinks? when there's only 5 people? the waitress came out and said that I ordered it. i was a little surprised because all i asked was \"are the shakes fresh\" and she assumed that i wanted an avocado shake with pearls LOL.   third, i asked for limes and the limes brought out were SO DRY!!!! i seriously had to squeeze the shit out of it in order to get 2 or 3 drops. this is why i asked for MORE limes and still the second batch were dry as hell!!   fourth, they messed up on our bill. they charged us for big bowls of pho...which is correct because that's what we ordered BUT they brought out SMALL bowls of pho. and they also charged us for that extra pearl drink. -_-  now for the pho: we seriously could not eat it. the only reason why i asked for so much lime is because the pho soup is SOOOOOOO SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!! too much msg???????? all of us were dying from a bad hangover or lack of sleep and we really needed pho. we skipped pho kim long because their service sucks and the pho is okay...we wanted BOMB ass pho but we made a big mistake coming here= [. we all agreed that the pho is too sweet so i'm pretty sure it wasn't just me (who happens to be just a little bit picky...) the small pho is really small and i'm pretty sure i would have finished it but because it was too sweet and the noodles were over cooked, i wasn't able to finish it.   would i ever come back?!?! hell nooooo."}
{"text":"I heart Pho Hung.  Altho it's located on Bloor, it's a bit hard to find because it's upstairs.  The decor is nothing special, but it's clean, the food is delicious, the menu is huge, and the prices are very reasonable.  The meat here is also not at all sketchy, which is nice because before I became a vegetarian I was extremely picky about the meat/chicken I would eat.  It's yummy and definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area.  Plus, it's close to shopping and the ROM."}
{"text":"This restaurant was opened in 2007, in the height of the Vegas boom times and housing bubble, when pricesof everything was going up and up, and money was flowing easily. Million dollar condos going up everywhere, speculators betting on housing prices getting lucky more than rolling the dice at the craps table. IThe time was like rolling 11's consecutively and parlaying your bet....the odds were long (18 - 1, but pays 15 - 1) but it just kept coming in to pay.   So a great Pho restaurant owning family from the Portland area, (they own several popular ones in the Pacific northwest) decided to roll the dice in Vegas, They spared no expense in the decor. It is decorated with all high end materials, with marble-like tables, 2 large flat screens, and a lot of quality to make a very clean and pleasant restaurant. The problem is, it is too far from the Strip, out on Spring Mountain a mile from the strip at Decatur in the A&M strip mall. And that long odds 11 crapped out, the housing bubble burst, and Vegas is hurting.   One of the owners was the cashier the night I went, and she was very friendly and accomodating, asking what I wanted to watch on the flat screens.  We had a nice long talk after my meal about Vietnam, Saigon back then, where her family is from, now Ho Chi Minh city under the communists now. They own a restaurant back there, called Pho 99, at 139 Duong Nguyn Trai, Phuong Ben, Thanh Quan 1, T/P Ho Chi MInh, Viet Nam. There is one in Portland called Pho Hung.  I ordered my standard over the past year, Pho Tai Nam. The beef was good and the broth was, too. Plenty of fresh greens to go with it.  The price was more like glitzy Vegas, not the grungy pacific northwest. Bonus: they accept credit cards, which most grungy dives do not."}
{"text":"Not happy with my pho!!! A simple request as to not include onions in my pho wasn't even met! I was told by the guy to pick them out myself. A BIG WTF!!! The lights went out midway during my meal... because apparently there was a birthday party and people were singing nonstop on stage. Not exactly a family oriented restaurant. My family couldn't even speak to each other without yelling... otherwise we could only see each other's lips move. Not coming back. There's better pho places in Vegas who actually listens when the customer requests for no onions. UGH."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my friend. She said she's been here more than a couple of times and she said it's good. So I said why not, lets try it. We came in, it was very very slow. We were the only customers. And this is during lunch time which is normally noon. Right as we walk in we were greeted by a lady that could barely speak english let along understand english.   We got to choose our seat, the booth. We were given menus and 3 minutes later the same lady came back and took our orders. I wanted a small at first but when she came back with our waters that definitely tasted like tap water....I changed my mind to get a large because I wanted to take some home for my boyfriend. She couldnt understand me at all, I said it at least five times that I wanted a large and then she just walked away and got another lady that could unserstand...so I told her what I wanted. So probably five minutes later we got our sprites which is pretty much filled with ice to the top..and we got our orders as well my friend (shrimp pho) mine (vegetable pho).   Our food got to our table pretty quick. Like it wasnt even ten minutes. As I was taking a sip of my soup and eating my vegetables I noticed at least 10 of my vegetables had dirt on them, they were literally turning black already like they were rotting in the fridge and the kitchen still wanted to serve these vegetables. I picked them out and put them on another plate. I could say out of all my vegetables I didnt eat one cabbage at all because there was black stuff on them....like how unappealing! No one wants to eat food with black stuff on them. The broth was good but what really grossed me out was the vegetables that were already turning black!!!   I don't think I'll come back here again. It's way overpriced for bad pho, with vegetables literally rotting in my pho. I don't want that and I dont think people should even be eating that!! that's not healthy at all. Yes they do have an A rating, but that's useless and basically fake if your vegetables and food in the kitchen are rotting and you still serve it to customers! That's just a health hazard! Who knows what else they serve that is rotting. This place needs to live up to better standards. Maybe THEN I will come back and try their pho again.....but not for awhile. I can't stand looking at my vegetables all dirty and rotting in my soup."}
{"text":"Stars are only for the food. We all know service is always horrible at asian restaurant and that is why I only tip 10% now. The lunch special poster caught my eye so ordered the #2 from the poster and egg rolls to go with it. Whoa, egg roll was deep fat fried so it was amazing, but only got 3, which was odd since other places gives 4. As for the #2 lunch special, it was pork chop with rice plate, which you only get 1 pork chop with veggies. The meat smelled kind of old so I ate the rice and veggie instead. Rice plate 1 star, egg rolls 4 stars. Total 2 stars. I will try the pho next time if i can get myself to come back. Hopefully..."}
{"text":"Strip mall parking.  The place was well advertised and noticeable from the street.  The place had plenty of seating and was decorated better than most.  The bar appeared well stocked.  The service was a bit slow.  The food was really good.  I had  #13, which is soup with thinly sliced meat.  The vegetables were fresh and plentiful.  The broth was delicious and hot.  The meat had too much fat on it.  My friend is vegetarian and complained that there vegetarian dishes were few and the one he got sucked.  The prices were reasonable.  My bowl of soup cost $7.50 and it was very filling.  I would go back, but I still prefer Pho Kim Long or Pho So 1."}
{"text":"The apps were great but the pho broth was surprisingly tasteless. There were quite a few veggie choices. The fried tofu in the pho was yummy. Also the service was good."}
{"text":"I want to start reversing the reputation of this place. We keep saying that this restaurant IS CLEAN! Cleanliness is HUGE in my dining experience. I would rather go to a decent tasting Pho place but CLEAN than go to the one that taste good but filthy.  What's with all the complaints? Here are the perks of Pho Hung: 1. Best imperial rolls in all of Las Vegas. Wrapped in traditional rice paper.  2. I love the gan in the Pho. Wonderfully soft and fresh.  3. Clean as a whistle for a Pho joint. 4. I'm not embarrass taking people to this restaurant especially those new to Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I like the cleanliness and the decor is just amazing. They really took the time to design the interior of this restaurant with materials imported from Vietnam. You will not be embarrassed to take a date, your friends, or family here.  As far as food I enjoyed the spring rolls and do like their Pho. Their servings are generous and the broth tasted really good. I wasn't too impressed with their crepe. We all loved the coconut with the jelly inside. I'm not a big dessert fan but boy this was quite enjoyable. So if I'm in Vegas and crave a good pho this is my place.  Owner was very friendly and I was surprised their prices were almost the same as the whole in wall places we go to in LA."}
{"text":"Dashed in here with hubby and friends in between lectures at a U of T symposium.  It's on the third floor and not accessible. You go up one flight of stairs outdoors, over a couple of closed restaurants, and then one more flight indoors.  It seems a little shabby, but bright and cheerful nonetheless. Big windows overlook Bloor Street and the ROM. Everything looks a little on the old side but is essentially clean.  Because we were in a hurry, we didn't want a full meal. We ordered three entrees -- hubby and I shared a large bun with shrimp, R had some kind of multi-meat bun, and S had a fried egg and pork on rice. The large servings are shareable if you want a light meal, and the small servings looked to be pretty filling for one person. The food was fast, and really fresh and tasty. The waiter kept our teapot full too. The fish sauce is probably house made, as it was in a many-times-used sriracha bottle.  With just entrees, no dessert or beverages, the four of us ate for under $30. Can't beat that. Note that you can only use plastic if you order more than $10. I'm only rating this place as low as I am because of the inaccessibility and the general shabbiness. But I have a soft spot for holes-in-the-wall with great food, and I'll go again if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"one word: mediocre.     everything about this place demonstrates the word \"mediocre\".  The food, the service, the price...holy mediocre.    On the plus side, it's better than \"bad\"!  So, if you absolutely must satisfy a Vietnamese craving and can't go anywhere better, this place is not terrible.    That's the only possible reason I can think of as to why it can get so crowded.  People just HAVE to have Vietnamese and there's nothing else really nearby."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a number of times for my hour-long lunch break in between classes; the service is quick enough that the risk of getting back late is pretty low!   The coconut curry dishes are great and the stirfried rice noodles with tofu and vegetables, although a wee bit on the greasy side, always leave me satisfied.  Another reason why I like Pho Hung is that they give real Chinese tea.  This is also one of the rare places in Toronto where I can find a soursop smoothie!  Additional bonus: A lot of students visit this location, so they also do not give you any trouble if you want to split the bill up."}
{"text":"Ok.   So this place is NEVER busy! and its open real late. So already I like it because its open late, however the food well the food is alright.  The meat that they use have too much fat, especially the slices of beef, however for the price its a good deal.  The service is pretty good, and they pay attention to you, mostly because its never busy, or at least its never been busy when I go there, which is quite late most of the time..  So if its late, everything is closed, use this as a plan B most definitely. However it is a good plan B"}
{"text":"This place is across the street from the ROM and is upstairs (which was hard for my grandmother; she's 89 years young).  The write-out-your-own-order was a first for me, but it may eliminate the need to tip, so you can save a couple of bucks there.  I recommend getting a lunch special if you want the most bang for your buck.  Try to resist sitting near the window; the view isn't worth getting cooked by the sun, especially in the afternoon.  Getting a server's attention is pretty tough and I agree with another reviewer about the huffiness you get when you ask for something (an extra plate, more water, etc.).  I'm sorry, but bad attitude = no tip."}
{"text":"We were feeling adventurous and decided to stop by this place for some Pho and Cha Gio.  Like with many restaurants like this you can just order by the number on the menu.  I don't remember what the numbers were but the order was: Cha Gio Chicken & Shrimp noodle bowl  The Cha Gio was OK, not the best I've had but not the worst.  The veggies accompanying them were not very appetizing so I just avoided them.  The Chicken & Shrimp bowl was a bit disappointing.  First off, the shrimp was replaced by a Cha Gio without warning.  The Chicken was OK but nothing special.  The Vermicelli Noodles were both soggy and clumped.  The service was nice but that couldn't make up for the sticky table and chopsticks.  There was more than enough staff on hand and  it was not a busy night by far.  On to the next one."}
{"text":"I have to admit, this place sure is decorated nicely.  That said, I ordered Pho Ga and I hated it.    It was just regular beef broth with a few pieces of tough chicken thrown in.  It sucked and it made me feel nauseous afterwards.  I should have known better than to stray from my usual pho ga place but I was desperate and I was in Vegas.  My brother's pork and broken rice dish was okay, mediocre.  It might fool some but not me.  I grew up eating authentic Vietnamese food from my dad's aunt (they were born in Vietnam and lived there for many years) so this shiz does NOT, I repeat does NOT cut it.  Did I mention that the utensils were actually dirty?  As in there was still food particles stuck to it after being 'washed'?  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Despite its friendliness and cleanness, Pho Hung failed in the food category.  My Pho was lukewarm at best.  My fiance's shaken beef was small in portion and quality of beef subpar.  My mom's seafood pho was salty and, again, lukewarm.  C'mon, pipping hot broth is a MUST for Pho or else it wouldn't cook the bean sprouts, let alone the rare beef!!!  I hadn't had Pho for more than 2 months.  Pho Hung failed to revive my love for Pho.  I think I'll skip Pho all together when I am in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"Blah.  People from work really like to go here and I try something new and every time I decide to try something different.  I've not found anything that is particular good or bad, just blah.  The service tends to be a bit slow and surly.  The prices are reasonable.  The menu is HUGE.  Usually that means either there are lots of ingredients in common or the ingredients are not fresh.  Here it's both.  I'll never opt for this place considering the options around, but I won't veto it either...I'll just keep trying different things until I find the least not delicious one for me."}
{"text":"Pho Hung Restaurant was more like Pho Hung Long Wait or Pho Hung Bad Service. After getting seated, we didn't see another server for about 20 minutes (besides getting a kettle of tea and 2 small cups for a table of 6). I tried to attract someone's attention to get our orders, raising my hand, standing up. Finally, I flagged down a server carrying a tray of food to someone else's table, and was just going to ask him, \"would you be able to take our order when you get done?\" But I was reprimanded with a \"What you want me to drop this and talk???????\"    At this point, the rest of my party had been fed up with the service, or lack thereof so we got up and left.    My friends, who were already at the restaurant eating had a similar bad service experience. They ordered the spring rolls when they had ordered their food but never received the rolls. They asked the waiter if it was coming but he said that they didn't serve the spring rolls anymore...meanwhile, the table next to them were happily munching down on the same spring rolls that the resaturant apparently didn't serve anymore. Then my friends had to dispute with them to get the spring rolls of the bill that they didn't receive.    The restaurant had your typical lunch crowd but there were plenty of servers and people to take your order.  If I would give it negative stars I would rate it a negative 20 stars. I'd recommend the Pho Saigon chains...always good service with great pho."}
{"text":"If Toronto suffered from a dearth of Vietnamese restaurants I'd probably give Pho Hung 3 stars. The food is pretty good, the location is convenient, and the prices aren't ridiculously high. However, given how many better places there are out there I think 2 stars is more appropriate.  The menu is large and I went with one of several types of bun ($10.50); this one had beef, pork, spring rolls, and (of course) vermicelli noodles. While I was happy with my food I couldn't help comparing to this to bun I've had at other places. Basically at Pho Hung you're paying significantly more for a smaller portion and lower quality.  Pho Hung does have a good location going for it. The truth is there's not many good cheap places to eat in the area. Also, it's on the second floor so the view is nice if you score a seat near the window. Service is efficient.  Given how close to my work Pho Hung is I might go back for lunch but only if I was really lazy and didn't want to make the trek to Spadina."}
{"text":"A new Vietnamese restaurant that opened up on Spring Mountain about half a year ago or so, we were pleasantly surprised by the interior decorations of this restaurant.  It doesn't look like your typical Vietnamese joint with fancy booths and furniture.  This is actually their second location, their first being in Portland, Oregon!  We started off our dinner with #21 Tau Hu Ki (\"Fried tofu wrap stuffed with fish, shrimp, and crab. 2 for 1 order\") $5.50.  It came with fresh greens and pickled carrots and radishes with a dipping sauce.  Pretty tasty stuff.  And we chose this based on the picture!   We also shared the #39 Banh Xeo (\"Vietnamese pancake\") $7.00.  It's labeled as a meal for one, and it definitely is!  It's loaded with lots of bean sprouts, shrimp, and some other stuff. It's also served with greens and a dipping sauce.  Pretty tasty and I would suggest sharing it with someone and getting an additional dish as well.  It's a hardy order of a pancake.  For my own dinner order, I got the #1 Tai, Nam, Gau, Gan, Sach (\"Eye of round steak, well-done flank, fat brisket, soft tendon and honeycomb tripe.), size small $6.50.  It was loaded with lots of noodles, which is a good thing.  I actually didn't finish my order because I was so stuffed (from all the appetizers too).  Another friend ordered the #2 Chin, Nam, Gau, Gan, Sach (\"Well-done brisket, well-done flank, fat brisket, soft tendon and honeycomb tripe.\"), size small $6.50.  She was pretty happy with her order overall.  The BF ordered his favorite, the #35 Mi Bo Kho (\"Stewed beef with egg noodles.\") $7.00.  He finished up his whole bowl and I must admit, pretty good flavor in there.  The BF also got the #78 Sinh To Bo (\"Fresh avocado shake\") $3.50 to go, and it was yummy!   Service - our original waiter was coming around a lot to make sure we were okay.  Then I think we were forgotten about after that.  We had to wave the waiter down when we wanted our bill as he couldn't see us in our booth.  Food was pretty good overall and the ambiance is quite nice.  They refill your water with a pitcher that has orange slices in it, which is a nice touch.  I think we'll be going back!"}
{"text":"They are now open late til 2am. It was one of the few reasons why we haven't been back is that it used to close before we can ever get there. We just wanted to try something different and not go to Pho So 1 or Pho Kim Long.   We ordered Cha Gio ($5)- it's okay, but it's not quite cha gio and more like Chinese eggrolls. The meat (chicken, pork and shrimp) was shredded in it with carrot instead of more of a solid cake of ground pork, carrot and mushroom. I think I prefer it more traditional so I don't think I want to order this again.   We got a broken rice plate with bbq pork, egg casserole and shredded pork ($8.95). Everything was pretty decent. The pork was flavored nice, but the consistency reminded me of Thai pork jerky dish which I like, but wasn't expecting.    We got a combination meat pho in large ($7.50). The broth was good actually. A bit sweet which I like and I can taste anise. My one thing was that it was a bit skimpy. A lot of broth, but the not as much noodles and toppings.   We also got 3 color dessert (I think it was about $3.99) which was pretty good.   Service was friendly and alright. Food was alright. I think it will be on the rotation for late night eats for us, but daytime there are some options I think that are much better."}
{"text":"Service: Bad  Food:   Goi Cuon - Bad!! There was a hair in it!! Server said it's ok because she showered,  took the hair out and gave us back the same one expecting us to eat it. We said no and still got charged for it still too! !  Egg roll - Ok. The extra crisp was a good touch  Pho - Soup was bland  Pork chop with shrimp and egg - So the server recommended me this dish saying it was the best thing they had. Pork chop was so tough and dry that I couldn't even cut into it!! Adding to that they gave me a butter knife smh Regardless you could tell the pork chop was old and not fresh. Came with some super over cooked grilled shrimp that was super dry as well.   Pickled veggies - Horrible!! It was old. Veggies were all soggy and tasted like band aids.  Gag.    SAVE your money.  Don't eat here. That coming from a Hardcore foodie this is a place to pass."}
{"text":"their broth for pho is lacking..i love how they slice their meats like tendon and fatty brisket.BOMB.their egg rolls are amazing and service sucks now. sorry but you have to step it up"}
{"text":"I take back two stars after the lunch I had there yesterday.  It was terrible.  The chicken in my bun was like shoe leather.  The mango shake tasted spoiled and I think it gave my partner a case of mild food poisoning.  The service was pitiful too.  The only person even remotely civil was the woman at the cash.  And for the love of God, PLEASE do something about the carpet.  It is filthy to the point of being nauseating.  I will not go back to this location"}
{"text":"This probably has to be the prettiest pho restaurant on Spring Mountain. It's cute how they have bed panels (or something that looks like it) as table dividers.  The pho is just okay though. Service was ... okay. I'll forgive them since they look like beginners at waiting.  What really made this pho experience a bit below average was how the amigo was working his behind off cleaning up tables while the waiters were just lounging (and sitting..?) around chit chatting."}
{"text":"Out of many pho options along Spring Mountain Road, this is a good one, particularly because it's open later than most (until 3am) and offers a few Vietnamese beer options (Saigon red - yes!) Very large bowls of hot pho with lots of meat. The meat isn't the best quality - a bit stringy in some places, grisly or fatty in others, but there is plenty of it and enriches the flavor of the broth. You don't need the finest cut of meat for a good bowl of pho, and the broth is rich and the plates of vegetables and herbs that you add-in yourself are fresh and aromatic.  The traditional Hung bowl is a combo beef standard including tripe, liver, flank.  Pho ga is a great chicken-noodle, plenty of chicken.   The spring rolls are huge and fresh, though not the most flavorful. One order gets you four generous pieces.  The menu is expansive and includes not only several types of pho but also extensive non-pho options (rice and meat plates, curry, etc). These can be hit-or-miss, quite honestly - the meat tends to be overcooked or dry at times, but it's all fairly authentic to what one is offered in Vietnam itself. Simple, filling, delicious, and plenty of spices and rice to fill it out. (I like the menu here because it also includes an interesting article on the different food regions of Vietnam).   As for location, this is a spacious and clean area, brightened by fish tanks, plant age and various Southeast Asian gods and decor. Flatscreen TVs broadcast authentic Southeast Asian programming and music which is entertaining and experience-enhancing. It's definitely comfortable enough to spend a leisurely meal if you have the time.   Service can be rather slow. Again, it's a cultural thing.  Overall, I enjoy getting an authentic, full cultural taste and experience with my international fair. Pho Hung does a pretty good job of it, and in that regard I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"Ya, NO!   Pho Hung, wtf? Are you kidding me? Your pho is phoking terrible!  I used to think this place was decent but after lunching there today, I'm not impressed. The pho broth is not good! It tastes exactly like...Campbell's chicken noodle broth. I had to thoroughly douse it with hot sauce to get any flavour out of it.  Pho aside, It's still a decent lunch spot and the only Vietnamese place in the neighbourhood. And at $6 for a small pho I can't complain, I'd eat it again. Just saying...don't visit here in search of great pho."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pho place!!  Close to the U of T campus (right across the street from the ROM)... and great tasting pho for a great price.   The best pho place I've been to in the GTA area, but I hear there are 2 restaurants that are better in the Ossington area. But until I try it there, this place gets voted #1  Good place for lunch, dinner or a snack after studying."}
{"text":"This place gets very busy during food hours.  Reasons probably include the primo location, the cheap food, and the ginormous portions.  I've always been a fan of the pho here but had the frogs legs for the first time today.  Oh lord, try the frog legs, they are delectable!  I'm still full from that extra large pho and frog leg lunch, 9 hours later.    The service is spotty.  Sometimes they are fast, sometimes they ignore you, and sometimes they are downright rude.  I don't know what to make of it.  Sometimes I feel awkward when the staff at Asian restaurants treat you nicely, as if they care about your service.  Not here though, reminds me of home."}
{"text":"I must had really wanted pho when I was in Vegas...well. Duh. I probably had a hangover from partying the night before. But pho is pho...walked in and it was completely empty. The service was OK, but I can only imagine how slow it would be if there were actually people dining in the restaurant. It had parking too!  I got the regular rare steak pho...and eh. It was OK. Not the worst pho I've had, but not the best either. Definitely just...OK."}
{"text":"This place was good but it had an air of being a disappointment. The owner, I think, or the chef made an extra effort to please us. He took the time to show us how to eat the Pho with meatballs. He mixed a small plate of sauces for us and instructed us on the proper way to eat the meatball in the Pho. It was thoughtful. Then I log into my Yelp and I noticed the bad ratings... I think they were trying to make an effort to be a better place to dine. As for the food, the spring rolls where not the fresh spring rolls we are accustom to having. The soups were fine, I like it quite a bit, lots of noodles full of flavor. I liked the people who ran it, they seemed genuine, but unfortunately with so many options in Vegas we will probably be skipping this place in the future. The significant other didn't like it as much as I did and was a little turned off by the aquariums they had."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Pho Hung, I thought it was pretty good.  Over the next four visits, I noticed that the pho just wasn't as good as some other places.  Soup wasn't so flavorful, the tendon was kind of overly mushy, noodles undercooked.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me four times, can't get fooled again. They get points for a clean restaurant with good service and being open late, but given the numerous other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, you might do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Comfortable setting. Friendly staffs.  Good food. I would come back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the secluded location or perhaps the strange after taste of the broth left on your tongue.  Whatever the case be, I really am not a fan of the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious with a karaoke stage to your left upon entering. There's a big \"fruit tree\" located in the middle which is a nice sight. However, the wait time for food is rather long. I went here with a group of 7 and had to wait about 40 minutes for food? Nothing comparable to Pho Kim Long (my go to place for pho).    I'm pretty easily fulfilled with pho from any place, but I was just thrown off by the after taste of the broth as stated above. My final verdict? If you can get pho somewhere else - go for it."}
{"text":"I love this Pho place! The broth they use for their pho is exceptional and their fresh spring rolls are awsome! I keep coming here, and I will continue to keep coming here. I have been to almost every pho place in Las Vegas, and this is definitely top 3! I love this place :)"}
{"text":"Food-great!  (2 visits, about 5-6 different items on the menu) Service-very good/no frill price/portion size-reasonable ambiance-meh (it's a Pho house, whaddya want??!!)  4-star. Delish Viet food at good value.  Just across from the ROM. If you want a romantic setting with hand holding service, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Joe and I were lucky enough to make it in here before they closed, especially because I wanted to try some good Pho in Toronto.  We had spent the afternoon at the Royal Ontario Museum, and once I saw this place was across the street, I knew we had to go.  Located upstairs, there's a nice view of all the goings-on down below.  You have to order yourself -- meaning, the server gives you a piece of paper and a pencil, and you write down how many and what you want.  Joe and I were confused at first and wasted a good 10 minutes before we were told what to do.  Oops.  We shared an order of the Spring rolls, which were actually very tasty, and finished them quickly.  I believe I got one of the Vermicelli dishes (as usual) and it was one of the better Pho meals that I had.  I also went with one of the tropical shakes, but I don't think they had the option to add bubbles.  It's definitely a good place to get your Pho on.  There's also another location (on Spadina) but this one is good if you want some cheap and good eats after getting your culture on at the ROM."}
{"text":"This is the only Pho place I trust in Vegas. Its not the best pho I have ever had but its the best for Vegas standards. Its clean and and comfortable environment, and the stomach appeared to agree with the food so that speaks loudly. Pricing isnt too bad either."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I had 2 bad experiences at this location, all due to their lack of customer service. Like others have said, the waiters were completely ignorant. We asked a waiter to check on our order but he gave us this \"what?\" look and went away. We thought he was still going to check on our order but he never came back. We asked the other waiter to bring us back some change but he never came back with them, assuming that whatever was left from our bill was for tips. I DON'T THINK SO, MISTER! I hate places who expect tips but don't deliver at least decent customer service. Even the greasy Chinese places in Chinatown have better customer service.  I've been going to this place since I was still in U of T (4 years and counting) and I noticed that their quality (both in food and service) has deteriorated SIGNIFICANTLY. And forget about the quality, even the quantity has been reduced significantly as well. $6 for a small mediocre pho is just not worth it. I haven't been back to the Spadina location for awhile now, maybe I should give that one a try again.  Overall, we would NOT be coming back to this place in the future. One of the worst places to eat in downtown Toronto! :("}
{"text":"I used to go to this spot on a somewhat regular occasion. When me and a few of my girlfriends would get to together for our Pho dates we would come here because two of them really liked the place.   I recently went last week because a new friend loves this place and it was nice to be reacquainted. I quickly remembered why never minded coming to this place and I also remembered why I stopped coming.  I got my typical bowl of Pho. The special combo, extra tendon. They slacked on the extra tendon. They were very skimpy with my extra tendon, you never would have thought that I had asked for extra tendon.   But they win almost hands down for their flavor of broth. It was perfect for me. It is intense with its aroma, delicious in its taste and if I had to it plain with no condiments I would and could. But of course, I always add a ton of siricha, fish sauce and sambal.   Where they lose me is the funky tinge of silver, green and purple on their meat. Maybe I am over picky or too sensitive to this. But this is completely unacceptable to me and my standards.   I also ordered their charbroiled pork spring roll and I am not a fan of how they are open on the ends instead of being closed in.   I would come back here again. I just wouldn't order the Pho which is sad for me because I LOVE their broth. Maybe I could order a beef ball Pho instead."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get some Pho. They are never too busy and service is prompt and courteous. I love the fact that they are open till 2am as there have been a few times where my friends and I wanted to find a good place to eat late at night near Chinatown where we wouldn't have to rush or wait on long service. The dining area is very modern looking and is always clean. The huge fish tanks are a nice touch. Never had to wait too long for the food and the prices are not bad."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for the first time, and I am very disappointed. It was a cold, rainy night and pho sounded soo good. The man that greeted me and took care of my to go order was very nice. The vietnamese karaoke was very loud upon entering, but being vietnamese myself... I'm used to this sort of thing. I ordered a pho Tai and two orders of egg rolls to go. I figured the egg rolls had to be bomb because it is very difficult to mess up vietnamese egg rolls. My mistake for assuming... within the first bite I was immediately disappointed. They were burnt, chewey, and had a very distinct funny smell. Maybe they had gone bad already? I had my bf taste them and he was disgusted by them as well. Without a doubt the worst egg rolls I have ever eaten. I ended up throwing away two orders of egg rolls within only taking two bites. The pho was mediocre and tasted like it had an overpowering aroma of cinnamon in it? What the pho?!?!!  After finishing her vietnamese version of American idol, the hostess/owner?/singer gave the Mic to another employee to sing... but as she walked back to her hostess stand and grabbed her bottle of Hennessey and proceeded to drink while giving me a dirty stare. Which made me feel a bit uneasy. I have no problem patronizing a place that enjoys entertainment and the occasional employees getting faded at work, but being a customer... I'd like to be acknowledged by a warm, hospitable, and friendly environment. Just to be fair, maybe her Hennessey was hitting her just a little too much. I will not be returning, and I strongly advise everyone to spend their hard earned money elsewhere."}
