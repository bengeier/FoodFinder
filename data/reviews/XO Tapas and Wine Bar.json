{"text":"If you are truly looking for great food, this is definitely the best restaurant within a 250 mile radius, NO QUESTION!  Great restaurant for both 'foodies' and newcomers looking for an amazing food experience.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is surprising for it's locale, it has a very urban feel for a suburban setting.  However, price is very affordable for the quality of food served, each tapas dish ranges from $6-$12, with most being ~$8.   The wine selection is exceptional, with a must-have being the Sangria.  We went with a large party and tried almost the entire menu, of which my favorite dishes were the steak, halibut, and fried shrimp.  Another 'must-have' is the \"caprese salad\".  To top it off with dessert, I recommend the liquid nitrogen-spun ice-cream."}
{"text":"I live close to this place. I've driven by it a hundred times yet never went inside. After going to happy hour at XO Tapas and Wine Bar I will definitely have to go back again. The ambiance was chic, very upscale. There is something for everyone, flat screen TVs a cozy corner filed with chairs and couches, a upper and lower level. The happy hour specials were great. The staff was pleasant. The food was delicious. I just wish people would come out to this place. It was nearly empty. Other than that I had a blast."}
{"text":"I'll be coming back to this place and I live over 6 hours away!  Between the food, service, and atmosphere, this was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Executive chef, Kyle Schutte has created an excellent menu.  The sangria was recommended by our server. It was delicious. Not too sweet, but perfectly light fruity and refreshing.  We sampled practically the entire menu. Among my favorites were the caprise salad. A very elegant and clever amuse-bouche like dish.  The hanger steak, so tasty and full of flavor.  This may be my new favorite cut of meat (a generous portion too!). The halibut over risotto, And the calamari. Perfectly fried, nice and tender. The pink lemonade mayo pairs great too.  Make sure to leave room for dessert!  Our party ordered 3 and they were all amazing. My favorites were the white chocolate palenta and the nitrogen spun home made mint ice cream. It was served with a chocolate chip cookie.  A great end too a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Love the place. The tapas are excellent. The hostess and wait staff are very professional and the girls good looking. Robert, the general manager is a pretty good guy too. He needs to have more cheap Stella nights. I always take my visitors from London and other places to the XO. It is a uptown place that you might find in uptown Charlotte and definately fulfills the need for a cool place on the lake. I would give XO a fifth star, but I am a hard grader. Besides, if they think they are too good, they might raise prices.   Larry S."}
{"text":"This bar is a little to uppity for me. They had an awesome band playing, Burning Bright, which was the only reason I went. It wasn't too crowded and the bartenders and waiters were nice on the eyes. They had pretty good beer specials too. Would probably take my lawyer friend there. His type of crowd.  FYI... XO closed.  Don't now when/if it will be open again."}
