{"text":"Best price in town. When you can't decide where to eat, this place has it all. The Greek Pork chops are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I got the eggs and hash browns I ordered 5 minutes after I ordered them but they were cold, as if they were made 10 minutes before I got there. The corned beef hash was microwaved and cold in the middle."}
{"text":"My family has been going there all my life and i'm currently 19. The best place for any meal and great for the family. Lolipops for the little kids at the register if they're good."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend for breakfast. For as busy as they get the service is fast, the waitresses are awesome, and the food is always on point. I have nothing but good things to say about Georges. We love this place, we love the people, and we love the food."}
{"text":"George's has fast service, is reasonably priced and has tasty food. My family has been going for years! It's always great to see George there himself too."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on yelp reviews and was not disappointed.   Good food and value.   Service was top notch.  We are just visiting Cleveland and definitely stop here when visiting again!"}
{"text":"There is no other Diner I eat at when I'm Cleveland. They make you feel right at home...Renee my Server is the Best! Keep you laughing and she's on top of her game! George is the Man!"}
{"text":"Large portions of cheap food for a very reasonable price.  

The food is cheap GFS frozen garbage, the hash browns and fries are never salted, and the eggs/omelettes are always brown.  That being said, it isn't terrible food.

Don't expect much, it is a classic greasy spoon.  It is better than fast food, and it is convenient, which is why I eat here.  The waitresses are friendly, the service is very fast, and George is a greek version of Don Vito.  Listen to the waitress drama, it will make you laugh."}
{"text":"I read a recent review by another helper about George's not having any specialty items.  They have moussaka for pete's sake! They also have something crazy called a garbage plate burger, I don't eat burgers, but it looked interesting with lots of items smothering the whole plate.  It's the perfect place to go for hangover brunch."}
{"text":"Exceptional home cooking at blue collar pricing. Amazing pork chops and spaghetti with meatballs. Tried the spicey burger with ghost pepper cheese. Double patty for $6.95. Very good! Friendly and courteous staff. Neighborhood institution."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years, always fast service, HOT food and have yet to have a bad meal. Great menu, with everything a diner should have and more. If you stop for breakfast you to have the corned beef hash, prob the best in Cleveland. If you like great hot food that is priced right this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"Horrific dining experience. This is the first time I've left a place without ordering food, and the first time I've had to call the Health Inspector's Office to request they do a walkthrough.

We were sat, and ordered water and coffee while we looked over the menu. I went to put sugar in my coffee using the shaker on the table. Only a small amount of sugar came out. I realized it was all clumped together, so I unscrewed the top to break it up with my knife. There was HAIR inside the sugar shaker. Not one mind you. Not an eyelash that accidentally slipped in. Multiple hairs. I almost gagged (especially since I'd already taken a sip of coffee). 

Then we noticed that both of our water glasses were filthy. There was some kind of leafy green INSIDE our glasses, covered in the water we'd also been drinking. My girlfriend also appeared to have a pop or coffee stain on hers, that would have been obvious to any server.

We decided at this point that three ruined drinks were not a coincidence, and were indicative of the food we'd get there. We were too sick to our stomachs to feel comfortable ordering. So I left $2 for the coffee and we went down the street to Diana's on 117th. 

Terrible. I don't know where this cult following comes from, but I strongly suggest you avoid George's."}
{"text":"Just happened across George's while looking for another breakfast place.  Although the parking lot was packed, I was seated immediately and had coffee very quickly.  The food was served quicker than I've seen at TacoBell or McDonalds!  Good preparation, very good taste, and portions that are manageable.  Cheese omelet, bacon, home fries, toast, coffee, and excellent home-made rice pudding for $10 !

George's is at the corner of Triskett and Berea Rd.  I'll be back again with my wife (and friends).  The daily specials on the menu look very promising, too.  Wednesday shows Short Ribs and Lamb Shank.  Sunday has Turkey, and Prime Rib (among other things).  Menu has extensive choices, only lacking grits :={{{  .  

Dianna's, on W. 117th, comes close to George's in style and menu, but I'd drive the extra mile or two to George's."}
{"text":"I like the fast service and the price. 
Food is good but not too crazy about the place. Some parts were dirty with dust. When I was there water was leaking down from the ceiling right above where they prep the salad and toast. 
I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Breakfast- This is true fast food!!! By the time you drink two sips of your coffee ...BAM....your food is at your table. The meals always taste homecooked and CHEAP!"}
{"text":"I've only been to George's twice but my boyfriend and I both dream about their pancakes! They are the most delicious pancakes both of us have ever had! He has also ordered an omelet which he liked and I ordered their eggs and hashbrowns. Eggs were fine and the hashbrowns were also amazing!! Cheap prices too! But don't go too late in the morning on a Sunday cuz you'll have a bit of a wait. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been a patron for over 15 years of George's and must say the food is always good, service great, & prices unbelievable. Yes it's a \"hole in the wall\" type diner but never disappoints."}
{"text":"I give the actual place 3 stars and the food 4 stars.    The inside of the diner atmosphere is quite down at heel and could use a little sprucing.   The carpet needs a good steam cleaning  and the tables (at least the one where we were sitting) need refinishing.  That said, I WILL be going back.  This is one of those places that you say \"You know, I ought to go there....\" and you forget.  Well, my best friend (who is UBER picky about eating out) and her younger 2 kids love this place, so the boyfriend and I went this weekend.   At 7 at night this place was jumping, some thing I haven't seen in a while due to the economy.   

We were seated right away and as a warning they only have booths, so that is usually a big NO for me as I am of generous proportions.  I fit with room, so bonus on that.  We were given water, menus and then were blessedly left alone to actually READ the menu BEFORE being asked what we wanted to drink  (One of my pet peeves is being asked that BEFORE I EVEN HAVE ASS TO SEAT!)  Large menu and extremely affordable.   I dozen mozz  sticks for $4.75. Yes, one dozen!  They were hot, crispy and promptly served.   I had the 8 oz. buffalo chicken sandwich and the boyfriend and the cornbeef and cabbage.   Both meals came with soup or salad and mine with fries.  Not too happy with the salad as it was smothered in onions (I hate onions) and it came out of  a cooler right by our table, which to me should be behind the counter or in the kitchen.   That bothered me a little .  Boyfriend loved his dinner and so did I.  My kaiser roll was so fresh, I would have thought they baked it that minute.  Tip: cut the chicken in half and double decker your sammy.  Too big for the bun!

Our server was prompt, efficient and what I expect in a diner.  

Really good food, really good price. 

Will go again!"}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland icon!!  Great place to come and kill the morning shakes before bloody Mary's. Rock on!!"}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem in Cleveland. Its a down-to-Earth diner with super cheap prices, great service and even better food!

Two meals, drinks, and an appetizer for $17? Yes please. And the portions were giant!

I recommend this for anyone looking for some great \"home\" style cooking on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Good food-fast service- affordable prices-love this place-been coming here since i was a kid with my family-its a great place for breakfast-the food is always good!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great waitress. Just a lil wait. But we'll worth it.


Ok we went back to George's cause of the great food. well this time we got an older waitress and she went to hand us out food and spilled his pop on the table and him got all that cleaned up she goes to give me my food and spilled the juices from that on me. we left not sure if we will be going back. not good."}
{"text":"The food for the price is good. They give larger portions at an appropriate price. This place is always busy. It is a hidden gem in Cleveland that is worth it. The only downside to the place is the service, mostly the wait staff. I live by here and go here a few times a year and every time the wait staff is an issue. Some of them act as if you are a bother to be there, some of the older ones take forever with everything and you never see them when you need something but there are a few good ones. For the price and food, I can accept the poor wait staff. 

I think the best part of George's Kitchen is their breakfasts! I recommend this place for a fast cheap bite to eat."}
{"text":"Visiting George's while in town is becoming a tradition. I've enjoyed everything on the menu. They even have some \"American\" dishes with a Greek spin on it, like the fried pork chops. The biggest surprise for me every time is how inexpensive all this great food is."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it still tastes just as amazing as it did when I was little. Definitely one of those childhood memory places for me. Prices are pretty cheap. Only downfall is its usually always packed, but the food and prices are worth it imo. The chicken Alfredo with broccoli is soooOoooo good. The waiters are also really friendly. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Not sure where everyone else's food standards are when they're here but I thought my side salad was old, soggy and floppy, entree was tasteless and dry (Had chicken sandwich) and the coke was flat...The server never came back to fill up our drinks or ask us how the food was. If she had, i would have asked for a new salad and a different sandwich. Will never be back here, sadly."}
{"text":"This is a great diner. Always busy and great food at a reasonable price. This special place is a real favorite of mine and fabulous for people watching."}
{"text":"I am shamed. This is the Platonic Form of Diner, and my first visit is sinfully today. Chicken soup screams Diner. Bar stools at lunch counter scream Diner. Waitress with thick European accent of indeterminate origin screams Diner. Perch from Lake Erie screams Diner. Mom and I gorged ourselves for $15, also, of Diner.  You could lift this joint by helicopter and drop it in Manhattan tomorrow, all of NYC would praise the Diner Gods on bended knee without ceasing.

And you, YOU who have kept this place your secret Diner Nirvana, who are you people? You are sinners against all that is Diner, in league with scribes and pharisees. All that is good and holy and of Diner, you speak of it not, lest your fellow diners seek nourishment from the font of Diner. Repent!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Great food, great prices, great, homey atmosphere, and great servers. What more could you possibly want?"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting the parking lot to be  almost full when visiting about noon, but my initial impression was good! The building itself is a little dated but clean and the staff is very friendly. 

I had the gyro omelet with toast and home fries and was very satisfied after.  My fiance had the meatloaf and chose fries and vegetable soup and it came with some Italian bread. Everything looked and tasted like it was made from scratch (from what  I was able to taste). 

I typically enjoy the diner atmosphere more than the typical corporate restaurant and George's did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"24 hr kick ass diner! you can't beat this place for breakfast! plus the waitress are movers! and they don't screw around. 

hit it up no matter the time, you'll be happy! french toast is pretty good for using regular white bread, no texas toast but oh well. 

everything is amazingly cheap! but great quality.

peace"}
{"text":"Lived in Cleveland 6 years. Many good places to eat. George's is my new go to. I had the Sloppy Plate Two burger patties with cheese on top os crispy fries smothered in chilli add grilled onions and peopers OMG it was greasy greatness. Boyfriend had burger and fries , friend got scrod with rice baby had a hot dog. We all absolutely enjoyed are meals. Good service, Good dinner food,Nice atmosphere,SUPER CHEAP. CAN'T WAIT TO TRY MORE."}
{"text":"We found George's Kitchen via Yelp while driving West on I-90. This place is amazing. I had the pulled pork sandwich. My daughter had a hamburger and fries  Delicious!  Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"My dad lives in Cleveland every time we go to Cleveland we go to George's. The food is great the prices are out of this world and every time I'm there I see the same staff, George is always there in his corner booth, when it gets busy George will bring drinks and pour coffee, I try to order different things on the menu every time, my favorite are the Greek pork chops with lemon sauce and I don't even like lemons, it's not the fanciest place in the world but the food is awesome and the prices are dirt cheap, and you will see all walks of life, from a basketball player driving a Maserati to a construction worker to a group of college kids."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Cleveland. Their menu has a great selection of different foods. The jumbo shrimp dinner comes with a side, cole slaw, soup & bread all for a little over $7. Home style cooking breakfast, lunch & dinner. I enjoy the walleye fish dinner too! There isn't anything my family members have tried that they didn't like. Lowest prices in town! Easy pickup to go and super fast service if eating in."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my new favorite places in cleveland!  I was a little worried at first, but this place proved me wrong. service was quick, my friends and I had a fabulous waitress named Jen and when we go back we will be requesting her. She made great recommendations since it was our first time there and she was all around just a great waitress! I ordered the turkey deluxe club with fries and cole slaw and chicken noodle soup. Everything was just so fresh and way better than anything you would get at a chain restaurant. For dressed I had apple pie and that was also homemade, Jen even warmed it up for us and added their homemade whipped cream! All of my friends loved what they ordered: steak, ribs, roasted chicken dinner and desserts. 

Prices are completely reasonable! It's like they are practically giving food away. 

One of the reviews talked about the decor and how it needed updating... who cares when the food is that good! 

Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Love ! Love ! Love this place !!!! Any time of the day I can get breakfast I get the same stuff sunny side eggs , hash brown and steak with aide of toast . I been here many times and never had a problem . Every time I have friends or family's in town this is the place I take them for breakfast and they love it !!! Great place fast with the food and great kind people here too"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, there are daily specials and A lot of menu items. I've gone here for a long time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This kitchen is bitchin! The service is fast, the food is greasy, and you, friend, will leave bloated and satisfied! It is by no means going to earn a Michelin star anytime soon, but who cares? They serve mainly comfort food, but their menu is quite extensive. The portions are quite generous, so make sure you wear your fat pants!"}
{"text":"Three for breakfast, $27, wicked fast service, friendly staff, great coffee, killer hash!"}
{"text":"Just passing through on I-90, we decided to pull-off and avoid the chain and fast food places.
Huge variety on menu. Great food, great service, and great prices.  The interior is a bit worn, but you just can't beat this place for anything close to their low prices."}
{"text":"I love George's. My fiancé and I are frequent patrons. George's offers family style comfort and TOP NOTCH people watching for those lazy weekend mornings. I get the chicken and waffles EVERY TIME, and I love them. Their coffee makes me a little twitchy, but it's not bad by diner standards. I wouldn't recommend drinking more than 2.5 cups, unless you are ok with smashing in someone's face out of sheer caffeinated rage later in the day. The music selection is pretty much always oldies, and always awesome. Christmas music 24/7 before Thanksgiving. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I really have no complaints about this really cute, big, family diner (yes, a real DINER in Cleveland!) in the West Park neighborhood. Service, as mentioned in other reviews, is lightning fast. Like, I didn't know you could cook an omelette that quickly! Let alone make it taste delicious. 

The corned beef hash is made in-house and is really great; it actually tastes like corned beef as opposed to overly salty potatoes. A real treat.

The waitresses were really nice and charming. It seems like this place has its fair share of \"regulars\" but the people who work here offer up a smile and friendly conversation to just about anybody who walks through the door.

The staff was also amazing at service and at never being idle. If they weren't waiting on tables, they were slicing bread, pouring dressing into individual cups for salads, and other little tasks that makes the rest of the day go smoother because they can just reach into the fridge and pull stuff out. Smart.

We could have been out in 20 minutes if we had been in a hurry, but we weren't. Despite the quick turnover of tables, we never felt rushed, and we were able to enjoy a leisurely meal.

The place is a little raggedy, but it's obvious that nobody should really care about the way it looks so long as the food is good, cheap, and quick, and the service is great. And George's has all those qualities. Highly recommend for anyone who cares more about food and consistency than about what's popular and overpriced in the nearby areas."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, nice atmosphere.   Whenever I can't decide what or where to have dinner, I know I can find something on the menu at George's that will cause a minimal dent in my wallet.  My parents brought me here and I still come here today.  Even their takeout service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Oh George's Kitchen how I love thee!

This is by far my absolute favorite greasy spoon diner in Cleveland! I appreciate all the staff for the hard work they put in on a daily basis here. Tip them well they work hard and are super friendly! 

Nothing here is done electronically except for the ability to swipe credit cards. Orders are written on receipts and read aloud to the kitchen staff. I have never had a wrong order appear at my table. They make all kinds of substituions for people and they also do take-out orders. I can't even begin to fathom how the kitchen staff handles all the orders but man I am impressed!!

The food never wavers! I have ordered both breakfast and lunch items and I really want to try all the menu items. You can order 3 extra large eggs, hash browns, bacon or sausage and toast for $5!! Most lunch and dinner items are served with your choice of potato and soup and almost everything is under $9!! On my most recent visit I got a Deluxe Turkey Club sandwich and fries for $6! 

Thank you George's for being amazing at what you do!!"}
{"text":"Eh..... It seems as if either I'm a complete snob in all my reviews ... Or I'm hard to please. Lol
Maybe I got the wrong thing today or this is just one of those places that you have to grow up on? 
Either way, the food came out fast... Was cooked perfect, but just was underwhelming. 
I got the country fried steak n eggs plus pancakes. My daughter we got the biscuits n gravy--- was way too peppery and we sent it back. 
Our friend got the beef short ribs and was happy...... 
Nice waitress and quick. Although upon receiving our order there was a long hair attached to one of the plates. In felt it and then found it thank goodness. 
When we were leaving I had a chance to watch the cooks in the kitchen. It's interesting bcuz the servers just call out the orders over a mic--- and they are working hard at pumping out the food. However--- nay a ONE had on gloves.... Reaching into the prep tables and cooking it up, bare handed. That's just plain nasty. 
Come on George!!!!  
So to sum things up. Good food. Good prices.... But let's hope and pray those boys in the back are keeping themselves clean.    Ewe."}
{"text":"I've had takeout from here a few times. The things I've tried have been delicious! George's seems like a great place."}
{"text":"Every neighborhood should have a place like this; it is an old school, unpretentious, family diner serving up great grub, huge portions, and friendly service.  The omelettes are huge, the coffee is always refilled, and the prices are great.  This place is a well-worn and well-liked diner where everyone seems to enjoy the food and each other's company."}
{"text":"This is a great greasy spoon.  The bacon and potatoes were cooked perfectly.  I mean that.  They actually looked like they could be in a picture on a menu.  The prices were good.  Excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"They deserve five stars for breakfast. I had to take away a star for cleanliness, decor, lunch and dinner items and rock hard waffles. 

By far, the best county fried steak. Cooking eggs just right is a science, and they definitely have it down here. The chicken noodle soup and the hot cocoa with whipped cream are exceptional, please try.

Service is a hit or miss. Extremely busy on Saturday and Sunday morning, but they will have you in and out fairly quick. 

Best cheap breakfast in town. Why can't they do some remodeling and clean the place up? That aspect baffles me, I wish they would work on that."}
{"text":"Oh my...two huge pieces of walleye, baked potato, chicken noodle soup, bread, and coleslaw....in Cleveland that will set you back about 7.50 at Georges. Just fantastic..."}
{"text":"For the price, this place may be the best breakfast spot in Cleveland.  Quick service, always a table available, friendly servers and rock-solid breakfast fare (only meal I've ever been there for, but they serve plenty of other dishes as well).

My go-to meal here is the corned beef hash with three sunny-side eggs on top, crispy home fries and toast.  Add a cup of coffee and you are still around $6 for more food than you can probably eat.  how do they do it?

Their meals are fresh, hot and tasty...and the coffee keeps on flowing as long as you'd like.  What more could you want from a diner?  Oh yeah...the cashier gave my daughter a lollipop on the way out.  so there you go!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Georges kitchen my whole life, its a great I'm hungry and I want to eat good food fast and cheap place to a T. One of the only restaurants that two people can eat full meals for well under $20.
My only complaint is that they are not opened 24hrs, but the owners are there from open to close every day and make enough $$ so I see why they are not."}
{"text":"George's kitchen is cheap and delicious, so I'm definitely a fan. You may sit where ever you'd like in here and the waitresses are always very sweet and accommodating. The food always comes out fast and it's just a really nice place to pop into when you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past three years. George's Kitchen has always been excellent, menu, price, and service (which is a little rough...but menu and price is so good...) going there Saturday evening with out of town family. I am certain that no one will be disappointed.

{"text":"Okay, so I read all of the reviews and thought, wow this must be the end all be all.  So off we went for breakfast.  So we go in and are seated right away.  Before getting to the table though, we are lead into the intersection where the busboy and two waitresses try to run us down.  Not intentionally I am sure, but there was nothing polite about the pushing and shoving to get us out of their way.  So not feeling the love.

The place is a bit outdated, but that is okay.  we asked to sit by the window, so we ended up in the back with no window.  Apparently we were not allowed to sit in any of the several available window tables. Must be my good looks.  So at this point, 1 star is looking like a stretch.

Next, we get a waitress that is apparently busy and has the interpersonal skills of a lump of coal.  All though I am sure she had been run ragged.  Did not look like they had enough staff, so can give her a pass.  So really at this point, I want to just make a comment and get out.  The better half calms me down.  So we place our order and play catsup trivial pursuit, thank you Heinz.   So reading the other reviews, we are expecting the food to come flying out.  20 minutes later and a very empty and lonely cup of coffee later, the food arrives.  I am thinking there is no way this is going to be worth all of this hassle.  

I my fellow yelpers was incorrect.  The Corned beef hash is in my top 10 list.  For those that think that is not impressive, I just moved here from RI and New England (that is all of those tiny little states up there) take their hash seriously.  So this is to say, it is really good.  The pancakes were wicked good (see proves I lived in NE).  And the biscuits and gravy were really good as well.  Only gripe on the food is that the biscuits are frozen.  I have not been to a place in Ohio that actually makes their biscuits.  If there is a place, I would love for someone to tell me.  

Anyway, this place was able to salvage it's self somewhat.  So if you can put up with the service, the food is worth the wait.  Next time we will try the non breakfast stuff."}
{"text":"Went at 9:30am on Sunday and the place was packed. Michelle was our server and she was attentive and took our orders. Food arrived and was tasty. I had scrambled eggs and sausage links but we were a party of 6 and ordered a variety of foods and everyone joined the clean plate club. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Ive known of this place for a very long time, however I have only actually started going recently. There's a good reason why this place has been around all through my childhood. I'd say it's because it's pretty good food at a good price with a friendly and attentive staff.

While it's not a high end place with fancy food, it gets the job done if you want something good for a solid restaurant price. You get a good amount of food for the price you pay. You won't leave feeling hungry, that's for sure.

As for the menu, George's has a huge variety to pick from and you're more than likely able to find something to suit your taste no matter what your lifestyle or food preference may be. 

My favorite meal so far has either been the lasagna or the chicken parmesan. Also, the chicken noodle soup is always the best choice for soup; Best I've had at a restaurant. George's Kitchen is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"George's kitchen is the best! Great food for a great price and very welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing & work very hard. Food is always delicious & very reasonably priced! Love coming here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We are regulars there. Food is very affordable so much so that I go 2 or 3 times a week with the family. Great food as Well. Pancakes are delicious. My wife says they taste like funnel cakes and I have to agree."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Decor is massively outdated, but I don't care. The food was amazing, service awesome, and prices so inexpensive. My family of 5 ate full meals (steak/potatoes/soup/salad/bread , lasagna/soup/salad/bread, turkey/dressing/potatoes/green beans/soup/salad/bread, Eggs/toast/hashbrowns, stir fry/soup/salad/bread) for $37 (menu price, no discounts), and It was on Easter! All the food tasted great, even our well done T-bone was fully cooked, and still juicy! They can absolutely keep the 1980's decor, and the 1980's prices too!

We stopped on the way home (MI) from our visit to NY. First time diners!"}
{"text":"Old fashioned diner. It is always crowded so we had to stop and check this place out. For being packed the service was fast and friendly! This place is a bargain for the amount of food you get!!"}
{"text":"Great prices with a lot of food!  Home style food with large portions.  Love the Lake Erie Perch which is sweet and gently fried.  Mousakka is delicious made with Eggplant a Geek delight!  George is always there to welcome his guest.  Always busy but service is great.  Very popular on the west side!"}
{"text":"It is a slow mid-morning on Wednesday at George's. The waitress was very nice in helping me in the pre-coffee reading of the menu. The eggs, bacon, pancakes & coffee tasted great. A good start to another day on the road!"}

{"text":"I've been coming to George's kitchen since I was a little kid. The food is great and the prices can't be beat.  
  They are even old school where they bring you out a glass of water when you sit down."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  I wish it were a lot closer!  The service was very attentive and helpful, and the food was hot, fresh, and delicious (walleye for me, a steak for the husband, and spaghetti for the kiddo). Also, the prices are the most reasonable I've seen on a restaurant menu in a LONG time.  The menu is extremely extensive; you could order something different every night and never get bored. (Well, I could!)

Our server was so good.  She made great recommendations, and she made sure that another server helped us after her double shift ended.

George's Kitchen comes with our highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Good food, very cheap price wise and the counter lady was super awesome, everything was correct even our modifications. Great Walleye."}
{"text":"As a redneck, I like to consider myself as a lover of good diners. 

Ok.  Im a chubby redneck who just got out the Marines and enjoys food 

This place was great.  It was super packed and for a really good reason.
 The waitress was wonderful. Keeping up with the high flow perfectly.  I had the lasagna and it was wonderful. Soft noodles filled with great tasting meats.  The sauce was thick and full of flavor. The soup was chicken and noodle.  It was thick. Great noodles. And delicious chicken. 
The food was great for a diner.  Not only up to par, but setting a great standard for home cookin' diners. 

The only downfall 
The parking spots were small for my truck."}

Service is above average with most servers are experienced 
Pricing very reasonable."}

{"text":"Good family style restaurant which is a great place when you're really hungry but don't want to spend a fortune.  Good Cuban sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap simple meal. A favorite of mine for a classic, no frills breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow, good, inexpensive fare with good prices and an old, homey atmosphere?

George's (and I'm a bit biased by the name,) is a great little family restaurant off of Triskett that has a TON of great meals and great prices. There's lot parking with plenty of spots, and the staff are good folks who are thoughtful and very helpful in my experience. 
BTW, the breakfast choice are TASTY AND GOOD SIZED, and are totally worth it...

So, head over to George's for a breakfast (or lunch, or dinner,) treat, and tell them...well, you-know-who sent you:)"}

Being from the Mississippi Gulf Coast, I wanted to try some good lake fish. The walleye was phenomenal, and the portions unbelievably large! My wife got the crab balls with fettuccine and it rivaled anything we've ever had in New Orleans! Except that the portion was huge and about 1/3 the cost!!
Seriously, eating here is cheaper than making it at home! Two thumbs way up!!!

Went back to George's for breakfast when we visited my daughter for Thanksgiving! Fantastic!! Man if I lived in the area, I'd be at this place all the time!!!"}
{"text":"The best diner in Cleveland by far. I've had a lot of Cuban sandwiches and this was one of the best I've had which was completely surprising, plus it came with fries and cost $5.25. The prices don't even seem possible they are so low. Also tried corned beef omelet, sausage gravy, chicken fried steak, and a pancake. All items legit - whole check was $24! I can't believe I've been here for 2 years and never come here. I will be a regular now."}
{"text":"Once a month at least.  Omelette and coffee.  Never had a bad breakfast...even at 3pm.  Smiling faces abound on servers and customers"}
{"text":"I had been wanting a tuna melt. That can be a difficult one to master for some places. Too much mayo or sandwich spread, didn't drain it well enough so it's runny, or they add things that aren't desirable like large rather than small onion bits and celery. I figured that George's always has a pretty full lot and who doesn't love a good diner? I really enjoyed the tuna melt. It met the criteria that I would have it again and it didn't run all over my hands as I ate it or soak through the rye bread. My boyfriend got their meatloaf with potatoes and gravy and was also well-satisfied with the quality as well as portion size. Our server kept our drinks full, checked on us and was attentive and friendly. We'll definitely be back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I admit, without the positive reviews from Yelp/Yelpers, I would not have eaten lunch at George's Kitchen. It's not your foodie/organic/hipster place. This is a super simple, unpretentious, down-home establishment. You are welcomed when you walk in the door and graciously thanked on your way out. Yeah, some seats are ripped and tables chipped and stains here and there....but it's okay, trust me. 

I felt good about spending my money here - I like that feeling. I ordered the gyro and it was excellent. It came with a bowl of homemade chicken noodle soup...which I almost declined, but thought better of it because I had a feeling it would be homemade. The chicken noodle soup was indeed homemade and perfect. My dining partners ordered spaghetti and meatballs, potato pancakes and french fries --- all of which were fine. Nothing to write home about, but definitely quality diner fare at a way reasonable price.

I like George's Kitchen. It's just a good place with good people."}
{"text":"Fastest and best breakfast in town. Great service, family atmosphere, and their corned beef hash is to die for. It's almost impossible to not order a small stack of their pancakes once you see someone else receive a plate of them. Same owners and waitresses for years. Can't beat consistency"}
{"text":"Solid food. Solid no-frills but friendly service. Fast. Cheap.

Nowhere else are you going to get an 8oz sirloin steak with potato (baked, fries, homefries, mashed), soup, salad, bread and butter for a price that won't give you food poisoning. In 5 minutes flat. 

The first time I came here, I was shocked at how fast my food came. I think the next time I came, I literally timed it with my phone from the second I finished ordering to the time I got my food. If I recall, it was 2 minutes and 21 seconds to get the soup and salad. Everything else arrived in the next 3 minutes. It's like...they can read my mind and know what I want!

I could die happy drinking their chicken noodle soup. It is that good."}
{"text":"This is a great ,old fashioned neighborhood restaurant in the Westpark neighborhood of Cleveland. Most of us grew up being brought here by our grandparents! Great breakfast, fast and easy on the wallet. Very affordable sit down meals. They don't update interior much, like ever. Every now and then you'll get a waitress that will rush you too much but not always. We always return and the past few times have been great. Fast ,easy and down to earth."}
{"text":"A Cleveland institution.  Best place and diner to get breakfast anywhere in the city in my opinion (though Diner on Clifton is a close 2nd). 

But honestly all of their food is great.  Has that home-cooked, comfort food feel which makes you feel like you're at your grandma's kitchen.  It is always busy but you rarely wait too long for a table.  With your food coming out just as fast, without quality taking a back burner.

The only reason I really ever gert breakfast anywhere else is just to try something new, as I know George's will never disappoint."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, warm \"family\" atmosphere, huge portions of delicious comfort food. The Moussaka (I hope I'm spelling that correctly!) is my absolute favorite. Their breakfast is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Cheap tastey and home cooked. Favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Found this gem after a few that an aquaintance had recommended were all closed. Very friendly wait staff, very good home cooked meals. Turkey was the special that day and it was terrific.  Sister in law had the Spare ribs on sauerkraut and said it was the way her Mom used to make! Wife had Mousaka and was very good. Visit this place! If you haven't you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever!!! I grew up on Georges in Cleveland and missed it while i was living in columbus for 5 years. My mouth was watering driving back from Columbus just thinking about those pancakes. Great family owned restaurant, quick service, and a sucker on the way out! woo woo!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place. It has food for anybody. There are tons of food items to choose from and they're willing to accommodate my pickiness. The food always comes out hot and fast. I have been going here for years!"}
{"text":"George's is your typical diner. Open since 1980 - it's quickly approaching Cleveland Legend status.   Nothing fancy; eight pages of menu items; quick service;  and the owner watching it all.

The servers are all running.  All the time.   No one rests.  If they arent schleping trays to tables, they are making salads;  refilling coffee; doling out bowls of soup; or waiting at the window for food.

Food is standard diner fare.  It's cheap; plentiful and nearly always comes with soup and salad;  bread and butter.

Even with all the tables full, the food gets to thr table fast.

If you are a foodie that wants non gmo locally sourced veggies or free range no antibiotic sung to sleep nightly chickens - save your rage.   Skip Georges.

If you want a greasy bacon cheeseburger, walleye dinner, or a kick butt breakfast - become a regular. 

And say Hi to George.  His face is on the menu; he's in the first booth and will carry a coffee pot when its busy."}
{"text":"I dropped a hot dog on the floor when i was a kid and it hit the wall next to me, it smeared mustard and ketchup on the wall.. the mustard stain is still there. I'm 30."}
{"text":"Sunday morning. 9:14AM. I rolled out of bed just thirty minutes prior with a taste for my usual here at George's; three eggs, scrambled, homefries. four pieces of bacon, rye toast. We open the door to the unassuming diner and walk in, greeted by George himself. He points to the corner, and speaks \"Anywhere you'd like\" as he watches everything at once. The wife ordered a ham and mushroom omelet with cheese and extra cheese and the boy got himself a short stack and sausages.

Sunday morning. 9:39AM. I walked out of George's with a full belly. Tax, and generous tip later, I still don't think I could have had a better breakfast for twice the price."}
{"text":"Great little diner. I was amazed by the amount of food you get for the price and it always has that home cooked taste."}
{"text":"Always good. Always cheap and they have daily specials. The Greek pork chops with a fantastic lemon sauce hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great place n people, but the food didn't have flavor. I'll try it out again sometime but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"When we got here, it wasn't really clear what the procedure was for seating.  There was a huge line, and it seemed a little like a free-for-all.  We settled in, expecting a pretty serious wait, but ended up getting seated in less than 10 min.  Looking around, the food at all the tables looked really good and the portions were very generous.  The server was really nice and got us our drinks and took our orders quickly.  The food came fast and tasted great.  Pancakes tasty, eggs cooked just right, crispy hash browns, and some pretty decent corned beef hash. 

The only thing keeping this review from a 5-star is the fact that the place was run-down and could use a little clean-up. That's it. 

All in all a great experience.  Two of us, in and out in less than 40 minutes, for $22 (including tip).  Worth another visit for sure."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast (and hangovers)! Food is super cheap, comes quick and fresh, and all the employees are very friendly. All of the breakfast food is great, I'm also a fan of their burgers, and their homemade chili is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Chicken noodle soup is delicious. I got the soup, steak, eggs, hash browns, toast, and coffee for 9.50. Not only is it affordable, but the location it great for me, always get seated quickly, and the food is great. Couldn't ask for more out of a diner."}
{"text":"Excellent. Food was delicious, portions were huge, and the service was great. I will definitely be frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"We were here at about 9:00 on St. Patricks day hoping to get a quick breakfast in before the boozers showed up to line their stomachs. When we got there it was just starting to get a little busy. The servers were all super nice. We walked in with our 6 month old son in hand and within a minute I had 3 different girls ask we wanted a high chair. Not only is the service here good and fast but the food was fantastic! The prices are good and the portions are big. I'm typically not a fan of homefries cause at most places they are insanely bland. The homefries here were great! You can tell they use quality eggs and not the cheapest things they can buy. They say jumbo eggs on the menu and they aren't lying, I had 3 jumbo eggs, bacon, homefries and toast for under $5.00 and I was stuffed when I left there.

We like to check out new breakfast spots every Sunday and don't repeat our stops to often but we'll be back here at some point for sure. 

Well done George!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat in the city. Usually you'll catch me here on a Sunday for breakfast/brunch. It's always packed. Staff is extremely friendly. They are fast and the food comes out fast. Food is delicious. It's diner/comfort food. Never had a bad meal here. I really am into their burgers. Just a simple cheeseburger and fries (My mouth is watering just thinking about it)Taste like a diner burger. I have always been a big fan of diner foods. 
Make sure you tips those ladies well. They are working hard and always friendly. 
It's decorated kinda like a old lady lives there but I'm into it. It makes the place. I don't need a fancy place to eat. Just good food and service.

If you're into diner/comfort foods make sure you hit up George's. You won't have a bad meal. If you see me there on Sunday say hello :)  

To all the haters of George's, you guys are cray cray!!"}
{"text":"I been coming here since before 1980. Awesome American food family restaurant. and awesome price. It's packed all the time. My foreign  wife will not eat American food except At George's. Im so grateful for what George his  daughter, and family and staff have done. The Greek menu items and daily specials like Moussaka. Corned beef prime rib.and walleye are to die for.  The staff is hard working and talanted. They have high chairs for kids .plenty of parking and tables. We are very lucky indeed."}
{"text":"Quintessentially Cleveland, George's Kitchen is pretty brilliant. It's a working man's diner and a family restaurant. It's oozing with character and charm and all it takes is one visit. As soon as you walk in you'll be greeted with smiles and a friendly \"Sit anywhere you like, hon.\" There's a counter that runs the length of the kitchen to the right and plenty of seating both booth and table. 

If I had to describe the decor I'd say it's functionally kitschy. You know the places that shop around for odds and ends in an attempt to make their restaurants look funky and lived in? Well, George's invented that look and I doubt it's changed much over the last 30 years. Formica counters, hanging plants, mirrored walls, greying drop ceiling panels and green Naugahyde. And there's something about the smell of a place like George's, that soothing and comforting odor of grease, coffee, bacon and slightly burnt toast. I've only ever eaten here for breakfast so I can't attest to the lunch and dinner ambiance. I'd imagine it's just as good.

Another thing I can't help notice is how the waitresses, white shirted and black aproned, are always busy. I don't think I've ever been in here when there hasn't been at least three ladies busily plugging away behind the counter slicing bread, making salads, preparing for lunch and dinner service. No one stands around. No one is texting. No one is wasting a second. These women know what it means to work for a living. On our most recent visit our server, an older woman, matronly, like a grandma, European accent still in tow, took care of us well. Like we were eating at her own table. We've never had poor service here and doubt that we ever will.

The food, where to begin. Like I said, for me, George's is a breakfast joint. If you're looking for a breakfast full of comfort foods, stick to your ribs foods, foods that will transport you back to a time when people didn't give a shit about cholesterol and trans fats, you are in the right place. This is a place where you can order seconds of bacon and white bread toast and you won't elicit stares from the vegans in the next booth. This is a place where even the steak and eggs platter will cost you less than $8. My wife adores their pancakes. They're fluffy, buttery and as big as your head. And the omelets? Huge and full of fresh ingredients. The coffee is hot, not terribly strong and always refilled. 

I can't say enough good things about George's. It's what Cleveland would look like if it was personified by a restaurant. It's friendly and inviting even to first-timers and the food is cheap, served fast and without pretense. And before you start to think I'm some weepy-eyed sentimental, it's not perfect. If you tried I'm sure you could find something to complain about, maybe it's not white glove clean, maybe it's a bit dated, maybe the eggs they use aren't cage free and organic, but taken as a whole, dings and dents included, it's a piece of my city and it's a good one."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place food service prices are awesome . When you dont feel like cooking and dont want to dress up this the place ."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome! I went during prime brunch time on a Sunday but still managed to be seated right away! Service was really quick and efficient, which I am not used to from most other breakfast places. 

As for the food, it was great! Very traditional, greasy diner food. I wouldn't recommend George's if you are in the mood for a \"healthy\" breakfast option. 

The decor was old time diner, which was pretty sweet. The old metal swinging doors and traditional diner bar and stool made for a really enjoyable outing!"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in town and wanted to grab a bite to eat so after reading a ton of yelp reviews on different places in the area we decided on George's. I wanted to give them 3.5 stars ,but honestly 4 is what they deserve when it comes to their food! 3 stars on service, 2 on friendliness and 2 on cleanliness ... the first and crazy thing is where to go to get sat?? We stood at the front door then moved a Lil towards the side then we were instructed to go to the center and wait, it was confusing and a Lil frustrating being we had a family member that was using a cane, and really isn't well enough to be moved around from place to place without a seating option. When we sat the table was messy and the gentlemen was rude he spot cleaned our table and by spot I mean dabbed 2 areas when both the booth and table should have been throughly wiped down! Then this guy literally just tosses our menus on the table and walked away at this point we wanted to leave! The menu was huge so big it was hard to decide luckily we were all in the mood for fish fry. I was in the mood for a Greek salad ,but our server says believe it or not were a Greek restaurant without Greek dressing I thought well fish it is... now we're nervous did we make a bad decision? should we just say forget it and find somewhere else? Well glad we didn't because we all ordered our kids spaghetti and meatballs, and ocean perch dinners for the rest of us. Our meals came with so many sides we initially didn't even Want them,but once again we were glad we did! Fish on point serioulsy it was good! Mac n cheese tasted homemade my hubby doesn't even like Mac n cheese and he tore it up! The coleslaw was good I actually ate mine with my meal and my hubby's today for lunch (: they had 2 soup options chic noodle and potato I had the chic noodle it tasted homemade it was very good and the rest of us chose potato they kept saying wow this soup is delish! Service was just ok she just had a attitude about her but she kept on us so maybe she was having a moment or maybe it's her personality honestly as a server/bartender usually I'd be more critical ,but she did keep on our table so my only advice is to put a Lil pep in her step try to smile a Lil bit more and I'd also try not to talk bad about your place of employment to customers it almost turned us off this place altogether. All in all I can only speak for the fish and spaghetti they were really good and I'd go back anytime we were in town. Hopefully they fix their waiting to seat area, a few Peoples attitudes, maybe wipe down tables before seating guests and I'd be happy."}
{"text":"First, let me say that this four star rating is for the not so great service that received with some very good food. When the waitress was bringing four glasses of drinks to our table, she turned one over on our table. No big deal because accidents will happen. The problem is that she took so long to take pur order. Some people that came in after us, got their order taken and food deliver before pur order was taken. I read the reviews a out the food, so this is why I didn't get up and walk put because of the service. I'm glad that I stayed because the food was great. The cornbeef hash and very good, and the hotcakes were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"There is little doubt too much of my time and money are spent cooking. That means reading cookbooks, shopping all over town for spices, gadgets and appliances,  preparing ingredients, cooking, and the worst two--cleaning afterward and finding places for things. The last month or so I have been limiting time spent by dining out more, getting carry out and buying prepared food. 

I have found most often I go to George's Kitchen. Here is the food that appears on kitchen tables all over the country. It is the home cook's meals that influence us and we remember all our lives. Celebrity chefs have little effect on what people eat at home or what they will remember most. George's extensive menu includes American classics as well as the ethnic dishes most of us have learned to cook in our own kitchens. 

I found this restaurant from reading yelp reviews that decried the surplus population of senior citizens who dine here. That sold it for me. I much prefer to dine amongst my peers who are polite and have accomplished so much. Thanks to the young Cleveland yelpers for guiding me to a place where I get good home cooking at such low prices."}
{"text":"Huge portions, delicious diner food, and low prices, but this place gets -packed- and the staff can get a little overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and crazy fast service! Great family joint and perfect for breakfast. Homemade chicken noodle soup is to die for and they're great for breakfast, lunch, and even dinner.  Best of all, pretty much every meal is 6.99 or less! Soup and sometimes salad is included along with bread and butter."}
{"text":"This is a rare occasion for me 5  stars. The staff from the door to seating to being served was extremely helpful fast and beyond effecent. The waitress, I believe was Molly was very nice and helpful. Now the food, both the wife and I got the corned beef hash breakfast, 3 eggs, hash browns, corned beef hash and toast, all for $6.25 a plate. We also had two coffees, and one OJ. All of that for under $20. The only down was the hash wasn't cooked to crispy, but that's a preference and request to order feal, which is understandable."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and good both times. The foods is inexpensive and very tasty. Steak and eggs for under $8. Service was fat, friendly and we were seated right away for a Saturday morning. Is not in the best part of town, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is absolutely the most ridiculously cheap restaurant in the greater Cleveland area, which says something since Cleveland restaurants tend to be very affordable.  It used to be that you could get a good lunch here for under $4.  The prices have recently gone up, but they're still very cheap.  There may be cheaper places in town, but they are either junk/fast food, or they don't have a nice sit-down atmosphere like this place does.

The selection here is very typical, like a diner but with a smaller menu, standard American food.  Specials are rotated on a days-of-the-week basis and it often makes sense to get specials.  There's enough selection to satisfy most people.  The best thing about the menu is how it is possible to itemize things without paying through the nose: this is a good place to go if one person in your party wants a light meal and the other one wants a lot to eat.

Quality?  Consistent and good.  You will find no culinary masterpieces but you will always find good eating.  Portions are very reasonable: you get your fill, but you don't stuff your face.

The service here is also very good.  And the atmosphere is pleasant.  And the location, although odd, is oddly convenient (once you figure out how to get here!).

Basically, you can't go wrong with this place.  It is very affordable, consistently good, and excellent value for your money."}
{"text":"I will return...

I had a Cuban Sandwich there and it was to die for! I hear that it's open 24 hours? Sounds like a good place to go to to cure the hangover! I'll eat another Cuban Sandwich as well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very old school diner feel! When you walk in; you seat yourself. A server comes right to you and brings you a glass of water and menu! The servers are so nice and friendly! I love the atmosphere! It's a real home- like comfortable- like feel. I ordered from their breakfast menu! I ordered 2 hot cakes a side of sausage and bacon! It was okay! I mean the food was good, but not like um um good! The food is mad cheap though!!!! Mad cheap!!!  You get a lot for what you pay! Would I come back?  Hmmmmm yeah because their prices for food are cheap!"}
{"text":"George's Kitchen does not have the best food in Cleveland, the best food in West Park, or possibly even the best food on Triskett Road.

What George's Kitchen has is GOOD FOOD that is NEARLY FREE.  And character.  Tons and tons of character."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Very filling. Friendly staff. I love the chicken noodle soup!! The bestt"}
{"text":"Rarely are Yelp reviews off but after seeing 4 stars, I figure I had to stop in.

Well and unless the regular cook was off today, the breakfast was mediocre. I ordered the eggs with Gyro meat (includes toast and home fries), 3 pancakes, and a coffee.

The eggs and potatoes were bland and the gyro meat is the rectangular shape you get out of supermarket. The pancakes were decent at a shade of light golden brown. The coffee...yuck yuck yuck. It was watery and I sense it's the lowest grade one can buy.

You come here for quantity and the price as the whole meal was exactly $10."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and quick service all at very reasonable prices!

They have homemade specials every night of the week that include the entree, soup, salad, bread and butter.

Tonight I ordered the Greek mousaka which also came with soup (tonight's specials are homemade bean or chicken noodle).  Hubby got the 1/2 pound cheeseburger which came with macaroni salad, coleslaw and French fries.  He also got the freshly made iced tea.  

Everything was so flavorful!  Huge helpings (I needed a to-go box), and the best part was it all cost under $20!"}
{"text":"I've lived very close to this place for 6 years and this is my first visit. It won't be my last. This place is justifiably crowded, but runs with amazing efficiency. Delicious corned beef hash omelette and nicely crusty potatoes nearly as fast as a drive through. Affordable and unpretentious, great neighborhood family restaurant. I'll return."}
{"text":"Good breakfast diner food-greasy and delicious. Staff is friendly and efficient. Just know you'll have to wait on weekends. They had a bunch of empty sections and booths not being used and a huge line so not sure what that was all about."}
{"text":"George's best asset is the value. For lunch I had a walleye dinner. The fish was battered and fried and very good. I also enjoyed the cole slaw, but found the home fries and chicken noodle soup to be rather bland. The portions were huge and the whole meal was under $7.

It's kind of a divey diner, but seems to be kept clean. Service was quick."}
{"text":"This place is just, wrong. i.e., gone downhill, gross. we stopped in here 3 weeks ago I think for the first time in 10 years, perhaps on nostalgia. Back then yes, it tasted great, like good \"morning after\" a big night out, lazy Sunday brunch and good deal place to go. Now, either we've grown more sophisticated in our choices for what to eat, or the plethora of great restaurants to get fresh, quality food in CLE has skyrocketed. It's the 2nd part of the equation here.

Can't say it's a typical diner, greasy food experience as any restaurant can serve greasy food if cooked unproperly. With George's, everything we ordered tasted like frozen cooked to order, nothing was fresh. Even their home fries tasted like what you can buy in a grocery store. Why wouldn't a restaurant make their own homefries? Sausage gravy - watery, nasty. Greek omelet the feta tasted like pellets, not real feta. Their \"homemade soups, news for you - many restaurants soups are comprised of leftovers they're trying to use up. George's is no exception both with their \"homemade\" chicken noodle and chicken orzo. Both were heaping glops of a mess. There's a reason that soup, salad, 2 sides come with entres. Wow, what a deal right? No. Their dinner salad consisted of semi-brown iceberg lettuce, 1 cherry tomato and 2 slivers of cucumber that looked like they were halfway to becoming pickles :( !!.
There comes a time when diners will stop compromising food quality for supposed \"value\" and \"big portions\". The time has come and I don't think place's like George's will survive unless they adapt to the times."}
{"text":"You don't need a yelp review to know this place is the bomb (yep I said it.)  Go here on a Saturday or Sunday and the line will be out the door! Why? Because it's simple, cheap, good food that comes to your table at lightening speed!  It's what you expect in a greasy spoon diner and never disappoints.  Well, the \"special\" brown sauce on the country chicken might disappoint.  That's the only thing on the menu I do not recommend.  Aside of that, their omelets are my favorite and the biscuits and gravy are really good too!  Chicken noodle soup is A++++!!!!"}
{"text":"So I am not from the neighborhood, but went here with a neighborhood regular.  I don't know how much that helped.  This place is a definite throwback to the 1960's and 70's concept of a comfort food diner.  It represents a time when there were actual neighborhood diners, not the fabricated neighborhood diners that are actually parts of national chains.  There is something to be said for local ownership that captures the spirit (and business) of a working class neighborhood.  This place certainly does.  It is clean, and well kept.  Certainly not dreary.  Menu is large, stocked with classic comfort food items.  All served with soup (salad extra) and sides.   Prices are small (generally less than $10) and portions are generous.  You will likely be heading home with extra food.  Service is friendly and attentive. I ordered the walleye.  Two HUGE pieces of freshly breaded and fried fish.  Not at all greasy.  Great baked potato and slaw.  Soup was a bit salty, but most are.  Stir fry could feed a small army.  Salad is basic, not fancy but good.  If you are looking for light, healthy food, don't waste your time.  If you are looking for gourmet and adventurous food, don't waste your time.  If you are looking for hearty, well prepared food that is a good value and served by friendly people that capture the spirit of the diverse Westpark neighborhood, this is the place to go.  This place cries out to be featured on a cable foodie show."}
{"text":"Love love love Georges. .. Cheap good food, fast service,  big portions... what more could u ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food, inexpensive, breakfast as it was meant to be. Have the corned beef hash...so good!!  We found this place just driving around. The parking lot was packed, which should give you an indication of how good the food is. The wait staff is very friendly, the service is prompt!  Breakfast is served all day; we came to this restaurant twice and had breakfast both times (because of the time of day.  But the menu is long & full of options for all tastes!  This is comfort food, Midwest dining & it's best!"}
{"text":"Tons of good food and VERY reasonably priced. Staff was very friendly and even George said help to us I highly recommend it. Thank You So Much Yelp for directing us to this greasy spoon."}
{"text":"A diner that just welcomes you with open arms and home cooked goodness.  The prices are incredibly low for what you get.  Huge portions of warm your heart meals.  This isn't your trendy, hipster gastropub.  This is a blue collar, old school diner filled with real people.  The service here is incredible as well.  I always get their pork chops with Greek Style sauce.  The chicken noodle soup is primo!  Along with that, this my choice location for breakfast.  The hash is awesome.  Keep going strong George!"}
{"text":"George's is the place to go for comfort food without a lot of frills. The food is tasty and plentiful, and the prices are cheap. This is a great place for people watching, because it's clear that there are lots of \"locals\" and much friendly camaraderie between staff and guests. At George's things like decor take a back seat to good food served up hot and fast. They were accommodating of dietary restrictions and quick with refills on coffee and water.  Definitely a good place for filling up."}
{"text":"I was visiting outside of Cleveland last month for a funeral. On the way to the airport. We all decided to eat at George's Kitchen. I did not know what to expect. Because, it looked like an old restaurant on the outside. But, don't let that fool you. The food is great and so is the split pea soup they have. I also suggest to try their cheese sticks. It is different along with their marinara sauce it is so good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice big cheap dinner, George's Kitchen is for you! The place has an old timey diner feel with a friendly staff. Food usually comes out quickly and portions are huge. The menu is large enough to have something for everyone."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes you feel 6 years old again, it is like stepping back in time and going out for breakfast with your Grandparents. The food is delicious with very generous portions. The price is really great. Hands down one of the better breakfast places in town."}
{"text":"We love Michelle. She's always very attentive and friendly. 
Really good comfort food. Large menus. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The menu is huge and EVERYTHING is good you can't go wrong with anything you choose. Also everything is INEXPENSIVE gotta love that! food always comes out fast no matter how busy they are. Great for the fam  or great if you and your friends had a few too many the night before. Also very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had brunch here and it was exactly what you would expect: reliable diner food. The sausage gravy was excellent. Nothing at all to complain about - the service was good and friendly. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I am disappointed. Sure it is really cheap, but the food tastes like cardboard. It baffles me that this place has a decent rating. The last time I went I swore off returning. I will gladly take quality over quantity any day."}
{"text":"I love George's Kitchen. Best breakfast in North East Ohio. Great staff and fast service. The country fried steak is my favorite but other dishes are equally as tasty. Highly recommend George's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow Yelpers for their review. I took the wife and kids for breakfast. The placed is packed with people and the service is very quick. The coffee was great, loved the hash browns and can't beat the price. $28.00 for 4 people. We will definitely be back again. I guess the kids were good and each got two lollipops when we cashed out. A great place for Sunday breakfast with the family! 

Carry on!!"}
{"text":"Food here was great and the portions were huge. Staff was super nice and very accommodating. Crowded when we aww arrived although service wasn't slowed.

It has that classic diner look, but minus 1 star because maybe a little remodeling and extra cleaning would make this place more appealing to a larger clientele."}
{"text":"Food is average to poor, but the place is so chaotic that I was lucky to get out of there without an ulcer.  It almost seems like the owners/managers like it like that. There are many great places to eat in the neighborhood; this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? The only thing that I had tonight that wasn't a cheap, processed bulk food was the iced tea. I can't believe people have rated this place so high! 2 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"Dear lord, I love you George. Please never leave me. I get confused because there are so many breakfast diner places with male names but George I will forever remember... Best one-morning stand to date. 

I love breakfast food, it's the best part about waking up. What's even better is when somebody else makes it for you, and cherry on top is when it is made for you by a seasoned breakfast making veteran and very cheap. The wait was long, but worth it. Such a tease, sitting there at the counter and seeing others with their food!! Ordered the country chicken (which are just chicken fingers ) and the corned beef hash, with a side of potato latkas. I recommend all three."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get breakfast on the west side. Cheap awesome food, great waitresses. Omlettes are to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month and often try new things on the menu. I'm usually pleased with everything I order and today I feel the same. Cool diner feel with affordable prices!"}
{"text":"be prepared .. other than being in a traditional diner car this place is about as \"diner\" as you can get in Cleveland .. totally no frills .. could use a good scrubbing w/a big soapy brush from time to time but the service is quick .. the prices reasonable & the food delicious .. the portions are HUGE .. & that is what a diner experience is about .."}
{"text":"For a budget diner, it is a five star place. Large plates, reasonable prices. Very laid back."}
{"text":"Me and my grandma used to come here, she past away recently, and I decided to come back for memories. Let's just say, a lot can change in a couple of months. The service was horrible and the waitress seemed not to happy to be working."}
{"text":"I walked in, sat down, ordered my food, got my food, finished my food, and left faster than I can write this review. If you are in the mood for amazing and ridiculously cheap sit down food, and you need to get in and out in 15 minutes, George's kitchen is the place to go."}
{"text":"I cannot get over the price for this place. Let me put it this way: it was so cheap that I bought two meals thinking the portions would be small; they weren't small and I ended up going home with an entire meal intact. Each of the entrees we bought averaged about $7 a piece and came with at least one side. 

I loved the portion sizes and price but overall the food was just OK. I guess it's one of those \"you get what you pay for\" kind of things. It's definitely a greasy spoon diner as described by others.  It's great comfort food. I got a meatball sub with french fries and a chicken parm sandwich with home fries. One of the meals came with a side salad, but I can't recall which one. Nothing stellar about either of the meals except the chicken parm cutlet covered both halves of the bun. It was huge! I had to cut off a chunk and eat it separate from the sandwich. Hash browns could have used a little more cooking throughout to make more of the potatoes crispy. 

Overall, George's had solid portions for the price. The service was super friendly and very helpful, always making sure we had drinks or whatever we needed. I'll definitely be back to try more meals when I'm looking for a hefty portion of comfort food."}
{"text":"Staff is super nice, food is super affordable, i like the layout of the place. Yea it's a little old/greasy spoonish but this is cleveland not westlake LOL. My uncle always talked about this place and finally i went with him and had a nice corned beef and swiss with soup and salad for like 6dollars i believe."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Excellent excellent food and service.  It's a great place. Had the Veal parmigiana today with spaghetti and it was very good.  Nice healthy portions at this place, AND THE PRICES! Beyond affordable.  It's almost as if you're stealing.   Thanks to my friend Melissa for turning me on to this place."}
{"text":"The food is always great. Cheap, quick and good. The menu is big and you can always find something you want.  The serving staff can be a bit rude some times and its always busy so some times it can be a bit cramped."}
{"text":"Perfect post hockey game breakfast! Review primarily based on speed of service and excellent waitress. Boys loved it. They kept asking when we could go back. Too bad we don't live on the west side. Obviously lots of regulars. 

Biscuits & gravy were really tasty and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Old time Cleveland classic.  You hungry for a great breakfast-this is the joint not pricey. Great service.  Very fast.  I got the Corned Beef hash& eggs + 3 stack of hotcakes.  I waddled out- serious food!   Loved it"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food don't hesitate to get over here wait if needed because you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Amazing and cheap breakfast!! Service was great! Really good coffee. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Been a customer of this establishment for 30 yrs.  I have nothing but excellent things to say. Extremely friendly staff, pricing, quality, quickness....just naming a few. The servers are awesome. Though we have one that stands out, The others we've had are quality servers. Keep it going. Never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere it reminds of the movie pupil fiction and the omelettes are really good. The price is right! I will be back for years to come."}
{"text":"Comfort food at a great value. You get a lot of food. Place gets really busy during breakfast time on weekends. I have only ordered from breakfast menu."}
{"text":"As a 3-month visitor from Phoenix, I was jazzed to come to a new city, scroll through yelp, and eat everything in sight. I'm living in Westlake, so George's Kitchen is one of the highest rated places on this side of town--add to the fact that I love breakfast more than anything...we had a great thing going. 

For me, its hard to give breakfast bad reviews. There's not much to it. But George's diner reminds me of a Denny's that isn't a chain. Way too much random food to do anything great, basics covered (but nothing special). It may be too much to ask to compare Georges to a local place that has an interesting local menu or specials. Its no surprise that when I drive around Cleveland that there are so many horrible pseudo breakfast chains with lines out the door. 

This place IS locally owned (+ 1 star). This place will allow most people to be content (+ 1 star). This place is stupid cheap (+1 star). Also the coffee was not good (-.5 star). Round up and 3 stars it is.

There's nothing that will deter anyone from going here, but if you are a breakfast foodie--not your place. 

I got the hash. My friend got pancakes, My fiance got eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredibly filthy. Just look around. When I went to sit down to meet a friend, a roach was on the table, during the day, dining on syrup that hadn't been wiped up. My napkin was resting in a wet spot. The waitress was wiping across her nose with her index finger. I am so surprised that during the last food inspection in February of 2018, they didn't notice the overall filth and the roaches. I guess this isn't included in the inspection. I wonder why? The walls, the carpeting, the shelves, the equipment is just incredibly disgusting. I don't think anything has been properly cleaned in decades. Gross! gross! gross! 

The eggs are tasteless and not properly cooked to medium."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some good breakfast food. George's was near our destination and had excellent reviews, so we decided to give it a try. The parking lot was so full when we arrived that we almost didn't bother stopping. Boy am I glad we did! Despite the fact that they were full, we had a table almost immediately and our food took very little time to be prepared.

I ordered country chicken: chicken tenders and biscuit with hashbrowns and sausage gravy - my better half ordered their famous corn beef hash with eggs, toast, and hashbrowns. As a southerner who rarely finds a good biscuit and gravy plate here in the midwest, I was pleasantly surprised. And the homemade corn beef hash was better than imagined. 

Excellent food, excellent service, and excellent prices - you definitely cannot go wrong with George's."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, homestyle food! I've been a regular my entire life (literally since I was a baby). Pancakes, eggs, and bacon is under $4 during the week, and just over a dollar more on the weekends. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Was pleased with my first visit but this one was subpar. 

Was actually going to hit up Wendy's but since it was Friday, I wanted the mac and cheese... It's almost like Stouffers but not quite as good. Not worth the weeks I've been waiting to try it. Got the BBQ ribs for the entree... can't decide if there was more meat or fat. Salty and not enough sauce. Got the cole slaw because the salad was so blah last time... Not doing better. The bread remains stale. Haven't touched my soup but too fill to try it.

I only ate about 2/3 of the meal, not going to finish the rest. Not worth the calories. Should have just went to Wendy's like I started too. Would have been cheaper and tastier."}
{"text":"Decided on breakfast here after reading reviews & they did not disappoint!  For starters, I went with two coworkers out of town on business & we were in a hurry to get to the office on time. One of my coworkers mentioned this to the waiter (not something I would have done) & she was understanding promised to be as quick as possible.

I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes? Buttery and moist. So good I took several bites before adding syrup! The bacon? Crispy! Which is all I ask for. Not super crunchy or burnt but a nice crisp, not chewy or fatty.

Last of all, my coworkers each had some type of two egg breakfast plate and a coffee. Our total together was only $17 and some change. Great food, great service and affordable. Great way to start the morning for sure!"}
{"text":"Just your typical diner.

In search of a heart warming diner and having been used to eating in diners back in Michigan, we decided to give George's a try.

it's a rather large diner and can seat a lot of people. The waitress showed us to our seats and we looked at the menu. Typical prices- and when our plates came out, they were huge!

I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs- the corned beef hash was just okay- nothing super special about them. It wasn't too greasy, but it wasn't fantastic either- I thought the quality of the food was just okay.

Also, for whatever reason, our server was no where to be found though... we wanted some more coffee/water, and we literally had to get up and find a waitress to ask for some more. That put a damper on the meal- at least have someone take care of us?

George's is just your typical diner though- nothing to rave about, but it does the job when you're looking for diner food."}
{"text":"I come here so often with the roomates for ugly breakfast. Its cheap and easy and right up the road. I'm just still peeved about them changing the sugar canisters."}
{"text":"Well I was at 4 star but it's gotten worse today I ordered country fried steak which was wonderful but received burned home fries and burned toast . No pride whoever put this in this to go box the servers are still the super friendliest but the food is rolling the dice now at George's it's 50 50 u might get a good meal or it might be flawed . I sometimes like to roll the dice so I'm gonna say it is still worth eating There I'm just not gonna go out of my way too!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this neighborhood diner for years and have probably sat down to an average of three meals a month. There's nothing like George's for Sunday breakfast!

Like the other reviews mention, the service is fast and friendly, the food is good, cheap and plentiful, the menu choices are never-ending, and there is never a wait for parking or tables. Also, it may sound strange, but I think that George's has the fizziest, most delicious fountain soda in town!

The prices are super inexpensive - I think our largest bill at George's was $30, and that was with 4 people - and each meal came with bread, salad, soup AND sides, and beverages. 

The waitresses are total pros, and will get your order out to you in record time. 

I do wish they had more vegetarian options, but I am always happy to get a grilled cheese with tomatoes or delicious pancakes. A veggie burger option would be awesome, but in the meantime, there are still plenty of things to choose from..."}
{"text":"Very good diner food. Service is fast and somewhat friendly....we are from the south and clevelanders are a little brusk. I had eggs, hashbrowns, gravy and toast. My husband had a gyro omelet which he said was very good. Lots of breakfast options. Nothing here is automated or premade."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast! Three huge plates of food came out hot in 9 minutes flat. Service is great, but they are moving fast and don't often have time for idle chit chat. It's really great when George himself seats you for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"My honey and I decided to jump off our low-carb diet for his birthday weekend and wanted to try George's, since everyone is always talking about it!
We got there around 10:30 on a Saturday morning and the place was hopping. Parking lot full, entry way crowded... we almost left thinking we'd never get a table. We were greeted right away and seated within two minutes. I was impressed with the size of the place- there was a ton of seating and lots of servers buzzing past. I loved the diner feel, with the old bar counter and round stools. But you're not here for the interior decorating, you're here for the grub!

I was feeling gluttonous and ordered two breakfasts- Mini-Belgian waffles with strawberry topping and Eggs with sausage and hashed browns. He got the corned beef hash side along 3 pancakes.  First of all, the food came out wicked fast. Our server was very friendly, but efficient. It's possible ::whispers:: that she was a robot.
Our food was amazing. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the waffles were a tad crisp but soft on the inside. Everything was hot and served about as quickly as it came off the skillet. It was a very generous portion. We got a ton of food- and he drank about 3 milks. Our bill was around $23. It was a good value for excellent food and service. This will become a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"How can you not give this place 5 stars...WOW!!!

Sure, it's a dive diner that looks like the 1960's when you walk in. What amazes me is the menu in the pics is accurate in That the prices go back to the 1970's. I mean I don't think anything on the menu is $10 and most entrees well below it. On top of that the food was very good. I had the Sunday special of turkey and dressing with 2 veggies. Also came with a very good bowl of chicken noodle soup and a small salad. 

I was eating an early dinner today so I also went with Apple pie ala mode. 

I am stuffed!!! 

When the bill came I thought I was way underpaying. They practically are giving the food away!! I don't see how they can stay in business but they do. Total bill with tea and tax was $12.90. The pie and ice cream was. $3,90. The turkey meal was $6.75. Incredible!!!

My table service was very good.

Specific scores are:
Taste of food was a 4
Quantity of food was a 5
Cost of food was a 5
Table service was a 4

Very good food, very good service and unbelievably low prices....come eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Dear George:

I want to apologize for not having found your kitchen sooner.  As it turns out, not only is it less than five minutes from my house, but your breakfast never dissapoints. I should have been eating your delicious corned beef hash with a side of crispy home fries months ago. I have no excuse. Your most delectable Western Omelette oozes with cheddar cheese and the American dream. George, the service you provide the West Park neighborhood is unparalleled by any other greasy spoon on the West Side.  

Love always,
Aubrey"}
{"text":"The nice price. George's is a great place for breakfast. They can accommodate large groups of thugs like my homies and me. They did yesterday. Cannot beat the prices with a stick. People like to come here and eat. The people are interesting."}
{"text":"Excellent local diner.  Breakfast was great - loved the corned beef hash!  Great choice."}
{"text":"So we arrive after a 5 hour flight starving at 8pm.  Needless to say we would have eaten at any hole in the wall but our trusty Yelp app brought us to George's Kitchen.  Boy were we happy.  This place does comfort food right.  It is a diner. But it is a diner the way it is meant to be right down to Flo type waitresses (you have to have grown up in the 70's to get that one).

The food was exactly how it was portrayed on the menu with large but not too large portions.  The service was fast despite the crowd.  Definitely will \"find\" this place again if I ever get back there."}
{"text":"This is a lovely old school restaurant full of delicious and well prepared comfort food. The staff is always top notch and friendly. I have never had an ok dish from there, they all have been fabulous. Their prices are the best. For a fast food combo meal price, you can sit down and have a very filling meal and that includes the tip!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant to go and eat. The portions are huge and the chicken noodle soup is delicious. Our waitress was Donna she was great and she was very funny made us feel right at home. I would recommend this place if you want a home cook meal."}
{"text":"The soups (chicken noodle and beef barley) were really great. My husband's prime rib dinner was good, but a bit over cooked. The brown gravy on my roast beef was a bit salty, but my dinner as a whole was very tasty. The chocolate meringue pie was amazing. The rice pudding (with raisins) reminded me of my grandmother's, and higher praise I cannot give."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood greasy spoon. Been goin here since i was a lil kid.
Donna's the best damn waitress in all of Cleveland!!! All the gals there hustle to take care of you. Place definitely could use a scrubbin and a make over but who cares as long as my food isnt gross.
Food is good, staff is awesome. Quick turn around so don't plan on hoggin a table for any amount of time. Love their chicken soup! When we're sick i swing by and order 4-8 cups to bring home"}
{"text":"George's Kitchen is a West Park staple.  If you want decent comfort/diner food and good service at a reasonable price, there's no place else.  Carry out service is second to none -- your order will be ready in less than 15 minutes.  Ordered takeout last night, and enjoyed their mac & cheese for the first time -- it was really great!  Recent experiences, both dine-in and carryout, have inspired me to scan their menu and add it here (I also shared a PDF version that should be easier to read, pending moderator approval).  The only downside is the amount of time it takes to decide what to order, since the menu to so large."}
{"text":"George's Kitchen is an inexpensive and delicious breakfast or brunch option.  The staff is dedicated to making sure you get seated as soon as possible. Our waitress was very attentive and our coffee and water were always full. They didn't skimp on portions. Very worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast, classic diner-style. This plate of food came out about 90 seconds after I ordered it, and it was all perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service.  It was our first time here and our waitress gave us some great suggestions and even brought us some samples.  All of the food was delicious.  I wish this place was closer to home (WI)!"}
