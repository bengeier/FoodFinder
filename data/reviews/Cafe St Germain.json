{"text":"Very nice brunch an lunch place. Clean atmosphere. Has a open kitchen with a low countertop.  Almost like if you are visiting someone's house. Meals were kinda pricey at $14-16. Although service was excellent and food seemed very health conscious. The best part is when you order a coffee you get a nice big mug of real good coffee instead of a tiny tea cup.  Only had brunch here on a Sunday. Will go again for a lunch."}
{"text":"This place is being sold, I guess the neighbourhood finally decided they don't need a dirty and mediocre cafe where something else better could be."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to take a trip there for lunch one day and the whole thing was a bit of a mess. I ordered a salmon salad which was very tasty and a nice sized portion but I told the owner I was allergic to some of the ingredients in the salad and to not add them in and not only did she not listen but when I had to send it back, as opposed to taking new ingredients as should be done with allergies, she picked out all the allergens. I was shocked. Luckily none of those allergies are life threatening but I could not believe that an owner would be so irresponsible with something as serious as allergies!! The salad I ended up receiving was delicious and my mom enjoyed her pear salad too which was a whopping $26 for the smallest salad portion I had seen in my life- it was so little that after she had to run to the grocery store and get a sandwich and it does not take a lot to power that woman! Being an entree, it should have been larger than the cup of my palms. After the whole allergy incident my mom was running late for getting back to work and their debit machine wasn't working.....which kept us another 15 minutes since the owner insisted on trying again and again and again and again though clearly it wasn't going. My mom had initially added a tip for the owner who served us telling her that we needed to get going and we were shocked again when she finally gave up after keeping us for way longer than she should have and when she was manually putting the payment into the old credit/debit mechanisms, she ADDED ON HER OWN TIP. So all and all we got ripped off, experienced health risks that should have not been taken, and both being late for getting back to our jobs when it was clear that the debit machine was not working. I will not tolerate that from any restaurant or service ever. WIll not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch. Delicious home made soup and a really good latte.
Charming place and owner."}
{"text":"People should be aware of the lack of sanitation and honesty that manifests in there.  Cafe St Germain is unprofessional, overpriced, and mediocre at best. You can see the owner pushing a no frills cart back and forth each day! I have no idea how the dump is still open."}
{"text":"So my mother and I were in a bit of a rush to eat, and I had to get the work in the next hour. So since we had just moved to the area, we were willing to explore what there was on Avenue Rd.

We came upon Cafe St Germain. It seemed to try hard to decorate itself, but the seating could have been better, and a lot of it was strange that they use chandelier moldings on one wall. The kitchen is a small exposed kitchen in the back corner. The wait staff was all huddled in the back most of the time.

I ordered the Chicken, Spinach and Cheese filled Crepe, and my mother ordered the Quinoa Salad. The glass of water arrived, I took a sip and was unpleasantly surprised by the tepid water that was served in the plastic looking cup. It seems they had just taken the glass out of the dishwasher. They did not seem to have any uniform sets of glasses, everything was different, and didn't match. The pitcher they used look like a Brita pitcher. 

The food came, and it was a crepe with some cheddar cheese melted on top, a salad and some other garnishings. Inside the meal wasn't too piping hot, the cheese was melting though. It tasted pretty bland, but protein is protein, and I still ate it. But it was really just \"meh\". 

The quinoa salad was pretty great that my mother had ordered. I usually put quinoa in my porridge, but this was great.

For what we ordered it came out to around $31 total. If I went to Old Yorke Fish and Chips, I could order a family pack of haddock for that price."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm not sure what to say here.  I was just in for a quick lunch, and while eating with my girlfriend, a pair of police officers came in to speak with the owner.  I'm not sure what about, but I've never seen a person act so insane in my life.  The owner just started screaming at the police, and threatening them and saying that she pays their salaries and they can't tell her what to do.  She also very loudly told them that she 'didn't have to pay her employees if she didn't want to' and it was a terrible scene.

I was embarassed just to be there.  I don't know what it was about exactly, but I don't think I want to eat at any restaurant run by a person like that.

food was okay, nothing wrong there.  Shame about the owner having a screaming match with police in the middle of lunch though."}
