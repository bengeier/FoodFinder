{"text":"Tough call on Sauce. When it opened in 2007/8 ish, they won awards for their burgers and for good reason. They are terriffic. Otherwise, Sauce is hot or cold. They have a couple of good dishes, the burgers, the Mac and Cheese, the pot pie, that you'll certainly enjoy. As of late though, their once stellar service has declined severely. I'd say they are on the verge of two stars but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, they were short staffed both days. Good solid burger spot, but be prepared to sit and wait."}
{"text":"Pretty okay. Fun to go here with my family because there was stuff for all of us to eat, and the beer specials are impressive. The pot pie looked fun, and the mac n cheese was pretty fab. I can't vouch for the pizzas or burgers, but the southern style comfort food was good and there was a ton to take home for leftovers. Friendly but sub-par service when we were there."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. The first time the service was ok and the food was good, so went went back a couple months later and ended up getting food poisoning. Don't plan on ever going there again."}
{"text":"Not the greatest music the ice tea they leave out and they only really serve burgers but the burgers are good"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, when I walked into this place I was less than excited to eat here. It looked more like a biker bar than somewhere I wanted to eat but OMG was I wrong. I got the Salisbury which was this beautiful steak on top of toast that had mushrooms and mashed potatoes and gravy on top. I also got the side of pierogis...all my life I thought pierogis were wet and drenched in butter, but this place changed my whole view. They were crunchy and served with onions, which I don't care for but they definitely added flavor. Everything came out in cast iron skillets and was PERFECT. The Salisbury came on toast like I stated DRENCHED in gravy like I stated BUT THE TOAST WAS STILL CRUNCHY. It was perfection. The waitress as well was such a sweet heart she was willing to have a conversation about the pierogis and really knew her menu. My favorite part comes in at the drink though. Anyone who knows me knows I'm obscenely fond of cherry Pepsi and they have an alcoholic version where its regular Pepsi with cherry vodka. This was good too although I'm not much of a drinker so I did need them to add a little more Pepsi near the end (which is good if you like a strong drink unlike myself) so happy to have found this place and I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Not again!  their burger suck not flavor at all.  i dont think they seasoned the meat at all, just threw poor quality (probly chuck full of pink slime) on the griddle and slapped it together.  so i cant understand why it took soooooo damn long. the mac and cheese was ok but honestly not worth the trip or the money. NEVER EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Up until my last visit I would have recommended this restaurant anyone. Based on this visit I will never recommend it again. Poorly cooked food combined with even worse service. I was there for about 90 minutes. I waited for the waitress to return after delivering two attempts at my burger. I waited for at least 10 minutes for her to return with my credit card.  Yelp made me pick at least one star, this explains my higher than desired rating."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in area. The menu was just expanded as well. The service is also very good. I usually go once a week there for HH and the family and I usually eat there every other week. Recommend a burger, chili, or Mac n cheese. Also I was just there and they have changed their wings and added new flavors. They were really good! I always thought their wings were just good but now they are very good! Bartenders are friendly. By far one of my favorite places to go in the area."}
{"text":"Reviews depend on the reviewer and his/her age background.  I'm 46, have a 13 and 5 yr old.   My wife and I have been going since it opened.  Sure, it's raised prices and sometimes we get a clueless server, but they still have $2.50 beer bottle specials each night and the best burgers and Mac & cheese around.  Kids get free cotton candy (from the basement machine).  They have kids meals.  My wife and I go to the bar sometimes on a date-night.  I sip Padron tequila w/ a beer.  It's all about the pour and they give heavy ones at a reasonable price.  Not a chain and not fancy, but try the Strip District skillet burger w/ Kobe beef.  To die for if excellent bar food is your thing."}
{"text":"Waited too long for our food. Never got my cole slaw. Was told that the cole slaw they had went bad, so they were making new. I finished my burger, and still no cole slaw. Wont go back."}
{"text":"This place has really fallen off for the last couple of years. I hope they can take reviews like this and bring their standards back up to where they were when I really enjoyed eating here. Worn sticky dirty. And for a Burger place I had to ask if the cook wouldn't mind not smashing out all of the juice from my very dry burger. Bummer"}
{"text":"My food was burned beyond recognition. I asked for medium, and it was blackened. I sent it back and got a raw burger. If Burgers are your business, you think they could discern between the different levels of done-ness. Went back and food was not prepared well. We were seated across from the cooks and could see that they were not that clean. Perhaps it has changed based on the other positive reviews, but my experiences have been horrid."}
{"text":"I asked the server if the pierogies side dish was good, to which she replied yes. Got served lukewarm mini Mrs. Ts. Here in Pittsburgh that is sacrilegious. My pulled pork sandwich tasted like the pork had been sitting around for a few days. The only thing keeping this from being a 1 star was the pretzel and cheese app that was decent."}
{"text":"Ugh Bland burger because the meat was substantial but not flavorful or tender  Sorry to say it but that's it"}
{"text":"Slooooow service.  Don't go unless u have plenty of time to kill.  Also, the music is way too loud.  The food is ok.  Skillet fries are good.  Burgers are just ok.  My medium well was burnt on the outside and too pink in the middle."}
{"text":"The food was good other than my order coming out incorrect. However, the service was subpar at best. The atmosphere is strange and the beer list is sad. I would come back but probably for lunch rather than a late dinner. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for somewhere to eat dinner. There are plenty of other restaurants in the immediate area that are much better establishments"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible in every way.  First we encountered a loud, dark, dirty hole of a room.  Then waited forever, while being eyed up by the trashy locals at the bar, to get a disgusting table and be seated by a rude 12 year old. Then there's the food.  The burgers are awful.  The base is an overcooked bland piece of meat. I got the \"Cuban\" which also had a cold piece of lunch meat like ham on it.  The wings and chips we ordered were also burnt and not edible.  When we mentioned this, we were told that is how they are. When our eyes started watering at the end of the meal, we were told by a waitress that we knew that it happens when they cut onions in the basement. WTF??? Why the hell would anyone go here twice?  Stay away!"}
{"text":"03/07/5 Terrible food service worse.  My daughter took us out for lunch so we could celebrate my birthday.  There were seven of us and I was embarrassed for my daughter.  She was trying to do something nice and it was a disaster.  I called for a manager and  did not get an adequate apology for this disaster we waited 1 1/2 hours for appetizers. Everyone was hungry and it turned out terrible.  Let us say neither the wait staff or the manager gave the impression they cared.  We were not alone the people around us felt the same way.  Needless to say we will not be back.  We finally got our lunch 2 1/2 hours /since we got in there.  Then  we had to send a lot back because it was inedible.  They were busy but not slammed.  Hamburger and fries should not take that long We learned our lesson.  I intend to post this were others can read why they should not go to have food there.   With so many restaurant round why go there. They should have comp our food and others around us too. Terrible  no need for this."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is the worst food and service i have experienced at a restaurant, and I am by no means picky.   Let's start with the food. The person that I was eating with had the buffalo barbeque burger and mac and cheese, and said that it was ok. I had the sirloin tips wrap, and ordered it medium rare. The meat (what i could find of it) was gray on the inside and charred on the outside. The fries were soft and came  in a pool of cool grease. When the waitress checked back about 10-12 minutes after bringing the food, I told her that the steak was overcooked. She literally looked at me and then walked away. You probably don't believe that, and I don't blame you, because I was sitting there in person and I didn't believe it either.  I thought that maybe she was comping the meal and was mad because she thought her check average (and tip percentage) would be less, and that's where the atitude came from, but when I got the check, low and behold the entire amount was there for the wrap.  In addition to that stellar service moment, I watched my drink sit on the bar of at least 10-20 minutes getting watered down until the bartender finally left the bar to bring it to me, wondering aloud where the waitress was. The drinks and busy bartender are what earned the two stars, definitely not the food service or food."}
{"text":"So the $6.50 lunch specials are worth a try. I had the Tuesday Ham BBQ special!   It's actually several slices of a deliciously baked fresh ham, carved, and stacked high. So generous !!  Side of the \" famous\" skillet Mac and cheese!  Saturday and Sunday breakfasts are from 8:88 till noon and the most expensive one is $7."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I got the pretzel egg sandwich for breakfast that was delicious but had absolutely terrible service!! We were the only people in there and waited 30 minutes for our food! It's an open kitchen and we saw the cooks chatting for a good 20 minutes before they pulled the ticket."}
{"text":"Make a burger from ground meat, cook it, serve it with some appropriate sides....  What a concept.  It might just catch on... Making a good burger is not so hard but getting one in a restaurant seems to be elusive for some reason.    This place is an honest good effort and I must highly recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the small side, meaning you often have to wait a few minutes for a table. The food makes the wait worthwhile, however, as they have some of the best mac n cheese around. Also worth trying is the skillet of fries drowning in cheese. It's not diet food, but it's definitely worth a trip out if you're looking to splurge a little."}
{"text":"A great change from the normal chain restaurants in the South Hills.  It's bar food, and normally done well.  The waitstaff can be inattentive, but I have no problem calling them over.  Nice little neighborhood place."}
{"text":"tried it twice and got very sick both times, refuse to go back"}
{"text":"Oh my god the Mac and cheese is to die for. Small place but great service and even better food. Great variety and menu choices."}
{"text":"I ate here last Saturday and the food and drinks were great! I had the fillet skewers over rice and ate the entire thing. We sat at the bar and had a great time with the bartender Jeanine. She made the visit really enjoyable and can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Sauce does great burgers. Good, I got that out of the way! My sweetie and I each have family that lives in Bridgeville, so we run erands in this area a lot. You can count on good food at fair prices here. I've tried almont every burger on their menu at least once. They also make the best \"restuant mac and cheese I've ever had. Yeah, I know. That's not so exciting, but it really is good. The service is usually just a bit better than average, sometimes excellent, but never bad. My only complaint is that mid-day the music is sometimes loud even for me. (And I'm a drummer...)  I do agree with some other posters that they slipped a bit from how good it was five years ago, but they seem to have it figured out and are back in the game again. Try them out the next time that you hit Bridgeville."}
{"text":"2 stars...quickly going downhill to 1. Our server has been to our table 2 times! 1st to take our drink order. Second time to drop off our drinks. My husband had to go to the bar to get drinks since our server hadn't been to our table. The food is good though! What a \"catch 22\". I live in this town and everywhere I go...not great service. This place used to give great service. Not sure what's going on tonight. It's not busy, so I can't chalk it up to the place being busy. Take out next time!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Not only was the wait for the food way too long, but the food was mediocre at best.  So many better burger options in Pittsburgh.  The owner/manager must not care about his/her customers.  All the reviews written are about how bad the service is.  If that's the case then why not make it better?"}
{"text":"I had a Mushroom & Swiss burger with bourbon sauce. He had a chili skillet \"messy jezzy\". We shared hand cut fries and onion straws. All was very good - we will stop in again. Clean place friendly & prompt staff."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening, we were seated immediately in the back room.  Waitress came quickly and we got our drinks quickly.  Then everything slowed to a crawl.  Ordered hamburgers and Mac n'Cheese.  We hoped to make a movie... It took over 45 min to get our food!!! Waitress saw that we were getting unhappy and said \" Oh yea, burgers take a L-O-N-G time to come out! \". Like we had screwed up and ordered the burgers. :p Finally food came, Mac n' Cheese was good, hamburgers were good, the french fries were mildly warm grease bombs.  Inedible, drippy, limp fries...after a 45 minute wait. Disappointing at best. Missed our movie.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Let me first say I like the lunch/dinner menu here. This review is for breakfast today. It was gross. Small menu but the food was bland and tasteless. Our poor server was all by herself to handle the entire restaurant. This resulted in LONG wait times. I ordered pancakes with apples. No mention anywhere of nuts. It came loaded with walnuts, which I'm allergic to. Server rushed them away and had them fire up new ones without me even asking. Breakfast pizza my wife had was tasteless. She ate only a portion of it. Daughter wouldn't eat her egg and cheese omelet which she normally loves. Had a starter of beignets and scones. Scones were completely raw in the middle. Again dinner there is usually great but breakfast was horrible."}
{"text":"The food is just OK.  There are items that are good (wraps and many of the appetizers) but the burgers are AWFUL!  They are cooked in a skillet and black on the outside no matter how you order it, and yet they are way too greasy too.  The burgers are straight up unappealing.  On top of that, the \"specials\" are only if you are sitting at the bar - you can't get the special prices at a table even when the bar is full.  BAD idea!"}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere for families during lunch. My wife and I each had a burger and side and sodas for $26. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Waitress inattentive, burgers were DRY, didn't bring complete order - forgot both of our sides. Never came back to ask how things were. I had been wanting to try their burgers...I wish I would've passed.  Would've had a better meal at Sonic. O-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for the great burgers & Mac.  Really love this place, but today was disappointing.  Took forever and cheese not melted on my burger and my hubby's burger was raw.  Not up to par at all."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, once to eat and once to drink. Personally I didn't care for the food nor did the kids.  On the drink night we ordered finger food stuff and it was okay. Isn't it always better with a buzz though? Then to see they were busted for bugs, rodents etc...Ewww. 2 stars at best. No thanks"}
{"text":"Yep, another sauce fan writing a review.  Unsure exactly why it is categorized as Italian.  Maybe fresh bar/local comfort food would be a more appropriate category as practically everything in Pitts area is pasta, pierogis, sausage, pizza and hamburgers.  Adjust to the carb load here has been a pleasant experience!    And yep, the best hamburger I have ever eaten.  I couldn't finish the whole huge burger so I brought it home and it was still good the next day.  Very rare quality for a burger.  And what is it with mac and cheese in Pittsburgh?  We moved here within the last year after spending many years in Phoenix and one in Columbus, OH and only here, in the south hills is a fascination with homemade style mac and cheese.  Hmm.  maybe its not the south hills but Pittsburgh as a whole?  I haven't explored much yet so all y'all will have to tell me.  (or is that yous/yinz - still learning)  The kids could live solely on kraft mac and cheese and this more homemade tasting one was so good I almost stole it from my son and forcibly traded my terrific hamburger.  But I didn't.  He's only 8 and wouldn't understand :).  The kids got the base product.  You can customize with add-ons like bacon, imported cheeses and so forth.  What a dilemma... the burgers are excellent, the mac and cheese is excellent and the steak salad my husband ordered was excellent, but all three were too big to order together.  so sad. :(   I' suppose we will have to go back repeatedly to work through the larger than expected menu.  Since they gave the kids free cotton candy, I suspect it won't be a problem.  Another weird thing about PA, besides the mac and cheese fetish, is you can bring your kids to a bar.  I suppose it has to be primarily a restaurant but this bar atmosphere was architecturally interesting, as it is in a local narrow old building.  This style of restaurant is fascinating to us and we enjoy it very much.  We went early with the elderly before it turned from restaurant atmosphere into bar atmosphere and had a really nice meal, with a good beer selection."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese is great. Burgers are decent with  Lots of options. The drinks are relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"I didn't have a burger, so I can't weigh in there, but it's so hard for me to argue with a 10\" cast iron skillet of mac'n'cheese. Three add-ins? OMG, I felt like a glutton just ordering it, but it was so delicious I instantly forgot about it. So yummy.  And the drinks were delicious. Seriously.  I can admit that our drink order got screwed up, but the server was so nice about fixing it, it just made me like the experience even more. It's not gourmet, but the portions are huge and the comfort scale is off the charts."}
{"text":"Sauce is usually where we end up when Burgh's is too busy and we're too hungry to wait. Burgers are ok, nothing special. The  Buffalo burger was not what I expected at all, it's actually a honey BBQ burger which was completely disappointing. I do like the fact that you can substitute a turkey burger for any of the burgers-the turkey has a lot more flavor. The mac and cheese for a side is awesome and quite honestly is probably the best thing on the menu. Definitely not my favorite place but the mac and cheese makes it worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered dinner to go from Sauce last weekend. We were both intrigued by the menu and thought that there were many interesting options. I ordered the tenderloin tips wrap with fries. The fries are fresh cut and delicious. The garlic herb wrap was spectacular. Where can I get some for my fridge? The steak was done how i ordered it and was tender. The one thing that my meal lacked was the signature dipping sauce! I'm not sure if it was forgotten due to it being a takeout order but I wouldn't expect a dry wrap from a place called \"Sauce.\" My husband ordered the pancetta bacon and gorgonzola chicken sandwhich with mac and cheese. He was surprised that the chicken was a full split breast. That's a lot of meat for 9$! He enjoyed the sandwhich and thought the sundried tomato mayo was flavorful. My favorite part of the meal was his side of mac and cheese. He could barely pry this bowl of smooth, creamy deliciiousness out of my hands. All in all, a decent meal for $20. Big menu with many options, just make sure you get the sauce."}
{"text":"I had the Best in the Burgh Fish Sandwich with my side of pierogi  with cheese sauce. This was my second time getting the fish and it was the best I have ever had... again! It's 11oz of fish which is huge but too good to not finish. The fish is so fresh tasting with the beer battered breading makes it irresistible. The pierogi was presented in a skillet with caramelized onions only to be dipped into a side of white cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was as amazing as you might see at a Mexican restaurant but fresh and thin consistency. The environment was pleasant with a sports bar playing sportscenter with music playing from their jambox. The service was friendly and hardworking which is always nice to see."}
{"text":"The drinks and burgers are awesome. The appetizers (perogies) were perfect. I advise trying any of the drink specials and their tacos (tues and thurs after 5). The waitstaff are friendly and they can really do excellent custom orders. I would prefer a little bit more flavor in my food but even that could be worked with enough sauces and spices. (See what I did there?)"}
{"text":"Anyone that says \"best burgers in town\" has no concept of what a \"best burger\" should be, if it is the best burger in town shy away from Bridgeville. Go ahead and let them cook it to shoe leather, I ordered med/rare and because the burger is so thick, and more likely the experience if the chef, I got a burger with 1/16\" inch of sear and 1\" of raw chuck two times until the third time when it was cooked to well done.  The patty is packed too tight to allow for proper cooking. The fries were adequate, nothing mind blowing.  My girlfriend ordered the skillet mac and cheese which seems to be the signature dish and perhaps Sauce should claim a little more \"best mac n' cheese\" and not so much \"best burger\". Ambiance of a dive bar, under lit, clean, and the staff is accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"I challenge you to find a better mac n' chee than what Sauce is putting out.  I've been to Sauce twice and both of the times I visited I ordered the made to order mac.  To be perfectly honest I haven't had better mac and I loves me some comfort food.  I've gone on off peak hours and I didn't have any problem with the service, so I can't comment to what others were saying about slow service.  To me, though, I'd put up with a little slow service or just get take-out for that mac.  The noodles are fat and cooked al dente.  The cheese sauce is thick, creamy, and as cheesy as mac n' chee sauce can get.  Adding the option to throw 3 ingredients of my choosing into that skillet of awesomeness is more than enough for me to continue going back for it.  I can't understand how other reviewers could say that it was just ok.  That makes no sense to me at all.  If you can make a better mac at home, let me know, because I'm coming over for dinner.  But until someone takes me up on that offer, Sauce can shut up and take my money."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but unfortunately, it's not what it used to be.  Service is hit and miss.  Same with the food.  No longer in my list of go-tos, I'm sorry to say."}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers in town. Very thick patties so it takes a bit to cook. Love their mac & cheese and sweet potato fries.  Great happy hour specials as well."}
{"text":"Cool place in Bridgeville, love treating myself to lunch here. Always delicious and fresh. Staff very friendly and professional, make you feel welcome. Burgers juicy and tasty indeed. Salads crisp delish! When I checked in on fb, I was surprised at how many others knew of and enjoyed it too, being I'm a Pittsburgh girl!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice in the last week. My new favorite place!!!!!  The large selection of burgers to choose from is a challenge. I love that I can order them in a skillet with no bun(gluten free).  Their fries are fresh cut and super delicious. They also have great happy hour deals!!! I can't eat the Mac and cheese but it looks delish!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is unreal. The burgers were ok. No home made veggie burger which seems odd for a burger joint, and no draft beers."}
{"text":"A fun hole in the wall with a nice back dining area. Burgers, Mac and cheese, and desserts delicious. Great service and fun atmosphere. Also have late night drink specials!"}
{"text":"Let's just start with the fact that I took my Mom here a few months ago because I'm an amazing daughter, and she's been back 4 times since then. She, the notorious food-sender-backer and needer-of-everything-cooked-perfectly, loves it... and that says a lot about a small local burger joint.  Sitting on a corner intersection of Washington Ave, the humble location is overlooked once you enter the seemingly fun bar/restaurant area in the front. I say 'seemingly' because I was unfortunately seated in some kind of back room. The walls were white and plain and the tables were arranged totally randomly, except for the possibility they were meant to face a television which was broadcasting, I want to say... a baseball game? That  being said, just make sure to request front seating so you can chose to ignore sports however you can.  While there doesn't seem to be a lot to do in that area, it's a great local spot to invite your mom, grab a burger and a few beers, and accomplish your daughterly duties for the week while satisfying your need to stuff your face without shame."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Watched the blonde bartender taste!!! Someone's drink before serving it. They can't even make a Margarita properly. It was so sour and weak I ordered something else. Weak drinks, rude servers. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Affordable, melt-in-your-mouth burgers. The BBQ Kobe burger and side of mac & cheese was heavenly."}
{"text":"Food - very good Service - not so good.  Don't say the burgers will be done in15 minutes when its closer to 45."}
{"text":"Maybe you have to wait awhile for a table... a small one, back in the corner.  Maybe the service is rushed at times and the ambience barely beats a diner.  But, there are a few things that I can't overlook here: 1. Homemade Macaroni & Cheese... served warm in a cast iron skillet.  I'm a creamy but rich mac-n-cheese guy and their recipe did not disappoint.   2. Great Burger Combinations... like Wild Mushroom Bourbon or, my favorite, Pancetta Gorgonzola. 3. Good Beef... with an option to upgrade to Kobe at a reasonable $12.  Mine was big and juicy, falling apart at medium-rare. 4. Very Reasonable Prices... $8 for Burgers ($12 Kobe) includes a \"choice\" of side.  I put choice in air bunnies because once you try their mac-n-cheese, there is no question.   5. Decent Drink Selection... including craft brews on tap, specialty drinks, and wines good enough to please my semi-wine snobby friends. 6. Surprisingly Great Desserts... many served still warm in the skillet.  Definitely leave room for these gems - we had the chocolate chip cookies with ice cream."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place. Anytime I go anywhere near Pittsburgh, I go here. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. Hands down a place that you should try because they have Mac and cheese anyway you want it! Love their deep fried picked, their pretzel bites and their place is so cute. I've never had to wait to sit. Parking could be better but you def need a short walk to the lot after your meal. :)"}
{"text":"I ate here when this place first opened and it was fantastic. I had gone another time a few months back, and thought that the food and service had declined substantially. On a return trip for lunch today, I saw how far this place has truly fallen. Upon walking in, we were taken through the kitchen area to our table in the back. All three people in the kitchen were filthy looking. Upon entering our seating area, I was overwhelmed with how filthy it was. I didn't think it was possible to have chairs get this dirty.  The tables were also rather scuzzy looking.  Maybe people don't notice at night because it's poorly lit?  Anyway, we ordered drinks and when the waitress returned, she yelled at one of the children for playing with sugar packets saying \"we're not going to have that, how about some coloring pages?\" and grabbing the container out off her hands. She said \"kids rip them open and it's very expensive replacing them\" Between the filth and the rude server, we decided to get the check and go. I'll never return to this awful, filthy place again.  **UPDATE** Apparently I'm not the only one that thought this place was gross. You might want to check out the allegheny county health departments reports on this place as well. There are plenty of them."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great burgers, love the wing specials and the MAC N CHEESE is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great burger place. They make a lot of their food on cast iron skillets, like their amazing mac and cheese, also open faced burgers. We normally go here at least once a month, prices are reasonable, food is consistently good. Barbeque bacon cheeseburger is amazing here."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a few days ago, and saw the building was up for rent, and a \"CLOSED\" sign was on the door.  Not surprised, since the last few times I was here, the food and service were not as good as when they first opened up.  Hopefully something better moves into this spot."}
{"text":"Great burgers, wings, pulled pork nachos are great!! Awesome mac and cheese comes bubbling in a cast iron skillet! Deep fried hot dogs, need I say more?!"}
{"text":"We arrived for brunch around 10:30 on Sunday. The had around 10 items on their breakfast menu. The waitress immediately told us they were out of 2 of the items. We asked for another item, were told they were out of that.  We had coffee and I ordered the pancakes with fruit topping and were informed they were out of all of the toppings for pancakes. I then asked for the bill for the coffee and left."}
{"text":"No concept on how to run a restaurant.  Waited over an hour for food, without even an offer of something to start (like the home fries and toast that come with our order), while the staff walked back and forth past the table without a word on the delay.  We finally had to leave and never got our food, an apology, or an attempt at an explanation.   That's the second time we suffered awful service here, and will be the last."}
{"text":"This is a great casual place. Their burgers are delicious and they have several signature burgers. However, the Mac & cheese is amazing. You can get it as a side or entree. If you get the entree you can add in 3 toppings. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a variety of times.  For a small corner joint it has great ambience, excellent food and best of all has been very consistent, every time we've come.  The pancetta and blue cheese burger is simply sensational, as is the homemade mac 'n cheese.  Yum!  Thanks for never disappointing us!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed in Sauce! Seeing as macaroni and cheese is my absolute favorite food, I would rate them 5 stars time and time again. Their skillet Mac and cheese is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's certainly not health food and I even thought to myself this place would be perfect for when you have a killer hangover. All in all I found the service very good, the burgers were good (and offered some creative options, like subbing chicken or no bun options)...and yes the Mac n cheese is THAT good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been to Sauce several times and have yet to get bad or even ok service. We were there this past Saturday with our out of town guests. Got a table within 10-15 minutes. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The place was hopping but we received our food (5meals and drinks) within 20 min wait. I told them the food comes in large portions. They ate everything despite feeling really full because it was so good. They asked if we could go there again! Recommend going there to anyone! It is a little diner with a edgy feel, but that is part of the ambiance, LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the South Hills for a long time but never went here before. I decided to try it out during the pirate game for lunch and a few drinks. The service was great. Waitresses and bartenders were attentive but not pushy. I ordered the burger with bacon, bbq sauce, and cheese, and the macaroni and cheese. The mac n cheese, like everyone else described, is amazing. I finished the whole skillet. I was really disappointed by the burger. I ordered it medium and it was well done. It was tough, dry, didn't have enough sauce, and had a lot of gristle. I didn't expect this from a place that's known for it's burgers. I might go back for the other food but I won't be ordering a burger again."}
{"text":"Usually I'm a happy customer with positive experiences but lately Sauce has been dropping the ball!! My father and I had chicken pot pies and they tasted SOUR. We were in a rush for lunch - so we didn't order anything else or complain at the time. My past few experiences have been mediocre or terrible. Service and food quality is down."}
{"text":"Still load music, but we were seated in back room and music was not on there.  Good start.  We did have to wait for a table and hostess made sure we knew how long and was very helpful!  Had the Buffalo BBQ Burger, is suppose to have Buffalo BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Only had a dollop of BBQ sauce so basically one bit had the taste...that was it.  Ordered the burger medium it came out well...so tasteless..so overcooked.  Waitress brought Mac & cheese as a side, but I ordered the Sweet fries...she checked her slip and corrected immediately...good job!  Left the Mac & Cheese for us also (Oh So Good) Good Sweet Fries!  S had Build a Mac Skillet that was Oh So Good!  The MAC may be the best thing on the menu...Oh Yes I stole a few bites...more than a few.   Also had the Homemade Potato Chips and they were over cooked.  I like my chips crispy and cooked but this was overcooked/fried...to bad!  Oh yea, the burgers and MAC come in hot skillets that meal is cooked in.  If you go, get someone to order the MAC built your way!  Notice that they do do brunch on weekends."}
{"text":"Horrible service, back room open and open tables out front, Host would not seat two people at a booth. So we took our money elsewhere !"}
{"text":"I started going to Sauce when it first opened. I have never witnessed a restaurant go from 'great' to 'lost cause' in such a short amount of time. It is like the owner(s) just gave up caring. Food went from great to bad. Service went from cheerful to dour. Even my young kids noticed the change. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese is really good. It's kind of a build your own thing, and I had Mushrooms, chicken, and Swiss cheese on mine. The portions are huge, so expect to bring home some leftovers, even if you show up hungry. As noted in other reviews, it sometimes takes a little while to get the server's attention, but they've always been prompt after they realize you're there to eat and drink.  I meet a friend here every couple of weeks, we enjoy the happy hour, where they have several appetizers on half price."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday to get lunch and there was a consumer alert from the health department posted on the door."}
{"text":"First visit last night and was pleasantly surprised. Most impressed by the burgers - I had Pancetta Gorgonzola (no bun, in the skillet), wife had the A1 burger. Both correctly cooked to order and better meat quality than anything else in the area. Seasonal vegetable side dish was actually grilled, tasty and not overcooked. A rarity for sure. One bite of the mac & cheese (my wife is not on a diet like I am) was as good as it gets. All the negatives were similar to other reviewers. Wish they had draft beer. Will return for the burgers."}
{"text":"Has the best mac and cheese. Also burger in case iron skillet is very tasty. One of the best fried pickles with a spicy horseradish dipping sauce. Good drink special and beer selection. I rather had good food at a dive bar than crappy food at an overpriced upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"There isn't much I miss about living in the Scott Twp/Bridgeville area but now and again I do miss Sauce. They have some of the best burgers around and the mac & cheese is absurdly delicious."}
{"text":"Had a grilled shrimp wrap which was pretty tasty.  I saw several comments about slow and inattentive service, but I didn't experience that at all.  I sat at the bar and the bartender quickly took my drink and food order and the wait for it to arrive wasn't long either.  Overall, good experience and I liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times than I would have preferred - an unfortunate side effect of having in-laws who love the food here and live in very close proximity.   My first time here, I thought having your food cooked and served in a cast iron skillet was unique. Now that the novelty has worn off, it ends up just being a nuisance because there's never enough room on the tables once your food finally arrives. They have cut back on the number of entrees served in skillets, but still - there never seems to be enough room.  With that being said, the food itself is just mediocre. The California Dreamer sandwich is a charred, sloppy mess. The Saucelettes were underwhelming. My husband does enjoy their Buffalo BBQ burger, when it is cooked to temperature. I do admit that the mac and cheese tends to be one of the better items to order, but this last go around is lacked a bit of salt. Their buffalo chicken dip appetizer is good, but really, how can you go wrong with hot, bubbling, melted cheese, chicken and hot sauce?  Overall, if you end up coming here, you'll survive. It won't be the most memorable meal, but if you choose carefully, it won't be one you'll want to forget immediately either."}
{"text":"Umm. Pedestrian at best! No draft beer. That says a lot of the quality. Not much freshly done. The burger was very bland and the meat didn't taste fresh, nor was it juicy, just greasy. The Greek salad was strange. Iceberg lettuce, an artichoke heart, pimentos , feta and olives all plopped into a stale fried flour tortilla. Topped with bottled dressing. Not a good look! \"Soup of the day\" was $4. I'm quite sure it was Campbell's Chunky heated barely above room temp. Service was SLOW on a slow Saturday afternoon. Huge disappointment as I gave this place a 2nd chance. Not going for the strike out."}
