{"text":"I ate the \"Value Gyros Meal\" which consisted of a Gyros, fries and a fountain drink.. The fries were fresh and well done with no greasy taste.. the fountain drink was fine... but I came for the Gyros and what can I say.. the portion was ample but the meat was lacking in taste and a good gyro's got taste.. and as they say..\"the Chef is in the sauce\" and honestly the yogurt and cucumbers were barely discernible on the gyro.. Having lived in the area of Tarpon Springs, Florida for 25 years I ate a lot of good gyros and this was not one.. There are better ones in the Valley.."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!!  I had the gyros, then I could smell the kabobs.  I need to come back soon."}
{"text":"This place brings back many memories. Every time my family would go and get haircuts we would come here afterwards. This is the best place I have ever been to for gyro's. The family who owns it is very nice and are actually from Greece. The prices are very reasonable. This is my favorite place in the entire city to go for Greek food! Try them out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for the past 7 years.  Great food and very friendly staff. Owner owned and operated.  They will not go cheap on you."}
{"text":"I've been to Greek restaurants all over the world and nothing compares to their tzatziki sauce. 

Authentic Greek food run by a Greek family in a small and unassuming location."}
{"text":"Stopped in and tried the gyro meal with fries. The gyro came with onions, tomatoes and dill sauce all of which was very good. Fries were good as well. Tried the baklava which I'd never had before and really liked that as well. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My salad was huge and the gyro meat on it was cooked to perfection! My husband said his gyro sandwich was the best he has had In Phoenix, and liked how much meat came on his sandwich.You can tell this mom n pop place cooks from the heart! The sauce is delicious and the olive oil tastes like no other OO I've ever had. The restaurant is very clean, and VERY nice staff! This now is our new favorite place to eat! TRY IT...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill so I decided to stop by this joint for lunch. Not a bad decision! their Falafel pita was delicious. I felt like a dine-in order would deserve better than a styrofoam plate and they certainly skimped on the fries on this occasion but the falafel was well cooked and the sandwich had a lot of fresh/pickled veggies included. The tzatziki sauce was delicious but kinda ran down the sandwich making the first bites dry and the latter ones a bit runny but overall I would recommend this place and I'm definitely gonna try it out again in the future."}
{"text":"This place has the worst greek food I've ever tasted. The meat was nasty and tasted like spam, the rice tasted like rice-a-roni, and the sauce was just gross. On the positive side, the lettuce was green and was as expected. Seriously, the only thing they got right was the lettuce.

Do yourself a favor and try another place for greek food."}
{"text":"The prices, selection, service and food are great. If you're into American-Greek food, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"The owners are VERY nice. Food is fresh and the size of the gyro is LARGE a GREAT place"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Glendale! I came here as a first timer and couldn't be more satisfied! The lady at the counter who owns the place with her husband was so friendly and talked to me the whole time I was waiting for my food. We were discussing the difference between their mom and pop shop compared to other Greek restaraunts. She explained to me that they make all their food themselves, nothing frozen or processed. She gave me a whole container of their hummus for free just to show me how much better it was than other places. They make it fresh every 2 hours or so and it is soooo yummy! Their Chicken Gyro Salad is to DIE FOR!!!!! Definitely my new place for Gyros!"}
{"text":"I have to say good greek food is hard to find their souvlaki and their gyro platters are the way to go!  The lady who runs the shop is super nice and she says they are a chicago style greek place.  I have not had greek food in Chi-town but having worked in greek diners, bakeries etc. They hold it down over here.  I usually order to go but they have a small seating area go enjoy this diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Good people at this place, family operated. Very good food at a great price! I had a combo plate with chicken and I am sure falafel. I prefer Mediterranean food prepared the Arabic(Lebanese) way but, this place was good too."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal.  I had the chicken pita combo and it just melts in your mouth and the prices are amazing.  I'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I have loved king gyros since I was a kid! These are the best gyros in arizona! It's family owned and they a r E amazing people. I guarantee the gyro platter (2 gyros, fries, and salad) it's 10 dollars but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I have always been surprised/dismayed as to how difficult it is to find good greek food in Phoenix. 

Well, here you go. I will admit that I am a bit of a Gyro junkie and have not tried anything else on the menu, but this is my go-to place for greek food. I have been known to drive 20 minutes out of my way just to pick up a gyro from this place.

Great Food - Friendly Staff - Clean = What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Had them for the first time today I'm from Chicago originally and it's been hard finding a Gyro place in Arizona worth yelping about. But very good food portions sauce and tax is included. I will definitely go back very good food. And very nice staff the gyro plate can feed two people and it's under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 25 mins for a chicken pita while the owners stare at you while eating their own food this is you spot. I will never come here again and tell everyone of the bad service."}
{"text":"The gyro plate is the best in the valley. Flavorful and filling, I always get an extra pita. I order the plate., no fries extra salad. Yum. Staff always friendly. Location small but clean. Tables outside to enjoy great weather.
Family pride shines through. Love their food and their passion."}
{"text":"If you have never had Greek food before then this might pass as decent. There are so many better options when it comes to Greek restaurants that only a few miles from here and are worth the money. 

My husband order the Chicken Pita. The chicken was spongy as if had been sitting in a bucket of water. 

My toddler and I shared the chicken kabob plate. The rice was extremely salty and tasted like Top Ramen rice. The chicken tasted old and was greasy. 

We all shared an order of hummus, which was bland and was drowning in oil that created a less than desirable after taste. 

I am glad this was not our first experience tasting Greek Food because it would have been our last. As for now we will stick to our fav. place down the street from here. 

To end with a positive note, the salad veggies did taste fresh."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times now. The first time I went, the lady behind the counter talked to us and told us about the different dishes. She offered a generous sample of the gyro meat with the tzatki (sp) sauce. I never liked lamb, but this was very tasty! My family has ordered assorted dishes, of the assorted meat plate with rice and veggies, soulvaki, pork pita, steak sandwhich/pita,and I had the chicken pita and the chicken salad. The food here is fresh and home made. I love the sauce and always end up getting extra. The bread is wonderful and I would order a second pita for an extra .70 cents! All the meat was perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious. The vegetables were fresh and no sign of browing. The place is a casual atmosphere and clean. I learned the lady's name is Oiudad and although she seems stern, she is very nice, the more she gets to know you she warms up. By the end of our last visit, my 26 yr old stepson gave her a big hug.
We tried the home made baklava and it is out of this world delicious! This will be a spot we will return to over and over. They even have chicken nuggets, pasta, and hamburgers for the not so adventurous or kidlets to please everyone. I do wish they would get some brewed iced tea to add on the drink menu. That would be the only thing I would change.  But I can overlook that for this gem!"}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Good value for the money.  Family owned and operated.  It's our favorite place to go."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant when I want to eat out. Delicious food! large portions! Reasonable prices! And it's just icing on the cake that it is locally owned by a lovey family who runs the restaurant themselves and remembers our favorite order every time we come in. As a matter of fact, we were recently out of the area for almost a year, but when we came back they still remembered!"}
{"text":"Tasty, delicious, yummy, cheap ... I'm sold! Everything I tried was good, place is always packed, people are nice, what else do you need! I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been coming since I was 16 years old and I'm now I'm 31! 15 years of amazing food! I'm native but now live in another state. Every trip home I always stop in for the best gyros I've ever eaten. I only wish they could come home with me because I would be in heaven but probably broke!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu rocks.Chicken kabob plate = amazing! The food here is fantastic. Mom and pop place. The wife is ringing up orders while the husband is kicking out dishes on the fly. Been coming here for years, never a dull meal."}
{"text":"This place has answered my prayers.  Just when I thought I couldn't find a really good, inexpensive middle eastern place, my friend brought me here.

1.  Really good, really fresh pita bread
2.  Awesome salad, very fresh and tasty.
3.  Great tzatziki, and I'm very picky
4.  Loved the gyros and chicken equally

Plus the people working there are super nice and friendly!
I will be back often!"}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed with the Gyro salad...will definitely come back and try other food selections..."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, I could probably eat here every day. Everything I've ever ordered has been amazing, from gyros and Greek salads to catfish and steak sandwiches, I've never had anything that's been less than amazing."}
{"text":"I like this laid back gyro place! I ordered the gyro combo, it came with a gyro sandwhich, fries and a soda. It was reasonably priced at $6.75. My boyfriend ordered the gyro plate. It came with a huge salad and it was $8.60 which did not include a soda. I enjoyed this gyro restaurant and will visit again! :)"}
{"text":"I have to agree w/ Becky S and Adam K....REALLY Good Middle Eastern food, good prices- nice staff! All-around winner!! best deal- 6.99 Gyro plate; giant gyro, fries and a drink!!! ..What more can you ask for.. (maybe a bigger sitting area!!)"}
{"text":"King Gyros is the best. Food cooked to order so it may take a few minutes,but we have been dining here for years. Always fresh food, always friendly, and always clean ! I eat Greek no where else. I support Family owned, they try harder and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Its a bit small and does get crowded at certain times, but the service is very good and the food comes out quickly. speaking of the food, its great! and is reasonably priced. I love to get the gyro platter here, its so good! and very filling! So if your hungry for gyros definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Large portions. Great flavors. Smells nice. Always busy & great customer service. Always come back when I'm in the area. Best place for chicken Greek salad!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite greek place! My wife brought me here 6 yrs ago and ever since then I come back every time I'm in Phoenix. The owner Benny and his wife are like family. They always greet us with hugs and kisses, happy to have a place where all I have to say is I want the \"usual\" and she knows it means the beef kabob plate which btw is amazing.  The gyros are the best I've  ever had. Love this place! Highly recommend this awesome joint!"}
{"text":"I have been going to King Gyros for about seven years now. 

The owner's wife is very nice to my two children, and remembers what they like (and what we like) when we walk in the door. I've never encountered something on the menu i did not like. 

My wife regularly has the chicken pita I tend to gravitate to the the gyros plate, served with a salad while the kids have the chicken nuggets. 

Portions are great. 

When family comes in from out of town, it is a must have on their list as well. 

To be honest, I pass 3 other pita places on the way there and never think twice about going to the other places."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gyro place. The service is exceptional and friendly and the food is AMAZING! I usually go with a steak or chicken pita and it is consistently the best!!"}
{"text":"If you like your gyros full of meat and not lost under a salad, then this place is for you!

This is the real deal, the gyro meat is tender and full of spices, and cut fresh from the spit to order.  Not the reheated or grilled meatloaf some places try to pass off as gyro meat.  The pitas are warm and are more than able to keep the abundance of ingredients in check.  The tzatziki sauce is a bit runny but with lots of dill...Restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly.

I have been coming here for years, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"A ma and pa shop that shows a lot TLC to the quality of their food. A safe/excellent choice for Mediterranean style food. Plus, the staff was super good looking and excessively friendly!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have really good gyros but I must admit my favorite plate to get here is the chicken kabob plate. My husband always gets the Combo plate. So good! This isn't exactly the closest to my house but we'll worth the drive. I can most definitely say I will be a continuing customer."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Our go-to place for a quick yummy dinner. Enjoy the family owned business -- always so friendly and timely. When you place a phone order, it's usually \"10-12-minutes\"...! 
The chicken gyro is so flavorful -- would love to know how it's cooked as I can never replicate it."}
{"text":"By far BEST gyros in AZ!!!! There may be one better out there, but I've had them from Flagstaff to Tucson. From Quartzite to Globe and I have yet to find one that can match the flavor, freshness and awesomeness of King Gyro. They pack their gyros with meat.....not tomatoes, lettuce (seriously people? Lettuce!?) Or other fillers. Their tzatziki is very good....not too heavy and not too light. The service is always friendly and the place is clean and tidy.
This place is definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places for gyros in phx. Great customer service- the staff is always super nice and the food is always good. I usually order it for takeout and I've never had to wait long for my food to be ready."}
{"text":"Can't beat the service and personal attention from the lovely owner! We tried this place for the first time last week, and came back first chance. 

The FALAFEL is just perfect. The best I've ever had! 

Great food, fast service, and an enjoyable atmosphere. We will keep coming back often. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Went to phx to do some shopping and on the way back to Tucson came across this little joint, let me jus say WOW!! Walked in and was immediately greeted and the food is wonderful! They def got this right!! Keep up the good work! Staff is awesome! I'll most def be back on my next trip to phx!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today and so pleased that I did! Enjoyed one of the best Gyro sandwiches I have had!  Everything tastes very fresh and the sauce is amazing! Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Next to my dentist and always wanted to check it out.   Glad I did.  Great food and people.   I had the chicken pita and a salad.  Outstanding !!!!! I need to got to the dentist more often...."}
{"text":"Great food and staff, one of the better Gyros places in the valley! Good portion sizes and authentic Greek food, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place for gyros in town. We travel thirty minutes for lunch just to eat here. Try the number 8 gyro plate with fries."}
{"text":"Have been here twice so far and both times, food and service were excellent. Chicken pita sandwich (comes with fries) and the gyros plate (comes with salad, bread, and fries) are amazing. Their plates are very, very filling so you'll have enough to take to go if you'd like. Small and quaint place with a friendly atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Greatest gyros in town! 

Paul C. and myself tried one of the more expensive, fancier, Rep rated trend joints and there was no comparison. 

What they lack in atmosphere they make up for with delicious food and great service! 

One time I spilled tzaziki sauce on my shoe and nearly ate it without thinking...that's how good the stuff is. 

They would be the perfect sunday lunch place if only they were open on Sunday."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Greek place to eat for almost, wow, 12 years now. I first have to start with the great customer service I get every time I go there. I have brought friends and family here because of it (plus the food of course), and I get asked every time I go about how they are doing or about how my life is going. She remembers great details about her customers, and now-a-days that's a rare find. She knows exactly what I am going to order (Yes, I'm predictable) and has it already written on a ticket before I'm at the counter. Just amazing personable service. 

Now to the food, which is just as amazing. If you enjoy a classic gyro, that's what got me hooked in the first place. The Tzatziki Sauce is flavorful, and sauce like, not thick, and has been the best I have tasted. I love getting an extra side and dipping my fries in it or pouring it on my rice. If you want to try something a little different get my favorite which is the steak pita. The steak is marinated in some delicious concoction,  and its won me for good. They have plenty of other options for people who aren't adventurous in the food category, like hamburgers and what-not, but I haven't had them. I would only imagine they are tastey if that's what you are going for ;)"}
{"text":"Great food! Hard to find a place to sit in the small dining area during busy times, but otherwise pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food. I'm from Boston and this place stacks up with Gyros from the north. Nice people, the place is clean, and open kitchen."}
{"text":"Was a great place to eat, now food is greasy, and it doesn't taste like it used to. Used to have a more of a homemade taste, now tastes like Costco business center. Sad. I loved going here."}
{"text":"Even though I've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus, I highly recommend this little greek hot spot. They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back. The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however, so I always order 2-3 extra). I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great. I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food. 

The staff is completely Greek. They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind. Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food."}
{"text":"Being from Chi-Town and living in AZ since '01 I've had my share of Greek food and must say that King Gyros is not only authentic, it's REALLY AUTHENTIC! Had the Combo with Kiftka, Gyros meat, and Chicken... All three were delicious, served warm, moist and seasoned properly... My taste buds were screaming MORE! 

My wife told me to slow down because I must have been shoveling every forkful into my kisser... But how can you stop or slow down on this food? YOU CAN'T!!! The chicken broth infused basmati rice,salad,and pita with side of tzatziki sauce were also great. 

The owners made you feel like you are welcomed in their home(restaurant)... If you like or love Greek or Mediterranean food this is a must... You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Gyro place in Arizona. Quick service as well. We've never been to Greece but after eating here, we feel like we've been there! Real family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! 
I got the Mediterranean salad with chicken, a pita bread . Tziziki sauce came with it.  It was wonderful.  The owner was so friendly, she knew it was my first visit and made sure I was happy with every thing.  The chicken was perfect, tender and juicy.  If i'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I love King Gyros!!!  It's sooo delicious. Their chicken is perfectly flavored and the rice is amazing:). The staff is super friendly and I love supporting small /local restaurants.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!!"}
{"text":"As the number of check-ins I have shows, i eat here a lot. And I never get bored of it! 

The owners are super friendly, and they are always genuinely glad to see you when you walk in. 

The Gyros are probably 2nd in the valley only to Haji-Baba in my opinion, but they are far from the best trick up the sleeve here!

Try the shish-kabob. Trust me, you won't regret it! Also, the souvlaki is amazing, and the dolmas are delicious!

Personally I get a gyro salad to go on my way home from the gym 9/10 times I come, but i also try to change it up and I've yet to come across something on their menu that wasn't delicious!"}
{"text":"I went on a vacation to Arizona from Chicago and was told king gyros had great food. The food wasn't great it was beyond fantastic i don't know where to start. I kept on ordering out when I was there for 2 weeks and this is the only restaurant I would ever fly out for it I became a millionaire. Great family owned business and fantastic food."}
{"text":"I dropped by King Gyros after reading the raving reviews about this place. Now I know why! Their gyros are delicious and super cheap. It's kind of a hole in the wall place, but that made me even more fond of it. The staff was very friendly. I wish I lived closer to this place - it would definitely become one of my regular joints!"}
{"text":"Best food and BEST service. The owner is very friendly and you feel like you have known here for years. LOVE LOVE the food too!!"}
{"text":"Greek mafiosos aside, I find King Gyros to be a good cheap lunch grub type of place.  

It's a counter style lunch joint (wedged in the Mervyn's shopping center) with tacky Greek beach posters on the wall, classroom carpet, corian tables and cedar chairs. 

I come here quite often and usually order a chicken gyro plate with fries or the greek salad, and they're both tasty, cheap and does the job.  In particular I like the gyro sauce with its yogurt sauce, spices and fresh dill.  

King Gyros is not exactly a standout type of place, but I find it to be a solid choice if you're in the area.

It can get busy during the day, but last time I was here Nico and Demetri rolled up with their entourage in their club clothes and a pricey Mercedes at 2 PM.  Klassy!"}
{"text":"Delicious falafel with tons of veggies! It was so big! Falafel and fries $6.45 with only a 6-8 minute wait. Pretty amazing."}
{"text":"The King is king for a reason. They have the best gyros. Period. I've had gyros all over the world and this place is my favorite."}
{"text":"Use to go here 5 years ago when we used to live close by. Yesterday we drove there ,to see if they still as good as I remembered. It was still very good food. The owner ( I believe) is always friendly and the chicken pita is very moist & taste great. I also like that the gyro meat isn't so dry as in most places, to where you need a bunch of extra sauce to get it down!"}
{"text":"First time visit to this family owned business. Im so disappointed.. in the fact that I've lived in the area for so long..and never tried this amazing place. They have been in business for over 17 years... and there is a reason why. It's absolutely the best gyros I've ever had. I feel as if I've been cheated by every other Greek place in town. The gyros original is $6.75.. and I could only finish half. The owners were so nice. So full of life. So happy. So proud. And they have every reason to be."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan.... Huge portions,,, great, family owned nice people, great humus, falafel, gyros, good prices...Its all good!!! did I mention GIANT Gyros :)"}
{"text":"Favorite Greek ever! Been going here for years because I can't stop the cravings for this place. Chicken kabob plate with pita and the Greek salad is perfect. The sauce too..."}
{"text":"Really good! Was surprised. Small hole in the wall restaurant with few tables but worth it. Super friendly staff and yummy food."}
{"text":"Just found our new Go To place. Super yummy! Plenty of food on plate. Friendly service. Clean. Nice and cool. Baklava was delish!!! 5 of us went, each ordered something  different, chicken, pork, sauceage,ravioli and qyros. Salad was fresh and super good."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We use to go there all the time when we lived over that way. Just went there after about a year away and the food is still great. Hummus with Greek pitas are the best around."}
{"text":"Just came from this mom and pop restaurant. Unbelievable! We've tried several highly rated Mediterranean restaurants throughout the valley and this has surpassed them by far. The woman who owned it was so sweet, a Grecian grandma who cared about us. The gyro platter was sooooo addictive. The meat was juicy, tender, and seasoned perfectly and the tzasiki was amazing- complemented the meat beautifully. The pitas were warm and fresh- best I've had. The hummus was oh so garlicky. Smooth and perfectly made. Kids had some yummy hot dogs with fries made fresh. Go here- you will not regret it. We can't wait to try the rest of their extensive menu!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Greek fan, probably because I don't like lamb gyros or pitas or whatever they want to call it. 

But today I went in just get a chicken pita. I thought it would be like any other chicken pita but i was wrong. The chicken was very moist and the flavor was damn good. There sauce actually had good flavor to it since other places I've had we're very bland. 

My friend got the chicken kabob plate, which for 8.99 was HUGE. He got a salad then a huge thing of rice, huge chunks of chicken and some toasted pita bread. Well worth it, this thing could probably feed 2 people. 

The rice they have is great and the pitas were not over cooked/toasted. 

The only draw back is during lunch it can get cramped in there and the Pepsi seemed alittle sweeter than it should be. But those are very small problems. 

I would come back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One of the better assembled greek Chicken Pita's I have had in awhile. All the usual suspects were involved, but the chicken was spiced and sliced perfectly and tucked into a pita wrap with good dill sauce, lettuce and other veggies. The pita came with hot fries and was served by the nice female owner of the place. This was a random stop while working one day in the area. This is the only time I feel bad a restaurant is not a chain because it is far from East valley. It only costs seven bucks too and most patrons were talking greek, so you knew you were eating in the right place."}
{"text":"Had a Dr appointment  close by so I decided to drop in for lunch.  The chicken pita is amazing ! So moist and the veggies are so fresh.  The owner was welcoming and offered suggestions. I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"King gyros is great. I stopped in last week and had a wonderful experience. This place truly lived up to the hype. I am extremely particular with my gyros and this did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Don't let its unassuming strip-mail location throw you off: this is one of the better places to eat in Phoenix. Everything is extremely fresh and very tasty. The Greek salads (with or without meat) are wonderful. Fresh sauces, lemon juice, and juicy tomatoes are at odds with the styrofoam plates and plastic utensils.  The colorful and friendly personalities of the staff are right out of a Seinfeld episode. The owner and his wife are frequently interacting with the customers to make sure that your meal is satisfying to you palate. Home cooking and conviviality are the trademarks of this diamond in the ruff."}
{"text":"This family-owned restaurant is so awesome. The service is very personal, and the food makes me crave and come back for more! I almost always get the Gyro salad. It's FABULOUS! They never get my order wrong and they even memorize it. They are on point. 

King Gyros is just, perfect."}
{"text":"King Gyros was decent, though everything seemed a bit on the oily side.  Had a gyro with good tzatziki, hummus which was okay, and onion rings :)
I suppose it's all about expectations, being a Chicago gal I will fully admit a high standard when it comes to gyros.  Since there are better gyro places within a short drive of here I likely won't return to King-Chicago Gyros is still my fave with JT's a close second."}
{"text":"Super great food especially the rice and grilled chicken. So much flavor and tastes very authentic. I love this place and highly recommend if you are in the area. The place is small and tucked in a strip mall but don't let that detour you it is worth trying and enjoying some great eats. Staff is friendly and remembers me everything I go there."}
{"text":"I have only the regular gyro but it was really good and a really good price for a quick lunch break from the office."}
{"text":"I just put a review in here for this place and now I need to add an update. Do not go here, they are unprofessional and rude. I called them today around noon to find out when they close being Christmas eve. I was told 4pm so I planned to be there around 3:30 to pick up some gyro sandwiches for myself and my mother. I arrived at 20 minutes till and parked in front. When I stepped out of the car the owner stepped out and said they were closed. This to me is not the way to run a business. I said it was not 4pm yet and he didn't say much then just walked back in the store. Damn rude if you ask me. Puts me off from going back to
this place and I will not recommend it to anyone. Makes me wonder if the lost business was worth going home 20 minutes early.

\"Update\" I went in to King Gyros a few days ago mostly because my mother loves the meat here. Right when I walked in The owner in the back started yelling at the women behind the counter. I was thinking he must read yelp and realized I was the one who gave him a bad review. Turns out he was telling the woman to give me a free gyro because they were closed when I arrived on Christmas eve. He told me he remembered me and apologized for being closed. I would say they redeemed themselves in spades. I now will recommend them and go back."}
{"text":"Not a big gyro fan so when this was recommended to me, I was a bit weary. I still haven't tried the gyros but it's no matter, what they call Greek spaghetti was better than what you may get at an Italian restaurant!

It tastes fresh with Roma tomatoes and the sauce is very lightly applied, but it's a good thing: trust me. The portion is huge! Then the garlic bread is the perfect amount to really sop up what's left over.

End the meal with some baklava and mm, perfect meal! 

Plus it seems to be family owned. I don't eat there often but I'm still recognized every time I come in. Service is excellent, everyone is very nice - even when they are very busy and the restaurant is filled up!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is one of the best Gyro's I have ever had. I get the Gyro platter which provides you with a lot of meat. I have not had a bad experience here yet. My wife even likes their cheese burgers."}
{"text":"Best Gyros restaurant in town. Place is very clean along with friendly staff. Been coming here for years,can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for gyros! We've tried about quite a few in the area and this is the best.  Gyros come with a ton of meat, I always ask for an extra side of tazitki sauce bc it's delicious."}
{"text":"The woman who took my order is the owner (I assume) and she is so friendly. The gyro plate is hands down the best deal here. Lots of meat salad and pita bread!This place very clean and a great place for authentic Greek cuisine!"}
{"text":"Looking for great gyros in a family run joint.  You found it.

Great Gyros, nice fresh warm pita, a more dilly taziki (sp?) sause.

I had the Gyros platter, that included a greek salad.  it was wonderful  

Fries are nothing to write home about.

Baklava was ok.

I am a fan and I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to King Gyros for over a decade now.  It is hands down the best Greek Food I have ever had.  The Gyro meat is fantastic.  I tend to like mine a little over done.  They know that, and never miss getting it right.  The hummus is the best in Phoenix, the tzatziki sauce is insane.  The restaurant is always spotless.  Best of all are the owners and staff.  This restaurant is clearly their passion and they are so attentive to their customers.  In fact, after getting divorced, they asked my interest in another very cute customer.  She said she would put in a good word for me if interested.  What other restaurant does that?  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The best chicken Greek salad ever!! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend... Come here for lunch when we have training!! They always give us extra feta, they are always nice and friendly and always busy but fast service!!"}
{"text":"The freshest salad you'll find in this area. Small family owned business. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Really they want to charge a $1.50 more to Substitute French Frys for a salad REALLY! 
It costs them more for Frys  then it does for lettuce and Tomato.
Every other Gyros place I've been to will substitute. NO LIE!
  
Good : they give a lot if gyros meat on gyros.
Bad: it lacks tzatziki sauce and it's very oily
Not impressed."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean place. The food is good but nothing to rave home about. I had the gyro sandwich combo. Fries were definitely good. But i would say Shako Mako on Olive and 59th is a whole lot better."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here, and I was not disappointed.  It is not a huge space but the food is top notch. The lady, I believe is an owner is adorable.  I loved that as customers walked in, she said do you want your usual. Not just one person, like 10. She knew them and what they wanted. That is Customer Service! Had the gyro plate, came with a salad and fries. The salad was huge, and the fries were good. Their pita bread was delicious, I even bought more to take home. However the best thing about this place is the gyro meat. Omg it was moist and the flavor was wonderful.  
I have went to many gyro places around the NW Metro Phoenix  area. This is by far the Best of them all. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"Been going here for years! That's how good the food is! The place is clean and they have an A+ rating, up-to-date,displayed on the wall, which is something you see in Californian, not Az!"}
{"text":"We are back here again!  Just had to have this and try something different.  Going for the Chicken Kabobs and Shish Kabobs! Always awesome and this is no different.  Its so family like..love the service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Our family loved it and is the best in Arizona in our opinion. Five star all the way with no hesitation!!"}
{"text":"Got the original gryo, and must say it was quite tasty!  Onions, tomatoes, tzatziki sauce and plenty on gryo meat! I like authentic places and this seems fit the bill. Only been there once, but already know I will be back to get the original gyro again as well as try other items!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancee for lunch and it was mind blowing, amazingly good food. Service was fast and friendly even though it was a busy lunch time. The owner was so sweet and remembered my fiancee from previous visits and took the time to chat. We definetly will stop back in anytime we are in the area. Highly recommend you check this gem out."}
{"text":"We never go anywhere but here!! The best place , nice staff...the restaurant is small and in the summer a little hot so get it to go..."}
{"text":"This place rocks I'm visiting from Chicago and have been spoiled with delicious food came to King Gyro turns out the owner is originally from Chicago and I was very impressed with the food and customer service best gyro in town awesome sauce!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried them all and this is the best Gyro in all of Phoenix.  Big, meaty portions, Tzatziki Sauce made w/ Greek yogurt~not sour cream.  This is a family~owned restaurant.  My wife and I have been coming here for years & will continue to as well."}
{"text":"Best gyro place in town. Family owned with the owners homemade baklava. If you are coming here and it is close to closing. Call them and they will do the order over the phone so you won't miss out. Tons of meat and the sauce is the best. You have to get an order of baklava. The perfect flakey crunch but still moist with honey. It's addicting. You are warned."}
{"text":"Best Gyro place hands down! The gyro meat is perfect. And you get a lot. All veggies are fresh too. The prices are very fair. 
I usually go with my brother for lunch and we always order the gyro salad. Well the owner lady now remembers us and just asks \"the usual?\", we laugh and say \"yes please\". 
Also don't forget to wave at the guys in the kitchen. They seem always in a great mood! Always smiling, or maybe they just think I'm cute? lol. Either way you can't go wrong with King Gyro, great food and great people!"}
{"text":"Where to start???

The owners are very kind... say hi to Benny in the kitchen!!!

My wife and I found this place while living in the culinary-void NW Valley of Phoenix, and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3-year period.  Everything is good:

Gryos
Chicken Pita
Souvlaki
Greek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten
Fries are always fresh
Zatsiki sauce is stellar

The atmosphere is a bit void, but people don't come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere...  they come for great food at a great price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Phoenix. Growing up in Chicago, it was hard for me to find a Greek spot that I really enjoyed, but have found exactly what I was looking for at King Gyros. The owners are always so kind, and welcoming, and there is always just a great atmosphere every time I stop by. Most people can not taste the difference with Gyros, but I have to say they have the best Gyro meat. Their tzatziki sauce is probably one of my favorite things about the place. It just makes everything better! Their Chicken Pita sandwich is also always amazing. Their spices and ingredients are what makes their restaurant stand out. I will continue to come to king gyros while I live in Phoenix at least once a week. Go and try it out for yourselves, I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect! I will come here every chance. I order the chicken Caesar salad, wow! Everytime I go all are happy."}
{"text":"Great little place here. Got two meals with frys and chicken gyros with a drink for about 15 dollars even. Great food. Sauce is great tasting. The chicken is to die for. Fresh vegetables. The staff is hardworking and family operated.. amazing place. Pretty quick service too. Be warned it can be busy at peak lunch times. Call ahead and order to go ;)"}
{"text":"When it comes to Greek Food there is a hierarchy:

- Authentic Greek food that is made in the Mediterranean and you immerse yourself in the culture by assisting in the slaughter of the lamb yourself.
- Chicago style Greek food where your meal has been touched by every member of the Greek family that owns the restaurant.
- King Gyros
- Places that try to be King Gyros
- You at home, throwing shit that could go into a gyro into a tortilla (because you think they are the same,) but oddly now it looks like a burrito... 

Reasons King Gyros gets 4 stars from me:

+ It's close to my house and my job.
+ For the quality and quantity of food you get the price is excellent.
+ The service is fast and friendly.
+ They have amazing dishes other that just gyros!
-  The dolmades were not that hot... I have had fresh dolmades and also those from a can and these... I suspect were from a can. I can't confirm that, but I have a high suspicion..."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and you get a lot for your money! The lady at the cash register was really nice and considerate. I didn't know you had to buy sauce on the side and she was willing to give me some for free! I ended up buying 4 (so worth it). There tzatziki sauce is the best I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it has always been and always will be the best Gyros you will ever find. I've tried other place's gyros and nothing will ever beat the King Gyros.

I love the atmosphere in this,while small, very charming place. I usually get my food to go but I wouldn't mind hanging out at King Gyros while I enjoy the masterfully crafted Gyros."}
{"text":"Best Greek in town.   We always get the chicken Greek salad.   Best salad I have ever had.   We go almost every weekend.  We found this hidden gem by accident."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome, I'm so glad I have discovered Yelp so I can brag a bit about it for all they do. All of the food is great and made fresh, pita bread is nice and warm and the chicken salad is amazing! It's all family owned and operated and has been that way since forever, my aunt first found the place before our whole family started coming here and the lady to this day asks me how everyone is doing every time me and my wife walk in. Trust me this place is so good that it's what I brought my wife home for Valentine's day this year and she was happy I did. Always hits the spot and is way better for you then any fast good restaurant, now I need to check out the Desert Swirl in the same parking lot, I'll make sure to let everyone know my thoughts!"}
{"text":"Wow, so good Mom and I ate  take out twice this week for lunch !!!  The Gyros were done  very well, ready for pick up and the salads are tasty. Their bread is great  even eaten alone ."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to come for a gyro. The owner is a total sweetheart and already knows my order when I come in. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The first place I've ever tried Greek food was Pita Jungle and I've been hooked ever since. However I have found that the mom and pop places can be a hit or miss. King Gyro's is a HIT .  I have had their tabouli, hummus, dolmas, chicken gyro, and fajita pita and never once have I been dissappointed.  NATHAN S was not exaggerating about the tzaziki sauce I eat it with EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in town, really!  I have been eating here for years.  We have tried many other gyro places, nothing is as good or a better value for the money!  

The owners are great...they remember you and treat you like family if you go enough.  I love \"mom and pop\" eateries and this is one of the valleys best!

Prices are great, food is authentic greek!   The hummus is the best I have had... 

Small place with 10 small tables in a strip mall location.  Go off lunch hours or expect to wait in line.  Early dinner we never wait!"}
{"text":"This place is good!!!

Made to order and authentic. 

Greek chicken salad and hummus are a must try!"}
{"text":"OMG its good ! Lets be completely honest, I am as easy to please as I am to rub the wrong way and in the over a dozen times I have been here the food has just been excellent. The people are friendly, and super nice, the service is wonderful. 

Love it  !"}
{"text":"The ambiance is alright. It's a strip mall gyro shop. Nothing special about it.
The staff exists, takes your order, and will even bring it to you, but they fail to make that little bit of connection. 

That's not really true though, it's more that they don't try.

They take your order, they make your food, and bring it to you though, they're not rude or mean or anything of that sort. Just bored, and for some reason I found their indifference extremely off putting.

The food is good. Middle of the road. Just a gyro pita should be. The meat tastes good. It's sliced well. There's not a lot of it, so value suffers, but that's alright. The pita is somewhat dry, but again, not bad. It tastes fine, just not as soft and fluffy as I hoped. The fries are good and they serve a lot of them.

If I'm nearby, I'll go here. But I won't go out of my way, and it's definitely not a must have. DON'T AVOID THIS PLACE, it's perfectly fine. but that's all it is"}
{"text":"Gyros=Yee Row

I was looking for a lunch alternative and happened on to King Gyros in Phoenix, located in a strip mall. From the outside King Gyro doesn't look like much, and you need to park around the corner in the strip mall parking lot. However, the inside of King Gyro is very clean, well kept, and inviting. 

 I'm a huge Gyro fan and insist the word is  pronounced Yee Row. On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered a Steak Gyro and Chicken Cesar Salad, and both entrée's were delicious. 

The Steak Gyro was huge and filled with meat, this Gyro was big enough to feed two. The sauce was perfect, not too tart and the bread was fresh, warm and delicious. The Chicken Cesar Salad was also very good.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing flavorful.

I would go back there everyday if I lived in that area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic, Greek, family owned experience....this is it!! The food is delicious, the hummus is made fresh daily, the tatziki sauce is soooo good. The owners are some of the nicest people, it literally feels like you're sitting down in their home eating at their table.  I was never a Greek food person until my husband introduced me to this place....he's been going there for about 20-25 years! 

My favorite dish is the chicken kabob plate which comes with a Greek side salad and Greek rice. I can never finish the whole thing, so I always look forward to my leftovers :) My husband love the Gyro plate, which is equally delicious. They have a pretty bug menu, so I'm sure you will find what you are craving. 

They also have homemade baklava for my sweet tooth....so mouthwatering. 

They are closed on Sundays , which I always forget!! But I completely respect it."}
{"text":"Well that was unexpected.
The steak in the steak gyro was thick, tender chunks, perfectly seasoned and a generous portion. Place seemed pretty busy at 2 pm after the lunch rush, it sounded like many regulars. The woman at the front counter, maybe an owner, was very pleasant. I can't wait to back to try another thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, large portions. This is by far the best Greek food I've ever had! It's a family run business and they are very sweet, makes me feel like I'm at home. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"By far the best Gyro place in town. Great customer service, and most of all, the food is amazing. Their tztaki sauce is unbeatable, and I would definitely recommend the Chicken Pita for anyone who goes. Easy 5/5, recommended to all family and friends."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place frequently for about 5+ years now. The Pork Slouvaki plate or the Pork Pita never disappoints me. My best friend loves their hamburger (big!). I will say the fries portion is not usually a large quantity, but the main course more than enough fills me up. I keep saying I'm going to try the chicken kebab plate or one of their Italian dishes, but I still go back to my usual (slouvaki plate). I love dipping my pita in extra tzatziki sauce. Oh and bonus? The slouvaki plate comes with a side greek salad! Score!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend frequents here so much the server knows his favorite order by heart (although he likes everything). He swears it is just as good as Greece and I think it is just as good as Chicago's greek town. All the orders come with fries (not stated on menu)  which are mediocre. The sauce is delicious and you can acquire hot sauce by request.  The pita is so big and filled with delicious meat I thought I was going to have leftovers but it was too delicious and I ate it all.  Best in Phoenix.

Got the fries today, so much better! Hot, crispy, delicous. I need to find more places like this..."}
{"text":"I don't know what else to say about this place that hasn't already been said... but it is honestly the BEST Mediterranean spot in the valley. Gyros, shawarma, hummus, french fries, kabob... and get this: they also make homemade pasta! Absolutely delicious. It's a family owned restaurant and I had such a nice conversation with the owner; she's a sweetheart and is hands on with everything about the business. ALWAYS order the tzatziki sauce with everything you get!"}
{"text":"I love chicken gyros and this place is one of my favorites! So good! Definitely check it out!I always dip my fries in the Tzatziki sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"On point!! Ordered take out right before closing time. Gyro meal, chicken Greek salad and spaghetti! It was delish! Clean little spot and the food was perfect with great flavor. Will def be back. $24.00 fed my family of 3 and we were full!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've only had the gyro here, and it's amazing.  I'm afraid to try anything else because I don't think I'd like it as much as the gyro! If I wasn't so poor I'd go here every week (seeing as how the gyro is only $5, it must mean I'm REALLLLY poor!)"}
{"text":"The owners of this place are awesome and the food is just as good. Our favorites are the gyros and the chicken kabob plate. The kabobs are served over a bed of yellow rice with sauted/stewed veggies that are amazing. The chicken is incredibly good as well. It come with a salad that is probably the freshest salad you well ever get at a fast food place. Their pastas are very tasty as well. Highly recommend king gyros, I guarantee you will be pleased."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants. The owner is extremely attentive, nice, and knowledgeable. Their chicken kabobs are delicious and so are their gyros. The restaurant is a little small but cozy and they take really good care of you. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is delicious. I have to at least come to this place 3 times a week. I really recommend for everyone to please stop by this place and try their chicken pita especially. Wonderful service as well"}
{"text":"Very good, clean atmosphere, Greek Salad was generous and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place enough to spend 75% of my lunchtime driving to get to it on occasion. Everything I have tried is absolutely delicious! I've had the gyro salad, and the grilled chicken salad.  Mmm mmm good! The sauce they use is very flavorful, and the pita bread is great."}
{"text":"I had a very good chicken salad from there today, I smothered the chicken in their AMAZING hummus, and dipped the veggies in the dill dressing and it hit the spot for lunch! The pitas as very good too. The salad coulda used a little more olives and feta..."}
{"text":"My most favorite pasta next to my grandma's. My husband loves the suvlaki plate. My 5 year old will eat everything off both our plates! Go! Go! Go!"}
{"text":"I love this place-probably the best Greek food in town and its evidenced by how busy it always is.  The family knows their customers, they have my favorite items memorized and if I get an order to go for lunch at work, they are fast and very friendly.  Very very tasty, and even better that its not a commericialized place, their advertising is stricly word of mouth.  This is a small business restaurant run very well."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Great service!! Best baclava in this universe!!! If you're looking for Greek food, this is the place to be. The meat is perfectly seasoned and the owners are very nice people."}
{"text":"I love their chicken Cesar salad. Flavorful chicken and come with lots  of chicken! Their chicken teriyaki is good too. Who could imagine that we could get such a nice teriyaki chicken at Greek restaurant!?"}
{"text":"Best Greek in town. Sweetest family owns and operates this gem. Gyros are great buy everything on the menu is fantastic. Wish they were open on Sunday though."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the Gyros plate, my husband had the shawarma and chicken kabobs. The gyros was tender and so tasty, not to mention the HUGE portion you get. The salad it comes with was very fresh and crisp. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Circled the park lot of this Strip Mall before finding the restaurant.  Pet peeve-why are address so unclearly marked?  Anyway, King Gyros is the bomb!  The smells drifting from the restaurant were tantalizing.  I ordered the chicken pita and hubby got a chicken sandwich.  Not much difference except mine was in pita bread and he was in a roll.  The Tzatziki sauce had a nice flavor of dill and yogurt.  Both plates came with a serving of fries.  The chicken was flavorful and succulent.  Patrons kept coming in at an early happy r to either dine in or take out.  The food is fresh and owners are Greek and nice.  Prices are definitely affordable in this casual place. Worth the trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have tried many gyro placed but this one is the best!! If you like a variety get the combo plater. But I still love the Gyro and Greek salad. The gyro is overfilled with the best meat. You'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this is a limited scope review based on the sirloin gyro and the friendly, family service alone, having no experience with the rest of the menu.  I see no need for there being any \"rest of the menu\".  Passed this place a dozen times over the past several years but wasn't hungry/wasn't meal time  or they were closed, but finally was passing by at mealtime, starving - and they were open.   I don't know how \"authentic\" a \"sirloin gyro\" is - I don't care - it is without a doubt the absolute best gyro I've ever had.  I've paid more for others in settings with more of that \"sophisticated ambience\" bidness, but this place has its own \"family-run lunch counter\" lack of pretentiousness, including the Greek travel posters that's an ambience in it's own worthy right.  But that joyous gyro - man, that thing is good! Stuffed full and absolutely overflowing with strips of incredibly tasty marinated beef - never had one quite like it.  Friendly folk behind the counter brought food to our table outside the front door - inquiring as to how good it was -with clearl pride in product.  Came w/fries which were fine - but that sirloin gyro - mmm - makes this little place worthy of being your destination rather than an afterthought when in the hood."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly and prices are great.  \"Food is amazing!\" - Girlfriend.  Added quote \"Stop quoting me on stuff.\""}
{"text":"Happened upon this place by accident.  It's tucked away in a strip mall and is hard to see from the road. But OMG this place has great food.  I was happy right away when I walked in to see how clean this place is.  The people were friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Chicken Fajita (Middle Eastern Style) and have never tasted anything so good.  I got mine without the Pita but my husband got his with and loved it.  Ive been there three times now even though we live and work on the other side of town.  Will go back again as a special treat.  Seems like there a quite of few regulars there and it's like a neighborhood meeting spot.  Loved it!  Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great Mediterranean food this is the place. Friendly and fast service. Their shawarma gyros are very good. You will leave satisfied"}
{"text":"the chicken fajita pita plate is huge and always a good choice..."}
{"text":"The food here is good, pipping hot, fresh, and not over spiced or sauced. Location and food prices are great for all you ASU West Campus students, so go take a walk off campus for a change and stop eating in that thing they call a cafeteria! Service and the staff here are great people, make sure to tip handsomely because of this. Although the space to eat is minimal during lunchtime. 

Today, a huge family decided to take up half of the restaurant, which was very awkward for other patrons. I took my meal to-go today, but sitting in normally isn't too bad. Its not much to look at, but they're for the most part sanitary and efficient at the food and service part."}
{"text":"King Gyros was absolutely amazing. All the ingredients used for the salad were incredibly fresh even though I went 30 minutes from close. The woman at the register was very kind and helped explain all the items on the menu and brought the food to the table while it was still piping hot. The portions were enormous so make sure to bring your appetite. The food was more expensive than I had anticipated but upon seeing the serving size I understood the price"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. 100% the best there is when it comes to gyros. Fast service and very fresh. Had the normal gyro sandwich with their sauce...very good. 
If you want authentic greek food, you will get the best here."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this gyro shop for about 2 years. At first, the service seemed kinda formal and very \"strictly business.\" However, after my third visit, the family that runs the restaurant began to recognize me and became friendlier. Now, I'm always greeted by smiling faces and questions about school, my family, and the like. They are fantastic people. Perhaps it is a cultural difference? 

The food is what keeps me coming back. Absolutely in love with their gyros. The meat, veggies, and pita taste fresh and never over cooked. Fries are okay, nothing special but that doesn't bother me because I go for the gyros. 

Overall, this is a great neighborhood spot run by a cool immigrant family."}
{"text":"I fully agree with Amanda B. on this one. Overall, mediocre at best. Hopefully you have one of their little coupons too, because they are a little overpriced. JT Gyros has this place beat by a mile."}
{"text":"If you follow any of my reviews you will see I am attempting to try every Gyro place I pass by.  I have easily eaten at 30-40 unique shops and each has their ups and downs but few have the complete package for me. Kings is no exception.  I would say they have the best Tzatziki of any place I've eaten at locally.  They use the same Pitas as most good places do.  Yet they lost me with the generic borderline grocery store frozen fries.  The establishment is nice, they people are nice.  I would have dropped a fifth star if the fries had not bored me."}
{"text":"This is one review I feel horrid writing anything negative since the lady owner was so accomodating to us (and actually cared if we liked the food), however, I eat an awful lot of my favorite ethnic food and feel pretty qualified to write on it.  
OK, the hummus was really fresh which was a plus but, for me, a tad too much garlic  altho my table companions liked it (so I'll shut up).  Good pita served with it that was toasted just right, tho.
The gyros itself and the pita were A+, the tzatziki had a little too much dill in it, and where was the diced cucumber I am so acclimated to in it?  But the tzatzkiki consistency was thickish which is right, because sometimes stores make it way too thin and runny.
But the gyro was muy good.  Why do other gyros joints don't have fresh cooked meat like this and their gyros are always so overcooked and burnt?  Not at King Gyros.  Very fresh cooked meat = wonderful and juicy like it's supposed to be.
The baklava was good, too, but no nuts made it go somewhat downhill.  I miss the nuts..sorry.  I'd pay for the nuts to be put in it myself.
But the gyro meat--and the nice, fresh pita bread--tops!!!  Some of the best cooked gyro meat I've ever had...and they don't skimp on the servings either since you get a really fat portion of meat with none of this fake-you-out-by-using-fillers-like-lots-of-lettuce-on-top stuff.  Worth the trip just to get the gyro, frankly...it's superb!!!!  The BEST I've had here so far!
Definitely trying this place again.  I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars, so--in the name of strictly testing (yeah, sure)--I have to come back and re-test all.  See?  Anything for fairness...gawd, but I love that excuse to eat great food....
Prices are very reasonable, by the way."}
{"text":"I've only had the chicken pita with the sauce on the side. I must say they put plenty of chicken on the pita. The fries aren't that bad either."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and the food and service are both always great! I've had the gyro as well as the salad, and they're both fantastic! It's a perfect spot for lunch with indoor or outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This family ran business is the best! The food is so good, my mouth waters for it.  The owners are awesome & so friendly! I highly recommend trying this place, you get a lot of food too."}
{"text":"Alright. So I realize this is a gyro business, and yes they are reaaaaaally delicious....however I have to give most of the credit to their burgers. Burgers? At a gyro place? YES! And let me tell you, they have the best burgers anywhere. Homemade meat they grind in house and the flavor...o.m.g. So good. The meal will run you about 9 bucks, but lets be honest... I will pay anything for a good burger. Do it..get one and tell me how amazing it is. I dare you!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my family's favorite Greek restaurant.  It's a family-run place in a strip mall but so, so much more than the location and the sparse decor.  The best way to sum up the place is what the lovely woman who works the counter once told my mother: \"We make everything with love.  You have to make money to stay open, of course, but it's the love that keeps people coming back .  You can tell when there's love in the food.\"  I love the warmth of this place, Greek music and all.

The made-to-order gyros is the thing to get, a sandwich for a big meal and the plate for a huuuge meal.  The meat is hot and fresh (which is not always the case at Greek sandwich places) and the vegetables are crispy.  The fries are always piping hot.  The falafel is also great.

Eat here and eat here often.  Know that there's someone in SF that wishes he were in your place as you hungrily eye your neighbor's ramekin of tzaziki sauce...

Beware!  The place closes at 8 and sometimes by 7:30.  All good things..."}
{"text":"Okay....  I love a good Gyro and anything Greek and this spot hit the mark.  The Greek salad was awesome and the Gyro was served traditional!  I will be back on my next visit to AZ!!!"}
{"text":"I have never reviewed this place although I have ate here more than 5 years! They have quality food and I love everyone that works here! My go to is the chicken greek salad. Grilled chick"}
{"text":"Chicken Gyro was a huge portion of yumminess, seasoned well, pita was fresh, sauce was traditional and not watered down like other Gyro places I have tried.  I will definitely be back to try some other selections from their abundant yet not overwhelming menu."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great gyros and super nice owners. We always stop by when in the area. I highly recommend King Gyro!"}
{"text":"This is one of the very few best Mediterranean food in Arizona. Tasty and fresh ingredients, and kind owners. This is a must go to place. Love their salads, gyros, kabobs and fries."}
{"text":"I've been come to King Gyros for years.  It's family owned and the lady who works the counter is always super nice.  The food is excellent.  The sauce for the gyros is amazing and goes great on everything.  It's a type of tzatziki sauce, but it tastes different.  I know they add dill to it, but it's the best tzatziki sauce I've ever tried."}
{"text":"I ate here three times in a week...

That's how much I love this place.  I get the regular gyro, and I cant tell you enough how delicious the food is here. 

It's a small little shop across the parking lot from Pure Fitness.  If you dont look for it, you can miss it.  

I havent tried other foods, but what i have eaten, has been amazing.  Im sure I will go here again this week and look forward to maybe something new."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to check this place out, since we were on this side of town and really wanted some gyros.  It came suggested to us by a co-worker of his, so we figured it would be delicious!  It wasn't...

It's a small place with about 8-9 tables, which I don't have any problem with.  If it's good, it shouldn't matter how big or small a place is.  We ordered our food and sat down.  The woman at the counter was quite nice and seemed very helpful.

We started with the hummus, which was wonderful.  That's the main reason I didn't give them 1 star.  The pita served with it was warm and soft.  We were really looking forward to our gyro combo meals, hoping this was a precursor to the rest of the meal.

Well, here I go...the gyros were hot and really full of meat.  My mouth was watering at the thought of biting into it.  Then, I did.  The tzatziki sauce didn't taste right.  It was all dill, and had no hint of a cucumber flavor, which I normally find so refreshing in a gyro.  Not only that, but it was so oily, it kept separating at the bottom of the pita.  Then, there's the meat.  I found it greasy and bland.  I like juicy gyro meat, but I also like when you get a bit of the crust from the outside.  I went to taste a bit of the crust, and it dripped grease on my finger and felt spongy.  It seemed very unappetizing.  I'm a meat-eater, and would usually have eaten every last bit of it, but I ended up pulling most of it out of the pita (which was the best part of it) and dipping it into the rest of our hummus.  

And, finally, the fries on the side.  They were soggy, so I didn't eat any of them.

I've read over the other reviews, and I guess gyros really are a matter of taste.  We won't be returning here, and will keep going to our main gyro restaurant.  But, we also won't stop looking for other really good gyros around town."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't thought to review this place before! It's a small strip center location with just about enough seating for a lunch rush. I've been going to this restaurant for years and think they have some of the best Greek food in the entire Valley. Especially their gyro. I have not had one better anywhere. The meat is always moist and delicious and you get tons of it whether you order the gyro sandwich, salad or plate. The pitas are soft and fluffy. The taziki is so flavorful you'll find yourself asking for extra just to make sure every bite is coated in it. It's a family-owned business that's makes you feel like family when you dine there. I always see lots of Greek people eating at this restaurant which is always a good sign! I took my 20 month old granddaughter to eat there twice in the last couple weeks and she demolished the gyro meat and all but ignored her french fries, which are good too, so you know it's got to be tasty."}
{"text":"Best Gyro place in the valley run by the sweetest family! Can't say enough good things about this place. Trust these reviews, if you eat here I guarantee you won't be going to another gyro place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owner is so friendly and remembers us (we come very often). I've had several things on the menu and have not been disappointed! My latest favorites are the souvlaki and chicken plates."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly family run business.

Benny makes the best tzatziki sauce in town.

I always get the souvlaki plate with their delicious rice and his wife remembers extra pita, extra sauce. My wife loves their gyros. Their chicken pita is great too. Everything is great.

Go there now."}
{"text":"The customer service is great, the place is clean but the food is ehh. I heard good things about it and a lot of good reviews on here but just not for me."}
{"text":"If i say King Gyros is the best gyro shop in valley ,it wont be an exaggeration.The staffs are very friendly and shop is very clean."}
{"text":"This is the spot to get Gyros when I'm in AZ (will be back there in a few days).  I've been going here every time I visit for the last few years and it's been very consistent.  The same owners, same great food and service.  I've tried almost everything and the only complaint (if you can call it that) was when I got the Gyros salad, there was TOO MUCH meat on it.

Definitely a place I can trust when taking a friend to get some gyros for the first time.."}
{"text":"This is the place I will continue to go! Outstanding service and delicious food!The owner and the staff really do convey the importance of consistency, so my family and I get the same delicious & fresh outstanding dinners every time with a smile from the owner. And, she remembers your name! 
I've been to the mediterranean, most Western European countries on business and personal travel. This is the best!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this out after reading about it on Yelp!  Why we haven't been here sooner is beyond me - we live less than a mile from it!!!

My husband and myself had the gyro platter - very good and the place was hopping - not sure if it was because it was a Friday or as we have now learned it's that good.  And there are truly Greek people working there - now that is authentic!  Nothing fancy - you're eating on paper plates with plastic ware - easy clean up!

Definitely going back and trying something different...."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek place in town. The chicken is always tender and juicy and they have the best customer service. We probably eat here at least once a week and it is always delicious."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but the customer service is beyond belief. This family owned and operated restaurant could not have done it better not once but two days in a row. in addition I saw how personable they were with all of their customers remembering not only who they are but what they order. If you're in the area do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"No time for a full review.  Just go here

Ok.  Now time for the review.   Why?  Because everything from the shawarma to the kabobs to the gyros is great.   Friendly family runs this place.   It fancy at all - it's a hole in the wall in an ordinary stop mall.  But sooo good"}
{"text":"Yum! Came here because of the reviews and the king delivered! This place has a following, the regulars noticed it was our first time and assured us all the food was good and fresh made, they were really passionate about this place. I ordered the falafel pita and my husband got the classic gyro. Owner was so friendly and welcoming. The place has a very warm feel and was totally packed with happy customers.

Food came out at a good pace and was delicious! Very authentic and fresh taste, big portions and big flavor. Even ordered some falafels togo becuase they were so good and the owner was kind enough to give me their house made hummus with it for free because she said it tastes better together. Loved this place.

I will be returning to eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean food! I wish they had more locations. Loved the chicken Pita and the Gyro platter. The staff is very nice and really appreciates their patrons."}
{"text":"LOVE...LOVE...LOVE THIS SPOT.......BOMB TAZIKI!!!.....low maintance with low prices....and delicious. ...staff always keeps it clean and takes care of what you need......mom and pop place with what matters, customer service and delicious food...yum! Thank you"}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever!  The owners are cool, too...

The sauces are awesome.  Quality is top notch.  This is a 5 star spot!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time. Had the gyro and souvlaki and both were fantastic. Great prices and family run...will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It was the number and quality of the reviews that brought me here. I am in the area a lot and didn't know they were here and that was my loss. Whenever I go to a Greek or Mediterranean restaurant, I go for the hummus and falafel first before I decide to get anything else. I order a side order of falafel to taste them without any sauce or anything to interfere with the flavor. The hummus was good but it was the falafel that was really good. I have been to some places where it's just a small, hard and dry hockey puck. These were a generous size (.50 cents each when I got them a la carte with my hummus). They were fried crispy, but were light with a great texture and taste. I can't wait to come back and have them in a pita; and I look forward now to their other dishes. Great little place; glad I found them."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gyro I've had in Phoenix. The portion size of meat was almost amazing and it was fresh and well seasoned, served with thick cut fries. My accomplice had the chicken pita, moist, flavorful well seasoned chicken and again lots of it. Their menu had lots more interesting things on it and all of the food I saw come out looked really good. It would be hard not to like this place."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, fast, affordable and all homemade. The pita bread is unbelievable! The hummus is sooooooo good, baklava melts in your mouth and when it's all gone, you'll be looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food at a super high level. Love this place! We drive across town just to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place was good, clean and quick! Fries were not the best but the gyro and Greek salad was amazing. I got it to go but would have gladly eaten inside as the atmosphere was pleasant and clean."}
{"text":"They're from Chicago so the food is like Chicago style hot dogs, tamales Gyro the gyro sauce is delicious. I haven't had anything I didn't like...Worth a try. I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Excellent combo plate! Full of flavor and the chicken was especially amazing!! The tzatziki sauce is thick and creamy with lots if dill which I love!! Also the baklava is very buttery and flakey. Even the pita bread was buttery and toasted on the grill... I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I forgot to write an updated review from my last visit several months ago. I used to love this place but like the other review stated, the quality has really gone down and so had the service. I'm not impressed anymore.There is absolutely not a single reason why this restaurant excels it's competition. Decrease in quality, decrease in customer service, no thanks."}
{"text":"It seems people like this place a lot.  I happened to be making one of my rare trips to this side of town for a doctor's appointment and as part of my quest to discover the wealth of little mom & pop restaurants in the Phoenix area this one popped up in my Yelp search.  I've had some good Gyros and some really awful ones but I'm always open to try something new.

The place itself is pretty plain, in a strip mall with a couple of small metal tables on the sidewalk. Nothing fancy about it. The man at the counter who I'm guessing is the owner's son was nice and an older man, who I'm guessing is the owner, came around to all of the tables to chat. It looks like they get a high percentage of return customers.

I like that there is only one size fountain drink at one set price. I ordered the Gyros with a drink and was automatically given fries. The fries are good but if I had known they were included I would have asked for a side salad or nothing at all ... not a big fries eater.  Suggestion to them is to ask if the customer wants fries.

The Gyros itself is traditional (thankfully) with much more meat than most places serve. The other traditional ingredients include onions, fresh tomato and tzatziki, no lettuce.  The biggest difference is the meat, which is dry and flavorless at so many Greek restaurants. Here it is moist, thick and very flavorful.  My taste buds tell me they use lamb, which has a distinctive taste. Their meat comes from Kronos in Chicago which pretty much has a lock on wholesale Gyros meat distribution.

If you are not in the mood for Gyros this place has a pretty eclectic menu ranging from hamburgers and hot dogs to spaghetti and even catfish filet.

I like and encourage mom & pop restaurants and always try to support them with my business. That doesn't always mean I'll come back if the food or service is bad. King Gyros has their act together and I know I'll be back next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love, Love Love the food and the staff, Perfect as always

Thank yoiu for a great hot meal on a cold windy night."}
{"text":"I love gyros and this is my favorite place to get them. I have yet to find anyplace that even comes close when it comes to quality and quantity, especially for the price. The people who work there are very friendly and chat me up like they recognize me regardless of whether or not they really do. They always get my order right and they have me in and out very quickly. I go here every chance I get, even if it means travelling across town since I live on the extreme west side."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Expect a bit of a wait during lunch time because it will be busy.  There's only a few tables inside this small restaurant so I recommend take out if you can.  One of the best gyros I've had and definitely the best on the west side.  Their prices are reasonable.  Two huge gyros, both with fries, and one fountain drink ends up being about $13.  The rest of the menu looks really good, but the gyro is so good I can't get myself to order anything other than that."}
{"text":"Family and I cannot get enough of this place, we all love the gyros.  Owner is super friendly and if she recommends something try it you will not be disappointed; unless your just plain picky."}
{"text":"Love it!  I only have ordered the special number 1 which I like a lot and have not tried anything else!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had.  I prefer the chicken gyro but the beef one is good too.  The seasoning on the meat is amazing and the Tzatziki just makes it even better.  I could eat here every day.  Price is pretty reasonable too ($5.99 for gyro and fries) and you can sub fries out for a salad for just an extra dollar.

I think they raised the price a little - from $5.99 to $6.25.  Hmmm.... Interesting.  Also, on a side note, why is this place always packed with cops at lunch?  I guess people will either feel very safe here OR very uneasy."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since 1997 when the original owners were there, the two brothers or at  least I think they were brothers but anyway this was back when pure fitness was in the same parking lot for those of you can remember that far back. I used to tear up a good work out then go get myself a gyros with extra tomatoes or a steak Pita. Now a days I only stop by when I'm on that side of town and I get the chicken kebab salad and I add a little extra gryo meat on top. Love this place and I love the owners."}
{"text":"The owners are like my second set of parents. They care about my family and always hope for our well being. Their food is amazing and you can tell they put their love into their cooking. It always tastes amazing. The gyro(euro) and chicken pita are godly. The dill sauce is also amazing. The only downside is I eat there so often I have to give my taste buds a break lol. Can only handle so much nostalgia and flavor as I've been here since we moved from Ohio 14 years ago. Go there, relax and eat."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The owners are very friendly and welcoming. The food portions and prices were great. The gyro pita was delicious! Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"While waiting to get a tattoo at Lucky Draw, the boys in the shop said they were ordering from here and asked if I wanted to go in on it. Sure, I said, not expecting anything spectacular but needing sustenance for the 3+ hour tattoo I was about to get. 

What a surprise! I'm judging on the one meal that I had but Holy Sheep the Veggie Pita is to die for, Veg lovers!

The veggies tasted fresh and yummy and not all mushy. The red sauce, I'm not sure what it is but will have to find out, was so dang flavorable. 

The flavor? Amazing. My taste buds were ecstatic.

If they can make a near-vegetarian girl happy and they're not even a vegetarian restaurant, I imagine the omnivores will make out like bandits here as well. New fan for life and very glad there is actually another decent veg-friendly restaurant on the West Siiii----eed!!!

UPDATE: The next time I went, it was just like a curry sauce, no red sauce. Huh? Not as tasty"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Loved the environment super friendly staff -- family owned business. Food was great I really enjoyed the chicken gyros and french fries. PHX people, eat up!!"}
{"text":"I was one of their 1st customers. Have been going there forever. Staff has never changed. Super clean as always. All food made to order. Great all around gyros fast food restaurant. American Greek food with French fries. Not like authentic Greek food. But stupid good and addictive. Love this place"}
{"text":"I would never go here because the customer service is awful there is absolutely no appreciation for the customers I ordered myself a gyro and went on with it when I got home realize there was nothing on except meat.I contacted the place a lady on the phone said please stop by I will give you a new one when I get there after work she gave me a hard time in front of other customers and proceeded to say in the past 16 years that she's been there she's never made an error what huge mistake this isn't the first time they messed up order not recommend i.the lady behind the counter person that said she didn't care if she lost my business..the best place to go check out its 35th Ave and Greenway behind the Popeyes Chicken"}
{"text":"By far the best Greek family in town and best Greek food. Been eating at this place for 20+ years. I have tried other Greek places while on vacation but none compare. The owners run it and make everything fresh daily. Even the cooks in the back are friendly. Wonderful place to get great Greek cuisine. Thank you for the many years of friendship and laughter King Gyros."}
{"text":"Pita chicken club is So yummy. Great food and good customer service. Highly recommend on going never ever tried Greek food and this place hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great food! Prices so reasonable, too. I'm so glad to live less than a mile away. The female owner is really cool, too. At first, she seems a bit no nonsense but I've managed to strike up conversations with her while waiting and she's as sweet as pie once you get to talking with her. A great family owned local business that will not disappoint!!! Their menu is huuuuuge, not just gyros. Italian, sandwiches, pastas, appetizers and more.
If you want really great food, eat here!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of meals offered with awesome prices. The food is fresh and filling. Cute little shop for best friend lunches or small family meals."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, \"OMFG! Great Food!\"
Such a fantastic, family-owned greek restaurant that has fast service and are extremely welcoming! Great Gyros, awesome Gyro Salad and don't even get me started on the hummus. (Even their burgers are out of this world!) So far, this place has never done me wrong. Try it, and you'll be AMAZED!! 


Their food: Phenomenal; Service: Legendary; Price: Pocket & Tummy, fully satisfied!"}
{"text":"Delish and great service. The gyros are very good. The folks who work here are very friendly. The Baklava is just okay, I have had better. I will definitely go back here more often. I live nearby and this was a new find for me."}
{"text":"The two star is not for the food but the fact that they increased the price for the food. I remember that when I started going there, the meal I always got was a dollar less. Overnight I see that the price has gone up a dollar. I hate sneaky practices where they make small price changes to make a little extra dollar. As far as the food goes, I think the gyros are pretty decent. As far as the Pita's go, I do not think they are handmade so it tastes like anywhere else.  The people are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Best Gyros in the State! I have been eating here for YEARS, and can't say enough great things. People drive from far southeast Valley it's so amazing. I always get gyros value meal with salad instead of fries, don't forget the baklava!"}
