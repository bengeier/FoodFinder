{"text":"Good food, like Home, the fried calamari was good except the portion was very small, just enough for one person. The dinner portions are fine."}
{"text":"Very Bad place to eat .charge you $2 extra dollars for split a food,.BS.   never again."}
{"text":"Their Homemade Lasagna was Great!
You've gotta try Rizzo's Spaghetti House.

Try out their other restaurant, located off Cherry Road in Rock Hill."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very nice staff. Everything was great the eggplant parmesan was perfect so was the veal and fried ravioli."}
{"text":"Before going to Rizzo's last night, after attending ILMS graduation, we checked online to see the hours.  The website said they were opened until 10.  Tuesday - Saturday: 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM.  We arrived at approximately 8:40, got a nasty look from one of ther servers, asked if they were open until 10, she immediately said 9:30 (strike 1), we then said to another server \"are we too late for dinner\" - NO (strike 2).  As we were taken to our table, the hostess threw down the silverware (strike 3), so we left and went down the street to Mama's Pizzeria and they were glad to serve us even though it was 8:55.  We called Rizzo's and asked to speak to the Manager.  We were told he couldn't come to the phone because they were busy.  We just left there, they weren't busy (3 families in the dining room who already had their food.  We were told he would call us back - no call.  We won't be going there again.  If they are only open until 9:30 on a Thursday night they may want to change their website times.  We purposely called to make sure we (and they) would have enough time."}
{"text":"We really like Rizzo's!  My husband gets the egg plant parm and I get the lasagna.  We think both are very good!  We also like the house salad dressing; it is very good too. I would recommend this restaurant to people in the area."}
{"text":"Rizzo's is fantastic and authentic Italian food.  We love the food and place."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My husband and I just stumbled upon it for lunch today. They have the best chicken parmigiana I've ever had (I am a parm snob) we absolutely loved their food! My husband had the sausage roll and that too was excellent! We will be returning with our kids for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Good homestyle Italian cooking. Pleasant wait staff small but pleasant atmosphere.Huge portions, but for two dollar charge you can split with your partner.all in all a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Slow service each time we come here. Always an excuse. Food is adequate but not worth the wait when there are so many options in the area (and more coming each month). The last two trips the servers were new and unsure of the menu specifics and had to step away from taking our order to check. Both visits, once our order was placed, didn't see the server again."}
{"text":"If you are from Long Island and are looking for good Italian food keep looking.  The salad which comes with the entree was a little brown.  I got lasagne which was ok but my husband got veal Marsala.  The Marsala sauce was not like any we had ever seen.  It was almost creamy white and the mushrooms were either out of a can or jar.  Also it was loaded with onions.  There was no atmosphere and the staff was young and about as far from Italian as you can get.  Too bad.  Back to the search."}
{"text":"Dishes are excellently prepared, generous portions and the food is fantastic. They offer delivery and take out but if you want to dine in, plan to get there early as the dining room is small and the seating is limit. Even if you have to wait, it will definitely be well worth the wait!!! Hands down one of the best restaurants in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Have only had pizza here- it is great!  Thin crust NY style very similar to what I used to get when living in Connecticut!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Rizzos last Wednesday (September 20,2017) with a friend. We both had received posts in early September (postings of September 6,2017) with raving reviews of authentic Italian food and a menu that looked promising. 
When we got there we were confused if we were at the right place as it said \"MICHAELS\" on the sign.  We had been told it was in the old Pork'N'More building which is where we were.  As we looked at the menus and our phones trying to decide if to stay or look for the right place, a waitress came over and we asked.  Michael's was the name of the last place the restaurant went by! 
We were given a paper menu that stated 'soft opening' and that didn't have much at all of the items on the menu that was shown on Facebook and they had prepared to give at the restaurant.  It was mostly sandwiches,  spaghetti and meatballs and antipasto or shrimp salad. And two desserts.
I got the calzone and my friend got the salad.  
I was still hopeful for a great meal but the calzone was unlike any I had ever had before.  I expected a lots of cheese, a rich tomato gravy. What I got was alfredo sauce with ham in a biscuit type crust with a side of tomato gravy dipping sauce. NASTY!!! My companions salad looked/smelled much better than my food. I also ordered cheese bread that was brought to the table after our main course was half way over.  We both got different desserts a lemon cake, and cheesecake with strawberries that were both good. The wait between eating and ordering was VERY long.  You definitely couldn't eat here if you only get a hour for lunch! And they were not busy! Our drinks were water and tea. We were told their bread machine they had been waiting on for weeks had not shown up and maybe the hurricane had slowed down its delivery...??? For a  $40.00 lunch I think I'll go somewhere else next time. I do hope they get it together. It would be nice to have a good restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Ordered take out today. Chicken and eggplant parm, gnocchi and Caesar salad with ckn. They forgot the ckn on the Caesar salad, forgot the Russian dressing on the dinner salad and the sauce was so over cooked and salty on the entrees, it was awful. The gnocchi in sauce was flavorful and enjoyable. We will not, though, be coming back for seconds! 
Its proximity to Sun City is great, however location  isn't everything!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian dishes just like my Mom once made.  The gnocchi is my favorite but Chicken Marsala is high on the list.  My only complaint is the service.   We had the same young  waitress the last three times and she seemed a bit overwhelmed with the tables in her section.  
Small place with great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  I was expecting more.  If you go, just know it's very basic, interior is done cheaply, food was not tasty.  It's probably more for a very casual family dinner out.  I had a 'house specialty' dish cavateli and it had very little taste.  Had to add parm, salt, and pepper just to get some taste out of it.  No bread, they serve bread sticks. The salad is pretty gross.  Oh, and the blasting Italian opera was awful.  Hate writing bad reviews but it was not good when I went."}
{"text":"Our first visit...came in late on a Friday. Order Gnocci, Eggplant Parm and a few personal pizzas. All was great - we will be back. Service was fast and friendly. The prices are very reasonable. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"First off, it is LOUD!!!  This restaurant is in dire need of some type of sound absorbing panels.  It's a relatively small place, and when you have that many people, it's bound to get loud, and uncomfortably so.  At least now I know why so many people came in for to-go orders!  
Moving on to the food, it's pretty good and portions are large, but there are a few things that need to be tweaked.  
The complimentary bread sticks and marinara were ok, but our artichoke casserole appetizer was TOTALLY excellent!  My son ordered Caesar salad with chicken, yet it contained black olives, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese. Not exactly used to having a Caesar with black olives and tomatoes, nor mozzarella cheese rather than the typical Parmesan cheese.  My daughter's spaghetti with meat sauce appeared to be simply marinara sauce with torn apart meatballs tossed in it.  She thought the sauce tasted sweet, but I thought it was pretty good - and I HATE sweet spaghetti sauce.  I ordered an antipasto salad, which was fairly good, but way too many marinated veggies on it.  Whatever brand of pepperoncini peppers they use should be tossed out - they were terrible tasting, so get another brand, please!  The homemade vinaigrette was fantastic, so much so that I think they should sell that in jars to take home. We were going to order a Philly Cheese steak sub to-go, but when we found out that it only contained meat and cheese (no onions, no mushrooms, and no peppers - not that we like the peppers anyway) we opted out.  
There's not a great beer nor wine selection, as someone mentioned.  Wine is mainly grocery-store jugs and a few other bottles. I did have a glass of their Cabernet, and it really wasn't bad at all - but I'm not exactly known as a wine snob. ;)  
The waitress was extremely pleasant, super nice & attentive.  Upon entering the restaurant, I def. did NOT detect any odors inside (as someone else had mentioned) and the ladies bathroom was very clean. I will go back, just don't know if I can convince my son & daughter to return.  :(  That sad face is because I really like to support local family restaurants!"}
{"text":"First, get the Shrimp Tostini. It is just terrific!
Second, our hostess, Courtney, was so good at what she does. Very organized and VERY pleasant. 
Third, our waitress, Minnie(?), was wonderfully pleasant, even though she was totally swamped. 
This is a new place in an area that is STARVING for good eats. 
We may have a winner!  Fingers crossed. . ."}
{"text":"Excellent find in the middle of nowhere. Very easy to miss! If you never here use GPS. Everything I've eaten there is great. The sauce is a bit sweet which I'm not a fan of. But it's the best I've found. Nothing fancy! So don't bring to impress anyone. Great food though"}
{"text":"I went there excited about a new italian restaurant.  I was very disappointed.  First I could not get past the smell of mildew.  Alot of the tables and chairs looked like the old Di Dee's Diner.  The food was awful.  They said everything was homemade.  It tasted like everything was from a jar or can .  My family is from Manhattan.  I bet a pretty penny that it was not authentic.  
 
I will not be back .  I hate even giving the place 1 star."}
{"text":"The good: The food is tasty.
The bad: They charge extra for any changes. Table service is spotty and slow. They DO NOT DELIVER even though the menu says they do. Entree dishes are on the high side however portions are on the large side... I suggest sharing but they will probably charge you a $2 share charge. Iced tea is $2.50
I will probably return but will be very clear on extra charges for changes BEFORE ordering."}
{"text":"Terrible Chicken Parm!!!! The sauce looked/tasted like it was Prego, the Chicken was very dry and over cooked - much too thinly cut, and the cheese was the wrong kind. By wrong type of Cheese, I mean that good Mozzarella Cheese used by Restaurants doesn't burn dark when cooked. This junk certainly did!!! Way way over cooked and dark. The Penne Pasta that came with it wasn't anything special either, but truly I couldn't eat the Parm as it was that bad. Wife said \"send it back\", to which I wouldn't, as had no feeling that anything else would have been made better. 

Get good Mozzarella cheese and aluminate the Recada from your Chicken Parmesan, and don't make it wafer thin.

Photo is after gave up......... did the Server even notice that I hadn't eaten hardly any?

Nope"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding, 10/10 authentic food. The ambiance really gives it a big boost."}
{"text":"We were in the area and googled \"non-chain\" restaurants to try out.  While the outside may not look like much, the parking lot was FULL and man are we glad we gave this place a chance.  There was a short wait for a table but we were able to walk over to the bar area and get some wine while we waited.  Service was pleasant and acknowledging.  

Now let's get to best part...  I am a HUGE fan of Gnocchi, especially in an Alfredo sauce.  I ordered the Gnocchi & Broccoli in white sauce (alfredo), and I added grilled chicken.  

This dish was HANDS DOWN the best Gnocchi dish I have ever had.  The texture of the gnocchi was perfect, the chicken was perfectly cooked as was the broccoli, but the sauce, WHOA, the sauce, was amazing...  and FRESH!!!   We could not have been happier.  

Their bread sticks were really good too.  Thank you for the wonderful dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Big portions.  We were a party of  8. Sister and I shared the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Mom and another sister ordered a pizza.  Daughter ordered the personal pan Hawaiian pizza.  Son and nephew shared meatball spaghetti.  I think my brother in law ordered the chicken parmagiana. We also ordered the  fresh mozzarella and tomato platter.  Yummy! Next time I will try their lasagna!  The food was delicious!!  They served good portions.  We brought a lot of the food home and enjoyed it again!! :-)"}
{"text":"I honestly love the food but they refuse to honor their Go Play Save app coupon for a BOGO Entree.  My boss' kid was selling those local coupon books but now you can either buy the actual book or you can purchase the app on your phone.  Rizzo's will not accept the app coupon.  They will only accept printable coupons.  While I understand that they want to be able to track their discounts with printed coupons, the app does not offer a way to print so they are flat refusing to honor the coupon.

Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Even with great food, I feel like this is a disservice to their customer(s)."}
{"text":"Food is ok nothing special
Service is very slow
Staff not very professional
Biggest problem seems to be the kitchen
Management does not seem to be present or they are just not interested"}
{"text":"First time there, food was great but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Most of the staff had good service."}
{"text":"We will not be back. As u can tell by the pictures of the food, it is sub par to say the least. If u like heavy cream sauces and flavorless marinara then u may like it. I heard from many people that pizza is not good as well. We gave it 2 shots and both times we were so disappointed. One of the dishes was swimming in grease and inedible. My husband can eat any type of pasta and be happy,  but he could only eat a bite of the chicken parm and said it was cold and disgusting. We mentioned it to the owner and he said \"well that is what u ordered\", he didn't offer to replace or take it off. Most places at least ask u if there is anything else they could get you. Spent a lot of money and didn't eat anything. Worst  customer service."}
{"text":"First let me say that the owner and cook is a real Italian, in fact he was born in Palermo, Sicily my mothers home town. 

We spoke to each other in Sicilian dialect and today in South Carolina that is very rare.  

The atmosphere is not fantastic, but they make up for it by serving good solid simple Italian cooking that tastes good and is very reasonably priced.

We've eaten there twice and of course the first time was when they first opened and the wait was a little long, but I would chalk that up to first week disorganization.  

The second time the food came out fast and everything was great.  Try the Tortellini Parlematiano which was made with zucchini and a great tasting sauce. 
 
Having eaten in quite a few Italian American places I would say in this price range its really the best in the greater Charlotte area!  

I recommend it!  

Con affetto!"}
{"text":"Well, we now have logged six visits here, three lunches and three dinners and they have done extremely well and now deserve a rare five-star rating.  Here is why:

Family run and local in attitude.  They are not trying to be fru-fru or get a Zagat rating.  They just want to well-serve good solid Italian food to patrons.  The decor is truly home-made and quaintly Italian.  The focus is on food and service.

No reservations so be prepared to wait, but turnover is reasonable and the wait worth it.

The lunch menu is less in options and in prices than the dinner menu, but you can order off of the dinner menu if you pay an additional amount during lunch.  Bear in mind that it does depend on the kitchen having what you want ready to put together.  Dinner menu has parms and, our favorite, bolognese sauce.

A lot of Italian eateries have bolognese sauce, but few do it well.  Diced beef (sometimes with a little pork) marinated in milk and then slowly simmered with a little onion, carrot & celery makes for a rich (is it ever!) thick sauce put over pasta or in lasagna.  You will not be able to eat all of your portion because it is so flavorful and richly delicious.  The bonus is that you leave with a lunch portion for the next day.

We order the penne bolognese, with the cooperation of the kitchen at lunch and for a $2 extra charge.  A good item to try if this is your first time out.  The parms are veal, chicken and eggplant and are authentically prepared and served with pasta.  Lotsa food to enjoy.

They have a house Italian salad dressing that is simply red wine vinegar that is excellent.  Put that on your side salad.

One downside is that the wine is jug wine.  No need for a wine list, just go red or white.  The food is good enough with or without wine, so accept that this is local flavor in a nice way.

I hate to tell everyone about Rizzo's because it is already a hot destination and now people from the big city will be driving down across the border to enjoy this.  Suggest you come early to minimize wait time.

Happy, happy place to eat!"}
{"text":"Very busy on a Friday at 5:00. The food was better than expected. I could see that there is some tweaking which is understandable for a new restaurant.   It's not organized yet and the poor waitresses were running around and it was impossible to take the time with customers. Not their fault. They need more staff to accommodate the crowd. Not a bad problem to have. Long time to be waited on, get our meal, and to get a to go  box and check   
This is not a fancy restaurant. The decor is lacking for an Italian restaurant, you don't get that warm vibe. Very plain, almost cafeteria like. 
The food was good, nice salad and breadsticks with marinara sauce. The spaghetti was good. Seriously, no one needs portions this size. The pic I posted was after I was full"}
{"text":"My husband loved the chicken Marsala
My eggplant parmigiana was Ok.  Coming from NY  I am a big critic for eggplant. 
Fettuccini Alfredo my teenager said creamy"}
{"text":"Very authentic food and great service. We had ravioli and canneloni and both were very good. The almond tiramisu was worth the wait. Server was outstanding. The only downside to this restaurant is that ii is a very noisy place(do to low ceilings)"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! My dad and I sat there for 15 min before our beer came, the guy even refilled out waters twice. The server had know idea when our food was coming out! We waited for 40min and no sign of food. Never will come back... Brutal service"}
{"text":"The meat lovers pizza is phenomenal. It tastes just like the one that I had in NYC.
Their lasagna is very tasty. Their salads are vibrant and well prepared. I'll continue to update it as I work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Short 10 minute wait.  Far from fancy, but simple and tasteful interior.  Lighting is quite strange for a restaurant, but not expecting anything fancy in Indian Land.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The food came out quickly and was very good.  This is an excellent addition to the area.  VERY small, plan on waiting if you choose to go for dinner.  It is far from the best Italian meal I have ever had, but was very good and a dramatic improvement over anything in the area."}
{"text":"Wife and I went on Saturday night my spaghetti was hot and good. The salad was served on a hot plate....like it just came out of the dishwasher.....it was hot too. The wife calzone was cold in center but she liked it. Going to take friends tonight and have good thoughts it it be good. Service was fine. 


Well The service was the same because we had the same server. So I decided to try calzone because my wife was ordering it again.  It came out hot and as I was eating the cheese was like lava just keep coming. I got about half way through meal and told my friends. \"This meal reminds me of the Wendy's commercial....where's the Beef\" the one thin slice of ham was found in center with the ricotta. My friend meal came with the hot salad plate too. Please just put store salad plate in cooler"}
{"text":"Place was packed when we got there around 7 on  Friday night. Ten minute wait was okay. I prefer to frequent an establishment when it is busy as opposed to being the lone diners. They took our order fairly promptly; my wife ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and I ordered the Carbonara with ham and pancetta. Dinner comes with salad and bread sticks. 

15 minutes later and a reminder to the waitress- salad and breadsticks arrive. Nothing special. Kind of your typical diner style iceberg lettuce salad. Breadsticks were a little plain. Another 40 minutes pass and dinner arrives. Hot and fresh. After the salad and the wait I was prepared to be disappointed, but the dishes were not bad. Sauce was a little too thick, very creamy but almost milky tasting. Not buttery with a Parmesan overtone. Still it was pleasing- a solid C+ in my book.... My wife said a B.

No excuse for the wait though. Rizzo's obviously has some kinks to work out. 

A stop by the restroom on the way out confirmed that they can't handle being busy. Out of paper products and trash cans overflowing.

The restaurant is recently opened and I'm hoping they are learning and improving. I'll try them again in a few months."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had. We sat down around 6:20pm and it took over an hour to get our food. One table got up and left because it was soooo slow. The salad that was promised took 15 minutes to arrive and we never even got our breadsticks even though we were told 3 different times they were coming. Apparently there was only 1 person working the whole kitchen. I wish they would have said something before we wasted our time waiting. Honestly I've had better Italian food down the road. The service was sparse and not very friendly. I ordered Linguine and Meatballs. The meatballs were actually very good but the pasta was over cooked and there was way too much sauce for the amount of pasta given. I most likely won't be returning. I get better food and service at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight 
Salad not fresh
Bread sticks not fresh
Veal picca not seasoned enough
Service and price were ok
Will not go back  too many other good restaurants in the area
Also think I saw a waitress fixing salads without gloves on
can't be sure but when I passed the kitchen it sure looked like it"}
{"text":"Got take out chicken parm and spaghetti n meatballs.   First visit.   Place is basically a pizza shop.   Chicken was OK (soggy and very thin),  sauce OK (had better).  Pasta was good consistency.   Meatballs were really nicely done.  About all we really enjoyed.   Good flavor.   Salad was teeny,  and bread not great.  Bread coulda been cooked more,  actually.   Spices did not work either.   Stick with just garlic, oil and salt!  Asked for ranch,  and believe we got Italian?!  Tasted like straight vinegar.  More greens too!  More like 2 stars,  but being nice.. 

Portions overall were pretty good, although there was not much chicken.  Prefer it thicker and crispy too. 

Will try pizza next,  but given the prices,  not gonna chance it on other entrees.   Will hope they use this as constructive criticism.   Would like them to get better,  as there is a shortage Italian places in the area!"}
{"text":"JUST AWFUL FOOD AND SERVICE and if you would like more feedback and actually care about business you can message me on here sad to see that in a up coming area this wont last .."}
{"text":"Food add great flavor, just thought for the price quality would be better. Place is small but we go right in on a Tuesday night and overall a good experience. You get large portions, even the kids get tons of pasta. 
I would give them another try."}
{"text":"We have been here twice since it opened. Once was for lunch right when they opened. The service was a bit slow, but the waitress really tried and we weren't in a hurry. They brought delicious Italian bread with butter, the salad was delicious and our entrees as well. We didn't care for the meat sauce, but liked the marinara. I had the Eggplant Parmesan and my husband had the Chicken Parmesan. Aside from the meat sauce on our pasta, we both really enjoyed our meals. 

Fast forward to last week. We came at dinner time and decided to bring our kids. What a totally different experience! When we walked in, three different people were up front and none of them decided to greet us. After someone finally acknowledged us, she was marching back and forth nervous about where to put us (we all fit in a regular booth). Once settled, we waited about 10 minutes for our waitress. One thing we noticed is that the restaurant was very busy and also VERY noisy. So noisy that we couldn't hear each other and the waitress couldn't hear us. Finally ordered drinks and mozzarella sticks. Mozzarella sticks come out, bread sticks come out, still no drinks. Have to ask for our drinks twice. The breadsticks that have replaced the crusty Italian bread are crap. I get better breadsticks at chain pizza places. Now we wait.....salad comes out 30 minutes later. The pizza came out. It's doesn't look too good and tastes even worse. It was soggy and the mushrooms did not taste good at all. Not even my 11 year olds would eat it.

Now for the entrees. My Eggplant Parm was okay. This time it was much drier than the last time and hardly had any cheese baked on top. My husband's Chicken Parm was coated in Ricotta cheese. Yes, you read that correctly...RICOTTA CHEESE! It did not have Ricotta cheese when he first ate it at this same restaurant and, when we asked about it, we were told that's what a traditional chicken parm had on it. Sorry but that's not true. It's my husband's favorite dish and he has had it several restaurants through the country. This was a first for us. 

Then as we were cashing out, our waitress was our cashier up front and made it a point to watch my husband as he signed the receipt and added the tip. That is so rude. 

We had such high hopes for this place, but will keep searching for a good Italian place."}
{"text":"Service was the worst I have ever seen. They did not bring bread till the meal was over,they ran out of forks. There was an empty jar of grated cheese on the table & when I asked for cheese the waitress said they weren't allowed to refill it
Now for the food. I ordered chicken parm and it came burnt.I will not return."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. For me the tomato sauce is too sweet, like canned. The marinara is better. Calamari was good but chewy. The breaking on the chicken parm was odd for me- left a bitter after taste. They usually put ricotta cheese under the mozzarella cheese on it- so if you hate ricotta like me ask to leave it off."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating here and have had good
Food every time.  I wish they would get their website fixed though.  When we try to get folks to go with us, they want to see the menu but the links to their website never work."}
{"text":"I am apprehensive to write this review, especially since they are small and local. I was really looking forward to a new Italian restaurant but truth be told, I wish I had saved my money. They were very very nice, but the food was honestly terrible and the server was having a rough day. 

Food...

 The salad dressing is bottled and not a very good brand unfortunately. No one finished their salad. The breadsticks tasted old, they weren't fresh, warm, or soft and the marinara served on the side was insanely sweet tasting. I  know you're suppose to add a bit of a sugar to your sauce to balance out the acid, but they way-overdid it. This is assuming the sauce is freshly-made, which is debatable. 

I made the poor decision of ordering the Chicken Parmesan. I ordered before we tasted the breadstick sauce and immediately regretted it. My dinner was so sweet I could not eat it. The chicken was cooked nicely though. I tried a taste of my husband's lasagna and that did not taste quite as sweet, I'm not sure why?

They did let me switch the dish to the Franchaise which was way better, but still not something I would order again. Again, the sauce just didn't taste homemade to me. They were nice and offered the Chicken Parm to us for free. I personally would not eat it, but my husband hasn't met a meal he didn't like so in full disclosure he took it home....

Service..

Our server was a young woman who was very kind though perhaps having an off-day. She forgot silverware several times, left drinks empty for long stretches, and then filled them with incorrect beverages. She brought the breadsticks over to us late ...just lots of little things.  I served for several years in college, and so as long as you're friendly and make a basic effort you'll get your 20%, but I am hoping this was not the norm for her. 

I will say prices are extremely reasonable...which is why I had hoped it would be better. 

Lastly just a note, I noticed two desserts on the menu were labeled imported which I thought was very strange. It does not sound tasty to eat Tiramisu that was made and transported from Italy, just a customers opinion. When it comes to dessert fresh is always the best :) 

While I am all for second chances, I think this has to be our last trip to Rizzos."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to eat here. They weren't that busy and we got sat immediately. No one greeted us for at least 10 mins!! Server after server walked by and no one helped us. I almost went up front to ask if we were going to have any service but I happened to look up and made eye contact with a server and he looked at me and walked away really quickly and came over to help us. It was our first time here and we felt a little rushed. The server greeted us and asked what we wanted to drink. It took a while to get our drinks and when he came back he asked if we were ready to order. Very dry no small talk and not very welcoming. We ordered our food and he came back with salad and then bread. We waited a bit for our food. My husband got the lasagna and I got the chicken alfredo. Both were good. But we needed drink refills and our server never even asked if we needed anything else or fill up our drinks. Very short service but the food was good."}
{"text":"Quality of food is pretty good but my husband and myself were very disappointed at the long wait for our food, and how most of the items I requested they had \"run out of\" or had \"none prepared\".  No diet Pepsi , ran out of sweet tea and who knows where our breadsticks are because we never received them even after asking for them.  I wanted stuffed shells but was told there were none prepared so would I take manicotti as a substitute.  There are approximately 16 tables with 3 servers running around and then standing around doing much of nothing.  Waited almost 40 minutes for food.  I hope if I decide to ever come back my next visit is a little better."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service, great food. Don't let the modest exterior of the building fool you, Rizzo's is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"They have cut the chicken parm potion in half for the same price! Chicken was also very rubbery tonight for the first time but they did the right thing and took it off the bill."}
{"text":"Ambience is cozy and cute. I like the trompe loile window paintings along the wall. We ordered the lasagna and chicken fiorentina. Lasagna was pretty good but portion was small. Chicken was awesome and the portion was huge. Salad and warm breadsticks come with the meal, which is a very nice touch. I was thrilled they served French dressing! I don't see French dressing on many menus nowadays so this earned 2 thumbs up from me :) we will definitely be back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"This is our go to Family Italian place! Staff is wonderful and the food feels like grandma is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Best value for Italian with in 50 miles!!! Asked for Jake as your waiter.  Home made pasta and great service.   Worth the drive from Charlotte."}
{"text":"We ordered a large half meatlovers, half pepperoni, salami, and mushrooms, and an order of mozza sticks. The meatlovers was 18.99 and I saw that they charged 2 dollars for extra toppings. I figured I would need to pay extra for the mushrooms, since they aren't supposed to be on a meat lovers pizza. Which I had no problem with. The mozza sticks were 6.99. They told me the wait would be about 45 minutes for pickup. 
I got there 50 minutes later, and waited over 5 minutes to be acknowledged. During that time, 3 other people were served ahead of me. 
When I finally got in front of them in the cash and told them I was there for pickup, they said they would check on my order, but could collect my payment. It came to 40.02.
I asked why it was so expensive. The girl explained that they were charging me 2 dollars for each topping (pepp, salami and mushrooms). I said that makes no sense. Pepperoni and salami are already on a meatlovers, which I am paying for. She said I know this is going to make you angry, because it makes everyone else angry, but thats what we have been told to do. 
Needless to say, I was not happy. However, even adding up the 18.99, plus 6 dollars for extra toppings, plus 7.00 for mozza sticks, I still don't get 40 dollars. Even with tax. 

And the pizza was not that great unfortunately. The mozza sticks were absolutely delicious. But not the pizza. I will suck it up and drive to Papa Murphy's for a 12.99 half and half pizza. It's much better. 

They definitely need to sort out their pricing. That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. We were very excited about this place, but very likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"They have upped their game from a year ago and their food is now great. Their red meat sauce is excellent. Big portions with good prices.  We always ask for Jake as our waiter who makes sure we are well taken care of. Oh, their food puts Mama's food to shame."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. Sauce tastes like canned or jarred.  Has the Italian flavor, but I could make this sauce from a jar at home.

My son loved his chicken parmigiana sub. It was large and flavorful.  My husband had the stromboli and it was good, but sauce was as described.  I had to lasagna and it was plenty good, but sauce was as I described.

Atmosphere was like someone's back yard or basement  with the loudness of a crowded bar. The sound was uncomfortable.  People were yelling to be heard. Perhaps some of the customers need a hearing exam? 

Restroom was odd. 1 stall room. Had an old white desk with a chair mi is the seat, in the corner. Hardly decorative a someone dumped their old furniture here. Painted a rosy pink. Not very Italian feeling.  Could use a paper towel dispenser that functions.  They had a soggy roll on the white desk.

With the competition nearby, not sure I will go back to eat in.  Good service, ok food, good portion size, but too loud."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Excellent food (you MUST try the Linguini Pescatori!!), great service, and cozy atmosphere.  We have been here often, and have never been disappointed.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A nice little quaint Italian restaurant. It's family owned and they take pride in making amazing delicious Italian dishes. The service staff is friendly and very attentive. 

Pizza crust is the closest I have had to NY style pizza. Good sauce and fresh toppings. Their pasta sauces are delicious.  

Will definitely keep coming back. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Our first trip - and glad we did.  We've seen this place over the years and just never went. Seemed busy but location is a little away from us. They offered a buy one get one coupon in a local school book so we decided to go. Ambience is ok - little older place and small inside. I'm sure on weekends, this place packs up quickly and will be a wait. The menu is good - some dishes are priced well, others seem on the higher end. For our first trip, we selected the eggplant Parm and Lasagne.  Both were fantastic. The eggplant was my favorite and so good.  My daughter got spaghetti and meatballs. She liked it a lot as well. The food was very good to us. We got a cannoli for dessert - that was the one thing we will pass on next time. We got the \"large\" one to split. Trust me - not large. Taste was pretty good but we like more choc chips in the filling. They seem to have some good pizza options and we will be going back to try the pizza too. Overall, we were happy and will be going back."}
{"text":"Big portions of food, but when it comes to Italian food, it fails in at least one of its plates. I enjoy a good chicken Marsala, but this was simply not the case at Rizzo's. The chicken was like what you get at a cheap Chinese restaurant and the sauce tasted like the wine had gone bad, or just used vinegar instead. I'm sure there are other things on the menu that are good, but if they are going to charge $15 for a plate, make it with quality."}
{"text":"My second review and giving less stars.
Last night i ordered the Veal Marsala (gross)
The mushrooms were out of a can and it came with orange slices that made the sauce very sweet. The veal was in an egg batter that was slimy and falling off the veal  (franchise is prepared in egg batter) 
The veal was tough and stringy could barely cut threw it.

I'm realizing that somethings might be \"home made\" but they apparently make a make a ton of stuff a head of time and just reuse the same stuff for multiple dishes.

Like my first review I said that the lobster ravioli were good but in a weird sauce.
I realized after last night it's the same sauce they use for their linguine and clam sauce.
So I'm assuming they egg batter up a ton of meat and just add it to anything that is ordered and throw it in a different sauce.


Seems very lazy to me.
We tried it once,twice and then after our horrible meal last night 135.00 later 
We will not be going back!"}
