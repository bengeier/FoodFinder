{"text":"I have been back twice since my first visit and have tried the vegetarian breakfast sandwich and a soup with mushrooms, zucchini and leeks; both fantastic. Exactly the kind of food I wish I had time to make more often. Wholesome, fresh and full of veggies. The sandwich is made with a fresh, sweet bun. It is stuffed with an egg, melted cheese, caramelized onions, pinto beans and roasted red peppers, even my 10 year-old bacon-loving son loved it. The soup was hearty, warm goodness and under five dollars!!! The kids have each had hot chocolate and waffles and loved them. I tried the coffee for the first time last week and it was delicious. Service is amazing, prompt, friendly and the owners and their staff exude warmth."}
{"text":"LOVE that this place has opened in our neighbourhood! We've been eyeing it for months and finally got to try it today. Here's a summary:  - Service was excellent! Very friendly and efficient. The woman at the counter actually brightened up my day with her genuine smile. - Food was good. I got the pork belly po'boy sandwich and grainy salad, it was delicious! I usually have a fear of pulled-meat due to past experiences of dried, unflavoured meat that's soaked in sauce to mask the aforementioned lack of flavour. But this sandwich was different, it had bold flavours and an interesting combination of toppings that worked well together!  The meat was also tender and juicy. - Coffee (soy latte) was good but not extraordinary (but I'm a bit of a caffeine-snob). The prices are very reasonable (lower than Starbucks) and I would definitely return for another cup...but I wouldn't recommend it as a \"you must try their coffee, it'll blow your mind\" spot.  All-in-all, a very welcomed addition and if I could give a half star... I would give it 4.5."}
{"text":"Love this place....service style and fare all top notch....toronto needs more of this."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and thought I'd write about my experience.  I've had breakfast and lunch-type foods and both coffee and tea.  No espresso drinks.    The food is ok.  It's not amazing, it's not bad.  It IS a little too expensive for the location of the cafe and the quality of the food.  Basically, it's just solidly 'meh'.  Haven't had a chicken from here though.  The coffee is decent.  Not amazing, but good. People are complimenting the espresso drinks, which admittedly I haven't had yet.  I'm confused about people being excited about a cafe opening though - i need to walk by three cafes on Gerrard that are reasonably nice to get to this one....if anything, there's too many.  This one will be a great magnet for people going to the parks though.  What's to love about BG?  The service is ALWAYS amazing.  The people who work there are consistently delightful.  Seriously.  Basically all three stars are for service.  The decor is nice.  It's kid-friendly without being annoying to adults.  (Or at least me...I don't have kids but I don't hate them)."}
{"text":"Paid my first visit to Brickyard Grounds over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised by their food options. I had the pork belly po boy with a side Romeo salad and my girlfriend had the Peperonata sandwich with a grain salad. For $8.95, the portions were great.   The sandwiches were huge and delicious. The pork belly po boy was more like a pulled pork sandwich though. The romeo salad was a nice complement to the sandwich. The Peperonata sandwich had a very generous amount of peppers and the grain salad was especially tasty. It consisted of barley and dried fruits. I will definitely have the grain salad again.  On my way out, I ordered a single Americano for the road. It was a very solid cup!  Lastly, the staff were all very friendly and the decor was very well put together. This created a very welcoming environment.  Having grown up in the area over the last 26 years, I am happy that an establishment such as this has opened in the area. The law offices that have opened and closed in this location are no more (thankfully). I will definitely be paying many more visits!"}
{"text":"Great to finally have a place in the neighbourhood to get a good cup of coffee and some food. Friendly and fast service. Nice play area at the back to keep little kids occupied while you relax.  The pulled pork is great, as are the Aussie meat pies. Maybe in the future they'll expand their kids offerings a bit, but for now my 2 year old devours the mac and cheese every time."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when this place opened up in my neighbourhood! The coffee is delicious, the service is friendly, and I was impressed off the bat with their selection of food and drink for folks with special dietary needs (almond milk! vegan brownies! gluten free cookies!). It's a great place to catch up with a friend, bring a client, or get a little work done."}
{"text":"Great new coffee spot. The espresso is balanced - not too acidic and still very tasty. The breakfast cookie is dense and delicious! Classic carrot, oat, and raisin in double-high cookie form.   The cafe itself is clean, stylish and spacious. The place is complimented perfectly by some soft jazz is playing in the background right now.   Best of all, the staff is wonderful and service is quick. Sophie was cheerful and so accommodating. I'm happy to have this new spot right down the street.   Looking forward to the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"When I drove by this morning, the windows were papered over. Brickyard Grounds has closed.  Good to know that it's just a temporary closure and will re-open."}
{"text":"This place opened a block away from my house at the corner of Gerrard/Greenwood. It has since become my 7yr old daughter's favorite restaurant. She loves the grill cheese sandwich and earl-gray ice tea.   I personally like Te Aro's (Pilot) coffee better because I tend to have my coffee black with no sugar, but if i was to sugar it up, I believe the coffee at brickyard is just as good."}
{"text":"Food and coffee is great. Love the Mason's Breakfast and the peameal breakfast sandwich. It is over priced sadly for the portion you get, but, you'll be pleased with the quality."}
{"text":"Love this local spot! It has a great atmosphere during the week with great music, free wifi, and very kid/baby friendly. Great place to meet up for lunch or a coffee. On the weekend it's much busier. They have great brunch options and mimosas or other indulgences (local beer and wine). Their roasted chicken sandwich is so great that I'm not even tempted to try anything else though it all looks delicious. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous little cafe on Gerrard! The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food is amazing. My husband and I ordered a Breakfast Poutine and Breakfast Sandwich to share and it was more than enough food for the both of us. We also tried their hot drinks and I can attest that the mocha, ginger tea, and cider is all delicious. We plan on returning frequently for brunches this summer."}
{"text":"I gotta say in super impressed with the place.  Ok - I just did a cortado but the lunch menu is solid and it's got brunch in the weekends plus it's uber kid friendly. They've got a kids zone.   Staff are friendly an the natural lighting of the place makes it a great chill out spot to catch up on work (today anyways)"}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to the neighbourhood!  The place has such great charm and the owners are wonderful!  The food is absolutely delicious - can't wait to make my way down the list and try everything.  They have amazing meat pies and the beef brisket sandwich I had today was top notch.  I love the coffee and sweets as well (butter tart square = heaven) You will love it here!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot to go to for breakfast on the weekend. Staff are attentive and friendly. It was steadily busy and we never felt rushed to leave. I had the grilled cheese on sourdough with extra pulled pork. It came with a simply dressed kale salad. Ordered a small order of fries on the side. Delicious!  Will definitely make the effort to return. Most people in Leslieville head for Lady Marmalade and subject themselves to a ridiculous wait. Come here instead. You can order different types of waffles or have your big breakfast of eggs, brioche, etc. A much more civilized experience for a weekend if you ask me."}
{"text":"I've been in a few times now .... Great coffee Beans !!!! Also had the breakfast brioche sandwich for lunch.... AMAZING!!! Always friendly and yum yum yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"More than just a coffee shop. Light food, nice light in this corner location.   NB. They got their wifi!"}
{"text":"Yes. This place = a confident yes.   Just up the street from my house, Brickyards is a go-to for coffee and weekend brunch.  I'm pretty sure the only reason I can convince friends to come to the east end, is for the chicken waffle. Fact.   The service is always spot-on, the food consistently great. Everything is fresh and in abundance. Nothing over-salted (pet peeve) and I don't think there's one item on the menu that would disappoint.   Pleasant atmosphere, unpretentious, very family friendly, and a valued spot on the otherwise lacklustre Gerrard.   In conclusion, Yes x5. Go."}
{"text":"Welcome to the newly renovated Brickyard Grounds. First time back in this area in over 15 years. It has changed a lot!  This is a great location at the corner of Gerrard and Greenwood, it can be easily found there. When we went in it was 4 days since it opened after the renovation. Everything was new and looked really good we're excited to have our lunch.  Our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and provided a great service. The food was well made however it was not as distinctive or unique as I was expecting.  We ordered the pulled chicken waffle and a sandwich which was their most popular. Everything was fresh and tasty and well made.  Overall it was a good experience I was come back and try again and try more dishes the items itself was good portion but was not as large as other bunches."}
{"text":"We've only done breakfast here, but the breakfast sammies are awesome.  It's your standard egg, pea meal and cheeseburgers then you have to get them with everything which includes caramelised onions and chipotle mayo.  Paired with a mocha, and your hangover is gone!   Service is also quite friendly, especially the slightly grumpy barista that is actually not grumpy."}
{"text":"It's too soon for me to have a really informed opinion, but it's a promising start.  Some quick notes: - Friendly staff - Place looks great - SW Corner location is visible, convenient - No wifi yet (although it may well come) - I had a double espresso, and it was very nice - They have a rotisserie for chicken  It's also the closest café to my house, which definitely scores points for me."}
{"text":"Late entry: My first experience left me standing at the counter waiting for my sandwich while 3 others were served sandwiches after me.  It seems they forgot my order I place 2 minutes prior.  My second experience, I ordered and had a seat, drank my entire ciffee...never got a sandwich...I went back up to the counter to inquire, and it seems they had forgotten...Overall, subpar food, forgettable service."}
{"text":"This place is about as 5 star as you can expect from a coffee shop. Great Space, Great Staff, Great Atmosphere. I'm a regular here (almost daily T-F since they reopened) and it is always a reliably great experience. Good place to work or meet people over coffee.  Just a few great things I can say about this place: 1. Coffee - I believe its Rufino (sp.) and its a good blend. On par with other options in the area. 2. Latte's - Well prepared and generous enough in size.  3. Breakfast Sandwich - The Peameal Bacon Brioche is solid with Mayo and Onions. 4. Weekend Brunch - I've done it once, but the Savoury Chicken Waffle definitely delivered. Good vibe on weekends too. The place is packed.  5. Rotisserie Chicken - A good weekday take home dinner. I normally ask them to double on the Taragon Dijon sauce. Only disappointment has been that they sometimes sell out of the birds early.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I forgot how good a latte could be until our first visit today. Excellent brioche sandwich as well. Good thing this place is not close to home or work or I'd be visiting far too often. Nicely laid out with clean interesting decor. I like the large print of photo of the very corner from back in the 1920's or 30's. Person, who I assume is owner was also super nice and friendly. great job guys!"}
{"text":"Firstly, super excited to have some new spots open on Gerrard -- the sad cousin of Queen East. Better yet, the place looks great, and has been busy every time I'm in.  All in all, comfy seating, wifi, places to plug in your laptop, super duper friendly staff/owners - all pros!  Coffee is good, not the best in town compared to the true coffee shops, but VERY solid espresso drinks and they have almond milk (yay!)  Food is standout for a cafe like us... great sandwiches: grilled cheese, pulled pork, etc, meat pies (which seem to very popular as they were recently sold out!), tasty salads, roast chicken. They also now do weekend brunch with waffles, brioche, etc. Have yet to try, but given everything else is so good, I'm sure it will be just as great."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my gf a few weeks ago. Excellent place. The service was very good, the food tasted great - with a good selection for brunch - and the place looked very nice inside. I can see this becoming our go to brunch place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and the food was delicious but the service was horrible and I felt like  I was completely unwelcome here.   I was injured and was in crutches during my visit but no one came by to ask if I needed anything or if I wanted to order additional items. Service was practically nonexistent. I was finally able to get service, once I got up, walked to the counter and flagged down a waitress."}
{"text":"Cute neighbourhood cafe with traditional cafe fare (coffee, pastries, etc.) as well as sandwiches, poutine, and rotisserie chicken. Seems like an interesting mix of items but appears to work.   The coffee is good, the staff is friendly, the decor delightful. I had the vegan wrap, it was tasty and affordably priced.   It's nice to have a place like this in this neighbourhood. I suspect I'll become some sort of a regular."}
{"text":"Sadly, Yelp is saying that this little awesome gem is closed, but it's alive and serving up some great coffee and totally fab service! First time here, and certainly not my last.  Glad I noticed it and will return!"}
{"text":"I had been watching and waiting in anticipation for this place to open after my love for the neighbourhood Red Rocket had started to dwindle a little.   I stopped in on a Wednesday morning about a week after Brickyard Grounds first opened. The space is beautifully renovated and inviting. Somewhere you could grab a coffee and plop down with the morning paper or your laptop.  The wonderfully friendly owners, Sophie and Lefteris, were manning the shop that day so we were given a detailed overview of the cafe's offerings which included an arsenal of winter warm-up beverages (coffee, hot apple cider, hot chocolate) but also a full menu of sandwiches, salads, baked goods, etc. They also mentioned they will be offering rotisserie chicken to go for those wanting to pick up a quick meal for the family on a week night.  With the newly renovated Greenwood Park (swimming, playground, skating, off-leash dog park) next door they picked an ideal location to set up shop. I can see myself stopping here regularly on my way to the park with my dog and kid.  Oh, forgot to mention that I ordered a cappuccino, which was just perfect."}
{"text":"This place is really adorable! I'm going to make a point to come back here. The service was fast, helpful & friendly. My friend got a London fog with a sandwich/ salad combo. He really enjoyed his meal. I got a chia tea latte with almond milk. It was ok. VERY SWEET & I didn't add anything. I most likely won't get it again but I'm really interested in trying a latte next time I'm in. The atmosphere was my favourite thing tbh. I would love to come here to read a book, surf the web, people watch. It's really cozy but bright. Looked to be very clean. I LOVED that they decorated for fall/Halloween. I want to come see what they do for the holidays. I'll keep us updated Yelp!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and simple, delicious food. Seating is limited and the place tends to attract a lot of families with kids."}
{"text":"My morning coffee place, I have almost daily customer since the place open one year ago. Friendly staff and good food especially the weekend bruches."}
{"text":"Amazing service, the waiter was super attentive and friendly.  We had their Brickyard Chicken and Waffles and Classic Cameron. I really liked my plate of Montreal smoked meats, poached eggs (two eggs any style), fries, kale mix and fruit. The only thing I was not a fan of was their home made ketchup, it was \"alive\" because fermentation like bubbles would form whenever I dip a fry into it. As for the chicken and waffles, my husband said overall it was good but nothing too special, but I normally don't like gravy and I liked it.  Overall if this place was closer to our hood, it would become one of our go-to spots. Because their coffees were good and their service was pretty perfect."}
{"text":"I just bought a house in the neighborhood and had locked myself out of the house so i stopped at this amazing place while waiting for my sister to bring my keys. I'll start with a WOW! class all the way, when I first walked in I felt little out of place cause I was in my home clothes and feeling very haggard but once I talked to the staff I felt so comfortable and at home. Not very often do you find a classy cafe that doesn't have a snobbish feel to it. THE FOOD oh wow!! had the pulled chicken sandwich and it is literally the best sandwich I ever had when I expressed that to the waiter the ladies next to me also raved about their sandwich. I was having a rough day with no keys no phone and no wallet (just had my credit card) but this cafe turned my day around and it will forever be my go to spot..I can't wait till i bring my sister and friends over ...so happy i found it :))))"}
{"text":"Lovely and friendly spot, great food and brunch waffles looked amazing ( sold out by time we got there at 2). We tried the Reuben, veggie brioche, baked beans, pulled chicken sandwich and grilled cheese with variety of salads and apple cider. Amazing! :)"}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to eat here after going to the Buddhist temple that's across from it. It's very quaint. The decor just works very well together.  I decided on getting the brickyard chicken, which comes on a savory waffle. I was a little disappointed when the cashier told me they didn't have it. But, to my delight they had a Thanksgiving version instead. It came with a savory waffle topped with mashed potatoes, turkey, gravy, and a cranberry sauce. It was amazing. It sounded weird but once I tried it I knew I made the right decision. All the flavours just worked really well together and the waffle was perfectly fluffy.  My brother got the double rotisserie chicken legs combo with a Caesar salad. I had a bit of his chicken and it was super tasty. Very succulent. He had it with a housemade honey mustard sauce. He said he liked it.  This place is a bit on the pricey side. But so far everything is worth the price."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and it was just as good as the first time! You can find my first review here (they changed Yelp URLs): https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brickyard-grounds-toronto  My brother and I came in here around 11:15AM on Saturday and the place was decently busy. I don't blame the other patrons because it's a great place for brunch! My brother and I were seated by a waitress, but I think we could have seated ourselves and a waiter would have come by. We also had the option of ordering at the till and getting it to our table I believe.  The waitress who seated us gave menus and when we asked for waters she said she would get them for us but she never returned... I believe she was working the front section but still would have been nice for her to quickly hand us two glasses of waters. Our actual waiter eventually came by after 5-7 minutes and apologized for the wait.  I ordered the eggs Benedict over waffles with assorted fruit, side kale salad, baked beans, and a sausage. I can't recall the actual name of the dish. Overall it was pretty tasty! I was a little disappointed as the hollandaise sauce didn't have any zip to it. The kale salad was also drenched in dressing and only had about 40% kale. The sausage though was well seasoned and was delicious.  My brother got a pulled chicken with Montreal smoked meat waffle that came with fries. We both got a London fog each and it was so good. The cup was huge and we weren't able to finish drinking them since we were full from our food so we got the rest to go.  I love going to this place and will most definitely head back here again."}
