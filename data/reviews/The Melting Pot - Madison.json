{"text":"very expensive for what you get. Also, not sure if this review will show up as YELP seems to remove bad reviews, for a price. Was not impressed with this place. service was slow, food was just ok, nothing special"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service. Especially on the girls who are \"greeting\" at the doors. So rude, even if the food was good.. I will not eat there. We turned around and walked out last night and have never been treated with such attitude in our lives by hostesses."}
{"text":"It was fun. If you're looking for fondue in Madison you could do worse (well, not really...I am actually not so sure you could do at all!). The portions are quite large, so if it's just two of you, I think you probably won't want to eat all of the courses or at least plan to leave a bit behind every time. I know we did and I was still pretty full at the end. After all, who is going to say no to using up all of the melted chocolate at the end???!!!"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my promotion and had the worst service , and average food . server was missing in action and had to ask other servers for refills and things we needed. 2 hours later and only cheese and meat course done , 20 min pass and no dessert course . Finally asked for the bill and no apologies of any kind, they offered to let us take dessert course home but no compensation given for our experience. $141 later , save your $. Will never go there again, so disappointed"}
{"text":"Pricey! It was my husband's birthday and he loves fondue. We went w/o rev. Had to wait for half an hour at the bar. The bartendee did not know  Caparinha so i ordered Mojito, not an original but a kind that add berries. It was suck! Lol, it was not her fault. I shld hv sticked to the original.  At the table, the only traditional cheese fondue is \"classic alpine\". It was delicious. We also ordered cheddar. It was rather disappointing.   The last one was lobster tail. It was ok. Nothing fancy.  I agree with some other comments about the price and portion. It was too little compare to its price.   The staff was friendly but each dish take to long to come.   To me, nothing excited me cuz i also can cook everything they have at home, only i do not have fancy plates and pot.   My recommendation is sticking to only the fondue."}
{"text":"Had a great birthday dinner here.  It's a splurge but I had a Groupon that made it doable.  We had a great server and the manager was very friendly.  Meat quality seems to be mentioned in every review.  I'm a picky foodie; at home I cook from scratch with good quality local, organic, grass-fed beef, organic happy chickens, etc.  The meat we were served was good quality and sliced well for fondue dipping.  Were I to guess I'd say USDA choice.  It's lean meat though, and from mostly from mild cuts that aren't very tough to begin with and won't toughen up if you leave them in the pot for too long.  So you really want to use the sauces they provide.  Also ask for salt and salt your meat before cooking.  What I really liked was how food-sensitivity/allergy friendly they are.  One of my dining companions has multiple food sensitivities and both the server and manager were awesome in making sure that we ordered properly.  The whole restaurant seems very well set up for protecting against cross contamination.  I also asked about gluten-free dining if only one person in a small party was GF and the rest of the table wanted to eat gluten.  They said the best thing to do is to make a reservation 3-4 days out and let them know that you'll need to be seated at a table with 2 burners so that one person can have a pot that doesn't get cross-contaminated."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty.  The service was acceptable.  The building itself was quite nice.  The biggest problem is the prices are astronomical and the portions a bit small.  I was here for a party of eight people and the final tab was over 650 dollars and nobody drank alcohol.  We got starters, main course, and desserts.  If they increase portion size or cut about 40% off the prices, I would go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing experience. I experienced poor service by any restaurant standard, but down right awful compared to restaurants at a similar price point. I had a reservation for 2 people at 9 pm and showed up at 8:45 pm, the hostess said it'll just be a minute and directed us to the bar. While we at the bar another couple who came after us who did NOT have a reservation gets offered a table before us. Another couple who originally had the intention to eat at the bar was also offered a table before us. Around 9:20 pm (20 min after our reservation time) the bartender approaches the hostess then the hostess finally offers us a table. She claims the other hostess got us confused with another couple. Nobody ultimately took accountability for situation or offered us anything that made it seem like they cared. Anyways, the waitress was extremely nosey and asking way too many personal questions. AFTER we paid our bill and were on the way out, the bartender approaches us and says he forgot to transfer our drinks to our table and he needs to see our card to run it again. Everything was so sloppy and uncoordinated about the whole experience. I won't comment on the price of the food, everyone seems to accept they are overly expensive. Anyway, I tipped my 20% and decided I would never come back. I will never go the Melting Pot again and will continue to share this experience with everyone I know until I die. When I say everyone, I mean everyone."}
{"text":"We love MP.  We've been coming here regularly for about three years.  The place is fantastic.  Cost:  You do need to get over sticker shock when you see their prices,  BUT if you look at what you get, it is not exorbitant at all.  The Big Night Out currently costs $80-$120 depending on how much lobster and shrimp you want.  This feeds 2-4 depending on your appetite.  We go with four and we're stuffed.  When we go with two, several courses end up in the to-go box.  That comes out to $20-$30 per person for a four course meal.  Not expensive when you look at it that way but you still do have to pay the total amount.  Food:  YUM...DELICIOUS!!! The first course is the cheese fondue.  They have several options as well as their featured cheese which rotates every six months.  We like the swiss based ones better.  The cheddar based one are almost too cheddary.  We've been told that they use only local products and adjust according to regional taste.  That may explain the strength of the cheddar since it's popular in WI.  With the cheese you get unlimited apple pieces, cauliflower, carrots, celery, and white and brown bread.  I love the apples best.  Salad:  The salads are very upscale and, IMO, the best in Madison.  They're fresh and unusual without being too bizarre.  As with the cheese they have several on the menu all the time and one that changes every six months.    Main Course: Depending on which one you select, you get a selection of chicken, pork, sirloin, filet mignon, salmon, shrimp, tuna, ravioli or potstickers, and lobster.  The meat is cut into roughly one inch pieces and trimmed of all fat.  (Thank you!  I hate fat on meat.)  After that you cook it at the table in a fondue pot filled with broth or oil.  They have three choices of broth.  The basic one is blah.  Skip it.  The mojo has citrus added and since, I'm not a citrus fan, I avoid this one unless I select an entree that matches it.  The Coq au Vin has herbs, mushrooms, scallions, and burgundy added and it's phenomenal.  The oil is one of the healthier oils and it comes with two different types of batter for coating.  Everything come out good but it's still deep fried and/or battered.  Try this one on your second or third visit.  It's worth doing once a year although this is not a good option for when kids are around.  Dessert:  Everyone's favorite except mine.  :P  I'm not a chocoholic.  They have three types of chocolate-dark, milk, and white.  The white is very sweet while the other two are very deep and rich in flavor.  They have a lot of decadent options-chocolate peanut butter, cookies and cream, flaming turtle, amaretto. and YinYang, which has both dark and light chocolate.  As with the cheese and salads, there is one featured chocolate which changes every six months.  You can also build your own-pick the chocolate and some flavored alcohol.  They mix it up, light it, and serve it to you.  To dip you get strawberries, bananas, marshmallows, brownies, pound cake, and cheesecake.  None of these are unlimited but by the time you get to desert, you are so stuffed that it doesn't matter.  The server usually asks if you want one or two more at the end and they'll bring you extras if you want.  Service:  For the most part, everyone who works at MP is warm, friendly, and very nice.  I think two-ish years ago was the only time we got a bitchy waiter.  He's gone!  They do tend to follow a script but it's kinda fun to ask them questions...but what OTHER combination do YOU like.  *snicker*.  The majority are college kids and it's been a joy and pleasure to get to know them over the years.  Drinks:  Extensive, huge wine collection but since I don't drink wine, I can't comment much.  They have a full bar and can pretty much make any mixed drink you want.  Their chocolate based martinis rock the house.  They have a 'large' martini which is not advertised and is $25 dollars regardless of what they put in it.  It's huge.  Four people can share!!  Their other drinks run $7-9.  They will also create special drinks just for you.  (There's a martini with my name on it in their computer system!)  Tell them what you like and that you want to be surprised.  You will be pleasantly surprised.  Specials:  They have specials every night except Friday and Saturday.  We go on Sunday because they offer a free kids plate with the adult meal.  They also have \"prix fixe\" holiday specials.  These are uber-fun.  They usually cook things that you will never see on the menu.  New Year's Eve is an awesome one because they give you champagne and the glass as well as party favors like free chocolate or a bottle of their salad dressing!  Overall...definitely worth visiting.  The food is delicious and the experience is fun!  Plan on being there 2-3 hours BTW.  While you do get what you pay for, you still do have to pay a substantial amount."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  This is the first time we have been to this location.  First the atmosphere is much brighter than most not really romantic at all.  We came in for dessert only.  The server didn't seem like she knew what she was doing.  My wife ordered a cappuccino.  The waitress told us the machine didn't work.  So she and I both got a cup of coffee.  I will admit I am a coffee snob and I wasn't expecting the best cup of coffee but I would like a decent cup.  It tasted off, I asked the waitress if the coffee sat on a hot plate and she looked at me like I had a third eye.  I told her it tasted scorched.  She said I can get you another cup all I do is push the button.  (Coffee concentrate!). There is no excuse not to brew a real pot of coffee.  Our fondue came to the table already melted and she flambéed it table side.  We ordered an enhanced dipper plate and didn't receive it.  The dippers were just ok most of them were pre made.  The dessert alone was $17.00.  I have no problem paying good money for good food.  This was no where near good food.  Before we finished eating be server brought the bill and never asked if we wanted more coffee.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for a meal. The only thing that is good is the cheese and chocolate. You have to boil chunks of unseasoned meat for your entree. Sound appetizing? I was very disappointed knowing that you can't get much for under 40 dollars if you want to have a meal."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks.  This coming from somebody who is easily pleased while dining out.   I recently went again after trying it a number of years ago.   Same experience.  But hey, if you really enjoy a condescending wait staff, a piece of dried out bread with cheese, 3 oz of steak, 2 oz of chicken, and 1/2 of a rice crispy treat that is cut into 8 tiny pieces with some chocolate, all of which is to be split between 2 people for $80+ this is definitely your place!  It's the ultimate rip off.  I can't believe I went back.  I'm a fool.  And to the review claiming it's about \"the experience\" and people complaining about the price \"don't get it\", you're right.  I don't get it.   I'm not sure about others, but no experience at the melting pot could possibly make me feel content with paying $80 for $6.50 worth of food.   Sorry.     I'd suggest Granite City if you're trying to find places in the area, or the McDonalds next door."}
{"text":"Sooo...how do I begin this.   We have never been to this place before but always wanted to try it.  I ended finding a  Groupon and decided to try it out and see what all the fuss was about.  We made reservations for lunch because that was a requirement to use the Groupon. Once we got there we were quickly taken to our table  the restaurant was pretty empty aside for maybe 3 other couples....yet we were stuck in some dark corner (all curtains were close, atmosphere purposes I guess), we we were the only ones in these area of the restaurant  Anyway once our server arrive she didn't seem friendly. We explained that this was our first time and were not sure how it worked and showed her our Groupon.  This girl was not nice and helpful at all.  She didn't really explained much and just told us \"pick 3 of these\" and left.  The 5 of us decided on 3 meats and when she came back I told her which 3. Well it turns out that it was 3 per person. She left again and we each made our decision and put our order in.  Some time later she came back with our plates and 2 bowls of vegetables (we were surprised because we didn't know these came with the meal). Then left again. We put our skewers in the pot and were wondering how long it will take to cook and such, so we kept checking the meats to make sure it didn't overcook.  The girl came back some time later carrying some sauces (surprised again) and by this time we have already started eating our food and vegetables. At that point we asked her how long we needed to leave our food in the pots and found that we did leave our food longer than expected but that was okay.   To wrap things up, we were  not impress, we were not happy with the service because the waitress was not nice and made us feel like she was doing us a favor by serving us.  She was the worst part of the experience from beginning to end and just made everything else awful and not enjoyable.   Needless to say I don't think we will be returning.    PS: Servings are very small so we were left hungry as well."}
{"text":"We went here as a special dinner.  It was pricey,but in the end we felt like we ate a huge meal. I was leery about cooking my veg in the same pot raw chicken was cooking in, but I guess it's ok because they didn't bring a separate pot for meat and veg. I am confused about the fact the we ordered two four course meals but we given an app and a desert to \"share\". Each four course meal was supposed to come with an app and a desert. Maybe that's just the way it is. I didn't think about that until after. That we each paid for an app and desert, but one came to the table, and we couldn't each pick what we wanted, it had to be a compromise. Well, then why did I pay for a four course?  Tech it's a partially shared four course.They have a special drink menu. My drink was disappointing. I ordered a mojito. Yuk. Then ordered their long island...and it was a long island. Nothing special, so I really didn't understand the drink prices. Our waiter was a good one.  Very tasty food. But give yourself a lot of time. It took forever for us to complete our four course meal. Which we weren't prepared for. Next time we will go earlier. And you may want to make reservations. The parking lot was packed when we arrived. And upon entering were told there would be a little wait. But when we walked into the dining area there were tons of seats and the entire bar was empty, so we still are confused by the wait. But it is a nice place but more for like special as I don't know who could afford to eat there on a daily basis."}
{"text":"The melting pot is definitely one of my favorite places to go for a girls night! We usually stick to the cheese and chocolate fondue. The cheese is always my favorite part and it comes with bread, apples, and veggies. The food is delicious but the service can definitely be better. Last night it took an hour for a bottle of wine to be served and to get started with our first pot of cheese. We had to ask for our server a couple of times. I was disappointed on the long wait especially when tables around us that arrived later ate and left before us. I will definitely go back and hopefully our service will be better."}
{"text":"The melting pot is a fun once-in-a-while experience. It's very social and people who have been here before get to feel like they're showing newbies something, which gives you something extra to chat about.  However, it is no culinary feat by any means. Melt cheese + dipped bread = yummy. Melt chocolate + dipped marshmallow = yummy. Duh.   I've been here for the discounted ladies night and a bachelorette party where they gave use a huge discount too. I can't imagine paying $80 for a couple here, but I guess people do. When folks pay full price for a full meal, the melting pot is laughing all the way to the bank. I think a lot of people who are big fans get in on their discount club thing.  The service is SLOW, which can be nice or annoying depending on the type of experience you want."}
{"text":"I would probably rate this place higher if not for the price. Holy cow, is it expensive to eat here! I was here for a bachelorette party this past weekend and spend $50 just on myself...definitely not in the small budget I have.   The food was pretty good, as was the service (minus the 20 minutes we waited to get our chocolate dessert fondues). They have a special \"bridal shower menu\" where you get a cheese fondue, salad, petite fondue and chocolate fondue for $25 each. There were 2 tables of ladies, and each table had 2 pots so we got to try a lot. For cheese we had the fiesta, Wisconsin trio, Melting Pot cheddar cheese, and spinach artichoke. My favorite was the Wisconsin trio - it's so yummy with green apples.   I think we sampled each salad between us all. I chose the Spinach mushroom salad. It was good, but would've been so much better with a warm dressing. I didn't really hear any complaints about anyone else's salad. The entrees were yummy as well. Mine came with small portions of chicken, shrimp and steak. One woman at our table was served a shrimp that had not been deveined yet, but the restaurant made up for it by giving her 5 extra to replace the 1. The broth you cook the meat in is super yummy and smells so good. The sauces they come with are pretty good too, there's so many of them you're bound to find one you like.  Then for the dessert. This was my favorite part (obviously). Between us all we had the s'mores, regular, and dark chocolate dulce de leche. They were all delish!   Like I said, save for the atrocious price, I would definitely rate this place higher. While you are served a lot of food, it's just out of the budget for a regular night out."}
{"text":"For a place called The Melting Pot: A Fondue Restaurant, I was shocked to discover how little of a section they had for fondue! They really just want you to get that as an appetizer and get their $20-30/plate meals. We wanted the fondue experience and got the cheese fondue which came with bread & veggies. But still had to order more, which luckily they had an Italian meat selection. Not a bad experience (we had a private booth in \"lovers lane\"), but a little disappointing for a \"fondue\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Cheese and chocolate + things to dip in them? Sign me up!   A longtime fondue fan, this place was PERFECT for my recent bachelorette night. It worked for the meat-eaters, the vegetarians, the bird-like eaters, and the food-shovellers. Yummy food, a fun environment and a really great set of waitresses! I love it here!"}
{"text":"First fondue experience.  Could have used a little more instruction but it was fun.  I think it would be a great place for a double date, or with just a couple friends.  I usually dislike to see a premium on food you cook yourself, but this wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Melting Pot is one of my favorite places to dine.  Yes, it's a little pricey but you pay for the experience!  My husband and I went for restaurant week because of the different items offered. We added the cheese course (loaded baked potato) and it was amazing!  Next up were the incredible Caesar salads (love the pine nuts!).  We both enjoyed our entrees and appreciated the fact that we could upgrade to the coq a vin cooking broth for no additional charge.  The coconut rum chocolate fondue for dessert was tasty, but my favorite is still the smores!  Our server Lacey was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"We went for $5 cheese and chocolate night. I never knew. I was able to grab a seat at the bar and the bartenders were really busy. They managed to squeeze our order in between the demand for all the alcohol. I didnt appreciate the alpine cheese mix, it lacked salt or spice. Couldn't decide which. The premium meats helped with the taste. If you aren't too hungry splitting the cheese and chocolate with another person makes it loght on the pocketbook and tasty. Or allow you to splurge on alcohol."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just a person who's just not crazy about cheese dip. I think one or two appetizers with special cheesy melts are great, but not when you have three courses of bread dipping cheese melt, vegetable dipping cheese melt, and meat dipping cheese melt. Honestly, I think the bread and cheese dip is great and maybe the vegetables and cheese, but I'd much rather have quality meat on its own (I don't think Melting Pot's meat is that quality though). Chocolate fondue is great too, but that's something you can make at home. Just melt a Hershey's chocolate bar and dip fruit or crackers into it.  Service is great at the Melting Pot and the fondue concept is neat, but the food is just meh."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because I've had good experiences in the past. However, the last time we came the service was terrible and very slow. First, we asked for more apples to dip in our cheese, and it took so long to come that by the time it arrived we had finished our cheese. Next, we asked for more veggies and 25 minutes later they still hadn't arrived. Our server came over and simple said \"oh, you haven't gotten your veggies yet?\" No apologies or anything. The overall experience wasn't good, and it took a very long time for everything. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for my bachelorette party and had a great experience- Sam went above and beyond to make it a wonderful evening. Food was great and Sam made the day even more special. I look forward to another great experience soon."}
{"text":"Melting Pot is an awesome place to eat. You need to have time to eat, it will take a couple of hours, take your time and enjoy the experience. With the choices you have with food and cooking style it's great. The ambience in the restaurant is a warm glow. You need to visit at least once, to have a great time."}
{"text":"\"A once in a lifetime experience...that I re-live each month I go there.\" I love the Melting Pot. I will be honest, it is quite pricey, but it's somewhere you got for a special occasion or on a date. Its cosy and romantic, plus the whole experience is fun. I love the fiesta cheese, house salad and the yin yang desert (best of both worlds). It takes about 2 hours and then some to dine there, so it's a night out all together. You will feel stuffed after your done, my boyfriend always thinks it's \"not that much food,\" but he is always full after the 2nd course! But don't think you won't be able to save room for desert, I always feel that I will be too full, but you will get a second wind once the strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, pound cake and marshmallows come out to your table. Almost forgot, we always have great service, it's part of the whole experience, but we always have great conversations with the servers."}
{"text":"Another disappointing event at the Melting Pot. This time we didn't even make it through the cheese coarse before we had to excuse ourselves. One positive is that Haley are server was excellent. The rest of the experience was less than desireable. We made a complaint about our cheese coarse and the manager came over and started out almost accusing us that the cheese was overheated. Which I would understand if IT was not cold. Plus it was really thick almost like a bread dough.  Then the manager used our utensils to test the cheese. Are you kidding me. At this point it is time to move on. Then as we exit the hostess didn't even acknowledge us leaving. Talk about icing on the cake. I will not be back. To many disappointments."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot and I have had a long love story.  Most of the time it seems like a Lifetime story.    I have been a fan of fondue for several years.  While it tends to be more of a special occasion rather than casual occurrence, we have gone twice in the past 3 months.  The first time was in April.  I had been to several Melting Pots before.  I have never been overly impressed by this one in Madison but my husband and I decided to go last April.  Terrible decision.  Apparently, it was THE night to go!  We had 6 o'clock reservations.  We arrived a couple of minutes early.  We waited nearly ten minutes to get seated, all the while walk-in groups and couples were being seated.    I had to make a point to remind them that we had reservations.  When they finally got around to seating, we were once again seated in an area with \"couple\" types seats.  They are small, awkward and we specifically requested not to be seated there.  However, that was all that available (though we had a reservation).  It is so weird to sit next a person.  This was not our first date.  I was not hear to kiss and cuddle.  I am there to have dinner.    The service took so long.  They were clearly understaffed.  However, it got to the point where we were waiting twenty minutes between each course.  I was so turned off by this experience.  On this occasion we went because we had a Groupon so we decided to make a special trip.  We were applied automatic gratuity.  Now, I am a good tipper and if I want to tip 18% for terrible service, I would.  However, I did not want to do this and was extremely upset by this.  Upon returning home, I immediately contacted this location.  I received no response and two weeks later sent another email.  FINALLY, I received a call from a manager.  I did not want anything free, I just wanted acknowledgement.  They were attentive but at the same time really could not care.  Without asking, they sent us a dip certificate.    So my husband and I decided to go again.  Just give them the benefit of the doubt.  This time the service was a complete 180!  The hostess was talkative and friendly.  The waiter was prompt and on-time.  We were stuck, again, in those terrible booths.  However, the service was so much better.  I am not sure if I will go again.  Honestly, the service is just not as good as other locations that I have experienced.  I feel better about this experience but it does not have the same class level as other locations.    The manager on duty did give us a complimentary box of strawberries for our anniversary.  This visit got a 5, the first got a 1.  Therefore, let's average it out at a 3."}
{"text":"Nice idea but not so great if you're vegetarian. Wasn't keen on the wine list. Wasn't keen on the non-meat options. Felt somewhat grimy to me."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  The food experience was perfect and the service was even better. I would highly recommend this place to all of my Wisconsin friends.   I have never done fondue before and it was a spiritual experience that your server walked us through like an angel."}
{"text":"Unfortunately another poor experience at this location. Our server was pleasant even though it took 35 minutes to get our first course. Once the cheese course did arrive the pot was so cold that the cheese wouldn't melt to even warm up. The manager stated the cheese had been cooked too long even though the shredded cheese hadn't even melted. We weren't going to complain to get the service customers deserve, we got up and left with our family disappointed for a night out celebrating a big event. Sorry Melting Pot...burnt us once too many times."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with fondue, and it was a lot of fun. The staff Is very knowledgeable and will walk you through all the steps you need to know. The fondue dishes are very good and the entree dipping sauces just enhance the flavor. Then the dessert comes, and all I can say is awesome. They also have a wide selection of wine including one of the best bottles I have ever had. You definitely need to try this dining experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Never disappointed. A little more expensive then I like to spend so I don't get to go much. But you never leave hungry.  I don't think id ever go unless I had a coupon but when I do I try to find a way to go.  Staff has been friendly in all visits."}
{"text":"So I've had a few great experiences at the Melting Pot, and I do have to say I always enjoy a good fondue. This is a great special occasion/date place and heads up...a little pricey.  I was leaning towards a 3 star rating, but because of the exceptional service I received from the Manager on duty \"Danielle\" I bumped it up to a 4 star rating for my overall experience.  I enjoyed that \"Danielle\" came around to my table and asked how everything was and if we were on a special occasion, I replied yes (since we were), and later after dessert she stopped back at our table and gave us 3 large chocolate covered strawberries to go, on the house as a \"congrats on your special occasion\".  I appreciate that! That is grade A+ service.   My favorite part of the Melting Pot is the dessert. In all honesty I enjoy going just for bread/cheese and dessert. It's just the right amount of food to still feel full after leaving here.  Just a tip----I've found out that if you do not have enough dipping vegetables, bread, or desserts and still have fondue left, you are able to ask for a few more dipping items usually free of charge.  Also, if you ever feel like tortilla chips with your bread/veg cheese fondue, just ask and they will bring you out some. I enjoy this with the fiesta fondue."}
{"text":"Two friends and I have been regulars of the Melting Pot Madison for the Monday Night special \"Ladies Night\" -often bringing in larger groups, for the past few years-so, having not gone since last winter, we decided it was time to return last Monday night. We noticed right away that we didn't see any of the usual servers or bartenders and that \"our\" server seemed less than pleasant, something that was NOT the norm from our prior visits. When our cheese arrived, we noticed that the dishes were different, and that broccoli was not on the plates to dip-but we thought that perhaps they were out. When our salads arrived, they were smaller than we remembered them being. We decided to also add the entree portion (not included in Ladies Night pricing) and when the vegetables arrived-there was broccoli! (assuming that in order to cut food costs, the broccoli was omitted from Ladies Night) We finished our meal with the chocolate fondue-all along commenting that none of the servers seemed happy and that our server, while it appeared she only had ours and one other table, was never around-we waited for refills of water as well as drinks-which seemed very unusual to our past experiences when someone seemed to always be around to fill waters (which was not a server-assuming it was another cut back by MP)  At the conclusion of our meal, we took out a Groupon valued at $49 (which was what we paid for it, as the Groupon special had expired, however according to Groupon , expired Groupons can always be used for the face value of which was paid for them)  We had read the rules pertaining to Groupon before presenting it, as it seemed fairly easy-however, the server took one look at it and said \"you have to get what you bought it for!\"...we explained that the deal was expired and now the Groupon was only good for the purchase price, not the $98 value it had once had.  She very reluctantly wrote the information down and left, returning only a few minutes later to say that her manager verified that the Groupon could not be used.  When we asked her to explain why, she staggered and stammered and asked if we would like to speak to the manager...which we did, if only to better understand why the Groupon couldn't be used. The server returned a few minutes later-placing the bill on the table and said \"the manager took your Groupon even though we aren't supposed to!\" and left.  So, no better explanation to why the Groupon couldn't be used and more attitudes from our server and the manager didn't think we were worth a visit to help us to understand...NOT what we wanted! We would have happily paid for our meals without the Groupon; all we had asked for was someone who knew WHY the Groupon couldn't be used to explain it to us so we knew HOW to use it. I thought that Melting Pot should know of our experience and how embarrassing and unprofessional our visit was and how this was so unusual, based on the numerous times that we had gone there. I received a reply last night and I did finally have an answer as to the Groupon policy from Owners David & Terri Lenz, followed by the comment that \"I viewed these rules differently than other guests who have purchased them.\" (I am assuming that makes me less intelligent than every other person who purchased them??)   Ok, so I asked for an explanation-and I got it, but what WAS NOT in my reply email from them was anything about our treatment by their server or manager. I responded to David & Terri Lenz this morning, making sure that knew that Madison is full of quality restaurants with professional servers, managers and owners and that I will never go to Madison Melting Pot again-it has never been about the amazing food there (it's fondue!), but rather the amazing treatment and fun that used to be protocol for their customers-and based on the fact that Ladies Night used to be packed full and reservations nearly impossible, I did find it interesting that I was able to make same day reservations and when while there I also found it strange that so many tables sat empty-I think that MP has made some very poor decisions in staff changes, in food quantity changes and has alienated more former loyal customers than just me! If they were smart, they would go back to doing it the way it used to be :("}
{"text":"This place isn't what it is all hyped up to be. I've been here 2 times total. The first time was when my boyfriend took me and had set up their special romance package ahead of time. That includes a dozen roses, Champagne and two flute glasses, four-course Big Night Out® meal, picture in a pewter frame, private booth for two with curtains for $150.  Though I do not believe there were any roses and we did not get a picture in a pewter frame either. We did enjoy their cheese fondue (we chose the spinach and artichoke). Their wedge salad wasn't anything special.  Our least favorite parts of the 4-course meal was the entrée. They give you 4-5 different meats that you cook for yourself in the pot if boiling water in the middle of your table. Each item cooks at different lengths, which my boyfriend disliked because the instructions were long and confusing. After we'd cooked all the meat and eaten we were very disappointed. There was hardly any flavor to it unless you dipped it in one of the 8 sauces they give you.  The dessert was our favorite part of the meal, though we wouldn't go as far as to say it was phenomenal by any means.  All in all this experience was not worth the price tag. My most recent visit was for their \"Girls Night Out\" on Mondays. Food-wise the experience was the same but the price was better! And the best of all was their signature drinks. I would go back for their martini's, though they aren't strong they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for Girls Night Out(which is offered only on Mondays) because everyone I've talked to said that the best items at TMP were the cheese fondue and the dessert, and that the entree is nothing special(takes a LONG time to cook the meat, for instance). Girls Night Out offers the cheese fondue, a salad, and dessert fondue for only $16 per person which is pretty darned reasonable, considering the price of a full meal(which can range from $80-90 per couple for all five courses). Specialty drinks are $5 this night, as well(although I wasn't in love with either of the two I tried).   We had the Wisconsin Trio for the cheese, which was okay...but nothing fabulous. My friend said that they had the Cheddar Cheese last time, and it was lackluster. I had a nice salad, but nothing I couldn't do at home. We chose the Original chocolate for dessert(a mix of milk chocolate and peanut butter). This was good, but when ISN'T melted chocolate yummy? I do wish that they had given us more fresh fruit and less desserty-stuff to dip. It's not like the picture on the website where it's a heap of bright fruits. There were four small banana slices and about 2-3 strawberries sliced. The rest was pound cake, brownie, marshmallow, rice crispy treat, etc...   All in all, it was a fun evening, but nothing overly-delicious. I would do Girls Night again mostly for female bonding time, and not the food.  They seem to have a special for every night, so check the website. Also book ahead. I called three weeks in advance and they had THREE times left open."}
{"text":"We didn't have a reservation but the manager found a table for us in the bar and accommodated our party of 4.  Server was attentive and patient with our inability to understand the menu and was quick with drinks.  Food was great and it was such a fun experience with friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose the Melting Pot for \"Date Night\" and had a wonderful meal, though it was not without room for improvement. The hostess greeted us warmly, but we still had to wait until 10 minutes after our reservation time to receive a table. Our waiter was very friendly, though if we asked questions that were not on his training script, he seemed a bit lost. We ordered a cheese fondue and shared an entree and the accompanying salad. We planned to order dessert but were simply too full. The cheddar cheese fondue was tasty. However, it promised swiss and cheddar, but was quite skewed towards the cheddar. Wine would have made a better ingredient than the beer they use. The house salad with Tangy Sweet dressing was flavorful and fresh. Our entree - the Pacific Rim - offered pork, beef, chicken, shrimp, pot stickers, and even duck. The wide variety of batters and sauces made for nearly infinite combination possibilities.  I hope I can remember next time that I did enjoy the beef by far the best. If the management put their waitstaff in collared shirts they likely could achieve the level of elegance that the decor strives for; the long-sleeved T-shirts seem out of place. The men's bathroom was filthy - a slight step above Interstate rest-stop. Despite these minor flaws, we never felt rushed in the nearly 3 hours we spent here and the fondue seemed to engender continuous conversation. We will most certainly return."}
{"text":"Fun experience, but on the spendy side. This will likely be my one and only visit.  After years of curiosity, I bought a Groupon, and decided that now was the time.  While the food was pretty good (for the most part) and fun to watch, the simplicity of the whole thing really gets revealed.  I kept thinking, I could totally do this at home and probably better (and less expensive)....  What I tried: Quattro Formaggio cheese fondue- very flavorful with tomato and basil pesto (served with bread, cauliflower, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and apples)  The California Salad- loads of toppings. A little too much dressing, I would recommend asking for it on the side.  Fondue for You- burgundy/vegetable broth Meats chosen: filet, pepper bacon filet, shrimp, salmon, tuna (very low quality, it was quite fishy, and not very tender even when cooked to medium rare) Served with 6 sauces (this probably change)- green goddess*, teriyaki*, sweet and sour*, curry, cocktail, weird mayonase base one. *I only liked these three.  While I don't mind paying for good food and a good experience, this fell short for me. It was fun, but not worthy of a return visit."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying we went to this location on 2/14/2009 and haven't returned for good reason. I decided to write about it after seeing several people had issues with the waitstaff~  The waiter knew nothing of the special that I wanted to purchase. After I explained the whole buy a gift card get a gift card email notice that I received - he left our table, returned and said that was not a special. Paid for our ticket...and oopsie... the special notice was included on the jacket sleeve. I paid and left. Thinking to myself: this is why we should've went to the one of the locations in Chicagoland just not Madtown.   I emailed or called and a manger did follow up. His resolution was not, let me refund your dinner price and please buy the gift card or we'll provide you with what you were looking for @ no charge. It was, \"I'm sorry he wasn't aware of the advertisement.\" We hung up with nothing else to say. I should've went directly to a manager that day but I was trying not ruin a lovely Valentine's for the kid as she was excited not to have the kid's menu. in her words, \"I feel like a teenager!\"   It's been over 2 years and I'll tell you - you are NOT missing anything. The seasoning for the food didn't permeate the meats so ultimately - we had seafood dipped in butter and we were eating (and enjoying) the hot butter more than the meal. Lovely decor. And I'm glad they offer different cost-effective nights but skip it and head over to Ginza (of Tokyo).   End cost: 1 adult, 1child - $65. Water for me, Sprite for the kid. Got the trio deal and tipped. Prime Quarter is better if you want to hang with friends. HuHot or Ginza."}
{"text":"On Thursday night we walked out without having been greeted for 15 minutes.  The next night we came back with a reservation and did get seated in good time.   The waitress and her trainee prepared our cheese fondue on our small table with elbows inches from our face for a long time. It was pretty invasive to a romantic evening. I wish they would have prepared it in the kitchen.  The cheese fondue wasn't enough for us. It was clearly meant to be a first course before doing meat fondue, but we weren't having that. I wish they had an entree portion of the cheese.  The items you dip in the cheese are naked and in your face on plates. So they really need to be flawless. No blemishes, perfectly fresh, and that's exactly what they were. Well done, I know that's difficult/expensive.  The chocolate fondue was too big for us. Thankfully it was prepared in the kitchen, but the waitress left a hot water bath in front of us ready for the chocolate, full of very dirty reused water. I know it wasn't going to touch our chocolate, but it was a little off-putting. Why not just rinse it out first?  Three stars for perfect food, minus two stars for all the assorted weirdness."}
{"text":"The best waiters is the one who Profesional and nice / pleasant. The worst- not Proffesional and not nice or pleasant at the same time.  Food? 5 stars! Service?i give 2 stars also I should give only 1 star for the service we got, based on the restaurant quality, price and expectations.  You need to be better in service - much better  Sorry"}
{"text":"I have been hesitant to go here, since it's freaking fondue, for Pete's sake.  Make it at home.  Also, they're really freaking expensive for fondue, so I couldn't see a reason to go.  But then Restaurant week came, with a $15 lunch at MP.  I went with a couple of friends and their child around 2 pm.  The 3 year old was treated magnificently!  The cheese fondue was amazing, the court bouillon broth for the entree was so tasty, I would have been overjoyed to have a bowl, and the chocolate marshmallow dessert was fabulous.  The only issue was that thought they say unlimited accompaniments; we were only half way through our chocolate when we ran out of the (VERY LIMITED) amount of sides.  We requested more, as well as coffee drinks.  When our waitress returned 2 of the drinks were wrong, and she brought us 6 slices of fruit.  That means: 2 1/3 inch chunks of banana, 2 half strawberries and 2 pineapple chunks.  That's it.  For the whole half pot of chocolate.  One coffee drinker asked for her coffee to be corrected, and it was brought out wrong again.  I realize the server was likely busy, but the service flopped all over the floor at the end of the meal, after being fabulous at the beginning.  It really felt as though she wanted to flip the table, rather than allow us to finish our dessert."}
{"text":"Super nice people and the dessert was great. The waitress recommended the drinks and dessert, both were excellent. I've never tried this place in Chicago but now I will."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot (MP) is one of those places where the cost does not justify the meal. My boyfriend and I dined here on the last day of Restaurant Week, 2015. The menu sounded appetizing and I'd never dinner at the MP before so it sounded like a solid pick.  I made RSVP I believe on a Tuesday. The earliest we could make the RSVP for was 9:30pm. This right there told me they were going to be packed. And packed they were when we got there. Luckily, we ended up not waiting too long to be seated. Mostly that was because a table in the bar area became available which is less popular than the dining room. The hostess asked if we would be OK with our seat or it would be close to a 15 minute wait to be seated in the main dining area. It made no difference to me so the bar was fine. In fact, I really liked our seat.  As I read reviews from other Yelpers! on here, I see a lot of people write about their wait service. Fortunately for us, our waitress was great. Kyla was her name. Thought she did a wonderful job. I believe it was her first night as a waitress and she was fantastic. Thank you, Kyla!  Getting to the actually food. Excuse my ignorance but I was not expecting this to be a place where you cook your own food. LOL! I am actually embarrassed to say that but it's true. The idea however is cool so I had no problem with it. What I did have a problem with was how portion sizes compared to the price of the meal. Again, this was Restaurant week so they had \"specials\" . I ordered  the \"Silver Plate\" which was 3 shrimp, 3 pieces of white chicken breast , 3 piece of beef and 3 VERY SMALL bite site sized spinach and artichoke ravioli. When I say small, I mean like nickel sized. It cames with a variety of sauces which were very good. Problem? Well, you had more sauce than you had actual meat to dip them in!!!!  We ordered a special broth that was $2 compared to two other broths that were free. It also came with a salad and of course, shared desert. I grocery shop a lot so I know how much food cost. The most expensive thing on the plate were the shrimp (medium sized). I just do not see how this meal could cost $25. For the third time, this is Restaurant Week so I am sure the price is more in retrospect. Also, if you're a vegetarian, do bother to come here. The menus is very limited.   At the end of the nite, I was satisfied. Not full but not hungry. I was very much in the middle. I will say thought that later that night, I made me a sandwich at home.  The Melting Pot is more about the experience of eating fondue than it is about the actual food. Do not come here if you're starving or you will be be terrible disappointed."}
{"text":"I think the people knocking the price or the simplicity of the food just don't get it.  Obviously you don't go to a place like this for the food itself, it's for the experience.  Could I make fondue at home?  Maybe, but the logistics of serving 5 different meats with 7 different sauces as the 3rd course of a 4 course meal would be a total nightmare.  Anyway, my girlfriend and I just went here to celebrate Valentine's day.  They had a four course meal as the special.  Started out with a cheese dish, we went with the fiesta cheddar.  Tasted pretty good, although we asked for it medium-hot (the server adds jalepeno to taste), and it didn't seem spicy to me at all.  For salad, we got the caprese, which was mainly giant tomato slices with fresh mozzarella- despite being out of season, the tomatoes tasted great.  The main course was a platter with filet mignon, lobster tail, pork tenderloin, chicken breast, and shrimp (4 pieces of each, although each piece was big enough to be 2 bites).  We went with the coq a vin cooking broth, as it seemed the best for first-timers like us.  The meats came with 7 sauces - butter and lemon for the lobster, cocktail sauce for the shrimp, terayaki, plum sauce, curry sauce, a bleu cheese-like sauce, and a cream cheese-sour cream-chive mixture.  The combination of meats and sauces basically made each bite a different taste - the variety is amazing here.  The only down part was the chicken which seemed a bit dry and flavorless to me.  I was surprised by how good the pork was - I am a steak lover and I think I placed the pork above the filet.  For dessert we went with the cappuccino milk chocolate.  It came with the vast selection of sweets - bananas, strawberries, pineapple, marshmallows, pound cake, brownies, and cheesecake.  Don't think I could pick a favorite - all were delicious.  We didn't use all the chocolate, but it was still a ton of dessert.  To go with our meal we got a bottle of chardonnay recommended by the server - probably the best I've had.  Our server was great - he seemed very knowledgeable and friendly.  All in all, we were there for over 2 hours, and it barely felt like that because we were having such a great time.  Total bill came to $170 with tax/tip, but it was worth every penny for a great night out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  You do need time though since you cook your own food. Get the four course dinner.  Definitely worth it. The dessert was amazing too. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Fun night out definitely make a reservation. If you never had fondue I would definitely give it a try especially if you enjoy cheese. You get a choice of 4 cheese combo and 4 different protein steak fish ribs etc a salad  and a chocolate fondue with assorted treat to dip for dessert. It's a bit pricey 45 an entree but they're always part of restaurant  week each July and January"}
{"text":"We went here for Restaurant Week in Madison since the Melting Pot is pretty pricey. He'd been here before and this was my first time. We were pretty impressed with the service and all the food.   They had us seated in the area called \"Lovers Lane\" which are small booths lined up next to each other in a very intimate setting.  Very cute. Our server was very helpful in the different suggestions for us.  We asked for the wine pairing that came with the Restaurant Week menu (3 wines for $10!), but due to some misunderstanding, she brought out three wines she thought would compliment the foods and not the wines that were on the menu for the Restaurant Week.  But it was a great misunderstanding! I wish those were the wines on the Restaurant Week menu. I'm not a big alcohol person. I enjoy an occasional glass, but since our wedding is coming up and we want wine/beer bar at the wedding, this misunderstanding led us to a great wine!  Anyway, we ended up doing the 4 course option. We chose to do the Wisconsin Trio as the first course.  A great blend of butterkase, fontina, and blue cheese with a sherry and white wine base and herbs.  For the salad, I had the Crab Louis, which was delicious. Great mix of crab, avocado, lettuce, and dressing.  He had the Watermelon Feta Salad - watermelon with feta cheese and red onions and a vinagrette.  Refreshing and tasty!  Never knew that sort of mix would be so great together! A wonderful summer salad! My entree was the American Classic and his was a Vegetable platter - we chose the Mojo as our soup base.  And for the chocolate/dessert, we had the Dark and Dulce Chocolate Fondue.  The entire meal was great! What a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelmed. I hated every aspect of it, from the ambience to the food to the price point.   It's fondue/hot pot, so expect a lot of humidity from the steams coming off of every table top. Ventilation is poor. The decor is worn and outdated, and the booths are too closely stacked.   As far as the fondue itself, there is nothing special. The cheese and chocolates are standard, nothing you can't easily reproduce at home. The entree portion are tiny. Ravioli is the size of my three year old's shopkin toy pieces. They were cute i guess, but when it's $50/entree? Not so cute. The flavor is palatable, but again nothing you can't accomplish at home. Dinner for two may easily end up costing over $100 not including drinks which is fine if it's more of a fine dining establishment and not a chain. I have much better time going to an asian hot pot paying only a small fraction of what melting pot charges. And i make that comparison because, let's be real, the melting pot is nothing fancy. Definitely will not return and do not recommend."}
{"text":"We went here with another couple and they were celebrating their one year anniversary. It was Monday night, ladies night, and they had fantastic dinner and $5 drink specials. We met our friends by the bar and we were rudely \"greeted\" by the bartender who didn't say \"hi, welcome!\" Or anything along those lines. He instead told us that if we wanted martinis, we were going to have to wait because he was out of martini glasses. The hostess came to the bar to nicely let us know our table was ready. The other couple closed out their tab at the bar, later to find out one of the drinks was on the $5 special list and they were overcharged. The hostess let us know the dinner specials and the drink specials. Even though it was ladies night, she said they don't discriminate and the guys could order anything off the ladies night menu as well! Awesome! We waited about 10 minutes for our server and by the time she greeted our table we already were ready to order dinner. She then informed us that guys can't order off the ladies night menu, but since they gave us the menu she would let it slide. What? Seems like they should let the person handing out menus and going over specials know that little fact. We ordered drinks and dinner. Drinks took a while, and they brought out the wrong martini at one point. Our server was MIA for most of the night. The hostess did more bussing and talking to us than our actual server. When our main course came out the guys got their food, but they brought out the wrong food for us ladies...so we waited again. Food was pretty good and the martinis were good as well, but that doesn't make up for horrible service. I felt bad for our friends because they were celebrating a special night and the highlight of the evening was how awful the service was."}
{"text":"This review came really close to receiving only one star, but it was saved by the desert, which I'll get to later.  We had never tried this place before, as we had heard that it was largely a bit pricey for what you receive. We decided to try it out today for restaurant week.   The hostess was super friendly and got us in right away. She was the single most knowledgeable person we dealt with.   The waitress came to the table and asked if we had dined there before. She clearly didn't understand our response of no, as she didn't bother to explain any part of the service to us. It's not even like fondue is rocket science, but it'd have been nice to know what came with our choice, and if the salad came out before or after the cheese. (Pro-tip, it's after).   We were there for lunch and got the \"Spinach and Artichoke\" fondue. She brought out a tray of stuff, and mixed everything in without asking us any questions or explaining anything. Worse, she didn't even add all the cheese that she had brought out. She immediately left without explaining what product she had left in front of us. When we finally got her back over, we asked where the meat was. Turns out there's no meat in the lunch portion, which would have been great to know BEFORE WE FREAKING ORDERED. Very underwhelming. We also asked for more ingredients and were brought exactly 2 pieces of extra bread and 3 tomatoes. Gee, thanks.   Finally our salads came out. I had an over dressed Caesar salad with practically raw, hardened, and greasy bacon. I did not finish it and even said I didn't enjoy it, and she did/said nothing. He got the watermelon salad which is clearly trying to get on the current foodie train. It was edible at the very least and the dressing was enjoyable. But I can't imagine that anyone enjoys half a pound of raw red onions on anything.   Next came desert, which was in a word astounding. Literally the **only** enjoyable aspect of this experience. The Dark/Dulce fondue was heavenly. The salt on top made it just shy of divine. Again though, we asked for additional ingredients as we still had half a pot of chocolate and were brought 3 bananas (why the fuck would you bring an odd number of anything to a couple? I love him, but that does NOT mean that I'm willing to share) and 3 pieces of pound cake.   Even though Restaurant Week brought the price down to $15 per person, which is stupid considering the small portion of cheese you get (or we got), it was still over expensive for what we received.   I can not imagine coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out TMP after hearing much ado about it from friends - and we had a coupon.  Overall, I can't say tha the menu was anything special.  The food was good, but, for the price we paid (even WITH coupon), neither my husband nor I was enamored enough to say we'd go back.    Our waiter was great.  The drinks were smooth.  The booth they put us is nice and quiet, but crowded with everything they put on the table.  In the survey questions, for attire, I'd say dressy.  Not a restaurant I'd go to in jeans and a tshirt - tho there were people who were.  Be un-American and dress up a little.  Nice to try once, but, can't say we'll be back unless its with people who really want to try it."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot never disappoints. It's always a wonderful experience. Our family loves coming here for special occasions. There are so many different selection of cheese and chocolate fondue I don't know if I'll ever get enough!"}
{"text":"I've been to numerous melting pots and this is one of the worst ran franchises. And let me say I think the idea of fondue is great for an evening out.   My biggest gripe with this location is service and bar experience. Of course you prepare your own food so can't get upset about that.   Their wait staff is young and inexperienced. They don't understand how drink menus. And their bartenders don't know how to make drinks."}
{"text":"We were looking for a New Year's Eve Dinner spot and wanted to try the Melting Pot as we really hadn't done the whole thing before.  They had a preset menu which we knew about. Overall, it's obviously pricey especially on New Year's. We knew that going in so it wasn't a big surprise. The food was good, but you are coming here more for the overall experience. Can you do fondue at home? Absolutely.  We had made a reservation in advance but for some reason they didn't have it in the system. However, they were great about getting us seated still right away. I forgot our servers name but she was fantastic, and had only been there for a short time.   This isn't somewhere we are likely to return to anytime soon, but was nice to try out for the evening. Be sure to block off a few hours, as it takes a lot of time to go through all of the courses.   My recommendation that if you were interested in trying The Melting Pot would be to go for just the cheese fondue/chocolate fondue and skip the full entree. A lot cheaper and your not missing much and still getting the experience. I do know that they offer some deals during Happy Hours and sometimes will have Groupons as well."}
{"text":"I don't know what a real fondue should be like, but it's a fun experience for a first-time eater! The staff was very friendly and explained how the entrees work. I tried the cheddar cheese fondue. Lots of fun as you see how the fondue is being made just in front of you. There were three different bread, veggies, and green apples to go with the fondue. The garlic bread made a perfect match with the cheese, and to my surprise, the green apple also went amazing together with cheese.  For the house salad, I liked their tangy dressing very much. And as they recommended, the salad also goes well with their housemade garlic and wine powder. For the pot, you can choose three different entrees. I would say go with their recommendations. I liked the pesto chicken the most. The BBQ pork and white shrimp also taste very good. Not that much into their beef options, lots of room for improvement. At last, the dessert menu, including the chocolate fondue and coffee/martini, they all look so good! But I was already too full to care for any dessert.  It's pricy, but worth it for an experience. Try to find deals on Groupon and buy it with a local promo code."}
{"text":"Very prompt and attentive service. We only had dessert but it was a good experience. Loved the decor as it seems to be a bit newer compared to other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"If you go with an open mind and don't mind paying around $120 for two people, you will enjoy it. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating for our three course meal. Good for special occasions, but not somewhere to go on a regular basis. Perfect for a first date or a blind date!"}
{"text":"When my friends and I arrived, we were told by the hostess that she would have to check if the server was available before we could be seated. We asked if we could just wait in the bar area until it was ready.  She again had to check on that.  When we finally got back to the bar, they only had 8 bar stools and 5 were used leaving only single stools. We stood, where it took 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us, then she had to get herself a coffee before asking what we would like, taking another 5 minutes to make our complicated drinks (g&t and a bottled beer). We were then told that a table was ready and were led back to a mostly empty dining room. We asked the server about the happy hour that was on the sign in the entry and were told it's for the bar area only and she'd have to ask if it would be okay for her move us back to the bar. We left and went to Ginza. Melting Pot needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a special treat! I go here every year for my birthday dinner and have tried a fair majority of the menu items. It is pricey, which is why I don't frequent the place but you sure do get what you pay for! The service is give or take depending on who you get as your waiter, however you should expect to spend a lot of time here. The four course meal can take anywhere from 1-2.5 hours. I would not recommend this place if you're in a hurry!  As far as the food goes, it's some of the best! My go-to favorites are the land and sea meat combo which features shrimp, chicken and steak. The seasonings used are perfect! The spinach artichoke is one of our favorite cheeses although the classic cheddar is good as well. For dessert we've settled on the Flaming Turtle as the favorite. After trying every single chocolate on the menu, nothing beats this classic. A fabulous treat to watch it be made and to eat!  Will continue to be back for my birthday in the coming years!"}
{"text":"It was a fun place. I have to say that if we go back, we only will be doing cheese and chocolate."}
{"text":"I first went to the Melting Pot about three years ago and had a pretty good experience. I wanted to check it out again so I recently went and was disappointed. Their wait staff was such a mess; we were served by at least 3 different people and a few of them could not answer basic questions without having to double check. The presentation was not good; last time I went it seemed much better. The fondue itself was alright, but it is way overpriced. The bread seemed dry and the extra meat we got with it was not impressive for the add on price. The chocolate fondue was also good, but not spectacular. Unfortunately disappointed; I wish there were better places to get fondue here."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The food was great, the staff were happy and friendly and the atmosphere was great. We had the four course meal and loved it! My favourite was the cheese fondue course. We had the cheddar cheese which was divine. For salad i had a caesar salad which was very good. For our entree we had The Classic and the the Pacific Rim plate and we shared them between us. All of the food was excellent!! For dessert we had the chocolate fondue and it just rounded the night off perfectly. As an added bonus on Thursday nights bottles of wine are half price so we also had a lovely bottle of wine to accompany our meal. A wonderful night and will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum.  N'uf said.  Dinner was amazing.  This was our fourth time at this restaurant.  I had the Ahi tuna.  Yum.  For vegetarians there are a few choices, the spinach artichoke ravioli and a vegetable platter.  Others in our party had the salmon and one person had steak.  The wait staff is very friendly.  We all got the four course meal.  My only criticism is they don't have a diaper changing station in the mens room.  I asked the desk and they did not think they even had one in the ladies.  I'd suggest they become more baby friendly.  But the food is amazing."}
{"text":"My friend and I were having a girls day and she chose Melting Pot for lunch. Well, weren't we surprised to find out there is no lunch menu!?!?  WTH? Who goes to lunch on a Saturday and pays anywhere from $16 - $40 for an entree??  We ended up just doing the cheese fondue with a salad. I had water and my bill was still $18. The fondue was good, but we got tiny bowls of raw veggies, a granny smith apple and some bread to dip in. These bowls were to share, we did not each get our own. The salads were fresh, but small and added an additional $5.50 to the meal. My friend had a blackberry sage lemonade and that added another $5+ to her bill. We left still hungry and shocked at the prices. I seriously do not know how they stay in business! In fact the place was empty at lunch except for us and one other table. Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job, but that was the only positive thing about our visit. Way too many better places in Madison to spend that much money for a meal of fondue. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Amazing waitress, great food, and good atmosphere. No matter what you're there for, GET A CHOCOLATE FONDUE. Since you are cooking your own food, the dinner takes longer. We didn't have a wait (we made a reservation) and we were there for around 2 hours. We will be going back"}
{"text":"Had the 3 course meal. I was not impressed at all; very disappointed in fact. I did not like the food choices that they served us in the cheese course. Would have much rather spent my money at the cheese cake factory!"}
{"text":"The food was good, and it was a fun experience to share with friends, but I have to say, it's WAY overpriced.  We spent $120 for two people, and we were not full.  In our opinion, it's not worth the money."}
