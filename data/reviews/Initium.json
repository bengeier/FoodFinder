{"text":"Been going to Tim for some years now for a haircut. Every cut comes with a head massage. Great service for what you pay. Although some of my friends say that i pay way too much for a men's cut :P"}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with some friends over coffee. I ordered a latte, and it was surprisingly good! Since it is a hair salon, lounge, and also has painting classes, I did not expect the coffee to be that great. The price for drinks were average too, around $4-6 each. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing, as we came in the afternoon on a weekend. 

The latte art was adorable too! They take requests for latte art if you have a specific one in mind. Of course, they are not the genuine latte art made from the milk foam but just a stencil with espresso powder. Still, I appreciate the thought and creativity. 

A great place to chat and possibly do work on your laptop if the cafe is not too busy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff is SUPER friendly and the food looks amazing. It is also fun to play around for coffee designs. I will consider coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Great customer service and latte work. Enjoyed the Green Tea latte and the Initium Toast (great breakfast food). The cold black sesame tea latte wasn't that good, probably would have been better if it was hot. It didn't have a strong taste and wasn't smooth. Lounge was nice and comfy, had plugs so it'd be a great place to study in. Drinks on average were $5-7."}
{"text":"Starting coming here for my haircuts and did not make a bad decision. Head massages while you get your hair washed is one of the most relaxed experience you'll have. Their coffee is also amazing. Try the green tea latte while you're here!"}
{"text":"just had a hair cut this Friday,and booked an appointment to color my hair this Saturday.I requested Vivian to color my hair,as she always notices my hair quality and the difference between layers from previous color to treat my hair particularly, the outcomes are always outstanding.And she gave my hair a free treatment after coloring,that was amazing!My hairs is so smooth I can't believe I just did color. I couldn't go somewhere else for my hair. I love to request Vivian to assist as junion to wash my hairs too.Here is the only place I had ever been where they provide such good massage while washing hair. Vivian has the best techniques,yet she is busy all the time.That's too bad.( :3 )Anyways,I like to come here for my hairs?and it's also a nice place to hang out with friends to drink,even has karaoke and cards too.Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Location: Kind of hard to find inside the plaza, you may have to drive around for a bit. 

Facility: Clean, modern and completely separated from the salon. Washrooms are nice. 

Food Quality & Price: I didn't come for a haircut, but wanted to find a cozy coffee lounge where we could meet up with friends for a short get together. Probably a big mistake. The menu selection for savory food is quite limited in my opinion. Out of the 6 of us, no one was very impressed. 

With such glowing reviews from others, I suppose my expectations were a little high going in. Latte art is nice, but I prefer drinks that taste of quality rather than just look good. That said, it tasted okay. I also ordered the ham and cheese croissant and was rather disappointed. It was edible, but seemed like it was reheated in the microwave (not fresh). The guys ordered a pizza each but were still pretty hungry afterward. 

Also, some of the menu options pictured here on Yelp are no longer available (like scones). 

Service: It was okay. Standard, sufficient, not exactly warm or anything. 

Overall: I mean, it's a nice option to have while you're waiting to get your hair done, or waiting for a friend. But as a stand alone cafe, I was thoroughly disappointed. Latte art is nice, but it definitely seems quick gimmicky and caters to a very young crowd. You're probably a teen or in your early twenties if you're loving this place. Likely will not return."}
{"text":"They have just moved from the HSBC building to this new location. Great work as usual. Better water pressure. More parking space. What are they going to offer with the bar?"}
{"text":"The food art is super cute! But the food and drinks are just meh.

Came with a friend today and ordered 2 lattes and the matcha cheesecake. It's like they could read our minds and made the art into things we actually liked! I ordered the black sesame latte. Not as much black sesame flavor as I hoped for. The cheesecake seemed like it was thawed out and served. Boo. It started tasting better when it sat for a while at room temperature. 

Also, they were continuously looping a Jack Johnson track for the whole duration of our stay. Now I can't get the song out of my head! I hope this was just a one time occurrence otherwise I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped on a whim because of the good reviews and it was across from our hotel. It was soooo good! One of the best coffees I have had!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere, you can plug in some earphones to study or just chill around.
Haircuts are a bit pricey and misleading on other websites (they are around $30 range)

Barista was really nice too!"}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Cotton Candy Latte

|| Rating: (9/10) Drinks, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

|| My Experience:  

Nestled off Woodbine, beside EVO nightclub, is this quaint cafe/lounge. Although it shares itself with a hair salon, the cafe operates independently, with its own staff and baristas. 

The cotton candy can be added to every coffee creation. We went with a green tea latte and a normal latte, and asked for some latte art. We found our cups decorated with By-max and Hello Kitty, along with a giant side of cotton candy! They had sold out if cheesecake, so we went with green tea crepe cake, which was decorate beautifully. 

Aside from the coffee creations, they also have a full bar and beer selection. Great place for a late night hang out! 

Some reviews seemed a bit critical of this spot, but I do not emulated those negative sentiments. The cotton candy was fresh and light, with the coffee drinks being quite tasty. 

We also received a \"15% you next visit\" with our receipt, which I look forward to using on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Interesting combination between salon, bar and cafe. I got here in the afternoon on a Sunday and it was relatively quiet. I ordered a green tea latte which wasn't anything special but you can install an app called Coffee Ripples to get a custom image on the foam of your drink! Definitely was neat and something worth trying out. 

Seating was comfortable and spacious with some board games & a foosball table in the back (this was oddly placed as it was right outside the bathroom and since you could see people getting their hair washed through the glass on the other side). 

Overall, good place to hangout and didn't feel rushed at all despite staying for several hours."}
{"text":"This is not my typical hair salon.  But it was pretty chic, And interestingly there is a cafe as part of it.  Not sure if they serve alcohol, but tea was offered with my cut :)

Started off with a shampoo then cut by senior stylist who did a good job.  I didn't want anything fancy but not the $8 cut either.  I got a yelp check in discount of 10% as well but the men's cut was around $40.  Though she did do almost the whole cut and style with scissors as opposed to clippers - I appreciate that.

Finished with another shampoo (which I absolutely need because I hate all the little hairs left over after a cut that get everywhere).  All in all a good service.

This is an Asian joint, I'm not.  So there wasn't much conversation.  But if all you're after is a decent style for a reasonable sum I would recommend it.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Initium Breakfast Toast was filling and amazing, I'd suggest you to get it if your are feeling hungry! I got a hot chocolate with blueberry cotton candy on top and the cotton candy was very fluffy and delicious. 
The servers there were very approachable and they were very nice. It was cool to be in this hipster environment. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Lovely place for an afternoon study session or a quite evening with the boyfriend. It is attached to a salon which makes it super convenient for the SO to sit and enjoy a cuppa while the missus gets her hair cut (or vice versa).
Came by Friday evening and ordered a cotton candy latte and a black sesame latte. I really enjoyed both their drinks and their presentation. The atmosphere was also quite lovely and relaxing and the staff was very nice, friendly and patient with me as I couldn't decide what I wanted.
Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends to catch up over the holidays and exchange presents. We made reservations prior since we are a larger group but if you're a group of 2-3 there are lots of tables available. 
It was very hard to find since it was newer as well I came from the woodbine street and you could only turn in from 1 direction so I had to make a U turn down woodbine. A bit difficult to find but now I know to go to the parking via the back!  Once I got there my friends were seated already and there was another larger party (around 8) that were painting I guess they may have rented it out for hosting a painting class. That was interesting to see. 

The menus were simple and even tho they had a few dessert items on the menu most were not available. Only the crepe cake was available. And only limited flavours they only had 1 green tea slice and 4 black tea. I snatched up the green tea one but it's surprising to hear only 1 slice available. It was quite pricy at 12.95 a slice. Most places which offer the Millie crepe is 7.95. However, since I was splitting the cake with a friend it worked out around same price. The drink I ordered was off the menu which was their cotton candy espresso. It's priced at $7.95, again steep price but I think it's worth it for the presentation. It comes in different colours and is fun to eat. The cup it comes in is steamed milk and the espresso shot is at the side. My friend opted for a green tea latte instead with cotton candy for the same price. 
The server who was I think Ryan accommodated our group very well. There is free wifi and he answered a lot of our questions. As well I had a friend who ordered a green tea latte and after 5 min it came, he came back with a new latte as he said the first one did not come out as expected (referring to the latte art) the barista was trying to make a baymax figure but probably failed as it came out with some blobs. We didn't notice too much tho! The next latte that came had intricate hearts (pics attached). Another friend had ordered a breakfast French toast which she said was yummy, it looked great as well! 
We stayed for quite a bit ... Around 3 hours! There was not too many other tables.  It was separated from the salon so I did not notice if there were many customers at the salon either.  
The service was good but I hoped we would get some
Water refills.  Great place for just catching up and playing some games.  Their menu needs to expand tho and offer items they advertise. 

Will try this place again."}
{"text":"Came here 3 weeks ago hoping to get the cotton candy on a latte, sadly I didn't because their cotton candy machine broke. It's pretty cool how they print cool design on your drinks. I went in the afternoon it was really empty so the food was serve quick. Kinda weird how there's the salon is inside, right next to the cafe. The matcha green cake tasted good. The fries tasted similar to Costco fries and my caramel latte tasted a typical caramel latte."}
{"text":"I come here often. I've tried having my hair cut and even dined during lunch time. I booked an appointment and didn't have to wait long. Ken did a good job with my hair.
 
I really like their green tea latte and their food is appetizing as well, perfect portion size.

It's also a good place to hang out at during the night. You can karaoke and drink."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this local cafe on a Sunday to work on some wedding planning. Initium is a salon/cafe/lounge, pretty cool actually.  It was 1pm when we got there, was pretty quiet. We were able to sit at a big table right away. He ordered the latte, and I ordered the black sesame latte. All the coffee and hot drinks had the option of adding your own person \"latte or milk foam art\" via Coffee Ripples ~ So of course we decided to use each other's faces!! 
The sesame latte was very aromatic, like the sesame seeds were roasted beforehand. Really good!! I also really enjoyed drinking the FHubs' face as well  Would definitely love come back to try some of their coffee with their cakes!!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place on instagram and was instantly intrigued by their cotton candy lattes. Came here with my boyfriend on friday night. When we got there we realized it was a hair salon/café/bar lounge - at first we thought it was a really weird concept but it actually worked and is definitely really unique. They also had karaoke and some board games there which is definitely a plus. 

The servers are super nice. The cotton candy latte is from their \"secret menu\" but i believe you can add cotton candy to any of their coffee drinks with an additional cost. They do latte art as well - just ask! I got a Baymax on my green tea latte and it was too cute. The green tea latte was really good and creamy. We also got the roasted marshmallow latte with cotton candy - it comes with an espresso shot to pour over the cotton candy so that it melts into your into your drink.

 If you share a post on any social media platform you can get the cotton candy upgrade for free :) Definitely gonna come back to try their other drinks!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try out this unique cafe/salon that I've seen through my constant Yelp visits. I ordered a chai latte with their signature cotton candy on top. The cotton candy btw, is really just a novelty. I would get it once for a picture, and that would be it. I did appreciate though that in spite of me melting the cotton candy into my chai latte, my drink did not become overly sweet. I presume they accounted for the cotton candy's sweetness when making my drink, which I found to be thoughtful. The chai latte itself was also quite good!

I also indulged on a black tea mille crepe. I've seen the classic flavours and matcha flavours in several places but never black tea so I had to try it out. It was also my first mille crepe experience, and I loved it! The mille crepe was not overly sweet, and you can definitely taste the black tea, which I appreciated. The whipped cream that came with it also real and not like cool whip.It is on the pricier end (i think close to $10?), but I would definitely get it if you're in the \"treat yo self\" kind of mood. Would definitely revisit. Maybe I'll go back to try their brunch menu, which I was quite surprised to see."}
{"text":"+ 0.5 stars for good service

Initium is an interesting place - upon entering, you'll find their hair salon on the right side and their cafe/restaurant/bar on the left side. I came on a weekend afternoon and ordered their green tea latte as well as a green tea crepe cake. They specialize in latte art here, but note that they charge an additional ~$2 for customization. Basically you download an app and upload a picture that you would like printed on your latte. I decided not to pay the extra fee, and ended up with a cute Pusheen cat on my latte (thanks to the barista!). Would recommend getting a hot drink for the cuteness and instagram-worthiness. Both the latte and crepe cake tasted good.

They have outlets and a solid wifi connection. However, the only things that would deter me from staying long here are the strong chemical smells coming from the hair salon (it'd be nice if there was more separation) and the loud music blasting the entire time (may be dependent on the workers' moods that day)."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

The perfect spot to chill over a cup of latte or a glass of wine. They also have desserts and savoury items although I haven't tried them myself.

There are also board games, a foosball table and open mic karaoke on weekends for those who enjoy singing without having to pay for a room. You can do it all at no additional costs! 

Service is also very attentive and friendly. Definitely a great uptown option!"}
{"text":"So shocked when the bill came out, $17 CAD with tip (I'm American) for two custom print lattes, and a pistachio cheesecake. That for me is super reasonable. 

I was amazed at how smooth their green tea latte was, some places make it kind of chalky. 
The cheesecake was also beautiful and not too sweet. I love the rosemary and honey they decorated with. 

My friend and I were both pretty excited about our drinks. The laser print turned out very well and it is definitely a fun quirk that you don't find often. 

We were both working on something and it was obvious they were good at picking up social cues because they didn't bother us at all but as soon as we needed someone almost immediately a waitress helped us.

Came in around 1 pm and it was just us and a couple more people but super quiet and peaceful."}
{"text":"Always into a new cafe that I can go to with friends to hangout or get some work done. This location definitely has that atmosphere to it.

The store itself is a little hard to find in my opinion. It is in the newer plaza at Woodbine and Highway 407, but only has one entrance depending on which direction you're coming from. The cafe itself is on the smaller side, connected to a salon. I personally find the pricing a little too much myself, so will most likely not come back for a cut. 

As for the cafe, it had some comfortable seats and a good variety on the menu. From coffees and teas, to some snacks and even a bar. You get yourself a caffeine fix or a drink depending what you're feeling. The Hazelnut Macchiato was quite good, and I hear that the Cotton Candy Latte is a specialty (it is now on the menu as well). For food, I tried the Japanese Naan Pizza, which had a really great flavour and chunks of eel! Definitely a great choice in my opinion. 

Staff were very friendly and very attentive. Seemed to really enjoy what they do. Just make sure you speak with someone from the cafe side rather than the salon side.

Prices seem about average for a smaller cafe, so worth giving it a shot if you're into that sorta thing! The 10% off with the check in is always a plus as well!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Initium to try out their cotton candy latte... only to be told that they don't offer that anymore! Guess it will be something I will need to DIY at future parties... I was really looking forward to it!

Green Tea Latte - I know reviews below said it was amazing... but for me I would want it in a larger size and with more green tea flavour. I did appreciate that not-overly-sweetness of the drink. Also loved the latte art shapes we got. Origami heart  and unicorn  

Green Tea Mille Crepe Cake - lacked flavour, but I did like the blueberries, chocolate and graham crackers (even better if it was the smashed up kind - the ones served were of the thin dust-like kind.

Signature Initium Toast - tasty and flavourful (just a bit harder than expected), but great flavour with stuffed ham, and topped with cheese, bacon bits, onion, and seaweed! Yum!

We used the yelp discount 10% which helped but it still came to $31 for 2 people, and for a snack break, it seemed a bit overpriced. For the same price elsewhere, I got a sandwich, side soup and small (individual portioned) cake.

Ambience - it was nice that I didn't really smell the salon (until I got to the washroom area). Seating is a bit limited but it was a cozy comfortable cool vibe.

Service - it was good! No issues. They were chill about us taking a bunch of photos and we didn't feel rushed. It wasn't busy at the time we dined, but overall staff seems pretty chill and relaxed.

Overall, a good place to try out if you haven't been there yet. And a good place to go back when I am craving that toast again! :)"}
{"text":"Things are cute, food is alright. Super expensive for no reason. Maybe because they make their food \"cute\"

We came here just for the cafe and I felt like I was just sitting in a salon drinking my latte. Maybe if you are here only for the haircut you would have a better experience, but seriously - if you come here just for the food and cafe. Don't even bother. It's expensive and you smell like salon after."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday for afternoon tea with a friend. We were seated in the cafe area where there were a few tables lined along a wall with sofa seats. My friend sat on a chair while I sat on the sofa. The tables were a bit too low in proportion to the height of the chairs so it was a bit uncomfortable. 

I ordered the Green Tea Latte that came with a minion design on it along with the Initium Signature Toast. The latte had a strong matcha flavour with a very smooth layer of froth on top. The latte design was a little faint but the overall taste was great. The toast is a bit heavy and filling so make sure you are hungry before ordering it. It was fully stuffed with smoked ham, a sunny side egg, bacon bits, onion and lots of cheese. It was definitely more like a brunch item than a snack. I'll definitely be back to try a few other drinks from their coffee menu. 

A little tip on getting to the cafe safely: 
If you're coming from the north on Woodbine Avenue, turn into Yorktech Drive and then into Bodrington Court to get to the plaza where the cafe is located. Otherwise, you'd be making a very dangerous and illegal left turn on Woodbine into the plaza."}
{"text":"Came for a quick coffee break with the fiance just a little after 5pm. It was our first time here even though we pass by all the time. The service was great and our lattes were on point. We got a green tea latte and black sesame latte. Both were great but we both felt the green tea latte was better. It was pretty flavorful and I was quite content that the milk did not overpower the green tea. It was definitely made better than Starbucks. I was a bit disappointed the cotton candy machine was down, so I couldn't try their cotton candy latte. I guess I'll be back soon for it, maybe with my laptop too. It felt like a great spot to get some work done."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Love the grape flavor cotton candy on coffee."}
{"text":"Intium seems like the offspring of someone who had too many ideas. \"I want to open a hair salon! Oh...but people like coffee right? Let's add a cafe! What if people want to sing? Throw in some karaoke!\" 

I had heard a lot about the hair salon/cafe combination, but the karaoke came as a surprise to me. Some friends and I came to the cafe side on a Saturday night (hair salon's closed). It's a cozy space with enough room for 3-4 large groups. The drinks themselves are on the pricey end and I think you're paying for the art on top more than the drink itself. A bunch of us ordered green tea lattes and while delicious, they weren't anything extraordinary. Latte art was on point though.

The karaoke wasn't like an actual karaoke place. It's more like they have a giant wall projection and screens with karaoke capabilities. If anyone wants to sing, take a mic and go for it! The servers are very open to it (the other customers' tolerance would depend on your singing ability, I guess). 

There was another review saying they didn't like that the servers were doing karaoke among themselves. I guess they thought it detracted from the cafe experience. On the contrary, I found this really fun! It's like you're in a giant room with friends and everyone just wants to get their song on. I didn't think it really hurt the service, and it definitely boosted the atmosphere. It really showed that these people enjoyed working there and that translated to some great attitudes. 

I think the other two groups that were in the cafe at the time actually knew the owners and we were the only random customers. We weren't given inferior treatment because of this though. 

The servers were all very friendly. At one point, we were encouraged to \"not be shy\" and my guy friend took this very much to heart, belting out an enthusiastic manly rendition of \"Let It Go\". Surprisingly, everyone was still nice to us after the singing! I think that in itself, warrants repeat visits.

{"text":"(Drinks:)
The GREEN TEA LATTE was nice and light!  Very flavourful and even had a cute little design on top with no extra charge!

(Price:)
GREEN TEA LATTE: $5.45 ( a bit pricey)

(Ambience:) 
Super cute!  Its a cool concept to combine a cafe and hair salon together!

(Service:)
Great!  Wifi is a bit slow though.

(Overall:)
There are a lot of things on the menu to try that are unconventional.  There are printed coffees (where you can add your face to the coffee!  There is also this cotton candy coffee to try (too bad the machine was broken, so I couldn't try it)."}
{"text":"I came to get my hair cut as I hadn't in a long time.  I was able to book a last minute appointment with Wilson a director level stylist and off I went.  Impeccable customer service as they do a coat check for you as soon as you get there.  They offer you a drink and magazines.  

As I said in my previous review the reason I choose to come to Initium is because of the head massage you get when you get your hair washed.  The woman who washed my hair was Vivian I believe and she did such a thorough and fantastic job I was in heaven.  She washed my hair twice and then she did the massage and it was heavenly as she not only focused on my hair but on my neck and shoulders.  Honestly it was better than going to massage therapy. All the knots I had come in with instantly disappeared. 

After my hair wash Wilson took over and cut my hair exactly as I asked.  He was very meticulous and took his time there is definitely no rushing as he made sure the length was all the same and took his time styling my hair.  I came for the experience and I got a fantastic one at that.  With two young kids it's rare to get time for myself and so this was a perfect salon experience.  Thank you initium for the fabulous experience and the beautiful cut!!!!

P.s. They have a cafe attached to the salon so you can enjoy a drink or snack and it seemed very nice."}
{"text":"is really unique and fun to try out but the cafe section is just right behind the salon area, too strong of the shampoo smell while enjoying the coffee and cake

the hazelnut latte with the blue color raspberry cotten candy and the Japanese green tea crepe cake  are not bad ,worth a try"}
{"text":"This place is wicked!!   Cappuccino tastes waaaaay better with my face on it.   In all honesty though this place is really unique.  Definitely a place to check out.  High quality drinks, many flavors and any design you want.  Will be back. Soon"}
{"text":"None of the desserts on the menu were available, and this was not a busy day at all. Servers didn't notify us that nothing was available until after we had sat down and decided. Server also had no idea what was available or not available when she came to take our order. Not sure how they didn't know.
Would not recommend wasting your time here."}
{"text":"Great place to relax, coffees are great,  foods are delicious,  and staffa are super friendly.   I highly recommend initium to everyone"}
{"text":"What do you get when you mix a salon, a cafe, and lounge? You get Initium. Ryan (one of the owners?) explained that for those visiting the salon who need to pass the time while colouring or perming hair, they need a place to hang out. These days social media has lots of people coming to Initium for the latte art and cotton candy lattes.

We came on a weekday afternoon and ordered 4 different lattes/mochas: green tea latte with soy milk, toasted marshmallow latte with lactose free milk, panda mocha (containing white and dark chocolate) with almond milk, and black sesame latte. We had hoped to try out their millecrepe cakes but they were all out of cakes. We ordered a Canadian naan pizza to share.

Initium just started using a fancy new latte art printer so for a limited time latte art is free. You can even get your company logo or picture printed on your latte using the coffee ripples app. Eventually I'm told they will charge a small fee for latte art. 

I like that the lattes and mochas were not too sweet. They have great microfoam which made the latte drinking experience better and allowed the latte art image to be preserved longer. Hubby ordered the black sesame latte but isn't a huge coffee drinker. We learned it is possible to order a black sesame steamer (not on menu). It is also possible to customize sugar level. 

Initium is a cool place to hang out or perhaps get a bit of work done. They have free wifi. They also have a number of tv screens (at the time of our visit dialed on to CP24). Extra 0.5 star for great service and friendly staff :)

{"text":"I love this place!!!! Their latte art are super cute and people are super nice :). The green tea crepe cake is not on the menu and is around $10 a piece but it's worth trying.. Would come back and visit again!"}
{"text":"This has become my new favourite place to work and I'm ALWAYS here during the daytime (if you're ever looking for me). This is the cutest place in markham for a cute latte! Their lattes are actually strong - this is coming from a starbucks barista (me) who's seen her fair share of good espresso, a nicely made cappucino and just about everything else they offer. Why would I come here for their green tea latte when I get a discount at starbucks? BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING. The matcha is just right, and has a bitter taste just as authentic matcha powder should. Another super cool thing is that they now have a coffee printer and if you download the app 'coffee ripples', they'll print whatever you want on your coffee - even your selfie, you narcissistic bastard. Lol jk, but the coffee printer is the best thing ever. They can also hand-draw your latte art .. if Alexias is in (cool af tatted up mixed girl), ask for her to do some cool stuff on your latte and she will blow your mind.

Their cotton candy is amazing - they hand spin each single one and it's definitely NOT store bought .. have you tasted store bought cotton candy? It does not have the same texture as initium's cotton candy does. Not being a fan of sweets, I still LOVE their cotton candy. Ps. where can you get such unique flavours of store bought cotton candy?? I like the maple flavour because it legit tastes like maple syrup. Sugar rush, omg.
Pps. they have a secret flavour of cotton candy.. if you're nice, they might give it to you ;)

Staff are amazingly friendly, all the time and I la la looooove them all. Owners are great people. On the weekends, they often stay after hours for karaoke + more fun.

Also!! Cool slashie much?! Half hair salon, half cafe? Lattes while waiting for your hair to dry? Yassss. I have an appointment with KK in two weeks because I'm tired of doing my own hair - if you know me, you know I NEVER let anyone else touch my hair. Their stylists are all so cool and have their own style, which I love.

Oh, oh oh! AND ALCOHOL IS CHEAP AF HERE. I'm not kidding. Stella is under $7. WOW."}
{"text":"Came here just for the cotton candy lattes because who doesn't want fluffy cotton candy goodness on top of their caffeinated beverage? We came at around noon and were the first ones at the café, so were greeted and seated promptly. Although it's connected a salon, it's separated by a large wall so you don't feel like you're in a salon at all - which I found really strange when I initially looked it up. 

We were promptly seated and the waitress answered any questions we had. Mainly, which drinks come with the cotton candy? Answer: all of them! They have 3 flavours: vanilla (pink), blue raspberry (blue), and a third one that I can't remember the name of. 

I got the macchiato and my friend got the green tea latte. Both drinks came out quickly but not at the same time. It took all my strength not to start eating mine while waiting for my friend's! The drinks came with two small espresso shots so you can decide how much flavor you want. I thought that was a nice touch. 

In addition to the fun drinks they also have a brunch menu where you can get smoked salmon and croissants! We didn't order off it though. 

Overall I had a very pleasant experience. The waitress was so nice and checked up on us regularly. The drink itself was really expensive - $8. I wouldn't come back here regularly but will be back when I feel like treating myself. 

Parking is found easily right outside."}
{"text":"Once I was here for brunch with my friend. No one came to us for a quite long time until I walked to the bar. The food is way too simple to charge that price.
And it confused me weather it's a painting lounge or a cafe sometimes. It feels awkward when you have a coffee and other people was painting besides you. 
Don't even come in the night, because when you enjoy your wine, the staff will sing Karaoke themselves just besides you."}
{"text":"Latte art to the finest!  I came here for their latte on a weekday and it did not disappoint. This place makes such cute latte arts!! Anything from a batman symbol, the alien from toy story, Baymax or the Minion himself!!  Every latte here is instagram worthy, but taste wise, it is just average, but since it was reasonably priced, I though it was worth it just for the arts itself!

The earl grey crepe cake we had was pretty decent and my friend I enjoyed it.  Only thing I had to complain about is, when I asked for my latte art to be cute, I got some flowers art instead!!! -_- The server told me the artsy person works on weekends, so if you want even cuter latte arts, come during the weekends!!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant service. Nice food for brunch. Just that the latte wasn't hot. Just warm. Would go back to try the cotton candy latte. Very unique to have a hair salon just beside it."}
{"text":"Love the Cafe/salon concept. The review will just be based on the salon portion but so far so good. So I got my hair coloured back in the summer at the salon as I needed to get my blond balayage ends covered for photo purposes. I went with Trevor as one of my girlfriends recommended him. Trevor was very knowledgeable and professional. He suggested colours that would suit my photos and advised the length of the cut since I needed to do up dos. He also suggested when I should come back for colouring since I would need it for a special occasion which was very reasonable. The salon also did not push for me to buy ridiculous hair products and the ones that they recommended were very reasonable. 
I really liked my colour and I felt that after it, my hair was not as dry as my last hair treatment. 

Side note: the hair wash part was so comfortable since the hair massage that came with it was amazing. I almost fell asleep lol.  

Although I won't be needing the colour anytime soon now,  I will definitely be back for a cut or colour! Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Small menu. Hit this place for a quick latte or salad on the go. Nice bar for an evening cocktail before hitting the sheets at the hotel."}
{"text":"After trying their cafe, a bunch of my co workers also raved about their hair services, so I decided to try check it out. I called in a few hours before the appointment and they were able to schedule me in with the director for a cut. Senior cuts are $40 and the Director cuts are $50.  Lip Lam was the one that worked on my hair, after explaining to him how I wanted to keep my length and get some soft layers, he worked his magic, and I left the salon pretty satisfied. At the moment they are running a $100 hair treatment special, which they kept trying to sell to me the entire time. With their 10% off yelp check in , making their rates pretty reasonable, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came to the cafe part of Initium with my friends because we saw a lot of cute IG posts of their coffee art. The interior is dim-lit and cozy. The cafe part of Initium is on the left side of the salon.

HOT WHITE CHOCOLATE w Baymax coffee art (3/5)
The baymax coffee art is so cute! +1 
The drink was okay - it wasn't hot enough for my liking. 
The sweetness level was good though."}
{"text":"Came here on my bday to try their signature cotton candy latte. Unfortunately their cotton candy machine was broken. :( It's ok, we still tried their breakfast and stencil art lattes. 

My order:
Buttery Crossiant with Smoked Salmon 
The crossiant itself was a bit too crispy. But overall taste was ok.
Bymax Chai Latte
Cute Stencil of Bymax, but the latte was a bit bland for my taste.

Initium Breakfast Toast
Nice thick piece of toast with a sunnyside egg baked into it with bacon bits, ham & cheese. Taste was quite nice with a slight sweetness of honey.
Doraemon Green Tea Latte
Cute Doraemon Stencil, but latte was only lukewarm. Taste wise was ok.

Manager was sorry that the cotton machine was broken and he also spilled water on the server counter. So he gave us 15% off. Very nice of him, but spilled water was understandable lol, he really didn't need to tell his staff to apologize. :)"}
{"text":"This place is alright. The cafe spot is small and there are only about 4 tables. The tables are low and but there are 3-4 higher tables. I like how this place customizes the design on top of lattes. The place is a little confusing to find as its on the back of the plaza. It's a good place for gathering with friends! Haven't tried the food items but latte was alright."}
{"text":"Location was a bit difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area.

I find that this is a unique concept where you can wait for your friends to have their hair done while you enjoy some coffee and snacks. I'm not sure if there is a HUGE sanitary issue (I kept on thinking that hair would fly everywhere and it would smell like hair dye), but the cafe location was really clean.

The service was great - they were a bit understaffed with only one barista but she was amazing! She recommended the matcha latte and was able to make it with soy milk! It was pretty good. On the other hand, I tried their ham and cheese croissant and everything tasted like they got it from Costco. I can guarantee the potato salad which was on the dish was from Costco. Overall, the food was really basic, wasn't terrible but you can honestly make it at home for less than $5.

I'll be going back for the cute drinks and latte art :)!"}
{"text":"I love that Initium serves alcohol and not so sweet beverages, yet not a pub or non-alcoholic Starbucks or inside a hotel.  It is good that, in a group gathering, one person can order a coffee, while another can have a wine.  What I love most about Initium is the ambience.  It is more like a lounge than young and hip, cause I am an older adult who feels out of place to line up to order after a group of teenagers.  No offence intended, cause I am the one who is way older than the average age of the target customers of those places.

I think the food here is best of class, too.  We ordered crepe cakes, a sesame latte, a cappuccino, a regular coffee.  All the coffees came with nice coffee art.  The sesame latte tasted interesting, and I liked the richness.  My friends all praised their drinks.  Note: the java is strong.  I had the coffee at around 10 pm, and I stayed awake to 4am next morning.  The crepe cakes were soft, moist, rich, sweet.  We also had a cotton candy.  It is an interesting novelty to appear on a menu.  The child who ordered it found it fun.

Services were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The owners of this place are trying to cram everything they can into one place. There's a hair salon, lounge and a cafe. Did I mention they also have board games? They serve coffee and they serve alcohol.  

I came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was relatively quiet, with only a couple other customers. As most of you should already know, they can print anything you want on their drinks provided you download their app. I found this to be really cool. They do this free of charge which is great. I ordered their Cappuccino ($5) which I liked. I wouldn't say it was spectacular but the fact that they were able to print stuff on it certainty made it better. Presentation of the cappuccino was nice. The pricing is comparable to other cafes. 

The service was quick and the waitress directed our attention to the wifi password right as we seated. 

The interior is nice. They have comfortable seating, various TVs displaying sports, and games. They don't have a big a variety as a board game cafe but they have a decent selection. From what I remember, they had Catan, Monopoly, Connect Four, Battleship, Scrabble, Pictionary, Sudoku. There was also a foosball table in the back. 

Overall, I would return. This is a great place to have a drink, hang out with friends and play a couple of board games. Drinks you order here are definitely Instagram worthy (if you're into that kind of stuff)."}
{"text":"Came in here to take a look since we were intrigued by the concept... also considered getting our hair cut but we definitely came too late in the evening for that. The place is nicely decorated with a sleek, modern feel and there's a fair amount of seating. It was empty when we got there but the service was still excellent. We were greeted and when we asked about the whole concept of the cafe/salon/lounge combination the barista(?) was really friendly and detailed in explaining how things work.

We ordered a green tea latte and a sea salt chocolate chip cookie to go. The green tea latte was quite good - not overly milky/creamy and sugary (which I find Starbucks' green tea lattes to be). A little expensive for a latte ($5.75), though we did get 10% off because we checked in on Yelp :) The cookie was about 2 dollars and a decent size. It was full of chocolate chunks and the salt worked well.

We had a peanut allergy, so we asked about it to make sure. Most servers at restaurants simply give an answer like no, or we can't guarantee that this hasn't come into contact with nuts. Which is the standard answer to cover any problems that might happen and is understandable. This girl explained that the cookies weren't made in the cafe, and later came back to us with the package of cookies with the ingredients list. It was a pleasant surprise and I really appreciated it - and just for that extra effort and consideration I'm giving this place 5 stars. I think they deserve it.

Probably would be a great place to hang with friends - decent prices, decent food, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"This joint is the place to go for a nice cup of chilled iced coffee and at the same receive a professional hair cut. (Massage and hair wash included too)!"}
{"text":"Cool idea with the salon/cafe in one single store front. You don't have to get your hair done just to have a drink here. The salon is separated enough so you really don't have to watch people get their hair cut. On the cafe side there are TV's for watching sports but its not really a large area and probably only seats about 20-30 people max. The menu is small with some drinks, snacks/desserts and even full meals.

Because of my sweet tooth I was really excited to come here after seeing all those cotton candy espresso pictures being posted. When I looked at the menu there was no mention of cotton candy. After asking the waitress I was told its not on the menu but can be ordered. (So how did people find out about the cotton candy espresso in the first place?). Anyway, we were told that you can add cotton candy to pretty much any caffeinated drink on the menu. 

Caramel Macchiato (hot) $5.25 + $2.70 for cotton candy wrapped around your cup for a grand total of $7.95 before tax. (Yikes!) The presentation was really nice with the cotton candy wrapped around your cup and the shot glass on the side with the espresso. The drink was done right and tasted great.

Toasted marshmallow mocha (hot) $5.25 +$2.70 for cotton candy. $7.95 before tax (Double Yikes!!) Tasted slightly sweater than the above drink with the marshmallows and tasted just as good. 

We also got a croissant for $3. Nice and flaky. 
We would have ordered more but they told us before we ordered that all desserts were out of stock except the matcha crepe. I was going to order it but after seeing it was $12.95 I had to decline. Wow this review made me sound so cheap but I'm really not....lol

Its a nice place overall but I find the prices a bit high. Don't forget to get the 10% off Yelp check-in offer. You also get 15% off on your next visit if you shown them your receipt."}
{"text":"Been getting haircut at Initium for years and their new location is pretty cool! Cuz they are now also a cafe and lounge! Haircut for me is always great and now I can enjoy their coffee as I wait for my gf to get her haircut. My girl loves their green tea latte. Toasted marshmallow latte also pretty good but I like to stick with my espresso."}
{"text":"Nestled in next to the Costco at woodbine & hwy7, initium is the all around hang out joint. 

Initium serves an excellent selection of coffee beverages and is only overshadowed by the warm and welcoming staff behind the counter. 

From day to night it is an outstanding place to study, place board games, or knock back a couple brews."}
{"text":"I ordered a caramel macchiato and  New York cheese cake. I like it but share with a salon is a nice style. Next time I will try latte and cotton candy with my friends"}
{"text":"The green tea latte is very good and they put cut faces on it. The staff is very friendly and the environment is very relaxing. A great place to relax and enjoy some sports too."}
{"text":"Quite unique. The service was really nice, the staff were really friendly. I had a grape cotton candy latte, which was alright. I think its more of the \"new, cool\" food factor, rather than the quality of the drinks that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went late night one time, quite hard to fine since its tucked away in the corner. Service was great, but the food was just not notable, not bad, just not memorable."}
{"text":"Love Gigi! She gives me the best haircuts.  And the head massage is amazing!! My go to place for haircuts and color!"}
{"text":"Nice concept- cafe and hair saloon together. A very of coffee drinks and some alcohol selection including wines. Coffee were okay, the sitting space is cozy and cute. The hair saloon is fancy and their consultant is knowledgeable person. She surely has some good tips and ideas for you hair."}
{"text":"I come here on a monthly basis to wait for my bf get his haircut. The decor is beautiful and their couches are so comfy! Also super fast free wifi. 

So far everything I tried was really on point. Their peach Italian soda was bubbly refreshing and just flavourful enough without it being syrupy. The cappuccino was really smooth definitely made from some premium coffee beans and iced green tea latte is always delicious. Tried their cream puffs, Oreo is my favourite but green tea is good too. 


Service is wonderful and the staff are friendly. I recommend this café for chilling with friends, dates and nights out! Will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Ok so I didn't come here for the haircut, I came here just for the cotton candy latte and their latte art. 

It's interesting at how they designed the space as connected next door is a hair salon so customers can wait for their appointments while drinking some latte. However, I hate to say this but I didn't like either of the lattes I ordered. Sure the drinks looked nice, but that's pretty much it. 

-BayMax Latte: 
It's just a regular latte with Bay Max latte art-ish. The latte itself is OK, I have had better in downtown coffee shops. You can ask the barista to customize other latte art design if you like. 

-Cotton Candy Latte (pina colada flavored cotton candy)
Not sure if I got a wrong order or maybe the menu had it wrong, this was not a latte lol. It's essentially cotton candy put on top of a cup filled with just espresso.. The cotton candy itself is store-bought. No, don't tell me that it's fresh, just don't. The cotton candy was extremely sticky and very sweet. I even saw the staff took the candy out of a plastic box that is similar to the one I saw in Metro. 

It didn't taste like pina colada either. They gave us another one which was the maple syrup flavored cotton candy, and it was good but too sweet."}
{"text":"A cute cafe (with a salon at the back/side). Had their pizza and latte, absolutely no complains with their food quality. Food did take awhile to come..waited for approx 25 minutes even when the place is empty. Will come back again for the cute latte art :)
P.s. you can request for personalizes latte art!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first when I heard that this cafe was attached to a hair salon. I mean, the cafe or the atmosphere can't be good if it is second to the hair salon, right? However, after looking at some of the pictures on instagram, I wanted to check it out for myself.

Location/service
I went there at around 6:30pm on a Thursday evening. It was quite hard for me to find the place since it was hidden in the plaza, across from a hotel. As I entered the cafe, the salon was on the right side, with only 2 customers there. I was immediately greeted by 2 waitresses/baristas. The entire cafe was empty, but I guess it is because it was dinner time and the cafe really only served snacks. The interior of the cafe was nice, quite calm, and there were outlets/plugs available for every table if you need it. However, the tables were really low so it might not be comfortable if you decide to do work there for a long time. There is a huge TV with a projector and several tvs for people to watch while hanging out there. It makes sense since they also do private functions there. 

Drinks/Food:
I only ordered a hot sesame latte as I wasn't hungry for food. I also got it customed with the coffee ripples. Since I didn't have the app, I just told the barista to put a cute design on it :) The drink was great. It wasn't those powdered drinks where you can just buy it from the asian grocery store. I was also happy that they have lactose free options! extra points for this :) It was perfect for a chilly evening. However, the price for the drink was quite steep. It was ~$5.40 for the drink + ~$1.75 for the customized ripples. I used the 10% off yelp check-in discount but I still didn't think it was worth it at all. 
Not long later, she came back with a glass of water as she saw me pulling out my laptop. I thought that was very attentive of her. From the previous reviews, some people mentioned that they could smell the hair chemicals from the other side, but luckily I didn't smell anything and I was sitting quite close to the salon. However, I was there during closing time so that might have a big impact. 

Overall, I enjoyed my time there. I will definitely go back to try their other drinks and their signature toast."}
{"text":"Soon enough, if the red tape get their act together, they will also have a little cafe on the side which can also serve red wine.
The owner has impressive plan in growing the place into a hair studio, spa, and lounge. I'm very impressed with the vision behind the place.
Now, here is where it matters: hair \"care\". The welcome person made us feel like we are VIP immediately, and even made sure I'm comfortable (I'm just there to accompany my wife, not giving them business). According to my wife, the person who washed her hair, also gave her a good scalp massage. She was impressed.
Now, my wife's hairstylist was the \"director\", and, though he looks young, show great skill in the way he cuts and trims.
My wife definitely has been impressed with their service, so, if you are looking for a stylist, give then a try."}
{"text":"Went in for a haircut and was suprised that the business started as a latte print shop. The latte had a pikachu on it, which was nice. The haircut was fantastic too, but albeit a bit expensive for a male haircut. Ended up being 50 dollars when i expected it to be around 30. 

Though i was pleasantly surprised that there was also a board game cafe and karaoke lounge inside the establishment."}
{"text":"I came here strictly to see how they do the latte art. They have a machine that can draw a picture of whatever you want. Just download the app, choose a pic and they make it happen. Pretty cool concept! 

Coffees range around 4-6$ and desserts are roughly the same. Pretty expensive but for the experience it's pretty cool to come here once.

They also have a couple of games that you can play with but not that much. 

I tried the oatmeal raisin cookies and it was big and delicious ! $2. They warm is up so it's nice and warm. The blueberry crumble was mediocre, they also warmed it too. 

Overall I'm glad I gave this place a try. I really do like the latte art. Staff is warm and receptive.

Oh, and they play some good beats ;)"}
{"text":"Came to this place late Monday night for the first time because of all the pretty posts I see on Instagram from my friends!

It was a comfortable setting, relaxing, and service was prompt.

I ordered the cotton candy (server even asked what colour I wanted), hot chocolate, and a hot white chocolate (that they made with a minions topping, so cute!)

Price is great for the effort they put into these drinks!

I wish I had remembered to use my 10% off for the yelp check in special, but totally forgot.  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Cant say much about this place for now. Literally drove around the parking lot looking for this place. Guys, its in front of the hotel with a huge sign in the front. 

I came here for their latte art and desserts which the lattes are sooo cute! Since we came late in the afternoon, they were out of desserts and cotton candy. :( place is not busy at around 8pm as workers are singing karaoke if not servicing. Their green tea latte tastes nothing extraordinary. Will have to come back for their other drinks and food though. Remember to check into yelp for a 10% off and keep the receipt for 15% off next visit!!

I really like their concept. Not sure If I would get a cut here but I will be back for their lounge."}
{"text":"Came here late at night with friends and was not disappointed! 

First of all, service was wonderful! We were cheerfully greeted the moment we stepped in and our beautiful server was very friendly and chatted with us! 

The food definitely surpassed my expectations. I planned to just have a latte, but the toast was just too good! It was toasted to perfection with a half boiled egg in the center that melts when you cut. The cakes were very nice as well, although I didn't get to try the crepe cake :(

My friends and I played an intense game of Monopoly until they were almost closing, and we didn't get kicked out either. I'm assuming that our server was the owner as she told us about the board games that she personally brought from home. She was super nice and words cannot describe her outstanding service!

When the bill came, we were quite surprised that it wasn't as pricey as it seemed. 
Reasonable prices and excellent food, definitely a must try and I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for haircuts as the service is really good. Although I haven't been for awhile now (will soon make an appointment), I know that the hairwash is to die for just for the relaxing head and neck massage. They really take their time with you and the hot towel on the neck is a bonus! My go to hairstylist is Gigi and she definitely knows how to cut my hair to my style while keeping it suited to my face. 

Next time, I will try out their cafe as people have said that's really good too. I will update this when it happens."}
{"text":"Event: Saturday night hangout. (Group of 4)

Environment: very nice and relaxing. We played Jenga for 2 hrs. 

Service: wonderful. The waitress was friendly and talkative. Wait time for our drinks wasn't too long but unfortunately she forgot my drink :(.. 

Drink: we all ordered the cotton candy espresso that was not on the menu. It was interesting but taste wise there was nothing amazing about it. Just your regular espresso. The cotton candy didn't really have much taste to it.

Price: expensive :') around $8 for one cotton candy espresso. 

Overall, it's a great place to hangout with friends. I had a good time, but it would have been better if she gave us a discount on the drinks since she completely forgot my drink."}
{"text":"Three stars cause the latte design is super cool!!!However was disappointed, because they were out of most deserts I wanted to try."}
{"text":"I think I would have enjoy Initium more if I am here for a hair cut and enjoying a latte.

Arriving here around 3 pm on a weekday and the salon was busy with patrons. I can hear the hairdryer going. The customers/hairdresser chit chat. The smell of the chemicals...

Matcha Latte was ok with a cute Pikachu stencil art. Quite pricey at $5.45 for the experience.

Mabybe coming here when the salon is closed for the day, the experience might be totally different."}
{"text":"Lovely place for late night munchies or afternoon study sessions. The space itself is super cute with an amazing playlist that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster as you are enjoying your delicious food. 

If you are need of a haircut THEN YOU ARE IN LUCK because initium offers hair salon services so you can freshen up that hair of yours if you are too full from eating. 

I highly recommend trying the Initium Signature Toast as well as the Japanese Naan Pizza. The drinks are also very delicious and Instagram worthy since you can have any photos or messages printed onto them (Coffee Ripples). 

The menu is flavourful and the service is on point. I can't wait to come back to give their hair salon a shot while enjoying a delicious cotton candy latte!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a long overdue haircut - skilled stylist and best hair wash ever! Great service at the cafe too :)"}
{"text":"This spot is combined with a hair salon. The space is small but cozy, modern and stylish. Seats are comfortable and spacious. There's a selection of special coffees and lattes that they offer at their bar. Coffee comes with cute foam art. There's snacks and a small selection of croissants, toasts, and salads. The coffee was delicious and food was ok. The servers are super friendly. Overall good experience as the atmosphere and vibe was great!"}
{"text":"They salon and cafe combo is a pretty unique concept. I'm not sure how that works together but it seems to because the place was pretty busy! Personally, I don't like the blaring EDM in the background. This really isn't a place to work unless you have some noise cancellation headphones. My espresso was good although the shot was tiny compared to other places. The croissant and banana bread were pretty good, especially the croissant. It's freshly baked I think, which is why it took much longer to come out than I expected. The service was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"It is a pretty unique concept, they have café style food and drinks. Next to the café lounge in the same building they have a salon. The salon there is on the pricy side, and you must have a booking before going, and I believe their style is more towards modern Asian hair style. The lounge is pretty small, I think it has a capacity around 20-30 people max. Nice place for a mini gathering, and catching up with friends. The drinks were good, they do coffee art, you can ask for certain design and they will try to make it for you. The snack and food there is also pretty good, but expect it to be a smaller portion. Overall, I had a great experience at this place with my friends.

The salon is pretty expensive, considering the full service you get for the price. I can go elsewhere and pay for the same amount and get a better service.

Service: 4/5
Food: 3/5
Drinks: 4/5
Environment: 3/5

Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times and certainly getting addicted to this place. 

The first time I was drawn to this place, the cotton candy was the selling point for me. Cotton candy flavours of vanilla, blueberry, grape and etc can be added on top of any drink and what is not to love about that! 

Whatever you want in terms of latte art, this place will challenge themselves and do it. Now, they've really outdone themselves and added the coffee ripples feature. By simply downloading the Coffee Ripples app free for android and apple, YOU can now create your own coffee art! Though they are still in the baby phases of the feature to sort out all kinks, it is TOTALLY RAD! Of course when sharing the picture with my friends they all thought it was photoshopped but that's to show how amazing the feature is! Either upload an old picture or take a pic on your smartphone right then and there! They are the only place in Canada to have this concept so far. 

This place is located right next to initium salon and has free wifi, large projector tv's, board games and even hosts painting events! What is there not to love! I also can't thank the staff enough for all their shared knowledge and friendliness throughout every visit. Extremely genuine people.

In the words of my father, \"you better not get addicted.\" It's too late father, it's too late."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Not only can you get a latte with your face on it but you can also get a haircut.   The staff is super nice which makes it so much better and price wise it's very reasonable.  The drinks are also super yummy.  My friend loves the peanut butter chocolate latte."}
{"text":"Great drinks highly recommends green tea latte!! 
They also have special latte arts ! 

Place to watch any final sports game. This place is awesome!"}
