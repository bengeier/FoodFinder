{"text":"Achtung schließt um 20:00 Uhr! 

19:15 - ausm outlet in Toronto raus und bei yelp nach \"ribs\" in der Nähe gesucht und dabei auf diesen Schatz gestoßen. Unter Barbecue war er nicht zu finden. Puh. 

19:30 - meine Befürchtung 30 min vor Feierabend keine Rippchen mehr zu bekommen hat sich Gott sei Dank nicht bewahrheitet: herzliche Begrüßung des Chefs an der Theke: \"Hey wo seit ihr so lange geblieben?\"

 Im Gegensatz zu anderen Lokalitäten wird an der Theke bestellt und man bekommt das Essen dann an den Tisch gebracht. 

Das Essen war fantastisch. Die besten Fritten jemals und absolut Hammer Rippchen (jede Küche bringt einen anderen Geschmack rein)! Als Zugabe gab's noch zwei Zimt Täschchen. Ebenfalls klasse! 

Der Chef schaute immer mal wieder vorbei, um sich nach unserem Wohlbefinden und unserer Reise zu erkundigen. Zu den Rippchen gab's noch ein Schweinelätzchen :-P 

Top Preise, top Qualität, super Atmosphäre und ein Chef der den Aufenthalt zum Erlebnis macht! Was will man mehr!"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwich and redneck poutine. Staff seemed nice when I picked up the order.  Unfortunately our two orders of mac and cheese were so awful we couldn't even eat them.  Just plain pasta and chucks of cheese with no flavour.  I called to complain.   They didn't offer to correct it they just said sorry.  We may give it another shot but we won't get the mac and cheese ever again."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive. The brisket sandwich - on a pretzel bun - was tasty, fresh and generous. The fries were delicious and the corn bread on the side was simple but fresh and delicious too. It's what BBQ should be. Counter service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Most honest reviews are the ones with 3 stars. Anyone who said 4-5 probably have just never had better and that's ok just not the best judge. 2 stars removed for portion, price, taste (which wasn't BAD at all just not for the value imo).

Ordered sampler with some of everything talked about and their famous poutine. Brisket was interesting lol NO comparison to Adamson who has some of the best brisket I've ever tasted (don't take my word on anything go and try it and let us know). Hush puppies were nice but butter mix was uhhh yeah (not bad just weird when separated lol). Poutine was ok, even Mess Hall across the street has some better ones imo and Acton food truck has the BEST pulled pork poutine this side of town (Open only during summer, like I said don't just read go try it and tell me I'm wrong). Ribs were ight nothing was stand-off but nothing was bad either

Service was amaZing, super friendly, helpful and polite but adjust portions to match price or lower price and it'd be alright they seem to have a following that enjoys their taste, got some cool sauces and a co-sign so I think they'll be alright"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a case of the meat sweats this is definitely the place to go! The pulled pork, ribs, and rotisserie are extremely tasty. We love the buffet of BBQ sauces to accompany your meat selection. 

The redneck poutine is fantastic. Huge and filling! Chicken tenders are ok, the typical frozen and deep fried kind, but not terrible. Portions are big, and prices are reasonable. 

I know they get their ground from Pat's (our favourite butcher) and he's got the freshest meat around! It's self serve, so you order at the counter. They get busy and sometimes that slows down food delivery but everything is hot and fresh when it arrives at your table. 

It's hard to call ahead for take out as they are often too busy to answer the phone."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I had the Burger and fries. The fries are some of the best French fries I have every had. 

I would drive back to Georgetown just to go here. Owner came out and talk to us for a couple minutes and he was very nice ."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Hungry Hollow on numerous occasions since I began working in Halton Hills. The main course items on the menu are truly great. Brisket sandwiches, pulled pork etc. They also have a great selection of bbq sauces, a little something for every taste. Their drink cooler is fully stocked with cold beverages both alcoholic and non. Service staff always greet with a smile and a friendly suggestion on which item to try. 

The only area the \"Hollow\" falls short in is their side dishes. Macaroni and cheese, baked beans and the rest always leave a little bit to be desired. 

That being said don't let that dissuade you from checking this place out. 

It's really great."}
{"text":"Great authentic Southern bbq offerings.  Flavourful,  well seasoned, great sauces and good size portions. 
Skip the fish and chips as they are a disappointment but everything else I have had was very good."}
{"text":"I'm a Toronto food snob so take it for what it is. Ordered a half slab of ribs with cornbread and beans. With \"smokehouse\" being in the name of the joint, I expected that the ribs would be smoked but I didn't smell, see or taste any of it. Meh, I ate it any way. I guess this is what you get in Georgetown..."}
{"text":"Execllent flavour poutine.  I LOVE the pull-pork and brisket poutine- probably the best pouinte Ive had to date.  I love the generous portion too for a great price.  The restaurant is small and its difficult to accommodate large groups so make your reservations before heading over."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my first visit here since I'm a huge southern food aficionado and I can't resist some good BBQ. This is a nice local joint which is clean, friendly, service was great.

The only thing that was missing for me was the food. I had the brisket which was very salty, not overly tender, sliced thick and drowned in sauce. The pulled pork was similar; not all that smokey and most of the flavour came from the sauce rather than the meat. It's like something you would get at your local Ribfest. Which is fine if that's what you're looking for--and in Georgetown it's the best you'll get--but I left feeling a bit unfulfilled. Maybe I'm just spoiled.

One thing I noticed there was that it seemed few people were eating the BBQ. I saw a lot of poutines, burgers, and fries flying around. If I go back again, I'll try that."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ North of Texas. Always fresh and large delicious portions. Great homemade sauce selection available on the side. Daily specials. Fried Chicken is also delicious. Fairly priced. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Hungry Hollow a few times and I can say that I've never left disappointed. 

Killer Barbecue located in the small town of Georgetown worth the drive to there, or even if you're just in the area and looking for an amazing sandwich or something great to eat.

Not sure if they make their sauces are made fresh in house but it's really cool that they have a massive selection of sauces that you can choose to eat with your sandwiches. Carolina gold, Mesquite, Smoky Texas, Spicy BBQ and many more to tantalize your palette. 

The prices are actually really good here and the portion sizes are fantastic, so you feel you get the meal deserved for the value of your dollar. 

My most recent experience I had the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich and it once again was definitely melt-in-your-mouth beef served up on a nice soft bun a nice hearty portion perfect for a large that left me quite satisfied. 

Previously I've tried the pulled pork as well as shared a platter with a group of friends once. It was one of those challenge if you can eat in a certain amount of time type platters but it looks like it's been removed from the menu now.  But with that one I got to try the poutine which was really well done which is a rare thing to find outside of Quebec. 

I know that if I'm heading out Georgetown way I gotta make sure I leave room in my stomach because no trip to Georgetown for me is complete without a stop by the Hungry Hollow."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always so good, hot and fresh!  The Brisket and pulled pork are the best I've ever had.  Fries and chicken wings are really good too!  The owner is very friendly!  Good place to stop in for dinner or take home. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the barbecue plate with brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork was pretty good, but nothing to get overly excited about. The brisket, on the other hand, is knock your socks off crazy good. Mmm. I'm in love with that brisket. It's tender, saucy, flavourful, and has a really great mouthfeel to it. The onion rings were also unbelievably yummy. 

Very lovely staff there as well."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars often, but I really enjoyed Hungry Hollow.  They claim to have authentic Southern BBQ and being from Alabama I am pretty skeptical of the places up here since most are a far cry from authentic.  This place hits the nail on the head and even has fresh brewed ice tea which is almost impossible to find outside of my own home around here.  You can smell the smoke when you walk in which is always a good sign.  I got the pulled pork dinner which comes with fries and 2 sides.  I substituted cornbread for the fries and got the baked beans and cole slaw.  The cornbread was a generous sized muffin and cooked perfectly with just the right touch of sweetness.  The beans were delicious and had a decent amount of pulled pork in them.  The cole slaw was creamy, tasty, and NOT neon green like most places up here.  The pulled pork was a huge serving and very good.  They had a large selection of BBQ sauces to choose from and I went with the Kansas City.  The only thing missing would be a honey BBQ sauce instead of honey garlic which is more of an Asian flavor to me.  

I would definitely go back even though I live all the way over in Pickering and this place is in Georgetown out west of Toronto.  It is worth a special trip even.  It looks like a hole in the wall, but then all the really good BBQ places look that way.    You order at the counter and pay there which is quite common in the South too so you get a real true Southern experience.  

If you go out to the new Premium Outlet in Halton Hills, just take the east exit from their parking lot and go straight on 8th Line and it is only about a 10 minute drive away.  Skip the food court and treat yourself here."}
{"text":"Great food, nice quaint ambience, good service. The burgers are a great size and the Redneck Poutine was great as well. All in all a great meal with good food and good staff."}
{"text":"Drove by several times and finally dropped in with friend for dinner.  Pulled pork sandwich was perhaps the best I've ever had.  My buddy had a burger and the hillbilly hotdog (all beef dog covered with pulled pork, covered with coleslaw).  Burger was handmade (took 15 min.) but delicous, hotdog was a homerun too.  stonehamme ale on tap.  selfserve bbq sauce station was incredible.  Not a \"classy\" place by any means.  Place your order at the front counter, have a seat and it will be delivered. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great value for great bbq!  Worth the drive from Toronto just forgot to use the check in! That would have been a bargain!  Maybe they'll open a location in Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pulled pork. Fries are well seasoned. The meal I ordered came with cole slaw. It was pretty good. My husbands had Mac & cheese as a side. Didn't like it. Very bland. $10.95 is a good price for the massive amount of food included. Upgraded my fries to poutine for additional $2.95. A bit steep if you ask me. The cheese curds were authentic. Gravy tasty. For 3 pull pork meals with 2 upgraded to poutine and 2 cans of Pop was $45. In the future I will share a meal with my teenage daughter. Definitely too much food for one person unless you're my 6 ft 5 husband. He ate half of my sandwich on top of his meal."}
{"text":"SO good! I  keep my expectations on the low end when trying a new BBQ joint...needn't have worried when it comes to Hungry Hollow 
They have a great menu with a nice variety of meats and sides, everything is made in house including daily fresh cornbread and homemade ice tea that you can get with or without sugar; every BBQ place should offer that. There's a decent offering of beer and coolers as well"}
{"text":"Pig heaven is what I call this place. They are renowned for their pork ribs. They offer a variety of BBQ sauces to choose from. I enjoyed the wings with the St. Louis BBQ sauce. They were wonderful. Also had on another visit the ribs with the apple butter BBQ sauce, it was a 7 out of 10. They were a bit dry and tough for my taste. The onion rings were fantastic and so were the fries. I will have to give the ribs another try, because the ones I tried the first time were not on the mark. I highly recommend this spot it's worth giving it a try. The service is always friendly and quick. Great ambiance with all the pig and BBQ paraphernalia!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident over a year ago and have come back again when in the area... worth the drive if you're from out of town.

Love it !  We will always come back for the pulled pork.. yumm"}
{"text":"I visited here a little more in the past when I was in Georgetown more often. I came by today for a quick takeout...or so I hoped.

I ordered the beef brisket sliders, along with coleslaw and fries. I like how it includes fries and one choice one out of many sides. My wife wanted wings. I know this isn't fastfood takeout, but I was still expecting 10 minutes or so. Most of the meat is pre-cooked after all, being a BBQ joint. There was only one cook and as I looked around I could see a number of tables with no food. Not a good omen. I wouldn't say the cook was doing nothing, but his pace didn't really match the need. Long story short, I was there nearly 40 minutes. In the last few minutes of that, someone who seemed like the owner/manager jumped in. Lo and behold: the cook's pace also increased.

The food: The two sliders were the same cost of the regular sandwich. The cashier said the sliders were about the same size combined, but they were a bit easier to eat. I've had their pulled pork sandwich before, and I can say that these two small sliders were a ways off from matching the sandwich portion - the meat in particular. My order seemed to be the last of that rush, so the brisket was barely warm. I could tell it was good quality, but the temperature of the meat and low quality bun really scaled it down. Very good fresh-cut fries and coleslaw however.

The wings were ordered medium since my wife isn't much of a heatseeker. However, they were quite mild and we should've ordered hot. They were pretty good - albeit unspectacular. On another note, it's really cool that they have a least a dozen unique BBQ sauces you can serve yourself with.

I'm awarding a generous '3' since my other experiences have been a '4'. However, if anyone had a similar experience to what I had today, they'd be a bit stumped as to the high rating."}
{"text":"Reviewed this a while back and the post was removed. Decided to go back and give the place a second chance because not everyone can get it right the first time and ive been proven wrong in the past by other places but to be honest I would not go back. very over cooked and over priced, the only reason it has good reviews is from the locals whos only other options are a mcdonalds or other fast food chains so go figure ."}
{"text":"Honestly I feel that  I just waste 24$ in this place!!
This people need to try Jamaican barbecue chicken and then compare it with what they do!
Awful chicken taste"}
{"text":"Portions are good, flavour is what one looks for in smokehouse food.  The environment is a bit weird, with no table service, making it feel like a fast food burger joint.  You'll need to get up and go over to the cash to order an alcoholic beverage and selection is very limited.  There are also not a lot of veggie options and an overload of carb options.  Overall a good experience, but not one that I would travel specifically for."}
{"text":"Damn good barbecue.

This place isn't classy, pretentious, or fancy. But the cooking is fabulous, the portions are insane, and the staff is friendly.

If these guys had a patio they'd be unstoppable."}
{"text":"Ok...here's the deal: if you don't go for the food (which is great!!) then go for the service! What a great bunch of people! But did I mention the food?? Omg! Amazing food, huuuuuge portions,  totally reasonable prices...seriously,  we ate like animals and took home enough to roll around in! Or eat for days...whatever!  Went for my 15 year old's birthday with the idea that it would be hilarious for him and his 2 friends to try to eat the challenge platter, and we ALL (grandmother, parents, little brother..) had such an amazing time thanks to the owner and the staff! They didn't even come close to finishing the platter but who cares?? They'll never forget it! You gotta eat here!! (The brisket is frickin amazing, btw)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant one day when we tried driving along Bovaird Rd in Brampton to see where we might end up. Are we ever happy we found it! It's my new favourite for BBQ. 
I almost always get the brisket, either a sandwich or alone (with fries, of course). I love that they have different sauces that you can try. My current favourite (as of my last visit on the weekend) is called Burning Bush. It's a smoky barbecue flavour which I love.
My cousin and I say we will try something else the next time we go but why mess with a good thing? :)
They often feature a dessert which is a nice touch. A few months ago, it was a coconut cream pie which I absolutely loved. 
The owner is often on site and he's friendly and helpful and always jokes around with customers and staff alike. The staff are super-helpful and friendly too."}
{"text":"Great food!  The pulled chicken and pulled pork are amazing. Suggestion - addition of televisions to watch sports games would be a big draw."}
{"text":"Very solid bbq! I have been to various traditional bbq places in the southern U.S. so unfortunately I have to say this place is definitely not a 4 or 5...but I have not found anything outside of the deep South that is worthy of a 4 or 5 so a 3 is not a bad rating!

The service is very good despite it being only partial table service. Another definite bonus, they have like 8 different sauces that you can help yourself to and they are all very different and quite good!

A tip: do not put extra sauce on the ribs! They are better as they come! I usually like to slather my ribs in sauce when I get them (love my sauce!) but these ribs are better eaten the way they arrive!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in town, amazing food and great service at an affordable cost"}
{"text":"Amazing pulled pork sandwiches and a wide variety of sauces to use!  One of the biggest pulled pork poutines I've seen...definitely a hidden gem in Georgetown."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance today to have of the best pulled pork sandwiches i ever had! Oredered pulk pork sandwich with a coleslaw and it was perfectly smoked, great balance of saltiness and bbq sauce on a warm pretzel bun! Can't wait to taste their beef brisket! Met the head chef Tom who was very polite and friendly and their great stuff:)"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 star. Fast service, very friendly and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend. Pulled pork and brisket were both delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a pulled pork sandwich for the longest time and this is where I ended up, first time trying a pulled pork and unfortunately I was disappointed, I was hoping for a savoury moist sandwich but it was bland and slightly dry. The chicken was on point though, fries were well seasoned and the shop itself is cute but there isn't anything out of the ordinary here!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Hungry Hollow and had a wonderful time from the friendly greeting which was received when we arrived to the delicious food that we ate. I would highly recommend their ribs (sauce is delicious and so moist), corn bread, wings (not to heavily battered) and barbecue chicken. There are also seven different types of BBQ sauces for you to try with your meats which added a very nice touch. Reservations are recommended on weekends. For the cold winter months ahead, get your BBQ at this place or all year long!"}
{"text":"I've been to a number of BBQ establishments and this place is  nowhere near as good.  Since it is the only one on Georgetown you take what you get but there is no Smokey taste and the ribs and pulled pork were tough. Memphis BBQ in Milton is really good for example,  you can really taste the smoke and everything there just falls off the bone and super tender"}
{"text":"We ended up at HHS after spending a wonderful day checking out the Caledon area and its fall foliage. One of the few places with good reviews in the area was this place and we decided to go for it...What an AMAZING place! 

Food is absolutely to die for. Juicy meat, perfectly cooked burger and tasty home fries. Sauces galore. (My only qualm is that I found the refried beans a little too sweet).

Mike is an awesome host who ensures that his clientele is satisfied and everyone else provides prompt service with a smile and some genuine jokes.

The atmosphere is very inviting and the pigs of all shapes and sizes are so funky! 

This place is definitely worth a stop and repeats for some authentic Southern cookin'."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why you NEED to eat here. 1) amazing barbecue, from brisket to ribs, everything is sublime. 2) affordable and fairly priced, with incredibly huge portions. 3) The owner and his staff are polite, amazing, and frankly the most hospitable people you'll meet at most establishments. They are always certain to walk to your table and make sure everything is alright, even though it is more of a southern bbq vibe where you pay before your meal, they still ensure you're enjoying it well after you've paid, sat down, and ate.

I returned here today, seeing as I live well out of town I make sure to always make a stop at the Hollow. They were incredibly busy, we decided to get take out, and we're not disappointed. I got the Brisket Sliders which comes with fries and a side (try the cornbread, it's fantastic). The sliders were moist, warm, and basically fell apart in my mouth. The fries were warm, not completely crunchy (which I like) and truthfully should have been upgraded to their Redneck Poutine, which is out of this world.

I have never had a poor eating experience from the Hollow, and I have been going here since just after they opened. It is a frequent of my friends, my family, and anyone who enjoys great, affordable food. Michael has an amazing restaurant that keeps me and my family coming back, and I assure you as long as he continues to make delicious brisket, pork and unbelievable burgers, we will continue to visit and support this superb locally owned business."}
{"text":"Mmm Mmmm Mmmmm brisket you'll thank me later, definitely grab their mac n' cheese as a side as well.  The portions you get are ridiculous!  Expect to have left overs, bbq all day with Hungry Hollow."}
{"text":"Brisket was awesome juicy and tender. Hush puppies were pretty good too. Selection of sauces a nice treat. Found the pulled pork a little dry."}
{"text":"You never know what you'll find in small places like Georgetown...

The second you enter there is no question as to where you are.  They seem to have collected every pig-related memorabilia to decorate with and it really gives the place a charm and transports you to the south.

The menu has more than what you need.  Priced well for how full you'll be.  I've yet to go as far as the redneck poutine, but I've had the pulled pork, brisket, hush puppies, beans and unsweetened iced tea.  I do miss the little keg they had for the iced tea.  Plenty of great sauces to add to your meal.  Jeez, writing this makes me want to go back right now!  Anyway...the main features, such as pulled pork and brisket, are on point.  I won't compare it to more gourmet places, because that's not fair.  They do a solid job delivering the classics.

Service isn't much to brag about as it depends who's working.  I've had great friendly service, or slow passive service."}
{"text":"FOODIE FRAUD ALERT:  These guys were on You Gotta Eat Here-Dont go here!!!   Clearly they were serving left over, dried out bones with bone dry meat? On them.  I wont call them by their common name - so bad.   For a place that is a 'bbq' place and are being endorsed by a popular foodtv show and not cheap...unbeleavable.  The brisket was like they scooped pre sliced pieces from a presauced buffet table bucket full of sauce and pieces.   

Oh..they make you pay too and walk up to counter before the food arrives... hmmm.......   positive note though onion rings were 9/10 quite amazing, bbq chicken better than average- nice smoke flavour and actually juicy fresh."}
{"text":"This place is no joke. Real BBQ cooked by real pit masters. amazing food, amazing atmosphere and most importantly amazing people. Beautiful service, make sure to order in advance, they are not joking about cooking BBQ the right way, low and slow and took 50 min for my order to be done. Will come back, thank you for all your hospitality Mark."}
{"text":"Tip:  10% on your order with Yelp Check-in, YAAASSS!  Just do it.

Casual, order at the counter, BBQ place in Georgetown that's great for a post-hike stop-over.  Definitely has a \"local feel\" to it!  

In terms of the menu, there's a lot of combo options that are great at accommodating a group.  So bring your appetite.  :)

Our table ordered a 1/4 Chicken Dinner (w/ fries + 1 side) and a 1/2 Chicken Dinner (w/ fries that I upgraded to poutine + 2 sides).

Poutine - Gravy was a bit on the salty side and although cheese were curds, they weren't squeaky.  Fries weren't all that crispy.  So good tasting, but not on par with Montreal.

Chicken - Tender, not dry, but the parts that weren't covered in sauce was a bit bland.  Luckily, they have a BBQ Sauce Bar, self-serve, and this was definitely a helpful addition!

Coleslaw & Cornbread - Both really good.  Coleslaw wasn't too heavy tasting and cornbread was just slightly sweet.

Service was friendly and smiley.  I'd definitely go back to check out other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had in the GTA. The beef brisket was absolutely PERFECT -- it literally could not be better.
I got takeout and by the time I got home the redneck poutine was a bit cold and dry but I'm sure it's great fresh. I expected it to have more gravy from the pictures on the menu, but it just had a bit of BBQ sauce with the cheese and pulled pork.
Other reviews said this place was a hole in the wall, but I disagree -- the atmosphere inside was perfect. The other BBQ places I've been to were 10x more rundown.
The big reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is a) the prices.. quite steep for the portions (e.g. $6 for upgrading the fries to a poutine) and b) I ordered takeout and picked 2 sides, and when I got home realized I didn't get either of my sides, which was really disappointing because my bill came to $26 for one person.. 
Anyway, next time I'll be happy to 'settle' for just the brisket because though the pulled pork was good, the brisket was the killer.
I will return, but I'll double check my order next time I get takeout.


PS they have a large selection of pops other than what's listed on their online menu."}
{"text":"Having read the other reviews....I just don't believe that a 5Star rating for this restaurant is even true.
I went there with my son, our 1st visit and things didn't fit with me. We had to order at the counter then have a seat and then the waitress would bring our order. At the counter, before we got our meal we had to pay. I paid by debit and interestingly enough there was a TIP OPTION as well that came up on the keypad. I asked the waitress, \" there shouldn't be a tip option before we have had any service....she seemed dumbfounded! 
Our food was delivered to our table and it looked like a HEAP OF PUT TOGETHER IN THE BACK KITCHEN CRAP, a lot of quantity but definitely no quality!!
I ordered the brisket sandwich, came smothered with a sauce because it was so dry, terrible,
My son ordered a large redneck poutine. Again, a lot of fries and a mound of pulled pork. Too much food really sacrificed on quality. He didn't eat too much of it.
Bad service.
Get better napkins rather than the paper roll on the tables, scrapes our face let alone wipe with it.
Too pricey for level of ' non-service'
If the owner reads these reviews , I would make a suggestion: get rid of the option of ordering at the counter, it cheapens the restaurant and the waitress/ waiter usually is cheated on tips."}
{"text":"This place is quaint.  It's on the smaller side, and located in a plaza of sorts. 

The food is decent and priced well, but while there is a wait staff, you still have to go up and order your food...and pay for it at the counter before you're served. 

The ribs were over cooked and judging from the other customers when we were there we were not the only ones complaining. The wings were decent. (Mild/medium were softer, the mesquite was crunchy,  so depending on your wing preference!) The cornbread - Stellar!  Do indulge in the cornbread!!! 

Makayla was our waitress and she was super friendly despite being busy during the dinner rush!"}
{"text":"We had a very good BBQ experience at Hungry Hollow Smokehouse.
The ribs were meaty an the sauces were good. We also had the pulled pork sliders which were also very good. I think the best item was their Redneck Poutine, lots of pork and cheese on home made fries. I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Took a trip out to Limehouse and it was the best decision ever to stop by hungry hollow!   Amazing,  friendly service,  and a very satisfying meal.   Well-cooked and very generous portions."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant very frequently. The food is delicious. I have eaten the big daddy burger, delicious and cooked perfectly everytime. Its alot of food for one person but its damn good. The onion rings are fresh and made to order so no generic frozen onion rings here. The fries are chipped on site and made fresh everyday, some of the best fries I've ever had. The coleslaw is creamy and crunchy very good if you like creamy coleslaw. The red beans and rice are spicy and well cooked. The corn bread is warm soft and sweet excellent to wipe your plate down with. The hush puppies are like little savory timbits that come with a sweet butter to spread on them, excellent with your meal or as a small dessert if you have room. The pulled pork is to die for and when you can smell when they open the smoker your mouth starts to water. The brisket is also amazing its tender and well cooked and delicious. The ribs are tender and sweet and are easily the best in town.
The staff are second to none, they all present a warm, welcoming and caring attitude even when the restaurant is jammed with people. They make excellent recommendations for what to eat. Mike and Laura are the owners of the restaurant and while Mike is out making sure you're happy with everything youve got, Laura is behind the counter making sure everything is getting out in a timely manner. For thos who complain about 40 minute waits, everything is made fresh and to order, everythis is alwas good and its worth the wait. If you don't want to wait, call ahead for pickup or make a reservation."}
{"text":"Delicious Southern food. 

Ordered Pulled Pork sandwich for lunch with authentic southern iced tea which came with fries and one side of your choice. I opted for mac & cheese which was not too cheesy but delicious. 

Wasn't expecting a huge portion size but it was quite big and filling. Would definitely come back here if I am ever in Georgetown and try the Redneck Poutine."}
{"text":"Absolutely insane. My friend & I made the short trip out here from Mississauga after reading the great reviews. Ordered the Beef brisket dinner w/ Mac & cheese, coleslaw & cornbread. Took just under an hour for the food. Place your order before coming to avoid standing around, but well worth the wait. They have a bunch of different BBQ sauces you can try out. The owner Mike & the rest of the staff were incredible. I can see them getting a bigger space as it gets more popular. Best BBQ I had in my life."}
{"text":"Went to Hungry Hollow again a few days ago during the evening. Seating was entirely occupied, literally only 6 tables in the whole joint. Looked at the menu, prices went up 50% !!!!!! Red neck poutine is almost $20 now. Everything went up $$$$$$.
Looked at other people's orders, portions are reduced.
Looks like the owner, who's a former insurance fraud snitcher/ investigator is milking the \"you gotta eat here\" show big time. A real shame his greed has completely altered the dining experience in Hungry Hollow. It'll be hard to roll back the prices, next step - outta businees by 2019 guaranteed. Owner should still be in inusrance, he taketh but does not giveth."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is amazing. The poutine was ok. The gravy doesn't really have any flavor and the cheese curds weren't melted at all. 
Would for sure come back for the pulled pork tho."}
