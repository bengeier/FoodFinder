{"text":"Great local Mexican food. Happy hour $2 Bud Lights from 3 to 5pm Monday thru Friday. I enjoy their fajitas. Coupons in local circulars. Good service."}
{"text":"Spotted this restaurant on Yelp, so had to try it.  Well worth it!  Ordered enchiladas carnitas and they were outstanding. Terrific service too."}
{"text":"I've been here two times since it's been opened. Best American Mexican food I've had in the area.   The only con is I wish that they would remodel the bathroom"}
{"text":"Really great lunches,Love the warm chips and salsa while we wait.Tamales are the real deal :) Not so much the ground beef offerings.Shrimp special dinner is amazing."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the area the guacamole is to die for.great value can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Always good service and good food at fair prices.  Miss the location being in Mentor."}
{"text":"Very dirty place all around. Dead insects covering the window sill on top of the built up dust. I couldn't wait to finish my very mediocre margarita and get out of there. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"great Mexican food at great prices. loved the Chicken Chipotle !!! will be back to try other dishes !!!  UPDATE 5/4/13:  i have been back and apparently, word has caught on.  there were many more patrons.  let me say their salsa is the BEST i have ever had (and the queso is pretty darn good too).  this is my new favorite Mexican restaurant !!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant and \"sports bar\" doesn't serve liquor (margaritas or sangria) on Sundays but they don't bother to tell you that until after you've been seated and eaten some chips and salsa. We were tricked into eating here and lured under false pretenses :( Great service from a very nice and apologetic waitress and okay food. Bathrooms were very dirty."}
{"text":"one of the best Mexican places ever. let's just say, their food is almost as good as bron is at bball!! no, but seriously, their food rules! great margaritas! good service and prices! eat here, you wont be disappointed! go cavs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've gone to this restaurant 3 times now. The last time we went, we went with 11 of our friends and family.  Everyone raved about there food and the service. The staff seems to really care about this business and it shows.  It has quickly become our favorite Mexican spot and I highly recommend it.  It's a large enough place that we've never had to wait to be seated on Saturday. They take reservations and they can cater to a large group."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to give this place a try. Clean and neat restaurant. Staff was super friendly.   Chips and salsa immediately arrived at the table. Both were good! I ordered chicken enchiladas. They were amazing and had great flavor. My husband ordered some special (of course I can't remember the name) the waiter asked him if he was hungry. Four plates came out!!! Tacos, enchiladas, poblano and other stuff that I can't remember. I tasted his shredded beef taco and it was really good!!   We will be back! I think we found our new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"El Palenque has fast service, the rice has good texture. Their quesadillas are very tasty.  Prices are good and you get a lot of food.  Staff is friendly.  This restaurant is on my top ten list.  I really like this place."}
{"text":"Use to be very good when  it was in Mentor-on-the-lake.  When it first moved to Eastlake it was pretty good, but has been going down hill since.  Last time we went there it was horrible, service was poor and the food was inconsistent.  Do not plan to go there.  Have been to Coco Locos and the food and service is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Good feel when you walk past the door of a strip mall style location.  Clean and cared for.  Young staff were very pleasant.  Chips and salsa were good and fresh.  Ordered two burritos - chicken and beef.  Chicken burrito was pretty good but ordinarily Americanized.  Beef burrito was ok but it was not shredded nor ground beef...more like chopped super fine so it was mushy.  Great Mexican music playing.  3 or 4 good sized TV's with sports.    I like authentic Mexican food that's not super Americanized - this is one of the Americanized restaurants - but better than the chains."}
{"text":"I picked up my daughter in Mentor for dinner because I'm an awesome dad! When she said she wanted Mexican I looked pensively out my car window. Awesome dad needed awesome Mexican for awesome daughter. So what did I do??? I YELP'd. Not out loud, but digitally. Bing, bong, Boom and I had a four star Mexican restaurant programmed into Imaps.  The parking in front was packed so we were \"pensive\" about how crowded it might be. What the what!?! Inside was pretty big and they had stools at the bar, cool I know. Awesome daughter and I sat at the bar because that's the awesome section. We started with Queso Fundido and yummy it was. Cheese dip with nothing but delicious inside. My untrained pallet would pour it over my socks and they would smell and taste delicious. Worth breaking bad on the diet. Lobster Chimichang's were very awelicious. Lobster, Spinach, Cheese wrapped in a pillow of tasty love.  Yes I was super awesome for YELPING and wise for taking all the credit for it. I will return to sit in the awesome section. Feel free to wave or hi-five me."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the area!! The food always tastes great, unlimited chips and salsa, the margaritas are also delicious. The service has always been good and the employees are a lot of fun on Cinco de Mayo and on birthdays! Went here for my 21st bday! Also, you can't beat the prices. During the spring/summer they have a really nice patio area that you can enjoy your meal on.  They also do a reward system where your tenth meal is free. They also offer coupons on Groupon!"}
{"text":"My family and I are so happy that Noelia and her family have reopened on Vine St. Camarones del Pacifico is the greatest Mexican dish ever made !!!!"}
{"text":"Bad  very very bad.Food quality below Taco Bell .. When the food came it looked like the waiter fell down on the way to our table . I think the waiters are all related to each other and Tuco Salamonca. The name El Palenque should be changed to  Los Grandes Calambres."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican restaurant on the east side. Affordable prices, large portions, and strong margaritas.   I have came here for years and seen So Palenque grow, and grow. Conveniently located off route 2, right next to classic park, this place has a complete menu, specifically vegetarian options I adore.    Their house salsa is good, but the chili con queso is great. A pitcher of any flavored margarita will make for a night of fun for any couple (peach, frozen is my personal favorite). Monday is dollar taco day and they are much better than the run of the mill tacos. My wife loves their chicken enchiladas and burritos (both bean and chicken) more than any other restaurant. I favor the vegetarian #22 which is a cheese enchilada, cheese quesadilla, and Mexican rice.  Since I started coming they have added more staff, a spacious outdoor patio, and expandaded their liquor license to serve on Sundays. They offer gift certificates and I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here for roughly 20 people and we all left satisfied."}
{"text":"All said and done, you go to a place for the food. If you serve me excellent food, I will return. That being said, El Palenque is a middle of the class mexican restaurant in the Mentor on Lake area. If you've been to any of the many Mexican restaurants (Don Tequilas, Jalapeno Loco, etc.) this does not differentiate itself much. You get a good Burrito at a good price.  Nothing wrong with this place, but nothing outstandingly right either - worth a one try at least!"}
{"text":"Chipotle chicken was amazing! Standard salsa is good, hot tomatillo salsa is excellent. Staff was friendly and there was no communication issue speaking in English. The menu looks pretty solid, we will be back again!"}
{"text":"It's Americanized Mexican food. Exactly what anyone would expect really. Fairly clean, large eating areas, and responsive staff. Its ok."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience!  Bad food, very dry and tasteless, poor service, no refills and very dirty bathrooms, no toilet paper!!! I would never recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Everything we had was absolutely delicious! Cheese dip, chicken chipotle, steak/chicken fajitas, salsa, mango/regular margarita! Definitely recommend this place! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They were able to accommodate a party of 7 and the entrees were good but drinks were not.  They were out of the strawberry puree so i had a watermelon margarita & it wasn't good. I even tasted the house margarita & that had too much syrup for my liking. I got the cucos chicken and was delicious, too huge to finish. Another person in our group ordered the quesadilla but it wasnt grilled on the outside so he was unhappy with his \"soft taco\" essentially."}
{"text":"I really liked this place when it first opened but the last couple of times I've been there the food quality went way down.  The Margaritas are watered down and they can't make a decent Chili Relleno.  I ordered one where the flour/egg coating wasnt cooked so it tasted like raw flour, and the last time they just gave up and wrapped the Poblano pepper in an omelet!  I'm not going back unless they find new management."}
{"text":"This place frickn rocks.... the food was sooooo good i'm definitely coming back.... highly recommend !!! Try the Texicana Margarita ..... wahooo!!!!"}
{"text":"I now have a new favorite Mexican restaurant. The food here is awesome and the service is great. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican food in my book. Our go to Mexican restaurant was Jaliscos in Eastlake, but unfortunately they closed. They had the best complimentary white dipping sauce for their chips. I don't know the ingredients and we miss it. We went to El Palenque because we were told they have the same sauce, but they did not. We always order the fajitas to share, usually with steak and chicken, and sometimes shrimp.  They were nothing special but good I guess. We have only been there once and aren't planning on returning. My husband said the bathroom was filthy. A good thing about Mexican restaurants in general is the lack of waiting for a seat though."}
{"text":"Very nice place to get Mexican food and drinks. The service is really fast and friendly. I particularly enjoy the chicken fajitas and chips here."}
{"text":"My family will only go here for Mexican food. The service is always fast and friendly, food tasty and a good value. Margaritas are the best in the area. The salsa is the best not just in the area, but best I've ever found. Well run establishment that never disappoints. In summary, it's our happy place. Muchos gracias, El Palenque! My daughter says: I love El Palenque"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!  There is a huge bar to sit at with 2 TV's available. Then, there are several dining areas to accommodate groups of all sizes! In each area there are TV's too.  There's like 8 TV's in this place!!  And best part is: THEY HAVE A DECK!! Who knew!  A guy said it was just finished and almost ready to open. That will be great when the captains are playing because the view is pretty good!   Now, to the food: wow! It's sooo good!  Try the items off the \"secret menu!\" I got the street tacos! Grilled chicken, chorizo, and pineapple stuffed into soft corn tortillas to make up this mouth watering dish.  My girlfriend got the super burro which was HUGE! I took a bite and it was delicious. Beans, lettuce, onions, tomato, sour cream and choice of meat (she got steak) were all stuffed into a big flour tortilla then topped with this cheesedip salsa mixture.  It was super good!  We got margaritas too. There is a lot to choose from. I chose a handmade signature margarita while my girl got an octopus margarita. It was frozen margarita mixed with sangria. It looked really cool.  And the service was great! Our waitress was really friendly, knew about the different dishes, and always had a smile on her face! The place was busy too so that is a great sign that this place KNOWS what they are doing! I really recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"I must say they really stepped up their game .tried it when they opened then a few weeks ago huge difference for the better. Cool beans!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this week while in the Mentor, OH area on a business trip.  I found the atmosphere to warm and inviting.  Was greeted at the front door and the server was attentive and provided great service during my meal.  I tried the super burrito with chicken and found it to be hot and delicious.  Chips and salsa were plentiful and cost of the meal was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim for a Sunday evening dinner. My hubby and I had the patio all to ourselves, which was a nice reprieve from the loud, obnoxious family circus inside, complete with screaming fatties. The eye candy server was prompt and courteous. To my own dismay, I forgot about the dumb ass laws in Lake County, OH about no liquor sales on Sundays. No margaritas for me. Only serving cervezas, which I wasn't in the mood for. Onward, I ordered a huge grande burrito, vegetarian style. It was a monster, filled with onions, tomatoes, zuchinni and the kitchen sink. It was very tasty smothered with a white cheese sauce. Hubby ordered some dish with shrimp, scallops, rice and a side of tortillas, lettuce, guac and tomato. It was really tasty as well. The chile relleno was just meh. Typical Mexican cuisine...good, but not fantastic, but I would return to try their margaritas."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place tonight. It is definitely the best Mexican food I've ever had in the state of Ohio! We had the seafood fajitas and the tamales. They were both excellent. The service was great and the food came out fast. We highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere come and bring your family and friends. This place has a full bar with excellent service and alcohol"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I'm usually with my toddler. Which usually makes for a hectic dining experience. This place is amazing to take kids for lunch or dinner. They're super accommodating and the food comes out very quickly. Great food and great prices. They have fun drinks for children and adults, we'll definitely be back! Best Mexican food on this side of town!"}
{"text":"My first time here and boy am I glad I went.   I went on a Friday afternoon between lunch and dinner.  Upon being seated, I received an order of warm tortilla chips and salsa...yum!  I ordered the lunch Chicken Fajitas which arrived hot and fresh, accompanied by guacamole, lettuce, sour cream, rice and re-fried beans.   The portion was VERY generous, especially for lunch.   I also ordered a regular margarita, which was pretty large.   Entree and drink, totaled roughly $14 with tip.....not bad at all.  I\"ll be  back....soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have always been haooy with the food and service. It's my favorite place!!"}
{"text":"First off let me say I've never been here before today. But I was don't impressed with the service and the quickness of the delivery of our food. Our server was patient and very nice. Good came out piping hit and was delicious. I'll definitely look to come here again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. When we got in we were greeted nicely and seated. I ordered a seafood enchilada which was really good the chips also are really good the salsa was tasty but wasn't my favorite it could've been a little more chunkier but the margarita was delicious and the service was friendly and prompt. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good food , very good service, and reasonable pricing ! Love to come here with my family, my favorite are the seafood fajitas."}
{"text":"If you are going to eat here then dine in. They prioritize their dining in patrons well above the take out orders. I've been here for well over an hour and have seen half a dozen tables wait then get seated, seated, eat, and leave. That's not how a kitchen should run when you offer both dinning in and out. Several others are in the same boat as me."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had in Ohio! Seafood nachos with crab, scallops, grilled peppers, and shrimp. Our server was wonderful and kept up with my loud group Of 9 without a flaw. Better get in her fast. Come November there might be a wall around it! ( I can climb)"}
{"text":"Took the family for lunch today.  Surprised that the restaurant wasn't busier.  We were seated right away, chips, salsa, water, and margaritas appeared quickly.  Service was fast, polite, and accurate.  Wife and I split the Stone Molcajetes (very nice presentation), daughter had the Pollo Loco, everything was very good.   Nice uncrowded seating area.  We were seated in a booth with the hard wooden slats where you get slammed in the back when someone sits down behind you.  Prices were higher than those shown on their website menu."}
{"text":"Good food!  However, the service was terribly S-L-O-W! We were there on a Saturday night. I expect restaurants to be marginally slower on a weekend night, but we sat over 15 min before we got drinks and ordered. It took well over 45 additional minutes for our food to arrive. I had the Enchiladas Hawaiian and my husband had a huge Pork Fried Burrito.  Both were very good."}
{"text":"This has been my family's go-to Mexican restaurant for the past year or so. We first found out about this place from getting coupons in the mail and finally decided to check it out after seeing all the good reviews online. One thing about El Palenque is the food comes out super fast. Usually your whole table's order will be out in about 7-10 minutes! And for good the prices, you also get pretty hefty portions as well.   They have a pretty wide range of vegetarian options which I love and they're very accommodating to any substitutions or exclusions. For those with a good appetite and wanting something delicious, check out their Super Burrito which is also available in vegetarian style. Don't forget to add the Suizo sauce, it makes it 10x better!  I'm only giving 4 stars because our last experience was the first time it was not so great. The food was good and everything, but the chips were incredibly stale and the service was less than decent, borderline rude. We had a waiter we'd never had before and I'll just say I hope we never have him again. The floor around our table was pretty dirty when we got there and we had to ask to get it sweeped up. It was also Cinco de Mayo and one worker had the nerve to say to us \"why would you even come here? This is our worst day of the year\".  A little off-putting, but it was unfortunately the truth."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This food is delicious!  I got the burrito with rice n beans and OMG!!!  I ordered some tamales also. The margaritas are strong and great too!!!! This place has exactly what I need for my Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"This has to be my 5th or 6th time here, lots of fun  My only 2 complaints are the booths are not very comfortable, and parking can be bad, Chase across the street doesn't like you parking in their lot  -chips and salsa, always refiled -Drinks are def. strong -Food is great, priced well -Can find typically a $5 off or so. -Service is excellent, quick -Atmosphere is what you would expect -Outdoor patio is nice  Great spot in Eastlake"}
{"text":"We were driving through the area and saw this place was rated fairly high. It did not disappoint! Fast and friendly service. We came on a night where big pina coladas were only $5. The pork was very tender and the burritos were gigantic! If we are in the area again, will definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"Very good food and margaritas. The staff was attentive. We had a great time here and will be returning. The parking sucks."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian selections. My husband enjoys the different meat entrees as well. Salsa is good. Food is great. Lets hope it stays this way. It seems that Mexican restaurants get crappy soon. Lets hope the food quality stays the same here!!!  Marco the bartender is awesome too. He introduced me to a good shot of tequila. Can't remember the name of it though."}
{"text":"The staff here is extremely friendly and welcoming. The food is pretty tasteful, but their taco mondays 99 cents... Super bland and plain. I would just avoid this overall and go for their menu food.  They do have traditional taqueria tacos here, but under a different name.  Locals in the area have no idea what tacos are like outside of this state, but  for the location its amazing and its pretty much like every other mexican place in the area.  Service is superb ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of the few Mexican restaurants that has really good food and a few unique menu items.  I ordered carnitas but did not want the rice or tortillas--high glycemic.   The carnitas were salty but the rest of the plate was perfect for me. Garnish was spicy, pork was soooo tender, and the beans are the right consistency.   The wait staff is friendly enough. Never had an incident. They were Johnny on the spot."}
{"text":"The lobster chimichangas here are God's gift to man. Food came out quick. Service was good. Salsa tasty. So glad we decided to try this place out. It will be my go-to place whenever I'm craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great, great service and delicious food. The tamales taste great. Pina Colada was perfect. My family will become regulars."}
{"text":"If you don't follow my reviews, then your missing out.    Alright, for those of you that follow my reviews, you already know that I'm brutally honest. Luckily this isn't a bad review. This is my second time visiting this restaurant within two weeks so I have a lot to say about.        Walking in, this place is really dark and it also has a full bar which looks really cool upon walking in. My friend and I waited to be seated and we where greet promptly my first visit but on my second visit my boyfriend and I waited a bit before the bar tender had to flag our waitress/hostess down. (No big deal) On my first and second visit I had huge tortilla chips and salsa that was brought out to us as soon as we were seated and we also ordered $5 guacamole. The salsa is a little too thin for my taste as well as too salty but I like that fact that it's fresh, at least it tastes like it. The GUACAMOLE is soooo good! Omg, it's the kind of food that makes you want to smear it all over your body because it's so good. It's so creamy, so chunky and so flavorful. And the lime in it is delightful it really gives it charater and that attitude like, \"Bitch you know I was just made fresh\", it's really that good.      The menu is overwhelming to look at I personally like to have a lot of choices to choose from but if you don't they do section the dishes off into sea food, chicken, steak and vegetarian. I ended up getting the Cazulada ($13.99) (I think that's how you spell it I'm not sure) and my friend got the lobster enchilada. The Cazulada, was amazing!!!! I was so happy I made the right choice. It's a good choice if your not sure what to get and you want to be on the safe side and have a combination of meats (chorizo, chicken and steak) onions and poblano  peppers and oh yeah, it's spicy! When it comes out it's sizzling; makes for a good presentation and comes with orange colored rice and pinto beans topped with cheese. The beans and rice was really good too. ** also I thought it was just me but but I was right my Cazulada was sooo salty. ( I'll get back to that)  For drinks I ordered the Tecate beer that's served with a lime and that was really good and really had a craving for a piña colada. The piña colada was gross!!!!! It tasted like creamy alcohol flavored wtf in a glass. So disappointed. I should have sent it back when I saw it because there is not mention on the menu about it having strawberries in it. I figured that it wouldn't be too bad of a combination but I was wrong, it wasn't what I wanted and it was too sweet and there was nothing coconut about it. Maybe loose the strawberry and add coconut cream.   My friend got the Lobster enchilada ($12.99) and I got a chance to have a bite of hers. The best way to describe the taste is a big plate of lobster and cream cheese stuffed wonton. It's tasty but entirely too rich for my taste, too creamy. It was served with rice, lettuce topped with sour cream, tomato and guacamole. My friend loved it and was surprised that the lobster was fresh and \"real\". She also said that she wanted to spread it over her body.   My boyfriend had enchilada with mole sauce, unfortunately I did it take a picture of it nor does he remember the name of it. Two where chicken and two where beef. Here's why: The enchiladas were horrible! It was upsetting to look at and even horrible to eat. We had never has mole sauce before and my boyfriend asked the waitress what to expect. She described the sauce as smokey and BBQ sauce like but not BBQ sauce. Ew, it had a sweet chalky taste to it and very dry and it did have a hint of sweetness to it. He had it sent back and went with the safest choice, the Cazulada. I hear it coming before I saw it and he was all smiles and the smell was still amazing. Again, my boyfriend was put off by the salt just like I was, so it wasn't just me. He was truly offended by the level of salt. With his experience and background dealing with a verity foods and chefs, I trust his opinion and someone needs to put down the salt and taste what they are serving. Your going to have to wash the salt down with a couple of drinks. No need for salt with your tequila.       I really wanted to eat the Cazulada again but I wanted to try something new, so I got the seafood chimichanga, so I thought... I don't know if mine was really a chimichanga seeing how it was supposed to be fried and it didn't seem fried to me but rather soggy. I think they confused it with the seafood enchilada. The shrimp was huge and the scallops were huge but I would have liked them to be sautéed just so they aren't too soft with the sogginess of the flour tortilla. The lobster was fake!!!! It tasted real when I had a bite of my friends lobster enchilada but (gag) it was fake lobster and I do not like the taste of fish and artificial coloring that's labeled imitation crab meat. Gross! I should have known better, it's very rare that restaurants serve real crab anymore in their dishes. Huge disappointment!    I"}
{"text":"So we decided for something different last Saturday night and Mexican it was ! We found a discount coupon for El Palenque so guess who won ?    I guess everyone with 100 miles also found a coupon too because the place was PACKED !  I mean it was no empty table full !!  The staff was racing around I mean they were RUNNING, but in complete control. Even the hostess and cashier were pitching in with table clearing and checking on tables so we weren't put off by the short wait.   We were seated in 10-15 minutes, didn't feel long at all. Within seconds the bowl of chips and salsa arrived, I'm set now.  Our server arrived to check on us pretty soon after despite how busy it appeared.  I stepped out of my typical comfort zone of chicken or beef and went all in on the lobster spinach Chimichanga's but requested the melted cheese compote on the side, I think the poured over goo just makes it all soggy. Well the food arrived and guess what, YEP melted cheese all over :(   I don't blame the kitchen I kind of have to lay it at the feet of the server since she repeated my order back to me to be sure before she left and she should checked it  before it was brought it out.  The Chimichanga's were very spinachy, the  lobster chunks were large and very lobstery tasting with plenty of lobster inside.  The rice and re-fried beans were great and the  tomato and lettuce on the plate was very fresh ...to be honest the lettuce was as crunchy as the chips :)   Overall it was a good dining experience and I'm sure we'll be going back but will I'll stick with a dish in my comfort zone."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place I am never disappointed. Great fast service, drinks are soo yummy and the fajitas are always tasty and hot and I look forward to coming every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and very decently priced. The reason this restaurant is getting 3 stars instead of the 5 star rating is because of their slippery floors. It seemed that someone washed the floors and never washed the soap off."}
{"text":"Luv Monday night $1tacos. Chicken soft are my fav. Put some salsa on them. Friendly waiters. Patio is nice, but there may be people smoking. Spinach enchiladas aren't great. Would be better if they used fresh spinach."}
{"text":"Food was hot and flavorful and a good value. Carnitas are always top notch.  Fajita combo was delicious.  Corona was ice cold with fresh and juicy lime.  Chips and salsa were at the table as soon as we sat down. One improvement: salsa was not refilled as quickly as preferred.  Overall, pleased with our experience.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple: mediocre Mexican food at best but HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. Randomly charge for stuff and give you a printed bill with no explanation. We came here on a Monday night and the restaurant only had maybe 10 other people in it. It took our rude waiter over 30 minutes to take our order, and that was after we asked him to come take it, wtf. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Serviceable Mexican at best. East side of Cleveland is full of Mexican joints and this place doesn't do much to stand out. Check out a handful of the other places. Salsa was runny and the fajitas just seemed to be missing something. Not terrible, but nothing that draws me back."}
{"text":"I'll preface this rating and review by saying that being new to the East side I am used to much better Mexican restaurants, on to the review. The salsa and chips were great, good flavor and a hint of spice.  The meal, was the real meh part.  The beans were not good at all, the flavor was just off.  Which is a bummer because I love to combine my rice and beans, so all I ended up doing was ruining my rice.  I got the entree with chorizo, steak, and chicken, but it was very bogged down by grease, which of course happens when you add chorizo, but it seemed excessive.   The service was ok not super friendly and we rarely got checked on. I think I'll just keep making trips to the West side to satisfy my Mexican cravings."}
{"text":"The east side version of el jalapenos on west 117. Food was fresh and delicious. Loved the thin crispy chips and salsa. The service could of been friendlier. Overall, a fun place in an unexpected area of town."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!!  So so good. I have been here at least 6 times since moving to the east side and it is easily my favorite Mexican place out this way.  The Margs are always delicious. And the staff is always friendly.   I highly recommend the enchiladas and fajitas.   They have great lunch specials and awesome drink deals."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is delicious- Authentic!! The best guacamole!   Very clean and nice atmosphere. The place is huge. Kid friendly.Kids eat free on Sundays too."}
{"text":"HB and I tried this place today and let me tell you. The food was excellent! Everything was hot and fresh, the lady who made our table side guacamole was nice as well. I ordered the canitas yummy and HB had the fiesta de la casa and he said his food was delicious also. We will be going back."}
{"text":"El Palenque has a unique menu, and their food is very good. The service is always kind, and they have a \"buy so many entrees, get one free.\""}
{"text":"Good authentic food as far the places I've been, servers are nice and portions are ample.   Please take note that if you eat light, one dish is more than enough for most people to share.  Over all, good food at a good cost for what you receive. I like coming back again."}
{"text":"We went back again. This time I ordered the Las Margarita Specials which consist of beef enchilada, pork tamales, chili rellenos, tostada and beef hard taco served with spanish rice and refried beans. The chili rellenos was very good. It was a little spicy with lots of cheese in the middle. Doesn't feel very heavy at all. The pork tamales is really food. It's very well balanced between the meat and masa. Very flavorful. I didn't care for enchilada and beef taco from plain ground beef. Nothing to wow about. The bean tostada  is really nice with refried beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole. The spanish rice is a little too salty for my personal preference. The color is great but too much salt for me. My wife ordered a veggie burritos and it's massive. Good variety of vegetables, rice, beans and cheese inside.   Washed it down with Texacana Margarita and Modelo Especial beer.  It's a great restaurant when you see a lot of Latinos eating. It's a good sign that it's a fairly good restaurant. There's daily specials and Saturday night after 4 pm is $12.99 pitcher of margarita.  Great food, great service."}
{"text":"This place is great. It replaced the dingy Wing Warehouse on Vine St. and we have been there multiple times. The normal fare on the mexican menu but things seem to taste a little different, maybe a little fresher. No matter what it is, it's an upgrade to the food offerings in Eastlake. Decent margaritas also, poured a little heavy :)"}
{"text":"We used to love this place.  Sadly, that has changed over the past few months.  The've either gotten new management, different chefs, or both.  The servers seem to be more worried about being watched by other employees (managers?) than by anything else.   Formerly, my husband and I each had our favorite meal.  He's still pretty happy with his, but mine no longer appeals to me.  The sauce is watery and the flavors are bland and too mixed.  I'm in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and excellent guacamole. This restaurant is great for eating and watching sports AND for family dining!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. They greet you with a warm bowl of tortilla chips that are crispy and fresh and salsa that tastes like they made it just for you.  The wait staff is friendly and the food comes out quick, hot and yummy.  One of my favorite places to relax and enjoy the cheerful atmosphere"}
{"text":"Our food was good as well as the service. My jalapeno burrito came out on a sizzling skillet. In fact, so many dishes came out of the kitchen on skillets I'm surprised EFD wasn't called. The parking is a little screwy. But my only real complaint is the booths are flimsy. When the guy behind you leans back it pushes you forward. But overall we enjoyed it. My ginger margarita was very good."}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time, it's one of our favorite local Mexican restaurants. I've personally never had a bad meal (the fajitas de la casa are my go-to) and the margaritas never disappoint. Be careful not to fill up on the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"We had a really good experience at El Palenque.  The moment we came through the door multiple people were asking if they could help us.  The place was not standing room only, but there were a lot of tables full.  Yet, the wait staff treated us like we were one of the \"few\" people there.  Chips magically appeared, and reappeared, any time we got low.  When it came time to order, every question was answered promptly and with a smile.  The beverage selection was as nice as the food selection throughout the menu.  And then the food came out.  NICE portion sizes.  the plates were not overflowing, but to be completely honest, there wasn't much space left on the plate.  Everything was good.  Four different sets of very satisfied taste buds.  The noise level was very nice.  Even though there is a lot of open space in the restaurant, everyone at the table was able to enjoy easy conversation.  El Palenque is on its way to being a must on the list of places to eat when in East Lake, or even near East Lake.  Go.  Enjoy.  Your Welcome."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, with great Happy Hour  drink deals :) Best had a shredded beef fajita a la cart added on to his chimichanga lunch.  The fajita's beef was stewed to savory perfection. I am definitely ordering that next time with rice.   I had a shrimp diabla plate which was generous in amount, spicy and flavorful as well... But as I mentioned, the pulled beef is highly recommended. If you are familiar with and enjoy a dish called Ropa Vieja it is that, in every way, on the money. I think anything that has this stewed beef on the plate is a winner. Taste buds are still tingling just thinking about it.  Guests are warmly welcomed with tortilla chips and salsa.  Tortilla chips just a touch too thick for my preference, but still good and fresh. The salsa was mild and standard.   Service is very friendly and relaxed. They gave us plenty of time between bites to enjoy, while checking in on our experience periodically.  This Mexican restaurant gets a half star extra, winning over Neighborhood Coco's Locos. (It's that savory beef... I tell you.) Coco's does, however, had a better chips and salsa and is a bit cheaper overall for lunch prices. That said, I will always pay extra dollars for crave-worthiness. And that beef.  I will have to visit both places again and try more of the menu :) Happy we stopped in today to quell my hangry-ness.   Pair your meal with a Modelos on draft, amigo. De nada!  Experience was an overall 3.5 stars. Better than average, pretty good! But that beef today, mijo. Four stars."}
{"text":"The salsa they brought out was very mild to me but if you ask them for something hotter as with most decent Mexican places they did have a hotter version which was more to my liking. The queso dip was very good. I ordered the carnitas plate and everything was cooked right and had the right flavors. I will definitely return as options are very limited in my new surroundings."}
{"text":"Excellent food AND excellent service! We come here at least once a week! Our favorite Mexican restaurant around!"}
{"text":"Food is always very tasty here.  Love the rice and beans!  Staff is very attentive and available.  Decor is nice and everything seems very clean.  It is close to my place of employment so I'm glad it is a quality place.  Would recommend visiting here."}
{"text":"We've been back again and again. After the closing of the Mentor Luchita's, it's great to have an excellent Mexican restaurant in the area again.  The choices are less adventurous than Luchita's was, more Tex-Mex than regional Mexican. But everything tastes fresh and has bold flavors. Even the salsa is fantastic. (Jalapeno Loco was my favorite local salsa before, but Palenque's tops it.)"}
{"text":"This was our choice for dinner tonight. The food is ridiculously good and huge portions. Bar service wasn't the best, they just opened 5 months ago. But the price and good food paid off. I had the Carne Asada meal $12 and my husband had the chicken & steak meal #44 $10 special. We will be back, don't hesitate just order a meal. Another guy at the bar had a taco salad and it was massive, order that if your starving!!! I'm also uploading pictures..."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good discovery that is close to where I live. I love Mexican food, but have never thought of Eastlake as a place to find authentic Hispanic fare until recently when my daughter and I decided to give it a try and were not disappointed.  This place is a pretty good size and it was very busy, so it was a bit on the noisy side. We were seated by an adult birthday party of about 10 very loud women, which became annoying fast.  As soon as we sat down we were served a large basket of chips with some very tasty, fresh salsa. Not that big of a deal, but I was happy to find that the chips were hearty and not salty at all. The salsa had a little heat that caught up with you afterwards.  I ordered enchiladas with black beans and my daughter ordered the quesadilla and burrito combo. Our food arrived within 15 minutes, which impressed us, considering how busy they were that evening. Our food was hot, plentiful, and plated nicely--I had never seen Mexican food presented so nicely before, especially my daughter's plate, which looked almost like it was arranged by someone with OCD.  There are only two things that I didn't care for that evening, and they were direct consequences of a very busy establishment: parking was tough to find and it was noisy. The party of 10 loud women didn't help that at all, but people genuinely seemed to be having a good time and that's what everyone looks for in their dining experience."}
{"text":"Grrat margaritas!! This place has really stepped it up since they first opened. We went tonight after going the first month they opened and it was nice to see that they had upped their game. I had the combination fajitas of chicken steak and shrimp. I asked for no peppers and double onions well done and although the onions weren't well done there were no Peppers. :-) The margaritas are outstanding. My son is a picky eater too and he was also  happy with his fajitas. Nothing super extraordinary about here but the food is good and the Margaritas are great and the service is super quick. We will be back! Did i mention  their margaritas are really good?"}
{"text":"I will not go back. At the end of the meal i explained to the manager at first my food was wrong then my taco had a whole bay leaf inside it i almost choked on..he said they cook with them so i said i understand but they are not supposed to be served whole to people in there food. He proceeded to argue with me then the cook brought a bowl of soup out and garnished it with a bay leaf and said \"see\" i was done talking bay leaves are not really edible they wont harm you but youll have a hell of a time trying to eat one... so i will never go back since thats what they offer and think thats ok to serve to people"}
{"text":"Finally! A decent Mexican restaurant in northeast Ohio. All I want from a Mexican meal: a large margarita, chips and salsa and a good entree that can be scooped up into tortillas. The service is friendly, the food comes out quick. Nothing to complain about. We'll be back.   P.S. When they say \"spicy,\" they actually mean it. Anything with \"diablo\" in the title won't disappoint. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Veggie fajitas great, and enough for two.  Very warm inside- needed to turn air conditioning on.  Will go back."}
{"text":"El Palenque is a nice little place. I am actually not a huge fan of this type of place! (I prefer a little taco like al pastor with just a couple corn tortillas with some pork, onions and cilantro from a mexican grocery or something.) The types of places like El P seem to be sorta similar all over our area and there are many and I can't tell them apart much, but I recently went to El P and liked it nonetheless.  The staff was very friendly. I had wanted to warn them that I was bringing several people in kinda late (930) on a wednesday. I had tried to send them an email through their website - no response. So I called and made a \"reservation\" of sorts. When we arrived.... no knowledge of any of it. My conscience was clear tho as they are open until 10. My husband and I got a little half margarita pitcher and enjoyed it. The chips were good and I just got an enchilada. My husband was super happy because they had (like previously frozen) jalapeno poppers. which is for some reason his go to at mexican restaurants. The waiter was super duper nice and gracious with us even though it was late.  They also have a cute little patio out back when it is warm and have specials certain days especially mondays (tacos and margarita specials that day methinks)"}
