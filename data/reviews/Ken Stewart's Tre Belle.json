{"text":"Always listen to your server. Always listen to your server, ALWAYS listen to your server - especially when you are in the capable hands of one of Ken's highly trained wait-staff. We broke the rule and regretted it.

The 5-star moments: Bellini cocktail made with real peach puree and real Prosecco, Asparagus wrapped with Parmesan and prosciutto, Watermelon-Cucumber salad with mint and balsamic.

The Good: Great server, very conscientious and accommodating, knew his menu and knew what the kitchen would do (almost anything you request if they have it in the house), attentive to our fellow-diner with mobility impairment. Also good - the service was attentive but not rushed, the Chicken picatta rivals my favorite all time version and the sauce on this one was thickened just a little so it would cling to the pasta. The chicken was flavorful and perfectly cooked.

The Bad: They served a dry gin Gimlet with blue cheese olives instead of lime (eww). The table was in outer Solbovia from where we came in the front door. (They need some low-tops in the first room by the front door.) The server did not offer prices for the menu specials - which upon receiving the bill created a bit of a shock - the $30 entree salad was lovely with it's 5 sea scallops and mound of fancy greens, but it wasn't $30 good, even at a Ken Stewart restaurant.

The Awful: (here is where we broke the rule) The decision was between a pizza and the lasagna for one of our party. After much discussion and consultation with the waiter the lasagna was chosen. BAD DECISION. It was not \"Bolognese\" as there was not enough cream in the sauce to even begin to color it and WHERE was the meat???!!! The large serving of undercooked layers of pasta and scant fillings was covered with what I would call Marinara at best and pureed tomatoes at worst. Do NOT order the lasagna. To be fair - they offered to take it off the bill for us and the waiter did remind us that he had \"tried to steer us away from it\" and toward the pizza without ever coming out and saying - \"you won't like it\". We laughingly had to admit he did in fact try to save us from ourselves.

The Unforgivable: As I mentioned earlier, one of our diners that evening is mobility impaired. She had carefully descended to the dining room down a set of 5 rather steep steps, but to go to the restroom she decided to take \"the ramp\" (a long switchback of ADA required wheelchair access). \"The Ramp\" winds its way through the back areas of the restaurant and our diner saw things on her journey she should never have seen: carts and tubs of dirty dishes and table cleanings lined the entire ramp making it impossible to use the hand rails (required for someone in our amica's situation), the floor of the ramp was littered with lettuce shards and a slice of lemon. The topper of the entire trek was to be assaulted from above by someone throwing something over the upper railing down into one of the bins of garbage below. Fortunately, for all involved, the detritus missed our guest, but did land on the floor near her feet.

To be fair, as we were leaving Ken was coming in. He listened attentively to our \"teachable moment\" about the ramp situation and was clearly not pleased. He dashed off to have a look himself and I am sure we will not see this particular issue again. We neglected to fully disclose the lasagna problem but will let him know via phone.

The bottom line: as with many owner-named restaurants, if the owner is on-site the place is amazing. This is true of all of Ken Stewart's establishments. Since he can't be at all three at once, he needs to rely on the most exacting mangers to be his 2nd in his stead. Tre Belle failed this test. I will try them again for lunch or maybe check out the \"rustic brunch\" on Sunday. I would certainly go back for Bellinis and appetizers. Not so much on the special birthday/anniversary dinner occasions. And next time I will listen to my server."}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed. The place is beautiful and the staff is friendly and fast. Just like kens other restaurants.  Although sometimes when the bread come out and it's not omg this is heavenly!! I get a little scared. The bread wasnt warm and I could have  gotten it at giant eagle. I ordered the turkey meatballs and whole wheat pasta.. The pasta was great.. Homemade.. I just didn't care for  the meatballs. There wasn't any flavor and they were dry.. The pasta sauce was good...and everyones elses dinner was just \"ok\"  nothin great..  I think we all just expected wonderful food from kens restaurant... I think we will  be back for brunch only"}
{"text":"The Chilean miners were served quicker. It took 35 minutes to get a glass of wine. That was after they figured out the wine we ordered was out (20 min) and went on to notice they had no clean wine glasses. After watching other tables get served and receive bread - managed to beg for some.  Had to prompt the waiter to allow us to order appetizers which he managed to accurately record. Ordered dinner only to find out the special offered was gone. That took 10 minutes. 

The food was ok, pizza very good. 

Based on the service - will never go back. Too bad -  we were excited for a real Italian restaurant near our home."}
{"text":"Have been there several times now. The pizzas are great. A bit pricey, but if you have the coupon for the salad, pizza, and wine, it makes it a nice evening out."}
{"text":"This was a very mixed experience and I kind of struggle with that 3 star rating as it could have easily been a 2 or a 4 depending on what your priorities are. First off they were SLOW! We had a 6:00 reservation and did not leave the restaurant till 8:40 and we were about the only people there. Appetizers were all very good. The calamari was perhaps the best I've ever had! For dinner I had the branzini (salt crusted bass) which was one of the specials. It was offered as either a filet or the whole fish, I opted for the filet. That is where things went south. The flavor was amazing, however the 45 plus minute wait time with basically no attention from the wait staff (they didn't even ask if we wanted another bottle of wine), coupled with the bones in every bite was too much. I would have been ok with a couple of bones but ever bite, one bite having 5 bones, someone in the kitchen messed up. I will say the server and management handled this superbly. They apologized profusely, offered me something else and comped my meal. Based on that alone I will give this place another chance. I will keep my fingers crossed that the kitchen is faster and the waitstaff more attentive."}
{"text":"When I write a review on someplace that I have only eaten once, I may be off-base or just hit an anomaly, good or bad.  But my wife and I eat at Tre Belle routinely and frequently, so I feel that I can comment with certainty.

Tre Belle is simply an outstanding dining experience with consistently excellent food and superb service. The ambiance is great, whether we dine at the bar, a more private table, or enjoy our dinner at a table on the patio by the fire pit. The specials change often enough to keep the menu fresh and interesting. And lastly, if you are a fan of thin crust, wood-fired oven pizza, you have found heaven in Richfield/Bath."}
{"text":"Difficult to make a reservation, false advertise their hours. Even though they advertise that their kitchen is open until 10, the hostess refused to take my reservation at 9. She wouldn't even take one any later than 8. It seems like all they care about is getting out of work early, must not need the business. Made a reservation at Burntwood in the Falls at 9:30 instead."}
{"text":"yea i'm a fan
this is another restaurant by ken stewart's and i am a regular at the grill and lodge
went there last week
the antipasto choices are great
the room a little loud and crowded
the drinks big
the wine list italian and extensive
you have to remember the place has only been open a couple of weeks and is still evolving
the pasta was served hot but lacked a little flavor 
i had the hot sausage dish
wifie had the lamb ragout which was better
the cold italian meats where wonderful
my cannoli was average
but the tiramisu was very good 
no pasta with the meat dishes, but i was told that that was being addressed on the new menu
Try It !"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Tre Belle on a Tuesday evening after intending to for several years, and I don't know why we waited so long. The decor is homey and warmly Tuscan, yet modern and clean. The food is wonderful, innovative Italian with great service. Although we didn't try it this time, the antipasto bar looked like a lot of fun and definitely worth a try. Server Dave was perfectly punctual and the rhythm of our dining experience was spot on from drinks to dessert...no waits, nothing too early. We thoroughly enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad and the handmade pizza topped with pancetta, Kalamata olives, goat cheese, artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers. It was rich and wonderful...and the crust was thin, light and airy. Really spectacular pizza. Dessert was zeppoli with Apple topping and very fresh whipped cream. Rich, dense and sweet, these were a great end to the meal. In all, a really great experience. The pricing was fair, expect to pay more than you would at a theme restaurant and know that it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The decadent scent hits you in the parking lot and draws you in! The best wait staff anywhere makes the dining experience both elegant and relaxed. Everything is amazing - by I always get scallops. Last night they didn't have any so my wonderful waiter went to the Lodge and brought me back an unforgettable dinner. Great wine cellar as well. 

I prefer sitting in a booth near the bar - I have to say my table in the red room was too near the kitchen and too loud."}
{"text":"Sorry, I accidentally tagged tres belle instead of ken Stewart's lodge (they are connected). Tres belle is actually pretty good, but the previous review is for the lodge, and it fit that description."}
{"text":"We went last weekend for my grandmother's 87th birthday. Like Ken Stewart's other restaurants, the servers are very attentive, friendly and don't rush you through the meal. 

The meal was delicious. I had a house salad with their delicious white French dressing and the chicken parmesan. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. They definitely don't skimp on the size either!

Our group also shared an order of mussels which were very tasty. I've had their pizzas in the past during their happy hour and you can't go wrong with those either."}
{"text":"As others have said, the water here is so weird. If they can't figure out the water situation they should at least be providing bottled water or some sort of filtered option! 

We split a pizza which was okay at best, but greasy and really salty. My 'kale quinoa salad' was literally just a mound of kale with maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of quinoa sprinkled on top, with a few cranberries and very little dressing. The prices were high for what was served to us as well.

If you're looking for a similar restaurant with much better food, Three Palms in Hudson absolutely blows this place out of the water."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Tre Belle. It is a fairly popular place as finding parking is really difficult. Once inside it is very loud and hard to have a conversation without uncomfortably raising your voice. My dinning partner had pasta with chicken I had the chicken Milanese. She had a glass of house wine and I had a glass of bourbon.  The food was fairly average, on par with the chain Italian restaurants. However the price was not on par, our bill before tip was almost $100. You saw what we got above. Not that the food was bad, it was just way over priced as are the drinks. I guess you're paying for the Ken Stewart's name. Our waitress was really good. She was attentive and friendly. I would not recommend this establishment based on cost, parking & noise."}
{"text":"First let me list the positives.  The restaurant has a terrific atmosphere and is decorated beautifully.  Our server was great and the dessert was excellent.  Now for the negatives... my food was mediocre at best (I ordered from the antipasto bar) and the prices were expensive for what you got.  However, my friends said that they liked their food.  I probably will not go back here but would be interested in trying the Lodge."}
{"text":"Y'know how it is, when you haul those leftover meatballs from the freezer, type in 2:22 on the old microwave, stand there watching the carousel?  *ding*  Cut into that big ol ball o' meat and... and... uh-oh.  Still cold on the inside!

Yeah, that shouldn't happen at ANY restaurant.  For ANY price.  

Happened.  Last night.  At Tre Belle.

I can count on one hand the number of times I've refused food.  (Yeah, I'm counting jail, wise guy.)  I refused the waitress' suggestion they \"heat it up.\"  Why?  Let's see:  Because I ordered it heated up?  Unless it was preparted al dente?  Or perhaps \"Meatball Tartare?\"  Or like eggs, \"over easy?\"

\"The little man walked up and down
To find an eating place in town.
He read the menu, through and through
To see what fifteen bucks would do.

\"One (semi-thawed inedible) meatball.\"

-- Josh White, adjusted for inflation"}
{"text":"We just got take out at this restaurant and it was a very poor experience. Whenever we have,it is not  ready when they say. Rarely a complete order, and this time,we had to check, and if we didn't 25% of our meal would not have been there when we got home. The worst, and in my opinion the most egregious, is we asked that there be NO walnuts on the Dessert pizza, as our friend's daughter is highly allergic to them. We looked and it had walnuts on it. We showed the manager, as well as the person making pizzas,and he said \"no, those are the nuts in the Nutella.\" I said to look at what's on top of the bananas and he said I was right,it has walnuts. So they made us a new one and it wasn't cooked all the way, it was too doughy. Needless to say we didn't eat it. In a word shame!  Word to the wise......check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Excellent.  High quality ingredients, expertly prepared.  I've noticed other reviews knock the service here, but ours was faultless.  This is not a little spaghetti & pizza joint; Tre Belle would thrive in any hip, big-city market.  Solid wine list, although not too many Italian reds in the \"by the glass\" section.  No kids menu, but they're good about working with a narrow appetite.  Best calamari I've had in a long time.  Awesome wood-fired pizza.  Delicious tiramisu.  Go.  Now."}
{"text":"Last night some friends and I dined at this establishment, it has been one of our favorite places...until last night. After waiting almost 40 minutes for our credit cards to be returned so we could sign our checks and leave we were informed that their credit card machine was down. We asked our very kind waiter, Spencer, what the eta would be. He then returned with all of our credit card information written on a card for us to sign. After explaining that we were not comfortable with this, the very unpleasant manager, Wendy came to our table. She explained that this is what all of their restaurants do when the credit card machine is down with no apology for the inconvenience whatsoever. When we explained that we were not comfortable with leaving our credit card details with her unsecured and overnight and shared that this practice is unsafe her response was, \"well how are you going to pay for your food?\" 
Unbelievable. HORRIBLE way to treat a frequent customer or any customer in general. I recommend that Wendy go through some basic customer service training as she should not be in a position to deal with customers. Additionally, I suggest Ken's work on understanding privacy laws. I won't be returning to this establishment who puts their customers LAST."}
{"text":"I had a friend from Venice with me and so I thought we'd try Tre Belle when needed to say the salad that came with the dinner was the most disappointing I ever had Iceberg and the most Bland dressing and more Iceberg on a plate worst salad ever I passed it was okay although my friend from Italy said their pastas basically is a very inexpensive pasta and he should know I would hope that the dinner salad should improve the hostess asked me how was my dinner and I told her about the salad she said well what do you expect it comes with the dinner I said you have your name on it do better"}
{"text":"Not knowing who Ken Stewart is or what his restaurants are about, I ignorantly went into this restaurant with zero expectations. My mom suggested it as a place that she loves and since I am in town, thought I should stop in.

Started off with some wine and beer, nothing to go crazy over - just a nice selection of both at manageable prices.

For an appetizer got the asparagus wrapped in cheese and prosciutto. What else do I need to say, it was amazing, and a nice precursor for things to come.

Dinners, my mom got the Italian nachos, something I have never seen on a menu before nor even thought of. Instantly impressed, I tried some since the plate was made for maybe 3 guys or 4-6 ladies dependent on who's cautious about weight. They were covered in Italian classic toppings like banana peppers and capicola. (I can't remember what else is on them but it's a nice concoction.)

I ended up getting a calzone with roasted peppers, capicola, and goat cheese. The crust of the calzone was really good, tasted brick oven baked. Delicious.

Service was great...can you be too nice?

Decor was classy, but not too fancy for my style.

We sat outside when it was 55 degrees out, next to the fire, and was very pleasant. Really cool patio, would be a nice place to hang out for a bit.

Being in a region where good Italian food is easy to come by (trust me, in SLC, Utah we have little choice) this place stacks right up there as a must go. For me, I'd go back again for sure, as there were many other things on the menu that I'd be interested in trying and I wouldn't be afraid to bring someone new here."}
{"text":"The Tuscany food is very fresh and flavorful. If you go on a week night get the pasta bowl for the table you will not be disappointed. It is very expensive but worth the price."}
{"text":"I would say the salmon meal is fantastic and perfectly cooked medium rare every time. Wife was out of town and ate here every night. Super consistent. I have not had a bad experience here at all. Super friendly staff. Great service"}
{"text":"The Italian Nachos were amazing and great portion size. Loved the atmosphere and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot as a family. Sometimes it is great and other times really just blah. Food is hit or miss and service is too. I feel as if all the female staff is amazing but the couple times we have had male servers I question why the place would hire introverts who aren't proactive. Recommend pizzas and fish. Love the Italian nachos. However cheese bowl pasta is too cheesy and the meats can be over or undercooked. Think it's unique to area though."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at one of the Ken Stewart establishments and I really wanted to like it, but it fell way short.

There were a few good things, though:
First: our waiter was great. Attentive, good explanations when asked - well done.

Second: The iced tea was delicious.

Third: The calamari appetizer was quite good with colorful peppers and a light breading.

The bad: 
Strike 1:My wife, our 6 year old and I were sat in a table in the corner of the bar in a restaurant that was not crowded. Poor seating and an atmosphere we weren't looking - or paying - for.

Strike 2: The sauce. I really can't say much good about it. It was too sweet and garlic-packed (and I love garlic).

Strike 3: My veal parm. The veal was about 1/8\" thick with 3/4\" of crunchy breading that's strongest flavor seemed to be rosemary. At first glance, the veal seemed to have no red-sauce at all, instead a dollop of pesto in the center of the cheese. After picking around a bit, though, I found that sweet garlic sauce piled in the middle. It just didn't taste good. At all.

If we wanted to sit near the restrooms and enjoy only appetizers - unlikely - we may return. Otherwise, I cannot see this being on our list."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on Saturday night for date night. Made a reservation for 8. Got there expecting it to be packed and it was very empty so no reservation was necessary. That seemed odd but not worrisome.

Sat near the bar and was served promptly. Ordered a $10 drink (they're all $8-10) and proceeded to watch the bartender look at the drink menu to see what was in the drink before making. It tasted okay but for a place like this and the price of the drinks I expect a qualified bartender who knows how to make one of their 'signature' drinks. Apparently not signature enough...

Wife ordered Chicken piccata and I ordered Shrimp Fra Diavolo. Both were tasty and hot but nothing spectacular. Size was moderate (not huge, not small). Although my Fra Diavolo only had 5 medium sized shrimp which wasn't a lot in the bowl of pasta. 

Also had to ask for some bread to gnaw on prior to meals arriving which I thought was odd as most places offer this without hesitation. Bread was a relative bland garlic buttered with no olive oil or dip to use. 

Finished with creme brulee which was excellent.

Service was the best part of the night as our server was knowledgeable, attentive and very friendly. Other than looking like he was 15, he did a great job :)

Overall, the place is pricey for okay-to-good food. Like most higher end places, drinks are ridiculously priced and again, I expect a bartender to know how to make drinks without looking at a menu to figure it out.

Not sure I'd make it a 'must visit' place but it was good."}
{"text":"As expected, the food was outstanding. We sampled virtually the entire menu. The Sausage Stuffed Peppers from the Appetizer list are a must. They are fresh, they are good and they pack a punch. 
The plates from the dinner menu are outstanding as well. From the Veal to the Strip to the Alfredo...very very good. Also, probably the best Tiramisu I have ever had. 
The service was friendly and timely. 
The Atmosphere was a bit lacking. It has a bit of an \"Olive Garden\" feel to it. This is weird when you consider the menu and the numbers to the right of the items on it. 
Would recommend to anybody and would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Tre Belle (pronounced 'bell-?', rhymes with 'today') is a nice little place in Bath Township to get a freshly made Italian meal. The menu is much smaller than its sister Ken Stewart's restaurants, and there are usually only a few nightly specials. The prices are probably a little bit more expensive than they need to be, but still in line with a Ken Stewart's restaurant. The Italian Nachos are very filling (and very large) and make for a good appetizer for the table. I had the Bastardo pizza and it was super fresh and flavorful - - definitely felt like a well thought out pizza pie built around fresh ingredients. The bar is small but cozy, and on weekends both the bar and adjacent dining room get lively. In the summer time outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but I really can not say the same about the food. I saw an employee open a bag of pre cooked sausage to use on a pizza. Some items are really good and others are mediocre. My biggest complaint is the water. A restaurant like this should have filtered water at the very least. The horrible salty taste of the water carries over to the iced tea and the coffee. To me if the water tastes bad everything made or cooked with it will reflect the poor quality."}
{"text":"For some reason a review I wrote last week ended up filtered.  I did not think that was fair to the restaurant and decided to write another. 

My wife and I visited Tre Bella the first time last Saturday. Did we like it? We're going back tomorrow. This is a real gem that serves not only great food but does it in a beautiful, modern atmosphere that would be at home in NYC, SFO, CHI, wherever.  Although we love them, too, this is not an old-fashioned meatballs and spaghetti Italian restaurant. This is old-world quality with new world creativity. Simply amazing. If Yelp would like to contact me to assure I am just a regular customer and not involved with the restaurant in ANY way, I sincerely wish they would. 

Try this place as it's just amazing. (Sit at the antipasto bar, it's very cool!.)"}
{"text":"Tre Belle is one of the best places to enjoy a beautiful dinner in the summer!  The patio is beautiful, with flower boxes, a fountain, and a fire pit.  There is even a bocci court outside, which I love, and can't seem to find a bocci court anywhere.  The appetizer selection is perhaps a bit sort, but we had the mussels and they were just right.  The prince Edward island mussels came in a spicy red sauce and with a few crostinis- and I swear I could've licked the bowl clean - the sauce was so nice.  Just a bit messy.  For entrees, I had the Chicken Piccata and my fiance had the Pork Marsala special.  I really thought my dish was well cooked, the piccata sauce was creamy and well balanced and the portion of chicken was spot on.  My fiance really enjoyed the pork chop- it was cooked very nicely - but didn't care too much for the polenta cake.  The wine list featured a nice mix of domestic as well as Italian wines, but was a tad bit pricy.  The only complaint I have was the dessert selection was minimal.  The tirimisu was good- but I would like to see a chocolate cake.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.  We were greeted at the door with a smile, and thanked for coming in when we left.  Our server was a very polite, knowledgable guy and made sure we got everything in a timely fashion.  We willo be back soon - especially during happy hour for some half price pizza!"}
{"text":"After one visit, this place became my favorite restaurant. I went there this summer and had some antipasto which was the perfect tuneup for the main event which is the pizza. It's super thin crust but not crispy. The toppings are sparse and super fresh. The cheese is fresh mozzarella- not too much. It is authentic, amazing Italian pizza. It is totally different from regular pizza parlor pizza (which I love) and it is worth the hefty price. Once you try it you'll understand. A glass of red wine and any one of their pizzas and you're good.

Another interesting thing they do there that makes it great for a date is that they offer some sort of unusual item that's not on the menu that they make for you right at your table. One time it was a dessert that featured black pepper. Such a weird idea you have to try it. Another time it was some kind of Italian dessert cheese cut into a delicate 'flower' at your table and drizzled with honey. Both excellent and memorable. It changes from day to day.

The people who work there take their job seriously and do Ken Stewart proud. You know you're in a nice place.  At the other Ken Stewart locations you get so much food you don't need to eat for a week (which is good because you couldn't afford it anyway) but at Tre Bella, it's just right. A plate of antipasto, split a pizza and a bottle of wine and you can still walk when dinner is done.

Great place. Ken Stewart's best."}
{"text":"The service was PERFECT!  The wine selections are plentiful.  The food is creative and delicious, but there is some room for improvement.  
Appetizer: Bruschetta- it was a little unusual, the tomatoes are almost stewed rather than fresh.  it also needed a little more salt and the bread should have been toasted.
Fried Calamari- lightly breaded and delicious, maybe on the tiny side, but still very well prepared and flavorful

Entree--   The parmigiano-reggiano pasta prepared table side and flambéed inside a HUGE wheel of cheese.  it was also served with a side of seared scollops.  I know the cheese is very very full of flavor and a heavy dish, totally expected.  HOWEVER, the type of noodles that were used should have been more like fettuccine or another thicker/flatter pasta.  The noodles were slightly over cooked and had too much cheese.  Scallops PERFECTLY cooked and seasoned.

Dessert-- chocolate mousse --- OH YEAH, so awesome!"}
{"text":"6:30 reservation, still haven't been served by 7:45. Ordered beer , serve staff forgot so I cancelled beverage at 7:10. We requested our three entrees boxed \"to go\" -wait was uncomfortable. One entree terribly over salted. We were comped the appetizers already ordered. Apologetic manager. Very disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"The setting and environment are fantastic. The food was fresh and delicious. I have never experienced such great service. Absolutely try the pizza and the pasta wheel was entertaining and delicious. I will return anytime I am in the area."}
