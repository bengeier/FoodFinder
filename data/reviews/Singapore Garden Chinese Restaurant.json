{"text":"Ideal food when your definition of multi course meals means eating many times in a party all through the night. A sought after favorite with my group of desi friends. The only issue with them is that they give you a king's treatment  when you order a big amount on a busy night - have waited for more than 1 hour but the food is worth the wait.

Try the beef and chilly chicken."}
{"text":"I just have to clear a few things up about this restaurant. I do have to vouch for them a bit because I worked there for some time many many years ago.

The food is, like most places, Westernized Chinese/Indian food. It's hard to find a place that serves super traditional Chinese food at all these days. Hakka is a Chinese-Indian style of cooking. The owners ARE Chinese and do speak Chinese but they were born in Calcutta, therefore they speak Urdu, Hindi, Mandarin and Hakka to say the least. 

Their menu is very diverse with a generous selection of veggie dishes as well to suit their clientele. Most of their customers I find do hear about this place through word of mouth. 

Their service may not be top notch and from time to time the wait gets a bit lengthy but I don't hear as many complaints about the food quality than the wait for the food. I've always found that their portions are generous, prices are reasonable.  

But I will have to say this: I still crave their chili chicken and Manchurian soup!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on the West end of the GTA... maybe once every couple of months, I make it a point to go to Singapore Garden. It's not hard to spot if you're looking out for it, although yes, it is on the side of some old motel.

Their service is friendly enough, but the food is excellent. They know how to do Hakka cuisine (and I know what I'm eating), and they do it well.

I especially love their banana dessert, which is hot banana with a hard outer candy shell. Mmmm... hits the spot after a big meal."}
{"text":"This was probably 2.5/5...

The food here is good. Just good - nothing exceptional. It's typical of any other Hakka Chinese restaurants. Family style dining with big portions and good value. And the staff were really friendly.

If you are looking for a relaxed dining experience, this is not the place. The decor is quite outdated and kinda dingy. I noticed quite a few people picking up their take out, and I can understand why. The food was okay - I didn't love it, but my Dad and brother enjoyed it. 

It's a little out of my way, so I am not sure if I'll go there again. But I wouldn't be opposed to ordering take out."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be our favourite years ago when this was probably amongst the first Hakka restaurant in the west of T.O. Nothing has changed inside perhaps a fresh coat of paint and that's it. The chairs and tables perhaps updated in the last 15 years or so but were of the same kind. 

Ordered a large Vegetarian Hot and Sour soup - fairly good, had tons of shredded carrots and has canned mushrooms. 
A Paneer Chilly-fresh paneer coated deep fried in a bit of gravy and hit the right notes. 
A Vegetarian Manchurian pakora style-nice smaller pieces of pakoras and in Manchurian sauce. A good dish. 
A vegetable fried rice-was plain and nothing special, not bad either
A Vegetarian Manchurian Chow Mein which fairly good. 

The service was fine and we were told as soon as we started ordering the kitchen was busy and may take time for the food. The soup was out sooner. The food did take a bit longer, but it wasn't bad. 

Also, even though I forgot to mention less oil for fried rice and dishes, all dishes were made with not excessive oil, which we all preferred. We were 6 of us today and bill was just over $60 with taxes and tips. 
Competitively priced, I would say."}
{"text":"This place has really good food !!! recommended for everyone, been going here for 5 years and never once had a problem or bad service, they treat customers with respect which is very important in the restaurant business!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for hakkah Chinese food! I always get the Manchurian chicken with gravy and they always make it with the perfect spice, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good sized place. Pretty big menu. Reasonably priced. They have some Indian items too. Only one issue I have is their chicken meat is a bit stinky. But otherwise, nice place. Oh no beef on menu."}
{"text":"First time at Singapore Garden and let me tell you................mmmm gooood! Will be going back very soon. It has eat in but I think taking it to go is better because the location is not the greatest. Overall, great spicy food and at a good price. Go check it out and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Soup tasted like bath water. And the rest tasted old and stale.  Veg rolls wee wrapped in some king of doughy wrapper and no filling!!!Drive all the way there only to be told they don't take MasterCard!  Then had to drive around area looking for bank."}
{"text":"I really don't know why people are going on about wait times. It's only busy at Saturday and Sunday nights. But that's true of most restaurants on weekend nights. There's also a reason why it's busy, because people come there for the food. The owners know what this restaurant is and haven't made the mistake of glitzing it up or try to make it something it's not. It's Hakka Chinese food, not a posh, dimly lit, lounge music playing restaurant. I go there for the food and I have a very good time talking to the owner and sever when I go there. It's not possible to do this on a Saturday or Sunday night but try to get to know them. It'll show you appreciate their work and more importantly the food!"}
{"text":"I would say roughly nine months ago, I was fortunate to work with two co-op students who love food. One of them lives in Brampton and suggested visiting Singapore Garden. Her favourite dish was and probably still is the crispy beef.

I never forgot her suggestion. In fact, all three of us ended up swapping our favourite restaurants in various cities, along with our favourite nail salons.

A few months ago, I decided to do a staycation, complete with booking a hotel for the weekend in Brampton. On my way over to the hotel, I decided to stop here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.

There is parking off to the side of the restaurant, but it is limited. Instead, I parked behind the restaurant and walked in.

I was promptly seated. I was the only one eating in there at 3 pm. Yes, I tend to eat lunch late.

I ordered the chilli chicken with rice. You get a lot of food and rice. There were plenty of chopped green chilies and onions. You could combust if someone were to light a match close to you, I reckon.

I also ordered the crab mushroom soup. It was good. I am not a fan of egg that is dropped and cooked in the soup, so that was the only downer. I still ate the soup, but weeded out the egg. 

The food was amazing. The server is your typical Chinese woman who wants to know where you are from heritage-wise if you are Chinese, where you work, what you do, whether you are married, and more. Yep, the fairly curious type that borders nosy, but is nice. I learned that her boyfriend lives in Markham, too.

There were plenty of takeout orders. The phone rang often. Folks dropped in and out as I continued eating. If I am ever in the area again, I may do the same and pick up food to go.

There is one gigantic fish in the tank at the restaurant. I figured out that the fish is a she. She had a boo-boo when she swam into the side of the tank and hurt her mouth, but seemed to be in good spirits.
