{"text":"Sopressata  has  great food, not the most exciting decore. Ive had their food dine in , take out and their catering. The panini are great , good sized sandwich ample portions. Good bang for your buck. The pasta is typical pasta with a good sauce. 

They have good catering . They help you put a good menu together for your event. Used their food for several family events and everyone has enjoyed. They also deliver  which is a bonus.

I would defiantly recommend you give them a try , either for the hot table or a good panini worth the visit."}

{"text":"Can Maple, Ontario handle another Panini eatery?
I have Paninis coming outta my pores, red from Tomato sauces.
Traditional Italian cuisine with a Modern taste.
Interesting idea but my palate has difficulty tasting the Modern so far.
Differentiation compared to peers in the neighbourhood?  Unknown.

Interior design has a sleek MODERN Red & White contrast.

One side of wall is pure mirror'd while I tune to CP24 & Z103.
Visually opposite from the previous Chicago-style Pizza resto.

Paninis($7.00), Pastas, Vegetables, Meats, Fish, Sides.
Toppings($0.50) however didn't apply to me so I'm all smiles.
Must be some Grand Opening freebie. 
Red Hot Chili Peppers & Mushrooms please.
Grazie Mille, Lady."}
