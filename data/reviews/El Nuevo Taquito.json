{"text":"Had the Carne Asada burrito, it was fresh and delicious!! Plus watched novellas and hot women on Univision :) great quick spot for lunch for downtowners that want good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I discovered this spot after searching for a new place for carne asada burritos after witnessing a nose picking incident at my old burrito spot by one of the food preparers..i know gross right. But I'm glad I found this place its closer to home and the food is amazing and carne is always fresh."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, chili Verde was a little on the runny side, but no harm. 
 Very small place, maybe 15 booths and a couple of tables"}
{"text":"Legit, delicious food. 

A few pals and I came here after volunteering at a school nearby. When we drove past in the morning, we knew we'd have to forgo the volunteers' lunch and save room for this. 

I went for cheese enchiladas while my dining companions got various tacos. Their enchilada sauce was super flavorful as was the hot sauce (which I always drench my food with). Didn't love the refried beans but otherwise my meal was on point. 

Bonus for the meat being grilled outside, so you can follow the scent into the restaurant, knowing you're in for a treat. 

Also, the place is nice and bright and clean."}
{"text":"Had to stop at this Food City one time and i saw this whole in the wall mexican taco shop. I saw a few mexicans inside and i always figured if you see people from mexico eating at a mexican place that it must be good. I was totally right, ive had their tacos (carne asada, head and tongue) and had gorditas, which are hand made and really delicious, the sauce selection rocks! the girl taking your order is very friendly, you can order in english or spanish if you prefer. Ive gone there three times already....cannot get enough of their delicious tacos!"}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken tacos with rice and beans.  This place is really clean and the food is g"}
{"text":"Went in on a whim to try their Tacos Al Pastor, and I was not disappointes.Fantastic little hole in the wall place, very clean and very nice staff. Will definitely come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Totally random stop for lunch in some area of town that I had never been before, but it does appear to be in the lower income part of Phoenix. Located in shady strip mall, I chose the random mexican over the random Chinese next door. It turned out to be an excellent decision. The food consumed here was a simple chicken burrito, which was $4.25 plus I added rice for an extra 75 cents. The chicken was cooked nicely, shredded and all white meat (rare for divey Mexican) and packed into a large burrito with the rice, beans (refried), cilantro and onions. A decent salsa bar was also available and the red sauce had a smoky flavor and the green wasn't watery either, but more a guac sauce. Cucumbers, carrots and shredded cabbage also on hand if desired. Some of my best burros in life have come from the worst looking places and areas and El Nuevo Taquito comes through in that respect. Mexican music playing in the background is also always a comforting sign."}
{"text":"This is one of the best place I been to. The food is perfect every time I come, no mistakes, place is clean and the workers are very nice. I recommend to try this place at least once, you will love it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Mexican food that is delivered super-fast, in a clean setting and well priced,  then this place is IT!  I have been there a couple of times, and it was without a doubt, Delish!  The first time I had the Chimichanga, and it was very good, delivered in under 10 minutes.  The next time I had the Carne Asada Torta, and it was so amazing that I ordered a second one... They have it all; fresh limes, tasty Salsa, and the food was to die for.  The Torta was served on a bolillo bread that was gently toasted, had marinated meat, and also some Jalapenos to spice it up.  If you are in the area, don't pass this up.  This is fast- food without it being a fast food restaurant. Yummy..."}
{"text":"The food is good. But if you want to try GREAT food you need to head to birrieria Obregon. Anyways, customer service at el Nuevo taquito sucks. when you place your order the lady is RUDE. And hangs up on you. I went to pay and she snatched the debit card. Only thing I don't like, other than that... food isn't so bad!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have street tacos (carne asada and tripas) and carne asada tortas! I have no photos at this time but next time I'll make sure to post. They also have great customer service and will bring the warm plates to you!"}
{"text":"It was alright.  I mean, the portions were generous and the service timely, but nothing special.  The flavor fell flat for me, so I can't say I'll be returning, but I don't feel like it was a waste of money."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places! Excellent food! Very nice staff! I always get the taquitos combo and cheese quesadilla it's amazing! We go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I have dreamt about the chilaquiles for a year now. This clean, casual spot is within walking distance from my friends house where I spent a couple of days last summer.  I walked in one day just because it is close and I love local Mexican joints. The ambiance was pleasantly surprising and it is nicer inside than I had expected.  The food is classic taqueria fare with tortas, tacos, enchiladas and my beloved chilaquiles. After several very good meals here I have thought about it for the past year while I was on the east coast.  Now I am back and it is as good as I remember. 

Meals tend to run between $6 & $8 and there are lots of Mexican sodas to choose from for $2 or less. The salsa and condiment bar has also been pretty consistent except there are only a few choices."}
{"text":"I drove by and decided to stop. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and it blew my mind! It's by far the best I had ever had. The meat had such good flavors and seasoned perfectly. The salsa bar had great sauces. My personal favorite was the salsa verde and the red onions that were marinaded in awesomeness! The ONLY thing I didn't like was that I wish the tortilla wasn't as soggy, it almost fell apart on me. Other than that the flavors are perfect."}
{"text":"This place is really clean. The selection menu is good, everything is pretty much cheaper than other places (sopes). They give you nice clean chunks of meat, not ugly greasy fatty pieces. Did I mention this place was super clean, which I'm very big on when it comes to food."}
{"text":"So far all I had is the Tacos! Cant wait to try the rest of the food."}
{"text":"This is one of THE BEST Mexican restaurants out here in Phoenix.  The area isn't too great but do not be fooled.  Good food is Good food.  Their horchata is the traditional horchata that just should be renamed as the drink of the Gods.  Their carne asada burritos are heavenly, and their ceviche never fails me.  Great food and fast service.  So if you're looking for a legit Mexican restaurant to go to, El Nuevo Taquito is the place to go."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I was just there last week! In all honesty, the area is not the best, nor is the actual building. Although, once inside, depending on the time of the day, it usually is fairly clean, and the employees are very nice. I personally do not speak Spanish, but I have been coming for so long that they recognize me. But don't be alarm, most employees speak fairly good English. 

Though the location is questionable, the food is delicious! I LOVE their Carne Asada Burritos and this is the ONLY place I go to get a burrito. There homemade Flour Tortillas are to die for, as I am VERY picky when it comes to Tortillas. I don't go ANYWHERE else for a burrito. They also have very good Tortas too. So, don't let the location make you hesitate, it will be worth it if you LOVE a good burrito. 

The Carne Asada Burrito has Beans, Carne Asada, Pico De  Gallo, and Guacamole. And before I forget, their Red Sauce has a very different taste than something you would get at Phillibertos or any other Mexican Food Restaurant. This Red Sauce goes PERFECTLY with their Carne Asada Burrito."}
{"text":"A solid taco shop tucked in a strip mall. Pastor, lengua, carnitas, carne asada and more plus cocktail camerones, orchata etc.  I've had all of the above and was not disappointed.  Today this was the first place I went when I landed to curb my taco craving!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed by the food, sad to say. I was really looking forward to this place being good but nothing had flavor for me. I order the grilled shrimp, very bland and still had the shell in! I'm mean that's cool and all for the look but when ur fighting with the shell to take out the good part that's a big negative for me. The beans and rice were okay, I tried some of my girlfirends tacos.. I couldn't even tell you what it was cuz the flavor was just nothing exciting for me. Would I come back probably not, would i recommend this place to people i know, most likely not.. Not to post this to steer you away but like I said I wasn't impressed much. The best tasting thing was the fountain drink COKE."}
{"text":"i'd give this place 0 stars if it was an option.  been here 3x, only to give it another chance and try something different each time. but no, I'm sorry but the food tastes so generic, out of a can possibly. 
tacos: Carne was too oily, sopes; watery and sawgy, gordita: fell apart,  had to use fork, the green Chile pork,  omg, the worst ever,  it tasted like it was never finished cooking. your better off going to tacos sahuayo or taqueria yaqui nearby.  I hate to give bad reviews but this place just ain't recommended."}
{"text":"Tacos are great. The beans have a really good taste. The rice tastes homemade. Price is cheap."}
{"text":"DELISH tacos and everything looks freshly home made. Busy little place filled with workin' men waiting for Big bags of food to go and families with wee little ones out for lunch.  The sign says Tacos Mi Ranchito. GOOD spot for a quick stop!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for the last 10 years. Once again I am working in the downtown area and there are quite a few Mexican restaurants near me but I will always drive down to South Phoenix to grab food from here. In 10 years the food has not changed. It is the same great Carne Asada Taco's and Burrito's I have enjoyed over and over.

While living in Texas I would come back to Phoenix to visit and this was always on the list of places I had to go. Breakfast Lunch or Dinner this restaurant can serve up some of the best food in town."}
{"text":"One of the better places in south Phoenix. Been going here ever since it was even in a building. The tacos taste great. The burritos are top notch.  Is it the best Mexican food in Phoenix ? I don't think so.. but for the prices they are!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum !! If you're looking for a fast food Mexican place to eat real authentic Mexican food look no further they have the best selection various Foods they also do catering free events excellent food!!"}
{"text":"this place is so good and flavorful.. my favorite  the rajas and queso gordita..  must try.."}
{"text":"Super clean, reasonably priced and friendly. Several families were dining with children.  Everything was freshly made and delicious too."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great value. My carne asada tacos were well prepared and I only wish I ordered more. The flavor was great, with good, well seasoned meat. Don't let the parking lot scare you away, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good food!  Had three street tacos - pastor, carnitas and carne asada. All three good but the pastor was my favorite!"}
{"text":"I've had quite a few plates from this restaurant. It's become \"our spot\" for me and my girlfriend on the weekends. It's a family run restaurant and you get the family welcome and home made food. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"This location is no longer called El Nuevo Taquitos. It has been renamed Tacos Mi Ranchito."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos and salsas. Only reason I'm rating 4 instead of 5 Star is because my pastor burrito was a bit soupy. Mostly retried beans and average pastor in the burrito, no rice, and not much vegetable wise. I had 2 asada tacos which were great, and the horchata was very flavorful. Next time I'll try a burrito with asada or chicken instead!"}
