{"text":"It's a Russian deli store with huge selection of produce you don't find easy in a regular supermarket. They have excellent breads, very tasty cakes and big selection of deli meats. They also have some traditional prepared food. If you love perogies and pelmeni (meat perogies) then you should visit their frozen food section, as they have many types of those. From hand-made to machine-made, the choice is yours. It is a very-well know store in Russian community, but all staff speaks English, so you won't have any problem, for sure."}
{"text":"I am speachless...I had a few items in my basket and put the basket on the counter at the checkout register.  The person at the register didn't touch the basket and asked me to take everything out and put it on the counter in order for him to scan it. I was shocked and asked politely why wouldn't he take it out? So he replied in a very mean voice that it takes too much time and it would be too hard for him to do it for everyone....I was so shocked that I had nothing to answer back to him. I would take my time and go complain to the manager, as how hard is to lift 300 grams of turkey? But guess what..this rude man was actually one of the owners of this very store. How dare is he treating his customers this way?????"}
{"text":"Fantastic pierogi! We picked up some traditional cheese and potato and some delightful sour cherry.  The sweet cheese in the dairy section is a perfect topping for the sour cherry pierogi when mixed with a bit of sour cream.  So many lovely Russian items.  I am partial to the great soup and pickle selections, and the many varieties of tea and bread.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Richmond Hill Deli has a good selection of Russian grocery, cold cut, cheese and the selection of perogies is quite amazing. A freezer with different brand/flavour including Cherry? So perogies as dessert too! They even have their own in house brand.  Selection cannot compare to the bigger European market but the store itself is really clean.   There is a small bakery section but if you want more dessert or even a whole cake, you can visit Richmond Hill Bakery/Cafe just opened 2 month ago a few store down."}
