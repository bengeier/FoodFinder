{"text":"Loved going to this place. Great food and very cheap. Last week when I went I was interrupted by a giant cockroach climbing on the wall. Just before we left, I heard a crunch - the girl behind up stepped on another giant cockroach. The owner didn't seem too concerned and says that they get sprayed but they keep coming back. Was grossed out and had to pay for meal in full - will never return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome when you come home, feel like Thai/Chinese but are too lazy to pick it up, and definitely too lazy to make it. Order in! It gets there really really fast. I am not sure how they do it, but it's fast. A few minutes pass and you're yum yum yumming away on your living room couch. My favourite thing on the menu is the General Tao Chicken. It tastes delicious when it arrives AND it tastes delicious the next morning (if there is any left over, which there sometimes is because I frequently over order from this place). Other recommendations are the green curry chicken or beef, lemongrass chicken or beef, and spicy shanghai noodle. Mmmmm. Guess what I am ordering now?"}
{"text":"I have never been to the dinning room here, but I have ordered delivery at least 20 times, and have tried a lot of different things from the menu.  Their lemon-grass recipe is really terrific. If you want a great Asian delivery night in, Green Onion won't disappoint.  Expect longer delivery times during peak hours, but their staff is pleasant enough, especially since it sounds like they are always busy!"}
{"text":"Out of business, now there is a Burrito place there. Same goes to Thai-One-On next door, they are closed as well."}
