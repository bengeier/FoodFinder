When you enter a Caribbean restaurant, one thing you can always be assured on is the portions - much like Italian restaurants, portions is a part of the authentic experience.

I'm not sure if there's some sort of chicken drought or something but to pay a premium for what amounted to a bed of rice so sparse I could see the bottom of the box and two of the most anemic drumsticks I ever did see felt a bit off putting.

The food itself is fair...not the best I've had in the city (lookin at you Rasta Pasta, Raps, Town Talk) and FAR from the worst (Albert's...your rice tastes like cheese - pick up our socks guys) but the portions alone just felt insulting; I was ordering for me, not an infant.

End Result: if you're in a rush and are craving it, then go ahead - but if you have time OR if you're actually hungry, find something else"}
{"text":"My hubby and I ordered take out from One Love kitchen last night. We shared the chicken curry and jerk chicken dinners.  Both dishes were on point- tons of spice with just the right amount of heat.  And the option of baked plantains and quinoa & peas? Pure genius!!  It was healthy yet still somehow delicious!

I was shocked to read the negative yelp reviews referring to small portion sizes. Listen up TO chubbers, the portion sizes are completely reasonable and probably what all restaurants should be serving. 

We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to Toronto and we were up for anything. We'd been walking up and down Queen Street on a balmy 25 Fahrenheit day so we were freezing. We just popped in hoping for something to warm us up and rejuvenate our weary legs. We didn't know what to expect but the smell of curry and steaming rice welcomed us. Our hearts lifted immediately! This place is small and clean and very promising. 
I ordered the Coconut infused Curry Chicken. It warmed me up from the inside out and warmed up my mouth too. Definitely sniff worthy. Such large portions that I had to force myself to stop. My boyfriend had the Char Grilled Jerk Chicken. It was cooked expertly and had lots of flavor. Each dish had lots of rice so be ware if your Paleo. 

This place was delicious and totally worth a second visit. 

I love 1 Love Kitchen"}
{"text":"With staying in Toronto in the downtown for vacation, I came upon this Caribbean shop looking for Jerk Chicken. I must say the food was tasty here, but I am a woman who loves her spice being half Trini and Jamaican and could have done with more seasoning on the chicken. 
Over all though the meal was tasty, fresh, more on the healthy side, and reasonable priced. I will go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"So the Healthy Greek shut down and 1 Love Kitchen opens advocating healthy Caribbean cuisine. I was very excited to try their curry chicken so that's exactly what I ordered on my first visit! 

I was disappointed not only because of the small portions - the curry was on top of a very thin layer of rice - but because everything tasted watered down, including the curry itself and the coleslaw on the side. I've never tasted coleslaw that wasn't creamy so the watery taste was quite unpleasant. 

The layout has not changed from when the place used to be the Healthy Greek, but they need a lot more lighting - it is way too dark inside if you're eating in. The McDonalds style garbage disposal added to the fast food ambiance, but for the price to portion/taste ratio, I would prefer to go to Mickey Dees.

It's difficult to create delicious food with healthy cooking and 1 Love Kitchen definitely needs improvement. I'm not sure why there are raving reviews, but the food here definitely lacks flavor."}
{"text":"In this super casual, cafeteria-style restaurant, a large green polyvinyl silhouette cutout of Bob Marley greets you in the seating area where you should get together and feel alright.  Heh heh heh. 

The friendly lady at the counter with a Caribbean accent welcomed us to grab a seat and read through the menu if we hadn't yet made our dish decisions yet.  With a kindly \"What you want, honey?\"  I picked the goat curry roti while my friend chose jerk chicken, adding an extra dollar for the baked plaintain. 

Oh oh oh, I have to put it out there in the Yelp world right now that my friend purposely left out the byline of 1 Love Kitchen: it's *healthy* Caribbean food.  Yuck, what is this healthy bidniss?  S, you trickster.  

It turned out to be OK though, as the goat curry was still super flavourful.  A little too much on the salty side, but this is hypertension talking, not necessarily my taste buds.  My friends' jerk chicken had a 3-chilli label denoted on the menu, warning that it should be considered an extra spicy level.  I stole a bite, and would've personally listed it as mild-low medium at max, maybe because I had been expecting a ton of gut-burning Scotch bonnets in it.  The baked plaintain was sweet, with the blackened surface having been caramelized by the heat. 

My goat curry was wrapped in a whole wheat roti and was pretty tasty, strong in goat flavour, with bits of potato in it to help soak up more curry sauce.  I would say it's good if you like goat, but for someone like my friend who dislikes game meats it \"Tastes like crayons and boiled wool.\"  Yum. 

There were a couple other tables in use while we were there but was otherwise more of a takeout place without too many people, so it's a viable option for anyone in a bit of a rush to eat quickly without any wait time.  Credit cards are accepted."}
{"text":"Friendly French speaking folks who work here.  

I wanted a snack and got the jerk chicken wrap for $6.95.  It was the meat from one chicken leg wrapped into a whole wheat tortilla with some shredded lettuce and tomatoes and some dressing.  It was pretty small.  The flavour was good though.  For the price you pay and what you get, I'm sorry, but it just wasn't worth it.  

I'm sure the rent ain't cheap but you need to give better portions or reduce your prices to gain some fans!"}
{"text":"It was the \"fresh, healthy\" in the window  that got me. It was true. For under ten dollars I got four plantain pieces baked in coconut (sadly, fried is better) and a large Caribbean-style chicken soup with carrots, potatoes, and a fabulous spice mixture that left my mouth tingling pleasantly. 

I call myself vegetarian but I do cheat with chicken soup when I'm not feeling up to snuff. So for friends reading this, yes you can rib (ahem) me about this. Especially since I just read Nicholas Kristof's article on industrial chicken farming. 

But returning to I Love Kitchen: the decor is that of a no-frills lunch counter, the staff are nice, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm of Trini decent. Caribbean people LOVE their fried plantain. I was told that this place bakes theirs, so I gave it a try. I was given a box of charcoal. Inedible trash. PEOPLE, go to ONE LOVE VEGETARIAN on Bathurst north of bloor. AMAZING AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The food itself tastes just fine. but for carribean food, it's definitely pricey for the small portion you get, especially considering many other quality carribean places in the area."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new jerk chicken joint but disappointed by the small portions. Went around 5pm on a weekday but they said they only had 3 items on their menu available (jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail). Jerk chicken was average (warm, a bit dry and not that flavorful) - would be able to find a cheaper alternative for an even bigger proportion elsewhere"}
{"text":"Hit this place to break the monotony of lame hotel food during a week long meeting.

The decor is very modest with bright green slightly more appealing that Wahlburger's horrible shade.  

The concept is quick Caribbean food.  I ordered the Jerk Chicken and Veggy Lover's delight.  Just a quick note...they didn't have buckwheat roti as it states on their website.  I was told it just didn't take off.  

The food was good and the portions were hearty.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and moist.  The veggie lover's (ie. chickpea curry) was well developed and had a nice bite to it. The rice and peas were authentic and delicious. I enjoyed the slaw but the overn baked plantains were a let down. 

They also take Belly, a newer reward program which allows for one app to used at a number of places, eliminating the need for 15 lunch half stamped lunch cards.

Chances are you will be serenaded by Bob Marley tunes when you arrive.  They are not open late, however, so don't be tempted to go and order some grub after you engage in one of Marley's other \"hobbies\"."}
