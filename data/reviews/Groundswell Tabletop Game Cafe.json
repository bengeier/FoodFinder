{"text":"Man all their drinks are good! I had a sample of the honey milk tea and I have to say that it's the best I've ever tasted, especially in a city that has so many boba places with honey milk tea! Two drinks I recommend are the white chocolate almond roca and chocolate covered raspberry! As for teas, their dirty Paco is so good and original! Some of their teas have nice Hawaiian flavors and influence! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks! I had the Lowey which was so goood! And my fiancé had the pistachio latte I had a taste and that was delicious as well. hope to be back soon for some more drinks and to play some games!"}
{"text":"Five Stars! Came here one weekday evening with my sister and we had caramel lattes and played board games for a few hours. It is an awesome place for all ages! Their drink menu is a bit limited and i am not sure about their restroom, but overall it was so much fun and I will definitely go back! They do not charge you to play games and have every board/card game you colud ever think of. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is more than amazing. The reviews are true to their words and the owner Jupiter is probably one of the kindest people I have ever met. His coffee is probably the best in Vegas and to add games to the mix is a million dollar idea. My husband and I found this place in yelp by accident and planned on going there for thirty minutes but ended up staying for six hours haha. 
Jupiter explains all games to you and can even recommend according to what you are looking for. He genuinely cares about every person that walks in there and what I thought was so special is no matter who walked in the vibe was always so inviting. Everyone was happily talking to each other even if you didn't know one another. 
I am so happy we found this place and I will continue to support this business for a long time and hope it can only keep growing. Everyone must go here!!! Meant for all ages as well! Love love love Ground Swellings"}
{"text":"This place is so fun and the drinks are delicious. I always come here with friends and lose track of time playing with board games. The baristas are always friendly"}
{"text":"Found Groundswell via Groupon. 2 drinks and 2hrs game play for $22. 

Coffee: 5/5 phenomenal. I got the peppermint mocha. Espresso was Legit! Peppetmint flavor was on point.

Games: 5/5. All the classic/popular games are there monopoly, risk, cards against humanity settlers of catan, etc. Some games were brand new. Like Colonist which was Settlers of Catan on steriods. 

Ambience: Hipster

10/10 highly recommend and would return."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite new spot. They have a huge variety of games that give you hours of fun. My favorite drink is the El Paco. Ask for it dirty. It's refreshing and delicious. The staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable. Overall I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Me and the boys had so much fun playing the board games the coffee was just ok or maybe it was just what we got but we had fun great idea"}
{"text":"The coffee was meh. The gentleman helping us though was very friendly. I didn't really know what the place was about and only saw the games in the photos. I didn't realize that to play with the games there was an additional charge. They do however offer happy hour pricing for game play time, and they didn't say anything for us taking up a table to just sit and have coffee (w/o paying for game time)"}
{"text":"Great place to come and spend 2 hours. This is strictly a coffee place so don't come hungry. Good selection of games and cards. They have some live music but I have been here twice and not on a mic night. The concept of a game and beverage place is one I love and seek out. (My favorite one is in Copenhagen). This one is on the small side so even though they have twister as an offering don't plan on playing it."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and its so cute! Not lying when I say the iced pistachio latte is the best one Ive ever had, much better than Serenade. The nutella latte was good too, very creamy, but not much nutella flavor in it. Service was great. Cashier was really nice and I'm guessing the owner came up to us and asked if we wanted to demo a game. 
-1 because prices are a tad higher than average and teas dont have descriptions. They have so many games including the fancier strategy games. From what I saw on the menu it looks like games are per person and different for adults and kids. I think it would be better if they charged per group. Great place to come at night with your family and friends! Will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I recently set up a game night here with a group of friends, and we had a pretty good time. In addition to gaming and cafe beverages, they also have a stage for open mic night. Several people were gaming without drinking, or coming in for a takeout drink without gaming. They're adding a food menu next month, and I'll be scheduling another game night to check that out too.

PROS:
+ Friendly staff, Jupiter and Kristina were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit.
+ Games available for play (400+) or purchase, whichever you prefer.
+ I liked the old school decor and the gaming trivia in the bathroom.
+ It's not super loud or super brightly lit, more comfortable than other spots.

CONS: 
- Drink menu needs some work. Out of 7 drinks ordered, two were pretty good (POG and Liquid Gold) while most others were unbalanced (too sweet, too strong, too bitter, too artificial). They offered to remake drinks though. Wonder if they'll be adding boba in the future.
- Games are not organized in any particular system. They don't have a huge amount to where it's overwhelming or frustrating but some sort of organization whether by age group, time commitment, or cooperative/competitive would be helpful for those unfamiliar with board games.

Looking forward to revisiting. Location isn't super convenient for frequent visits but I will definitely be back and prefer this location to others for group events. 

TIP: Don't purchase the Groupon, they'll honor the deal in store."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here to grab a coffee and play a few games, and we never disappointed! Their coffee is delicious (we usually get Lowey) and the staff is super friendly and helpful! Specially I want to mention RJ - super nice guy that works there. Whenever we come to play board games and ask for recommendations, he always takes time to show us a new game and explain the rules. It's pretty awesome! A couple of games that he showed us became our absolute favorites, and we even bought them to play at our house. This place is kids friendly and family oriented, so bring everyone with you! But keep in mind that they don't have much food and snack selection, so don't come super hungry. Anyway, I love this coffee shop and their idea of playing board games with people instead of staring at your phone screen. We will be definitely coming back here many times."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cafe to go to! They have so many board games to choose from and the coffees are delicious! The salted caramel and almond roca are some of my favorites. What I loved about this place is that during our first visit, the barista RJ asked if we wanted any games demoed and we ended up playing for an hour with him and we learned a bunch of fun games. Jupiter is the owner and he's super nice! For the most part whenever we visit, he's always there greeting us and making game suggestions. I've brought multiple friends here and they've all loved it. Definitely love this place and will continue going here!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and play games with friends if you are in the area and don't want to do anything too crazy at night. The space is really nice and they have all the best games to choose from. 

Super affordable and the staff is amazingly friendly. The drinks are alright and pretty creative. I would say their drinks tend to be on the sweet side. I would like to see other drink options and food as well in the future. 

I think that if you just want to hang with friends and do something fun and nostalgic, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Just went here today and I had an amazing time experiencing the nostalgia of playing the board games that took over most of my childhood. 
My boyfriend got the Honey Green Milk Tea and he said that he really enjoyed it. I ordered the Geisha Latte which is made with white chocolate and matcha and I also tried their White Peppermint Latte which I really recommend.
The customer service was fantastic. They assist you with how to play any of their board games when you feel like trying one you've never played before. There was also no wait after I ordered my drink."}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful cafe I have ever been to! Why? Because its the best of both worlds, boardgames and homemade pistachio lattes !!! But one of the greatest things about this place is their customer service, the staff and owner Jupiter especially, always show my friends and family a funnn time by recommending us new games and actually showing us step by step how to play! I think its what sets them apart from other cafes, the way they take their time to help and it shows how much they care about their customers, you definitely won't regret giving them a visit (((:"}
{"text":"Fair trade coffee and in house roast beans. They have a wonderful arraignment of drinks. All of their lattes are great. They make their own pistachio milk for one of their lattes which is one of my top drinks from here. My toddler loves their sourdough bread grill cheese. The owner and employees are very friendly and helpful. It's a great place to play games for all ages. They have so much selection, it's hard to figure out which game to play first. Games are free to play as long as you order a drink. We have quality family game nights here, it's a great place for family's and groups of any size."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with hundreds of board games to choose from. They have a very unique menu with delicious coffee and choices for kids as well."}
{"text":"Great idea and they use Averys roastery for their coffee!  That means the coffee is yummy!  The customer service is great!  They just need to grow a little!  Support them, they deserve it! I highly recommend an AEROPRESS!"}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just to write a review on how amazing I think this place was when I went to go try it out. The interior is very cutely designed and even the restroom has adorable doodles on the walls. The customer service was fantastic with really pleasant attitudes and the desire to assist customers with any questions regarding the board game they are playing. I will definitely return here to study or just have a chill night out with friends. I played Risk for the first time here and I am absolutely obsessed with the game. I tried the Geisha Latte and the Annie Palmer and really enjoyed them."}
{"text":"So fun there! I can't wait to go back and play a different board game! The best drink was the Earl grey tea and shots of espresso. Be sure to ask for almond milk if you are vegan :) The barista was so kind to change it out for my friend and I as we forgot to ask about other milk alternatives."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my sister, she got the pistachio latte and I got the Lowey a chocolate Nutella latte. The pistachio latte was one of the best lattes I've ever had! It had a great pistachio flavor and it was very smooth and tasty! Great coffee place for friends and family to have a drink and play games. This place is very cute with tons of board games. Prices are a little high but for the quality of the coffee its worth it. The service was great, we also got to meet (who I believe was one of the owners) he asked us if we would like to demo one of the board games. Unfortunately we didn't have time to play, but both the service and quality of their coffee was fantastic! This is definitely my new favorite coffee shop! A little tip if you ever decide to go is: Happy Hour 2-5pm games are half priced!"}
{"text":"This is one my family's favorite chill spots. Jupiter and RJ are always so friendly and helpful.  So clutch with the drinks; Emilio, Arnold Schwarzen-Palmer, and PO Double G are legit!!!  It's a great way to get away from the phone screen and enjoy good old-fashioned board games like Monopoly, Risk, and my New Favorite Cash and Guns"}
{"text":"OKAY SO I'M A SUCKER FOR BOARD GAMES AND CHILL ATMOSPHERES and this place is just 10/10!!! Service was wonderful! The server was extremely sweet and kind and patiently explained all the drinks for me!!! I liked the Liquid Gold Tea (tasted like a honey comb, imo). I want to try the other drinks when I come back!! Definitely supportive of this cute local business and would love to come back again! :)"}
{"text":"I tried the Pistachio Latte with an extra shot of espresso.  For me, while the pistachio flavor was good, the drink was incredibly sweet.  Just too much for my taste. On top of that, it certainly was not worth $8+.  
 The idea of paying $5 to play some used board games seems pretty steep to me as well. A max of $2 seems more appropriate to me, or better yet, just make the games part of the visit, especially when the coffee is so highly priced, that should be pricing in the cost of the game play."}
{"text":"The place has really good coffee! Nevertheless, it does not have pastries. You really need pastries to have a complete a coffee experience! (IMO)
Also they do had the great idea of incorporating table games. 
The game's look like a fun thing to do while sipping on java. 
However they charge to play the games! I wanted to play the games,  but I did not wanted to pay $7 to play them. 
If this place offers pastries and free games they will have to expand because the line would be out the door!

I truly hope they make changes based on this review and become a successful coffee place"}
{"text":"I finally visited Ground Swell, and it was awesome! The coffee shop had 100's of unique games to rent out and play, and even scheduled game nights. I had the \"Soap\" a Lavender and cardamom infused iced milk latte.  The barista added a little blueberry and it was amazing. My husband had the El Paco tea, it was delicious and tasted a little spicy! Yummy.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot! Our barista was knowledgeable and incredibly sweet, took the time to help us pick the perfect drink and succeeded! Definitely recommend the chocolate raspberry latte (white chocolate) hot! Sooooo good. Owner was around lending a hand and took time to ask us about our experience and shared a little bit about his venture into the coffee shop business, rad dude. Recommend 10/10. Great place to play board games. SO. MANY. OPTIONS."}
{"text":"Love finding local gems like this! Really cute space, stage for open mic nights, an incredible amount of board games, and really creative drink menu. The barista was so kind and friendly, giving us drink recommendations that we loved. I had the bath bomb iced tea and it was very unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop! Went here for date night with the hubs. Nice look and feel. Love the cork tables. Funny clever menu items. Mostly coffee drinks and tea. Some snacks and sweets. I had an iced green tea. Hubs had the  swoll salted caramel late. He \"loved it, it was wonderful.\"

They had a HUGE selection of board games and card games to choose from. We played the \"mr. toast game\" and \"don't get bit.\" There were so many games that we would love to play next time. We had a really nice time and will be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go on my day off! Grab all your friends and come here! They have so many board games to choose from and they legitimately have bad ass coffee and bad ass board games! No lie in the name. Jupiter is the best! And he's the owner! Meet him and what he created when you come to Groundswell!"}
{"text":"I just so happened to drive past this shop on my way home from dinner. The front sign says that it is open until 11 pm except on Sundays but Yelp still says they're open until 9 pm. Hmm.

Well when I entered, there were shelves of so many board games. I got pretty excited but then I forgot that I came pretty late. So I guess I'll come back again with some friends to try out the games.

I ordered the iced salted caramel latte and it was good. I'm sure they've been open for awhile, I just don't get why I only discovered it now. It's definitely a cool spot to check out :-)"}
{"text":"This place is very cozy. The drinks are interesting, and despite the odd names, they taste pretty good! The have a nice selections of board games to choose from. I love the atmosphere of this place!"}
{"text":"They're different from other cafes.  There are table games that promote community interaction.  There's a small stage open for small group community events.  I asked them if they have open mic poetry lounge kinda stuff.  No but if anyone wants to, they can inquire on utilizing their facility for such interests!

I happened upon them after checking out Krazy Chicken a few doors over.  In their window they serve Pistachio Latte!  Heck yes gotta try it.  Then come to learn this place MAKES their OWN pistachio milk :)  You can't find pistachio milk in the stores.  Nice.  Original.

And the barista crew is laid back friendly.  They have offers - just sign up with a name and cell number to receive texts.  

Their deco concept is re-use materials.  I support the eco-friendly recycled re-use efforts.  And the place looks great!  Some of the furniture is antique; gives this cafe it's uniqueness.  

The plaza location is somewhat new so parking is still easy for now.  They're in Southwest (would like for them to be closer to Summerlin), but it's alright.  The drive isn't drastic.  They're fairly new.  Pistachio lovers gotta try their latte!"}
{"text":"We've been here 5 times and love it, and really want them to succeed.  However, I have to dock a star for inconsistency.  More detail below.
Pros:  awesome tasty drinks (dirty paco is my absolute favorite -- mango tea with tajin and tamarind straw), so many games and good old fashioned fun, great loyalty program, funky vibe, and very passionate staff/owners... you can tell they are really excited about their business
Issues:
-inconsistent execution.  We went once and were turned away because they had no cream.  Owner was out buying more at the store but was more than 30 minutes out.  Employee didn't say anything until after my drink was paid for, so had to go through the refund process and no offer for free drink in the future... so I left frustrated and empty handed.  Today there was no coffee due to supplier error... it's a coffee place with no coffee -- big issue.  Buy some regular coffee at least and offer that for free.  You are building a client base, and can't afford people walking out empty handed or they won't be back.  My biggest issue is the lack of staff knowledge on the drinks.  If that is your livelihood everyone in the store should know the recipe of every drink cold.  Today they were asked if they could make a London Fog tea since there was no coffee.  Employee said no because they are out of espresso, but he could make it without.  He could've looked at their recipe board to see London Fog is on the tea menu NOT the espresso or coffee side.  Last time we asked what something was and they had to go to a book.  Does not give you confidence in quality of drinks if employees don't know them.  And if you are ever out of something, offer a free drink for next time so that customer can come back... otherwise most people will never be back.  Also, service is painfully slow.  If there's one person ahead of you be prepared to wait.
Finally, they need to work on optimizing their hours.  1pm-5pm on a Sunday, arguably the best day to get a board game audience has made us decide to skip game play most weekends.  Today there were 4 tables at one point (and many more who walked away because of no coffee).  Sundays are the type of day to do this activity. 
I know the review sounds critical, but it's more because I want to see improvement.  The concept, drinks and staff are so great I want it to get to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of having a latte or tea and playing board games. Very kid friendly!! Especially when your children see games they love to play!! $2.50 for kids to play any board games and adults $5. I love this better than video games!! Plus you can't miss the charging station that says hang up the phone bro, its game night!! Great place to hang out with friends. The coffee here is legit and not to mention the Arnold schwartzen palmer ( twist on a classic black tea lemonade infused with a sweet, sour, and salty li-Hing plum powder!!! My new fav!!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a cool concept. The vibe is like being in the comfort of a home; a very cool home with chill music and sooo many cool board games. I didn't play board games. I just sat and sipped my incredible blueberry lavender latte. Amazing concept, very chill, eclectic environment and the latte is life changing. I found my new hangout."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Groundswell Legit Coffee and Board Games today! Amazing honey milk teas, coffee & board games.  We had great customer service & Jacob took care of us!  He recommended different teas and coffee and I ended up ordering the honey milk tea & my fiance ordered the green honey milk tea! So so good! 

So many different games to choose from which was amazing. Jacob even recommended three games for us to play!  We also met Jupiter who recommended some games as well!

So happy we came in!  Such an amazing concept.  We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Iced pistachio latte. Love at first sip. That is all.

Lol just kidding, but seriously it is one of the best pistachio drinks I've ever had. The espresso in it isn't overpowering and you can really taste the pistachio milk, it's so delicious. I live 35 minutes away from here and would drive here just for this drink!

Besides that this place is super cute! They have a phone charging wall and a great selection of board games that you can play and some that you can buy. Definitely a good place to hangout with friends or study."}
{"text":"I organized a game day here and 10 of us came here at 1pm today.

I had called them a few days ago & they are having promotion  $5 per person unlimited play! If anyone stays for 2 hrs, it's free. When we showed up, we bought coffee and the girl said if we get a drink we can just play unlimited, didn't need to pay the additional $5.

The place is quaint and bright. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They have a good range of games like Card Against Humanity, Taboo, Catan, and a new fun game we played called 'What do you meme.' 

The atmosphere is laid back, and the coffee and tea were delicious. They also sell some sandwiches.

I didn't see any staff to teach you how to play. After couple of hours playing, a huge group of teenagers came in and the place became too loud so we left.

Overall, this place is fun for the whole family, no matter the age and it's super affordable!"}
{"text":"Great meeting place for game-crazy friends or, a really good cup of coffee, read your favorite book, relax."}
{"text":"The coffee lived up to the name \"LEGIT\" I purchased the white chocolate almond roca latte.. the employees were super helpful, and one of them was having fun playing and explaining a board game with some customers. 

I will def recommend my friends and family."}
{"text":"Such an awesome addition to the SW neighborhood!  To be honest, I had low expectations of this place. I didn't figure the drinks would be any good and I didn't think anyone else would be there. I was definitely wrong on both counts. First: the drinks. They have an extensive menu of traditional and very creative coffees and teas. The coffee smell of freshly brewed drinks is intoxicating. The drinks are fairly reasonably priced, ranging from about $4-$5.50 each. I decided on a honey green tea latte which was fantastic. It was lightly sweet and had a good flavor. My husband had the Arnold Schwartzwnpalmer, which is an iced tea and lemonade combo with mango flavor. He said it was very good as well. Second: the games. I expected maybe like 5 games to be there and for all of them to be lame. I was wrong! They have a huge selection of games to choose from. Many of which were things I had never heard of before. We enjoyed sitting and playing Trouble, Sorry, and Pandemic for almost 4 hours! The whole time, the place was consistently busy. Groundswell is a gem and a must location for any upcoming date nights of friend get togethers."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon to try this place out. My hubby and I made a mid-week afternoon date out of coffees and game play. So many games to choose from (a wall with many shelves!) and we really liked our Salted Caramel Lattes! The owner, Jupiter, even gave us a refresher on Monopoly and dealt us our starter money flow for the game. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"i highly recommend this place for people who just want to chill and play board games with friends.. family or significant others.. awesome chill laid back atmosphere.. cant wait to attend one of their events"}
{"text":"New to the Southwest and super stoked to have this quaint coffee house with a cool, chill vibe that emphasis their love for board games--yes--actual board games! Nice clean vintage decor. Check it out. They have almond and rice milk as well for the non-dairy enthusiasts. Love the various flavors and concoctions they offer. GREAT COFFEE!!! Gonna love having this as a hangout to work and get some board game time in."}
{"text":"This is the best idea since sliced bread!
A game parlor (non-electronic) where you can take the family and sip wonderful pistachio lattes! Tweeners are welcome to play board games and not mess up mom's house. There is no alcohol, and the environment is safe and fun! Try new board games before buying. Kill a couple of hours while sis gets her hair done."}
{"text":"Such a fun idea. We made a new habit of dropping our car for a car wash and popping in here to have a coffee and play board games. 

Lattes are scrumptious and they have snacks, bars and treats too. I was bummed they didn't have skim/lowfat milk. 

Pricing is always a surprise so it's hard to say what you'll be charged. We've been charged $1 each child to play games when we bought coffee and snacks or we've been charged nothing. There's pricing posted thats different as well so not sure what that's all about. Apparently it's based on their mood and discretion. 

There are loads of fun games to play both new and old. It's comfy and cute inside and they are very nice. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Seeing that my last post was removed for lack of information... So they say.  I'll be more clear.  My fiance and I stopped for a cup of coffee.  The kid making the coffee seemed to have no clue what he was doing.  Told us after we paid that they were out of milk and we ordered lattes.  Substituted with almond milk which we hate and then made our coffees so syrupy they were undrinkable... We threw them away as soon as we got home. So Legit Coffee, please don't contact yelp to have negative comments removed because that is not a true representation of the service or product you provide."}
{"text":"Worst coffee I ever had.. apparently owner left trainee by herself and it took 20 minutes for a coffee.. never coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with family and friends. We've come here a couple of times with the kids and have enjoyed the experience"}
{"text":"I work near this location and was anxiously awaiting their opening. The staff is friendly and helpful. The drinks are tasty and there is a great selection of games to play in a clean, neat space. Stop in and support this local business!"}
{"text":"Loved the Salted Caramel Latte. Great games, good selection even for just two players. We'll definitely be back soon with more time and friends to try out some other games."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and tea!! The games are so fun and the atmosphere is so chill! The service is outstanding! I recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time few days ago. Good customer service. Nice concept (board games while enjoying coffee). Coffee was okay, nothing extraordinary, but not bad either. The inside could be a bit more cozy, the coffee counter is all the way in the back, random empty space up by the entrance (maybe add small tables?). Maybe they just opened up and might still be working out the layout of the café. Wish they offered some accompaniments for coffee (pastries, coffee cakes)."}
{"text":"This is seriously the coolest coffee shop. Not only is the Pistachio Iced Latte amazing but the amount of board games here is crazy! There's literally something for everyone here. 

Plenty of large tables to bring a group and play games on. Super clean and friendly place. Jupiter is the coolest guy. Most of the games are from his own personal collection. When I come back to town I'll definitely be bringing my niece here!"}
{"text":"Legit!!! That is all I can say about the coffee at this joint. They just started roasting their own coffee beans and you can taste the notes in the coffee like chocolate and nuts. The way they brew the coffee here you don't taste the burnt bean taste like some places do, I don't drink coffee to often because of that taste so when I find a place that gives me the smooth low acidic taste and bring out the true flavor of a coffee bean I stick with it, this place is just no exception. I'm glad to have finally just stopped in and tried the coffee here. 

Ava who helped us her was just very nice and giving us suggestions that I'd definitely be back to try them all, my wife ordered the almond roca white chelate latte iced coffee and it was BOMB!. I'm gonna try the pistachio latte next visit.

There are also so many board games you could come here to play with a group of people to make the fun worth it but for the winter season 2018 you can come in a play games free with no rental fee.

Just come down and try it for yourself and see how good they roast their beans."}
{"text":"\"Nerd tech\" is such a cute name for the barista. 

Must try the pistachio latte!! This place knows what a real pistachio latte is... Why?!?! Because it comes with espresso and they make their own pistachio milk. Other little coffee stop use the green pistachio powder with milk to make their pistachio lattes.. It is that good that I drive from Henderson just for this! Lol."}
{"text":"Came in just for the coffee. Coffee was delicious - had the chocolate covered raspberry latte. Great quality. Love the decor of the place as well. Didn't have time to try the board games, but I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love the decor in here.  The cork tabletop is a genius idea.  It prevent loud nosies from the board games.  I have to say, I'd never seen so many board games all in one place in my life.  It's actually quiet in here even with people doing their own thing.  There were two people talking on their phones on business calls I believe.  Usually those people are so annoyingly loud.  Very surprisingly quiet.

We ordered the salted caramel latte and double shot of espresso.  The drinks are tasty.  Better quality than Starbucks I would have to say.  We'll be coming back. =D"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to CONNECT with your people vs meeting them in VIRTUAL LA LA LAND ( social media ) Lol!! Its cheap to play games since the rates are per day .. not per hour. Tons of board games to play with . Love love love this place . Try it out with friends and family and RECONNECT again !!!"}
{"text":"Being a family man that raises two kids in the middle of Sin City, it can be quite a task to find anything \"family-friendly\". Sure, there's your average movie theater and bowling alley, but movie hopping and bowling with bumpers can definitely get old.  I'm glad to have discovered the Groundswell Board-game Cafe.  It's creative, it's interactive and simply entertaining.  

From nostalgic games like Hungry Hungry Hippo and Battleship, to games unheard of such as Coupe and Get Lucky, with a wall stock-piled with cardboard boxes of fun, you'll never run out of things to do.  The greatest thing about all of this is that it's super cheap!  $5 a head gets you unlimited game play and a member of the staff will answer any question one might have on how to play a particular game.  

Groundswell also has an extensive drink menu and I'm excited to try each and every one of them during my future visits.  On my first visit, I ordered the Milk Tea, the Honey Green Milk Tea and the Sarsaparilla Milk Tea, which was my fave out of the three.  The Sarsaparilla Milk tea tasted like a root beer float melted in all its creamy goodness and poured over ice.  If you're hungry, they also offer munchies such as sandwiches, candy and chocolate.  

Groundswell is the perfect place for family night, date night and group gatherings.  Take a break from all the electronics and get in touch with your ol' skool self with a board-game or two.  If you have kids, this is a great opportunity to show them how we Baby-Boomers and Millennials used to get down!  Groundswell is truly LEGIT!"}
{"text":"The friendly owner worked hard to make sure our large group of 14 was accommodated, despite being short on staff (employee called in sick) on a busy Saturday afternoon. I had a delicious hot chocolate and enjoyed the assortment of board, card and dice games in a cozy atmosphere. The \"free play\" winter special is a plus, and I hope that it continues with the purchase of a drink from their extensive coffee menu."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. We stopped in here on our way home the other day. We just moved into the area and drive by it every night so we wanted to see what they were about here. It's a pretty cool business. They sell specialty coffees and have a library of board games to play and choose from. If you only want to play games it's like 5 to 7 dollars. If you buy a coffee it comes included. I had a cold \"lowey\" coffee and it was delicious. My man got a French press coffee and liked it, too. We didn't stick around to play games, but we saw that \"what do you meme\" game and decided to sit down and look at the cards while we sipped our coffees for a few minutes. This is definitely a good hang out or date spot. They also do open Mic nights and stuff, too. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Incredible coffee! When I wasn't sure what to order,(pre-coffee brain), the barista shared his favorites and helped me choose. 
The pistachio latte is delicious! They use pistachio infused milk that they make in-house. 
The vibe here is so fun and approachable! It would be easy to be productive and get work done orrrr get distracted with the huge board game selection... depending on what you're after. 
I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Honey Milk Tea!!!! Hands down, best in Vegas!! They come up with signature drinks that are all a MUST try. Have you ever heard of a board game cafe?? Me neither! Until Groundswell! You can chill with a yummy drink and pick a fun game to play...they even have folks that will come give you a game tutorial! Come check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a date night and had a blast.  She picked up a Groupon for two drinks and gameplay and we decided to use it around 4pm on a Saturday. 

The shop remained pretty crowded for the four hours we were there. I honestly lost track of time because I was having so much fun. I didn't look at my phone the entire time we were there and that isn't normal for me. 

They have great drink options but their menu is a little difficult because there aren't any descriptions for some of the drinks. My only complaint with the food/beverage portion of the establishment was the service seemed slow. There were two people working but one person seemed to be doing all the work. It seemed based off my observations that the sandwich machine was broken that day as people were bringing in outside food options. 

They have so many board games! Some I hadn't seen since my childhood. It was so fun to play some games I hadn't played in years as well as find and try some new ones. My only complaint here would be that a good number of the games we pulled were missing directions and it makes it hard to learn to play. 

Overall, great little shop. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the cutest coffee shop! They have over 100 board games and fun atmosphere! I recommend this place, it is a 10/10!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The owner Abigail is a delight!!!! I'm usually a coffee girl but Abigail suggested a milk tea.  Needless to say, their drinks are fantastic and they have a plethora of board games!! I can't wait to bring all of my friends there!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! My group of friends and I always have game nights and we were really happy to find out that not only is it a game board shop closeby to where we live but also a place to have some \"legit\" yummy coffee! 

We usually love to come in on Tuesdays when gameplay is only $1 per person and they also have Monopoly Monday where all Monopoly games are free! It's a great place to play with a friend or a whole group of people since there's a variety of games; usually if you don't know how to play a game, a \"nerd technician\" will sit down with your group and help guide you throughout the rules of the game. 

Their drinks are really delicious! My favorites have been the Liquid Gold Milk Tea, the Honey Green Milk Tea and the LowKey. They have many more drinks that are very unique in flavor and ingredients and not just your typical latte. Trust me, you'll be coming back for more just for their coffee/teas!

They also have an awesome rewards system that will send you texts about promos or freebies if you stack up enough points! The owner Jupiter is always super friendly and welcoming and we're really glad to have such a cool and fun shop nearby!"}
{"text":"Super yummy drinks, great service and great vibe over all! There are hundreds of games, o this is a great place for a unique date night or family fun!"}
{"text":"I had a salted caramel coffee this morning. Perfect! Just smooth and tasty, not too sweet. The owner is really nice. Overall a great atmosphere. I will be back."}
{"text":"I really liked the setup of this place. It has a nice homey atmosphere despite its smaller space. They made great use of designing the place by the placement of the lighting, painting the walls, and even their choices in tables and chairs. I found all of this very aesthetically pleasing. My group also went during a time when there was no board game playing fees so that was a plus!

The selection of games is somewhat small, but we still found something that the my group of 5 could enjoy that wasn't Monopoly or Risk. We all tried a various drink off of their drink menu and it turned out great! Sadly this place doesn't offer much for food but there are several places in the area to purchase and bring inside. 

I really appreciated RJ taking time at the end of the night to show my group how to play a new game! It was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I am a pretty low key person when it comes to activities outside of the home. Its not the Strip or the lights that appeal to me so it's kind of difficult to find a place that's my pace and that I can enjoy. Groundswell Legit Coffee and Board Games had their soft grand opening today and I have to say this place is awesome. They have over 300 different board and card games to play in a fun and relaxed environment. Their staff is super friendly and their drinks are amazing!! My absolute favorite is the Honey Milk Tea which, if you have ever had milk tea, this will blow it out of the water....Liquid Gold for sure. A close second would be the El Paco which has a Hispanic kick and a candy on a straw! The creativity that they've put into this business from the industrial decor- carefully selected games that are sure to be a big hit- to the menu of amazingly delicious drinks.... This place is fun for the whole family, no matter the age and super affordable! It truly is a class all its own and I would recommend anyone to make this their regular coffee spot! Their official Grand Opening will be held on New Year's Day so come check them out!"}
{"text":"I only visited here once to get a specialty coffee but I'm not sure I would return again. I ordered a chocolate hazelnut iced coffee which I believe was a little over $5. Due to be price and the drink being overly sweet, I don't feel that it was worth it.
If you are planning on just ordering a coffee and actually sitting to play all the numerous board games they have here then maybe it is worth it. But I wouldn't recommend it if you are just stopping to pick up a coffee."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and had soooo much fun! This place is truly a hidden little gem and our barista was the coolest gal ever. We got five drinks and enjoyed all of them, my only complaint is that the drinks do get a little pricey (but purchase of a drink gives you access to all board games). 

I got the \"Soap\" iced w/ soy, which is a lavender latte and I found it very fragrant and yummy! The bf got the PO-double-G (passion fruit guava) and it was really refreshing. We also got the Honey Green Milk Tea, London Fog, & White Chocolate Roca Latte - all of which my fam said they really liked. So glad this place is near my house and highly recommend if you're in the area (or not, it'll be worth the drive)"}
