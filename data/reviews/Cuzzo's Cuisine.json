{"text":"This is some good food. So it is in a kind of sketchy area but don't be afraid to go in. It is well kept inside and good relaxing music. I ordered the lobster mac and wings, my coworker had the lobster mac and shrimp, another had the fish and lobster mac and the last had the chicken and waffles. Let me tell you; the food is sooo great!!!! The sweet tea was good and their kumelon drink was awesome. It was a little pricey but it DEFINITELY worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster Mac and cheese as it seemed to be their claim to fame. There was no lobster in it. Only chunks of fake 'krab' meat. And it was so peppery that you couldn't even taste the fake 'krab'. How do they get away calling this lobster Mac? Never again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!   The first time I went I got the shrimp and grits, they were wonderful, and came in a huge portion. I was easily able to make two meals out of it for myself, and it was very reasonably priced for the portion.   The lobster mac is necessary. I've never had any complaints about the lobster/mac ratio personally. For me, it's about the spices that they use in the mac, they're out of this world.   On my second visit I got cajun dry-rub wings and those were fantastic as well. A coworker of mine got them on a previous occasion and said, \"I would fight someone who tried to take these wings from me.\"   Also, they were running a special on the day I went for the second time. Fried lobster mac balls and fries. My friend who I was eating with ordered these and they were awesome. Hope to see them as a menu item in the future."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious (especially the lobster mac & cheese) but I was treated rudely by one of the workers and one of the managers. I cannot give a good rating for poor customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here. Lobster Mac is to die for. Don't forget to ask for the cucumber lemonade it is legit."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers ever!!! Must try. They go to a lot of beer festivals and is always the best choice. You can find them based off their Instagram you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles was crazy good. I had the waffles with the cream cheese drizzle and the jerk chicken fingers.  Topping each quarter of waffle with a chicken finger and then dunk it in the jerk sauce - that combo of sweet and spicy - to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally found where the food truck people are located LOL.  I am in love with this place for their famous red velvet waffles with wings.  The icing that they put on those waffles are so good you don't even eat syrup and the red velvet waffles are so delicious unlike any other waffle.  My husband and I finally found their restaurant location after looking for their truck on numerous late nights when we were on a red velvet waffle crave and they never seem to disappoint.  The people in the restaurant were very courteous and remains professional and greeted us the environment was cool and I like the fact that everyone was nice and had a great vibe.  We also try their famous lobster mac and cheese and that was delicious so we will definitely be back again and I'm so glad that we found the actual restaurant so we don't have to chase the food truck!"}
{"text":"Food made to order was hot and fresh! I see why people rave about the lobster Mac and cheese defy a must try. I recommend this to others. Kumelon lemonade was good as well had a hint of cucumber."}
{"text":"OMG. Had a combo of Cajun  wings, shrimp and lobster Mac and cheese.  Out of this world good for your tummy. Highly recommend either the food truck or actual restaurant. Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is even better!! I used to get the fried shrimp and lobster mac and cheese until I got my hands on the jerk fish. Lord whhyyyyyy is it so good. I got a chance to meet one of the owners and he goes beyond and ensure you're having a great experience. This is my go to spot when I have friends and family are in town. Must try!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, and lively atmosphere. Had the lemon pepper chicken wings...very very tasty. My husband had the fried shrimp- nicely seasoned and fried to perfection served with hot sauce and tarter sauce. Love the lobster mac and cheese-very rich. The portion was large and when i go again I'll probably split with my dining partner. The watermelon lemonade is a must try. Very sweet and refreshing. Convenient parking."}
{"text":"My 1st time... I ordered lemon pepper wings and the lobster mac, omg it was awesome. My husband ordered fish and shrimp with fries he said it was pretty decent.  Normally he wouldn't eat anything with lobster because he doesn't like the taste but the lobster mac changed his mind. He loves it and is hard to please. And the Kumelon loved every single drop. Not too sweet it was just right. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food was good but servings were too small for the price they charged. Hopefully the buffet on Sundays is better. Establishment is small. Music and customer service was good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I recommend the lobster Mac n Cheese and the Jerk wings. The peach cobbler waffle too is awesome. I haven't tried anything else food wise yet but I will be going back! And they have this new pear lemonade of some sort, and it's delicious. The customer service is great and they cook the food to order, so expect the wait to be about 15-20 mins."}
{"text":"I had the lemon pepper wings and veggies. I have been trying to find good wings since I moved here last July. I have finally found my wing place. I tried my friend's lobster Mac and it was delicious and not heavy at all. The pear lemonade was to die for. It was really refreshing. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Cuzzo's is by far one of the  best and most authentic restaurants I've tasted in charlotte so far! Well seasoned, fresh food, wide variety and a clean place overall. I went to the Sunday brunch buffet. I typically don't do buffets but I liked the fact that the staff serves the food and is generous. The Yams  brought a tear to my eye. They tasted like an angel flew down from heaven and kissed the cook. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. I've been rocking with these guys since their food truck days. Can't lie it's a bit pricey but overall they food is delicious I always order the wings they are always seasoned to perfection. I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Had to use my GPS to get there, but glad we did. Lobster MacNCheese w/fried shrimp was so good! Ron enjoyed his wing 6 jerk, 6 lemon-pepper w/rice n beans. Don't forget that famous lemonade"}
{"text":"I'm not waste time with a long thread. If you don't try this place you're crazy. I've been coming to CLT for years and the shrimp and lobster Mac was insane!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: You have been forewarned.   Do not, I repeat, do not get the lobster mac...unless you plan to make a trip here weekly or more. Seriously, if you are looking for a rich, indulgent, throw your diet to the wind type of place...Cuzzo's is it! So good! And, the jumbo shrimp are perfectly crispy. You MUST try the CuMelon Lemonade- a perfect compliment to any of their dishes.  The food is good, but the service is better. When you enter Cuzzo's you are greeted with a welcome, smile and excellent service. The staff are friendly and personable. You can tell that staff make a habit of learning the names and orders of regular patrons. I noticed that many staff referred to guests by name and many guests greeted staff by name.   The owner has created a great atmosphere including a spotless facility (I love to see tables cleared and cleaned quickly in a dining space), jazz  playing in the background, and ample seating.  As much as I wanted to try dessert, I simple could not. The portions are quite large and left me full for most of the day.   I will certainly return for brunch! Right after I lose the 5 pounds gained from the mac."}
{"text":"I love their jerk chicken wings and the lobster mac.  Great service and family owned!  They also have a food truck as well."}
{"text":"Cool laid back spot. Down south flavors that are bold and authentic. Enjoyed lemon peppered wings and lobster Mac and cheese. Hubby had wings and seasoned fries.  Everything was hit and delicious, definition of made to order.  Cashiers were very attentive and friendly. Would defiantly return."}
{"text":"I had the fried fish and shrimp with the lobster Mac and cheese. Decent portions but I believe it's cheaper to order everything a la carte instead of getting the combo. Service is ok and seating is basic. More of a to-go spot."}
{"text":"Some of the best shrimp I've had! Fried perfectly so that the shrimp is still moist and flavorful! The chicken wings with the chicken and red velvet waffle were a little dry...the chicken was a little tough but the waffle was great! and as always...the Lobster Mac is on point! The lemonade was refreshing and not too sweet too!"}
{"text":"OH MY..... lobster mac and cheese to die for!! This place does all the things right.  Great service, they greet everyone who walks in and take your name to call with your order.   The dining room and bathroom is so clean.  Nice background music.  The food is delicious.  I certainly hope people find this place and it stays in business."}
{"text":"Waited in line for over an hour to get some lobster mac and cheese.  Now, I am a real foodie, especially when it comes to italian and seafood.  This mac and cheese was WAY too peppery and had very little amount of meat in it.  What an incredible disapointment to not only wait an hr for this realloy sup par dish but to also pay $10 for 60cents worth of lobster meat.    This was either a horribly wrong dish or this truck is just another way too talked up spot to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is pretty good. I would go back when I get a taste for it. The first time I had the tenders and fries and this time I had the wings and fries and the lobster mac & cheese and it was good. The one thing I noticed is that whenever you get a combo it's supposed to be a deal but their combos are the same price as if you ordered things individually. So basically no deal."}
{"text":"D-lish! We were looking for a spot to eat and I turned to my Yelp friends for a suggestion. You all didn't fail me...Cuzzo's is awesome. The staff are friendly and very helpful. We tried the fried shrimp and lobster mac, beef empanadas, wings, and shrimp tacos. Plus we had the kumelon drink,  strawberry banana pudding and the cinnamon chips...all were awesome...let's put it this way...we made happy plates! Thanks Cuzzo!"}
{"text":"The New Sunday Buffet is my favorite soul food escape! I come from rock hill every week for it! The employees are also friendly and give generous portions so this is my favorite black owned restaurant. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great spot in Charlotte to get good authentic soul food-southern cooking and Cuzzos has answered the call! Great food. Great service. All around great.  It probably doesn't matter to most people but I love that they using whiting for their fish instead of the tilapia or catfish you see at most places.   Everything is perfectly seasoned and taste fresh. I can't recommend this spot enough."}
{"text":"Just ordered food from the truck outside NoDa Brewery and could not be more disappointed. Waited 30+ minutes on a very empty stomach. Ordered the Red Velvet chicken and waffles. Waffle was soggy and red was food coloring, not a traditional red velvet. \"Chicken\" was 3 scrawny chicken wings that were very dry and flavorless. Syrup ice old. Thankfully my friends ordered the lobster mac n cheese so I could have some bites and not go starving. That's what the one star is for. And for the lady taking orders. She was nice."}
{"text":"I had the lobster Mac and Cheese and mint cucumber lemonade.  There was about a 15 minute wait ( they told me that there would be about 10 minutes until my order was up) and it was so worth it.  Delicious.  I will be back.  Tomorrow, if they are out.  I want to try the shrimp and grits next.  Friendly service.  My new favorite food truck."}
{"text":"I try to support Black-owned businesses. This one I raved about after seeing an invite for their restaurant site grand opening on Facebook about 3 months ago. Even took a picture w/ the owner and urged my family members to go...which they did and we made it a monthly, even bimonthly (at times) family meal outing. So, when I saw that they \"were\" a participating restaurant on Restaurant.com and that the site had a deal going on for cyber Monday, I jumped to it...again, even reached out to family members to purchase certificates...which my sister did as well! I called to make sure they would honor my deal, but they have no recollection of it. Even spoke to Curtis who spoke w/ one of the managers who stated they would honor my certificate. However when I got to the restaurant, claimed 1 of 4 of my certificates, all of a sudden the best they could give me is 25% off. I clearly stated over the phone what the deal was (purchase $50 of food and get $25 off). He said NOTHING about 25% off over the phone...his direct words were \"yes we will honor it\". I proceed to drive to the restaurant to show them what I was referring to...mind you again, I claimed my certificate. The hostess w/ curly natural hair, glasses who was wearing a striped top took my order, but I asked her not to place it until the owner spoke w/ a representative from Restaurant.com asking when/why/how were they apart of their organization without having consented. As I waited other staff members made their way to the front as one of them (a light skinned/white lady in a white chef coat and black hat w/her hair in a back bun) kept glancing my way. It was obvious that they were discussing my situation as the girl who took my order, the one w/ the curly natural hair w/ glasses and a striped shirt made the remarks to her coworkers \"it was just $2). After speaking w/ the manager, I made it clear to the hostess (in front of management) that \"if you're going to talk about your customers, the better thing to do would be to do it away from them or after they leave, but while they're there is so unprofessional.\" My demeanor was perfectly fine and even if the Restaurant.com situation couldn't have been resolved, I still would have placed an order because I USED to love their service & business. The food is amazing, but customer service & the discretion/interaction you have with your customer supercedes if they'll return. This customer will not! Check your first point of contacts!"}
{"text":"This place has me on such an emotional roller coaster.....I just don't know how I feel about the lobster Mac, their signature dish.  I've tried it 3 different times and had 3 different experiences.  The first time it was dry and no lobster to be found but the truck was new on the scene at that time so I tried it again on the truck, 2 weeks ago on a Thursday in uptown and it was very good,  full of lobster and creamy!  I thought it was so good I tried it again last Thursday but this time it had a scorched taste, no lobster and it was soupy.  What is really going on here?  I dunno, but I will say that the fish has always been good, the wings are small but good, wasn't a fan of the shrimp and grits, and the red velvet waffle has too much dye for my taste.  Lastly, the strawberry banana pudding is amazing.  I guess I'm trying too hard to like that lobster Mac, but a little consistency shouldn't be too much to ask for."}
{"text":"I have been chasing their food truck numerous time. It come to a point where the lady that work the truck know what I will order when I walked up.. Finally today I get to visit their storefront. And I couldn't been happier. You're greeted when you walked thru that door. The hostesses give some of the brightest smiles..   I ordered my usual which is the chicken and red velvet waffle..  my cousin ordered the jerk wings, lobster Mac and cheese with battered shrimps and some strawberry banana pudding.   I love my waffle. Crispy on the outside. And the wings was nicely seasoned with a special dry rub!   I will alway be a fine of Cuzzo Food Truck but if my craving get bad and I have find them.. now I have a store front to visit anytime!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite food truck. I would try my best to memorize their schedule. That way when I have bad craving. I know where to find them.  My favorite go-to is their chicken wings and red velvet waffle. I will have them separate the cream cheese syrup since it can easily make the waffle soggy. Red velvet waffle is not too sweet yet have a nice crust. And the wings have fantastic seasonings! Their famous lobster mac and cheese is a hit and miss for me. At times it can be too bland or too oily. So that's my favorite on the list.. There's other flavor wings you can pick from but I haven't try much of those since I'm still stuck on the red velvet and waffle. Unfortunately I will most likely keep eating that every time I visit this truck!"}
{"text":"I'm full! Sunday buffet! Was looking for red velvet waffles and ran into a Sunday buffet. EVERYTHING was on point. Collards were banging. Chicken was banging. The lobster mac and cheese, OFF THE CHAIN!"}
{"text":"Lobster mac and cheese is amazingggggggg.  The fried shrimp was awesome as well.  Def recommend this place"}
{"text":"When we walked in, we're slapped in the face with an overwhelming pine cleaner smell.  The cajun chips and dip are literally some gigantic dump of dry spices dumpd over tortilla chips and a 2 inch wide 1 inch tall to go cup of sauce.  For $4.00?!?!?! And the drinks are bottles for $2.50. No free refills. The food is served on to go containers with incredibly chincy \"plasticware\" with a tiny TINY napkin.  Just.... no.  Oh my WORD I can't get past this pine cleaner smell as I'm writing this!    No servers; it's self  service.  Be aware before you go in expecting to relax.   The only saving grace is that the red velvet waffle is good.  Just skip the tenders that come with them----dry.   So disappointed after seeing 4.7 stars in reviews."}
{"text":"From humble beginnings as a food truck to now owning a restaurant, I couldn't be more pleased with the staff/owners and the food here. I've never had anything that I haven't liked. Lobster Mac, chicken wings, fish or shrimp..the cucumber pink lemonade is also very delicious. I will be back to the restaurant and still plan on supporting the food truck as well."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with any of the food I've purchased. The food is yummy which means there's great people preparing the food..shout out to the chefs! Lobster  mac and cheese is a winner, order it with anything and thank me later. Their cucumber melon pink lemonade is delicious. You can actually taste the cucumber/melon, you won't regret buying a bottle either. I wish they sold it by the half gallon at least lol. Totally appreciate of the fact they're so convenient to the Whitehall/Steelecreek area when they're over at Xerox. Support local, small businesses whenever I can, they're so worth it and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came to their location last week at prosperity place off of mallard creek. My sister and I ordered Cajun Shrimp and Fries. There was no line, food was cooked in about 15 minutes. We paid $25.00 total for the 2 plates, a bottle of warm water and a pink lemonade which was kinda crazy for food truck food. So I think he should bring his prices down a bit but none the less the food was great! I will be back"}
{"text":"Everything my family ordered was fabulous! Chicken wings,  the red velvet chicken and waffles,  shrimp tacos and the lobster Mac and cheese.  My 10 year old ate all his food and was eating off all of our plates too.  He couldn't decide what he liked the most. Also, the Kumelon lemonade is amazing. We live an hour away and will definitely come back next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Cuzzos is AMAZING! I tried the chicken and red velvet waffles. The waffles weren't too sweet but balanced the crispy chicken well. I had previously been to another waffle place and was dissapointed. But the service was nice and food came out in no time. I fully recommend. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Been eye stalking Cuzzo's for a minute. So being the greedy dude i am.   Today was the day! The location is off of Tuck. Don't let that discourage you cause when i tell u this place has heart. It has heart. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and when i say \"bussing\". It was amazing. Not your traditional Mac, but it was good! I also ordered 10 of the 1/2 jerk 1/2 lemon pepper. They were on point. When your looking for some food with soul. Go check out Cuzzo's. This is now one of my top places and the customer service is top tier. I will be telling my friend to tell a friend because this place is dope. Good food and even better vibes. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Restaurant appeared to be very clean. My husband had the lobster mac and fried shmip. Which he enjoyed a lot.  I had the fish n chip and a side of rice and beans. The portion was very small for the price. I also order a lemonade cucumber juice $3.00. Which I never got. I called in my order so I guess I forgot and so did the lady. Maybe I'll get it next time.  As far as my fish plate it was nothing to write home about. Pretty much basic. I'm sure my husband will visit again."}
{"text":"Good food, good people! I had the peach cobbler waffle and chicken and my homeboy had the red velvet chicken and waffles and we both had the lobster Mac and cheese it was seriously sensational \"in futures voice\""}
{"text":"Tried to call my order in via phone but lady on phone said she wouldn't put my order in unless paid for via phone, I stated I'm paying CASH. Her reply, I have to have phone payment for order....   My portion size didn't satisfy my hunger.   1 & done experience, I will not bring my business back to Cuzzo's, Good luck CC"}
{"text":"This is the best food I've ever had! I've been there for my graduation dinner, birthday dinner, anniversary dinner, and it's satisfied me every time. The lobster mac and cheese is to die for, the wings are amazing, and everything else is unbelievably good, especially the lemonade. Reasonably priced and you definitely get a lot for what you pay. I'll probably never stop coming here, lol."}
{"text":"This place is legit. It's very delicious if you want to try something new. The food can be greasy but don't eat it all the time and you'll be fine. The area is in the ghetto but the restaurant itself is clean inside and very well lit. I wish this place was down south more, uhm Spartanburg / Greenville area. I'll be coming back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about their lobster mac n cheese for a while, and the shrimp looked so good in the pics. I was not disappointed!  Of course this isn't an everyday meal... certainly not cheap or healthy. But I'll absolutely make it a point to go back and try more items next time I visit the Charlotte area.  Or maybe I won't... I mean the mac and shrimp stand on their own."}
{"text":"I am in debt to that yelper who posted a photo of her lunch a few weeks ago, bringing my attention to this new restaurant and prompting a mental note for a future visit.  Decided to take the 20min drive to experience their lauded lobster mac & cheese. Arrived around 11:20am Thursday. Redevelopment is slowly making it's way down Tuckaseegee Rd, yet based on the address, I doubted it had gotten that far down yet. Was looking forward to supporting the organic efforts of a few forward-thinking souls in bringing a fresh new business to this area.  Pulled in to the well maintained parking lot. Walked in to a well-lit and clean restaurant, and was instantly greeted by a young man at the counter. I was the only customer at the time, yet somehow the place still had an energy of fullness and life. After some jovial chatting, decided on a 1/2 lb order.   Taking a seat, the owner came out and greeted me very genuinely, all smiles and warmth. I mentioned I watched a cooking segment of his on TV, and a pleasant conversation proceeded from there. I really hoped the food would be good.  The lobster mac & cheese was indeed good. I should disclose that this was my first time ever having lobster mac & cheese, as I am a devout crab mac & cheese-er. Lobster is so subtly sweet & light tasting that I think it's flavor gets a little lost in a dish like mac & cheese. Thus, I think I arrived with misplaced flavor expectations. Crab mac & cheese comes at you bold; lobster mac & cheese is more discreet & refined. There were lots of chunks of lobster, and it was all marvelously fresh. Totally worth the drive.  For dessert, I had Banana Strawberry Pudding. Growing up, wars of mastery were fought at family reunions over banana pudding, so when the manager praised his version, I had no choice. Sure enough, it was splendid.  Cuzzos Cuisine is a fantastic addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene. Lots of customers piled in after me, and it was clear they have a lot of regulars. Even the local mailman was there. Grateful for it's presence, customer service, and quality of food, and look forward to watching it rise."}
{"text":"New Hot Business Yelp find so I went on my explorer mode to check it out. I understand the 5 star rating.. lobster Mac & Cheese is awesome...nice chunks of lobster w/a balance of cheese & seasonings. I think CLT lacks great Mac & Cheese but this spot gets thumbs up! Fried shrimp was good and they weren't stingy - A plus for real seasoning as well.   Come to this place for good takeout, call in your order or order inside.   Friendly staff, clean establishment and A rating."}
{"text":"Lobster mac taste like government cheese or some other type of cheap overly rich cheese was used. Jerk wings were more teriyaki then jerk had nothing even relatable to jerk. Fried shrimp lacked flavor and very overpriced! Won't be trying them again."}
{"text":"I came here in a group of five. We were able to order and receive our food quickly. Service is good. The crowd comes in swiftly, mostly for takeout. But if you dine in there is nice jazz and a pleasant calm atmosphere. Everything we ordered was delicious! Fish n grits, shrimp n grits, Cajun French fries, lobster mac n cheese, wings, jerk wings, melon drink. Prices are very reasonable, nothing over $11-12. I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Service was delicious. I will be returning very soon. Their lemonade is to die for also."}
{"text":"1st time stopping through while I was in NC and the food was just what I needed to fix the hunger pang. Small venue, but a really good menu of treats. They have a special drink called the KuMelon that is worth a try. Awesome little carry-out and can dine in too if you like spot with friendly, great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm a wing enthusiast and these wings are right up there with the best of them. Super friendly people, quick service, they have it all. Time to start working out again so I can make room for the rest of their amazing looking options."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place. I walked into the restaurant and was immediately greeted by happy staff. I called in my order for a veggie plate and an order of their famous lobster Mac! My order was hot and ready when I arrived. The lobster mac did not disappoint! I look forward to trying their strawberry banana pudding next time."}
{"text":"Easiest way to put this - the food is awesome! The Lobster Mac & Cheese is fab!  I've been here 3 times and have yet to be disappointed. The food is fresh and well, but not overly seasoned. The fish is good, the shrimp is good and the sweet tea will give you a new outlook on life! This is definitely my favorite spot for fried seafood in the Queen City and the added bonus is that Lobster Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"Omgeeee! This lobster Mac is magnificent! Strawberry Banana Pudding is Popping & going down with a Ku'melon! Extremely happy we stumbled across this black owned Gem. Friendly staff great ambiance! I'll definitely be back every time I'm in Charlotte, I love ya'll Support Black Owned Businesses!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the lobster mac was rich but worth every calorie. And the dessert!--I tried the banana pudding and the cinnamon chips. Both were delicious. But best of all were the sweet people who worked there! I'd go back just to feel the love."}
{"text":"Decent. It's hard to get decent food in Charlotte but this place I would revisit. Didn't disappoint, at the end of the day that's all Im looking for."}
{"text":"Cuzzo's was parked right across the street from our hotel the Dunhill.  We we're going somewhere else for lunch and I'm glad we took a chance.  We split the fish, shrimp, and mac & cheese.  All of it was yummy.  The tail- less shrimp made it easy to eat and really tasty tartar sauce.  Job well done chefs!"}
{"text":"So I drive 20 minutes to get this food and it was amazing. I got the 6 wings and 1/2 of lobster Mac with the pink lemonade. The parking was in abundance but I did go around 11:30 so it could get more packed. The wings were good not to saucy and the lobster Mac was good needed a little more lobster but not that much. Definitely going back and you should to. The order lady was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place now for a couple months. Visited on last Thursday (2/9/17) and I was blown away! Myself and a friend were the second and third persons thru the door for lunch. We ordered at counter, both of us selecting the fried shrimp and lobster Mac & cheese. I also ordered the strawberry banana pudding, shared, and a take-out of ten wings, BBQ and jerk. Let me tell u, that lobster Mac&cheese is on point! Super creamy, firm and full of flavor! Yummmmy! The shrimp was fried to perfection and large, plump and delish. The strawberry banana pudding was cold and fresh. Nice spin on the ordinary. The wings were delicious as well, even after reheating at home. The kmelon drink was beyond words!!!. Will go back just for that. The owner actually came out to bring my order to the counter. I shook his hand and congratulated him on his restaurant concept. He was smiling broadly and for a moment I was mesmerized, off my game(Wassup!!). Check out the wall of celebs near the back booths, impressive. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ayyy the food is good cuz what more can you ask for? Hurry and get some, who knows how long itll last for. You can tell it's made with fiery passion. So fiery, it's how the shrimp gets blackened. So far ive been two times, two specials, only 8 bucks, you're crazy if you ignore the cuisine from this great truck!"}
{"text":"I5 dollars for 5 shrimp and a piece of whitie it's a little pricey fish was good but didn't like the tartar or shrimp if getting something you can't go wrong with the chick price is reasonable"}
{"text":"I drove 22min to try this place! The customer service was excellent but sadly the food just wasn't good. I got the fish and lobster Mac. Both were extremely salty.  I couldn't even eat the fish. I finished maybe a quarter of the lobster Mac just off of the principle that I had just spent $17 on this meal (I got fries and a drink too)! I really wanted this place to be great, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"I normally stalk the food truck when they have shrimp and grits so I went to try them at the new restaurant.  Just as good with friendly service aa well.  We tried the wings, empanadas. Lobster man and cheese and of course my shrimp and grits. Everything hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried fish and lobster mac and cheese for takeout. The fish was good, could use more seasoning though. The mac and cheese was creamy. Decent customer service. I  would return."}
{"text":"Came here with a few family members and my toddler. Upon walking in there were a good amount of people either waiting to order or waiting for their food. Understandable. However, the guy at the register was moving slower than molasses. I think we waited at least 10 min just to order, and another 20 min for our order. The young lady who brought our food out wasn't personable. The food was yummy. It was a bit hard to enjoy it fully with a toddler and no high chair or booster. The cucumber lemonade was delicious.   *I will change my stars after waiting a good bit before returning for a chance to work of the kinks."}
{"text":"I have experienced the gastronomic explosion in my mouth through cuzzos food truck, when they were at the Southend Food Truck rally. I'm thrilled they have their own location now!  The flavor packed into each bite is sublime!  Highly recommended their catering services as well as their new space!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Lobster Mac and cheese will literally be the death of me. Sunday's are packed out because people know the foods good and you get big portions sizes. Support black business!"}
{"text":"This is exactly not what I expected.   Upon arrival I was impressed by how clean the location was. How friendly everybody was with not only me. Those coming in and after me. Each guest was made to feel welcome.   Let's talk about the food: I had the Lobster Mac and cheese. It's truly amazing. I had a order of classic Hot wings with the sauce on the side. Let's just say I wanted more sauce. This place is amazing and can take all my monies."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean up one entrance..  Greeted by Chef and his Son.  Menu was easy and looked great.  Food came out in no time. Everything was very tasty.  Will definitely refer others and return in the very near future."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while, stalking the lobster Mac and cheese pics just waiting for the convenient time to make my move. Finally, things got slow at work and I fought my way through the cat calls to the safety of their four walls.   \"Welcome to cuzzos\" the cashier said as I walked through the door. My eyes were big and my stomach was ready, shrimp, wings, tenders, lobster Mac and cheese... I wanted it all! But I had talk myself down, I have a waistline and a wallet to be considerate of. So, I chose the lobster Mac and cheese and tenders.    They are not very fast and to be honest, my portion was a little smaller than I anticipated. The tenders were kinda skimpy but they tasted good. The Mac and cheese was everything I could have hoped for and the lobster isn't \"too much\" but nicely added in there.   You can add a sauce to your tenders, the bbq looks like mild but it tastes good. There's room to eat in here but most people were taking their food to go. It comes in little black containers that can be reused to that's useful. I'll definitely be back to explore more menu options.  Oh, they offer 10% off for students!"}
{"text":"My daughter requested soul food so we made the drove over and were not disappointed! Everything was fresh,  seasoned to perfection and customer service was great.  Ill certainly be back on another cheat day!"}
{"text":"Food was really good! We got the lobster Mac and fish dinner and the fish and shrimp combo. Everything was really good. The only complaint would be the wait time."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday to try the buffet and omg! Everything was delicious! The collard greens and lobster Mac are probably my favs. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I must say, these guy's live up to all the hype! The food was very good. We had fish tacos / lobster mac n cheese \" the chocolate & strawberry \" dessert , french fries & the cucumber pink lemonade. ...I can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu.  #Satisfied"}
{"text":"What a hidden jewel in Charlotte. The red velvet waffles are better and cheaper than Terrace Cafe. So flavorful and moist! The lobster mac and cheese is remarkable. Will definitely add this to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"So I'll start out by saying, I was a little skeptical of coming here after hearing a number of mixed reviews. I work literally 3mins down the street, but was too nervous to try it, until recently!! I decided to try it and was PLEASANTLY surprised!! I walked in around 12noon and noticed that the music was a little loud for a lunchtime crowd, more fitting for a party atmosphere. People were yelling over the music to place their order and talk to each other as they ate. I would suggest turning the music down a smidge, to create more of a pleasurable experience for guests. I was greeted by the staff and they were very friendly and helpful, as I had no clue what I was in the mood for! I ordered the fried shrimp and lobster Mac n cheese, along with a Kumelon (cucumber melon pink lemonade). My food came out within about 10 mins and I headed back to work. When I got back, I was blown away by the flavor!! I was told that the lobster Mac n cheese lacked the lobster but this wasn't the case for me! I had the perfect lobster/mac ratio! The shrimp was fried to perfection and the portion was excellent! I would definitely recommend it!!  During my second visit, they were running a special and I ordered the lemon pepper wings, lobster Mac n cheese, and cinnamon chips for $10. I ordered my lunch over the phone before heading to work and was 15mins away when I placed my ordered. When I got there, I still had to wait another 15 mins before my food was ready but the staff was very apologetic about the long wait and offered a free drink because of the inconvenience. I would encourage everyone to try it for yourself!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG. OMG. The best food. Lobster macncheese to knock your socks off. Great BBQ wings as well. Yeap I will be looking and following for sure."}
{"text":"Great Mac n cheese had the potato and corn chowder, yummy and kids keep asking to go back"}
{"text":"We ended up coming here after seeing their yelp reviews and boy were we happy!! When we went in the employees were extremely friendly and explained the menu/specials to us. We were a little indecisive and they were so nice and helpful. We both ordered the chicken and waffles and I got a tea as well. The wait for our was about 25 minutes but it was so worth it!   I was a little nervous about the cream cheese drizzle on top of the red velvet waffle but it was my favorite part and the best red velvet waffle I have ever had. The chicken wings are amazing!! The seasoning is LIT I literally ate every crumb all the way down to the gristle lol. I will definitely back--probably next weekend."}
{"text":"Visited the food truck on business parking lot ,as the restaurant had a 30 min wait.  I have seen photos online for months and finally was able to visit. The  lobster Mac and cheese was good.  Fried shrimp and chicken tenders were ok, and fries too salty.  Kids enjoyed all 3.  Looking forward to visiting Sunday buffet to sample more options"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint! Have tried the hot wings, lobster Mac & cheese, and fried shrimp. All really, really good. The employees are also very friendly. They're a little pricey, but honestly the quality is so worth it. Next time I am definitely going to try their red velvet waffles and shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.... what's not to love? I've gotten takeout here twice and both times, I was greeted warmly. The first time, I ordered fish and lobster mac & cheese. THE best lobster mac I have ever had. I was most impressed because it took no time for them to fix my order. Considering it was fish, I assumed it must've been premade and sitting under a heat lamp. I expected for it to be Luke warm. I was Wrong. After driving to Target, I opened my container and everything was Hot and fresh. Very impressed! Then there was the mac and cheese. It was creamy, flavorful, and there I was scarfing down a whole meal in a parking lot. There were several chunks of lobster meat. At the price point, I'm not sure how they do it. I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.  I came back about a week later and the cook/owner wasn't there. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but my lemon pepper wings were great AND they had 3 drums/ 3 flats. Management assured me they're addressing consistency w/ m&c. Not sure if they take special request with wings, but I'm cool with it being even.  Needless to say, I'll be driving across town to return to Cuzzo's to get the mac and cheese. I'm rooting for them to open a second location sooner than later."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I was greeted individually by this nice lady at the front .. she had such a welcoming spirit. Neo-soul and Jazz music played in the back ground.. (my type of music). A quiet atmosphere. I started to browse the menu and the same lady that greeted me helped me order. She explained the menu and educated me on what I should get since I was a first timer. I chose the shrimp and fish with lobster mac. Also ordered the kumelon drink. She also explained the point system to me for every dollar I spend I get a point .. the points add up and you can get 10% off . Good to know because I plan on coming back. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are good. Next time I will not be coming alone . Definitely will be bringing a crowd of people next time around . Food was A1.  #supportingBlackBusinesses #greatFood  #evenBetterPeople."}
{"text":"After Yelp stalking this place for about a year or so, I FINALLY was in the area at the right time to give this place a try. First I'll start with the good: The staff were very personable and helpful. They were friendly and appeared as if they enjoyed being there. The lobster mac... wow.... the lobster mac. Never had it before, but I need more of it in my life.  The bad: The area where I was sitting seemed a bit cramped. It wasn't a deal breaker, but I was almost tempted to eat in my car. The chicken wings were fried hard. I know there are some people that like that (for some reason), however I am not one of them. Tender and flavorful is the name of the game for me when it comes to wings. Because of the texture of the wings, I could not enjoy them. They were edible, but I ate them because I paid for them.   Either way, it was a pretty good first visit. I probably wont get the wings again but the menu was full of other things I'm curious to try. But I WILL be getting more of the lobster mac, that pretty much goes without saying. If you're in the area, check them out."}
{"text":"Recently got lunch to go here and it was so good! I ordered the chicken with a side of lobster mac and cheese. The chicken was good and I liked the bbq sauce. The star of the show was definitely the mac and cheese. I made sure to grab salt and pepper on my way out thinking I would need it for the mac and cheese. Nope! It was perfect! Also, there was ton of lobster in the mac and cheese. It was definitely worth me taking some lactaid!   The two friendly women at the register were kind and welcoming to me and everyone else who entered. Between the food and the great customer service, I say this spot is a win!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant that started from a Food truck! Awesome lobster Mac and wings.   Now I can get the food without traveling around the city chasing his truck!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  I have been to the truck multiple times and love the food.  Just wish they would visit south Charlotte more."}
{"text":"So this ended up being a pleasant surprise I ordered the wings lemon pepper wings with the lobster mac & cheese and the red velvet waffle all of them were amazing the taste was excellent it was well prepared it was fresh it was hot this restaurant is amazing it is a small little establishment but it is well worth The trip."}
{"text":"Now I have tried a few items from Cuzzo's - shrimp tacos, lobster mac & cheese, fish & fries, wings (lemon pepper & regular) and they were all delicious. But - I just tried the Red Velvet waffle & chicken - oh my goodness, I'm mad I'm at work and can't eat the way I want to. . Absolutely scrumptious!!!!! You don't even need syrup, the icing drizzle is enough. Please visit their food truck if you see it  - YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!"}
{"text":"OmG...this was my first time eating here and this place is the best soul food restaurant that I can honestly say that it so close to my cooking. (Maybe better because I can cook...lol) but everything was soooo good and the owner and the staff were so professional and very nice. I will be back soon!!!"}

{"text":"3rd time and once again I'm satisfied. Lets break down this go 'round Food: the lobster Mac and cheese NEVER disappoints. Very flavorful and a fair portion for the price. The fish tacos hurt my feelings. They just didn't hit. Maybe I'm used to local favorites like cabo fish taco or Pinkys fish tacos. They were just....bland. Like a giant fish stick on a tortilla (I'm sorry). Thank goodness for that cilantro, it helps. Maybe another smudge of the sauce or even a course slaw would make it perfect. However, the rest of the food was so good that I'm still gonna return!  Customer service: VERY PLEASANT. Felt like I was among family Ambiance: kinda absent but the vibe is still pleasantly relaxing with upbeat jazz playing in the background. Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is a small, local business that I can say I'm glad to support. This restaurant is in the middle of a lower middle to low income area that is getting closer and closer to gentrification daily (think NoDa) so I hope they stick around. Parking is directly in front of the restaurant and wasn't a hassle. There is also plenty of space inside to eat.   I ordered Cajun wings with a side of their famous lobster macaroni and cheese. While the wait time was longer than I wanted, my food was HOT. The wings were really good, fried perfectly! The lobster mac was good. It was well seasoned and was a good portion.   Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and great food. Definitely a great addition to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This truck served some of the best chicken tenders I have ever eaten. Tender juicy meat with delicious breading. You can tell they are made from scratch. So good! I ordered the lobster Mac & cheese for my kids, but ended up eating it myself. I usually do not like lobster, but this dish was delish. Mac & cheese with a kick and a twist. It had some heat and a lot of flavor.   This truck serves filling comfort food that makes you happy to be eating. I wish I had room in my belly for the chicken and red velvet waffle that was on the menu. Next time!  The truck was in Matthews for an outdoor Charlotte Symphony concert."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Cuzzo's food and was so glad to find that they opened a sit down location closeby. The bf and I walked in an hour before closing, wish they opened closer to Uptown...not a fan of the location, a little dark and shady. I recommend CALLing IN AHEAD FOR PICK UP, we waited for a while for the food to be done. The staff was nice but, the wait for the food was not. We ordered a 1/2 lobster mac, chicken and the red velvet waffle, and a side of seasoned fries. The food was delicious! That lobster mac was so creamy, seasoned, and laden generously with juicy lobster bits. My favorite, I could eat a whole order by myself I bet...your calorie counting body will not thank you but, your taste buds sure will. The seasoned fries were crunchy but, a little dry. My bf scarfed his chicken and waffles down, The waffle was nice and fluffy, and spot on with the red velvet taste. The chicken tenders with cajun dry rub were a little on the chewy side but, still tasted good.   I'd definitely come back here, but will be calling ahead for pickup. You will be waiting there for your food for a very long time if not."}
{"text":"This food truck is parked in front of the Gateway Village are on Trade every Wednesday. I ordered a cucumber melon pink lemonade, $3 is very refreshing but also sweet. I also ordered a half size lobster Mac and cheese, $5. I was excited for the sauce and size from the last Yelp pics posted. Sadly, it was much smaller, clumpier, and drier than I expected. Flavor and seasoning were very good though, had a nice kick of Cajun spice to it. I wish they gave more sauce and pasta! Would try one more time just to test consistency."}
{"text":"The staff is warm and friendly. The food is made fresh to order. You can also call ahead if you don't want to wait. I got the fish and Lobster Mac N Cheese. It was very good and flavorful. I definitely would go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Thats all i can say. I hope they serve every meal juat as freah and good as mine was."}
{"text":"I love there fish Tacos they are amazing . I been trying to duplicate at home and it's not working out so I definitely will be back soon."}
