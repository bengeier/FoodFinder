{"text":"Great place amazing service, the staff is on point in all aspects. Ask for \"Augi \" he's the best!!!"}
{"text":"Cozumel is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to, hands down (and trust me I am a connoisseur  of mexican food!). My husband and I have been coming here regularly for the past three years and every time the food and service is great. The chips are always warm, the salsa is always fresh, and the guacamole and queso are also good as appetizers. The wait staff are always really friendly and all of them know who we are and come to say hi when we stop in. If you need anything, you can just ask any of the servers and they will gladly help you. We love Cozumel so much that we actually had our rehearsal dinner here!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the other Cozumels, my wife and I were in Lakewood for a play at the Beck Center and decided to try the Lakewood restaurant because of its location.  To our surprise the food, the margaritas and especially the service (thank you JUAN) were excellent!  Even obliged us by going off menu and frying up some jalapeno peppers.  Highly recommend you g
ive this restaurant a try and if you remember ask for one of Juan's tables."}
{"text":"We just love it here~Been coming since day one and every week we look forward to our next time there~Ramon has the best everything~"}
{"text":"This is not your average Mexican. The food here is a few notches above every other Mexican I have had in the area. Their salsa is really good. My favorites are the burrito de La roquetta and  carnitas chimichangas."}
{"text":"I have tried several mexican places in this region, and Cozumel is definitely the best, No doubt!  The food is always great, the kitchen staff are FAST, and the prices are very reasonable!   ...I especially recommend the Carnitas dinner!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great chips and salsa on the table as you sit down.  Service was impeccable... felt like I was in Puerto Vallarta.  The fajitas were excellent."}
{"text":"I can't say I share the love for this place. It wasn't the worst but it was by far no where near the best.  For me, it's on the lower end of typical Americanized Mexican food. 
I was looking for something meatless, but when I asked the waitress about their vegetarian options she really didn't have any suggestions for me.  So I went with a bean burrito.
And that is exactly what I got. It was a plain bean burrito with runny, salty beans and some sauce on top, with rice served on the side.  The combo came with a quesadilla and again just  totally plain.  A hunk of bland white cheese in between a tortilla.  It wasn't hot so it was chewy.  
The other people in my party seemed to fair better. Their items came with rice, beans, lettuce tomato sour cream guacamole etc.  Same opinion as to quality and taste, not the worst but not great either.  
In regards to service, it was ok start to finish.  The hostess was friendly and greeted us upon entering. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was nice, if not somewhat absent, as was the guy who we paid at the end. The restaurant itself was colorful and everyone there seemed happy.  The place was really loud. They definitely try to maximize the seating.  Overall it was ok, but I can't say I'd go back.  There are so many better options out there."}
{"text":"I love this place, the employees are kind, the food is great, the atmosphere is fantastic, and it's clean which is a big deal for me. I recommend it. I'm sure it'll be a hit with the whole family."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks and service. I travel so much for work and this is the best Mexican good I've had. Drinks are good as well, I like the \"natural margarita\" you can't go wrong and won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Wow, I recently moved to Lakewood and really loved the food here. I think I found a new favorite place. The food and service were great and everything was very clean.

I visited here on a Saturday night while they were busy. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and seated. I had barely sat down when someone brought Chips and Salsa. One of the reasons I had decided to eat out was I was having a craving for Chips and Salsa. These chips really fulfilled my craving. The chips were warm and the salsa tasted so good I nearly ate all the salsa by my self which I never do. Then they brought the Salsa Verde Enchiladas which I ordered. Everything on the plate was piping hot and tasted delicious. The enchiladas tasted wonderful and the chicken was fresh and juicy. Even the rice and beans were great. The wait staff was on the ball, checking to see if my food was ok, and refilling my drink as often as needed.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Five stars for cheap \"Mexican\" food. Service is amazing. I've never had anything but stellar service. The food is cheap and pretty good. One of my favorite \"I'm Not In The Mood To Cook Dinner Tonight\" places to go."}
{"text":"Last week, the wife and I were craving Mexican food.  We immediately thought of Cozumel in Independence.  Historically, their food has been tasty, with decent service, and very affordable prices.  As several others have mentioned, the parking situation at the restaurant is absolutely  ridiculous!  There are very few spaces at Cozumel, especially around the dinner rush.  However, they do offer \"free valet\" parking.  Meanwhile the dumpy hotel next door has all kinds of empty parking spaces but restaurant patrons are not allowed to park there - unless you wish to get towed.  For some reason, I cant get my head around valet parking at Mexican Cantina style restaurant.  I also considered parking across the street, and risking my life simulating the Frogger game trying to cross route 21 - but then came to my senses...and just decided to go somewhere else.   We had a nice meal at Aladdin's (Greek) just down the street.  Until they fix the parking situation, my family is DONE with Cozumel...it's just not worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever...... Went there for lunch ordered fish tacos, they brought me tacos with what appeared to be Van De Kamps fish fillets inside!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is delicious and the service is fast and friendly.  Great margaritas specials. I highly recommend the mango one."}
{"text":"I feel a little awkward giving this review since other yelpers seem to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, but I think the people need to know.

PROs: Very clean and the staff is friendly and eager to please. The prices are reasonable. These things are very important to me so it pushes the rating up.

CONs: The food isn't bad per se but it is just average. I've had a few dishes here and everything is, well, bland.  I don't mean \"not spicy\" - I mean no real flavor. In the world of Tex Mex, this is an unpardonable sin."}
{"text":"I was supposed to have a date at this Cozumel tonight, but I was stood up/ghosted, so I ordered food to go. On the way home, my car broke down. While I was waiting for the tow truck, I discovered that the Cozumel staff had given me lots of chips and salsa, as well as some other dips free of charge. 

The food at Cozumel is always delicious, and I really appreciated the staff's quiet compassion on this very difficult day. Thank you, guys. I assure you that I'll be back, and that I'll always recommend you to others."}
{"text":"Cozumel is your typical Midwest interpretation of Mexican food. I really only go for their margaritas, which are very boozy and feature new flavors often. They have all the standard fare: quesadillas, burrito plates, tacos, nothing new or daring here. But what exactly do you want? If you want a loud, family friendly restaurant that keeps the chips coming, and offers tasty standard fare, there's not too much to complain about. I've never driven by on a weekend or even weekend night and not seen them busy. Waiters are always running around busting their asses but are friendly enough. Overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been a returning customer for some time now that I live in the area. The servers and host are always very pleasant and accommodating. I ordered online for cinco de mayo (sorry for that lol), and even though they were packed out the door the nicest host handling take out orders and payments of the tables was able to get my food order correct and fast. Everyone there values you as a customer. The food and margaritas have always been great as well. Highly recommend if you are looking for laid back, great tasting, traditional American Mexican food."}
{"text":"I feel it has the best Mexican food in the area. The service is excellent. My favorite thing on the menu is the Chicken Taco Salad. It is really reasonably priced. Totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"L over the service for die-hard and carryout.  My favorite dish is the Fajita Grande."}
{"text":"Love this place! This place is always jammed packed doesn't matter what time of day it is! We love to get take out from here, always fast friendly service!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years..one of my husbands favorite places....we are vegetarian and order off of the vegetarian menu...to our surprise...we asked for some vegetarian rice to go....they said well it's not vegetarian...we cook it with chicken...it's been on the vegetarian menu for years???   I don't trust that the rest of the food on the vegetarian menu is vegetarian...they apparently don't know what that means...so we willl never be back again....we were duped....they should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"great service...great food...great margiritas!!! Need i say more."}
{"text":"The prices are great... for very Americanized Mexican.  You are not going to get very authentic Mexican food, so if you are looking for that, I would try some place else (and skip the rest of this review).

This place seems to serve up very straight forward americanized Mexican, and they do it well.  Four stars for what it is to me, basic mexican (I would probably drop a star for authenticity if that's what I was expecting from this joint).   The service is frighting fast. The quality of what they make is great and delivered to you hot and with good presentation.  The place is clean and very comfortable.  Prices are very fair.  We take our kids here a lot and they love it.  When your kids comment how quick and friendly the service is, you know they are doing a good job."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, listen to your waitress and don't share the half pitcher of margaritas unless you are sharing with someone who drinks their share, because it's a lot .  We ordered  two seafood fajitas  and they were fresh and delicious   Our waitress was Karina has our vote....always listen to her."}
{"text":"Not an ideal experience here a few weeks ago.

Was spectating at a crossfit event across the street, and during the intermission my friends and I wanted to escape the sauna created by athletes pumping and grunting for hours. We headed over to Cozumel for a breath of fresh air. 

My friends ordered some margs, and I just ordered a light meal: \"guacamole salad\" and small cheese quesadilla. You can't mess up a quesadilla with just cheese, so that was most excellent. I was told the margs tasted like nail polish remover - YUM!

The guacamole salad was some watery (likely out of a pouch) guacamole and some watery lettuce. DO NOT order this. Biggest rip off of the century. It was $3.25 on the menu, which was reasonable, but the quality is sub-par so just keep your three dollars.

When I got my bill, I noticed my \"guacamole salad\" was over $5! WHAT! I could buy all the ingredients for an entire batch for that much, AND the menu said $3.25. My friends also had a bunch of price mix-ups. 

We go to pay...and the cashier is yapping away on her personal cell phone and is very slow to take care of our group of six. We complain about the prices and she says the prices have changed. They didn't update the menu, but tried to pull a fast one. A few extra bucks here and there will add up. Luckily they corrected this.

This place is a rip-off. The food is not very good, so just cook some quesadillas at home."}
{"text":"You don't need to get on a plane to spend an evening in Cozumel! Instead, all you need to do is drive to Lakewood, Ohio. As the sitting Duke of Cozumel I can confidently proclaim that it is the finest Mexican restaurant in the greater Cleveland area. Warm tortilla chips with fresh house made salsa are provided before your behind touches the seat. The queso, a Cozumel staple, is simple yet bursting with flavor. I usually make a power play and order the taco platter which includes three delicious tacos accompanied by authentic Mexican rice and refried beans, however, Cozumel's creative and innovative executive chef has crafted an exclusive entrée that has caused me to reconsider everything that I know in this world. The entrée, called a quesadilla fajita, is a modern twist on two old Mexican classics and has quickly become my go-to. The servers at Cozumel are attentive, helpful and friendly and the prices are just right. The ambiance is casual and upbeat and it even has a bar area with a TV in case \"the game\" is on and you start craving the best Mexican food in greater Cleveland. Parking is plentiful and the space is always very clean. Overall, Cozumel is a fantastic place to enjoy delicious Mexican food and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fast ,Friendly, good Mexican food.  Always fell welcome."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here the food is good , fast and affordable. Staff is always polite and service is fast."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this establishment. The service is incredibly fast and efficient. The food is deliscious, prepared quickly and fresh. The prices are reasonable taking into consideration todays inflation. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food! I had the fajita quesadilla and it was DELICIOUS! My hubby ate mahi fish tacos and they were superb. They have great flavor and everything tasted so fresh! We were seated immediately, our drinks came out fast, and so did our food. Prices are fair, and the restaurant was very clean- which is so nice to see."}
{"text":"Fabulous service! So enthusiastic and efficient. The best Mexican food this side of Cleveland. I go to school out of state but always make time to come here when I'm home. Order anything on the menu you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming. The salsa tasted like it was a bit watered down with pizza sauce. Margs were not great. Taco salad was extra medium. Aesthetically this place looks like a Dennys. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great patio for some chips and queso (you have to order the cheese dip, it's amazing!) and a margarita or a daiquiri. I ordered the Enchiladas Super Rancheros ($10.50) which gives you a variety of enchiladas to try, which I love. I wish it came with rice and beans, but you could always order it separately. A medium daiquiri/margarita which is a normal sized glass and also the smallest size you can order is $5.25. Ask about their special flavors, today was guava. FYI, they do allow people to smoke on their patio, so if this is a concern for you, just get a table inside."}
{"text":"Fast service, as soon as you sit down they bring you chips & salsa! 
Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"I visited this location with a large group of co-workers not expecting it to be that good.  I was impressed with the service, taste, and portion.  Ordered chicken quesadilla and it was really good.  Their chips and salsa were very tasty.  I loved that habanero sauce was available if you wanted to turn it up a notch.  The service was excellent for our large group. Very fast food prep too!  This Cozumel location makes me want to visit one nearby to my house.  I will definitely be taking my family to Cozumels in the future!  Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I went, my partner and I were not huge fans. It was cheap, pretty standard Americanized Mexican food. Unfortunately, it was a bit on the mediocre side, so we decided we would not choose to go there again. My dad wanted to meet there recently, though, so my partner and I went again. I ordered the special Burrito a la Diablo, which had chorizo with chicken in a burrito with some spiced sauce; it came with a side of pinto beans and rice. The beans tastes slimy, so I had a suspicion something was wrong with them. I ate a few more bites and then couldn't finish them. I ate hardly any of the rice. The following night, I had HORRIBLE food poisoning. More than the horrible digestive symptoms, I felt achy and dizzy like if I had the flu. At one point, I was so weak that I thought vomiting would make me pass out.

I will never ever go here again. For those of you who had good experiences, I'm glad you were lucky. I wouldn't recommend taking any more chances with this place, though."}
{"text":"As have many Western Lakewood residents, we've witnessed the rise (literal) and fall (figurative) of the IHOP in our neighborhood. It was built brand-new and lasted for only a short time and then sat vacant for quite some time. I wondered what ill-fated follow-up would take over the space as it sat empty. Well, I've been proved wrong on that, as Cozumel Mexican Restaurant was the perfect choice for the building and the neighborhood. 

We've been patrons of the Luchita's on W. 117th for many years and, more recently, of El Jalapeno's (also on 117th) but now with Cozumel within walking distance, I think that it will the go-to place to take care of our Mexican fix. 

Overall, the server was friendly, the food was really good, the Margarita was strong and the beer was cold. They did a nice job of transforming the IHOP into a stylish, casual restaurant devoid of sombreros and velvet paintings. My only real complaint is that we were seated at a small 2 top with a lovely view of the server station and the bathrooms when there were plenty of booths available. 

I had the Carnitas and my wife had the Chimichanga combo and both were flavorful, hot and of quality ingredients. The food came out very quickly and the whole bill for 2 with drinks, entrees and tip was well under $40. If you are a Lakewood resident, make sure you check out this new community amenity."}
{"text":"Below standard! All the food was bland and service was just as disappointing. We sat for several minutes without even getting our drink order in. The chile releno was a disappointment. The breading was just totally mushy and disgusting. I had high hopes but I think I'll stick to El Jalapenos down the street!"}
{"text":"This place is just kind of weird! Our food was either goopy or watery. It tasted kind of strange. Definitely not a Cleveland treasure."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! First time eating at a COZUMELs and it was delicious Mexican food. Great Chips and Salsa. the Chicken tortilla soup was very tasty and the mixed Fajitas were some of the best we've ever had! Staff is also very friendly and service was so quick! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the area. Staff is friendly. Service is very fast. Parking can be kind of a haste but trust me it's worth it. Highly recommend getting \"the el duo\""}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I've found in the Cleveland area.  The prices are reasonable, the service is prompt, and the food is consistently delicious and ready quickly.  You'll never go home hungry either!  I highly recommend Cozumel's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice atmosphere, awesome service! Fun place to go as a family! Keep up the great work Cozumel!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times, and never left upset.  The food is good and the service is always great.  The chips and salsa you get for free are wonderful. I usually go with one of the combo meals, but they have a wide range of Mexican fare."}
{"text":"One thing that Cleveland lacks is good Mexican food.  Cozumels is an exception.  They did a great job with this building and they keep it very clean.  While waiting for a table I watched a worker clean every inch of the booths, tables, windows, ect.  It is a good feeling showing they care.  The food was great for the price and we enjoyed our time there.  Will go back in the future!"}
{"text":"Looks like they delete bad but true reviews!!  So posting again...I will never eat at this place again!  We ordered take out. I had the taco salad. I was shocked to find a live COCK ROACH crawling put of it!  DISGUSTING!  We immediately threw our entire dinners in a garbage bag and got them the heck out of the house!  When we called to complain they offered us a free meal on our next visit...really?!?!  Don't think we will ever be going back there!  Finally they refunded our money but didn't really care they are serving roaches in there dinners!  I am still in shock over this!!  And this was such a good place to get authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our meal - first time here and we really enjoyed it! Veggie tacos and enchiladas verde and pollo loco were outstanding! The server was pleasant and fast. Everyone was very friendly. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" restaurant when we want to go out for a quick meal.  The waiters are consistently fast and friendly and the food is consistently good.  I have never been disappointed with a trip to Cozumel."}
{"text":"My best friend and I frequent here often and love the staff and the food! Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim after a 10-mile bike ride on the Towpath. We were seated promptly and our server was attentive. The chips came out warm and the salsa was quite good, but the guacamole was just ok, a little runny and bland for my taste. Luckily, things looked up when our entrees arrived. I had the seafood chimichanga and it was awesome! Despite it being called seafood, it only had grilled shrimp which was fine with me. And no beans inside... Score! The chimichanga was fried to perfection, crunchy, not soggy. My husband's pollo loco was also delicious! Very moist and flavorful, and again, no nasty refried beans taking up half the plate, it was served with rice and salad and guac. The kids' meals were also very generous portions and they let my picky eater make some substitutions at no charge. They were thrilled. Overall, if it weren't for the mediocre guac, I would have given this place a 4.5. We really enjoyed our entrees a lot!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious Americanized Mexican food. My 6 year old loves it and so do I. Service is super quick. I recommend the mango margarita."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Brunswick and in the Cleveland area. The rice is amazing and the fajitas are very fresh and generous in size. The ground beef tacos are my favorite. Salsa and chips are very flavorful and well done. Super friendly staff, very fast service. I come here all the time even when I moved from ohio I'd still eat here on visits. Lunch time you can get in and out quick."}
{"text":"Very good selection of Mexican beers, and service. The food it's decent I had the flautas good. and also the quesadilla it's good I will try this place again Ithe prices are reasonable the service like I said it's good. Ask for the spicy salsas! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior dissuade you. The food was good. The service was attentive and prompt. 

We ordered a bowl of soup with some extra broth on the side to bring home to my mother, who had a bad cold. They gave us the soup, extra broth, a big bag of their delicious chips, and a cup of salsa. Very nice."}
{"text":"Fresh chips (that were still warm) and salsa (yum). My #7 fajita was still sizzling when it was brought out to me. The flavors blended well together. Best Mexican I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"We've been slaves to Cozumel's fabulous Mexican kitchen for years and used to drive to Broadview Heights from the East Side to get it.  Thankfully, a few years ago, a Cozumel branch opened off I-480 and Transportation Boulevard - whew!  Our favorites are Pollo Con Crema and Chory Pollo - fresh chicken exquisitely prepared.  Fabulous, fresh chips and amazing salsa.  The prices for margaritas are half of what you'd pay at Momocho or Lopez on Lee Road, and you can't beat the friendly and efficient service.  The place is clean and always packed.  You can tell the owners take pride in their place and their product."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, consistent food and friendly staff. They sell Mexican Coke which I love..."}
{"text":"I'm gonna write this review in real time.  As we enter a mariachi cover of Down on the Corner by Creedence is jamming on the sound system, hell yeah.  Chips came out quick, they are warm and salsa is spicy.  Friendly server just set down delicious queso dip, so creamy mmmm.  Wife is remarking about how clean and nice the restaurant is.   Waiter's faux hawk is lookin tight.  Wife's food came out first but that's ok because she gets crabby when hungry.  Food is here and portions are enormous.  Too bad no lunch menu on Sunday but I guess we will have some leftovers for tomorrow.  Wife doesn't seem to be complaining about the deliciousness of her steak fajitas.  I'm enjoying my chalupa and enchilada but my head is sweating after i slathered them in that nuclear green El Yucateco sauce.  Mmm yeah it's good though.  Omg I am so stuffed."}
{"text":"Cozumel is a hidden gem in Cleveland. Their service and cleanliness is impeccable! Their food is served hot and quickly. My one and only complaint might be the lack of heat in the food. However, you can request more, if you'd like. I won't go ANYwhere else for Mexican. I even spotted a woman washing each and every page of their menus. Where have you ever seen that? If you haven't been here, you should go."}
{"text":"Ate there for the second time yesterday. Each time it was with a group, this time with 14 others. Staff handled our orders professionally and without any problems both times.

First thing I want to say is how fantastic their salsa is. Everyone gets their own small dish so they can add any amount of heat from the bottles of hot sauce on the tables, or double-dip all they want. If you run low they happily refill. And if you ask, they have a wonderful special hot sauce that really sneaks up on you. If it wasn't for the food, I could munch on their chips and salsa all day.

I have not had a bad meal at Cozumel. There were no complaints from anyone else in my group, on either visit, so that constitutes probably over 30 meals without a problem. One person I noticed actually ordered two meals so they could take one home for the next day.

Margaritas are good. Strong. Tastey. Check for the \"Special of the Month\" at the entrance.

I plan to return."}
{"text":"I've been to Cozumel before, in Independence, a number of times, and I think they are one of the best Mexican Restaurants in the area. So, going to the one in Brunswick, my expectations were high. I gladly proclaim the Brunswick location to be the equal of the Independence location. Actually, I think it's even better.

The staff was very friendly. The food was delicious. Salsa is fantastic. Absolutely Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. While the margarita, salsa and chips were good the entrees were mediocre at best. The food came out with 5 minutes which tells me right away that it something is up.  My hubby got the chimichangas. They were ok, but not fried or crispy at all. I got the Chile Rellenos and they were inedible - soggy and not crisp. The chilies tasted like they were from a can, not fresh. The breading was thin and soft. I think both entrees were frozen/refrigerated then microwaved. 

Unfortunately I won't be back. Having lived for over 20 years in California I know what \"authentic\" is and this is not it."}
{"text":"Wow, deliciosa! We came on a Saturday night, expecting \"run of the mill\" Mexican and the menu confirmed; but when the food arrived, yummy! The salsa and chips were perfect and our dishes, the chicken burrito grande (filled with fresh , tender chicken and crispy sauteed veggies) and the fajita (again, fresh tender chicken, crispy sauteed veggies, a tantilizing creamy sauce and crispy grilled tortilla) were the BOMB!!! Considering that it is in the neighborhood and the bill was under $20 bucks, we will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Great basic Mexican fare and wonderful service. The guy at the counter who takes the carry out orders is especially great. Love the taco salad and the burritos. Always a staple in our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Chips, salsa, cheese were good, taco was greasy and tasted like Taco Bell, enchilada was nothing to write home about, tostada was mushy from all the grease, cheese quesadilla wasn't bad but nothing I would get again, server seemed very angry, and just threw everything on table, not a good experience all around"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore the Carne Asada and Pollo Loco. All of the food is amazing, but those are my favorites. Get the queso dip while you wait - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has phenomenal chimichangas, my preference is the beef. I also would recommend the strawberry fried ice cream. DELICIOUS!!!! My only complaint would be more parking space, as well as more space needed inside. It gets so busy that standing room at the front register is too congested for customers dining in or out."}
{"text":"I go there very often. I find the service next to perfect. Have a wide range of foods and plates. Has a very good atmosphere to it and is a good place to take the family."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre place. The salsa was very mild - not spicy. Chips were cold. Service was lackluster..they made a mistake on the drink order but quickly remedied it. Margaritas were weak - I wouldn't recommend them. Wine selection not impressive (but not surprising given the restaurant.)

The food was pretty decent, though. I got the supreme burrito and my mom got the chicken quesadillas. Had leftovers. No complaints there.

Price not very expensive. Ambiance was very loud - typical family mexican resturant.

I wouldn't go back..I'd rather try other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've been wanting a Taco Salad for a while. My Co workers suggested this place.  The taco salad shell was soggy.  It looked as though they didn't drain the ground beef.  The meat had no flavor and my enchiladas were cold. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"1st time here. Liked my big burrito,a mix of chix/groundbeef. They had fresh jalapenos which they chopped up & sprinkled over my burrito. Really added some heat to it ! Not liking the rice & beans , both rather bland . Chips were fresh but not a fan of this style of salsa. It's like Nuevo Acapulco's in North Olmsted . Service is fast & friendly , place looked clean & was busy when we got there. My date liked her food a lot. I'd go back & try something else from the menu. Gotta try their queso next time."}
{"text":"Been here for a week day lunch a few times.  Beautiful mural on the wall.  VERY friendly service.  Pretty normal/good/standard Mexican food.  Worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch and dinner at this location and the one in Broadview Heights.  Of the two, I prefer the BH location.  For both, the food is very good and affordable.  But, especially at lunch, the Independence location rushes people through like a subway.  Granted, efficient service is appreciated for a one hour lunch break, but these guys take it to the extreme.  The service is very impersonal and hurried."}
{"text":"Their menu is pretty standard mexican/tex-mex fair, with more of a lean towards traditional mexican, so not terribly spicy.

Drinks are good, service is great, and we've never had a wait."}
{"text":"Love Cozumel in Lakewood. This place is clean the waiters are more than accommodating. The food is always served hot and wonderful. My two favorites are the Carne Asada and the Pablano rellanos. The prices are more than reasonable. The guacamole is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great service tonight. And it was pretty packed. Food was delicious, hot, & served quickly. Love the Margaritas! Patio is nice also! :-)"}
{"text":"Best americanized mexican in the city.

GOOD STUFF:  This place has the best americanized mexican food in the city.  Large portions of enchiladas, fajitas.  I think their chile rellanos are awesome.  Reasonable prices.

BAD STUFF:  Americanized mexican food- I wouldn't go here if you're looking for native mexican.  Also, their frozen margaritas can be kind of weak.  Stick with beer or on the rocks

PRICE:  about 30 for two with a drink

OVERALL:  Favorite place for fast, fill up your belly, americanzied mexican in the city.  I usually go to this branch but have been to the one in Independence and it was exactly the same......"}
{"text":"Work associate came in from out of town and wanted Mexican food in Independence.  He suggested this location later in the evening and I told him that area looks a little rough with the old bowling alley, old hotel and some industrial park area.  But we headed down there anyhow to satisfy his craving.  

The place was well attended, we were greeted right away and still got seated in under a minute.  Waiter was very friendly and made some suggestions on the menu and for drinks.  My buddy took his suggestion for the \"Natural Margarita\" and he was very satisfied, stating it was one of the best he ever had.  

Food was great and seemed like they made it fresh.  Not like some places where it seems like it is all coming out of the same container and they just melt cheese over  the top.  Price was what we expected and even though the doors closed they never shoo'd us out.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"ok, the simple fact that I have been the mayor of Cozumel on four-square should tell the whole story. I love this place, awesome food, great salsa, perfect carry-out for a lazy sunday or a late night at work. I knew I called in orders to often when Pedro, (the usual manager) stopped asking for the name on my carry out orders and just said \"ok mike, ill see you in 10 min.\" 

That being said, the place could use a little bit of updating, that would be the only reason I cant give it a perfect review. heres the explanation, I im reviewing it for what it \"is\" I would go 5 stars, i understand its a low cost great food Mexican joint and thats all good. but as a business ingeneral, it could use some updating and therefor I have to say 4 stars.

IF YOU HAVE'NT TRIED IT YET YOU SHOULD!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, big pitcher of margaritas for $19 and more food than you should eat in one sitting...we left full and satisfied, I would definitely recommend cozumel and will be back to visit again......."}
{"text":"Wow, super fast! Super nice staff! And an A-OK to bringing the baby. They even have those sling things for the car seat.

We got there at around 11:20, just before the big business-caz takeover. The food came out like BAM! (Sorry that I sound like someone from Jersey Shore, but it's a bit hot out today, if you haven't noticed.) 

I had a taco salad with the tastiest shredded chicken. I love shredded chicken sooo much more than grilled in Mexican food. It's just tastier. The salad was great. I even liked the shell, which I usually turn my nose up at because it's normally greasy and tasteless. At Cozumel it was great!

And ... I had leftovers! Plenty of 'em. This place is cheap, fast, and delicious.

FIST PUUUMP!"}
{"text":"Very reasonable price (read that as inexpensive. ).
Food was good. Service was nothing to complain about and the place was packed. All in all a definite do over for sure."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Brunswick or Strongsville. 

Laid back, casual place. Excellent salsa to go with their house made chips. Margaritas are fantastic, and they pour draft beers in a 26oz mug (give or take).

All the entrees are good, trust me, I've had most of them. The only disappointment I have is the chicken strips in the chicken salad and other chicken strip type entrees. They don't taste or look like real chicken. More like some processed something or rather. The chicken breast meals are wonderful, as are the shredded beef and ground beef."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food and good margaritas with real lime juice. Services was fantastic! Food was just right. No frills here...just down to business Mexican. Sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good food from a \"typical\" Mexican restaurant.  Went here for lunch with work colleagues and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.

Started with meal with complimentary chips and salsa.  Chips were warm and the salsa was on the thinner side but had a vibrant flavor and a slight kick.  I always order a white cheese dip, and their version was creamy with a jalapeno kick that was quite tasty.

for main dishes I had a Chicken Taco Salad.  The tortilla shell was nicely fried with no greasy feel or taste.  Chicken came shredded with a nice flavor and fresh veggies on top.  One of my co-workers had a meal with sliced beef (not your normal ground or shredded varieties) which she said is hard to come by and was impressed with its flavor.

We will definitely be returning to this spot as it is convenient to where we work, prices are right and service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in Lakewood. Incredible food, great drinks, FRIED ICE CREAM, great prices and the service is absolutely top notch - these are some fantastic people here. We LOVE Cozumel!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place so when i was in the mood for Mexican i decided to try it out. I got what i always get at every Mexican place i got the 3 taco combo. The tacos were pretty good, the meat was lacking in seasonings but the cheese was delish, The rice was also yummy. 

Overall the food was pretty good, but I've def had better. Would i go back sure, but id have to be in the area because there are better places closer to were I live or are more worth the drive.

Also the prices were good, def cheaper combos then most places!"}
{"text":"First impressions we're the restaurant looked clean and smelled good. Rest room was clean as well. The food was good, not very spicy. They do have spicy foods marked on the menu with a chilli pepper symbol. Staff was friendly and attentive. They spoke English and Spanish. They had several beer special and the margaritas looked really good. I would return."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!  Dead fly fell off my plate onto my lap.  The waiters are too busy on their cell phones to care whether you needed refills or not and the food ~ YIKES!  I can't believe how many people are saying this stuff is good.  Too many margaritas to be able to taste I guess.  Definitely not for me or my family.  YUCK!"}
{"text":"This place is speedy and cheap for lunch. However, my friend (male) is offended by one of the murals in the bathroom. He feels the mural of the peasant above the sink is a bit too graphic for lunchtime. 

They let you order a pitcher of frozen margaritas with a straw here."}
{"text":"Raising the standard of \"standard Mexican fare\". I love Cozumel. Consistent quality. Great service. Delicious food. And the accept Belly points!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fajitas.  Period.  And how about a Grande Margarita for $5.99 at lunchtime?  Fast and friendly service every time."}
{"text":"Loved it, large tasty portions, good service.  Our child spilled his milk..staff was very helpful"}
{"text":"Love Cozumel's. I go almost every weekend and have tried many different dishes, the tacos, enchiladas, taquitos, chile relleno, fajitas, all of it very good. Chips and salsa are the best, my favorite of the places I've been to in the Cleveland and Akron areas. I'm fairly certain both are homemade, the salsa is definitely. Also, love their margaritas, they do not skimp on the tequila. Service is always very good as well. I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat ever. My family always eats here. It's a tradition to come here to announce important things, such as engagements and pregnancies. It really is a family friendly environment and the decor is great. The service is great, especially for large parties. The food is absolutely delicious. I recommend ordering the queso dip, it is so heavenly. I always get a chicken quesadilla with a side of rice and it is sooooo amazing."}
{"text":"I randomly stopped in last Friday and sure am happy that I did. It was pretty packed so we tried to see if the little bar area was open. The waiter that was buzzing around that area saw us looking and was very helpful. He went above and beyond to make sure we had the first available table in that area. 

I decided to try the Burrito El Diabla that was on the specials menu. WOW! This needs to be added to the menu ASAP! It had marinated beef tips inside with a spicy queso on top! PHENOMENAL! Words really don't cut it, you just need to try it!

I asked the server for a hotter salsa and he told me about their habanero salsa. If you don't like HOT, you can skip over this part. It was an orange habanero salsa with red onion and cilantro. It was amazing! Again, it packs a punch to don't go overboard.

Throughout the meal our sever was more than amazing. Checking on us often and clearing plates as we finished. He always had a smile and was more than happy to help us with anything we needed. Good waiters like this guy are hard to find. 

We tipped him generously and when he noticed it his eyes lit up and he says \" I love you guys, thank you so much\" I wish I could remember his name,. ( I believe it started with GER )

I've been here a couple times but I will be back in the next few days to get this same dish! Highly Recommended,"}
{"text":"As a review for cozumel i will say that nuevo acapuelco is AWESOME..cozumel eh...take out chimichanga was so so...and they serve the margaritas on the rocks in warm glasses...with not alot of ice.  Eh.  Go to north olmsted and eat at nuevo!"}
{"text":"People that frequent Cozumel come mostly for the margaritas, but the food is good too.  The ambiance is fun and festive and this place gets insanely busy.  Parking is VERY limited, so overflow parking is in the bowling alley parking lot next door.  Service is somewhere between average and slightly above average.  Just before the point where you're about to be annoyed by the wait, the waiter shows up."}
{"text":"Okay its been awhile since I have been online, today, that is. Well since just before lunch, and now its lunch. Anyway, I ate food here. And, it tasted really good! And, I drank here. And, it tasted really good. So, if you like to treat your palate to a treat, treat yourself to this place. I don't know another word for treat.

The patio is nice. Its especially nice if you have a baby in your crew. I do not mean the metaphorical baby. Like, your friend is acting like a baby, so you call him baby. By the way, the only reason he was acting like that is because you didn't want to watch his grandma for 2 days. What if she needed help walking down the stairs, I am very busy. Anyway, if you have a baby (real) at your table, she's going to have fun!

I really do like this place though: the quesadilla was really good and their non-frozen Margs are good. I'm not a big frozen guy, except the movie, but the book was better. Good night."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and drinks at great prices. I live right down the street, and I've enjoyed everything from sitting at the bar and ordering togo, to dining in with friends and family. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I've never tried it, but they also have a patio for those that enjoy outdoor dining. It would probably be the best place to enjoy a frozen strawberry margarita. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation. They screwed up our order. It was not what we had asked for, nor what the menu described. When we called back to complain, not only did they say that the manager was not in this evening, they laughed at us and told us that we should have 'read the menu description' of what we ordered, because that's what they gave us. My baja (fish) tacos did not have the \"mexican cole slaw\" that was described, and the california burrito did not come 'filled' with what was in the menu description.  Obviously, we are not happy with this restaurant, nor will we order from here again!"}
{"text":"Cozumel was great! I had a great time when I went there for my birthday. Amazing food, got the fijitas, which comes with three plates worth of food! The music and table was very nice to. Cost is always cheap and perfect do families. Finally the staff, they were great and very patient. Good place to go."}
{"text":"Yum! Thank you google for directing me to Cozumel! Passing thru on my way home from Columbus we were looking for a Mexican restaurant. The menu has a few items for those that are just there to accompany the Mexican food addict., mice touch. ..My companion had a regular Margarita and the chimichangas huge portion as expected and very yummy.  I also choose the chimichangas and was not disappointed.  The only disappointment was the salsa. .it was to watery for my taste. .i like a thicker salsa that stays on your chip!    Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place was just what I expected- a pretty Americanized Mexican restaurant. Nothing blew me away but it's all reasonably priced and definitely good. The salsa was tasty and they were quick to get us more. Good margaritas, as well. It's not all that authentic, as far as I can tell, and it's not my favorite Mexican place in the area but it's in a convenient location, we had no issues with the service and the food is all pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"Very standard Americanized Mexican fare, reasonably well executed, but not great. My wife and I both ordered margaritas, was disappointed not to be offered any choice of tequila, they were reasonably priced but mediocre. Garnished with a nice fresh, thick wedge of lime which was a nice touch. The free chips and salsa were a highlight, fresh chips served warm and a nice salsa with plenty of fresh cilantro flavor. For entrees I order two burritos, chicken and steak, my wife ordered shrimp fajitas, the kids had bean tacos. Everything was decent, nothing was particularly good. Guacamole and refried beans were both bland, looked like they may have come from a can. Dining room was kitschy and fun if a bit dark.  Service was friendly and fast. Overall, a middle of the road experience. Wouldn't be opposed to going again but Nothing in particular to recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, we use to get dinner from a Mexican restaurant on 117th but now we prefer cozumel but if you order take out make sure you double check your order they seldom forget things, for example extra chips, appetizers,and desserts! Our dinners are always wonderful but whoever is putting the take out orders together seems to be lacking attention to fill correctly!  But overall this is the Mexican restaurant to dine at in lakewood!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food I've ever had. 
Wonderful service. 
Fast. 
Affordable. 

Do I need to say more. This place is always jam packed. Order the fajitas, there great."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Food was good. Not the 'best ever' but that's OK. Guac didn't have much flavor - I suggest upping the lime and add some cilantro. The pico de gallo that came as a side was excellent. The fact they had Vegetarian options was nice. 

Prices were great - if you want a solid mex meal for not too much dough give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times over the years.  It's just decent Mexican food.  Fast, tasty and a good price.  It's not as good as Nuevo Acapulco but I certainly wouldn't turn down a trip to have dinner there.  Their 4th star is solely because I was able to get tipsy off of just one margarita...they're strong!  It's also not as busy as other (better) Mexican restaurants so it's nice to not have to wait on a Friday or Saturday night.  It's a very convenient location so I'm sure we'll be back at some point."}
{"text":"Yep, this is a basic Mex place but it is a fav of mine.  Super prices, fresh food, great service.  They are always busy but they get you in and out in record time and the food is really tasty.  But if you want to hang with your peeps and enjoy the evening then the table is yours and they keep the margaritas and chips coming.  

I don't do beef or pork but there is plenty to choose from and I've enjoyed every meal.  There is a small patio for a summer evening or the air is running if you want to stay cool.  This is my go-to local place for a beer and some good Mexican.  Oh, one more thing -- they have fab guacamola and salsa.  A great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food and service   The la diablo burrito is excellent along with the churro beans"}
{"text":"All I can say is we have a problem. There is something in their cheese sauce and re-fried beans that have made us addicted. This place has become a 1 time a week stop for us. Sometime even twice if we're feeling lazy or just have the craving. The beans alone keep me going back. I've tried to replicate them at home and can't even touch it. They are putting something extremely unhealthy or something extremely illegal in them. It doesn't stop at the sides mind you. They put just as much love in their entrees. Our go-to dishes are enchiladas verdes, fire burrito, the pork burrito, chimichangas and fish tacos. Meat is always very tender. (Get the shredded over the grilled though)
Now yes this is a Mexican restaurant catering to our American needs. And because it took over an Ihop building, it doesnt feel at all like a Mexican restaurant. Although you'll find the Most Interesting Man In The World greeting you with a sombrero on his head.... But the menu is still nice, and the food has yet to disappoint.

P.S.... $15 PITCHER WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Clean, efficient, pleasant staff, and good food.  Had enchiladas verde and Rojas, as well as chimichangas for our dinners tonite.  Chips and salsa were great- just the right heat for multiple family members.  Pitcher of tasty margaritas as well.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think Cozumel is awesome Mexican!  Their chips and salsa are the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant!  They come out hot, thin, crispy, salty and delicious!  I've had several different things on the menu and it is always good!"}
{"text":"Often drove past this place and always wanted to stop in and see about it. (With my love of Authentic Mexican). Lunch special is pretty good, the picture below is a lunch special chicken fajita. Experience was overall good. Will definitely come back to explore the menu further. Kinda was in a rush so i didn't have time to sit down and do a full menu run down. 

UPDATE!

Recently went back for lunch with my company, decided to check out the fajitas this time. They did not disappoint, it's a lot of food and extremely hard to finish but I persevered and finished lol. Not a bad problem to have! Definitely can see this place becoming a favorite spot of mine. So if you're ever in Independence, Ohio and are looking for lunch or dinner stop by!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had a big party and were seated pretty quickly. The outdoor patio was nice (complete with its own bar), but we chose to sit indoors because it was about to rain.

The chips, salsa, guacamole and queso were great. Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy the food (considering we ate about 10 baskets of chips). The chips were hot and fresh, unlike many other places I've been to. The waiter even brought us a spicy habanero salsa in case the first one was too mild. The margaritas were also very good, and pretty strong.

For dinner, I ordered the spinach enchiladas. I asked for a side of beans instead of some other things on the dish, but they accidentally subbed the rice for the beans. No worries, they brought out a side of rice right after I asked. The enchiladas were good and you could tell they were freshly made. I wish the inside was seasoned though, as it only contained sauteed spinach and nothing else. Bf got a combo plate, which included a cheese enchilada. Little did we know, it was a QUESO enchilada. Basically one of the most heavenly things ever!"}
{"text":"Even though the place was pretty packed, service was quick and friendly.  As is my wont, when in unfamiliar territory I ask for a dish recommendation, and my waitress served me up some Pollo con Creme (iirc) which was pretty tasty and more than I could eat by myself.

I liked the kick the fresh salsa had, and the warm corn-chips.

It was priced reasonably, on par with other cuisines in the area."}
{"text":"Cozumel is our go to for standard Mexican fare. The restaurant is always clean and the staff always friendly and helpful. Prices are fair, and a good value if you're looking for a dinner out that doesn't break the bank. 

We also appreciate the vegetarian options they offer, as my husband is vegetarian. They have a whole page of their menu that is just for vegetarians. It's nice that they offer more than just the typical cheese options! My husbands favorite includes their veggie quesadilla which is literally packed full of vegetables."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Cozumel.  The food was maybe slightly above average for a Mexican restaurant and would probably rate closer to three stars, but the service and the friendliness of the staff really earned the restaurant a fourth star.

We were treated to a basket of nachos and some salsa within seconds of being seated and our server came by for our drink orders shortly after.  We got a pitcher of sangrias for $18 and our glasses came pre-filled.  The sangria was nothing to write home about... it was good, but I think it came from a large plastic jug... but the price was right.

I got the pablanos dinner, which is one of my favorites.  How can you go wrong with a battered, fried pablano pepper stuffed with cheese?  It was good (like I said, slightly above average).  Afterwards we ordered some fried ice cream, to the delight of our server, and it was a great way to end a meal.  I didn't even want to finish the last half glass of sangria because I wanted the fried ice cream taste to linger.

The price was great, too, with two entreees, a pitcher of sangrias, and dessert for less than $40."}
{"text":"We go to this place when we are looking for a quick, reliable, inexpensive meal. The service is ridiculously prompt, the place is clean, they have a nice patio....lots of vegetarian dishes, yummy guacamole too. Not particularly gourmet or anything, but definitely the best of the 'run of the mill' Mexican places around town."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a fantastic price. I had the Lenten special -shrimp and grilled tilapia tacos for $6 with rice and beans. The rice and beans were good, but the tacos were excellent! I tried a little of the seafood burrito and was impressed with that as well.
Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Ample parking, quick to be seated, wait staff is fast and efficient, complimentary chips and salsa are delicious, their menu contains the standard Mexican fare but also some specialty items (I love spicy food so I always look for heat indicators on the menu and they've got them!!). The margaritas are pretty standard but we go through pitchers pretty fast so we don't need anything fancy. All in all I really enjoy this place and it's always on the list when I end up visiting family in Brunswick."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, service is incredibly fast.

The waiter, noticing a member of our dining party is from india, said something in Hindi (the word for \"thank you\"), then brought out a little tray of scorchingly hot salsa verde, on the house.  It was a nice touch.  

Some of the individual tables of people are pretty loud,  but the overall noise level in the place isn't that bad.

In sum: good food, excellent service, and cheap. Yay!"}
{"text":"Update: I had to drop a couple stars. I don't know what's going on there but every time we order takeout, the girl taking the order always seems confused about the menu and our order has been wrong every time. Even dining in, the last couple times were not up to Cozumel par. Tonight I ordered three grilled steak tacos with chopped onion and salsa verde on the side. I like to build my own. What I got was grilled onions and some completely different salsa on the tacos. They were terrible. WTF this is a Mexican restaurant salsa verde is salsa verde...GREEN. It's not a hard concept. It was just a very disappointing experience and I think it might be time to explore some other options outside of Cozumel. I honestly feel like I got effed tonight....and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Really nice inexpensive Mexican restaurant.  The food is really good.  The staff and service are prompt and friendly.  The decor could use a little updating.  Get a sampler platter for a variety of items.  Ask if you don't know what something.  Get something more than just tacos."}
{"text":"The food is alright, nothing bad but nothing great. Sometimes you'll get a bad waiter or a very friendly one! It all just depends. There aren't many actual Mexican restaurants on the west side (around Lakewood/River) so I do go here when I want some Mexican food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican in all of Lakewood! Amazing food and drinks and service at an amazing price."}
{"text":"Consistently Excellent! Good food served by kind and prompt waiters. Yummy tacos and combo plates. Easy Parking, cheap drinks and all-you-can-eat chips... doesn't get any better for a fun summer dinner date!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here a lot. Always clean and good service. Never a bad meal"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here a lot. Always clean and good service. Never a bad meal. well seasoned and always hot.."}
{"text":"The food was great I order off the chicken enchilada off the lunch menu which included one enchilada refried beans and rice. You can actually see the amount of chicken in the enchilada which was just the right amount.  my sister ordered the super  burrito and it had so much chicken she had to take some of it out. Or about an hour she said she took it out because it was dry (see the picture )"}
{"text":"I hate giving 5's, I wish this were a 10 point scale... anyway, Cozumel is great at what they do.  They put booze in their margs, for reals... IT'LL GET YOU DRUNK, YEAH, I'M SCREAMING, THAT'S HOW I TALK! (thanks mr. chappelle), I recommend mango, raspberry or strawberry.  I suppose it's hard to mess up mexican food, however, most restaurants would've given me a bad experience by now, these guys never really have.  I've been here a lot.  Almost exclusively in the bar (I eat too, don't judge), but now they have a patio.  Aside from the somewhat ugly, rundown surrounding area, the patio is really nice.  Panini's across the street has a patio too, you just have to embrace the days inn and the power lines."}
{"text":"Pros: lots of chips and salsa. A delicious vegetarian tortilla soup. An entire vegetarian section of the menu. Huge margaritas.

Cons: unfriendly staff. So-so food. Boring ride and beans."}
{"text":"An acceptable Mexican/American restaurant. Food was plentiful and fresh tasting. 

Salsa was disappointing, as it had a canned tomato taste. I couldn't quite place it. 

I had the camarones la crema (purposely ordered a comparison dish to my favorite Mexican restaurant for a fair rating), and while it was good, it did not provide me with the mouthgasm that Nuevo Acapulco always does.

Place was very clean, and the service was excellent. Our waiter was watching our table and was very attentive. Prices were reasonable. 

This place was fine, but did not live up to all the hype I've heard. If I had never been to the \"other\", I'd rate this higher."}
{"text":"Oh Cozumel...you wonderful wonderful place. If you're thinking this is a cheap, Americanized Mexican joint, offering sauce laden, cheese covered dishes, then you're right. And I love it,. 

Mexican is the holy grail of hangover foods for me. And I've frequented my fair share of Mexican joints like this in college- the fish bowl margaritas, free chips and salsa, portions big enough for lunch the next day. Cozumel does all that and more, and does it better. Oh the nostalgia. 

I order the veggie fajitas, which surprisingly include a large array of veggies (broccoli, zucchini, peppers, onions, etc). Delicious every time. Sometimes I also go basic and just order up a large plate of rice and beans...its a meal all by itself. My man always tries something different and is happy every time.  

I have friends that live right by here, and they seriously come here once a week. The food is always good, the drinks are always strong, and our bill is always so cheap. What more can you want, really? Pro tip, fill up on that free chips and salsa goodness, then take 3/4 of your entree home for later. Am I the only person that does that?"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and the patio is nice, but the service was terrible.  At one point our server was carrying a bag of trash past our table when he noticed my empty soda (which had been empty for several minutes).  He put the trash down on the floor next to our table and snatched up my glass. Never washed his trash hands, Gross!  Seated at the bar were several of his friends,  he spent several minutes looking at pictures on his friend's phone before finally returning with a soda that there was no way in hell I was ever going to drink. I will pobably not go here ever again."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was outstanding!!!!! Hot, fresh salsa and nachos the second you sat down,,,,drinks refreshed...food out in under 5 minutes . Great portions and gulac to die for. The fajita platter filled up my 15 year old teenage boy and then he couldn't finish his gorgeous fried ice cream. Best restaurant experience we've had at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and there was only 1 person. Took 5 minutes before we were asked if we wanted a drink. In their defense one of the alcohol reps was there with free shirts and new drinks for us to try while we waited. The tacos were what you would expect for an Ohio mexican food place.  My wife got a rice and bean burrito with guacamole, sour creme, lettuce and tomatoes and everything was charged separate  so a basic burrito ultimately cost $14. So extremely lame! Service almost seemed forced. Maybe it was because a real mexican actually showed up to eat here. Seeing as I was born and raised in central California, lived in San Diego and Texas I Have High expectations. All and all it could have been worse. Just mediocre for this guy."}
{"text":"Typical chi chi's style americanized inauthentic mexican. Which i like from time to time. Service is good most of the time.  Eat here way more then i wish due to convenience."}
{"text":"I have been going there since it opened when it was called Los Molcajates, and have never had a bad experience.  If its crowded, you may wait a while to sit, but food usually comes to your table quickly. The tomatillo salsa is my favorite-you have to ask for it - it's a bit spicy!  The fahita dinner for two is another one of my favorites.  The rest of the menu items are pretty typical for a Mexican Restaurant.  Prices are fair.  The servers are generally pleasant.  It's very consistent."}
{"text":"Cozumel is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. They have a large menu, and the food is good. (I usually get the combination platter #8)
My favorite part about Cozumel has to be the chips and salsa for no extra cost--so addicting! My family and I usually get the cheese dip to go along with it.
Recently, Cozumel has made a few small renovations. Although small, there is no doubt it made a large impact. They improved the patio and the atmosphere inside. It now seems less crowded, and has more natural light. If you have a taste for Mexican food, try Cozumel!

Side note: The service is generally fast and the wait is never outrageous. (if there is one)"}
{"text":"Get the Cozumel fajitas every time and I love them! The margaritas are huge and delicious. Love the free chips and salsa! This is a frequent stop for our family!"}
{"text":"Personal mark , good ! They used a lot of oil, which I like a lot. I think their food is delicious,

{"text":"My go to Mexican restaurant. The fresh guacamole with mango mixed in is amazing! So fresh and great on anything. The rice I can eat just a side of that for dinner and can never go wrong with one of their margritas. Great staff as well."}
{"text":"So fast! The service was amazing and the food came out in record time. It's a clean well run place. The food was good too. Better than the average mexican joint. But not as fresh as some of the edgy mexican joints."}
{"text":"This is better than the typical mexican joint. It is very clean and the chips are warm! I really appreciate it when they keep the chips warm. Tastes so much better. Service was great and the food was good and fast."}
{"text":"Our meal and service was delicious and the quantity was more than sufficient for a big appetite. I recommend this Mexican food restaurant for families as well as individual diners. My tortillas were fresh made corn tortillas and just delicious."}
{"text":"I would give 0 if I could walked in at 7:30 and finally got our order in just before 8 o clock. We got our cheese dip and nothing else at 8:30 people who were seated 45 minutes after us had their food before us. So I'm heading to el jalapeño now where I'm sure they'll be glad to take my money."}
{"text":"Many-times have I stopped at Cozumel for lunch. All of the food is excellent and hits the table in front of you so fast you'd think McDonald's had franchised their operation. 

Service is extremely friendly and efficient. I never see the bottom of my glass as its always being filled. Always asked if we'd like more chips and salsa -- which by the way are freakin' awesome! Chips come out of the kitchen warm, salsa is tasty especially when mixed with some Habanero sauce. Everyone tries to speak to me in Spanish which I find extremely charming and also adds to the ambiance of the establishment. 

Back to the tasty food. I tend to get the same item Enchiladas and a Tamale. Meats taste freshly made with real ingredients. My entree choices have always been cooked to perfection. On top of it all (literally) is a mound of pico de galo, sour creme, and guacamole. 

Highly recommended! Lunch is a great time to stop in."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and the food was excellent. Very hot and well prepared. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. Definitely will return again. 

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the service could of been better. There was only 3 other parties and it took awhile for the waitress to come back to take our order, and were never asked for refills. But that won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Terrific Mexican food, and tasty margaritas served in enormous goblets! What's not to love?

I've now eaten at Cozumel twice, and definitely plan to visit again. I love the Baja fish tacos, and my wife got the chorizo + steak tacos. Everything is consistently fresh, hot, and delicious. Service is good too. 

During our first visit, I had to excuse myself to take a phone call. Our waiter checked on my wife, who I'd left alone at the table, just to make sure everything was cool. We appreciated this, and on top of the great food and bar service, personal touches like this had us planning a return visit.

The \"All Natural Margarita\" is a tasty mix of tequila and mango/citrus flavors, but I really liked their \"Cucumber Margarita\" best. It's crisp and light and refreshing. A great choice on a hot day, just make sure you have a safe ride home afterwards. They pour a stiff drink!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite 'cheap' Mexican restaurants for years.  Your food always comes out fast and it is always hot.  The waiters are always super great in making changes to your order and they have some of the best margaritas in town! 

The place is clean, cleaner than the other two cozumels I have been to, and the staff is friendly.  They have a nice patio for when the weather is nice as well.  I feel their guacamole is always fresh and their queso is a go to.  

I love their grilled shrimp taco salad, yes I even eat their shrimp and haven't had a problem with it yet, and their chimichangas.  I always add peppers and onions to my salad because they are a little bare, but the sauce on the chimichangas is really good!  I don't feel your meal can ever be bad here but you have to go into it expecting what you are going to get, which is food served quickly from a line.  The flavors can surprise you though!"}
{"text":"First time for a meal.
The staff is friendly and your four comes out quick.
I had steak Taco's with rice and beans.
Nothing special about the food except the steak was very tough and I could only eat one of them.
Will try again to see if dinner is better."}
{"text":"Cozumel used to be my favorite restaurant in Brunswick. Unfortunately, my take out order has yet again been messed up. The first time it was messed up, my burrito supreme was a tiny chicken burrito with a side of beans and rice. The burrito supreme is half chicken and half beef with an awesome ranchero sauce on top and a side of rice. Last night my burrito supreme was a tiny half beef and half chicken burrito with sides of beans and rice. I called them, they said they'd fix it if I brought back the incorrect food. It's nearby, not a huge deal. I bring it all back, but stupidly don't check on my way out with the correct food. My salsa order is missing. I just gave up because I wasn't going back again and I should've looked harder. I was mostly inspecting the burrito. The ground beef lacks flavor without the ranchero sauce, so when it's missing it's noticeable. 

Their service used to be impeccable and the food always delicious. The food isn't as seasoned as well as I remember it, but they're still really nice. I'm not as frequent a customer as I used to be. It seems like whenever I eat in or take out and a burrito supreme is involved, my order gets messed up. Maybe I should find a new favorite dish there."}
{"text":"I ordered fajitas and the meat was awful!  The shrimp wasn't cleaned well, the beef looked like shoe leather, the pork had strange rubbery segments and the chicken was dry.  Would never go there again."}
{"text":"This location has the nicest and fastest service I've experienced. The food is always delicious and it always brought out within 5-10 minutes of us ordering. They are always on top of refills and are attentive to additional chips needed. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"This Is a great place to go with and without kids. Food is amazing, and kids meal are pretty generous. Love the free salsa and chips! Servers are always polite and get the order right."}
{"text":"I am new to the area; transplant from Cleveland East suburbs.

I came here with a couple co-workers.. Kelly.. Just had to come here!  Cozumel is the best.. you'll see...

First of all... Thank you Kelly!! LOL.. Just great food and really friendly service. I can not wait to go back.

I had the fried chimichanga (don't judge) for lunch. Now thinking this will be a pretty small portion and me being... well really hungry.. I ordered the dinner portion. OMG way to much food. That said it was SO good I had to finish it, all of it. I felt really crappy for hours after (I blame Kelly and Jeff *My Boss*) ;).

In all seriousness the place had a warm family owned feel. The food was high quality and cooked perfectly. The homemade chips and salsa were overflowing and excitingly delicious.

I always try to offer an accurate and balanced review. This place left me excited to return and is honestly a cut above the others I have visited."}
{"text":"This location is much better than the Lakewood location! It is like night and day. Great Mexican food. Fast service. Reasonable lunch menu. Lunch is fast as week. Highly recommend. They have Pepsi products."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but was yet again disappointed.  First off I ordered a Skinny Margarita and for $14.99 it should have been so much better than it was.  Overly sweet and very little margarita taste. I would have sent it back but of course the waitress did not appear again.  The people with me couldn't get salt on theirs either.  Then the food comes.  Carne Asada?  Don't do it.  I ordered medium rare it was almost well done and 1/2 of it, literally 1/2 of it was fat.  The rest of the plate was adequate.  The waitress finally comes back and I explain to her that it was 50% fat and she was polite and apologized.  Bill comes and full price for one lousy margarita, a plate of fat and a very watered down cocktail, $35.  I appreciate the apology but I am not exactly sure how that helps me."}
{"text":"Great food, prices, and atmosphere. As authentic as it comes and they give you generous portions."}
{"text":"Property is located in the best western hotel complex. On the weekends use the complementary valet as parking space is limited. It is busy on the weekend. The service is efficient. The ambience is typical Mexican with false ceilings and Mexican art and painting on the walls. The chips and salsa are standard affair. Half pitcher of golden margarita is $11 which is not bad but it is definitely diluted compared to other restaurants. The pollo loco and the fajita bowl and tasty but nothing special. Adding jalapeños on the dishes are 75cents additional. Would return if I'm on that side of town especially around dinner time after having tried other area restaurants!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here almost weekly for a year now. There must be something addictive in the enchiladas, burritos, and chimichangas because we just can't get enough. Love the service and atmosphere. Can't beat the price. Our favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food was fresh and had excellent flavor.  The staff is friendly and you get so much food for your money. The prices were very reasonable and I highly recommend going here for authentic spanish food."}
{"text":"There is little good I can say, except that the service was good. Food was bland and a soggy mélange of cheesy horribleness. Far from authentic, tasted like it came out of a grocery store freezer. So many better options for Mexican. Sure, it's cheap, but so what."}
{"text":"The service here! These guys work harder than anyone around. Mexican comfort food in the old IHOP.  The margaritas are the size of your head and the chips are bottomless-- can't ask for more."}
{"text":"If you really want good, delicious Mexican food done right, this is the place for it, however don't expect anything too out of the box. This Mexican restaurant might not have any more or less then the next Mexican place but they make good food and do it consistently well. I haven't yet tried the liquor here but I'll give it a shot next time I stop in and might change my mind on the rating of this place. The Hostess who sat me and my friend was very kind and so was the server who took our drinks and order.

+Great simple Mexican food done right
+Great hospitality
+Fair prices

-Nothing too special
-Somewhat bland environment"}
{"text":"My uncle always says, \"The best Mexican restaurants are always found in old converted chain restaurants or gas station parking lots.\" I think he may be in to something here. Cozumel is in an old IHOP and it's delicious! This is my favorite location and the service is great. The chips and salsa always taste very fresh and the waiters and kitchen are always very accommodating about vegetarianizing things for me."}
{"text":"They have a new special menu.   The two of six are awesome,  the chimichanga fajitas and the Maya special are best thing on menu.   The chimichanga is served over veggies cooked fajitas style.   Three is option for meat are beef and chicken, the ground beef is well seasoned.  The Maya special is a mix of steal, bacon and ham loaded with poblano puppies smothered in cheeses.   Ask for tortillas for better experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. If you've eaten at one of the other locations you can expect the same service here. Food comes out super fast and tastes great. Waiters and waitresses are great.

Ask for the cheese dip when they bring out the chips and salsa. Its a couple bucks extra but well worth it."}
{"text":"Foods good but pricing should match up with the portion size. Adult meal looked more like a kids meal @ adult pricing. Besides portion size food was very tasty. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"My friend invited me here for dinner the other night. I'm so glad she did, otherwise I probably never would have found it. It seems really authentic, which I appreciate, especially in Cleveland. The food was really good, too, and our waitress was a 4/5,"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Recently moved here to Brunswick and my friend took me here raving about it. I got soft tacos and they were out of this world. You would think a taco is a taco but it's not. Very authentic and fresh. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Cozumel is solid. I'd lump this place in with all of the other similar restaurants in Northeast Ohio that cater to people that like your typical Americanized Mexican food experience. If you've been to El Tolteca in Brooklyn, El Rodeo in North Olmsted, Chili Peppers in Euclid, Si Senor in Kamm's Corners...I think  you get the picture. They are essentially the same restaurant and offer the same food cooked the same way using the same ingredients. You might prefer one over the other for whatever reason (closer to your house, they put more booze in their margaritas, etc) but unique they are not.

Cozumel is a chain. There is one in Broadview Heights, one in Independence (this one) and one in Lakewood. This particular location is plopped down in the middle of a forgotten and pretty rundown section of the city next to a freeway overpass, a creepy trucker hotel and what is probably the best bowling alley in Northeast Ohio. Don't go walking around after dinner unless you want to play human Frogger to get to the Panini's across the street.

The food is just what you'd expect, no surprises, and it's pretty damn tasty. Here's the method. Take the same four ingredients, meat, cheese, beans, rice, wrap in some sort of round, flat object and serve on an oval plate that is one of three colors, orange, yellow, blue or green. I'm always amazed at how places like this can create a menu of hundreds of seemingly unique dishes with such a small number of ingredients. Santaria if you ask me. 

If you get embarrassed trying to pronounce the menu items you can order by number. Like most Americans, I prefer to butcher the native tongue of a large variety of ethnic groups whenever I can. You'll get served by speedy Mexicans, you'll get free chips and salsa, the tables and menus will be a little sticky, and there is a very high probability you won't get food poisoning.

The decor is Mexican restaurant 101. Ceiling painted with clouds, murals of Mexican life on the walls, sponge-painting, faux bricks, soccer on the flatscreens and icicle lights hanging down. The only thing missing were those maniacally colorful carved wooden chairs with the suns. You know the ones. I kinda missed 'em. Overall, pretty clean environs.

On the evening of our visit, a pre-bowling visit, of course, the place was hopping. Our server was friendly enough but spoke very little. It's all business here. I ordered a beer, Dos Equis Amber on tap. It had to be, right? The server asked what sized I'd like, small, medium or grande. I asked about the difference between the three. His response, and I quote, \"They are different sizes.\" Thanks for clearing that up. The order was taken and food was delivered:

Chips and salsa - The chips are your typical white corn variety and the salsa is nothing special, mild but fresh. Unfortunately the basket of chips we were served was mostly bits and pieces. Kinda hard to dip those, right?

Bean dip - I'd actually call this one cheese dip with some beans. White, creamy cheese and refried beans. I could finish off a bag of tortilla chips with this stuff. Tasty and just a bit of heat.

Carnitas Fajitas - Probably one of the most generous portions I've seen at a restaurant in this genre. We ate leftovers for three days with this bad boy. Tons of tender pullapart pork cooked with red onions served with rice and beans, flour tortillas, fresh guac and pico. One of the best renditions we've had.

Mexican Tacos - Holy triple bypass with a side of stents, batman. These things were so greasy I could watch TV through the tortillas. Three soft tacos. A mixture of chorizo and beef grilled with onions inside a pair of flour tortillas. The innards were tasty enough but you could have lubed a Mack truck with these things. The sides of salsa verde, diced onion and cilantro were a nice touch.

If this is how Mexicans eat I don't understand how their life expectancy isn't somewhere around 35. Damn. Not that I don't love it, mind you, because I do. I just can't eat it more than once a month. I also don't recommend consuming three Mexican tacos right before you bowl three games. I was playing with fire. Cozumel is exactly what you'd expect and perfect for curbing your Mexicravings. Sure, it's got very little to set itself apart from its competitors but sometimes that's what you want. I thought the dishes we had were good, a step above what we have experienced at El Tolteca and the like but nothing that wowed. If you're a Mexisnob you won't like it. If you're everyone else, you probably will."}
{"text":"Don't let the sparse and lack of lackluster on the outside influence to keep driving by Cozumel.  On a recent visit for lunch,  I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service at this location.

First, the food isn't 100% authentic Mexican, if you truly want such, you will need to fly south of the border.  Otherwise, in the american-mexican cuisine category,  Cozumel seems to offer pretty decent quality food.  The serving size is large and loaded with rice, sour-cream, beans, lettuce - the usual fixings.  My lunch order was the Tamale entree in lunch portion, which consisted of two large tamale (chicken and pork) topped with guac, sour cream, served aside beans, rice and other fixings.  My dish was full of flavor and well balanced moisture to the tamale (something not all mexican restaurante get right) the shredded lettuce was crisp and fresh the guac was well balance with avocado and red onion, the rice was perfectly made and the beans (not my favorite at other places) were actually nice.  In all dish was well made and well presented on the platter.  

The serving staff were courteous and had the usual mexican restaurant flare - 'si senor' although I would say they were more attentive than other places.  Our food was served without much delay and several times the wait staff ensured everything was OK with us.

Cozumel can seat a large crowd given its seating areas (front room, back/side room), and an outside deck.  This place is a must visit if you are in the area and are craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Great Mexican Food I love the tamales  and sizzling fajitas. There salsa is fresh and service is always great it looks clean and the food is given in generous portions . Margaritas are also great ."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot.  The food is pretty good and prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout. Usually, that means bare minimum on extras, so I ordered chips and such. IT CAME WITH CHIPS!  So I wasted, $3 on the extra bag of chips. And a small bag is A LOT!  Food was pretty good and the lunch prices were nice."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food period. The chips are fresh and crisp. The salsa is plentiful and tasty. The portions are delicious and large.   The restaurant is cozy so come early to get a seat!"}
{"text":"Went here to get some takeout for the family.  Had a margarita while I waited, which was the best part of the entire experience.  The margaritas are very good.  Waited for almost twenty five minutes for my togo.  Got my food--4 dinners packaged in a huge brown paper bag with handles, which I thought seemed to be a lot, but I figured they knew what they were doing.  I didn't bother to rifle around in the bag or check the order. 

Got home five minutes later and went to grab said bag off the passenger seat floor  Not only was there a huge pile of grease on the floor, but the second I picked it up...?  $50 of Mexican food all over my leather seats, me, and as I was freaking, threw the rest on the driveway as it was tumbling out of the bag.  The entire bottom came out, all the dinners open, food everywhere.

So I was upset, trying to clean my car, and called the restaurant.  If it were up to me I would've just asked for a refund and been done with it; but my family was expecting to eat, so.  I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm not sure the manager understood what I was saying had transpired--he kept saying \"ok\", and then HUNG UP on me.  

The experience was bad enough, but rude customer service always makes it worse.  I worked in restaurants for 15 years and would never dream of hanging up on a customer.  When I called back, a young woman answered the phone and was compassionate and kind.  I explained the state of my car, with food all over the leather seats, and she said she would call the owner.  Though this is a chain, she stated that there was not a corporate number to call.  The front of my car is covered in grease and smells like enchiladas.  The food was remade, and was adequate for what it was. This was all due to packaging and could've been avoided with some simple common sense on behalf of the restaurant.  Clearly the lids were not closed, and unbeknownst to me, leaking within the bag.

Save your money and go to Neuvo Acapulco or El Rodeo.  The managers are much nicer there. I doubt they'd ever hang up on you if a problem arose (which hasn't in the dozens of times I've been to either place!)."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice. Food is delicious, freshly made, and good prices. We love getting take out from Cozumel!"}
{"text":"As I've commented on other reviews of Mexican restaurants in CLE, my expectations have permanently been lowered as I have come to face the fact that I won't find a joint that compares to the Mexican food in Arizona. I visit all of these places now intending on being satiated but not satisfied. 

Let me just say that I think Cozumel is pretty good. I visited a couple of months ago during an evening break from studying. 

Their chips and salsa are above average for the places I've been in the Cleveland area. I'd actually even consider their food slightly better than most other places around here too. Where they dip below the others, however, is in the service. Our waiter was totally disinterested in helping us. I never got a single refill on my drink and had to ask for the bill after waiting almost 30 minutes after finishing our meal. I can't recall what I ordered although I remember thinking it was pretty good minus the distaste in my mouth for receiving sub-par service.

In the end I'd probably go back and give it another chance."}
{"text":"As usual the food was very good and appetizing, portions to dollar ratio is very well balanced. The service is very efficient, the margaritas are out of this world as well. I am a repeat customer just the first time here as a yelper. The specials ate always unique, I had the Baja tacos, fish a slaw with guacamole and a mango salsa, outstanding. Wife got the duo which is a quesadilla w/chicken, chorizo, and pineapple, tomato salsa with cheese melted over top, which she,Could not finish."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?!? 

I love it here!! It's one of my favorite places to eat! First of all, the staff is awesome. Very friendly. Service is pretty quick..even when it's busy. 

I just ate here two days ago and I'm ready to go back. 

The last visit I tried a dish I haven't had yet, since I go so often. I had combination #11 which is a beef burrito and a chile poblano with a side of rice and beans for around $9. It was good..I would order again.

Their fajitas are delicious! And unless you're starving to death or can regularly eat a huge meal, you're likely to have leftovers..and those are just as good for lunch the next day :)

I've also had the burrito deluxe which I could almost call my \"go to\" but the downside of this dish is that it's only the burrito(s)..no rice and beans. Sometimes it's nice to break up the continuity of the same food, ya know? 

Another dish I've had is the fajita rice bowl, which is good but I would prefer the fajitas themselves or the other dishes I've had.

The chips and salsa here are among some of the best I've had at any Mexican restaurant. Chips are warm, salsa is fresh. They go very well with a cold beer or margarita. But what doesn't? :)

If you're in the area and you're searching for a good Mexican spot I would 100% recommend Cozumel! 

Who's hungry? Lunch date anyone?! ;)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have had Mexican food that I did not like and I always like Mexican food. I ordered the shrimp tacos and the shrimp were unseasoned and cold. The guacamole on top of  the tacos was literally frozen. (Like avocado ice cream on top of my taco. UGH) They were really poorly put together no flavor at all. My friend ordered the enchiladas and she said that they  were average. Our drinks were okay. We ordered margaritas they were a nice size for the price . The restaurant atmosphere was cool.  We originally wanted to sit outside but it is close to a mulch place and the smell almost ruined my appetite. The service was okay. There were a lot of people there so assumed the food was going to be good but it was not. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with dinner at Cozumel. Margaritas are always made perfectly, food is great and service is always fast. The wait times for a table can be a little long, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"worst service ever! after a total of 5 (yes 5!) different servers,  i still had to find and go get my own to go box and asked 3 time for the check! and all the stuff was more interested in stand ing around in a large group conversing and flirting with one another than any of the customers."}
{"text":"Went there for my cousin's wedding eve dinner...food was okay.

I was a little iffy about Mexican Food at this time, which was six years ago. Now with less fear of Americanized Mexican Food...I'll take the challenge, and I love Bohemia Beer!"}
{"text":"Went into Cozumel at 9pm on a weekday night when they close at 10. There were still a ton of people there and even some people who came after us so didn't feel so bad.  About 5 minutes after we ordered our food, we received it. The chips were very good, but the salsa tasted like it came from a jar. I'm very particular when it comes to my mexican salsa. 

My friend and I got half a pitcher of the frozen strawberry/raspberry margarita which was more than enough for two people! The margarita was good, not too strong and not too sweet. 

The food was ok, nothing too great, but good enough to come again. I would love to try their regular margarita next time to try it out. 

The waitstaff was very nice, friendly, quick and efficient."}
{"text":"The food is good but I've had better. Great prices and portions and their piña coladas are definitely 5 stars! I feel like the food is a bit bland at times though."}
{"text":"Cozumel is some of the best Mexican (Americanized) that I've had. Their food is prepared perfectly, the servers always have a humorous attitude, and the service is fast. 

The salsa they provide with their complimentary chips has hints of Mango and a good flavor without overpowering cilantro or onion like some others. 

I have ordered a variety of menu items in the several times we've ate there and never once was I dissatisfied. 

This was the first place we went after moving to Lakewood this past winter. It was freezing outside, snowing very hard, and most other places were closed - but not Cozumel! Their staff stayed open and it ended up being the place to be that evening. 

If you like Mexican food I highly recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"What I was expected was pretty mediocre, Americanized-Mexican food, fast. And I mean, that's OK. Especially if that's what you came for. 

But this Cozumel location was much better than I was expecting! The margaritas weren't florescent, the salsa was fresh and whatever they put in that bean dip is pretty ridiculous. You like at it and you're like, \"There is no way I'm going to like that.\" Then you taste it and you're like, \"I've been a FOOL!\" It's that good. 

Once you've filled up with margaritas and chips, don't forget that you have a massive plate of entree coming your way in about 30 seconds. It's so fast. I tried taquitos for the first time in like... 12 years? I don't even know. I think the last time I had them they were defrosted from a box in the supermarket. Not these. Freshly prepared, deliciously seasoned and shredded chicken. So much good. 

Don't be surprised if you see me here a little too often."}
{"text":"First time at a Cozumel even though I've lived in the area for years.  I have another Mexican restaurant that I normally go to due to location, but I appreciated that Cozumel had a few other vegetarian items. I loved the vegetarian tacos!!!! The corn tortillas were soft and warm. The filling was perfect: avocados, onions, peppers, and potatoes.  I was with friends and we had a couple crazy kids with us. The server was accommodating and was quick to get us more crayons or more chips when needed."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. My guy and I share fajitas- as the portions are so gut busting large- and the service! Excellent!!! Every single time. Never had a bad experience here, food or service! Get a pitcher of sangria! It's a must!"}
{"text":"Cozumel is the Mexican Restaurant that all the others in Cleveland have to live up to.  I've been to just about all of them and Cozumel has NEVER been beat.  (The only one that was better has been closed for quite a few years now, Ernesto's, how I do miss his food.)

The service is prompt and the staff is delightful. The amount of food you get for the price is great. I'm always stuffed after half of the meal. 

You can judge how a Mexican restaurant is going to be by their salsa & chips...Cozumel's chips and salsa seems to be made fresh at all times.  Their standard salsa is great but ask for the Hot salsa, it's even better if you like hot.

If you're into refried beans, they are by far the BEST in Cleveland.  

The only, and I do mean ONLY, issue I've ever had is with their Chile Rellenos.  It's always very tasty but the pepper is over cooked."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, pretty typical mid-west Tex Mex.
-Complementary chips were good, salsa was mild and a bit fair
-Queso: okay, basically melted gooey cheese, no other spices or flavor
-Jumbo gold margarita: bland, weak, like poured out of a jug
-Maya special: steak, bacon strips under 3 lbs melted gooey cheese. Delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a tough critic meaning that I do not give a five-star review frivolously. But Cozumel is terrific in every respect.

I visited with a colleague who had eaten at Cozumel before. The fact that the parking lot was packed on a Wednesday night was a  good sign. Although they were busy, we did not have to wait to be seated. Service was prompt and punctual without being overbearing.

The food is fantastic starting with the chips and salsa which are definitely better than average. And after we finished one basket of chips, they brought us a second (not all restaurants will do that). I had the Super Enchiladas Rancheros. Beware of extremely large portion sizes. I wanted rice which did not come with this particular dish so I ordered it as a side. we are talking a LOT of food.

Prices are very reasonable. My dinner (including the side of rice) with a large iced tea came to $13 and change.

The place is rather noisy - or at least it was when I visited. So it might not be good for a quiet evening on \"date night\". Tastefully decorated but not stuffy or tacky. If you're looking for good Mexican food and great service, look no further; this is your place."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place almost every day since they opened bland I always meant to try it. I don't know why I waited this long. This place is great! Good food, salsa and chips, the atmosphere is great and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"They have delicious Guac and corn tomatoe dip ! I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were delicious ! 
Recommend. 

A tad overpriced , but other then that had a great ladies night!"}
{"text":"I am a Cozumel junkie. I love this place so much, it's my go-to when I don't feel like cooking. What's not to like? Cozumel is fairly inexpensive, super quick service and delicious Mexican food. I have been here so many times it's hard for me to recommend specific dishes but I can say I usually chose the enchiladas, fajitas or quesadillas. It's your typical Mexican joint and they serve many different combination platters, including an extensive vegetarian menu. After being seated you are automatically presented with fresh chips and salsa (oooo... hot tortilla chips...) and they are BOTTOMLESS. You don't have much time to fill up on them before your food is arriving. They are really fast! Cozumel also serve a big selection of Mexican beers and the margaritas are as big as your head.  

Tip: Don't be afraid to deviate from the normal and try their daily specials. We have never been less than pleased!"}
{"text":"Pulled in here for lunch, expecting it to be packed. Wasn't. 

Food is authentic-ish. Chips and salsa (lots of onion and cilantro) were ok, if not bland. Chile poblano was good, but not crisp. Fire burrito was not worth the $11 tag. It had some heat to it, but other than that, not memorable. Prices on the whole are average for the area. Serving size is on the ridiculous 'Merican size.

Service was pleasant, if not on the slow side. Restaurant was quite clean. 

Pay at the register (noted on the bill)."}
{"text":"The food was really basic and didn't have much flavor. Wasn't spicy at all. Very franchise feel and franchise quality food. I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for good Spanish/Mexican food."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious authentic Mexican food . Margaritas by the pitcher always flowing. Enthusiastic and engaging employees great service. Come here for a birthday and listen to these guys sing"}
{"text":"I was treated to lunch. Had the lunch special #10: chicken burrito and enchilada. Didn't expect the food to be filling but it was food nonetheless. I cleaned the plate. Place got very busy around lunch. If I'm ever in that area again I'll be sure to stop by for cheap eats."}
{"text":"Blech.  Hated this place.  The waiter was creepy, the food was boring and I felt a little sick after I left.  I've had way better meals at Taco Bell.....there was nothing even close to authentic about this place."}
{"text":"This place is on rotation for lunch with my co-workers when we feel like dinning out. Take this review with a grain of salt because I always get the same things, but they are soooo good! The Baja Fish Tacos and the Chile Poblano Rellano. Both are pretty tasty and I am very happy to have leftovers. Prices aren't bad and the wait staff seem pleasant enough."}
{"text":"The food was average. I've had much better Mexican in the Cleveland area. Service was below average. Four people dining and all meals came out separately. One meal was cold and had to be sent back. By the time all four of us had our meal two of us were finished. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This place is quick and delicious. The Mexican tacos are my favorite and it's hard for me to order anything else, however the three or so other entrees were also excellent. The vibe is just okay, kind of your standard Mexican restaurant. Would love to see a makeover but overall not necessary. I prefer the bar area when dining in."}
{"text":"Early Saturday night visit.  Place was busy when we arrived at 5:15, and was absolutely packed (with waiting lines) when we left at 7:00.  Apparently, this place is popular.

Food - good Mexican fare compared to other restaurants in the area, although I wouldn't say I ate anything that I haven't had just as good someplace else.  Chips were worm when brought to the table, and was replaced as soon as the baskets were empty.  Chimichangas were solid - the shredded beef was particularly good.

Service - relatively attentive and friendly.  Food was served fairly quickly considering how busy the place was.

This location is not close to home, so we won't likely be back, but a good spot nonetheless."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch. It was your average Mexican resturant. The food was pretty good as well as the chips and salsa. The waiter seemed really put out to have to deal with us though."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place in Lakewood! Service is great, prices are reasonable, and the food and drinks always satisfy our needs! 
I get the taco salad in a taco shell bowl every time we go and it's under $7. The food comes out about 5 minutes after placing the order- so fast! 
Chips and salsa arrive as soon as you get to the table.
I've been dying to try the fried ice cream but haven't yet. On my list for next time!!"}
{"text":"YUM!!  We went here for father's day with my father in law.  Though it was initially packed when we came in, we were seated within a reasonable time.  Th food was great.  They're home made guacamole stole my heart and their taco salad is scrumptious.   The service was quick and we were in and out in out feeling rushed.  i will go back/"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant.  Had a whole table of people and two pitchers of margaritas and the bill was less than $70.00  When I'm in the area, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"So we went in for a Mother's Day dinner. My food was fine, as was my husbands, but my sisters was not. She ordered fajitas. Her side plate with the guacamole, beans and rice came out first. Her meat came about 5 minutes later after the rest of us were well into our meals(she gave permission for us to start before her so we could eat warm food), she then had to request her tortillas. When those finally came she assembled her first portion, and her last. The meat was flavorless and she couldn't eat it. When she spoke to the waiter about it the response was the equivalent of go fuck yourself. She had to pay $14.99 for a meal she sent back. So my advice is if you want super average food and a big fuck you if you don't like your meal ,this is the spot. Also, there are a ton of turkey vultures circling overhead which we should have seen as an omen in retrospect. So folks, there are plenty of other places in that area, so I suggest going elsewhere. Happy Mother's Day to us!"}
{"text":"Cozumel still remains to be one of my favorite rsturants. Food is absolutely delicious and fairly priced. The one thing that appears evident  is some of  the wait staff seems highly disconnected with customer seevice. I have noticed this change with in the last year or so. The sheer greatness of the dishes keeps me coming back, despite the poor service."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends who love the place.  Basic Mexican decor.  This used to be a HoJo a long time ago.  Friendly server, attentive.  Love the warm chips and fresh salsa.  Margaritas are huge, but not very strong.  Portions are generous.  It seems like the fajitas are very good, but some of the other items, like the tamales, were very bland.  Not a bad place at all, and quite fun for large groups.  I would stick with the fajitas."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive Mexican that usually is served very fast. Great salsa too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great prices. Fast service. Go here often and would recommend to all! Rarely have to wait to be seated and always a pleasant trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I have become regulars of Cozumel.  The drinks are good. The Food is great. the prices are reasonable. The service sometimes is just so-so (usually because they are busy).  Tonight I had the shrimp fajitas for a change and it is as good as all the rest of the meals I've had there. They are close to Rte 77 and 480 which is a plus too (I stop on the way home for take-out sometimes).  Try them you won't be disappointed and I swear I'm not related or employed by them.  Just real glad to have some real good Mexican food close by."}
{"text":"I like getting my food fast, but I would rather have it good. 

With more and more Mexican places opening up nearby and with ones that have been operating for years, there is no excuse for going to get second, third or last best. I gave this place my \"three time try\" and they failed at every turn.

Every time I ordered my food, the entree came out right on top of the appetizer we ordered for the table. I honestly don't think that good meals can be properly prepared in under five minutes and that's about how fast the food comes out after you order it. 

The most disappointing aspect of the food is that is clearly microwaved or rapid grilled and the same sauce is applied to every single thing, be it a burrito, an enchilada or a chile relleno. Part of the great thing about Mexican food is the variety of succulent sauces that accompany each dish. They enhance the flavours of the meats or vegetables contained within that dish. There is absolutely no finesse in how this food is cooked. 

Seriously, do yourself a huge favour and truck down a couple miles to Villa y Zapata or Luchita's and get more bang for your buck. If you don't care about authenticity of the food (which if you return here, you obviously don't), head down to El Carnicero or Barrio, both of which are just about a mile from this joint. Both use quality ingredients and offer better flavours."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Mexican food until I have had Cozumels. I have been coming here for 7 years & everything is so delicious, their enchiladas are amazing as well as their super fresh shrimp/beef fajitas. The chips are to die for! Not only is their Mexican food good but the chicken tenders and fries are delicious. What I love is that they cook everything then and there, unlike commercial Mexican restaurants where everything taste blan. Everything is always so fresh here. 
If you are looking for something AUTHENTIC and QUICK with wonderful service then coming here is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Lakewood Couzmel's is the BEST out of all their locations. The food is always fresh, hot, and fast. The staff is great and makes sure you are pleased with your experience. The atmosphere is extremely clean and you feel like your in Couzmel! The margaritas are to die for- def a must get!  My personal favorite, polo con aros (chicken, cheese, and rice with a side or tortillas)"}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had anywhere, not exaggerating at all! Literally walked in ten minutes ago, was greeted within seconds with a smile, was seated within another twenty seconds even considering they're having their dinner rush. Was asked for drinks by our waitress within another 10-20 seconds. Got all three drinks (1 Dos Equis Lager, 2 Rasberry Lemonades) in less than two minutes. When she came back with our drinks she took our order: I have the seafood chimichanga and my girlfriend has two tacos a quesadilla and rice. We legitimately got the order brung out to us in less than ten minutes. Two people brought it out to us, than our waitress came and asked if it looked good. I questioned the freshness at first because of the speed but boy was I wrong, my plates hot and so is the food. Had to come write this. I've been here three times before and always had good service but boy have they gotten better."}
{"text":"You need more of their chilaquiles with salsa verde in your life.  All day, errryday!"}
{"text":"Good, Better, Best - Great - WONDERFUL - excellent food - excellent service - excellent all around.  I have nothing but good words for this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco De Mayo. Food was great a filling. The wait was longer than expected for the food but it was packed today. Normal wait time for food isn't long. Great authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I like to call this my fave Mexican restaurant in the #CLE area. The prices are super affordable and the drink specials and happy hour specials are wonderful. My fave dish is the Mexican tacos. They are a mix of steak and chroizo on a corn tortilla. Served with rice and beans. Last night, I discovered a new fun fave - the duo. Chicken and chorizo quesadilla served with rice and beans. Service is always on point and the wait even on busy days is never too long. The most I've ever had to wait is 15 minutes on a Saturday night. The margaritas are pretty awesome too. Try the pineapple which comes in a pineapple :)"}
{"text":"We have been going here for the last 8 years! We love the staff and have never once had a bad experience!!!Fast , friendly service! Picking up orders is also a great experience and super easy with their new app!and you always get free chips and salsa ! Even with take out orders!!"}
{"text":"You have to love the fact this is a former IHOP. We were sad to see it go, but Cozumel is a more than worthy replacement. I'm a big fan of their chile rellenos, especially in El Combo (which comes with a relleno, taco and a few other items). The margaritas are ok. I'm not a real fan of the rice here but that's generally across the board at all the local Cleveland Mexican restaurants, it looks pretty on the plate but tastes bland. Good salsa and chips when you sit down -- pretty sure the chips are made in house, or at least reheated there. The thing which sets this apart from some of the other Mexican places nearby is the art -- there's some really good contemporary art on the wall, and everything isn't THE BRIGHTEST COLOR YOUR EYES [CAN'T] STAND, so bonus points for decor."}
{"text":"Apparently I did not know that right thing to order here because their hard tacos were nothing compared to Riverwood and Merry Arts...It was cheap though and you get a ton of food...I did try the chicken soft tacos and those were really good...It could've been an off time too, a Sunday afternoon...I guess I'd be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"I returned to Cozumel's in Lakewood! This time I had Mexican tacos, filled with pieces of tender steak & chorizo, nestled in  doubled, soft corn tortillas. On the side, freshly diced onion & chopped cilantro, with lime wedge. With this dish, Mexican rice, and a \"must have\", frijoles charros. These are whole beans that are flavored with diced bacon....yum! Soo much better than those \"whipped beans\"! Shout out to our server, Juan, who made this visit more fun than the last, if that was possible. He was personable, friendly, & funny! I felt like we were cousins, Lol!  #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"So becoming a mostly plant based eater has allowed me to try some new establishments I normally wouldn't.  One of those has been Cozumel Mexican in independence.  I've been to a few of Cleveland's Cozumel's before and was not blown away, however this location is by far tops one among Cozumel and 2 among Mexican establishments.  
First, the salsa and chips are always hot and fresh.  The salsa itself has to be made fresh.  Perfect amounts of cilantro and fresh ingredients you can taste.  I have tried mostly veggie dishes all of which have been superb.  I have had a few seafood dishes (tacos, chimichanga, fajitas) and taste great well.  Staff is very friendly and on the ball.  I could eat here many times and keep it healthy, tasty and have great service.  
Can't wait to go back for the 10th time !"}
{"text":"I love Cozumel.  I have to say that I disagree with the review that calls this Americanized Mexican food.  This food is (IMO) way better then any Chi-Chis or Don Pablo's chain restaurant every could hope to be.  

I started out with the fajitas here and have slowly been working my way through the menu.  I have yet to have some thing that I didn't enjoy.  

I really enjoy the homemade salsa and Pico de gillo and they make some of the best queso that I have ever had.  

*TIP*  This location is closing when the 'New' location in Lakewood is up and running; so if you stop by and it is closed that is why."}
{"text":"Best salsa in the area. Food is fresh, and consistently good. We try to eat here several times a month."}
{"text":"Stopped in today on a whim. Haven't been here in years! First, I loved the individual salsa cups. The salsa it self was quite good! Chips were fresh and warm.
The vegetarian menu left a bit to be desired as the only stand out item was the veggie tacos.
They were good but lacking a little flavor.
The spinach queso fundido was very good!
I enjoyed the rather small but tasty chalupa.
Our waitress was very nice and the restaurant clean, spacious and well appointed."}
{"text":"Food was good.. after we ordered and received our food we never saw our server again. We had to ask a male server to grab us boxes and our check."}
{"text":"Service is super quick and efficient; margaritas are strong, chips are fresh and food is delicious... what more could you ask for? They've recently added a combination of my two favorite foods to create the \"Fajita Chimichanga\", which is just a chicken chimi with a ton of veggies like mushrooms, zucchinis and tomatoes in addition to the standard onions and peppers. Take out is ready within minutes and the patio is nice when the weather allows. If you're going to celebrate cinco de mayo, expect to wait a loooong time, it's essentially standing room only"}
{"text":"I've been several times w/my work crew - service is friendly & fast, everything is always clean, lunch specials are cheap ($6-$8, cheaper than Panera now) and I love the raspberry-mango margs. 

Cozumel has your typical Mexican-American fare: burritos, enchiladas, taco salads, etc. The salsa is fresh and although I've had a stale chip here and there, overall the quality is good for the price. The waiters are usually very good-humored and they never hassle us about splitting up the check. Three and a half stars!"}
{"text":"very bland food.. nothing special IMO.. everything kinda tastes the same...  doesn't seem very clean either.. wish it was better.. will not be back..  I do know people who like this place.. I cant understand why though"}
{"text":"So good! Your margaritas are always amazing. I love thequeso and your guaco is the best around town! Garlicy with red onions and tomatoes in it. I can't get enough. I got a steak quesadilla with peppers and mushrooms and I wanted another. Can't wait to come back!."}
{"text":"Gone was iHop before I even moved to Lakewood. However, my patience paid off. As one of the previous reviewer said, it looks like a run of the mill tex-mex, refried beans in your face type of place.
But with it's space being an decorated with \"international\" as the theme, it kinda weird walking in there smelling tex-mex food but your sixth sense tells you there's a double blueberry pancake to be had. (hey TB, a new kinda of chalupa?)
But the food is amazing. I asked for the hot salsa and they asked me if I was asking for the habanero salsa and I said yes. Lest to say, it was hot. If you read my other reviews, you know when I say it's hot, it's really hot. So save for a few of those out there who have lucifer's taste bud, beware of the concoction. 
The food is excellent. If this was run of the mill, it ran all over that mill wherever that is. The service is friendly and there's a lot of dishes to require multiple trips to savor them all.
In all consideration this is a must visit Lakewood business (yes, I know they have other locations too.)"}
{"text":"I've only been here to times so far and i have only ordered togo during lunch time so my review will only be for the food.

first time i came here i ordered the lunch #8 two chicken enchiladas for $7.95, even though their website shows it to be $8.25. it was pretty good and filling but i was sad it only came with rice and no beans.

the second time i came i ordered mexican tacos $10.25. it comes with 3 soft tacos filled with steak and homemade chorizo. i got this because i was craving street tacos. i was kind of disappointed in these tacos as they didnt really tasted like good street tacos at all (maybe because I am from california and i am picky).

i gave this place a 4 star because this place is good but not great."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was amazing!!! My fried ice cream was gorgeous and to live for!!"}
{"text":"They added valet parking which is nice since the restaurant is always busy!  We were seated immediately & the delicious salsa and chips arrived as soon as we sat down!  Tonight's dishes appeared to have been hurriedly slopped on the plates.  The beef taco salad I ordered was a shell filled with slop - runny melted mess of ingredients.  It was unappetizing looking and tasted even worse.  Barely edible. The Guadalajara Plate was as expected, although food dripped over the rim of the plate as it was set on the table.

My advice:  Slow down and pay attention to the appearance and quality of food."}
{"text":"Cozumel is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area. Very clean establishment with friendly staff. Food is always cooked to perfection and the margaritas are always tasty. The outdoor patio is a ideal for warm days during the spring, summer and fall. The bar area is equipped with large screen tvs and friendly bartenders. Cozumel is great for families or a date night."}
{"text":"I love the food but, this is the second time that they have been shady with my credit card. The first time we didn't lime what was ordered so they took it off my bill. When I received my bank statement it was put back on. I'm a restaurant owner that had to be re applied to the bill . The manager said it was an accident. OK YEAH RIGHT! 

Well I decided to go back just recently and the girl that cashed me out forgot to give me my credit card back. When I called and left a message they didn't call back. So I called them and she informed me she looked everywhere. I informed her that I never got it back from cashier. She took my info and never called me back. Now I have to cancel the card which is attached to some of my restaurant stuff. 

I would never use a credit card with them, they are sneaky and untrustworthy. SMH"}
{"text":"I have eaten at multiple Cozumel locations and NEVER have a varied experience. Completely consistent, always delicious and I try to order something different every time. This time I ordered a combo number 10(one chicken and one beef enchilada with rice & beans.) My girlfriend ordered a burrito supreme that had beef tips, ground beef and shredded chicken. Everything came out really quickly, they kept our salsa and chips full and our drinks were never emptied. Great experience."}
{"text":"Cozumel is your average Mexican joint: unlimited chips and salsa and combos, but what makes them stand out is the service! From the time we were seated we had chips and salsa at our table and menus. Our waiter promptly delivered our drinks, took our order, refilled our chips, and had our meals in front of us before we could ever start to wonder about where our food was! Excellent service, pretty good food for NE Ohio, and extremely inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Typical Ameri-mexi place.  They did a good job converting the old Ihop into a Mexican oasis.  People are always super nice and they take coupons.  Margaritas are kinda weak but the salsa is awesome and I can drink it.  A palabras de borracho, oídos de jicarero."}
{"text":"This place is going down the hill after my last visit.  If i want to be ignored for 45 minutes i stay at home.  I got up and left, never again!!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a while for a good mexican restaurant and this may be my new favorite. Since Mexican Village on Brookpark Road closed there has been a culinary void in my life. This place comes closer than anywhere else. The food is very good. The service is good and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the super burrito and it was a bit small, but tasted pretty good. It is very easy to find the place right off the 77 exit in Independence. I will be back many more times in the future. I would have given it 5 stars if the burrito was bigger."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the servers are always pleasant. Our favorite dish is the El Carmones Shrimp."}
{"text":"This is where it's at! Delicious margaritas with quality tequila, perfectly melted cheese dip, extremely flavorful entrees and authentic atmosphere! Winner in my book and I'm a Mexican food junky!"}
{"text":"First, it smelled like manure when we got out of the car right by the restaurant. Not very appetizing. I think they put down some new mulch or something and it was gross. The place inside was loud with TVs and various decorations. I thought their decor was lively and the seating was kind of tight/close together. They wanted to seat us (a party of 3) at a booth, but I felt like the table nearby was way too close for comfort.

I've had great Mexican food before in Mexico and on the West Coast so I can't agree this place is the best ever. Maybe this is as good as it gets in Ohio and that's fine. I'm a sucker for the chips and salsa...it's addicting. The salsa here fell flat. The chips were good and our waitress was attentive and kind. We did get our orders quick. I got the beef burrito combo with a beef taco. Their beans were good and I liked the taco mainly because it had extra toppings aside from just beef and a shell, but I wasn't impressed with anything else. The prices are a perk and the service was on point."}
{"text":"After getting seated right away, chips and salsa were brought to us on the spot! There's like...a designated chip guy. 
Quick service, great food! Classic Mexican (but for picky eaters they do have some American things) with a large menu!"}
{"text":"This place is very delicious and authentic! The margaritas were very good! Salsa and chips were very fresh and the chips were warm which I loved. I had the #1 Vegetarian platter which included one bean burrito, cheese enchilada and a tostada. It was sooo yummy! I got to take home leftovers too which was a plus! I can't wait to come back and order it again. :)

They were consistently busy the entire time we were there. That says a lot. We ordered a second margarita so we were hanging out for awhile after we ate. This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Lakewood. Sorry Barrio. This reminds me of the Mexican restaurants in LA which you know are the real deal. This is my new go-to spot! Stop in for happy hour -- it goes until 6pm."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Friday night just after 6 for a quick bite before a 7:30 show at Playhouse Square. We were hoping for fast service and were not disappointed. We were out of there in about 35 minutes! The guac was rather plain...needed lime juice, but the salsa was delicious and had a unique smoky flavor. My Baja tacos were amazing! Super crispy fish and creamy Mexican salsa...yum! The hubs thought his taquitos dinner was just okay...good, but nothing to write home about. Overall, great experience! We would come back."}
{"text":"Fun place to go with the family! Food is good, service is good and the price is right, They get you seated rather quickly even on busy nights. If your looking for Americanized Mexican  food, you'll like Cozumels."}
{"text":"Margeritas are greeaaaatt. Food is delicious. Does any one know if it is  a remodled IHOP cause it looks like it? But it was delicious I suggest the fajitas. Peace."}
{"text":"Everything a Mexican place should be. So delicious. Love the fajitas, perfect amount of spices and taste to the salsa! Have never been disappointed at Cozumel. Service can be slow even when the place is not crowded but it's worth it when you get a craving for some delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The food here is very solid, just say something spanish sounding and you get a yummy tortilla filled with either chicken pork or beef, with cheese sour cream and rice inside and a side of refried beans next to it. 

The service can be questionable at times but that's ok. Why you ask? because after you order a pitcher of margaritas on margarita night you may forget why you even came there. Try the peach, or the strawberry, maybe even the original it doesn't matter 2 glasses later you'll be feeling quite well."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't judge a book by its cover :) 

The patio was fairly crowded by 7:00 on a Wednesday, but there was no wait inside. Our server greeted us with a basket of chips and spicy salsa. Within minutes our pitcher of Cuervo Gold Margarita's arrived ($18). Most of the entrees ranged from $6 - $14. I would recommend getting the Cancun Burrito (I was skeptical by the name too). The beef was tender, guac and pico were fresh, and it was delicious! 

The kitchen staff was so fast! Our food was out under 10 minutes. The only complaint I had was there was a lot of rambunctious kids yelling the entire time, but I can't fault the restaurant for that. Can't wait to go back and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The service is always great and the food is excellent!  And how can you say \"no\" to those delicious, endless chips and salsa!  We typically split a fajita grande, solo pollo... it always leaves enough food for hubby to have lunch the next day.  Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Cozumel in Independence is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area.  This is a local chain of restaurants, and the only other one I've been to was in Brook Park, and I didn't like it as much.  At the Independence location, the margaritas are delicious and strong, the food is good, the staff is friendly, service is quick, and prices are cheap.  Not surprisingly, this place is a big hit for all the business people working in the corporate area of Independence."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last Saturday for dinner to celebrate my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend. The food was delicious and we got lots of it! Also our waitress was awesome and very personable (I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shoutout). Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and good prices try the chorizo queso dip it is amazing me and my wife will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"The food is always good! The service is fast, especially when you need lots of refills like me. The queso fundido con chorizo (chori queso) is one of my favorite appetizers there."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. The strawberry magaritas are awesome. I seen some of the other's comments about the magaritas and I'd have to disagree. We always get the Fajitas for two. Always hot and always fresh! Lot's of pork, chicken, steak and shrimp. We eat here once a week and we have never been disappointed! The fried ice cream to finish off the meal is perfect! Great place for a quick meal. the wait staff are very friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Lakewood, OH. to get mexican food and I'm a regular. Great prices, wait staff is friendly, and food is served fast. I disagree with the others that the food is not authentic. I order the fajitas and am pleased time and time again. Healthy, and fresh every time! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had lunch and dinner several times, quite tasty in general with the typical Mexican dishes.  Having lived a decade in Arizona, it's about as good as most family style Mexican restaurants I frequented in central Phoenix.   Tasty and authentic in my opinion.   Good selection of sea food dishes, good chips and salsa for starters, good drink selection."}
{"text":"Went here once for lunch on a weekday. 

Although there was only one other table occupied in the bar area where I was seated, I considered the service to be excellent.
I didn't have time to put my jacket on the seat before the waiter asked for drinks and had a bowl of chips (warm !) and salsa on our table. He then came back for multiple times through the meal to ask for drink refills. 

The ambiance was very nice where I sat in the bar area. 
The latin jazz was softly on in the background and the TVs volume [not obtrusively placed in the bar] was off. 

We ordered from the lunch menu ['Speedy Gonzales'] and received our food - freshly cooked in 15 minutes. 

Overall, the portion was a good size and tasty (#2 veggie, I think). They did not skimp on the guacamole either (a large spoonful)."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Lakewood, margaritas are wonderful, recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Honestly, my family and I have been going to Cozumel about once a week since they opened in Lakewood.  That pretty much says all you need to know."}
{"text":"WOW! I'm so surprised with how fast the service is here. I swear we ordered and ten minutes later, they brought the food. The chips were very fresh and the fire burrito was delicious as usual. If you like spicy, it's definitely the way to go. We had a pitcher of raspberry margaritas that were surprisingly strong. Two glasses and I was relatively tipsy! 
They give you very big portions so be prepared to take a box home!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner, but I had never been there until our cousin from Texas brought us there. Since she gets real Mexican food a lot, I was curious how she would rate Cozumel. She loved it, and we all loved it! The food was fantastic, the prices were great, and my son said it was the best burger he's ever had. I had the taco salad with chicken. Can't wait till next time!"}
{"text":"Carlos the waiter very attentive service and excellent food. And the divine margaritas!!!!"}
{"text":"First good Mexican meal I've had since I moved to Ohio from California (i.e. Good for the area, standard for Southern California). Kind, speedy service once seated. I knew I was going to be happy when they brought each of us our own salsa for our chips. As a vegetarian I appreciated the veggie menu items. Note: I liked the spinach enchilada more than the cheese. Way better than the other Cozumel locations (don't even consider the broadview location)."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Ohio!  I'm from Utah and I know some good Mexican food and this place is authentic.  It's clean,  the servers are awesome and friendly.  My favorites are the fajitas,  veggie tacos and salsa.  Fast service too.  They have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a small bar."}
{"text":"Three stars, but if I had to come back, I wouldn't mind.   The free chips and salsa were very good.  The chips were hot and the salsa was above average.   I got the flautas and they were tasty,  but very stingy with the guacamole.   I also got the Supreme quesadilla,  where's the meat?   I got two tiny pieces of chicken and the flavor was bland.   The Margarita was nice and strong.   If I do come back,  and I likely will,  I will picking anything but the quesadilla, and probably have a 4 star meal."}
{"text":"Wow! I've been in a lot of Mexican restaurants, but this is undoubtably the BEST I've ever had. No frozen/microwaved food here - just fresh & tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was a fabulous restuarant. Food was excellent, tasted fresh and delicious. The food came out in a timely manner. Salsa was superb!! The house salsa was very tasty, but not very spicy, so we ordered the hot salsa, and I was so excited that it was SPICY. Service was outstanding. Servers were very friendly and attentive. Decor was nice and restaurant was clean. I grew up 25+ years in California (and Mexican food is my favorite food outside my own cousine), so I have had great Mexican food, and this place is just as good. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Not only do I love Cozumel, but anyone whom I've ever brought there has raved about it as well.  I have a friend who flies in for one weekend a year, and we head to Cozumel each Saturday that she is in town.  It's a priority.

The meals are delicious and served in generous portions.  The beer list is thin.  The desserts are average.  The main"}
{"text":"One star for the food because once my party and I got our dishes they were great (at least the ones they didn't mess up or forget). 

HOWEVER: 

We waited 20 min for water. 
They messed up one of my friends orders (once for the main entree and once for the appetizer)
We waited 20 min for refill on chips and salsa. 
Zero apologies for the wait and mistakes. 
Also.
A group of employees cat called three of my female friends when they were on the way to the bathroom.

Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Not bad when it comes to generic Mexican family type restaurants. 

Plenty of parking even in Lakewood and a large patio for when it is nice. Service is pretty good. Food comes out quickly and accurately but is not always warm and is not the freshest. Menu is fairly large with number dishes which is pretty typical. Plenty of children for all those who like complimentary screaming and loud videos playing while eating."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with good quality food. Staff is always pleasant and nice, the portion sizes are perfect, and they pump the food out very quick to keep you on schedule. This is always a go to spot for me when I am in the area and craving Mexican. Their Salsa is very good too."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area!  The reason for the four stars instead of the five is because there have been too many times that I have been here when our server seemed less then interested in serving us.  While they are almost always quick and attentive, some need a bit more personality and a smileV
Anyways, the food is really great!  Each meal begins with warm chips and home made salsa.  Their salsa tastes fresh and is more heavy on the cilantro.  I really like how there is not huge chuncks of tomatoes or onions.  They have a wide array of chicken, seafood beef and vegetarian dishes.  My favorite meal to order is the Quesadilla Verde.  It is a tortilla stuffed with cheese, avacado, peppers, lettuce and I always add some beans in there.  As for an appetizer, the chorizo and queso dip is amazing.  Warm melted cheese and spanish sausage is served with warm tortillas for dipping.  Cozumel also has many margarita flavors and delicious cocktails."}
{"text":"Our go to for Mexican. Photo of burrito a la diabla. Grilled chicken and chrizzo in a spicy sauce with melted cheese. Pictured with double rice instead of beans. Love it!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Cozumel's at Independence and Broadview Hts.  On this occasion, there must have been a language barrier but I received a Modelo in the bottle when I specifically mentioned I wanted Model draft in 16oz size.  Not the end of the world but two of us had fajitas.  They must have burnt a whole batch because both of ours were heaping portions filled with mostly meat that had a burnt aftertaste.  We could hardly eat it and the server was shocked when we didn't want doggy bags.  I wouldn't feed that to my dogs!  Maybe just an off night but you just can't serve people food you wouldn't serve to friends and family!"}
{"text":"I usually eat Mexican at Cozumel in Broadview Hts.  It is my favorite place in fact which dismays me because the Independence location is consistently better!  The food is ready faster, the salsa is more consistently good and the dishes themselves are better.  Take something as simple as Taco's.  Here they have more meat and served on a metal taco plate that keeps them upright.  The chips are out of a warmer.  The improvements are all in the details but seem to be better in all regards.  I will probably have to drive down to Independence from Broadview Hts from now on."}
{"text":"I don't suggest this place at all.  Very bad parking situation.  You can't self-park your car safely.  Mandatory \"complementary\" valet only.  Jumbo margaritas are medium sized and overpriced.  So-called coupons are not accepted ... we gave them a coupon and they told us it was \"too late.\"  Side portion of black beans was very, very small; a joke, really.  Take a pass..... not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food - quick & inexpensive. Favorite? Carnitas. Can't go wrong, big enough to split (ask for corn tortillas). Guac is pretty darn good and fresh but the homemade salsas are great (especially the tomatillo salsa if you like it hot, or the verde/green if you like it a bit more mild but flavorful). Tamales, tacos and combo platters are pretty standard fare but good. Service is always good or great. Americanized? Sure. But for what it is, this place is great. Don't forget the margarita on the rocks, Modelo (Negro of course) or Jarritos Tamarindo bottle to round it out."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and they delivered warm tortilla chips and salsa at the same time. The salsa has cilantro in it which I do that care for, otherwise it was good. I had the lunch specials which was one beef and bean burrito, one beef and bean taco and rice. The rice was excellent. The burrito was good and so was the taco. My one complaint was that the taco rested on the hot rice which made the taco shell soggy. I think it was about $6 for the lunch special. It was a good sized portion and it satisfied. The restaurant was clean but showed some signs of wear or neglect as the booth seat we had was torn. The service was fast. All in all it was good. Now wow, but good and worth the price."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Mexican food, I was looking for a place to call my go-to for good Mexican food. I frequent this place often and usually go for their fajitas or quesadillas. They have wonderful margaritas and the service is wonderful. We get our food very quick! The best part is their salsa. It's just right in so many ways. Pair it with their warm chips and you are good to go."}
{"text":"Sangria tastes syrupy like it was a thick drink mix. Melted ice cubes were forming a layer of water on top of drink. Waiter made mistake with order (which happens). Almost wish I would have stuck with wrong order because cheese enchilada was disgusting. Tasted like soupy American cheese. Still shuddering. Waiter brought check before asking if we wanted anything else- we wanted dessert. Should have passed. Sopapillas were super greasy. Rice and beans were okay. Quesadillas lacked enough cheese to keep sides of tortilla and filling together."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant around town. The service is fast and friendly although during peak times it can be a long wait for a table. Chicken fajitas and pollo con arroz are personal favorites!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican restaurant with good variety on menu.  Service has always been quick & friendly.  

Location on pearl in Brunswick is easy to access from Strongsville or Medina."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, attentive staff, welcoming business . Drinks ok not strong though"}
{"text":"We have been to Cozumel many many times since it opened. We probably average a visit at least every two weeks and occasionally once a week depending on the time of year. The food I would say is average to sightly better than average for most Mexican restaurants but the service is great even when they are busy which is quite frequently and food is always hot and I think it is a good value. We love Cozumel. It is our favorite Mexican restaurant. I would give the food 3 stars and the service 5 stars for an average of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a weekend luncheon. It was maybe 1:00.  Parking lot was sparsely populated.
It took a minute or two for someone to show up at the hostess station to seat us. 
A quick caveat, the booth seats are NOT attached to the walls as is typical, so get prepared for a ride if you try to slide out or scoot towards or away from the table as the booth will likely accompany you!
I got the #8 combination plate, a beef taco and a beef burrito with rice and beans.  My wife got shrimp fajitas.  Our waiter was a happy polite and efficient fellow, and all the staff seemed to be particularly happy.  
One fellow felt compelled to sing along to the mariachi music playing on the sound system and by sing I mean bellowing fortissimo!
That wasn't especially welcomed by my wife's migraine, and was definitely something more suited to an empty dining room over one which held patrons.  I was tickled that he was so joyful that he was compelled to sing, and if he had a volume control or mute button would largely have enjoyed it had the headache not been present.
The food was quite good.  The requisite chips were served warm, and the salsa was fresh and homemade. 
We were both quite satisfied with our entrees.  My wife felt hers was one of the best Mexican entrees she had been served anywhere, including her time in San Diego. She was particularly impressed by the correctly prepared shrimp...something quite hard to find anywhere. 
The iced tea was fresh-brewed and strong enough that one actually knew one was drinking  tea rather than colored water.  
The rice and beans were not quite as devoid of flavor as is typical, but certainly still not comment worthy"}
{"text":"Hmm, well, I have been prompted by friends to go here so I did...on a really hot summer's eve before taking in a flick at Brunswicks Hickory Ridge theatre's...And.....the jury is out.  
 Let's start with the service. We had trouble getting attention and being attended to. Not shabby mind you, just irksome.  Wasn't a large crowd, but, we weren't kept in mind it seems. We were always flagging our server down to get basic service.
  Outside seating was nice on a quaint but adequate wood patio. It is west facing so the sun toasts you if it is hot out. (And it was).
   So, the food:.....Not bad, not great. We found the menu selections interesting and not too pricey. When delivered, it was typical, and a bit overcooked. It is getting to be a trend at restaurants these days it seems. The kitchen service doesn't give their efforts the level of expertise that it should...are they expertly trained?, I often wonder.
  Mexican in our nation outside of the southwest and California isn't created very well.  By and large, Americans dont' get to experience really good Mexican food, and Mexican cuisine- one of my favorites- is very, very good when done right. Something you want to enjoy over and over. It all has become generic and redundant and we found it so here as well.  Again, not bad, just not good.  
Would I eat here again?  Yes, I would give it another try. While not put off in any way..I want and expect more. Better quality, better prep, better service. It's all got to be there.   I'll keep you posted whenever I make it back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite local Mexican place in all of Cleveland. Service is crazy fast, food comes out almost instantly, and for the price, you get a huge plateful of food that leaves me with at least two meals. Make it here for a happy hour session and you may have found heaven on earth. Drinks aren't the cheapest around, but happy hour makes it tolerable. 

Since I am always indecisive about whether I want a fajita plate or a quesadilla, I was thrilled to find out that a fajita quesadilla exists. This monster of a tortilla is packed full of your meat, peppers, onions, and a serious amount of cheese. A side of guacamole, sour cream, and rice makes this a fantastic meal. I can never finish the entire thing (might explode if I did), so I always plan on taking some home. Throw some eggs on the griddle in the morning with the leftovers and thank me later!"}
{"text":"It's time for my annual Cozumel review.  I just wanted to write and say that Cozumel is still serving fast, fresh, and delicious American Mexican food.  I have lost track of the number of times I've eaten here, but suffice it to say, I'm a regular.

I've been making an honest effort to try everything on their menu.  Everything has been good so far.  My favorite dish is the Fajita Grande.  I also really like their quesadillas, burritos, and margaritas.  Recently, I ate a veggie quesadilla and it was tasty.  I also tried the chile poblano rellenos, pollo con crema, pollo loco, and tamales.  Surprisingly, I didn't like the tamales all that much.  They just seemed to lack flavor.  I still love Cozumel's food overall, however.

This particular location has a parking problem on busy nights and now they offer free valet parking.  My suggestion is simply to move the restaurant somewhere else instead of fighting with the neighboring hotel over parking.  I'll probably just park in the neighboring bowling alley, if Cozumel is busy from now on."}
{"text":"I haven't visited this Cozumel location in about seven years, so it is time for an update. We stopped in recently with 14 people and we had to wait a bit to be seated on a busy night. We were seated after about 20 minutes - not bad! After we were seated, the server started pumping out the chips and salsa. The five kids we had with us polished off at three and a half bowls of chips! Amazingly, the waiter must have noticed this because the moment a bowl was emptied a hot bowl of chips was being passed down the long table to the kids.

He was a friendly server and kept our drinks full. They brought us a pitcher of water, which was great. But the tap water isn't filtered. They should filter the water so it has no impurities, which I can taste.

I ordered the fajita chicken bowl and it was very tasty. I don't need to carbs from fajita wraps, so I usually just order a bowl. The quality of the food was very good and seemed to be on par with the other Cozumels that I've been eating at.

I am happy to report that Cozumel is still my favorite Mexican restaurant chain in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Okay, it's time for another Cozumel review.  So I've been eating at Cozumel for about a decade and during that time, they have expanded.  Terrific.  I have always eaten at the Cozumel in Broadview Heights, which is still the best one to visit.  However, since this location is much closer to home, it has become our Mexican crutch.

Now, Cozumel has the best fajitas in Cleveland, imo.  And the fajitas with a large frozen margarita is one of my favorite meals of all time.  However, I've been trying to 'diversify' and see what other treats I may fall in love with.  So I've been stepping outside of my VERY comfortable fajita-comfort-zone!  Unfortunately, I haven't found one thing on the menu that I truly love as much as their fajitas.  I'm still looking though and I certainly eat here often enough to try the entire menu.

This location is usually quiet with few patrons."}
{"text":"The food comes out fast and is priced right. Have had multiple good experiences because of the staff."}
{"text":"Honestly, I haven't found a GREAT Mexican restaurant in Cleveland. The food is edible and the salsa has a slight kick to it and the queso is fine. Not many options on the menu. It is, at best, just okay but I am Mexican. So, I guess, you can say I have a slight bias."}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant we tried for lunch on a whim. Fast service, decent food and strong Coronaritas are great compliments!"}
{"text":"Love the salsa, great service, great tacos! Can't go wrong with this place and they always have a coupon in Valpak!"}
{"text":"Like Mexican? Live near Independence? Go. To. Cozumel! 
The salsa is always nice; a cool, smooth, fresh tomato salsa with plenty of garlic, a little bit of heat, and just the right amount of cilantro.
There's plenty of choices for meat eaters, vegetarians, and pescatarians alike. Some like it hot, some not. Personally, I like it a bit spicy. That's why my go-to dish is the burrito al a diabla. It's chorizo and chicken in a burrito, smothered in cheese sauce. And you get your standard Mexican rice on the side, but also charro beans. Smoky, spicy, full of flavor, these are a great rendition of beans! 
The choices go on and on, lunch and dinner specials vary daily. Desserts are typical, I usually go for the fried ice cream. I know it's just a ball of ice cream, rolled in corn flakes, frozen sub zero, and flash fried. But it's soooo addicting! 
Oh yeah, and if you like real cane sugar soda, get a Mexican coke, or any of the Jarritos pops. 
My only negative here is that I swear there's never an hour that goes by without it being someone's birthday. The awful off-key singing, the embarrassed sombrero-wearing birthday diner, and the laughs of their loved ones gets a bit annoying. But hey, that's what large margaritas are for, right?!"}
{"text":"I have been watching the conversion of the long shuttered IHOP into Cozumel for the last several months, and from the outside, it appeared to have been ready to go for the last several weeks.  I was excited to drive by this past Monday and see that it had opened, and made a point to get in as soon as possible.  It seems like the rest of Lakewood had exactly the same idea because the place was packed.  Luckily, even though they were busy, the turnaround was relatively quick, and we were seated within ten minutes.

The menu is pretty standard Mexican fare - tacos, burritos, tamales, combinations, a la carte, etc. you know the drill.  Everything we ordered was great.  The guacamole was fresh, and everything in the Guadalajara Especial (which was basically everything on the menu) was delicious.  The wife was very happy her enchiladas, taco, and rice, and at the end of dinner we were both stuffed and taking some leftovers home.

The host and servers were exceedingly friendly.  They might have been a bit more attentive, but I'll give them a pass since it was the first weekend dinner rush ever for them.  We didn't get the cheese dip we ordered (which is probably for the best considering how full we were)  but our server apologized and made sure that we weren't charged for it. 

Cozumel is pretty much exactly what I expected, and everything I hoped it would be, which is to say good mexican food, that's not too expensive, and in a convenient location.  I didn't really find a qualitative difference between other Mex places in town and the menu didn't have anything that caught my eye as unique, but even so, Cozumel is a solid place to eat, even if it's not necessarily a destination restaurant.  The score is weighted by the fact that they are a two minute walk from home, so if you live in Lakewood, definitely check them out."}
{"text":"The service was terrible! Our waiter kept walking past us, took our order, which he got wrong - and then passed our table off to another server without telling us. I ordered the lunch fajitas - which I pointed to on the menu, and also specified lunch fajitas. When my bill came, they charged me for the full size of fajitas, I asked to speak to the manager and he asked if I had consumed the food. I showed him my dish and told him I didn't even eat half of it, he told me since I consumed it they couldn't fix my bill. But first he acknowledged IT WAA THEIR MISTAKE, but I still had to pay. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Travelling here on business I thought I would stop by for dinner to see what Mexican food tastes like in Ohio. Having lived in Texas for the past 8 years I guess I am spoiled. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. The flour tortillas where a little hard and the food lacked taste. I was surprised since it came with a lot of vegetables on the sizzling platter but for some reason they lacked taste. Chips and salsa were also average. Service was average to good. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad. I just think it only deserves 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been to this location, I use to frequent this location often until I moved. But the food is still as delicious as I remember! The salsa was tasty and service was friendly and on top of things!"}
{"text":"If your craving some americanized mexican food this is the place to go. This restaurant is consistently good and their service is lightening fast. I usually get the lunch special with a chicken enchilada and a chicken burrito. I don't know what it is about their chicken but its always the perfect tenderness. The salsa and chips that they serve are addicting as well. I don't know what they do to the salsa but I wish I could make mine as good as theirs. Its the perfect amount of spice and taste of cilantro and tomato. I really like the smooth vs chunky consistency as well. This is one of my go to lunch spots when I'm craving something filling and without spending too much money."}
{"text":"We have eaten at another location of Cozumel  and really liked the service and the food. 
However at this location we were not impressed with the service. I asked for one cheese enchilada with the sauce, etc on the side - it all came piled on top of one another and there was definitely too much hot sauce which detracted from the enchilada."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice in Lakewood and once in Independence I've ordered three different dishes each time and each time was a funtastic (It's spelled correctly) and scrumptious time. The Independence location is definitely more lively and much busier so if you're treating Granny to dinner I'd opt for their  Lakewood location. Drinks are always strong WHOOP WHOOP and the servers are always super friendly. I  Cozumel!"}
{"text":"My friend dragged me to Cozumel for lunch. I didn't want to go. They are fast and efficient for lunch service. A server carries around a Tupperware pitcher of salsa and pour refills instead of bringing small little salsa dishes out. That was the most impressive part of the meal. There are not many ethnic food options in the office-hell-wasteland of Independence, Ohio so Cozumel does serve purpose."}
{"text":"I had an enchilada and a chicken and bean burrito. The portions were typical Mexican food, huge and filling. It was pretty standard and good. I am glad that it is no longer an IHOP. My best friend and I celebrated my 29th birthday here today, so I didn't have to pay. I would not have minded as the prices are cheap. I am still very full. I love eating Mexican food because it releases happy endorphins in my brain from the capsaicin."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at Cozumel's on numerous occasions and between their selection of drinks and the quality of their food we have no complaints. The solution of a 4 star review is solely on a personal opinion in that I believe Mole of some variation should be on the menu. While they did have a Mole sauce that could be added to a dish, there is nothing quite like having your meat of choice stew in a good Mole.
 
With that said, our experience there was enchanced due to the effort and kindness of our waitress as well as the kitchen staff present at the time of this review. You could taste their hardwork as the sauces coated the meat in savory and tantalizing flavor. For once in my life I actually cleaned my plate. It was such a pleasing meal between the Empanada Rojas in its savory sweet sauce and the rice, lettuce, guac and tomato that filled the rest of the plate. While the empanadas were flavorful by themselves, adding each of the additional flavors encouraged the flavors to blend together as your taste buds are met with sweet, savory, and the pallete cleansing flavor of the guacamole.

If you do not stop at this institution you are sorely missing out as their Pina Colada and Margheritas are made expertly by the bartenders on staff. I hope if you are in the area that you give it a chance. It is an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"Great value. Great food. Great service. For details, see other reviews."}
{"text":"If you love good authentic Mexican food- this is the place for you! This is definitely one of my favorite sit-down Mexican restaurants. The service is incredibly fast, especially for how many people are usually in the store at all times! The staff is so friendly and make sure that you are having the best dining experience possible. For how much food you get with each meal, the prices are rather reasonable and during certain times of the day there are amazing specials for the drink menu."}
{"text":"Cozumel has great queso, and a wide variety of options. They have plenty of options for fajitas, quesadillas, burritos and enchiladas. The staff is very friendly is able to accommodate large groups of people and usually has drink specials. Their combos are a good go to. Their patio is very pleasant during the summer months."}
{"text":"Loved the food much better then the Cleveland hood food on Lorain and west 117th .
Took my children and it wasn't even that expensive 
Thanks we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Food is very good and portions are very large. Good bang for your buck. Nothing super special, but it's nice when you just want some good solid Mexican food. Oh, their chips are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's our go-to Mexican restaurant. There are better places for sure, but the service is great, the food is great, the prices are great, and there are lots of options on the menu. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delicious steak soft tacos! Went to take my little cousin out for tacos and he wanted a sit down food joint. Low and behold our bro lunch date turned in my favorite place to eat soft tacos at! The wait staff was always diligent on refilling our beverages and the salsa bowls. Price wasn't bad, ended up being a 20$ bill with tip for lunch for 6 tacos and queso dip for two people . Comparing it to chipotle... Way stinkin better, fresher, and the salsa/chips was icing on the Mexican cake! Next time you want Mexican for lunch spring for the extra couple dollars and go chomp on some steak tacos!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the Cleveland area! 

You can never go wrong with grilled chicken tacos. Sometimes when I am feeling a little crazy I will get a side of rice and beans too.

The staff is always extremely friendly and you generally wait no longer than 10 minutes for your piping hot food to arrive at the table.

I will say I go here quite often and I haven't found Mexican as good as this anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Food: burrito supreme - it was good. Lots of flavor, had all three types of meat, beef, chicken and steak.  Wife had the steak burrito - she thought it was very good! The meat was good. Wasn't dry and was filling. Could have used some  pico de gallo on top. She'll have it again. 

Feel: fun and inviting atmosphere. It's your fun style Mexican place. Has an outside patio but didn't sit out there cuz of the chill that day. But it looks really cool. Has a medium size bar that would be a good quick spot on night too. 

Price: the usual for Mexican food. Nothing out of control."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food.  I know this is probably not what people from Mexico actually eat on a regular basis, but boy do I love the kind of food they serve at Cozumel and the 25 other Cleveland area Mexican restaurants like it. 

We showed up with 8 people on a Friday  night at 7:30 and they were able to seat us right away. That was a nice surprise to start off the evening.  

To start, I really did like their salsa. Nice and tangy. Great with a few (or a lot) drops of hot sauce mixed in.  
I got the mixed fajitas (chicken and beef). There was a ton of food. I could have stopped after one fajita, but who does that? I took the rest home and had a wonderful lunch today. 
Husband got the chicken tacos off the ala carte menu, very nice! He ordered 3, but probably only needed two.

This place is a great bargain. SO much food for $33 for two of us, tip included. The only reason I knocked off a star is for service. The water and pop glasses stayed empty too long (not convenient when eating spicy things) and there was a long lag between the times they stopped in to check and see if we needed anything. Other than that though, I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was the first great weather Friday of the year and we decided some tacos sounded good. We wanted to go to another restaurant but the wait was way too long. 
Came here instead and was pleasantly surprised. 
The salsa is good. Portion sizes are great. 
I had the fajita quesadilla and it was pretty tasty! Although the other reviews are right, this is Americanized Mexican food... but sometimes, that's what you want! and sometimes that stuff just hits the spot. The hubs had the fire burrito and he really enjoyed that as well. We both came home with at least a meal worth of leftovers and we got there hungry. 
We also tried the margs and they didn't skimp on the tequila, that's for sure. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Cozumel at least a half dozen times and I think it's always been with my coworkers. While it's not my favorite Mexican spot in Cleveland, I've enjoyed my experiences there and have no problem going for a happy hour or quick lunch. 

My favorite dish so far has been the Baja tacos, which come with crispy fish, a cabbage slaw, guac, and a sweet spicy red sauce. I've also had their choripollo and fajitas...all average but good! 

Their chips have always been hot and crispy, and I like that everyone gets their own salsa bowl. The salsa had a good balance of cilantro and spice. 

The service has always been quick and friendly, and this place definitely fills up quickly during peak hours!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently moved out to the Northfield area, so we were looking for a decent restaurant between both of us to catch up at. I suggested Cozumel because of the yelp rating (and I could basically eat Mexican food for every meal 365). honestly, food-wise - I'm glad I did... but when it comes to other aspects, I may hold off on coming here next time. 

The fresh chips (at least warm to seem fresh) and salsa are delicious. I mean, the salsa is REALLY good! They come around with a pitcher to refill your bowls and I almost asked him to just leave the pitcher and grab me a glass. SO good. I opted for the vegetarian combo #5 - a stuffed poblano pepper and a cheese enchilada, with rice and beans on the side. I was happy with the food- very comparable to food I've gotten from Si Senor. I wouldn't say it's the best food ever, but it's good and curbs my mexican food craving. Their regular marg is good, too. You can taste the tequila which is good - I hate wondering if it's literally just mix/fruit juice. But, it didn't seem fresh- one of those sugary mix tasting ones. 

The service was sub-par. The food came out very fast, don't get me wrong. (Not sure how fast the marg came out, my friend had it waiting for me when I got there). But, we barely ever saw our waiter except when he came to take our orders and drop off the check. I had to flag him down for more salsa (and he grabbed the guy with the pitcher). Similar to many other Mexican joints in the area, you pay at the front. We asked the girl to split the check, and she literally randomly split it. We told her we wanted it down the middle, but she looked confused so we just paid whatever she split it as. A few days later I checked my credit card, and I had been charged both amounts. My friend looked at her statement and she hadn't been charged and it was indeed my visa she had signed for (she knew right away bc she had handed the girl a MasterCard). We're not sure how she even managed to do that since she handed my card back first then \"ran\" my friends card before handing it back with the receipt. Weird- I didn't mind paying the full bill as long as they didn't try to double charge us.. Just weird since we can't figure out what happened- just be careful with how they run cards, I guess.

The parking - oh my goodness I HATE THE PARKING. I almost turned around and went home b/c I was so darn frustrated! First of all, it's all one way streets and one of the streets goes the opposite way, so you'll inevitably end up in front of someone with no room to go around them. Second of all, there is not enough parking at all and most of the available parking is the hotel's (behind the restaurant) spots. A few of us cars were told we would be towed if we stayed there and when I asked where to park, I was told to park at the bowling alley. It was still cold and Icey out and the girl walking down the slope to the Mexican restaurant literally almost wiped out. Not a good way to say \"welcome to my restaurant, we would love to have you\".

But... Despite all the issues, like I said- food was good. For me, I think other places offer similar food with no hassle, so I likely won't be back"}
{"text":"One of my go-to Mexican joints around town. The food quality is very consistent and it comes out FAST! Their sizzling fajitas are really good, but I usually order the Burrito de la Roqueta...it's a carnitas (pulled pork) burrito covered in gooey cheese sauce..so good!  Their fresh salsa and warm tortilla chips are top notch!

The margaritas are potent and beers frosty and cold. The employees are always very friendly and make you feel welcome.

Stop in hungry and you'll leave satisfied."}

{"text":"Mmmmm! Delicious salsa! And the chef whipped up shrimp ceviche for me even though it's not on the menu. Thank you for accomodating me, and presenting the most beautiful ceviche! Yay!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican food. Not bad. Not spectacular. Good atmosphere. They leave you to yourself and are quick. Pretty run of the mill neighborhood mexican joint."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just me but the food didn't have any taste or spice to it. I have had better at Taco Bell. Had I known the food was gonna taste like that , I wouldn't have driven past 2 Taco bells to get here. Waste of my gas, mileage, time, and money!

PS: Wait time was OK and the waitress was awesome just not the food lol!"}
