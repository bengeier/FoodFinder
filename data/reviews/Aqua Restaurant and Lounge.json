{"text":"Chinese mafia? I don't know... seems like the type of place.  I came here for a friend's bday thing. Plenty of space and lots of karaoke room. It's kinda an Asian divey place in my opinion, but if the mood fits, why the hell not indulge in that type of ambiance.  Staff seemed nice though so that's a plus. They were very accommodating to the party and knew how to have fun. Would I return? Ionno... I'd personally be too scared."}
{"text":"Thank you to the staff and servers for another outstanding night at CES for Lenovo the crowd is hugh and yet you make it a point to services everyone.   Food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. Have fun young ppl around.   Great appetizers. Salt and Pepper Chicken Joints are so good."}
{"text":"2.5 hours of karaoke, 2 buckets of beers (12), 1 order of french fries, 4 people, auto gratuity(!) = $175  Way too expensive for a private karaoke room. On a Saturday night, no one else was in the bar when we got there and no one was there when we left. I'm not sure how this place stays in business."}
