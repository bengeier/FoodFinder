{"text":"Great atmosphere, great latte. In the morning, the light shines through the windows - it's perfect for conversations and reading!"}
{"text":"Tremendous coffee in a great location. Just what this stretch of Penn Ave. needed!"}
{"text":"Lovely shop, kind of new to the coffee scene here (2013), and one of my main haunts. While Espresso a Mano down the street is bustling, Constellation does equally good coffee (which is no small feat) in a quieter, calmer space. Good selection of beans from Ceremony Roasters on Chemex. Super friendly too."}
{"text":"Constellation is some of the best cafe's in pittsburgh run by some of the kindest most skilled baristas. my daily dose of crack & chat"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere that makes you want to read or talk or think. Even better coffee. There's a back room with a big table, a few two-seater tables in the front, and a bar if you're the kind of person who likes to know everything that is happening in the neighborhood. They won't disappoint.  If you don't have at least one arm tattooed, though, they'll know you're not from the neighborhood."}
{"text":"SO delicious. Really good coffee, so rich and many options to choose from. Love the minimalist design inside and everyone is really friendly!"}
{"text":"As an infrequent visitor of the Pittsburgh area, I only just made it over to Main&Penn last week. My go-to beverage is an Almond milk Cortado, and this was probably the best I've ever had. Espresso was expertly chosen and pulled. Served in the traditional gibralter, it exceeded my high expectations. Only one barista, a super sweet young lady with dark hair and excellent service. She handled about 5 customers simultaneously and still managed a beautiful Rosetta in my non-dairy drink.  The atmosphere was quiet and calm, very trendy digs. Definitely a great reading or working environment, big tables in the back and light seating options in the front. Lots of natural light. It's a quiet little coffee shop dedicated to the craft. They also have Ceremony coffee, their Annapolis based roaster, available for sale. Minimalist certainly, they do what they do incredibly well. If you're in Lawrenceville and you have a taste for coffee, you absolutely must stop in."}
{"text":"Really lovely coffee shop in Lawrenceville. If you're into people watching, this is the spot for man buns and beards. Constellation has a Brooklyn-hip vibe without any pretentiousness. Coffee is always high quality and made well!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. The coffee is extremely good, with lots of information about each variety of bean, and the owner is friendly, laid back, and knowledgable.  I signed up for a Yelp account just to share how much I love Constellation!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. Aside from the amazing coffee and pastries from three fifty bakery, the atmosphere is calm and welcoming. Even when it's busy, it doesn't feel over-crowded, which is my biggest complaint about coffee shops in Pittsburgh. (They actually have space between tables, what!?) It's my go to spot when I'm meeting someone to catch up."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the few negative reviews Constellation has gotten - and I hate to try and set the record straight and see it become uninhabitably busy like some of the unbearable (and not just because of business) Butler St. cafés. I feel addicted to Constellation's coffee in particular more than just to coffee in general, sure it's $3 for a large (with tax) but it is so drinkable - I feel like soon I'm going to start doubling up. The space is open. You can breathe - you get a wonderful mix of clientel - all kinds of hipster, not just rich-hipsters, and even some hospital workers, and accidentally hip Pitt grad-students. The pastries are excellent and priced rightly. And people are social but not in a way that keeps anyone from getting work done."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh. I usually get a cappuccino and its consistently excellent. The coffee is also very good. It's quiet and less crowded than other coffee shops in the area, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I would recommend this coffee shop to anyone in the Lawrenceville area!"}
{"text":"This place is so close on everything. The space is cute, but the furniture doesn't quite work. The coffee is good, but not great.   I will say the owner is SUPER friendly and nice. I wish her well and hope the shop succeeds."}
{"text":"Without question, some of the best espresso in the city (if not the absolute best). Not to mention dirt cheap, and with incredibly friendly service. How this place only has 4.5 stars is beyond me."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here is amazing! There is usually an open table to work at or chat with friends.   I love their special flavored latte but also wish that they had more flavors to choose from! The owner is very friendly.  Not only that but I love that it is right on the bus route! So awesome!"}
{"text":"I will start off to say that I haven't been here enough to honestly judge their coffees, so I will have to update my review after a few more visits.   Based off atmosphere alone - I love it. The design is very minimalist, lots of woods, and just simple. It feels fresh and clean. The barista was very friendly when I order and when she brought my coffee.   I came on a weekday afternoon and it was surprisingly a lot more busy that I would have imagined. I was able to snag a seat in the back room at a large, shared table. It was really quiet and peaceful - great place to just have a nice cup of coffee, relax, study, or just do what you do. Utilize the free Wi-Fi.  I will say that I should have read these reviews before coming, else I would have gotten myself a nice maple syrup latte - add that to the 'to-do' list!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere has been mentioned before but I think it needs to be stressed. Do not come here if you are planning on having a good heart-to-heart with a friend. Unless you have no problem disturbing the rather intense peace of the rest of the customers slaving away on their laptops. Constellation is strictly a work environment. I know this now and will trade my chatty friend for my more reliable backpack full of textbooks when I return.   Besides the unexpected vibe, I was really impressed with the space. It is very charming and the man behind the counter only adds to this theme. He was patient and tried to help two very indecisive ladies pick drinks. I got tea so I cannot attest to the coffee.   We also didn't realize it closed at 6 and stayed a few minutes over, but they didn't give us the stank eye or rush us out the door. Honestly, I'd come back just for the outstanding service."}
{"text":"Holy Hipster, Batman. I consider myself a self-aware semi-hipster and I was super intimidated by the sheer hipsterness of their clientele. That said, you can usually tell a good third-wave coffee place by both the quantity and quality of the hipsters present and this place delivered. The shot I got was bitter and acidic on small sips, but with bigger sips the flavors blended perfectly and the coffee was very clean tasting and refreshing. The bitterness and acidity didn't linger on the palate at all. Prices were good too!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in the city.  A 4 shot latte is almost a dollar under what Starbucks charges, and it doesn't taste like starbucks crapola!  Great vibe, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I love the aesthetics of Constellation - minimalist. And their coffee is great too! I usually order the iced vanilla latte. The baristas are quite hipster and friendly to all their customers. They keep the shop really clean every time I come. One thing that hesitates me from coming here often is the seating. It's a hit or miss. They have two large long tables and a couple other small tables. Also, not many outlets for those who want to work with laptops or tablets. There's free wifi!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop in Lawerenceville. Met a friend on a Saturday morning (around 10AM). I arrived early thinking parking and seating would be tough, but there was plenty on both. The interior is simple and minimal like their menu. The staff was friendly and attentive. This is a great place to have a quiet conversation, bring a laptop, or read. Would love to try their vegan treats next. My friend said she enjoyed her iced chai latte and I had a great iced coffee."}
{"text":"Wow, it was very refreshing to walk into this coffee shop this morning. It was a beautiful morning, and I decided to simply walk around the neighborhood and stop in to a new place for a good cup of coffee. This place is unlike any other shop in the city: it's in such a cool unique space right on Penn, and I ironically enjoyed the whiteness and pure minimalistic design of the place. Simply furnished with a few simple tables and a bar in an older store-front (probably an older house), this place is all about the coffee. And it's great. I lived in Central America for almost two years and didn't have coffee this good. The young woman who owns the place - I think her name is Amy - was wonderful and incredibly educated about her coffee. We stood and talked for a few before things started to pick up. And I loved the other patrons that come in here. This is by far the hippest shop in Pittsburgh- frequented by the alternative and very Lawrenceville-y crowd. It was so hip that I felt like I didn't belong; but dammit, I'm coming in again as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Had a great pour over and cold brew here today.  Quiet, minimalist (but not obnoxiously so) environment, pleasantly warmed by natural light. Very relaxed vibe with a separate back room that seems more suited for conversation/meetings. Seems like a great shop for reading or studying as well.   Overall a great spot with top notch coffee. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place in a quieter part of town. Very simple and modern. The ice coffee was superb, it was nice to get it in an actual glass rather than a disposable cup. Kind of on the smaller side but a nice ambience. Although I do have to say the menu made me think I was in a pizza shop... Not the normal chalkboard menu you might see in many coffee shops."}
{"text":"Came in here a couple of days ago hoping for some great coffee and to get some work done, and I am happy to report that I got both! I had walked up Main from Butler so was kind of a sweaty wreck after what felt like 10000000% humidity  but didn't get any judgemental looks which was much appreciated. I got the cold brew which seemed extra delicious, but they did give me a plastic cup, and when I looked around everyone else had glass. A subtle hint to leave? Or maybe I just wasn't a regular. It was great coffee, a nice place to do some academic reading, and right on the bus line so I am sure I will be back! Hopefully they will get to know me and I will merit reusable mugs :D"}
{"text":"Love this place. No fuss, no frills, and very convenient for work meetings, coffee dates with friends, and solo studying/working. I usually stick with their cold brew in the warmer months, but this time of year, I treat myself to a lovely cappuccino. The large front window allows for some sunshine (and people watching if you're like me and distract easily) if you're lucky enough to snag one of the front tables."}
{"text":"Great espresso and terrific milk drinks.  Staff is super friendly and laid back.   Wish it was closer to home."}
{"text":"We have been exploring different hipster coffee shops and constellation is one of the few that does a pourover (Chemex). The pourover was excellent with the Guatemalan roast and the barista was so kind as to bring us a sample mini cup of a different coffee. The scone was delicious and my chai was delicious. The space was sparse clean with not too much foot traffic. Enjoyed and will come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee spots in Pittsburgh. Cliff and Amy (the baristas) are super friendly and knowledgable, and they're always happy to talk about coffee or just about anything else. Also they've got great taste in music, which makes hanging out even more fun. Speaking of which, the atmosphere is great for meeting up with friends or getting work done. Even better, they've got Ceremony coffee, which is great for people who are looking for beans to take home. They've also got a great tea selection for people who aren't into coffee. Overall, a great place that I'd recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the hipster pretension of this place. Reviews that say the same seem to be buried--wish I'd seen them. Twice, I have been helped by a young woman covered in tattoos with a mouth piercing, who told me I couldn't get a mocha with coffee because \"the textures don't work well together\"...second experience was no better. Won't be returning. Get over yourselves."}
{"text":"I caught up with a friend and had coffee here last weekend after wanting to try it for some time. I was very impressed with the pretty atmosphere and wonderful service overall. I would come back here in a heartbeat for quality coffee and a nice spot to spend time in, although the lack of vegan food options would sadly prevent me from staying for a full afternoon.  We had their pour over coffee on this visit, and I really enjoyed it. The aroma was mildly fruity and the aftertaste of the coffee itself was far from bitter. It was Peruvian coffee if I remember correctly. The barista warmed our mugs using hot water before pouring it out and adding the fresh coffee, which I thought was a nice touch! He also only charged us for one cup of coffee each rather than the price for a full pour over, since he just made us one double pour over to share. That alone is worth coming back to me. Thanks for treating us right on a very snowy Sunday morning, Constellation!"}
{"text":"Very cute and quaint coffee shop off of Penn Avenue. It's a medium sized, artsy space adorned with 4 or 5 two seater tables and 1 4 seater table in front of the counter and a meeting room for 6-8 people in the back do have quieter, private conversation.  The backroom is adorned in art which is lovely, ask the barista who the artist is.  The the regular house coffee, good quality and natural sweeteners. Prices are equivalent to similar sized coffee houses. Wi-fi available with password from Barista. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've returned many times since my first review. This is my favorite spot in the city to study or work remotely, the staff is always very nice, and their mocha lattes are delicious (my drink of choice in the winter). If you arrive early enough, you will be able to find a table in the back (they have about 4). There are also tables in the front of the shop as well. It's very minimalistic decor in here, which I find to be calming and less distracting, which helps in getting work done. Their coffee is delicious, and they offer some sweet treats as well, such as granola and pastries. Besides the adorable work space in the back of the shop, my favorite aspect of this coffee shop is their \"Pay it forward\" system, where you can purchase drinks for folks and leave a post-it note with a note (who should take the free drink and what you purchased for them). Most of these notes are for parents of children who are in Children's Hospital (right up the street), but many of them are reserved for folks having a bad day in general, stressed out college students, etc. I love reading the notes and seeing the pure good in people come out in this simple gesture."}
{"text":"Chemex for pour-over! Lots of bean selections! (Not a roaster, tho.) Cliff is awesome, really knows his coffee. Nice place, two large rooms, combination of long tables and small tables. Might need to ask for a stronger brew on the pour over (less water), depending on your taste. Big front windows. Traffic on Penn precludes calm seating outside."}
{"text":"Constellation is simplicity and quality at its best! The quality of the product and the environment is what I take away as being the point of focus here.  It's a really comfortable spot to sit and have a coffee in or to get work done and not be distracted by other things going on. It's also great for a quick cup on a busy morning for under $2."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and spacious. Definitely needed as there are few coffee shops on Penn. The coffee was good - got a cold brew and a regular iced and we appreciated the simple menu. The pastries looked good, will have to try them next time!"}
{"text":"It definitely is as quiet as people say, but there were enough people coming in and out that my group was able to have a conversation without seeming to interrupt the people who were there working. I had a chai latte made with almond milk, and it was so so so good I almost went and got another after I finished the first one. Another nice thing is the big windows at the front of the store, letting a lot of natural light in. They also have vegan cookies from Eden, always a plus."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great coffee, awesome people, independently strong. I had a great conversation with the owner of the café. The location is really awesome and close (walking distance) to other independent shops. The lighting is really great in the café and plenty of seating. The coffee was fresh and juicy. We were greeted by many smiling faces and friendly hellos. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee and get some work done. They have plenty of room inside. I tried their chai tea latte and loved that it was not sweet at all ( some chai concentrates are the way too sweet). Parking is street parking but you can usually find a spot!"}
{"text":"I don't visit Constellation as often as I'd like because it's at least 3 coffee shops away from me [ the travesty of living on Penn Ave dead center between Voluto, Artisan, 4121, and here ].   That being said, I always enjoy my trips, love the manual brews and espresso equally, and find the atmosphere to be appealing for all manner of visits [social, work, just stopping in].   They source an interesting array of Ceremony Coffees and are, as far as I know, the only Pittsburgh source for said roaster."}
{"text":"Super chill atmosphere with great employees, but the tea is ridiculously expensive for what you get. I got a pretty average oolong tea here yesterday and it was $5 for a 12 oz cup, but then it was only like 3/4 full. Everything else on the menu seems more reasonably priced, and I'm sure it's all very good. Unfortunately a disappointing first experience, although the fact that there was a very sleepy bull dog just chilling not far from where we sat slightly made up for it."}
{"text":"Love the vibe in here! Super quite and the decor is very minimalist. The coffee was good. The thing I liked most was that everyone was focused on their work and there wasn't too much chatting. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My favorite local coffee shop! They have stellar coffee and tea! It's a great spot to study or catch up with a friend. I also love that after you order, you can have a seat and they bring your drink to you - rather than standing around at the end of the coffee bar waiting for my order to be called out. Classy."}
{"text":"Even the drip stays on your palate like a pourover. If you care about good quality coffee and you arent a simpleton who puts cream and 10 grams of sugar in your coffee, you need to come here.  Amy is the most polite and wonderful barista that has ever lived, I am convinced and no matter how many days in a row or hours she works, her attitude is always kind and helpful.   If you leave a bad review, it's safe to say that you have no idea how to taste coffee and you should just stick with Starbucks."}
{"text":"Quaint, clean, modern, friendly staff, great coffee and not overly crowded (looking at you, coffee shops with 5,000 tables crammed in)!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Constellation Coffee shines brightly among the growing number of places where one can get a stellar soy cappuccino. Nice light space populated with sizable tables; great for spreading out your sky map, or collaborating on the launch of your next big enterprise. The only thing I found to be lacking was variety of pastries or snacks (only one was available). I believe it is written in the stars that I shall return to Constellation again (and that I will continue to make hackneyed jokes for the rest of my uncelestial existence)."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee. Bare-bones treats/snacks, but man! I'm glad I grabbed that glazed donut. Dense with a sourdough tang. Eager to go back next time I'm in town and have time to sit and sip"}
{"text":"Underrated. I had a cortado and it was excellent. The minimalist vibe and surrounding art is quite inspiring as well . Definitely recommend a cup of coffee here."}
{"text":"Hipster central, but what coffee shop isn't these days? Coffee is good, much better than what you'll get across the street. The main gripe is that they don't really wash any of the mugs. Everything gets dunked in a mystery liquid. As a result, the coffee takes on a really weird chemical taste. When it comes to the espresso, however, these guys know what they're doing...probably because it was originally done at some point in the early 70s."}
{"text":"Great coffee-good atmosphere if you're looking for a quiet place to get some work done"}
{"text":"Over priced for Pittsburgh but good coffee. I am a coffee snob and willing to pay for good coffee and nice environment but this is a bit overpriced. It is more expensive than Boston where I am from. People working there are very nice, score for personnel should be 5/5."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! My fiance and I came by on a weekday to get some work done while we were visiting Pittsburgh for a day. He got a latte and I got a dirty chai and we both split a banana nut muffin and cherry chocolate chip scone. The drinks were made perfectly and the pastries were delicious. They also have an awesome back area with tables, which made working super easy and convenient. Service was super as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite coffeehouses in Pittsburgh. I love going here early Saturday mornings with some work or a book and just relaxing with a cup of good coffee or chai masala.   I love the open air, simple décor and the real flowers at every table. There is also local art on display. There are some tables in the front of the establishment and a separate room in the back.  I wish they had longer hours or that they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Really good pour over. Ham & cheese pastry was decent. Sitting area is minimalistic, lacking a ton of decoration but clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and offered any coffee knowledge help we needed."}
{"text":"Love the bright environment here! When I have to focus on work, I go to the back room & most everyone there is studying or doing work--and is considerate and quiet. The staff are always very nice & kindly bring you your drink when it is done being made!"}
{"text":"Another great start-up coffee shop! Not that they make coffee like they're beginners- the coffee is perfect and the barista performed nicely. The interior borders on a bit boring, but maybe its just because its so clean and original. So, friendly barista and great coffee, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"First time here. Good vibes. Excellent espresso (Ceremony beans are among my favorite up and coming roasters). I haven't finished my espresso yet and am already looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"great coffee. great people. clean uncluttered space which is unusual in pgh coffee shops"}
{"text":"Constellation was great! Coffee is my thing. Coffee shops are my thing. If both are good, I'm quite happy. Constellation is good. Real good. I like the vibe inside! The baristas were very nice and chipper. With the cloud coverage we get in Pittsburgh 10 months out of the year - we need genuine chipperentalities in our baristas.   Seating is sometimes hard to come by at this shop, but there are quite a few of them! I got a regular cup of coffee. I have to say, it wasn't pour-over (I just ordered a reg coffee for kicks and giggles), but their coffee is great! It really is. I'll update when I try a mocha.   Wifi works well.  A major con for me is the hours of operation. 7am-6pm Monday-Friday and 7am-5pm on Saturday-Sunday. I get the area. I get people want to drink at night. But as a coffee shop lover...a shop closing before 9pm (at earliest) is just terrible to me. Espresso a mano sees the demand up through the evening hours, working with a similar demographic. I wish Constellation followed the example!   The shop is clean! Location is great! Music choice was good. I'll be back and probably with friends."}
{"text":"I love Constellation Coffee for the following reasons:  1. Atmosphere is delightful. Its a really bright & sunny room with hardwood floors. Very minimal & clean. There is also a bar where you can sit & have coffee. There are about 6 tables, and a back room for more quieter meetings or discussions. Also the music Amy choses to play is great! I almost never put headphones in which is nice. A lot of oldies, hip-hop, and other upbeat tunes.   2. Menu - great selection of coffee & tea very reasonable priced! She often has treats from Pittsburgh Pie guys in shop. Coffee beans are from a place in Maryland called Ceremony. Good stuff!  3. The owner Amy is very pleasant. She is super friendly. It's also inspiring to see someone so young run a wonderful little shop."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but what sets this place apart from others is the owner is super nice and the place is bright and airy. I came in to get my coffee to go, but I could totally see myself coming back here to work. There are about 6 tables and it's reasonably quiet. There's even an extra room in the back with a few more tables where you could have small group discussions without bothering the rest of the shop. Didn't have a chance to test out the Wi-Fi, but it is available. Hope to stop in again soon!"}
{"text":"I was making my way cross-country and this was my first stop. I was recommeneded by a friend who lived in the area for a few months. What a sweet spot. Really simple and beautiful space with plenty of room to work or catch up with a friend. The coffee! I love any place that offers chemex or any other unique brew process."}
{"text":"First off it has amazing coffee. They use Ceremony beans which are in my opinion the best in the city right now. The owner is extremely knowledgeable about coffee and can definitely point you in the right direction.  The space is clean an elegant with a conference room in the back which is a well needed addition for that area!   Definitely stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Had a nice maple latte last weekend. Cute spot, with nice natural light and quality espresso options. Plus, they support Planned Parenthood! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops to go to. It's a really lovely space (minimalist, open, warm), the baristas are super nice, and perhaps most of all, you get a really spectacular cup of coffee. The pastries are also delicious. Good for catching up with a friend or for doing work! I only wish it was easier to find a seat on Saturday afternoons!"}
{"text":"Constellation is my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. A fine combination of quality, ambiance, and unpretentiousness. The last feature is truly rare in a good coffee shop, and I appreciate that. I found this place oddly difficult to find (it's near the closed Grateful Deli) but I'm glad I persisted. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am notoriously known among my friends as a coffee addict. In my spare time, I like exploring new coffee places in Pittsburgh and I found another place I love. I happen upon this place on my way to work. The coffee shop is very open with wide glass windows and very clean. They offer free Wi-Fi and have several tables for their patrons. I have no complains about their coffee and always feel bad when they spend time on the latte art for my to-go cup since I was going to destroy in seconds after. Constellation Coffee will continue to be one of my go-to places for coffee before work."}
{"text":"Constellation Coffee is a beautiful coffee shop. It's clean, modern and comfortable. You know what you are getting when you order your beverage, and there's no complicated menus to deal with. Each drink is made with expert care and knowledge about coffee and steaming milk.   The more often I go to local cafes in Pittsburgh, the more I find that Starbucks is horrible by comparison. I am so spoiled by places like Constellation!   Aside from the wonderful minimalist drinks and environment, it IS a great place to hang out with friends, read, study, or do light work. It's also easily accessible. My only complaint is that they aren't open late enough, but it's a local coffee shop, so I don't necessarily *expect* that. It would just be awesome.   I will forever be a fan, and if you are too, you can pick up branded items here to represent your love of Pittsburgh cafes."}
{"text":"Clean, minimal, and sophisticated. This place is the kind of coffee shop that you see on Instagram, and the coffee is ridiculously awesome to boot. Great place to get a lot of work done, not such a great place to hang out with friends (people might shoot you death glares). I definitely plan on coming back - also, the Lawrenceville location is absolutely great for wandering around afterwards and exploring. I had trouble getting onto the Wi-Fi, which was pretty annoying and I ended up paying for xfinity."}
{"text":"The coffee is terrible, I was really hoping this place would be a little gem. Not the case. I love supporting local coffee shops, but my latte was poorly made and tasted like warm milk more than espresso. My girlfriend ordered a cold brew coffee, her experience was the same."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here on a snowy day. My cortado was excellent and the barista was very friendly. My friend's chai latte was really good too. The shop itself is spacious and airy. If I lived in PGH, I'd make this my go-to weekend reading/coffee drinking spot."}
{"text":"After a very filling breakfast I decided to \"work it off\" by hiking up here for some coffee and treats. Their pastries comes from 350 bakery in the Southside. I learned that 350 bakery is a catering establishment. Others come from one of my favorites Mediterra bakery.  I got to sample the coffee of the day which had a bit of a fruity taste so I went with it and ordered a cranberry orange scone from 350 bakery. Both were very good. I already know the quality of Mediterra and believe me they also make great pastries and breads you can find most anywhere or in their home base in Robinson Twp. The salesman told me he could make a pour over if I didn't like it or settle for a regular blend. I thought that was very thoughtful of him and was glad with the my guatemala coffee with the fruity notes. They too sell it but at a hefty pricetag. Yes, there is a gender neutral restroom here.  This place offers free WiFi since many students come here with their laptops. This is another very good coffeeshop I want to revisit on my future trips to this area. I am anxious to try out some of the other baked goods from 350 bakery since they are a catering establishment."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of all the reasons I hate Portland, OR.  Mega rude, definitely way too cool for me, and a really uncomfortable arrogant vibe that makes you feel like you're inconveniencing them by being a customer.   Setup.  I really wanted some relish doughnuts because I had just had my second biopsy in a month. I happened to be by constellation and HUZZAH it was relish's delivery day.  I stop in.  One barista sort of smiles at me and then does a pretty sweet movement of pretending to be busy but is really just shifting stuff around.  Second barista stares at me.  I'm assuming she had no muscles in her face because that broad doesn't have the ability to smile.    I ask if there were any relish doughnuts left and second barista points at a stand.  Oh ok great.  I ask if those were the flavors they have left.  She again points at the stand, rolls her eyes so intensely I'm surprised she didn't fall over, and tells me the flavors they have...in a tone so damn annoyed you would have thought I asked her to read the phone book.    This lovely interaction follows up with, \"so which one do you want..\" and then, \"is that it?  No coffee?\"  Feeling bullied into a god damned coffee, I ordered a cold brew.  Oh cool...burnt dirt water that tastes like it's roughly six months old.  Badass.   I tipped way more than I should, threw away the coffee, and inhaled the doughnuts in my car.  This coffee shop is garbage and I will never understand why some service industry people choose to be jerks to customers that haven't given them a reason yet."}
{"text":"Constellation Coffee is a pleasant little spot right on Penn. The design of the shop is very simple, with tons of light pouring in through the front windows. It has a very relaxed atmosphere; a great place to relax and read a book without a ton of bustle and distraction.   The menu is pretty simple; you'll find all of the classics. I have had both hot and iced lattes from here, and the drinks have been consistently good. The baristas definitely know what they are doing and have always been really friendly.  They have some food items for sale (though I have not yet tried any) as well as some shirts and other apparel with their branding. Definitely a good spot to check out for a caffeine boost!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that overall, the latte with maple syrup that I had was divine.  However, upon entering, my boyfriend and I were met with the cold judging stares of a full room of overly hipster-esque diners who we'd interrupted from their technological hypnosis. Throughout our visit, the air was awkwardly stiff and so silent you could hear a crumb drop. The menu, while exotic and very well brewed, lacked any real choice apart from your brew blend. There was no sweetener I could see or find. Also, when we requested simple natural flavors, like vanilla, we were informed the only such ingredient they had was maple syrup.  We ended up paying nearly $9 for a latte, a shot of espresso and a glass bottled coke."}
{"text":"Great, clean, quiet little coffee shop near UPMC's Children hospital. Parking isn't bad either. Both their coffee and lattes were perfect. They're made fresh and so it has a great flavor and a silky smooth texture. Staff is friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Constellation is a cool spot and located in a great part of town. The latte I had was quite good and I could tell it was made with love :). Two pretty huge drawbacks here for me are the chairs and the temperature...it is freezing in the back room and I had to wear my coat while I worked from my laptop. Call the waaambulance, right? But really though...y'all need to think about a space heater and some comfy chairs! Multiple people were here working and I know I would stay longer if these things changed. A friend who came here a couple weeks ago actually warned me about how cold the back room was. Maybe in the spring/summer it will be better."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. The drawback is it close pretty early while I just start my work around 2 or 3, that's why I choose to go to its nearby competitor sometimes. Its pour over has always been a top notch."}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say that I was a little nervous coming here after all the comments on the atmosphere being very rigid in quiet. I must say, this is accurate but not in a unfriendly-inhabitable way. The store is very aesthetically pleasing, largely minimal and bright. The menu also reflects this minimalistic vibe. I order the chai latte. The flavor and foam were excellent, but I found that it was cold. The barista didn't talk much, but she was friendly. I had trouble with the wifi. It was not working for me. All in all, it was good, not great. I'll probably find myself back here at some point."}
{"text":"Constellation Coffee is a modern and minimalistic little coffee shop, and it works really well for them. I've been wanting to come here for quite some time and I'm glad I finally got around to it!  The atmosphere is more clean and simplistic than it is warm. That being said, it still has a really nice aesthetic and I think I would enjoy hanging out here for awhile. There are a few tables near the front of the store by the large windows, a few tables near the bar area, and then some larger tables and bench areas in a back room. I wish we had been able to get one of the tables at the front of the shop, but it seems like these are the ones that probably go the quickest since there's so much nice natural light there. There are not many paintings on the walls, and everything feels really clean cut and contemporary. I absolutely love their branding - the font they use for their logo is beautiful, and I like the way they put stars on the hand stamped cups.  I had a hot chocolate here this time - I don't really know why, I was just in the mood. The cocoa itself was not really anything special if I'm being honest; it didn't seem chocolatey or flavorful enough for me, which was kind of a letdown. However, the presentation was beautiful and it put a huge smile on my face when I saw the colorful marshmallows on top of the drink. They reminded me of my childhood and I thought it was a cute touch.  I definitely need to come back again to try more of the drinks. While the hot chocolate wasn't my favorite, I did really enjoy the atmosphere and the clean vibes. Hopefully I'll be back soon!"}

{"text":"Very nice coffeeshop, though at least on my visit, it wasn't as quiet as others had indicated. Perhaps it was a peculiar day, but it was fairly loud when I was there (being that I came to work, I wouldn't have minded some quiet). The conventional wisdom on this place otherwise holds: the service was friendly and professional, the quality of the products was good, and it was a good place to study despite being louder than expected.   One sidepoint: it's easy to miss this place on your first visit; I walked right past it the first time I went there."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop. I like the aesthetic because it's very clean and modern looking. Not cluttered at all. The menu is very simple, with classics including coffee, of course, but also latte's, cappuccino's and chai's. They also have pour over coffee for you artisan coffee lovers. I'm a chai gal myself, and was glad to hear they had a good brand of chai (Rishi I believe) and also offer almond milk.  There aren't too many tables, but they do have a fair amount of two seaters, a longer table with benches and a meeting room in the back. LOVE the funky art on the wall. Not sure if you can buy it, but I'll look next time to see!  My only small complaint was that the tables near the front window were in direct sunlight, so if you sat there you'd bake on a hot day. There's air conditioning, but you're sitting right in the sun. Might be okay for the winter, but definitely not the summer. I'd suggest some blinds to pull down, or sit there if you're always cold and it will warm you right up!"}
{"text":"Eek.  The downside of loving a place, and then posting about Said Love on the internet, is that you risk contributing to changing what you value about it.  But it can't be helped-- Constellation is freakin' wonderful. It has a light, minimal, and restful atmosphere.  It is never so crowded that I feel hostile towards humanity. Espresso a Mano may serve the best espresso in town, but Constellation has the best drip coffee.  Seriously.  Try it."}
{"text":"Top notch coffee. We decided to try this place out and so glad we did. It's minimalistic so there's not much decor or fancy chalk boards which means all the work and detail goes into the coffee. It's a little hole in the wall of a place on a main Street. If you want fancy sugary drinks, you won't find them here however if you want great espresso or lattes, this is it. The latte was awesome and I loved that it was a 12oz rather than a teeny tiny $4 cup I got at the commonplace last time we went for coffee. My husband had the chai and it was delicious and spicy! We will def be back."}
{"text":"Such a perfect ambiance. The minimalistic design  helps me leave the week behind and embrace the weekend ahead. A quick thank you to the owners, I appreciate the environment you have so thoughtfully created. Upon entering your establishment my creativity flows with boundless energy. It's so hard to find a coffee shop with heart, organization, and local art. My only hang up is that you close at 5 which limits my ability to become a regular."}
{"text":"I was here on separate occasion. Things have changed.  I love small local business. I love supporting them. For Constellation, I will give them 4 for customer service, 4 for the wonderful muffin (oatmeal raisin) I had. But definitely a 1 for coffee, in this case I had a latte. First time I've had a muffin with out the paper wrapper. It was rather tasty and not too sweet. I think this place lacks a selection of sweets. Coffee selection is also skimpy. The flavor of the latte was very watery, tasted like milk boiled, a dab of coffee. I can get better taste with instant Folgers. Paid $4. for this cup and was really disappointing. It's spacious and clean. But has a funny smell when entering the door, almost like, old men. I didn't want to give them a 2, however,  for a large sign that says coffee on the window and the price of $4.00 , you would think the coffee would be memorable."}
{"text":"Had to have my morning coffee fix. So I ended up here. The barista poured me s beauty and I sat at the community table and struck up some casual convo with the locals."}
