{"text":"I mean great wings, dry rub and original are the best. Dive bar with clean tables. Buuuut I've been here twice, with a party of five, and both times itself taken us 3.5hrs to order, get our food. And that's because the 2nd time we came back, we ordered as soon as we got in and it still took us that long. Pretty frustrating when you see a table of four, order the exact same amount of plates (6 plates with 2 appetizer plates) and they came in 30 minutes after us. Another table came in and ordered right before us, noticed that both of our tables were before and said something to the waiter, he brought their food out and we stillll waited another 40 minutes. 

The wings are great but not worth the wait. 

Management: if your gonna promote your amazing wings, you should be prepared to hire more staff on the weekends."}
{"text":"These folks almost trip over themselves to provide great service.  

Ordered the dry rub and the original wings, with sides and drinks. Very reasonably priced. The wings were a little too good and ended up eating over a dozen.  I'll be back!

A gem."}
{"text":"Go for the sign - a chicken drinking a martini.  The wings (which at $9 were the most expensive thing on the menu)  were quite good but I agree with the previous review that the beer tasted a little off."}
{"text":"Yes ! I clicked my heels after having my first order of Original.  Totally off the beaten path.  I live within a mile of Lips and I seriously thought, \" oh no, not another tabasco joint.\" But I am thanking my lucky stars that Chicken Lips is not the place of crappy wings but a place of Family recipes and secret spices.  Don't get me  wrong. Lips is totally casual,
But the wings are Top Shelf. Blue cheese!! I could almost drink it its so good.  After all that folks, I want to say that a particular chef made me a blue burger that was the best meat sandwich I've had in a year.  
   Your awesome.     Jeremiah.    Of course I'm going back and I would put Chicken Lips  fresh wings and dummies  to the test folks.  Plus you get to meet the colorful and completely harmless owner..  Big Screen TV's and a back room for parties. Five stars."}
{"text":"If you are looking for The Best wings & drummies around, this is the place. Flavor for days. Blue cheese that is out of this world. Fun dive bar feel or great for take out! Can't go wrong, unless you drive by without stopping!!"}
{"text":"Way better than bww, wings and ring, and any other wing place around the  seasoning before the wing sauce is awesome  probably the moistest chicken wings I have ever eaten"}
{"text":"A friend organized an outing to Chicken Lips...he'd heard they had good chicken wings and atmosphere.  CL is definitely a slice of Wisconsin...and the owner, Steve, epitomizes all that's right with our state.  He's friendly, gregarious...and he happens to make fantastic chicken wings!  He also makes his own blue cheese dip...which, as a blue cheese lover, I loved...big chunks of cheese in a tasty sauce!

Only knock on the place:  they can get a little overwhelmed with orders...and it doesn't take too many to overwhelm them.  But, on the plus side, they have Guinness on tap...so at least one can nurse one's beer whilst one waits.  They also have Hopalicious and Spotted Cow...so you can do a bunch of tasty nursing!

I had only the original recipe...which is really not spicy, in fact it's more like fried chicken with a bit of spice than a traditional  Buffalo Wings...where your lips should be appropriately burning after consumption.  A friend had the dry rub version and thought it quite tasty.

So, if you find yourself in the (relative) wilds of Sun Prairie...stop at Chicken Lips,"}
{"text":"This is definitely our new go-to place for wings!! Killer wings, awesome jukebox tunes, friendly staff... We'll be back... Often:))"}
{"text":"Great wings! The dry rub is worth the trip. Their blue cheese that comes with the wings is also fantastic.  I will be making another trip in soon."}
{"text":"I live in Denver, but may have to take a trip here just for the wings! They are legit!"}
{"text":"Chicken lickin' good!  More than $10.00 because you'll want a drink  to make the chicken and dive place  fun!"}
{"text":"If I could marry Chicken Lips, I might. I'd for sure elope with their incredible homemade blue cheese dressing. And get that dressing to go too -- in pints (serious protip on that one). We LOVE their wings and deem them the best of Madison (or Sun Prairie if you're getting picky and technical). The place itself isn't a looker. But my husband tells me that they have good graffiti in the bathroom (ex: on the condom dispenser this note, \"this gum tastes like sh*t\")"}
{"text":"A 3.5 review but Yelp doesn't do half stars.

It's always hard to find a good wing place outside of Buffalo (grew up there). This looked like it was a highly reviewed place so decided to give it a try.

It is your classic dive bar that serves food. I got the medium wings. They were very good but small! Did not come in sauce like I expected. (I think I should have ordered the original). I definitely left hungry but the wings had a great flavor to them. The blue cheese was also excellent. If they were bigger, this would be an easy 4 star place. 

Also, this is a \"go to the bartender and tell them what you want\" sort of place. Better to sit at the bar because you can get refills easier. Bartender was friendly.

I'll probably give this place another chance when I am really craving wings (anything beats BWW or Quaker Steak). I'll update my review on my next visit. Hopefully will get bigger wings next time."}
{"text":"This place is a complete run down pile with awesome wings. I read all the reviews and was aware it was in the middle of nowhere and was a dive but pulling up I did a double take lol. All of that does not matter though!

The bartender instructed me to get the original wings for my first tour. They are a combination of an awesome dry rub followed by a delicious buffalo sauce bath. You get about 12-14 crispy juicy carmelized deliciousness along with a huge thing of what seems to be homemade blue cheese and two celery sticks.

If anyone who has been to points east pub in Milwaukee for wings, this place is comparable. Spicy mouth watering wings with depth of flavor. I would say the most solid non-chain wing joint in the Madison area. I will definitely be back and I hope my food is just as delicious next trip."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout. My man and I order from Chicken Lips once a month. I would say they are the best I have had in the Madison area. They don't have five million flavors that you can mix but that's ok sometimes. I prefer the dry rub wings with blue cheese dressing. The original wings are actually pretty spicy. One order is definitely filling, especially if I'm drinking beer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for hot wings, they are not hot.  Small wings, they give you a decent amount but for a price.  The bar is not a bar; its in the bottom of someone's house.
Cash only.
Dive bar of dive bars. 
Not worth the drive"}
{"text":"If you're on a mission to hit hole in the wall chicken, burrito, and burger joints then you better add Chicken Lips to your short list.  And besides that, how can you not smile when you hear a restaurant with the name Chicken Lips?

This is a non-descript house located a few miles from Madison, WI.  It's very casual inside -- maybe a dozen tables and a good old fashioned formica bar.  From the juke box in the corner to the rusted out condom dispenser in the men's room (I didn't check out the women's room ...) this place smacks of character and fodder for your next conversation with your buddies.

The chicken wings?  Very good.  I would not call them the best that I've had (Crosstown Pub in Naperville, IL still rules) but they're very good.  The homemade blue cheese is not to be missed.  My wings were with the house dry rub and were quite tasty.

Two in our group of four had burgers.  The burger was quality meat and received that nod of enjoyment with the expected accompanying dribble of burger juice down the chin.  The only gripe, and I agree with this, is that the burger is served just by itself on the plate.  No tomato.  No lettuce.  Really?  C'mon Chicken Lips.  If you can serve celery with chicken wings you can serve lettuce and tomato with a burger."}
{"text":"Yum! Great wings. Townie bar with jukebox and pool. Nothing fancy. The 3 times I've been there I've always stayed longer than expected chatting up with the friendly bar staff. A place to go for a group of people who just want a place to enjoy one another's company. Could use a few updates but who am I to complain when the prices are reasonable and the name is just funny!"}
{"text":"Um... wow. For $9.50 you get 1 - 1 1/2 lbs of crispy, golden fried wings and a couple of celery sticks. 

At first, you may think that they look small in comparison to other places but don't let their size fool you. You can eat all the way down to the bone, no meat is wasted and they boast a punch of flavors. I can't put my hands on the seasonings, I see red pepper flakes, but is that also a hint of curry powder?? Long hair don't care, this is as good as it gets!

I will echo others, get it naked with sauce on the side. Their own spin on the classic buffalo sauce.

Didn't stay to get a drink at the bar, but from just eyeballing there was one single shelf above a handful of table beer taps.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Great food. Don't come dressed up. Get anything with their dry rub, it'll be great. It'll have a long wait on busy days so make sure you come on time. Also, not a lot of seating available but the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Always great food from this place in the middle of nowhere.  If you want the best wings in the Madison area, ignore the chains and make the trip out here.  Down to earth folks, great wings and sides.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"I don't get it...the wings weren't all I've been told. Super rude bartender that would not admit to messing up our order. Only served half the table. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My boyfriend and I have heard great things about their wings so we decided to try them out. We went in and sat at the bar to order food to go. We put in our order and my boyfriend got a beer while we waited. After his first glass he asked for a taste sample of another beer. He didn't like it so he got another glass of his usual beer. We saw the kitchen place to go food by the register. The bartender continued to serve other guests. She closed out checks and even went to the dinging room and cleared dirty dishes. The whole time we were hoping that wasn't our food sitting there. She had walked by it and saw it there for 15 min! Finally she brought it to us and gave us the bill. She charged us for the sample my boyfriend asked for! I couldn't believe it! She let our food sit there and then charged us for a sample?! Horrible horrible service. Needless to say we will never be back"}
{"text":"Ok, I am 100% rating this on what it is...which is a dive bar with AMAZING chicken wings! Probably the best chicken wings I have ever had. My husband and I tried both the buffalo and the dry rub. Both great but the buffalo sauce won for me. It was absolutely delectable! Do yourself a favor and get the waffle fries with the dry rub on them! They were also insanely tasty.
The blue cheese dressing is also tops if you are a blue cheese fan. Super big pieces of blue cheese. So delicious.
If you love chicken wings and don't mind a bit of a divey atmosphere, get here ASAP!"}
{"text":"Hot diggity dawg. Chicken lips does NOT disappoint. It's located in what looks like an old house/bar between Sun Prairie and Cottage Grove. Super random, but thats part of the charm.

Upon walking into to this divey wonder, you'd expect a simple towny bar with the same rotation of regulars sitting at its barstools. This may be true but don't let that scare you away! Chicken Lips has a pretty simple menu posted on an old letter board probably dating me in age. Showcasing essential fried bar food and most importantly four options of wings. Don't expect to see any exotic options like boneless, asian zing or parmesan garlic. This aint no Bdubs! Your selections are original, buffalo, nude and dry rub. And let me tell you, they speak for themselves. The waffle fries with the dry rub are to die for and the blue cheese is out of this world. Even if you're not a fan of blue cheese I promise you, you'll enjoy their take on the creamy sauce. With no bells a whistles, I consider the wings at Chicken Lips the best in the Madison Area."}
{"text":"Chicken Lips looks live a dive bar when you walk in, but the staff is friendly and it's a cool place to eat.  These are some of the best chicken wings I think I've ever eaten.  I've tried both the original and the dry rub and they are second to none.  The homemade blue cheese is delicious!  I brought a friend here who does not like blue cheese and he was loving it.  I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Dive bar, in the middle of nowhere, with a great staff and awesome food. Was in Madison with some friends, stopped at Erin's Irish pub but they told us their kitchen was closing in 10 min so we scrambled to Yelp to find somewhere else near our hotel. Enter - Chicken Lips. 

You will think you're driving to the middle of nowhere - especially if you're going after dark. But trust your GPS and you'll get there. 

Original wings were pretty spicy and the Tator tots with dry rub hit the spot.  My friend got the cheese curds and those were tasty as well. The bartender Sarah (with an H) was super friendly and attentive, the locals made conversation at the bar. A diamond in the rough - check this place out."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate this isn't closer to Madison proper as I would quickly become a regular.

Wings are ordered by the dozen, and our standard order is one of the dry rub, one original, one extra sexy original, and an order of super sexy original.

The sexy designation is off menu, but results in spicier wings. I don't know if the extra spiciness comes from additional pepper flakes or the introduction of different types of pepper flakes but the super sexy will wake up your sinuses.

Reading previous reviews, I think I am one of the few that would prefer a more potent blue cheese dressing, as there homemade dressing is on the mild side and reminds me of cream cheese.

Waffle fries are good as well, but the wings are the main attraction.

You order at the bar, and they will offer to keep your tab open. However I have found during busy nights you can end up waiting 10-15 minutes to close your bill. I pay when I order now."}
{"text":"I like searching out country bars! They take you back in time.this place was once Doris's 2nd chance,come as you are,by car truck bike tractor or yes even by snowmobile. The wings are some of the best around. My first choice is dry rub with original a close 2nd. Friendly staff and customers. Bathrooms need a paint job."}
{"text":"Went here on a cold Thursday night with a couple of friends who were a little nervous to try this place. It's in a house-like building on the outskirts of town, with a chicken studying a martini on the sign, not to mention the weirdest name. 

Don't come here for the atmosphere, or the tap beer (my Guinness definitely tasted a little off), but do come here for the wings. We got the original style wings, made with a flavorful and slightly spicy dry rub and a tangy, vinagery buffalo sauce. Yum. Oh, and yes, the blue cheese dressing is all dat. 

If I lived in SP this would be my wings go-to spot hands down."}
{"text":"My family was in town & wanted wings -- I said \"I know where to go\" ----
The Dry Rub is amazing!  The \"sexy\" wings are just the right degree of hot!  And the blue cheese -- yummy!  Home made & it is obvious.  Our bartender Casey was attentive & fun -- we had a great night & left with a full belly!"}
{"text":"Wings were excellent!!! Highly recommend it! The order came out very quick. When driving there, slow down since the sign  is not the biggest one and is easy to miss."}
{"text":"Really sweet place outside of Madison. Solid Buffalo wings and the dry rub wings are pretty damn tasty. $10 for a good size basket of wings, tons of sauce and some of the best wings I have had in the state. I'm from Upstate NY, so I like to think I know a thing about wings. These are legit. It's worth the drive for good wings, cold beer, and good service."}
{"text":"I have lived within stumbling distance of Chicken Lips for roughly 15 years. It took me 13 of those years (and a change of ownership) to muster up the courage to step inside. Make no mistake: This place is not fancy. This place is pretty much a dive. But it is a remarkably popular dive. There's something bringing people here from miles around, and it's not just the chicken wings - although they are pretty good. This is the kind of place where you go to hide from something. Many Chicken Lips regulars appear to be hiding from either real life or their spouse. But where else in Dane County can three people belly up to the bar, order 3 beers, put a $10 on the bar, and get change back? For this reason alone, many are able to overlook the 1970's basement rec-room feel of the place, and the cringeworthy restrooms. Go to Chicken Lips with a healthy spirit of adventure. And if you take the kids, make sure they use the bathroom at home before you leave. PROTIP - Chicken Lips only accepts CASH. There is a privately-owned cash machine with a dial-up modem in the vestibule as you walk in the door, but be prepared for a hefty surcharge."}
{"text":"The BEST wings in the Madison area. (I know that is a bold statement, but I challenge anyone to prove otherwise!)  

They offer a couple different options for wings: original (which is dry rubbed and tossed in sauce), Dry (dry-rub only), or Naked (without dry-rub or sauce).  The original is my \"go-to\" but, to be honest, you really can't go wrong with any of them; ESPECIALLY once you dip them into their housemade Bleu Cheese (which is also available for sale by the pint, and tastes great on literally everything).
The portions are very generous, and you'll always leave satisfied. 

The bar is no-frills and divey; but the food is great, drinks are strong, the jukebox is on, the bartenders are friendly (Tell Casey I said HIIIII!), and the company is reminiscent of small-town Wisco; friendly, warm, and inviting. 

You've been dying to try this place. Do it, already."}
{"text":"It's been two days since our first visit to Chicken Lips and we are still talking about their amazing wings. To say these are the best chicken wings you ever had sounds like a flip and insincere form of hyperbole but it is the truth! We should have known we were in for something extraordinary when the parking lot was so full that cars were parked in the grass. This place has a great vibe, super casual atmosphere, friendly staff and literally the best wings anywhere. We live in the UP of Michigan but will always make a special trip to Chicken Lips anytime we are within 50 miles. We cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best wings in the Madison area hands down. Good portion sizes, cheap prices for food and drinks. Excellent service, and the best damn blue cheese dressing I've ever had. Venture out and check out this Madison gem you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Has been on our list to try for a long time .... did not disappoint.  My only complaint is the wings are pretty spicy..... and the bathroom is a lot dicey"}
{"text":"While visiting friends in Sun Prairie/Madison, I got dragged to Chicken Lips.  Not until I arrived did I realize that I surprisingly had the joint bookmarked---solely off of the stellar Yelp reviews causing it to pop up as one of Madison's best. *embarrassed*
Chicken Lips is literally just a minute or so drive outside of Sun Prairie's downtown on the side of a road among cornfields.  I don't know if I would consider it a restaurant.  It's more of a bar run out of a dude's (named Steve) first floor of his two-story house.  Think \"Man Cave\" or \"Bachelor Pad\" lacking any luxury, where \"boys can be boys.\"  There are TVs, a pool table, arcade games, a side door that opens up to a tent for smokers, some nasty piss-ridden bathrooms.  If only Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives actually visited true dives, this is what I'd picture, except they only specialize in chicken wings, not much else...  There's a bulletin menu at the bar, which is where you also order.  As someone who is not a fan of spice and on a non-fried food cleanse diet, I became 'that' guy that the neighboring table of 30-somethings picked on.  They kept reminding me while in their drunk stupor, \"You gotta get the wings.\"  I still ended up ordering a burger which was not very enjoyable and overcooked.  Nonetheless, the rest of my party ordered the infamous Wings.  You get your choice of Dry Rub (what it's all about: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chicken-lips-sun-prairie?select=xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ#NgrDOJ2ui4MlKh1-IVnOYg) or Original \"Buffalo\" wings.  Both come with a tasty side of homemade blue cheese dressing dip.  I could eat the entire cup of dip with just carrots and celery simple due to the fact that is has chunks of blue cheese hidden up in there!  Of course, I reminded myself, \"When in Sun Prairie, do as a Wisconsiner would\" and bit into each type of wing.  Without the dressing, the dry wings were admittedly the best wings I have ever had---freshly fried, full of meat, and extremely tasty.  Can't say I'd be back, if so it would definitely be take-out since I'm too prissy for a dive like this.  I will concur, the word on the street is right, they cook up some killer chicken wings!

Note: Before you leave, be sure to take a moment to absorb the glory of the bar and grill's name \"CHICKEN LIPS\" and the light-up sign picturing a rooster holding a martini: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chicken-lips-sun-prairie?select=xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ#xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ.  This is one place you would never find a martini glass, or even be seen with one in your hand..."}
{"text":"Yes it's a dive and yes it's totally worth it. Wings were so good! You should stop if you get the chance.  I stopped after picking up a pizza from nearby and glad I did"}
{"text":"Wow!  Simply the best crispy, juicy, seasoned wings we've had in Madison. Perfectly cooked and served. Get the dry rub wings. I loved them. They reminded me of the ones I've had in upstate NY. The original ones were outstanding too. They even have nude wings if you are that type of person. They make the blue cheese dip homemade too. Big creamy cheese goes excellent with the dry rubbed wings. Delish!! Great bartenders and people too!  This is a quintessential local WI bar in the middle of nowhere but close enough to enjoy if you're from Madison. 
Cash only. 

I've lived in Sun Prairie for 10years and was scared to go in as I thought it was only a bar for the snow mobilers. But after a friend's recommendation for the wings we went!  Now we're kicking ourselves for not going earlier. 

Go of you love wings!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings ever. I do not eat wing usually but this place is my favorite. The dry rub is amazing I wish they would sell it to the public. I highly recommend going there you won't be disappointed that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite to eat. This is the epitome of a dive bar. It's grungy and not the most attractive place, but the food and drinks are super affordable and delicious. The only light in the place is from the 2-19\" screen tvs, a neon signs, and a jukebox in the corner.

We stop in here every time we're in Sun Prairie. I prefer the wings tossed in their original sauce. They've got a house-made blue cheese dressing to die for. I don't even like bleu cheese, but you've got to try it!"}
{"text":"I will drive from the westside to here. I will spend my anniversary dinner here. I will cajole and drive my children to have their birthday dinner here. Wait..I did all that in the last month. 
Yes, the wings in any flavor are the bomb. Add the house bleu cheese dip and it's orgasmic.

Only issue I had was feeling uncomfortable both times coming for dinner. Service was decent, just not the most welcoming vibe. We came after a football game with our kids and there were ppl who clearly had too much to drink. Fortunately, there's a jukebox that can drown out the noise and there's seating that's away from the bar.

Food came out within 15-20 minutes of ordering. $9 per plate of wings, roughly 12 small-med sized pcs-preferred over jumbo wings."}
{"text":"I went to this place the other day based on the reviews and my general love of chicken wings. They certainly didn't disappoint. The interior is your standard dive bar fare. Nice bar a few tables and a small menu on the wall. The bartender, Sara, was very friendly and helpful (earned a 50% tip from me). I ordered the dry rub wings for $10 and a side order of mushrooms for $4. I was blown away by the amount of wings I got and then further blown away by how good they were! Their blue cheese is amazing and was perfect for the wings. I don't live on this side of town but i will frequently be making trips this way from now on."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law said this place was awesome, and frankly I was skeptical when the gang and I pulled up.  It's definitely in the country, but I love a good dive bar.  The wings. are. awesome.  We got platters of each type of rub/sauce they offer.  The dry rub was my favorite.  Also, their blue cheese dip is delish!  I'm not usually one for blue cheese, but this stuff was crazy good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years but never managed to get there. That was a mistake! 

We had an order of dry wings and original wings, and both were excellent. The original were a little spicy for my wife's taste, but she still ate every last morsel. I liked them and can't wait to bring my son because he loves spicy food. The dry were some of the best wings I've had. 

The only negatives were that they are cash only and ordering at the bar is a pain when there's only one bartender working on a busy evening. She kept things moving, though, minimizing the wait as much as possible. 

Drink prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best hot wings in the Madison area. Probably the best wings anywhere.

Cash only, 'natch."}
{"text":"Really good wings in a dive bar atmosphere. The bleu cheese sauce that comes with the wings is GREAT."}
{"text":"Got the hook up for this place from our man in Waunakee, Matt W.  (Thanks, Matt!). REVIEW UPSHOT-- I tend to agree with those who believe this may be the best chicken wings in the area.

It is a little out-of-the-way from Downtown and not in Sun Prairie proper. (From Highway 30 off of East Washington it is an easy approximate 15 minute drive). 

It is out in the country on County Highway N and would be easy to blow by if you were not paying attention.  It looks like a sketchy little dive bar off the side of the road with a big parking lot. Actually, it looks like a large ranch style house made into a sketchy little dive bar off the side of the road with a big parking lot.  Once inside, it is a sketchy dark little dive bar off the side of the road with a big parking lot. 

They do not have a large interior space. They have a number of hightop and a couple low top tables and seating at the bar for diners. Maybe 7-10 tables total. 

The menu is on the board and on the napkin holders on the tables. The menu is limited, consisting of a few sandwiches, appetizers and their wings.  They have four different kinds of wings and basic sandwiches (a cheeseburger, fish fillet, pork chop, tenderloin, etc).  Prices are modest. 

Our visit included me, wifey (also known as \"she-who-must-be-obeyed), our 20-year-old and 15-year-old.  Between us, our 15-year-old is the wing and cheeseburger connoisseur. We ordered a basket of their original and dry rub wings, cheese curds, a fish sandwich, cheeseburger, and pork filet sandwich.  (Sandwiches are a la carte). Drinks were waters and two Pepsis. Fries were excellent. The cheese curds were also very good and well sized.  Fish sandwich was surprisingly good. Nice big piece of cod perfectly fried and not greasy in a grilled bakery bun. Ample tartar sauce was provided on the side. 15 year old loved his cheeseburger although wished tomato and lettuce was available.

The wings were also very good. They were all well sized, meaty, flavored very well and cooked to perfection. I don't like soggy and slippery wings that don't seem fully cooked. These had a definite crunch to them but not burnt.  The originals were very spicy but not overly so.  The blue cheese dressing seems housemade. I would have liked a little more blue cheese punch in it. I think these are the best wings I've had in Madison based on meatiness and cooking texhnique. Son disagrees, favoring those at Wing Stop on Regent Street.  He likes having more flavor options. 

We visited on Saturday at 1:30 PM and there were a number of other families, including first-timers like us. I don't know how the night crowd would be and if family friendly. But today in the afternoon, it definitely was. 

Service is fine, too. You order at the bar and pay then (or when you're done). They are prompt to cook your food and bring it and clear plates away for you.  Well done for a place like this. Our complements.  

I think five stars appropriate if they had some condiments and other additions they can add to their sandwiches, i.e. basic lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, onions, etc.  Also, a little more blue cheese oomph in their blue cheese dressing and a couple more wing flavor options or some extra/different sauces on the table.  

Please note though, CASH only. No credit cards or checks accepted. There is an ATM on site.

This place is worth a visit - and to bring your family to--at least in the daylight hours. Perhaps for dinner, too. Probs. We'll be back for sure. 

See you there."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the wings! Another bonus is that the atmosphere is very chill and they've got amazing burgers to boot!"}
{"text":"Yup, it's worth $1 a wing. Great sauce. Nice dive bar  atmosphere. Take a road trip out here and see why the call it world famous."}
{"text":"Best wings ever.....  Original sauce with dry rub....   Also their homemade blue cheese I could drink and the funniest thing is I hate blue cheese!  Great deep fried mushrooms and tater tots as well.  Limited menu, very busy place, no waitresses, you order at the bar, fast service, friendly bartender and so on.  You basically come here for wings and that's that! 
This is one of those hole in the wall style places with literally the best sauced, seasoned, wings this guy has ever had.  I would say for anyone within a 3 state mileage range should drive here to eat these.  It should be on any foodie's bucket list.

Cash only!  ATM is available!"}
{"text":"I have gone here countless times and had great service and great food, except for today. Went in, ordered and while I was waiting several families with children came roughly 20 min after I ordered. Waited roughly an hour from ordering and the families started receiving their food, inquired about my order from waiter and he ran in back and we watched him put our sides in the microwave. Then bring them out. The cheese curds and tater tots were soggy. He said he needed to run back and get the wings, we waited 10 more minutes and by this time we had to leave and the waiter finally brought out the food, I stopped him and got up to leave and paid for my drinks. When I got out to my car the owner drunkenly stormed out and started cussing me out saying he was throwing the food away and told us that he got slammed so we should understand. Then he flipped us the bird and shouted at us to fuck off."}
{"text":"my brother in law got me take out chicken wings from here.  the owner wanted him to stay and eat in as they would be ideally consumed fresh.  well, 10 mins later, they were still piping hot and delicious. i wish i could have tried this place fresh in house. 

the bluecheese ranch with side of celery was amazing. 

go here for the wings off the highway."}
{"text":"Perfect wings and blue cheese sauce for dipping.  My favorite are the dry rub.  

This is in the basement of a house which has been converted to a bar.  A bit shabby, but people go for the food, and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food 4/5
Service 2/5

I mean it's like a local hole in the wall bar what am I really expecting? Original Wing Sauce is top notch stuff. Cash Only."}
{"text":"Wings are great, homemade blue cheese is even better.  Get the original flavor wings which combines dry rub and the sauce.  

Place is packed and it's not because of the decor.  Great hole in the wall bar with good bartenders and wings."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the wings and cold beer, not the shady crowd at the bar or the atmosphere.  The place is a honky tonk that happens to have amazing wings.  Don't make the drive thinking there are a million flavors of wings, Chicken Lips is NOT Buffalo Wild Wings.  I think there are four flavors.  I had the original and the dry rub and both were unique and exciting.  The original sauce seems like it might be chili powder based...whatever it is I am completely in love with it.  Previously my favorite wing on the planet was the Triple Play sauce at the old Anchor Inn.  Totally worth the trip!  Cash only."}
{"text":"Let me explain what to do if you're remotely within driving distance from Madison or Sun Prairie and you want hot wings.

Drive to a deserted country road in the middle of nowhere.  Pull into what looks like a gravel parking lot in front of someone's rundown house.  Walk into what is probably the most scuzzy looking dive bar you've ever been in (unless you're a career drinker, hooker, or gigging musician, in which case this is comparably The Palm).  Bring cash because that's all they take.  Order the original wings (homemade buffalo on top of dry rub) with the homemade bleu cheese (even if you dont like bleu cheese).  Get two orders and an extra sauce.  Leave happy.

Let me be clear.  These arent the best wings in Madison.  The best wings in Madison are the sweet honey chilli glazed wings from That BBQ Joint.  But these are the best hot/buffalo wings I've tried in the area.

I also tried the burger.  It was good, but they didnt have lettuce/tomato/mayo.  It tasted like a burger from when my dad grills out, which is in part a good thing, but when I get a burger from a restaurant, I want it to taste like something I cant get at home.  I am looking forward to trying the other sandwiches.

I've visited twice.  The first time the service was excellent, the second time, kind of rude.  I think it was the same guy.

It really does seem like the place, based on the location and atmosphere, where you would expect to hear: \"We dont want your kind around here BOY!\"  But prior to trying it, I posted on Facebook to see what my friends and family think, and a very very diverse group of people responded that this was their secret wing spot.  So apparently no one need worry.

I pass right buy it every Saturday afternoon on my way home from work.  Two Saturdays in a row I've brought wings home for my wife and I.  I think I'm going to make this an every Saturday tradition."}
{"text":"Friendly, and hardworking, bartender, friendly patrons and KILLER wings! I ordered the original wings, not at all what I expected, but they were outstanding. Will definately be back when I get back to town."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has such high reviews. I was in late Friday night, bartender was more worried about taking as many shots as she could (4 in the half hour I wasted my time here), swearing and talking down customers from shifts before, than taking care of new paying customers. There weren't more than 15 people in the bar, but she was \"so busy\" she couldn't answer the two questions I had about the menu and drinks without giving me a ton of attitude. My group all got their food while she \"forgot\" to bring mine 5 feet to the kitchen (while taking another shot). Lost customers forever and from there the bartender got worse. After a fake apology from the bartender she then asked another customer to go out for a smoke break, came rushing back in when one in my group needed a box, and gave us a ton of attitude, so unprofessional. I've worked in the industry for over a decade and this is by FAR the worst and most unprofessional experience I've ever had. I don't care how great of food or drinks people think you have, the service wouldn't make up for any of it. It's a joke she's in charge of your restaurant, should be fired immediately for taking shots alone. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"My son was told this was the place for the best chicken wings in the greater Madison area; and I will admit, his source was correct.

Some things to understand.  
Cash only!  Bring USD in the wallet or pocket.
It looks like you are driving up to someone's house...be brave and go in.
It is a dive atmosphere, which is not a bad thing, just be ready for that.
You order from the bar and find a seat.  Order drinks first, food second.

And the wings....outstanding taste and favorite.  I was told if I liked spicy or Buffalo, get the original, not the Buffalo.  And they were spicy (my spice tolerance is down) and very tasty, not just the plain pure heat with no favor.  One order is about a pound and a half, or around 12 wings.  The are smaller in size, crispy but not over done and not greasy.  The blue cheese dressing was good too.

We also ordered some cheese curds and enjoyed those as well...not greasy.  My guess is they do a great job at maintaining the cleanliness of their fryers has nothing was overly greasy.

Why not five stars?  For wings only and a cold beer, I would put it five stars."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on our way home.  Local friends said this place has great wings, zero ambiance but good food. Me and a buddy thought we would check it out before the 75 min. Ride home. The front door opens you right into the bar area where they have seating for 20, turn the corner to the right and see 8-9 tables for 30 people. The key to eating here is patience, lots of patience. It was a busy Sat. Night. It took us an hour before we saw our dinner. I was starved and could not wait to dive in to the wings. We ordered deep-fried mushrooms, onion rings and two different baskets of wings, 20 total. One of the baskets had the house sauce, the other the dry rub. Our friends and waitress recommended the dry rub. All in all it was a nice place to eat. 

 I might check out some other places around town next time."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really really did. Everything about it was things I loved..small dive in Wisconsin, limited menu cuz they specialize in what they do have, a real jukebox...I mean it was a really cool little joint!

Only problem...the wings were way too spicy. If you can get past the sauce, the chicken was good, but I wasn't able to finish my plate. The server did say they had a new chef who \"may have put in too much spice,\" but it was enough to make me nervous about trying again. If they had a BBQ wing option or even a milder sauce I would be going there every weekend!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit ridiculous, I mean come on, it's called Chicken Lips. Is it just me, but does the name sound a bit sexual? Chicken Lips is an absolute dive in the middle of now where with shitty service. However, the chicken wings are finger licking good. My friends and I got a basket of the original, dry rub, and buffalo (each basket is $10 for about 10-13 wings). My personal favorites are the original and dry rub. The wings are good and apparently they make their own blue cheese and ranch. Wings are packed with flavor and their homemade white sauces are nice and thick. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is everything the other reviewers indicate - dive bar with some of the best wings I have ever had!  Bring cash, have a PBR on tap to go with the atmosphere and prepare to be happy!"}
{"text":"I've driven past Chicken Lips twice a day for years. It's in the middle of nowhere just outside of Sun Prairie along rural Highway N and has the look from the outside that conjures images of visitors named Jethro wearing camouflage and driving a Ford F150 pickup truck with a gun rack in the window. But look closer and you'll find that the parking lot is PACKED everyday with upscale SUV's and German-made luxury sedans. 

Then one day a friend told me the place had been named as the BEST chicken wings in the country by some publication. So, yesterday I finally wheeled up the dirt driveway and among the already filled parking lot at 5:30 pm on a Thursday. When you walk in this place one thing occurs to you - what a dump. Bleak, fluorescent lighting, loud, terrible music blaring from a juke box, a rather dingy linoleum floor, and a small, really small, bar just past the screen door. When I asked what kind of vodka they had the bartender said \"those,\" pointing to one bottle of Absolute an one bottle of Tito's on a glass shelf just under the acoustic tile ceiling.

We didn't know the system, so we sat at a table and waited for a server only to finally be told by some regulars devouring their third plate of wings that we needed to order at the bar and tell them our table number. There are other items on the menu, but we wanted to know what these wings were about, so we ordered our first two plates (plates of wings are $10 and there's about 10 on there). We ordered dry rub and original. 

Original wings are sauced with a spicy sauce that is less traditional Buffalo and more cayenne and vinegar New Orleans. Dry rub uses a proprietary 23-ingredient rub. We took our first bites. OH. MY. GOD. It was quickly apparent why that lot out front is always full. These things are amazingly good. The flavor of the original is a punch-in-the face tangy, spicy delicious. The dry rub is a bit more subtle with salty, herby and all-spice hints. Both were nothing short of addictive. Each plate comes with two, small celery sticks. Want more? It'll cost you 50 cents. 

Two plates turned into six.

We ordered the blue cheese as the dip. It really is more of a dip than dressing and appears to be buttermilk based as opposed to sour cream. It had huge chunks of blue cheese in it. My only suggestion for improvement would be to add more celery to the plate. It helps to have a contrasting texture and a bit of something to put out the fire other than the free-flowing beer. 

Other than that, I'd say they stick chicken wings the way Nadia Comaneci stuck the balance beam - a perfect 10. I'll be back - A LOT."}
{"text":"As Anthony Bourdain would say:... \"Freakishly Good\" WINGS!!
I stopped in recently one afternoon on my meanderings home from Madison because I heard they had some of the best wings in Wisconsin... Well, the reviews were wrong, they have THE best wings in Wisconsin!!
Had a nice visit with Steve, the Owner/Chef, (ask him about his time in Europe earning his chops...) and, the bartender/server/all around sweety, Sara, (Personality to SPARE, and absolutely lovely as well!)
Anyway, I explained that I liked things HOT, HOT, HOT after a couple decades in living SoCal and exploring chili heaven... so they recommended \"Hot Level 2\" wings... 
I'm not sure if they were the hottest they offer but I have NEVER had better! 
I got an order to go and while exiting the parking lot, I figured I'd try just one while they were still warm. Well, I didn't make it 5 miles before I had eaten them all - while driving - !
VERY tempted to turn around for another order but running late so, alas... NEXT TIME, and EVERY TIME I pass by that way I will stop in!!
See you guys soon ;^)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here after another thing fell through. Well we were pleasantly suprised. I guess Wednesday is a really busy day and we hit it right at the peak of business. Well it was a bit of a wait,you expect when a place has 1 bartender working with a place full of about at least 40 or 50 people. All in different stages of ordering,some need drinks,others need to make first order of wings, and some need to pay. Well that said the place runs rather smooth. You will wait for wings and I will agree they are pretty good. We ordered the original and spicy both done to our satisfaction. Will be back"}
{"text":"Executive summary:  wings are fantastic, atmosphere is small town dive bar, restroom is slightly creepy, ample parking.  Read on for my full review.

I am mostly vegetarian.  I make an exception for certain seafood and now, for Chicken Lips wings.  Apparently, this place wins local awards for their wings.  They might wing national awards too but the owner says he's never entered the national contests.

They have a secret recipe dry rub (my favorite), buffalo style sauce, and a combo dry rub buffalo sauce option for your wings.  They also have a house made blue cheese dressing which is fantastic...and I don't usually like blue cheese AT ALL.  They have ranch too if you prefer.

They've also got the usual bar apps: onion rings, cheese curds, mushrooms, and sandwiches, shrimp etc. too but the real reason to come here is the wings.

Warning: they are a tavern.  They don't serve coffee or tea.  The guy actually laughed when we asked about coffee.  They have alcohol.  And soda or water, if you ask nicely.

Warning: they are a dive bar.  I like dive bars myself but if you're going to be offended that the single seater women's bathroom has a condom dispenser (rugged and ready studded condoms no less) and a chalkboard with \"SUCK D*CK\" scrawled across it you're going to want to order carry out.  But, yeah, you still gotta try these wings!

My friend from Buffalo was near tears.  She hasn't found a wing place this good since she left NY.  12 wings for $9....awesome.  And the food came out fast.  

The server, well, he's what I would expect at a dive bar.  Friendly, but in a  \"yes, I'm laughing at you...why would you expect to order coffee at a bar\" kind of way.

Ample parking.  Actually, it seems they have way more space for cars in the lot than people in the restaurant.  They weren't busy the night we were there, a non-football Sunday around 5 or 6pm, but with only a few tables and the bar I imagine it gets full quickly.

I live on the far west side but I will make the trek to Sun Prairie for these wings again soon!  Thank goodness I have a friend in the area.  I can pretend I came to visit then casually suggest a trip to Chicken Lips for dinner.  Shhhhh....don't tell."}
{"text":"Best. Wings. In Madison. Period. Only takes cash so be prepared. Blue Cheese I thought at first was a little sweeet but my second trip I embraced the sweet and I love it now. Any preparation of wings is great, I've tried them all."}
{"text":"Love these wings. Best we've had in the Madison area. The dry rub on the original wings is amazing. Goes great with the blue cheese and cheese curds."}
{"text":"The best wings in Madison. Period. Point. That's all.  If you haven't been here I would say find a reason to go ASAP.  Chicken Lips is a hole in the wall far away from Madison and close to Sun Prairie.  The place is totally no frills.  I mean there is literally nothing impressive about the location.  But that doesn't matter because it's the food that you are here for.  They have the smallest menu that I have even seen.  It is literally a few sandwiches, fries, onion rings, and 4 flavors of wings.  

The chicken here are amazing though!  They are perfectly crisp, not too spicy, and have the perfect amount of sauce.  I have been to a ton of other wing places here and they can't hold a flame to this place. I typically order the original because they are best sometimes however when I am feeling a little wild I order the dry rub.  The dry rub is great but the original is where its at.

We rarely leave Sun Prairie without making a pit stop at this place as well!"}
{"text":"Hidden along the highway between I-94 and Sun Prairie is this tiny little house and bar.  A faded sign bosts the silly name- \"Chicken Lips\".  

Inside, you'll find a stained suspended ceiling, multiple video poker machines, a few beer signs and some of the best chicken wings you'll taste!  They offer four kinds of wings, original- which is covered in a type of red hot sasuce, interesting flavor.  Dry Rub- and incredibly flavorful dusting of spices!  Buffalo and Naked, I didn't try the last two but I think the name speak for themselves.  The fellow behind the bar stated the wings are fried fresh, are never more than 2-3 days old, and provided by a local purveyor.  The menu offers other things, like waffle fries and burgers, but why would you?  The bartender said last year they went through over 40,000 lbs of wings.

Chicken lips- stupid name, great wings!"}
{"text":"Yup! This was everything everyone said it was. Wasn't very busy on a Saturday afternoon so service was fast. Ordered dry rub and buffalo wings with the tots + dry rub. My fiancé was super weary about ordering blue cheese but I told him we had to based on other reviews. We're glad we did.  

The bartender was great. Efficient and incredibly polite. I have a soft spot for people with proper manners =) This will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Chicken Lips wings, and on the advice of others on this site, opted for \"Original\" style.
What I can't believe no one mentioned, is this is a very different taste from any hot wing I've ever had. I'm not sure what the herbs/spices are, but it's taste seems like Indian curry. But it is good, damn good!
What I really respect is that the owners had the courage to do something unique.
I was reading about Dickey's Barbecue the other day, and almost every review said \"ok, but nothing special\", and having been a restaurant owner for over 10 years, I know why that is. They are shooting for a taste that is \"acceptable\" to most people. It's a money move, not a culinary move.
This guy at Chicken Lips made a conscious decision to make the best wings, period, taking a chance that some people might not like them.
I say BRAVO! And the bleu cheese sauce is made in house, again BRAVO!
In closing, can't understand all the postings about \"it's a dive\" and \"it's a hole in wall\". What I saw was a very clean, nice bar. From the outside it does look a bit sketchy (random cardboard boxes covering a window), but is that really important? Maybe they should put some ferns in there, or slick looking stainless steel to assuage the more discriminating clientele, but for me, I'll just keep eatin' them wings!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place!  My friend wanted to show me this restaurant as colleagues introduced the place.  Outside it looks like a ranch style house you would drive by it and not even realize it was a bar/restaurant.  Inside is very old school and country like.  They have a jukebox and stuff you would find from the 80s.  DONT go into the bathroom!  The wigs were good.  We ordered the original wings they come by weight so get prepared.  The original was good, it was their own secret recipe and not too spicy.  If you order then \"sexy\" they're really hot so be prepared"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I made the drive to Sun Praire for both the experience and the food at Chicken Lips.

Definitely divey - it looks like a house and is surrounded by farms. It's a bar with jukeboxes, games and dim lighting. No frills whatsoever; it seems like a place where SP locals come to hang out. 

We walked in and everyone was super friendly. The bartender helped us decided what to order: we ended up getting the original and the dry rub wings, the chips and the cheese curds. The chips and cheese curds came out first and were great appetizers. They are coated in the same rub as the chicken; so even though the actual curds and chips weren't the best I've tried (in terms of texture/factors besides seasoning); they were definitely tasty. Then the wings came and they were super yummy. I couldn't decide if I liked the original (saucy, kind of like buffalo wings) or the dry rub better so I had plenty of both. They went great with their original bleu cheese (apparently diluted with sour cream \"or something\"), which apparently \"mama\" invented because bleu cheese was too expensive. 

I'm glad I went, but I'm not sure I agree that these are the best wings ever or even the best wings in town. Regardless, the food is very good and the experience is a hoot."}
{"text":"Best wings in the world. Combine buffalo wings with their own house-made dry rub and... well words just don't describe."}
{"text":"Best. Wings. Ever. Tried the dry rub wings and their sauced wings and loved them both. Shared some apps with the table also and they were all really good. I will most definitely be back and will most definitely recommend Chicken Lips to friends. 

The place is quite divey. The music was a bit too loud, but it was mostly good music. Not a country fan but whatever country was played was older so it was bearable. Service was great."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in town. Don't be fooled by how much of a dive this place is. They have these dry rub wings that are super freak'n delicious! They make strong drinks as well....."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken wings (original is my fav, includes a dry run and buffalo sauce) & best bleu cheese, which is homemade and available for purchase!"}
{"text":"The wings could be meatier, but the dry rub and sauce cant get much better! Order the waffle fries with the dry rub on them too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"There is definitely nothing fancy about the decor or inside of Chicken Lips, but as the name implies its all about the chicken here. Inside is your stereotypical dive/country bar. The drinks are fairly priced so that is always nice.  It is cash only so keep that in mind, but they do have an atm onsite in case you forget. 

Now to the chicken. The food is very good. The chicken wings are some of the best I have had. The only bad thing I have encountered is I have gotten a stomach ache sometimes, but the again I have a very sensitive stomach. They have different sauce and dry rub selections you can choose from. My favorite is the original sauce and is does have a kick. They also make there own blue cheese dressing to go with in house, that is to die for.

Overall give Chicken Lips a  try if you are a chicken wing fan."}
{"text":"If you need some wings and are in the Madison area you need to get yourself here. These are some of the best in the area by far. They have your traditional buffalo wings, however, original is the way to go as the dry rub here is fantastic and elevates the wing to a whole new level. Price is decent at about $10 for a 12-15 wings. I can see why people come here early and often.

The bleu cheese that everyone raves of here - I cannot say the same. It tasted more like if bleu cheese met cream cheese as it wasn't strong enough for me, however, people who find traditional bleu off-putting may find this sweetened alternative more to their liking. 

We also had the waffle fries which were just okay by me. It was a rather small bowl for $4 and came with a sweetened white dressing. I asked for the \"dry rub\" sprinkle but found myself lacking here. 

Like so many others, I'll be back for the wings!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Saturday night with a group of 5 to finally try the wings. 

Tasty and decent priced all around.

We had an order of each of the four flavors of wings (Original, Dry Rub, Buffalo, and Nude).  They were all delicious - dry rub was my fave. 

Also had homemade chips (yum!), cheese curds (decent), and fried mushrooms (meh). One in the party also had a burger which she said was very good. 

Decent service. Bartender was efficient, but not really friendly. Cook/delivered our wings to the table was friendly and brought us water and napkins (thanks!!). 

Good prices, great wings."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. Pass the time waiting for your to go order with the drunk guy at the bar. Had a good assortment of the types of wings and none were decent. Meh.....won't be back."}
{"text":"A tiny hole in the wall bar , but don't let that fool ya .. the wings with blue cheese dressing are awesome!! A nice find in a small place. The staff is friendly and prices are good! Will go there again and again"}
{"text":"Total dive but that's what is to love about it. Loud music from the jukebox, friendly crowd, and a pool table. Be prepared to order at the bar but service is very quick. Cash only but they do have an atm. The wing sauces are phenominal and everything else I've gotten (fried food side options) have been well prepared and crispy and hot when brought out. Perfect amount of food for your money too!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about this place.... The wings are OK at best in my opinion. They're very small with not very much meat. I had the original wings with the homemade blue cheese which was very good, along with a side of waffle fries. The wings are said to be a pound and a half total, and I was given 11 of the very small wings. Definitely wouldn't total the weight I was told. 

The service was very good and was the best thing about this place. I went in with very high expectations given they have a nearly perfect 5 score on Yelp, and sorry to say I was disappointed. If the wings lived up to the hype I would've frequented this place...."}
{"text":"When you pull up to this place, you might be tempted to leave based on the appearance, as it literally looks like a house on the side of an old country road. APPEARANCES ARE SO DECEIVING, FRIENDS. 
These were the best darn chicken wings I have ever had in my life. My friend and I shared the original (dry rub AND sauce) and just the dry rub. We also ordered a basket of waffle fries with dry rub on them. WOW. I was so impressed by this food. BE WARNED THAT ALL THE FOOD HAS A KICK, SO THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! The ambiance is so rustic and casual and tacky but I love it. The beer and food selection is limited, but definitely does the trick. I cannot tell you how amazed and impressed I was with this place. I just moved to Middleton, so I am still learning the area and finding good places to eat and I am so glad I made the hike to Chicken Lips!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken wings in the Madison area.  The people are very friendly and prices were good for what you get.  I absolutely recommend coming out on a free night to enjoy some wings and beer with friends.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, caught the basketball game and had a wonderful time. The bartender was amazing, friendly, and hard working. They gave me suggestions and told me about their food, I ordered the original wings and the dry rub, and they were both amazing. 

The owner sat and chatted with us, told us about the recipes and that we had to get the house made blue cheese dressing. Everything was amazing, the food was great, everyone was super friendly, if your looking for a great place to watch a game, have conversation with strangers, and have a great beer!"}
{"text":"I don't say this lightly, but these are the best tasting wings in the Madison area. Hands down. Lazy for those who don't like anything too hot, Sexy for the daring. Dry rub plus sauce. Bartender was top notch and I can't wait to go back for them again. There really isn't anything that comes close. Price is fine-looks dicey on the outside but fine in the inside. Cheese curds are not stellar"}
{"text":"Wow!  Hands down the best wings in town.  Walked in, expecting nothing.  The wings were orgasmic!  Friendly staff really enjoyed this place.  Until Hank walked in.  I don't know where he had been eating, but it wasn't at Chicken Lips, and it was not sitting well with him.  He nearly cleared the bar with the unpleasant odor seeping from his nether region."}
{"text":"Wait, what? 60/68 reviews claim these are \"wisconsin's best wings\" I also heard it 4 times from the drunk guy in the corner while waiting on our order. Have these 60 people never ventured outside bw3s? We live an hour away and was passing through, and I recently read an article on FB about off the beaten path wings and this place was listed. So hey, we stopped for an early dinner. 430...wasn't crowed, but holy hell this place is a dump. It's literally the bottom of a house that looks like it should of been condemned years ago. The ceilings tiles are falling out and/or misplaced and stained. The ventilation above our table had about 2 years of dust/grease/chicken lips in it. The bathrooms aren't bad but lots of graffiti and a chalkboard again reminding you they are wisconsin's best wings. Ok enough already.... 

You can grab a table and order from the nicotine stained sign. Basically you get a pound and a half (11) small half bred wings with your choice of hot, med, mild. The medium is a dry rub that they claim is the \"most popular\" so we ordered those, with a side of poppers. The poppers had an option for \"dry rub\" and we felt rebellious and agreed to try that. Sat back down and waited about 5 mins. The poppers came out in a small bowl with a paper liner. They were your basic deep fried poppers from a pub. The dry rub was a ok touch. 

Our wings arrived shortly after. They were a lot smaller than I had thought and like I mentioned earlier...there were some questionable pieces in there. Broken bones, just the top of the drummy pieces. At least serve your customers some good looking wings? Anyhow the rub has little to no flavor. It's not medium. It's sparing added. If you can taste the grease from the fry - that's not a famous wing. Sorry CL! 

Overall, they weren't BAD but they definitely do not live up to their claim!! 

Won't return."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy date restaurant. This is a local watering hole with incredible chicken wings. Please get the Dry Rub with their home made Bleu Cheese and waffle fries. Not because they are spicy, but because they taste like 30 ingredients perfectly balanced together!"}
{"text":"Amazing, unique, and fresh wings.  If atmosphere is important to you, then go elsewhere.  But if you are all about the food, then this is the place for you.  I dragged my lady (who loves wings) to this dive bar in the middle of nowhere.  She was very skeptical until she had a wing.  Apparently now we have to go there every Sunday for football.  Great great wings."}
{"text":"Chicken Lips is to die for.  Yes, you heard me.

This is a rare joint, one of those off the beaten path places that is a journey to get to and has a story to precede it.  I kept getting descriptions from people such as \"some dude's crazy house\" or \"TOTAL DIVE\" to \"I heard the wings were incredible\"

Well, after weeks of anticipation (and a little concern), I finally arrived at what my wife and I lovingly call \"the lip\" a few months ago.  I've been back several times since, and I think the end result is a mix of all the stories, but absolutely for the best.

First, it is a converted house.  It is a dive.  It is on a highway out in the middle of the cornfields of Sun Prairie.  But they have a bar.  They have TVs.  The TVs have the game on.

And most importantly, they have wings that will send you to heaven and back, make you go home and want to come back tomorrow.  The original sauce on the wings is a crack addiction if I've ever seen one, and if you can handle the spice of that and want some more, you can order just about infinite levels of sexy (habenero powder if I remember correctly).  Yes, the spicier wings are called \"Extra Sexy\".  The waffle fries with the original seasoning are a party in your mouth, and I've heard good things about the chips which I have yet to try.  

But let us not forget the holy ingredient; the blue cheese.  Their blue cheese should come with a warning label.  Forgive me, as I have a bias since I already am a big blue cheese and wings fan, but this blue cheese is the real deal, the thrilla from manilla, you will order it with your meal and your sides, and you will be scraping the cup with said sides.

Alright, drama over.  Chicken Lips is awesome, if you like wings and are capable of going to a dive bar with no frills for them, here you will find a great time.  Prices are fine, service is friendly (the owner is sometimes around and is always cool beans), and heck make a lil' adventure out of it.  Just remember to bring cash, as they do not accept cards.  

Sorry got to go, I'm walking out the door right now for a return visit. . ."}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had.  This place is a beautiful dive bar with some kick arse wings!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem! I had never been before so I wasn't sure of what to expect. 

When you walk in you can tell right away this place is a dive. It appears to be in the basement of an old duplex? Not sure exactly. It's pretty simple and shows it's wear - but don't let that fool you. It's great! 

We went for the chicken. My friend just RAVES about this chicken so I went in with high expectations. I was not disappointed! I'm not a huge fan of spicy, so to be safe I went with the naked wings. She got the dry rub. If I return I will get the dry rub for sure. Soooo goooood! The home
made blue cheese is amazing. I'm not typically a fan of blue cheese but this stuff - I could slather it on anything. I mixed the house buffalo sauce into it and that was perfect. 

They had sports playing on all the tvs. Very laid back, relaxed atmosphere.  Woman's room features one of those old school condom dispensers on the wall haha. 

Cash only, but there is an atm! 

Bartenders and staff all very friendly as well!"}
