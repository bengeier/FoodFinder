Late lunch today as usual (almost same meal all five dines) Italian Stallion Deli Sandwich, \"Daisy's\" Black and White Cookie and Lemon Italian Ice!

The Italian Stallion is: Prosciutto, Cappi, Salami, Provolone, Tomato, one piece of Lettuce (non-iceberg) and Banana Peppers, with the best Balsamic I've had, on the best bread I've had anywhere!  This is my favorite Italian Deli style sandwich anywhere!!!  I have had a lot of sandwiches and none come close to this!!!  With meats from: Block & Barrel, Silver Source and Daniele... Incredible!

Best Sandwich!  Best Black and White Cookie and Best Italian Ice!!!  The Service is Incredible and the place has tremendous Charm!  Worth the drive!!!  See my photos!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and personable folks. They have a nice selection of salads and sandwiches. I ordered the tomato mozzarella sandwich and it was pretty tasty. Will definitely go back to try other things. Outdoor seating available too."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here today for lunch - and I confess it was a let-down. I ordered a Tomato Basil Sandwich and a soda, and it was 9 bucks, which seems a bit on the expensive side for cheese, tomato, pesto with bread and a soda. My colleague ordered a sub and it seemed to take forever to cook. 

Great look on the inside, and I love the patio seating - as for the food and the price - Meh."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed with this place. We were looking for a quick lunch and my wife mentioned she would like a good deli sandwich. I remembered seeing this place on the way home from work one night so I thought we'd give it a try. When we went inside I was actually expecting a whole lot more. The setting was nice and the staff was pleasant. The menu was appealing as well, we both got the jersey shore sandwich, my wife got Hers with potato salad and I opted for the pasta salad. First problem was it took them 30 minutes to make 2 sandwiches. We were tired of sitting there so we opted to take them to go and eat at home. The sandwiches tasted okay but we're very skimpy on the meats for the prices they charged. The sides were very small and not that good either, you could tell they had been sitting out too long. Needless to say I won't go back which is disappointing because I have really been looking for a good deli here in concord."}
