{"text":"This is a good place to try. I work in the area so I've had them for lunch.  I think there fries and gravy are the best.  Very tasty. I've had the cheeseburger wasn't very impressed.  So when I do go I go back to my default....  Fries and gravy."}
{"text":"My wife and I had enjoyed Opa many times over the 7 years we have lived in Las Vegas. We eat out very often, and Mediterranean/Greek/Lebanese is a regular on our favorite fare. Yesterday (10-2-13) was my birthday. We could have gone to one of our favorite \"Fine Dinning\" haunts. But instead, I thought we could do something different and go to Plaka and check them out. I could go on with many details about this experience, but decided it would take way too long. All I can say is, the only thing that resembles Opa, or any other fine Greek dining experience is the decor. It had to be bar none the worst food and overall experience we have had in a long time. If you are looking for Greek/Mediterranean go elsewhere! There are plenty of other choices."}
{"text":"Our food was poor at least took forever to get our food it came cold and over done. The waiter was poor service sucked they need to go to Chicago Greek Town and learn how it's done. Food is over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"I work in the area and came for lunch and was unimpressed with the food. I had the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner and it was mediocre and a poor value at $13.55. The service was exceptionally fast because none of the items were made to order... Specifically  about the meal: the potatoes and rice were significantly overcooked, the salad was soggy and overdressed and the chicken was under seasoned and the tzatziki had very little garlic and lemon.  Overall I would not recommend coming here if you are looking for decent Greek food. I feel as though this restaurant lacks fresh ingredients and poorly executes on their meals. It may be a place to go if you are interested in quantity, but care little about the quality of your food."}
{"text":"Food is very good. We ordered fish and chips. Price is reasonable We arrived at one, very busy, you could see the manager was under a lot of pressure and not happy with the other workers performance, but the customers should not see that. After a hectic day, we want to see happy people's serving food, train them after and everything will be perfect"}
{"text":"This place is very busy at lunch. I recommend calling ahead to order. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner with fries. It was really good and a hefty portion - still ate it all though! The tzatziki isn't the best I've ever had but was still really good. If you are a big tzatziki fan / a saucy person like me then ordering extra tzatziki sauces is a must. I ordered 2 extra and finished it all. My meal including a drink came out to about $16 so it's somewhat pricey for lunch but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch as it's close to my office.  It's always busy, so expect a line up.  They are usually pretty fast considering how busy it is.   Food is really tasty as well. Meals are usually around $10 before tax."}
{"text":"Very poor service....we usually go to the Mad Greek for Greek food but decided to try a new place.  It is very quiet on a Friday night with only 5 other customers and 2 waiters.  We got the waiter who really is probably 80+ yrs old...we ordered humus and we waited over 10 minutes after our pita bread was cold and had to ask another waiter to get it.  The food was fair, not great.  Our waiter went to a table he was not serving to talk to the customer over 5 times,  but never checked on us.  He never asked for drink refills on our beer or how the food was. ....not coming back here again..."}
{"text":"My husband goes here a lot for lunch and absolutely loves it!  He said they even do up a really good bacon and eggs breakfast with home fries and all the fixings. He brings me home cheeseburgers ever now and then and it's so old school good - better than Johnny's Hamburgers in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Plaka is a great lunch spot. It does get very busy during lunch so I recommend going earlier to grab a spot or for take out (lines are usually long and take a while to process everyone's order).  I always grab a Chicken Souvlaki wrap and fries. Their chicken is always well done and the tzatziki sauce is great. Their fries are average (that like any other diner)."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent personal service. I really enjoyed the vegetarian plate and Greek wine. This was my first visit but won't be my last."}
{"text":"This place doesn't know what it wants to be- formal dining, smooth Greek music lounge, or quick sandwiches. S-L-O-W service (probably the formal dining experience they're shooting for), and ok food. Nothing spectacular. There's also a Greek mafia feel to the place (I don't even know if that's a thing), but there are various older gentlemen around wearing gold chains and button-down shirts half unbuttoned who seem to be doing \"business\"."}
{"text":"This eatery is within walking distance from my workplace. I go there now and again for lunch on Fridays.   There are specials posted on a whiteboard. There is always fish on Fridays, so you're fine if you're looking for a fish fry. I have had it and it's good.   I tend to come here for either the hamburger platter, a salad, or souvlaki. Everything is made-to-order. The food is solid..   The head chef can get animated whether there are plenty of orders and they seem to be lagging. He talks louder to his staff. My colleague once described it as being shouting. I don't know. It does get noisy in there. When the craziness dies down, he is the first person to thank you for stopping by.     It's a good place to get what you want for lunch and head back to work.   (45)"}
{"text":"This is a great little greasy-spoon kind of Greek place by my work.  The food is a little pricy for lunch but none the less it fills you up.  They need to work on their consistency a little as my co-worker and I ordered almost exactly the same thing and she got twice as many potatoes.  Tasty, tasty potatoes...."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! The new look is wonderful. The food was amazing!  The usual Greek fare with a few twists.  Fried zucchini with skordalia, oh my gosh what a wonderful treat. The avgolemono was delish, maybe a little more lemon juice could've been added.  The entrees were scrumptious, hubby had the combination platter, all his faves.  I opted for the Greek chicken and wasn't disappointed. I hope Plaka is around for a long time as I intend to be a regular customer! The waiter we had also worked for the family that owned OPA, he has some amazing serving skills that are worth noting! G"}
