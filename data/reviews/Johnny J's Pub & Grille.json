{"text":"Food , service, and atmosphere are a 1000% improvement from the previous establishment at that location.  Definitely one of my favorites"}
{"text":"Good place for a beer and the game the staff do a great job at taking care of the customers and the food is not bad at all good beer selection"}
{"text":"If you like MMA wannabe dudes and known criminals around you as you try to enjoy a night out this is your place."}
{"text":"I used to eat lunch here quite often and was always pleased with the food and the service was prompt - never super busy at lunch..  Recently the quality has deteriorated significantly.  Today I was served cold fries and a cold chicken sandwich.  When I told my server she offered to replace them but I was already and hour and 15 minutes into the ordeal.  My last several visits have gone the exact same way.

Very disappointing trend."}
{"text":"This is a cool place and I always have fun. The foot face bar tender threw me off, but way better looking ones came. The BBQ they have here is a little crappy but still. I love johnny js I need it in me."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and good quality. The Jameson burger is a good pick. This place wont break your budget and the beer list is very very big. The service is attentive and friendly, the wings are also tasty. If you want to watch a sports game/event, come here as they have many TVs."}
{"text":"The food here is above average bar fare. The bartenders are friendly. I'm boxing my food and leaving early to go elsewhere though because the wifi is down. The manager said \"his phone is working\" and he dismissed and ignored me. There's other places in town that care a little more. Otherwise it's a typical bar."}
{"text":"Wednesday's $3.00 specialty drinks is a plus. Food, drinks and service were excellent. Love the Caramel Mochatini and the Mango Cosmo."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks, fast service, but cold staff.
Ambience is good for a sports bar."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! The prices are great. And the inside decor is unbelievable. By far the best place to go with friends for drinks. We went up friday nite and sat nite for drinks. The servive was great and the drinks were flowing quickly. We met a couple of the owners James and Jeff and Dan who are very professional as they are helping their staff with the busy nite. And going table to table greeting everyone, very nice guys!
   Later into the nite the place has a dj and dance lights and an area made clear for dance floor and the place gets jumpin. Naturally the girls and i hit the dance floor!! This is a definite upgrade for Strongsville finally a place for a Night Life."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately but no one came to our table for over 15 minutes.   I had to go ask if a server was assigned to us at all.   Our order was finally taken.   Food was ok.  Not bad but not the best we've ever had.  We all ordered burgers & fries.   Beer selection was good but they were out of what we wanted."}
{"text":"Tried to come here once and had a negative service experience.  We sat down and began to order drinks when a man tapped on my fianc√©s shoulder and asked if he could have his seat back. She stood up, explaining she didn't know it was saved. I then looked to the bar tender that stated, \"he always sits here.\" We began trying to find somewhere else to sit but realized it wasn't worth our business and left"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...Rob our waiter was FANTASTIC and the steak special was AMAZING! Will DEFINITELY go back!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night . Food was horrible as well as the service. Staff is very cold . Will never go back ."}
{"text":"I was impressed by Johnny J's.   The food was well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere was lively and the music was good.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came in for a weekday lunch. Although there was plenty of help and the crowd was small, service was slow. Took a while to get served and forever to get our check.   We then ordered, only to find out later they were out of half what we asked for. 

The food, overall, was mediocre. The Collins burger was good, and the buffalo chicken dip was very good. The chips appeared to be homemade and were light and crispy. 

Got chili with a club sandwich wrap. The chili had a lot of meat, but no flavor. Ground beef, beans, and a thin tomato sauce. No onions, cheese or flavor for that matter. And the wrap kinda sucked. Lunch meet wrapped around tasteless avocado and too many chopped hard boiled eggs. 

I have had the wings here before, and they were very good. Done experimenting."}
{"text":"Heard they were looking to open a place in Strongsville, so I stopped in for lunch to give it a try. 

First mistake I made was not ordering the Thursday special:  $7.99 sirloin steak with 2 sides. I saw about a dozen of them brought out to others and they looked awesome. 

What I did get was a lunch special; mile high grilled cheese and loaded fries. Both were very good. I'm a French fry snob, and I thought they were great! 

Bartender was a bit slow and casual in her approach.  Turns out she had worked in this spot for 7 years under 3 different names. Not overly excited to be here, which really turns me off. 

Tap beer selection is great. Looking forward to them coming to the ville!

And then I went to pay. This four-star review became two stars. I was charged a one dollar up charge for the loaded fries, although the lunch special clearly indicated that was part of the deal.  When I pointed that out to the lackadaisical bartender, she changed the check and apologized.  I then pointed out the menu said nothing about the sandwich only being half a sandwich and the tortilla chips that were described in the platter were never delivered.

The only reason this wasn't a one star is because Mama Jo's pies is just down the strip."}
{"text":"Met a work colleague here for a recent lunch get together.  I know that this spot recently turned over from another restaurant (of a similar name) and wanted to give them a try.  I ordered off their special lunch menu insert where you can mix-n-match two dishes.

I decided to try the chicken, broccoli and rice main dish with a side of loaded pub fries.  Our server was prompt with drink orders and was attentive throughout the meal.  The main (chicken) dish was fairly tasty...grilled chicken breast over a bed of seasoned rice, smothered in a broccoli cheese soup type of topping.  It was fairly \"gooey\" but flavorful if not a bit salty.  The pub fries were a generous portion topped with a liquid nachos cheese, bacon bits and green onions.  These fries were way too salty but the flavors (together) were a nice combo with the spice of the nacho cheese and the smokey bacon.

Pricing was reasonable, and I've seen several \"deals\" in the local Strongsville mail inserts which made the meal very affordable.  If they could cut down a bit on the over-salting of the food, this place could be pretty solid!  Next time there, I'm gonna give their wings a try..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always good. Their nachos with chicken are really good although the chicken is a peach color which seems unusual. Their wait staff is usually running around but not very attentive. I'm not sure if it's because they are understaffed or they just don't care."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Bartenders are attentive and friendly. Food is good. We've had everything from appetizers to steak. The steak was really tender.  Best bar steak I've had in a while!  Worth a stop if you are in the area. It can be crowded on the weekend nights which is great for them, not so great if you are hungry and ready to eat."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good; average prices.  Surprised though they had no dessert when we asked for a dessert menu.  Seemed odd."}
{"text":"Really irritated with today's visit. We sat ourselves because no one was at the door to seat us (and the sign indicated we should do so) and then waited for anyone to notice us. 
No idea who our \"server\" ultimately was but she came over with menus and asked us for our drink orders. When I asked for a draft list (on National Beer Day) she said they didn't have one. Not sure if that was lazy BS or not but I've never been to another JJs that didn't have a draft list (including previous visits to this one). She told me I could walk up to the bar to look at the taps. So Danielle and I just ordered soft drinks then waited again for those drinks while our buxom brunette server disappeared then reappeared several minutes later checking on other tables without our drinks. Ultimately we just left. 
I used to be a regular at the Valley location which started slipping when this location opened. Now this place is following the same trend. 
It'd be forgivable if the food was anything special but outside of one or 2 things it's all pretty blah. Even their wing sauces all taste the same. 
Unless I hear the they have 120 Minute IPA again, I'm likely done with this location for a while."}
{"text":"I've been going to Johnny Js bar for quite some time at the Springfield location. If you are familiar with the area there is NOTHING else around so no competition. It's clean, new and lots of tvs. But, the service is terrible every time you go to Johnny Js you never know who your server is, 3 different waitresses see you no matter what location.

Just moved to Medina and have been to Johnny Js 4 times now since it is so close to my apartment. It is the exact same story with the waitress not really understanding the concept of how a restaurant works and having a certain section. I still saw 3 different waitresses for the same table, I have never seen that anywhere else before.

Now to the point of this article. Brandon works at the medina location and stay away everybody because he doesn't like criticism. I put $20 in the jukebox and asked the waitress after an hour of not hearing a song what the deal was, she told me the owner likes to play his own music... 2 hours later I hadn't heard a song on a slow Saturday night noticing no one put money in the jukebox. I assumed the owner was playing his own stuff. I wanted my money back or at least an explanation. I asked Brandon if the owner was playing his own music. He said they have no control over the music at the bar. Which is odd because any bar has control over the music and the waitress just told me the owner likes to play his own music. I told him exactly what the waitress told me. I'm in sales in amish country so I understand being respectful and having an honest conversation.

We simply told Brandon we have been here for over 2 hours, the place is dead and we haven't heard one song. He said don't raise your voice at me and walked away from us. He is supposedly the \"manager\". The job of a manager is to solve problems.....Brandon just walked away from a paying customer without an explanation or even an apology, Absolutely nothing. Needless to say the service at Johnny Js is sub par.

Also Brandon at medina Johnny Js will not take care of any issue you have at Johnny Js.  Not sure he is manager quality."}
{"text":"I had heard about the Johnny J's in Medina from a friend who swore by their wings and have been wanting to try it ever since so tonight was the night. We were seated immediately and our waitress came over to take our drink order and returned fairly quickly. Then....she disappeared....for 15 minutes. When she came back she apologized but it was clear she had forgotten about us. Anyway, I got my wings, my wife did the \"build your own burger\". The food came out hot and fairly quickly. Well let me just say...I found my new wing spot in the Strongsville/Brunswick area. Spicy garlic and Johnny J's special sauce which can best be described as a kicked up BBQ sauce were nothing remarkable but tasty. I was more impressed that somehow, some way, someone figured out how to properly cook a chicken wing in Northeast Ohio. They were perfectly crisp and I didn't even have to request them that way. Amazing Johnny J's...simply amazing. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her burger and the fries were crispy and seasoned well. Other than the opening issue the service bounced back and overall we had a good experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wife and I walked in around 6:30 on a Saturday. Place was really busy and jamming, but managed to be seated right away. Server was quick to get our drink order. Great menu selection for everyone. Server advised kitchen was backed up, but food still came out within a pretty quick to normal wait time. We had the buffalo chicken dip as an app and it tastes just like homemade party dip, not that knock off junk you find some places. I had the Dublin burger and wife had the Jameson glazed burger. Both burgers were cooked perfectly medium and tasted great. Presentation was nice and everything was clean. Will definitely be back again. I love the jamming, loud, sports bar/party type music setting, but if you're are looking for a quiet dinner to chat I'd probably find a different spot on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Always great food. Crab leg special on Tuesday is the bomb. Been coming here ever since we moved to medina two years ago and the food so exceeds any \"bar food\". Love the specials around St. Pattys day. Great specials and huge menu, our go to. My husband is in their beer club and Brandon behind the bar is so very knowledgeable and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We've been here many times and are even members of their beer club. Today though they couldn't find our beer club paperwork. They spent 15 mins looking for it. No luck. This place must be under different management or just too many new workers. Took forever for an order of 6 wings. Then another 15+ minutes to get our sandwiches. Medium burger was well done. Waitress forgot to bring beer order. After dropping it off we never saw her again. Waited over 20 minutes for our check. Worst experience there ever. Won't be back. Too much turnover."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere and great place to watch a game. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Expensive. Food was good tho. Drinks were good but no real specials or cheaper shots. Staff was a little short but got what we needed I guess."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visit this place regularly since it's re opening. The service is always friendly and prompt. Their draft selection is excellent and their ruben rolls are to die for. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get some good food and drinks."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday, that's the appetizer specials night. The food was great, the service was excellent, our waitress was Alex. The owner came by, James and shook our  hands he was very polite and nice to us. 
We purchased 3 drinks and five appetizers for $33.61,  not a bad deal. 
The location is at Shurmer and Pearl, where the old Johnny Malloys was."}
{"text":"Quick staff and great food! Had the cucumber & tomato sandwich... Very good! Karina was our server and she was very kind and a great waitress! Will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you look at all the not recommended reviews. They like to delete all bad reviews for this place"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast & brunch spot on the weekends.  I've tried many of the items on the brunch menu and all were terrific.  My husband likes Johnny's breakfast which is just a typical breakfast of eggs, meat, toast and potatoes.  It is overpriced but all the other things are reasonable.  The avocado toast is a knock-out but I always have to scrap some cream cheese off because it's too thick.  Also the chicken and waffle sliders are amazing and the brunch mac and cheese delicious!!! I hope to try the cocktails soon, maybe on the next bender!"}
{"text":"Guys Night Out and we hit Johnny's before bowling and the food was pretty good!!!!
Well it's just bar food but again...Keep it simple and do it right and people will keep coming back...Pretty packed but service had no problem with our 10 top and all the food came out quick and warm!!!
Thats huge!!!!
Thanks Johnny J!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch, beer and basketball yesterday. I had heard through the grapevine that the food was pretty good since the location changed from \"Legends\" to \"Johnny J's\". Overall, I was not disappointed. It was definitely a \"pub\" atmosphere, with lots of people sitting around the bar watching the games. The TV monitors were all big and new, so there was plenty of \"screen visibility\" no matter where you were sitting. None of the volume was turned up however (jukebox playing lightly in the background), so I asked Dolly (her voice reminded me of the actress from Airplane movie) if she could turn up the monitor that was right above me - and she happily obliged. There was a $4 Heineken beer special where you got to keep the glass, so that was cool. For food, I decided to try the \"Mac N Chorizo\" pub sandwich. It was macaroni, cheeze, chorizo, etc., on a potato bun. It actually sounded better than it actually tasted, but it was still very good; but the skinny fries that came with it on the side, where awesome. Elsewhere on the menu were some of your typical Irish food fare, reubens, potato cakes, etc., as well as burgers and sandwiches. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend after hearing great reviews. I had previously tried going about a month ago on an Indians playoff game night and it was over an hour wait for a table so I'm glad I could try it on a less crowded night. I am glad to say this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Strongsville.

 I have been to the restaurant that was in this space previously and this one is much better. They gutted the place and completely redid it. I love the decor- very hip and trendy. There are a ton of tables (all different style of tables too) and a huge bar. They also have these really cute lights made out of Jameson bottles (trendy). 

The menu was impressive as well. The biggest selections were appetizers and sandwiches. They also had some flatbreads, salads and main dishes. Drink and beer selections were very impressive. HUGE draft list (probably 20 or so on tap) and an even bigger bottle list. 

I ordered the tomato soup and the grilled chicken salad. The soup was just alright, didn't come out hot just kinda warm and it tasted very tomato saucy. The salad was great, just the right size. The other people in my group ordered the O'Malley flatbread and a cheeseburger with tater tots. Everyone loved their meals. 

I have heard that Wednesday nights are ladies nights with $3 beer, wine and martinis. I need to check that out soon. This is a great spot and I will definently be back!"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Medina. Can't beat the huge big screen projection on the back patio."}
{"text":"I can't speak about the food because frankly after knowing what happens at night I wouldn't want to eat here. If you want to practice your UFC fighting skills come here where you'll meet up with Strongsville's \"finest\" W 6th rejects. This is not a relaxing come grab a drink kind of bar. Bring your own pen because apparently bartenders just give your receipt with no pen."}
{"text":"I generally don't review bars unless there's something really fantastic about them and I never review any place to just talk about the service. But honestly, the service was THAT bad to the point that it should be talked about. 

I came here with two friends on a Friday night for some drinks. The place was decently full, not too packed but with a healthy amount of people. It took a while for a server to ask for our order and even longer for a drink and food menu to be brought. I was a bit baffled to find that the drink menu didn't have any prices listed anywhere and the server was unhelpful and ballparked the prices.

When we placed our order, the server was adamant about getting a credit card to open up a tab for us despite our insistence that we were planning on paying in cash. She then proceeded to tell us how she had people run off on their tab last week and how she really didn't want it to happen again and asked us to be honest and pay before we left. On one hand I understand that that sort of thing is a problem (obviously - completely rude and honestly vile behavior) on the other hand I'm not sure it was appropriate to tell us that and then proceed to treat us as though we were planning on doing the same thing the entire time we were there. 

It took a while to get two of our drinks. It took even longer to get our third drink which was a plain Coke. The place emptied out as we waited for straws for our drinks. When she brought them over, the server banged the unwrapped straws against the rather sticky table and placed them in our drinks and walked off in an agitated manner. By that point we honestly just wanted to finish our drinks and leave which honestly, didn't take that long. The drinks were 75% ice. I get that it was a mixed drink for a bit over $6 but I still expected a bit better.

I'm hoping this experience was a one-off but between the completely lackluster drinks and honestly horrible and downright rude service I'm not planning on coming back."}
{"text":"It's like they put a west 6th bar in the ville bartenders are amazing and the atmosphere is unbeatable. Guaranteed to find a girl to take home every time you go there during the weekend"}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews. Didn't think it lived up to the four stars. 

The waitress was nice but the food was just mediocre. 

Some people said it was a family friendly place and I did see children there but it is very much a bar atmosphere  - just so others know 

Not sure if we will be back -- maybe for a Browns game!!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar and it is very fun for a night out. The bar tenders are nice but also hard to get a drink. I could be waiting for 10 minutes until a bartender to notice me. On the weekends they have a dj that comes in. And they turn off the lights and have colorful lights. If you are looking for a bar to hang out with your friends and dance this is a good bar."}
{"text":"I went to Johnny J's for the first time on a Thursday. After arriving we were quickly seated by the friendly hostess. We opted to sit at the bar so that we could get faster drink service. The restaurant is huge! It's great for a big party or night on the town. The menu has a lot of options and it was hard for us to decide. After much contemplation I decided to get a salad and my bf got a steak. The food came out pretty quickly but there was hair in my salad. I didn't want to complain or have them make me more food so I just had the bar tender take the meal. I'd visit Johnny J's for drinks but not for food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this evening for a bite to eat with my parents. Pleasantly surprised by the large, diverse food menu as well as the solid tap list. 
Our sever was polite and attentive. 

The only complaint I have is that the music was far too loud for 6:30pm on a Monday evening. It was hard to hear one another and overbearing."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing, service was excellent, LOVED everything. I wish I could of taken this bar home to California with me!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area and found this on the map so figured I would check it out. Not only did the huge menu draw me in, but once you go inside, it just keeps going - very huge bar and restaurant with a large patio in front.

I was torn on what to get so had to ease in with a Moscow Mule - fresh and delicious! Finally made my choices and the waitress was very helpful and provided me with great service. 

Will definitely make a stop here again!"}
{"text":"Love it here! The food is good and the atmosphere is awesome. The waitress Amanda with the long hair and glasses really made things worse though. She was very rude and aggressively slammed menus and silverware on the table when I told her we had a few more friends coming and made me feel like a burden. She really made me feel unwelcome and was incredibly rude to me and other tables around me. She truly made my experience substantially less enjoyable and I will not return while she is working to avoid this happening again. Other than her horrible manners and extreme lack of respect, it was a good time!"}
{"text":"I like what they've done with the place! I usually get wings or the Jameson burger.  Great place to watch a game!  Crowd starts getting younger quick as 9-10pm, especially on weekends"}
{"text":"Service: 
4 stars. The bartenders actually made sure you had a beverage & the wait wasn't too bad. 

Food: 
Motz sticks - 2.5 stars (skinny and long with not a lot of cheese) lame

Ruben Bites - 4 stars - pretty tasty 

Waffle fries 5 stars - get the cheese sauce on the side. 


Over all 3.5 stars out of 5. Not a bad neighborhood bar. Clean bathrooms. Nice patio."}
{"text":"It's about time Strongsville got a decent sports bar. The inside is huge and is amazingly decorated. 

Food is great, bartenders are friendly and prices are very reasonable. Much better than the new Brew Garden by the mall."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been here multiple times, maybe 15. The past 3 times we went in sat down and were ignored for at least 5 mins, so we walked out, this happened 3 times!!!! I really like this place and the food is good but the waitress's are snotty young girls who seem like you are bothering them by placing an order. They could use more seating as well, I'm sad we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far the nicest bar in Strongsville! From the decor, to the food, to the service I haven't found any other bars/pubs in the area that even came close to my experience at Johnny J's. I love the big open patio and the overall atmosphere. It's a great place to eat and watch a game and still has an awesome late night crowd (DJ/dance floor), which I have not been able to find previously. I drove past it a lot and was waiting for it to open and I can honestly say it surpassed my expectations. I will definitely be back for another fun night with my friends!"}
{"text":"I have to say my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by our visit. We went just to check out the new pub in town. I have to to tell you the service was excellent! The staff was all over the pace and we never had to wait for beer, food, or have our table cleaned up. The food was good and very reasonable priced. The place was pretty crowded and everyone around us seemed to be having fun. I have visited the beer garden twice in Stongsville and have to say.......Jimmy's blows that place out of the water! I think The beer garden staff needs to do their training at Jimmy's because it's not even close on Service! We can't wait to go back for another date night! Keep up the great work and we wish you nothing but success."}
{"text":"Not bad food , little greasy , but definitely on time. I like playing pool , it's a good experience around people and clientele so protecting."}
{"text":"Johnny J's is nicely remodeled and it has a very good pub atmosphere.  Servers are friendly and the Managers are accessible and make the rounds to check on customer satisfaction.  Sat at the bar....ordered a draft with wings and a burger.  Never got the wings and the burger was just OK.  The beef was seasoned with something that I was not familiar with.  When it became time to settle up, I received another customer's tab, which the bartender quickly corrected. ( I was not charged for the wings, however) This one bad day will not keep me from returning because overall, I think it's a good new bar in our area.  I'll just stay away from the burgers and try something else next time."}
{"text":"My sister had her hubby's 40th here last night.  Server was awesome. Owner and Manager were awesome. Food was great. Very accommodating crew.  Very attentive and cared. Never been here before but will be back! Great place!"}
{"text":"I know this is one of few spots for a late night beer in Medina, and their prices are right...but just so you know ITS NOT WORTH IT.  For the following reasons:

1.) It smells like sewage, sat down at the bar, quite far from the bathrooms and had to move to the far side of the establishment because it smelled like straight up porta potty.

2.) The service is pretty often terrible, and I'm not sure the bartenders are of age (this is subjective of course, but someone should ID those girls)

3.) We came in on a weeknight, when it was pretty empty and put $5 in the jukebox to play some groovin' tunes (Lettuce, Hiatus Kaiyote).  Soon, we noticed they were being skipped about 10 seconds in and kindly asked the bartender what was up.  She responded, \"Oh, I'm sorry...I thought that was on our radio, there wasn't any words...it sounded like elevator music so I skipped it\" .  Another patron backed our music selection stated \"I liked it, it's pretty funky\".  We didn't get to hear our music, or get our money back.  Rude.

4.) If you went to Medina High School and prefer not to run into your classmates who might still live in town or visit for the holidays, avoid this place. 

I have a strong appreciation for dive bars, but usually its because they have great service and a fun atmosphere, this place is just sad."}
{"text":"I've visited here several times in the past couple months.  Lunch and dinner.  This wasn't just a 'let's put a fresh coat of paint on the walls and open' job.  When they took over the Johnny Malloys spot they completely redid it.  Inside and out.  Irish decor abounds and its really cool.  Daily specials are amazing and I notice the parking lot is packed every night.

I've had pretty much every appetizer on the menu thanks to half off appetizer night.  Chips are homemade and are crispy and delicious.  Chicken tenders were breaded and were very tender and delicious.  Wings are large and very good as well.  Hot sauce reminds me of a typical Buffalo sauce and will be the one get when I order wings here.  

I really like this place.  Only issue I have is no kids menu.  When we visited with family who had small children it wasn't a huge issue.  But it would have been nice."}
{"text":"Next time you think of eating here bring a bottle of spice and eat half of it, with a shaker of salt and save your money. Also they charge extra for onions, and you will get two slivers on your whole meal. You will get more food for your money somewhere else with faster service."}
{"text":"Johnny J's is a great place to catch up with friends, watch a game, or play some trivia while enjoying a beer and snacking on some bar grub without running a huge tab. I've been here several times and keep coming back.

Johnny J's has ample seating, including high tops and several really long bench booths which are great for groups. In all of my visits, the service has ranged from average to very good...I've never had bad service. The food is standard pub fare with an Irish twist. Some of their signature offerings include Reuben rolls, a Dead Irishman sandwich, and the Jameson Burger which happens to be one of my favorite indulgences. It features corned beef, cheese, cabbage, and a tasty whiskey glaze. Their wings are pretty decent, too, and they offer a variety of sauces and rubs.

Right now they're running their 2016 World of Beer Tour which features 110 beers (some on draught, some bottled, some canned). There are three different prize levels: one for trying 30 beers, one for 60, and one for all 110. The prizes range from t-shirts to growlers to a Beer Tour Party invitation. It's a fun way to try some new brews, though I do with they had more options on draught. Still, Johnny J's is one of Medina's better options if you're looking for a casual place to grab a bite and a beer."}
