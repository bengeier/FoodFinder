{"text":"Just paid $10 for the most pathetic joke of a steak sandwich that i've ever eaten my entire 31yrs of existent.. dry & burnt rolled up steak on a dry bun with a tiny little sprinkle of cheese, no sauce, no peppers, no onions, no side and no drink for $10?!?!!! Should've gotten a footlong from Subway and upgraded to a combo for $7.50 instead, at least my sandwich would've been edible and came with a drink and a bag of chips, WHAT A JOKE.. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC"}
{"text":"No frills choice for Italian food in the area.   Layout is straightforward, solid metal chairs and tables,  stainless steel order counter at the back with a hot table. The menu can change daily (check the ink board), but you'll find the basics from sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, and salads.   This is a retail part to their catering they do. Most customers are the lunch crowd in the surrounding industrial area.   Food is authentic and house made. I've had gnocchi, penne, chicken cutlet on past visits. Portions are ample."}
{"text":"Had the Veal sandwich with everything and it was OK.  Not great but not bad either.  Location is very busy at lunch but moving fast."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian pizza, better to order ahead of time, can be kind of slow in there."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Its near-ish my office.  I ordered a veal sandwich.  They have large-ish portions.  I went with 6 other people.  Seating for larger groups is tough, but they were accommodating and did push some tables together so we could all dine together.  My sandwich was a bit cold, but maybe because we got there at the end of the lunch hour.  The gnocchi did look delicious, I will try that next time!"}
