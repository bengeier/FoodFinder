{"text":"Big and Juicy fried Oyster..... and the Ipswich Clams also a must try for true clam lovers.
I usually take the food to go ......."}
{"text":"I thought the Canadians were the only ones who knew how to do great fish & chips, and have looked for years to find something even close here in Phoenix.  I stumbled onto Taylor's through a friend, and let me tell ya, it was great.  As good as, if not better than, the Canadians do, complete with malt vinegar on every table."}
{"text":"Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \"home\", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service."}
{"text":"Horrible is being nice.  Being from CT I was excited to find the article in Phoenix magazine about the whole belly clams.  They were bitter, strong and tasted old.  They were also soggy and seemed under cooked.  My wife ordered the special which was stuffed flounder with some sort of sauce.  It looked and tasted like it came from a box.  Again tasting strong and very fishy, obviously not fresh and home made.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Long John Silvers would be better."}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Boston and driving around feeling hungry in Quincy, Mass and stopped into the Clam Box. I got hooked on fried clams while stationed in Winthrop while in the Army. I see a place advertising fried clams I gotta stop. I overheard the couple at the counter mention Arizona, well we started talking to them and it seems they moved to Glendale for a job but they come back evey year to the Clam Box. They take back frozen clams from the Box when they go back to Az. But they told me that a rest in Az also serves whole bellies. Taylors! Its now my favorite place to come and have Ipswich Clams. That happened about 16 years ago and Taylors is still the best place for New England seafood."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly and willing to adjust to meet your requests.  Food is very good.  Small loaf of heated bread is a plus.  A daily lunch and dinner board displays the specials.   They usually have Walleye Pike that is worth a trip.  I would give this restaurant four plus stars."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites.  The fish and chips are AMAZING!!  The batter is light and flavorful.  The lemonade is freshly squeezed.  The prices are good.  The waitresses are friendly.  The ambiance is laid back and a little cheesy but I like it.  If you can't power through a lot of food order the one piece fish and chips."}
{"text":"I went to Taylor's Chowder House this past Friday. It is the best seafood I've had since leaving home - nothing is ever as good a mom's cooking. You will not find better Seafood in the Phoenix area than at Taylor's - guaranteed.  The service was also superior.  Red Lobster or Taylors?  Taylor's every time.

 PS - I don't say this stuff unless it is well deserved."}
{"text":"Battered fish is better than Long John Silvers. 
Rice was boring. Portions were small for the price. 
Clam chowder was salty, good luck actually finding a clam amongst the potatoes.
Waitress had a hard time listening & responding to customer in an appropriate manner. 
I will keep looking for a place that has its food cooked & presented in an appetizing manner. Will not return to this place."}
{"text":"Very bland seafood.  The chowder was watery and bland with only two pieces of clam in the broth.  The calamari was tender but tasteless. I believe they are serving octopus and not squid.  The oysters were served on ice and good.  The baked potato was yesterdays, very dry and reheated plus, I had to cut the black part out on the end of the potato!  I've given this place one star because the pike was the star.  Fresh, lightly breaded and a nice portion.  However, this was also very bland. It needed lot of lemon. The so called garlic butter for the bread was no prize.  The place remains dingy.  Its been 15 years since we returned and it looked the same.  One wonders what the kitchen looks like!  Once again there was one server for the entire place and two people in the kitchen.  I came down with an throat infection the following day.  Makes you wonder.  Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"O.K.  I made a visit albeit still skeptical.  I absolutely must point out first and foremost that anyone who views this as a good destination for anything related to New England OR Seafood is one of three things.

1. Owners of the restaurant
2. never had good seafood before
3. never had good seafood before

The clam chowder is a pasty concoction that does not begin with bacon/salt pork, has bits of chewy rubbery clams, is tasteless, and overall would recieve a boost with the addition of a couple of cans of Snow's.

The fried clams were horrible.  The only plus was that they were not strips.  They were actually \"Bellied\" clams but I use that term VERY loosely.  Price will always determine the quality when it comes to clams.  they cost a certain amount of money and there is no way to get around that.(unless of course youre not using Ipswich Clams)  There is no way that these are from Ipswich Shellfish Co.  The batter is terrible as well.  Why would anyone choose to fry a clam in anything but an evaporated milk/corn flour dredge??

Any new englander who has had a good chowder from legal, Sole, etc. or a clam from the clam box, essex, or Ronnies knows that this place is not your fried clam destination.

Wait!  i almost forgot.  the tarter sauce was horrible as well.  Can i give zero stars??"}
{"text":"My husband says sometimes you just need \"fried\". Good New England-style, fried seafood is not easy to find in Arizona. Taylor's absoulely satisfies that craving. They have whole clams even! The fried combo plate is excellent. And the grilled Talapia was cooked perfectly.

The atmosphere reminds us of some of those charming little family-owned seafood joints back east. Prices are very reasonable and the service friendly and efficient.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been going to Taylor's for many years for one simple reason, great Seafood at a reasonable price. Yep the place has the same decor for those many years, but it is a genuine local neighborhood restaurant and does not pretend to be any else. 

Enjoy the management and staff, genuine and friendly people. Nice to meet and talk with people, and just keep up with them on how how life is treating them (what makes Taylor's great, like coming to I dinner at family's house). 

I love the Chowder, especially XMAS chowder, and we are big fans of Walleye, Trout, Halibut (when available), and Salmon. Fish is always fresh and perfectly prepared. I have brought friends here from San Fran, East Coast and Sydney, and they all walk always having thoroughly enjoyed their meal. 

The crowd is mainly local, and that adds to the charm! Just real people coming for good food. This is no Salt Cellar, but that is what I like about it.  If looking for good food, reasonable price, and nice people, seek out Taylor's like we have for couple of decades now."}
{"text":"I would have never even thought of going to this place if my neighbor didn't take me here. It is a hidden gem! 

The clam chowder was awesome! Only disappointment was that I got the cup vs the bowl. I wanted more! 

I also got the fried oyster po'boy. I'm not a fan of raw oysters, but have a \"must try everything once\" mentality. And I will certainly try it again! 

I have already recommended this place to people."}
{"text":"Their fish and chips are delicious and I love the feel of the restaurant inside. It feels small town and friendly. I want to try other dishes but always end up with the fish and chips! Their fried cheese is unique and delicious too."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time after hearing good reviews about the New England style Clam Chowder. My husband is from RI and he ordered the Manhattan style chower, I ordered the New England style and we shared a seafood plate. The soups were only average and the seafood plate, all of which came battered and deep fried, were soggy : (  We will keep looking for good seafood."}
{"text":"When we pulled into parking lot I was concerned about eating here.  The food was wonderful!  Best clam chowder I've had!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My family loves eating at Taylor's. On occasion the service can be a little slow, but the food is always worth waiting for. It's a small business with a small staff and they do the best they can. The servers are always super nice and the food is fresh and hot. I'm giving this restaurant five stars because for over 20 years everything I've ever ordered has been great (except maybe the corn, but that's not what I'm there for). If you go there bring a sweater, they keep this place very cool."}
{"text":"I like seafood, my hubby checked online , they all say here is a good place to go. Yes, they have so much seafood for one meal, you can eat it very full. But I more like to eat no fire seafood. Here almost every seafood all fired."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? We ordered the seafood stuffed fish and there was NO seafood in the Mrs Cubson's mushy stuffing at all! I looked for the crab, there was none. Not to mention the $15 dinner price doesn't even include salad, really?!?! They have not spent any money on decor or the quality of food for sure, so not sure why they think they can charge more than a chain for tasteless mushy food ."}
{"text":"+The service was really bad bad bad
Rude!!!!
Food had no flavor!!!!! but ok just needs salt or something.
have been there a few times, thinking It would be Better and every time have had, bad service, Will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff and excellent food. True hidden gem! I Love mom and pop shops.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with everything Chad F said.  The chowder was way too thick and tasted pasty and the clams in it were more rubbery than reasonable.  The only waitress in the place was vapid,she couldn't give directions to find the place over the phone despite being 40 something and having worked there for many years and inattentive, we had to wait for plates to be cleared despite being one of two table in the place with patrons at them.  The clams were tender but the tartar sauce was HORRIBLE.  I wanted to try the bellied clams, I love steamed mussels and clams as well as raw oysters but ended up pulling the very soft muddy tasting bellies off.  That can be discounted as a preference thing but bad tartar sauce is inexcusable as was that clam chowder.  I am a phoenix native but just because I am not from the east coast doesn't mean I don't know what good clam chowder, fried clams and tartar sauce should taste like and this was not it.  Honestly I think I would have been way better off with chowder from a can and fried clams from Long John Silvers and they serve chum.

The food seemed reasonable but my husband and I ended up paying around $45.00, I had chowder and a clam lunch, he had a shrimp lunch with a bad iceburg salad.  The food was overpriced for the quality and terrible.  Save yourself a trip, don't go here.  Phoenix is huge and there are many other establishments that deserve what they charge, this place does not."}
{"text":"Arrived hungry with reuniting with chowder from my past! My father in law and hubby ate here on lunch times when their offices were near by. Fresh Asphalt met us and they were not apparently open!!! So sad! Phone # message did not indicate Taylor's would be closed! Am here for only a few days soooo sad."}
{"text":"Tom: I used to live in Nantucket and the seafood in New England is second to none.  So for those people who are saying \"it's not great seafood, not like it is back home, etc.\" I say what do you expect?  You're in Phoenix. I had the baked seafood sampler.  The scallops were just right and not too tender.  The cod was great and really zesty.  The shrimp I was disappointed with and that was one thing that you should be able to nail out here.  They made a Red Manhattan Chowder for specials which was a surprise and I really enjoyed it.  This is even tough to find back east.  Prices among everything else really stood out.  You just don't find seafood for that good of a deal out here.  I have two more complaints. One was that the beer selection was pretty weak but I enjoy Sam Adams B-Lager but I can also get that anywhere.  The other problem was that the men's problem was filthy and needed to be not only cleaned but re-modeled in general.  It was in the kind of shape where regardless of if you cleaned it or not it would still look pretty trashy.

Ann: I am not a huge fan of seafood, but am trying to expand my horizons.  I found that the food here was mediocre.  I had a special that was Cajun Pacific snapper, was not quite \"cajun\" and a little \"fishy\".  However I tried Tom's baked cod and scallops which I truly enjoyed.  The atmosphere and service could be updated, as the wait staff seemed to only take interest in the regulars.  Overall decent seafood for the price in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There was a group of 12 which I had called in the day before. I had never veen there before this visit. They were ready for us, extremely patient, very friendly, & our server, Sharon, was the best! She kept our drinks full, & was very attentive.  The food exceeded my expectations,  & we will be going back! Thank you for making our first visits so pleasant!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a place to get my oyster fix. After yelping seafood restaurants I picked Taylor's for my next trip to Phoenix. I ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell to eat in. For take-out I ordered the fried sampler platter, fried clams and poor boy.  I was not impressed with the oysters, the oysters laid directly on the plate with small ice cubes on top, I've only been eating raw oysters for a couple years, but this is the first time I've seen them prepared this way, normally they  set on a bed of crushed ice. They taste like buffet oysters that are shucked and frozen on the east coast and  then shipped out to the wholesalers. Don't get me wrong, they didn't  taste bad, I look for that kiss of the sea flavor. it wasn't there. Now  everything else was very tasty.  The batter was seasoned very well and everything fried perfectly. I give the take-out  4 stars."}
{"text":"for being on the west side it a good place to come look like your bad in the 80s a little ran down and the parking lot is a little scary but the food is decent I had the grilled cod and scalps cook well for seafood price was on the cheaper side now the service was  average but what to you expect from a place like this it wasn't bad just very slow it's really a 3 star but for being on the west side  the price   and being around forever it worth the the extra star"}
{"text":"I remember going there several times as a child and as an adult my previous experience was not good (did not write a review) The same group who was there the first trip agreed to give it another chance.  We went for lunch, the location and dated decor instead of knocking it I am going to say it brought me back to my childhood I still remember the nets and giant swordfish (stuffed on the wall not on the menu FYI) It was an afternoon and although not overly busy ( 6 tables or so) the nice female server acted as hostess/server/busboy/cashier for the entire restaurant.  When I say cashier they still write the orders on green ticket books and I could see her adding people's checks with a calculator! She forgot one or two things quickly corrected but she was nice and efficient in my book for running the entire front of house I have to give her credit! Everyone had the clam chowder which was our biggest complaint the first time, this time sooo good! Creamy with large pieces of clams and potatoes.  The lunch menu seemed smaller than I remember they did have daily specials, all of us had the platter a fried cornucopia of shrimp, scallops and fish with two sides we all had the waffle fries and cup of clam chowder for 1.25 more well worth it.  One person at the table got potato wedges which she said looked better than they tasted bland and tasteless.  One large piece of fried cod relatively tasteless batter and only one large fried shrimp (disappointed shrimp is my favorite) I don't care for their tarter sauce besides creamy texture has little taste.  Everyone at the table raved about the fried scallops you get (3) large scallops not the tiny bay scallops (they were very good but I have decided I love scallops just not fried) some things if they were cooked perfectly (which they were) is a travesty to deep fry.  The waffle fries tasted slightly old as looked the lemon wedge on the plate.  Will be back again definitely will order the clam chowder and next time probably the fried shrimp or crab cakes."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this is the best seafood place I've been to in Phoenix. I went here after a food critic, that I follow, highly recommended the place. I haven't had any great fried clams outside of a coastal-city, until I came here. Their clam chowder is also amazing (obviously lol). Nothing against Pappadeuxs (another place that has great seafood), I would pick Chowder House over them any day."}
{"text":"They probably have good fried food but anything else is just not good. Campbell's clam chowder is better!"}
{"text":"Great seafood. I use to work there in the mid 90s. Recently went back to eat, and I was not disappointed. I got the chowder, fried cod, and bread pudding. Yum."}
{"text":"We are back to this restaurant and it does not disappoint. It is consistently yummy.
We ordered a cup of New England clam chowder each and shared the friend seafood platter. I am from from the East coast and the New England clam chowder is the best outside of New England. 
I highly recommend this restaurant if you want good seafood."}
{"text":"I've eaten seafood all over the valley.  I drive over from Scottsdale a couple of times to eat here.  Consistency is a huge thing with me and the food at Taylor's never disappoints.  Truly the best fish n chips in town.  Don the owner is the king.  All staff is nice.  Go on Wednesday for all you can eat fish n chips.  The best clam chowder this side of the Mississippi.  Hard to find about 1/2 a block north of Thunderbird off of 35th ave in a mostly vacant strip mall.  They've been there since 1985 so they must be doing something right...Love it...."}
{"text":"As someone who used to live nr Boston I was delighted, 12-7-16, to have whole-belly Ipswich fried clams here. Medium sized, quite good! Unfortunately I was very surprised that the cup of chowder (\"chah-dah\") - which of course is right there is their name, was poor at best, made from 100% cheap stuff. Chowder details:

First No taste, what \"clams\" there were were tiny and tasteless (likely out of the can). And instead of being creamy New England chahdah it was gelatinous(!), I suppose from all the flour &/or starch in it. I would guess the $3.75 cup cost 20 cents to make. Suggestion: If u must stay cheap, at least add some (inexpensive) clam juice for flavor(!). Definitely avoid it, or return it if u r so daring as to try it.

Would have gone 4 stars (seldom rate 5) if I didn't have the chowder. But will be back to try other entrees and hopefully enjoy them. Glad Phx has such a place & I wish the owners Great success! Sincerely, Geo."}
{"text":"It's next door to the American Legion hall. That must be where most of their customers come  from. Everything just lacked flavor. Heck, I'd even take some salt. 

I wasn't expecting spicy or seasoned, as that's a whole 'nother cuisine. I just wanted some kind of flavor. 

And if I can't get flavor, I'll at least take some texture. But no. Instead of a fluffy, crispy batter on the fish, it was tough and a bit chewy. The breading on the clams was a little better, but still flavorless. 

The only bright points were the steak fries and cole slaw, both made well. But how hard is it to screw those up?"}
{"text":"Great New England Seafood!!! 
Little neck whole belly clams, haddock and sea scallops!  All breaded or baked perfectly. 
Don't know of anyplace else in the valley to get all three of these items... People who give this place a bad review or want \"more spices\" have never been to New England and eaten seafood....this is like a quintessential New England restaurant.  The decor is exact!  Nicole was very friendly and helpful with letting us know of things not on the menu. 
We really enjoy coming here and getting to enjoy a \"taste of HOME!\"  
Even the bathrooms are just like the old fish houses back home!  Crazy!"}
{"text":"Local Seafood house in Glendale. The Clam Chowder is very good."}
{"text":"The best fish & chips in the universe!!!!!   Small place,  Sooooo good!  It's a little pricey but they give 3 huge pieces of fish with 2 side's and bread.  I loved it and will go here every time I'm in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Several years ago I was a regular at Taylor's Chowder House, then moved away. I remember the food being quite good which was why we kept coming back. 

I had the extreme pleasure to drop by for lunch 2 days before Christmas. I was greeted with the odor of cigarette smoke, likely from the American Legion. Don't those folks know that smoking can be hazardous to your health? Anyway, Taylor's offered their annual  Holiday Chowder. This is one of the most rich and delectable chowders I have ever consumed. It consisted of their regular New England with just a few extras, cod, salmon, brandy, shrimp, and most anything else you can think of.  There just is no way to top this chowder, other than with crackers. 

It is a bit pricey. But it is the food you are buying and that is worth it."}
{"text":"The Chowder House has been a westside staple for years, and there is a reason why.....AWESOME seafood!! I have been here several times, and will be going back many more. Huge portions, and some of the freshest seafood in PHX (as fresh as you can get for being inland). My wife and I always order oysters on the halfshell to start. They are some of the best in PHX. Nothing like San Fran etc, but again, great for being inland. The fried catfish is one of my favorite things on the menu. HUGE fillets. The sides are very good too. Waffle fries, slaw, both of which are well above average. I am somewhat of a chowder nut, and I LOVE the chowder here.

The service is always average. The waitresses are always knowledgeable, and the service is fast, but there's never huge smiles. . It's only ok for kids. This is more of an adult date night restraunt .

For seafood fans, I HIGHLY reccomend Taylor's. The best seafood in PHX behind Salt Cellar and Papadeux's."}
{"text":"Somebody on Facebook mentioned Taylor's as a good place for seafood on the West side, so I checked out the Yelp reviews.  I think I had realistic expectations going in, sort of a blue hair place, nothing fancy but good bang for the buck.
I ordered a cup of New England clam chowder (it's a chowder house, right?) and the grilled Mahi.  The chowder was okay, a good amount of clams, but it had an odd flavor to me...cheap sherry maybe?  It's basically just potato and clam and I personally like some bacon, celery, etc.
The Mahi was definitely strange, I expect a 'grilled' piece of fish to be simply cooked over some sort of open flame.  It arrived scored on top with no visible grill marks.  It also had a sort of teriyaki sauce on top that, frankly, ruined the fish-it was hideous."}
{"text":"A little over 20 years ago we found this little gem, I was so pleased with the food and never forgot the sweet potato pecan pie. Flash forward to May 19, 2017. We decided to try it out again, since we now moved closer to the neighborhood. Walked in, stood around for a few minutes, a ha! We were finally seated! The place has not changed it's decor in all these years. I ordered a dozen oyster on the half, they were fabulous. My husband had the fried fish and blue shrimp. I had the Seafood Alfredo. Not bad, but very, very bland. My worst critique was the service is very slow.  We found ourselves waiting and waiting and waiting, crickets.... Very annoying. The best part of the meal was the oysters, how can you go bad on something you didn't prepare? My two stars, are for not having two kinds of cocktail liquor we asked for, bad tasting water, bland food and very bad service. Will I go again? No, sorry, very disappointed with my experience. When I eat out, I expect to enjoy myself."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Taylor's Chowder House lastnight for the first time  and it will be the last time too.

The service was absolutely horrible!  We were seated right away, but it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come and get our drink orders, then another 10 minutes for her to bring them back to our table.  

She then took our food order and we waited again a very long time, people came in after us and were served before us.  We ate our food which was ok and asked for our bill from the manager or owner not sure what her role was at the restaurant, she replied  that the waitress was working on the bill.

We finally got our bill about 10 minutes after asking for it, but the waitress was no where to be found,  so we left the money on the table and left.  We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Taylor's for more than 25 years. I'm from the east coast originally, and love seafood. This is probably one of my favorite places. The fried oysters are fantastic as is the cod. Wednesday night is all you can eat fried cod and worth every penny! The batter is light and the fish is never greasy or heavy! 
While the decor is dated, the service is always with a smile and the food is worth coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"For my 34th birthday, I remembered this hole in the wall chowder house my gramma took me to like 20 years ago. I remember the food being good and the restaurant being cool so I decide to have him take me there. We get there and it is not at all like a remember. It smells like cigarettes with a side of fish and the decor is straight out of the 80's. Anyway the yelp reviews score this place a 4.5 so I thought let's give it a shot. We are already here. So we sit down and our no joke 70 plus year old waitress passes the one drink / specials menu around from table to table. We finally get our turn and order our appetizer and drinks. Then she comes to take our dinner order. My husband who hates fish, orders the steak and I order my seafood. About 20 min later the waitress comes up and tells My husband \"so the 1 steak we have doesn't look so good so the chef won't cook it\". I am dying laughing cause they only had 1 steak and my husband is speechless. He ends up ordering a burger (that wasn't even on the menu) and we eat and life is good. We finish and ask for our check and she comes up and says dessert is on the house tonight. I kid you not, she hands us 2 pieces of sixlets candy and walked away! The food was good except the burger upset husbands stomach. Side note: it was my birthday and I talked my husband into coming here despite his fish hatred."}
{"text":"As a New Englander I found a taste of home ! Very good food and quality New England style service with the accent from Massachusetts !! Good ambience for a seafood joint. Clean and cozy AUTHENTIC restaurant. Well done."}
{"text":"The hubby and I were on our way to get a burger and he spotted this place, so we decided to try it out (after reading the great reviews on yelp). We are glad we did. We were just talking seconds before about how we missed the seafood in Boston. Hubby is from there and is VERY particular about the seafood he eats. 

Taylor's is tucked away in a little strip mall. You walk in and it has a cute decor and feels homey. Except for it was freezing cold to me, husband says I get cold easily but to let yelpers know to bring a sweater just in case. 

Service is friendly. Fresh baked bread is light and airy and perfect comfort food. It comes with a nice herb butter that compliments it nicely, even though it definitely doesn't need it. My husband ordered the seafood Alfredo ($17.95), when it came out it was very underwhelming. Sauce was watery and the portion was very small...think soup bowl. He did end up asking for a different meal. It came out quickly which was great. He went with the fried scallops and whole belly clam meal ($19.95). He says important thing to mention is the batter being different for clams-the way it's supposed to be. I ordered the combo platter which came with tasty cod (2 nice size pieces), shrimp was just ok (2 pcs), and perfect scallops (3 good size). Meals come with 2 sides we both chose steak fries, he had veggies, I had the slaw (which was pretty good). Clam chowder is just ok but was served with oyster crackers! 

Bathroom was cute and clean and made me feel like I was actually at the beach. Smells like the crisp air you take in when wave watching!"}
{"text":"Excellent food good service very large portion for what you pay for you better go in hungry I will definitely become a regular customers  I will say its a hidden gem"}
{"text":"I grew up on the coast in New England so I know my chowder and seafood.  Taylor's is a fun place to go for that New England seafood house experience in the Phoenix area.

I always order a bowl of chowder which is just okay.  Creamy with plenty of clams and potatoes but has a strange flavor ingredient that I can't quite place which makes it taste just a bit off.  A small dollop of butter stirred in makes it taste more authentic.

This is one of very few places in the area where you can get fried scallops that come out tasting how they should and remind me of being back in Massachusetts.  Very large and fresh with a light batter and fried golden brown - delicious.

I know this place has been around forever and it shows.  It really reflects a bit negatively when the decor in the restaurant is fun and authentic, but covered in dust and cobwebs.  The owner really just needs to shut down for a week and pull everything out and re-do it with the same theme but updated.  It would really really improve the experience!

My other reason besides the chowder and decor that garnered only 3 stars is the fact that they won't take AMEX cards.  I know many smaller places don't but it is really a pain when you are traveling and cannot use a corporate card to pay for meals and need to use either a personal card or cash to pay.

If the owners of Taylor's read this review and fix these things I guarantee they would begin getting 5 star ratings across the board!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today to try out the Chowder and fish fry. Didn't take photos but the food was quite good and we will come back to try some of the other food items. 
The place is somewhat small and hidden off the main road but it was worth the time finding it.
Our server Jessica did a great job taking care of us even though she was the only server. I would imagine they have additional servers in the evening.
The men's room could use some fixing up otherwise all was good."}
{"text":"I'm from back east and enjoy great seafood.  Taylor's Chowder House flies in their seafood, and their Oysters are from Ipswich, Massachusetts.  Quite a surprise here in the valley.

I had Creamy Clam Chowder, Manhattan Clam Chowder, Baked Oysters and a piece of Cod.  Everything was great, I highly recommend Taylor's Chowder House to anyone who appreciates great seafood.

The service was excellent and knowledgeable, as I asked many questions about the menu.  Our waitress Nicole, was great.  We will be back.  

P.S.  I brought my daughter and she had homemade mozzarella sticks, which were huge and yummy."}
{"text":"We used to enjoy Taylor's and their daily specials. I even hosted an office holiday party there.  It appeared that there were plenty of empty tables when we arrived on Saturday around 6:30 PM. However we were told that there would be a 10 minute wait. Just before we arrived and while we were waiting, numerous patrons were leaving. Despite many already set but empty tables, attention was directed towards clearing the dirty tables rather than seating people at the many available clean tables. I don't think those were being held because of reservations. I understand that sometimes there is a shortage of wait staff, but it would have been better service to at least seat us with menus. The place was almost a third empty. We felt ignored and it seemed that they weren't interested in our business. The couple that arrived immediately before us gave up and left, as we did shortly thereafter. Even if there is good food, lousy customer service results in lost business. I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"We walk in to this restaurant and while from the outside it looks a tad \"run down\" but the inside is very warm and cozy and sets the stage for a great seafood meal. When you walk in they have a cute table made out of an old lobster crate and the walls have photos that have a New England feel to them. 

The worst part of the meal was being seated.  About half the restaurant had empty seats and a sign that said please wait to be seated and wait we did... in fact three employees walked by us without so much as a hello or we will be right with you. We waited over 5 minutes before we were greeted and seated (yes I am a poet and didn't know it). When we were seated the \"hostess\" had the personality of a rock, she must really not like her job, not a smile or greeting out of her. 

I would say they are \"child\" friendly but bring your own entertainment. We had our 3 year old son with us and while they did have a kids menu (with a pretty painted fish on the back) that was laminated, there were no crayons (the typical kid package) to color with. Luckily I had a couple of crayons in the car which my husband went out to get and we had enough to keep him occupied until the food came.

Here is what we ordered:
Crab stuffed shrimp- which was out of this world, I loved them and might be the best I have had.
Clam Chowder-My husband is kind of a clam chowder snob and he thought this was pretty good. Not the best he has ever had but he said it was good. I am not a fan of clam chowder but I thought it was good and I liked the big chucks of clam in it.
Steamed Clams- My husband and son \"shared\" these. My husband said they were good, again not the \"best\" he has had but still good.
Shrimp and Chips -This was what my son ordered but ended up eating more of my husband's clam chowder and steamed clams. So, my husband had one, I had one and our son had the third. The \"chips\" were waffle fries which was pretty cool and the coleslaw it came with my husband really liked.

We would go back to this restaurant again, and if you are in the mood for some good seafood in the area, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"After a 20 minute drive each way to Taylor's chowder House, I find them closed tonight at 8:15 PM. Their website says 9 PM. Not happy.  It was a planned outing that we all looked forward to.

Long drive to find their hours are only suggestions.  Ya gotta run a place better than that..."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday for lunch and the dining area was not to busy. Their was on server who managed all the tables. Since she was the only server the drink order took about 5 minuets after we arrived. My rating is based off of food quality. I ordered the Large New England Clam Chowder for 4.95, not badly priced, however I have had better canned chowder. very salty and WAY to much butter. Also the temperature for the soup was warm not hot, which probably means it was microwaved/ re-heated. We also ordered cheese sticks and calamari. They did look good when they cam out however, both dishes were under cooked and had to be sent back. Who wants soft calamari and cheese sticks? After the food was brought back to our table, the items still were not crsipy, whatever. the flavor of the breading on the calamari and cheese sticks was so bland and the marinara sauce was sub-par. Unfortunately i would not go back the Chowder house, rather go to Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is a jem in the desert. Excellent old fashion service. Amazing sea food.  A great find."}
{"text":"It has the best fish and chips we have found since moving to Phoenix 15 years ago. The breading is light and crispy and not at all greasy. The waitresses have all been helpful and get the food out as soon as it's cooked. We also have had the peel and eat shrimp and it has always been very good The cole slaw is good,also"}
{"text":"The waitress/hostess was horrible. Had an attitude and seemed very uncaring about her position.  The food was good,however, it is not worth the attitude' though. Will go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Tyler's since I found out they serve fried belly clams.  I was not disappointed, these were delicious!  I also had their fried oysters, both were wonderful and fresh!  It reminded me of the clam/lobster shacks that we stopped in in New England. Nothing fancy but good food.  Service was fine and there were no open tables when we got there at 6 PM on a Friday.  Seated within 10 minutes of arriving.  Would definately go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Haven't been in a while, but since I had a birthday yesterday, we'll be going soon. The clams are my fav and my hubs loves the cod. It's a throwback to my early years living in the south, the decor reminds me of seafood places back then."}
{"text":"I have not visited this little gem in years.  The food was excellent and Nicole was the best!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, definite mom and pop type of feel. The service is great and friendly. The clam chowder and Christmas clam chowder are the bomb, especially because you can put them in a bread bowl."}
{"text":"Well we were super excited to get some fresh seafood as that's all they do. All the seafood is obviously frozen, chewy and with little flavor. The server was about to drop a hot dish of way over priced seafood Alfredo knockoff and it almost spilt all over my niece. The Alfredo has not Alfredo in it and was probably a jar of off the shelf Alfredo's sauce not fresh at all. The steak fries were grainy and overall the $70 only half got ate. The atmosphere is cute and like a beach cabin. Honestly the only thing I think they do well is the fried food. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. I was really in the mood for seafood and I really wanted to like this place a lot from the get-go.

But as you can see, it only received three stars and here's why:

+The service was really good.
+The clam chowder was great. At least its living up to its name!
+The fish and chips that I sampled were really good!
-The prices were ridiculous. For the all-you-can-eat fish and chips it was $11.95... I can go to Fox and Hound for the same quality all you can eat F & C and only pay $7 or $8.
-The baked walleye that I ordered was OK. It could have been more flavorful, the rice pilaf was sweet tasting (like bergamot?) and the tartar sauce is kinda like mayo... it was different and sweet tasting. But I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"Went there and had chowder and fish and chips... the chowder was better than any chowder I've ever had and the fish and chips were amazing! You could tell that the fish was fresh! Would totally return back!"}
{"text":"The first time that I went there, I was born and bred in Boston, the clams were bitter. When I went back, maybe a month later, I told the waitress, a brunette that's some sort of manager or has just been there a long time, about the bitterness..she didn't seem to care. The clams were slightly less bitter..somewhat more palatable, but, I know where they're coming from and it has nothing to do with serving great whole fried clams."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some clam chowder and saw this place on yelp so decided to give it a try. Had a cup and it was okay. A bit salty for me taste.  Also had the oysters on a half shell, they were fresh and very good.  Overall okay place, may decide to checkout other dishes some other time."}
{"text":"Awesome... I just had the home made cheese sticks, accompanied with the Stone Porter Beer, followed by the Baked Alaskan Halibut Oscar... Not only am I a pig tonight, but a very happy man."}
{"text":"Phoenix has very few decent seafood restaurants and years ago, we found Taylor's Chowder House.  The place was packed with seniors and families at almost any time we landed there.  The owner was from Rochester and Boston and knew seafood as well as anyone.  The New England Clam Chowder was made from scratch, full of clams with potatoes in a sea of white sauce. The Best in Phoenix for years.  They also had specials every day based on what came in fresh that day, whether Tilapia, Mahi-mahi, halibut and haddock or fresh Maine lobsters all prepared well at great value.                                                                                                         Yesterday, we went back to Taylor's and what a difference.  The old owner turned the restaurant to his cook who sold it and took it back.  When the current owner was a cook, he prepared the food meticulously; nothing fancy but very good meals made from scratch.  This visit that night was so different.  I am on a restricted diet, so I often share a meal with my wife.  We had a hankerin' for fried haddock and recalled the long, fresh filets coated in batter and fried to a golden brown.  The meal came with waffle fries and cole slaw. So, we ordered the fried haddock dinner split with a bowl of their hearty New England Clam Chowda.  The waitress brought a loaf of bread that looked like it had been served over and over.  Needless to say, it just sat there. Next, she brought our drinks, a glass of decent house Pinot Grigio and an Arnold Palmer.  The lemonade mixed in with the ice tea had a metallic taste and was horrid.  The waitress did notice it sitting there and offered to replace it but likely no different from the first,  Next, she brought the bowl of the famed chowder that gave the restaurant it's name and reputation.  What I remembered was nothing like that.  It was awful.  The broth was too thick with a flour taste, few clams and heavily over salted; what a disappointment to start.  A few minutes later the waitress brought us the two plates that she had split the meal already so each of us had a smallish piece of haddock, some steak fries and dish of cole slaw.  It looked inviting, to be honest until we tasted the haddock.  Replacing the large fresh piece of haddock were two smaller pieces of frozen haddock.  We had hoped for a light flaky fish and what we got was clumps of fish meat in fried batter that was too long in the freezer, possibly not even haddock.  I had a small portion of the haddock but it was so awful, I could not eat any more. I thought I would try the slaw instead but again, not up to standards.  The dressing was very bland that no amount of salt and pepper could improve upon it,  The steak fries, however, were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside.  The fries were the only thing I ate.  This was such a disappointment that it is a shame of how far off our original visit it had come.   The highlights were the wine and steak fries,, plus the friendly sociable waitress.  We noticed how small the dining crowd was on a Friday night and most were very elderly. I felt we were in God's waiting room.
This is another case of a cook with little restaurant management experience, in my humble opinion trying to make it work.  When the customers dropped off, he decided to lower his costs and cut corners.  Not much changed inside in 20 years except for the food.  We probably will never come back because of the disappointment of this experience."}
{"text":"Why don't good restaurants stay good?  Why do the seem to disappoint once you've raved about them?  Loved Taylors the first two trips.  And tonight, the fried clams were soft and soggy (you could taste the flour or whatever they were dipped in) and clams are supposrd to be crisp.  My wife, who is from the coast of Massachusetts and introduced me to belly clams could not eat here.  So we sent them back and guess what....they came back fried just the same.  Sorry Taylors....I really thougnt we'd found a new seafood favorite!"}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the so-so reviews. Yes, Taylor's isn't going to be setting any trends for culinary adventure, but they serve up good fried fish & shellfish at a reasonable price.  The chowder and the raw clams & oysters are decent as well.

The decor is 80's kitschy, New England seafood restaurant and the staff is very nice. Small bar with beer, wine and liquor (yet they always seem out of Sam Adams) 

If you come here for one thing, and one thing only, it's the Ipswich Fried Clams.  It's nearly impossible to find this in the Phoenix area, and if you do, it's usually overpriced and not prepared very authentically. The Fried Clams here are fantastic, a good sized portion and cooked perfectly, just as you'd get at a clam shack in Maine!"}
{"text":"Slow service, spoiled fish, dirty bathrooms. NEVER AGAIN. Had been wanting to go here for years and was very disappointed. Hard to find."}
{"text":"Taylor's Chowder House was established in the early 80's. Since then it has been a very popular spot for many relocated Bostonian's and other Easterners. A Southie ex-bf explained that a Chowder-head is a dolt or a stupid person and that you would have to be a big Chowder-head not to fall head over heals for Taylor's.

They are open for lunch and dinner in a very comfortable (albeit a little cheesy) environment for super great prices.

All meals start with hot fresh bread from Villa Deli with herbed garlic butter. This stuff Is so amazing that you could rub it all over your body!

As you can probably guess, Taylor's is known for their chowder. They make a good Manhattan (tomato based) chowder, but the New England style is what makes my mouth water. It's thick, creamy and stuffed with potatoes, onion and clams. This is the real thing!

They have the only selection of fresh shell fish that I know of in the Phoenix area. Clams, mussels, oysters, whatever your preference... they have something for you. The shrimps at Taylor's are from Guyamas, on the Sea of Cortez in Mexico. They are big, flavorful, and fresh.

Taylor's offers a large selection of daily specials in addition to their large standard menu. Specials are seasonal, based on what's fresh, but I have NEVER been disappointed. There are weekly specials as well - Smelt Mondays, Kids eat Free Tuesdays and Wednesdays are All You Can Eat Fish and Chips. On Sundays you can do brunch and the Build Your Own Frittata.

Most entrees can be prepared to your liking - broiled, blackened, or fried. There are also fried only options for calamari, Alaskan cod, shrimp, oysters or clams (fresh Ipswich belly clams - these are the really meaty ones). The batter on these is crisp and light - it is absolutely excellent and doesn't drip with oil. All entrees are served with your choice of sides, but I would highly recommend the cole slaw (it's great).

The have a handful of desserts to choose from, but honestly I have never had enough room to even try one so I can't comment on those.  : )

If you are looking for coastal freshness and quality, you may be a bit diappointed, but if you are looking for good seafood in this desert, try out Taylor's - I'm pretty sure you will be impressed.

p.s.  if you are a yankees fan, leave the your blues at home... this place is redsox all the way! : )"}
{"text":"Was expecting much more from this place. The service was ok, they were busy took awhile to even get drinks. However they were very nice. The food was very bland and for the price of the seafood platter it was a big disappointment. Glad we tried it, but will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot for fried oysters and fried Ipswich clams. Nothing fancy to the decor and I am ok with that. I like the quality and taste for a fair price."}
{"text":"So to start. I'm really having a hard time giving this place 3 stars. The food. It was good. That's the reason why. I'm not a seafood eater but I do like a good cup of New England clam chowder.  It was pretty good! I ordered the steak. It was tough and kind of chewy.  My family ordered fried cod and shrimp. They said it was really tasty! It was enough food for leftovers for everyone. The coleslaw was meh. I've had better. Nothing to write home about.  
Now here's the downfall.  It was enough of a downfall that I am considering not coming back. The service sucked! It was so slow. Our waitress was nice but was more focused on the elderly customers then us. And there were a lot of elderly customers.  Most of them were her regular customers so she was extremely focused on them.  It took 15 to 20 minutes to get our check and pay. That was just unheard of."}
{"text":"Food was very good and you can tell it is fresh made. Had a special Halibut Oscar and the sauce was great also had the chowder that was mouth watering. Quick service and very friendly. The crowd could be younger but you will not have any problem getting a table."}
{"text":"Went in to have the clam chowder and it didn't disappoint. Good fast service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We go to Taylor's quite often and have always been satisfied with the fish dinners, shrimp dinners and the crab cakes. We haven't tried anything else. I personally ask to be seated in Cathy's section because she has always been friendly and gives us fast service. We definitely will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Not good eats. Old, dusty, very tired decor. Food was so so. Needs Chef Ramsey or Restaurant Impossible....or something.  Even the lettuce was droopy. Time to pick this mess up and take it into 2012."}
{"text":"I will say that their fish and chips are just the best... 3 huge pieces, with choice if sides for 13.95 and on Wed it's all you can eat for that price. The fresh battered fish are huge!!!! The decor is a little old, and it's kinda of lost in its location. But so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Just got done having dinner with my wife.  This place brought back memories of growing up on Cape Cod.  We had clam chowder and fried clams.  It was delicious.  The waitress was pleasant and helpful.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"We went for the first time for dinner and heard good things about it.   First, it took a long time to get service.  I wanted to order the chowder in a bread bowl.  That was not available for dinner only lunch.  I wish I had known before I ordered the bowl.  It was not very good.

The drinks took a very long time to get as well.  We order the fish and waffle fries (chips).  they soggy and not very tasty.  We had to wait a long time for more tarter sauce.  It was not what we were excepting.  We will not return.  There are more options at better prices.  They were more than I wanted to pay for what we received."}
{"text":"The decor is dated and tired.  We had their special, talapia, but it didn't taste very good.  We don't think it was cooked through.  The service was slow. There are several fish restaurants in the valley that are much better than this one."}
{"text":"The New England Clam Chowder was quite good.  Very rich, small bowl for the money (I think it's priced at $3,95).  But it's the signature dish, I \"get it\".

The Ipswich Clam roll was mediocre.  What I really didn't care for was the $3 side of cole slaw that could not have been 2 ounces.

So, my meal was $21 without a tip.  Trust me when I tell you I ain't going back for a $21 meal of soft clams, good soup, expensive cole slaw.  I'm sure there are fans of this place, just not me"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place for seafood and I came across Taylor's Chowder House. I worked in the restaurant business for many years, from a dishwasher to General management. From 24 hour to fine dining. I have to say other than the service which was average this was probably one of the worst meals my family and I have ever had. We ordered the catfish, the seafood sampler and a steak. The seafood had no flavor and I could swear they cooked the steak in the microwave. The baked potatoes were old and over cooked and the dish of corn looked kind of green. The server noticed I couldn't eat the steak and asked if I wanted to try something else, but given the other meals I passed. She did have that one meal removed from the bill. Can't say I will be recommending this place anytime soon. Just terrible. And we were celebrating a birthday."}
{"text":"We've been visiting Taylor's 1 or 2 times a month for the past 7 years or so.  Never been disappointed with the food or wait staff.  I usually order the baked salmon (very good) with rice pilaf & coleslaw.  My partner usually gets the baked cod dish & has never had a complaint.  Good value for the buck!!  By-the-way you can get a coupon online for a cup of free very good clam chowder."}
{"text":"Ah this is a plaice  proving that  punliness is next to codliness.  Good now that the we hate pun people are gone I can  let you in on a quiet , and tasty, secret.  

Yet another of those restaurants that don't show up on conventional searches, has nothing in the way of street presence yet consistently knock out great food.   Why not a  five?    Excellent question.   Tonight was surprisingly quiet around  1915  it was more Marie Celeste than Love Boat  which is  on most occasions nice but  for those that like some life  may find it unsettling.  Let's get into the food.  The chowder ( both NY and Maine) on offer was  pretty good but did hit a couple of  flour spots in it, the olive oil? on top superflous and Pappa Deuxs is still in the lead  within this five mile radius  of Metro Center.  The appetizer choice is lack lustre,  e.g  3 kinds of shellfish and cheesesticks. The latter are massive and  most sane people won't finish all six alone.   

Onto the main course.  The mahi mahi , marinitated  for 24 hours, was perfect and flavorful. The sides that come with it are pretty limiting. Fries, coleslaw, baked potato, rice  or veg ( pick 2 ) and  that fish atop a nice bed of rice with an accompanying salsa would be amazing.  Fish is so good it's  making the rest  seem average in comparison.    The fish and chips  which my partner had were massive , tasted average, batter has little to no flavor but the textures nice.  It's hard to get a taste from the cod without moving it.   Wow that still gets a four?  We've eaten here prior and the service is always good, the  food is always at least good   it's just that   I'd love to have the same experience with the appetizers and sides that I do with the star(fish)  of the dinner.     The bread at the start, the garlic  butter with it is  wonderful, really  wonderful. In relation to  what I had  when I lived by Monterey,CA,  I would give this a 3.5   rounded to four."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions and our waitress's Nicole was great! We will be back next time we are in town, glad we found this gem on Yelp!!:):)"}
{"text":"Best fried class outside of Boston.  Full clams with bellies.  Cooked just right.  A little on the small size but a generous portion.  Nice steak fries and cole slaw come with it.  The cole slaw was OK but nothing special.  The waitresses were fabulous - very friendly and genuinely happy I chose this place.  Made me feel right at home.  The New England Chowder was better than average though again nothing special.  An excellent menu of all things New England.  You can't help but find something terrific to order.  It's hidden away in an obscure strip mall so be sure you know where you're going or you'll have trouble finding it."}
{"text":"Came in with gf and her son. Liked the set up and had a good vibe. Service was great. We ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer and the shrimp were big and fresh. Had the calamari and salmon. Both were fresh and delicious. Would def go back again."}
{"text":"I went here once a decade ago and thought it was decent. I recently went back, and wasn't too impressed. I was disappointed with the New England style chowder here. Just a small amount of clams, not much flavor, mostly salt. The combination fried seafood platter was better. Particularly the scallops were good. The fish was ok, but the batter was a little thick. They were out of the dessert I wanted. The service was slow. It looks a bit run down inside. Overall, I doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"I went for all you can eat Fish & Chips Wednesday's and I can honestly say it was the best I have had in Phoenix..I will be back :)"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I was unsure at first when I walked in but after eating the food all donuts are gone I wished they where more visible to help with customer traffic   The food super my whole party was very happy with our meal and the waitress was great her boss needs to give her a raise.  Will return"}
{"text":"I must say I did not fully experience this restaurant, So I am only reviewing by the quality of their clam chowder and the little bit of service i received while I was in the establishment. 
The chowder was so-so. It is the best I have found in the immediate area so it might be worth going to if you're nearby and have a craving. However for the portion you get it in pretty expensive. I have had better chowder at a lower price. 
The service was old school, no non-sense, I kind of liked it. The atmosphere is pretty dumpy and kind of creepy. I wouldn't recommend women walk across the parking lot alone. In fact I might pack heat if I ever visit again, some of the biker dudes next door were looking at me like they liked me."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems I've found in Phoenix! I love the nautical/fish/beach decor in this restaurant that gives you a warm, homey feeling of being back at the Jersey Shore where I spent my childhood summers.  Also the best fried cod fish I've had in the2 years I've been in AZ! Definitely a must-do again!"}
{"text":"A cozy place with a Eastern Seaboard ambience. I am a big fan of clam chowder and a even bigger fan of Manhattan clam chowder. I highly recommend it, it was delicious. I have been craving oysters so I ordered a dozen, next time I'm ordering 3 dozen. I had the seafood combo fried, shrimp scallops and cod, I'm so full. It was a huge portion and fresh fish. Overall an excellent dinning experience thanks to our spunky red head waitress Maryanne aka Ginger. Ask to sit in her station. Sorry no pics by the time I thought about it the food was gone."}
{"text":"Very average, and I was expecting a lot more from a place that has been around for as long as they claim.
Here's the long and short of it.  For the price, you cannot expect it to be the greatest seafood you've ever eaten.  However, it would have been nice if the seafood would have been the star of the meal.  It was not.
The portions are large, although it is mostly breading and grease.  VERY cheap ingredients show through in every dish.  You can tell they are cutting corners every place they can.  Frozen (maybe even canned) fish, not real butter, frozen veggies, even the bread seemed to be day old or perhaps even frozen. 
If you are not picky about the food you put in your mouth and are only looking for an alternative to a McDonalds fish sandwich, then this is your place."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times. The food is always good. But if you like to lounge around for at least two hours this is the restaurant for you. Especially if you don't mind poor service. Tonight's meal was good but the service was absolutely horrendous! The waitress seem so angry. Not at us but at the world ! All we ordered was two entrées but it took at least 40 minutes to get it. She never checked in to see if we like the meal and when we finished she gave us a check and said have a good night. It's too bad but I'll only go to this restaurant far and few between or less. If not for the cook this place wouldn't have a leg to stand on."}
{"text":"Coming from the Northeast, I have really missed a good seafood dinner and now I can get it here since we just found this place. The atmosphere, the decor, the people and especially the food, all get an A+ from us. We will definitely be back even if it is an hour drive. Sure is worth it. Come on by and have an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Loved the chowder and the baked fish was good too - Server was a little perturbed when I asked for a take home box (right when she just gave one to another member of our party) also, my husband got several refills of his soda, but when I asked for one refill of my drink, it never came!"}
{"text":"The breading on the cod is way too thick. It reminded me of a corn dog. Chowder was ok, probably comes from a can though. We don't plan on returning"}
{"text":"Food has been good each time we have gone. However the service has been very sketchy for lack of a better word. 
T"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The third time that we came in the manager Gillian called my daughter and my dad by name. She remembered our orders and takes very good care of us. We feel like family when we are there. The food is amazing and the staff is so pleasant! These people go above and beyond to make you feel at home. And did I mention the food is amazing!?"}
{"text":"I love NE clam chowder, live in Prescott Valley. I was down in the Valley and some old friends asked me to meet them here. First as other people have said, the exterior looks like a dump but the interior is very nice. Our server was super nice and really knew the menu. I ordered the clam chowder NE they also have red. It was great. I also had the best cheese sticks I've had. I watched as fried fish orders came out of the kitchen. Everything looked wonderful and large portions. I can't wait to go back and try a po-boy and fish and chips"}
{"text":"BY FAR OUR FAVORITE SEAFOOD DIVE in Phoenix when we need seafood the is not overprice like Red Lobster and Joe's Rob you blind shop.(See my Review after my birthday)

The Staff has not changed much in the 15 years I have been going there"}
{"text":"The outside doesn't look great but the inside brings back memories of New England. We tried the Cod both fried and baked.  All I can say is it was great. My partner and I both enjoyed the dinner. This was a very nice surprise."}
{"text":"The service is soooo slow and they don't take American Express. The table next to us was complaining about them not taking American Express too. You have to wait way too long for your food & then you can't even pay with the credit card you want use. No reason to go back, very disappointing."}
{"text":"We went here this past Sunday, Nov. 1st, 2015. 22 customers and one waitress? Then it grew to 32 customers and one waitress. We ordered chowder and fried cod, with Fries and coleslaw.  The chowder wasn't very tasteful It very bland. The fish was good & hot. The fries were luke warm. The coleslaw was ok. The place has been around since 1985. It needs a make over, more help and other tenants in this lonely empty plaza. It's too bad, because the idea of fresh New England fish in an area of 1.5 million potential customers is a good idea. It just has to have good management."}
{"text":"This one is hidden, and must get its business by word of mouth.  Taylor's Chowder House has fresh fish and their Alaskan Cod is great.  Also love their New England Clam Chowder.  Prices very reasonable and a great alternative for someone looking for an alternative to Red Lobster or other chain sea food restaurants."}
{"text":"Just came back from a trip to Seattle and the fried clam bellies at Taylor's are so much better than clam strips we got right on the Puget Sound. We can't wait to return to Taylors to get good clams because the clams at famous Ivars in Seattle were terrible. Taylor's clam bellies are superb. Right here in the desert. Who knew?"}
{"text":"Oh my where to begin... First, when we arrived we were quickly sat. We noticed the place had quite a few other patrons, but  wasn't close to packed. Any who, a busser came to take our drink order, 3 iced tea's. 

After about 10 minutes, we began to wonder if she had forgot about our drinks. Meanwhile, the lady that was our server kept buzzing by saying, \"I'll be right with you\". 

We noticed the hostess had sat another table in our servers section, which our server promptly greeted and began taking their drink order and going over their specials. Mind you this is 20 minutes after we had been sat, and still had not received our drinks nor spoke with our server. 

After another 5 minutes, the table next to us, that had came in 20 minutes after us gets their drinks. By this time, I am upset and got up to find our missing drink order. I notice our server is sitting near the front door, shooting the breeze with another server. I went back to my table, gathered my family and left. 

Upon noticing we were leaving, we could clearly hear our server say, \"welp, just lost another table\". I couldn't believe what I was hearing... They clearly do not value their customers

So needless to say, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST. 

I ended up taking my family across the street to Abacus and tipped $20. Your loss Chowderhouse. F-"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get all you can eat fish fry. A very casual place with great service and good food. I will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Went to have a great relaxing dinner but it did not turn out that way. We got a table pretty quick but that's where it went bad. We waited at least 15 min to have our order taken, including drinks. It was another 10 to get the drinks. We waited about 30 plus minutes for our dinner, that part was great. One of our party asked, who we thought was a waitress to get him a glass of water and she said she'd be right back. Didn't happen. After waiting another 5 minutes he ended up getting a pitcher of water himself but no cup. Our waitress had been out of sight after she served our food. I finally found the gal who said she'd be right back  and asked her for cup, she said she would let our waitress know and I said to her \" When? In 10 minutes?\" She snorted at me. Turns out she was the manager. The guy in our party finally got a cup from our waitress and then we asked for the checks. He hands her his debit card and when she bring the slip for him to sign it, he realized she charged him $100.00 too much. What a  fiasco. The excuse given was that Thursday night aren't usually that busy. No excuse for poor service and bad attitude. I will say that our waitress, absent as she was, was still very polite to us."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful.  The food was excellent and the waitress was very helpful with our selection.  We got the shrimp cocktail and both ordered the cod dinner plate.  The shrimp was perfectly prepared and the dinners were light and tasty."}
{"text":"We love this place!  My husband threw my surprise 50th birthday party there.  We went here for my husband's birthday just the other night.  First off, it's tucked back oddly from the street in a strip mall.  The décor is decidedly nautical in theme with buoys and lobster traps on the wall.  The staff is always so friendly and helpful and even though we showed up a little late they were more clthan accommodating to our group that included a high chair for our granddaughter.   The wait staff had fun with our granddaughter.  Here is what I love most about the restaurant is that they have Ipswich clams - belly clams.  My folks were from New Hampshire so this always takes me back to summers spent back East.  The clams are fresh and fried to perfection.  The fish is terrific.  A trip to Taylor's always makes for a really fun meal."}
{"text":"Food is very good portions are very large
Service is very friendly. Lots of staff it seems but only one waitress that works all the tables??  Service is slooooow"}
{"text":"If you like good/great fish do not go here. If you want average AZ type of fish, an, \"All You Can Eat\" Fish Fry for 12 bucks, and you are not a picky person who knows good food than by all means go here. It is what it is. Kick it to three stars if you have a big appetite and want to eat a lot. lol---

We had dinner here tonight and it was just average. My friend suggested it since she heard raves but then could not figure out why. We had a coupon for a free Clam Chowder. I do not like that so did not get any. My friend said it was not good at all. We both got the fish fry. All we can say is, \"Meh.\" 

If you are a big eater then it is probably a good deal. They do give you a lot of food though. The service bothered me. Our server was very nice but she got basic things wrong. I am usually very forgiving of that but it added to our non impressed status of the place. A Diet Coke turned into an Ice Tea and she figured the bill wrong. Also, the bathroom was filfthy. A big,\" No, No\" for me."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. This place is horrid. I did have a good meal here - back in '85. When I was 4. When I thought tacky, dusty lighthouse decor was hip. I went back to Taylor's on that single memory and *surprise* they have not changed the decor since then. And I am pretty sure judging by the taste that they have not changed their inventory of seafood since then either. Yes, the food was SO bad that I DO NOT think they have changed the seafood inventory out of their freezer since 1985. You (and your wallet) are better off hitting up the Long John Silver's. You read that right - BETTER OFF AT LONG JOHN SILVER's."}
