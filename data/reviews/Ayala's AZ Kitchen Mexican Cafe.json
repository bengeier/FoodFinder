{"text":"This was my first time here, and I so wanted it to be good. But not such luck. The service was OK,, there were two girls tag teaming and I felt rushed for my order.  We started with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa really seemed liked it was a pre packed item that was \"spruced\" up with some fresh cilantro and green onion. It was just OK.  Wealso ordered the guacamole, I had to send it back because the avocados had gone rancid and I could not stomach it. I told the waitress this and she tried telling me it was because the cook added too much lemon juice and she would ask him to make fresh without the lemon juice.  When the second batch came out  it could have been very possible that the cook just added salt and garlic and maybe some other seasonings to the original batch as it still had that underlying rancid avocado taste. I was never asked again if it was satisfactory even though it sat on the table. My main dish was two tacos, one shredded beef and one chicken, they were the only things I could stomach as the rice was flavorless and dry and the beans were dry and tasted like \"spruced\" up canned beans. The best part of the meal was the kids meal made of chicken strips and french fries. I am sad to say that I will not try this establishment again."}
{"text":"We figured we would try some new Mexican food places around here and see if there was anything we were missing. So far, not missing a thing. Unfortunately the food tasted store bought and right out of the can or jar. We also went on a weekend night around dinner time and at most there were 3 tables eating. So it felt like everyone else already knew this wasn't the place to be. On the bright side, the servers were very polite, but that doesn't make up for the lack of quality products. We each had chicken and I also tried the shredded and ground beef. All meats just didn't taste fresh and we will not be eating here again. Time to try the next place!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant flan I've ever had! The green chili burrito was great too. Will be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My son and I eat here regularly. Never a bad experience. I usually ask for a suggestion to try something different. Never disappointed. Chimi's are great, so are the loaded nachos. Great staff. Try it,you'll like it too!"}
{"text":"Big thanks to Steve and his crew!!!! For making my daughters graduation lunch super special and super easy for us!!!!! He had us set up for 20 although we ended up with 23 EVERYONE LOVED the food especially the QUESO !!!!!!! They allowed us to bring in our own cake and they just took REALLY good care of us and our party while we were there!! The FOOD was excellent, the SERVICE above parr and we never felt rushed to leave!!!! This is a new business here in Peoria that definately needs to be supported!!! Thank you again STEVE!!!! You guys are awsome!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what Bonnie expected after she wrote, \"not much content.\"  We eat here about twice a month and they don't skimp.  As you can see from my previous review, there are enough for me to eat at least 2 meals. I am over 6' tall and I don't eat light a bird either.  We had the Mexican pizza for the second time now.  Whoa, it has two tortillas with toppings piled about 2\" high. I love that it has a whole olive on each slice, and a bunch of guacamole. My husband and I shared for a meal dinning in and took half home to share for another meal at home.  THAT IS 4 portions.  It comes with 8 slices, so it could easily be an appetizer for 8 people."}
{"text":"Awesome food and proportions.  Great service!  For under $10 you get a Baja chicken chimichanga meal with rice and beans.  The chimichanga is as big as the plate.  You can taste that the beans and rice are homemade.  Try the churros with vanilla ice Cream and a caramel sauce that is out of this world.   Can't say enough good about this place."}
{"text":"Its alright..   Had the red Chile chimichanga and that was great.  The sopapillas for desert and they were terrible. Soggy, no honey, thumbs down on the powdered sugar, I don't know what they were thinking. Its like they just put it together quickly. The place was empty and it was a Saturday afternoon. So there it is."}
{"text":"This place was really clean, spacious and inviting.  HUGE portions of AMAZING food, and yet somehow I didn't go home with leftovers... definitely recommend the chicken enchiladas and the churros with ice cream and carmel for des"}
{"text":"Very very good Albondigas Soup! Yum...FYI, we almost drove by, it only says AZ Kitchen Mexican cafe, we were looking for Ayala's but it's not on the sign."}
{"text":"I just finished my entree and am trying to think of anything negative to say but I've got nuthin'!    The food was fantastic, the service was good and the value was excellent for the amount food. I couldn't finish my plate and that's rare! The last six bites were taken simply because the food was so good and still in front of me. I was nowhere near hungry at that point.   I will be back and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I sometimes get stuck on ordering one or two things I know I love... Today at AZ Kitchen I decided to try something new: Baja Chimichanga. OMG it was excellent! The chicken was packed in and the flavor was wonderful! Cheap lunch prices, perfect chips and salsa and excellent hometown service.  So looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"It was 2pm and the owner was on his computer in the dining room (uhh they make offices for that stuff), but this was Peoria and the town is not exactly brimming with good food options and I was on a lunch time crush. The town has alot of those annoying, \"we close at 2pm restaurants\" So, I took a chance and was the only person eating in the place at this time. They only have about seven choices in the lunch special category and once they said that they only use DARK meat chicken, I should have hit the road. These establishments are saving money by not wanting to serve more expensive products. The chips and salsa came out first and the chunky salsa looked like it was ortega with green onions tossed in there, but the darker thin sauce was at least pretty good and the top layer of the chips were crunchy and fresh. The food though went downhill. The sour cream green sauce ground beef enchilada was a disaster, although for some reason I did not mention this to the nice owners when I normally would have a comment. I told him it was \"not bad\" It was not a sour cream sauce, it was a lob of sour cream tossed onto the food and the green sauce was not present or was tasteless. The ground beef fell into a the tasteless category as well, no seasoning or flavor and the tortillas were not helping much either. Nice staff, but not good mexican food."}
{"text":"Very good, traditional Arizona Mexican food. The restaurant is clean and well decorated (Mexico-style colors) with a very nice landscape mural over a couple of walls (I understand it was a well-known graffiti artist). The tables are 4 person tables that could easily be combined. It's in the strip mall adjacent to the Peoria Theater, and has some room to grow. I can easily see it as the destination after a trip to the theater.   The food was very good, with very large portions. I'm a big eater, but was stuffed with a chimichanga (they come enhilada style). My wife had the carne asada torta and really enjoyed. The rice was unique - not typical of the chili flavored spanish rice in most places, but more of a dirty rice with bits of vegetable, etc. It was very good, and a nice change. For dessert we shared a deep fried cheescake. My wife enjoyed it so much she's bringing a daughter back for the cheescake in a few days for her birthday.   The prices are pretty much in the sub-$10 range for entrees, and the portions are large enough you can take some home for tommorrow's lunch.   So, we're adding this one to the few mexican food restaurants that we frequent."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to.The food has no flavor, the red enchilada sauce was brown.The wait staff was horrible . The waitress asked how everything was and when we said horrible she kept walking.  . Save your money."}
{"text":"Was a fan of Ayala's food in the past. New location has the same great food. Big portions, delicious chips and salsa. Fast service too. Will definitely be back. Can't wait for the bar..."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food! Great portions, friendly service. I really liked the Spanish Steak."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. The chips are fried in peanut oil, which leaves a horrible aftertaste. The Machaca chimichanga I had was just shredded beef with canned green chilis added and a quart of sour cream on top. My wife had the baja chicken chimi, it came with a whole brick of very salty cream cheese on top. I feel like I want to throw up just thinking about it. Very disappointed. Next time we'll go across the street to Don Lencho's!"}
{"text":"This is a definite local hole in the wall type place that is ran by a family with authentic Mexican recipes.  The food was good and my guest and I were able to hang out for a couple of hours talking, the staff was very good and supportive of us just hanging out, near the end, we were the last two in the resturnat."}
{"text":"I saw someone said their green sauce looked like gravy, what?  I love the baja chimi. It is a chicken burrito with green sauce and baja sauce.  It is not as spicy as I would like, but I add plenty of their hot  sauce and it is awesome."}
{"text":"Solid service, somewhat greasy with some of the food ordered by our group. I had the Mexican pizza....couldn't stop myself from eating the whole thing.  Overall I'd say it's worth checking out and at least trying."}
{"text":"Would NEVER eat here again. My wife, sister-in-law and I all ate here last night. The service was great, and the food seemed to taste okay... About 6 hours later, all 3 of us were puking our guts out. The only thing that we all had in common was the meat, beans, and rice.  I called in and talked to a manager \"Steve\" the next morning, and he didn't sound concerned at all, the first words out of his mouth were, \"We served that all day long and our health inspections and sanitation practices are excellent.\" Not and \"I'm sorry\" or let me look into this at all. He was more concerned about covering his rear end.   I would avoid this place..."}
{"text":"We have dined at AZ Kitchen twice.  The first time was in early November and I read about it on Yelp.  We were greeted right away and it was super easy to get a table on a Saturday night.  We started off with the queso and chips and they were great.  For dinner we had chicken tacos, kids quesdilla  and  chimichanga's .  For desert we had churros and ice cream which we all enjoyed.    We decided to go back in mid-January as we enjoyed it to much the first time.  Again, we were seated right away and started off with the queso and guacamole.They still did not have the liquor license.  The second time was not as enjoyable as the first experience.  The food was average/bland.  Our server was a little annoying.  She kept coming to our table every two minutes to see if we needed anything.  For a Saturday night it our table and another table were the only customers  in the restaurant.    I do not think we would go back."}
{"text":"Best bean dip. Best Mexican food on the west side as far as we are concerned. The prices were fantastic and the portions were huge. Our service was WONDERFUL! We will be making this one of our go to places."}
{"text":"Good salsa and chips.  I enjoyed my Machaca, but everything else was below average in flavor.   I expected more given the reviews."}
{"text":"YUMMY! My hubby and I tried this place tonight and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. This is not tex-mex, but it's authentic homemade Mexican food. I had the Baja chicken chimi with jalapeño cream cheese. The green sauce over the chimi was so delicious and the chimi was huge and stuffed with so much chicken!! The jalapeño cream cheese was so good with everything else. The salsa tasted great, too. My hubby had the \"pick 3\" meal and got a burrito, tostada and enchilada. He also thought his meal was outstanding. The portions were very huge and the prices were so reasonable. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The wife and I love Mexican food so tonight since our normal place is closed Mondays thought we would try az kitchen.  It was great a family owned place from the start the greeter held the door open for us we sat down and were served with chips and salsa right away both salsas were very good, I ordered a chicken chimichanga and my wife ordered beef tacos both were very good. We're definitely going back and I'd recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Wow we were craving Mexican pizza and they made it \"Amazing\" we will be coming back again and highly recommend, the food is good and prices are fare"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Huge portions and great quality. Not the usual AZ Mexican restaurant. I will definitely be making this a regular stop. Our server Emily is fantastic. She's very attentive and went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect. Next time I'm going to save some room for their delicious looking desserts."}
{"text":"Great fresh tasting mexican food.  I always say you can tell how good the food is going to be by the chips and salsa.  This place has both fresh chips and salsa with a lot of fresh ingredients along with a variety of entrees, just what Peoria needed."}
{"text":"My first time on this restaurant and my last. Me and my wife ordered the machaca burrito enchilada style.  My son ordered a cheese crisp with rice and beans.  Our food made its way to our table pretty quickly as we were the only customers in the restaurant at 10am on Sunday morning.   I cut a piece of my burrito and started chewing. Wasn't that bad but wasn't good either. As I was about to cut another piece I notice a hair in my food.  I notified the server and he apologized assuring me of a new burrito being cooked but I politely declined and said I would rather not eat there. My wife didn't like it either.  He called the manager over and I explained what happened. I told him I would pay for my son's kid's meal since my son was liking it and wanted to take it.   The manager still charged me for my drinks which we didn't even drink. I looked at my wife smh but I didn't wanna argue with th be manager about why I feel he shouldn't have charged me for them.   Never coming here again sir. Might I add, your arms and clothes were dirty like you had been working construction before showing up to work. Not a good look."}
{"text":"We returned to AZ Kitchen Monday afternoon. Only one other table occupied. Service was fast as would be expected. I had the #1 combo which is a cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco and bean tostada. The wife had a green chili burro enchilada style and a shredded beef taco. It was all great. We really love the place. Authentic Sonoran Mexican food that is presented perfectly! Doesn't have the atmosphere, but for a hole in the wall mom and pop place it is perfect! Lots of potential with some wall hangings etc.! A must stop if you are nearby or traveling the loop 101 in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere set in s newly remodeled strip msll. Service on a Friday night was quick and friendly, maybe because I was one of 2 tables with guests at 7 pm. Could it be the food, I had to ask myself as the parking lot was full. Ordered the carne asada torta and my friend ordered a green chili burro deep fried enchilada style. The food arrived surptisinly fast, it almost beat our water drinks. I will start with my torta, the carne was almost cooked to crisp leather and chopped fine to maybe disguise it. The roll was tossted nicely but the rest made it the worst torta I have ever tried to consume. My friend let me taste her burrito which was very good. I gave up on the torta and claimed half of my friend's burro. The green chili and service raised my rating to 3 stars but the torta might explain all the empty seats on this Friday night."}
{"text":"I saw the solid 4 star rating and didn't read much further. Now that I read some of the lower number reviews...I can see it.    We thought that this was a solid \"three-star experience. The food, while tasty, (and looking like huge portion sizes) didn't really have much content (Ie chicken/beef in enchiladas). It was more rice, beans, lettuce etc. The chips however, house-made and fresh, were excellent and they weren't stingy with them and they were complimentary. The salsa was tasty as well!   The interior is interesting w/work done by graffiti artist using only spray cans, interior does have something of a cafeteria feel. The staff is very friendly however and made sure we had what we wanted.  Note: no liquor license yet! & they do serve breakfast as well, beginning at 10am which is my kind of breakfast start time ;)"}
{"text":"This is a nice mom and pop type restaurant. We arrived shortly after opening on a Sunday morning and were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly and offered us suggestions when we asked. We went with a green chili cheese crisp and a chicken chimichanga. Both were very good. I really liked the cheese crisp and that we were asked if we liked it soft or crispy - crispy all the way!  I like the current decor but I think that they could soften some areas by hanging curtains or valances in the doorways or from the ceiling in the back to block the server area. Otherwise everything was very good and I would be happy to try Ayala's again."}
