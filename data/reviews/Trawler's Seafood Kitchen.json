{"text":"Pros
Prompt and friendly staff.
Great Menu Selection
Coleslaw is good

Cons
I had the special (2pc Halibut). It was terrible. Dry and Rubbery.
Far too overpriced for the quality of food ($20)
Sides were unimpressive."}
{"text":"I went to Trawler's for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I had high expectations since a foodie friend of mine swore by it. Unfortunately, we were both disappointed on this visit. We both ordered halibut and chips. This was probably the driest halibut I've had in Calgary. While it didn't taste fishy or anything, it wasn't a pleasant texture either. The chips were ok. The batter was nice and light. However, dry, overcooked halibut isn't high on my list of dining choices. It was probably one of the worst fish & chip experiences I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Just what I want when I eat seafood!
Great fish and chips, good scallops
Nice staff
Fair prices"}
{"text":"Best seafood in the city. Large portions means good value too! Parking at the back."}
{"text":"I love it here and frequent this place. My favourites are the fish & chips and the fish chowder.  If I am wanting a quick cheap meal the chowder is a sure thing. The fish and chips is a splurge, but oh! It hits the spot! Other menu items are great too. It is kind of old fashioned (in the best way!). They are friendly, well priced and unpretentious. I hope they stay open forever and never change. This has to be the best Fish and Chip place in Calgary. This is what casual eating should be."}
{"text":"Trawler's is one of those hidden gems that you come across and wonder if you should tell anyone or just keep it to yourself.  It's connected to Boyd's Lobster Shop which sells fresh and frozen seafood so you know that the quality of the seafood that Trawler's serves is fresh!
The deep fried oysters were a good size with a crisp breading.  Flavorful and juicy...  Just a hit of fresh squeezed lemon and delicious!  
Haddock and chips were a good portion size.  Moist and flavorful on the inside while the batter had a great crunch when I bit into it.  
Their seafood chowder had so many wonderful flavors.  Fish, shrimp, scallops...  And the broth was light and creamy and wonderful.
I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Very good deep fried Southern comfort.

Calamari...4 stars.  Cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The accompanying cocktail sauce is amazingly rich!  Only gripe is that they didn't drain the oil properly....excessive pools on the plate.

Cod...4.5 stars.  Perfectly cooked.  The fish is fried in a light batter that just barely coats the meat yet offers a nice thin crispy exterior, allowing you to taste all the goodness of the fish and not deep fried batter.  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is being under seasoned.  The fish by itself is quite plain but thankfully they have a bottle of tartar sauce handy."}
{"text":"When compared to really good British fish and chips of bygone days this is okay, but at all doesn't generate a high-five.
We've been there a couple times but given so many good restaurants in the city and many more fish & chip places to check out, likely won't return. 
For different prices, you can choose sole, haddock and halibut. Openly adjoining the restaurant is a seafood specialty shop and deli, but one look didn't turn us on (presentation does count!) 
Not sure why the proprietors in such places talk a great story, but what lands on the plate all too often disappoints. Here at Trawler's, you will likely be pleased with the portions and the flavour - as far as it goes - but in the end it is only decent."}
{"text":"If one is going to stuff some deep fried inside one's body, might as well balance it out w/ the better quality of fish:  Alaskan Halibut.  For a connossieur like myself, it does taste the difference between Pollock or cod.

Cripsy batter, fish flakes right off each bite, and good fresh, home-made tartar sauce.

There's also a separate place to buy fresh seafood, which is an independent business.  

Parking's tough, find on side streets."}
