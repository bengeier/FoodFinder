{"text":"we were so exited when we saw the menu , we did order one Chinese one Korean dish but when we got home we got the wrong order and it wasn't even yummy , not sure if we will give a second chance :("}
{"text":"food was decent, but the price for Korean/Chinese food was too high for the amount of food we got. we spent $60 for 2 kids and 2 adults and no one came out satisfied :( really wanted to give 5 stars cuz the service was great, but it was not worth it."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside but the food here is delicious.  We ordered the bulgogi, pork dumplings, chicken wings and short rib.  I enjoyed everything just wish the price wasn't so high.  We spent about $60 & I would expect to send that much at a better looking restaurant with a serving staff, not order than sit.  Although I didn't care for the price, I would go back the service & food was good."}
{"text":"My fave has to be the Black Bean Noodles with Pork and the spicy seafood soup! And then sometimes I get the spicy pork bibimbap! The service is awesome! She's great! Really can tell that's family cooking!"}
{"text":"Pretty spot on Korean food!  Hey if you guys at China wing read this please open up a proper Korean restaurant in Charlotte.  There are almost no Korean options in Charlotte !!  Good value excellent food."}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte often for work and this is my go to place for good Korean. Happy to have found it. An unassuming place with a non-Korean restaurant name but has good Korean options, also delicious. Often I stare at the menu wanting to order more than a dish but well, my stomach capacity is limited. I don't give many reviews, one because I'm rather new to yelp but two, I typically review when it's a place that made my day(s) better and this is one ;)"}
{"text":"We did a to go order.  Bulgogi. Came with side items- the kimchi was delicious! Bulgogi was ok. I wanted more flavor, maybe they should've marinated it longer.  But overall still good and I will go back. You can tell from the the building it use to be an old long john silvers.  Place was empty when we came, but we just did it to go."}
{"text":"ordered the bulgogi, fried dumplings and crab rangoons. The rangoons and dumplings were pretty decent. The bulgogi tasted kind of off, and either the rice or the bulgogi smelled kind of like old socks. I may go back and try something else - see if it was a fluke with the bulgogi. The service was good, food cooked quick. The restaurant itself is not your typical Chinese/Korean restaurant. They've got a picture menu with hamburgers, fish & chips, and gyros in addition to the oriental food."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, and fabulous service!  The young lady that served us took time to explain the menu and each dish to help us Korean novices select our meals.  We shared several dishes and we thrilled with each.  The decor was outdated, similar to an outdated fast food restaurant, but the food made up for ambiance.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I studied at Yonsei University in South Corea for a semester so I am familiar with good Corean food and service.  I had Dolsot Bibimbap and a soup which I cannot remember the name of.  The waitress was very friendly and we talked about Corea for a couple minutes.  The \"service\" was very good by Corean standards since i was given free kimchi and other small dishes when I sat down. And was given a refill on the kimchee during dinner. The waitress was surprised when I asked for rice with my soup because it is a very traditional way of eating soup. Both dishes were very good but next time I will ask for it to be spicier. I will ask for Corean spicy next time. The meal was on the expensive side since I ate both dishes but if I went with my wife we would have ordered the same amount and been satisfied.   I will be back with my wife."}
{"text":"Our favorite Korean restaurant in Charlotte! The Bi Bim Bap and Bulgogi is so delicious. Very friendly service also. Don't be fooled by the name \"China Wing\". When you go in, ask for Korean menu."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff. The owners are Korean and take pride in this restaurant. Make sure to try the dol sot Bibimbap. Delicious."}
{"text":"I had the daeji bulgogi (spicy pork). The sauce was sweet and spicy, and the dish had vegetables in addition to the usual pork and onion. It came with kim chi and pickled radish as side dishes. I think the total price with tip was around twenty dollars. I would come back again."}
{"text":"First Time eating here. First time eating Koren. The young lady who waited on us was very helpful and polite. She helped us with the menu and got us to order some very yummy dishes. Before we were done we had a table full of delicious food. We will be going back here often!!"}
{"text":"Add this to your list of places to try. Food is fresh and exciting and very flavorful. It was so good I had to eat lunch here 2 days in row!"}
{"text":"food taste just as good as my mother's so far from what I have tasted.  price is reasonable,  other korean restaurants Ive been to are priced higher.  I can't believe charlotte has only 2 korean restaurants to eat at!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident.   My family was on the run from hurricane irma and was hungry for Korean meal.   China wing name made us a little skeptical, but we stopped anyway.   Best jajangmun, dukboki, doksul bibimbup.  We will come back anytime we r near.  Btw, I am Korean so I do know the cuisine."}
{"text":"Another great South Blvd. ethnic restaurant.  Had the Jae Yuk Bok Um.  It was great.  Flavorful and spicy.  They were very friendly and happy to recommend and explain items.  My son ate the buffalo wings with fries and they were excellent also."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you. Food is awesome.  Bibimbap is fantastic, and so is the Kimchi fried rice.  Great place and the people are so nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch because of the Yelp reviews I had read. I had the Bibim Naengmyeon, it was really good, the best I've had since actually having it in Korea. I will definitely be going back. The customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"My General Tso is crunchy. Wtf  Place is hot Weird smell Bad part of town How is this ranked#1???? Rice iffy"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a korean vibe restaurant , this is it!!! The people who works there are very accommodating, helpful and friendly! Very highly recommend to visit  and you can try a lot of Chinese and korean , as mine korean delicacy!  great food and korean music background is a plus! Super Lovvveeee it~~~"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and always try to have that one Korean restaurant in every city. This is the go to place for Korean food in Charlotte. It serves Chinese food too but this is an authentic Korean restaurant, they serve Korean bbq barbecue too! Minae who works there is so sweet and makes you feel at home (she was named in the newspaper!). Their Korean appetizers bring back my childhood memories, they're entrees are so good that I eat here for lunch and dinner, everyday. No Korean soju liquor but they do serve beer which is always ice cold and refreshing, go for something local like Sugar Creek White Ale."}
{"text":"The korean food was very flavorful.  It would compare very favorably to restaurants in LA.  The only drawback is that they do not give a wide selection of side dishes (banchan) to  accompany your meal.   The service is wonderful.  The lady is a Jackie-of-all trades, and is very attentive to whatever you may need."}
{"text":"I had much higher expectations for here but have to admit that it is one of the few places I can get Korean in Charlotte. What worries me however is that I visited for the first time as I was coming off of a smoothie cleanse. At that point I'm afraid anything would have satisfied my hunger.  We ordered the Korean-style wings, an order of beef bulgogi and pork dumplings. The wings were meaty and I will say I was a fan of the sauce. However, at just over $1/wing I can't help but feel kind of ripped off.   The bulgogi was one of those things that I was happy to see as I typically only get to indulge in it in New York or DC/Northern VA. I'd say it was \"good\". It was almost \"very good\" but for some reason I kept getting a very \"gamey\" flavor from it. Other than that it was a generous portion and the rest of the flavors hit the spot for what I'd consider decent bulgogi.   That brings us to the dumplings. These I would most certainly pass on! If they weren't from a bag of frozen dumplings from an Asian market then I have serious worries for the cook given that my first attempt at making homemade pork dumplings was light years ahead of what I got out of the dumplings here. Like I said, I can't help but think they were just frozen dumplings and for that I would avoid. I know this can sometimes be difficult when dumplings (otherwise a delicious nugget of goodness) are on the menu.  Service was great! We were in for lunch and although it was just us and another table the server were very attentive and didn't make us feel rushed. Food was prepared and served quickly as well.  I feel like I might be stretching a bit at three stars but given the limited options for Korean in Charlotte I needed to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, I am making it my self-proclaimed mission to seek out and consume some of the other delicious Korean delicacies that do exist in Charlotte (although a little further from Center City than I'd like). Depending on the experiences elsewhere I will be sure to update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall but the food was very good! I really enjoyed the food here and would go again"}
{"text":"Over priced for about of food. Gave 2 stars because the food was decent but it was $14 for veggie lo mein and springs rolls. I should have just went to a restaurant"}
{"text":"This is a family-run business.  The members of the family are charming people.  Stop in and try them out!"}
{"text":"Good service, really good food, do yourself a favor and eat here. Try the Korean food it was very nice. They have beer too."}
{"text":"Excellent place!  Fresh prepared good food.  Good service and wide variety.  Highly recommend.  Always fresh and served perfect."}
{"text":"This \"Chinese\" restaurant serves cheese steaks and looks like an old Captain D's.  Its not bad, its just not that good.  Especially for the price.  If you want me to enjoy mediocre Chinese for lunch it better not be much more than $5.  Plenty of other options out there."}
{"text":"Haven't seen the bill yet but really don't care. Absolutely excellent food all the way around. Don't let the outside appearance discourage you. You will leave fat & very happy!"}
{"text":"- I've driven past this place a few times but was hesitant to stop in to give it a try. The outside looked a little run down so it seemed a bit sketchy to me. The inside could use a little renovating as well as putting the AC on. When we got inside it was quiet and lacked decor. The Korean food here is good, even tho the actual restaurant is deceiving. I must say the bibimbap is better than any other I have tried in the Charlotte area. The bulgogi on the other hand, was good, just average.   One thing I would recommend is to not go on your lunch break. With only 1 person serving the whole place and what seems like only 1 person making the entrees in the back, you're time does get very tight unless you call ahead.   Overall don't judge a book by its cover. What seems to be not appealing on the outside (& inside ) has pretty tasty food."}
{"text":"China Wing... do not be deceived. This is a Korean-owned restaurant. It has a two-fold menu - one Korean, one American-Chinese. It is a little pricey than what we're used to. Think about $4-5 more than an average Korean restaurant for every dish. For example, $15 for ddukgook... DDUKGOOK.   LOCATION South Charlotte, off of Arrowwood. Definitely used to be a fast food restaurant at some point -- the remnants of the drive thru menu are still there.   AMBIANCE Dark, quiet... There were maybe 4 people in the restaurant when we went. I think more people go there for take-out rather than dining in. There are a ton of seats, with some leather booths interspersed within.   FOOD We had the dolsot bibimbap and the seafood soondubu. The Korean food was decent for Charlotte.. don't expect it to compare to Atlanta. It's enough to tie you over until you have time to make your way to Duluth.   Dolsot Bibimbap This is your typical dolsot bibimbap.. but for some reason, something felt off. Maybe it was the lettuce or the danmooji (pickled daikon) or the tomatoes that were chopped... or maybe it was that the gochujang sauce was too sweet for my taste... It definitely was enough to hold me over until I get to Atlanta but not my favorite. The beef that they added into the dish was delicious though - I have to admit. It was marinated in some sort of bulgogi (sweet teriyaki) sauce and was very very tender.    Seafood Soondubu Soondubu, for those who don't know, is a soft tofu soup. It's typically made with a beef broth with super mushy tofu, and topped with green onions and a raw egg that cooks in the broth. The soondubu at China Wing was okay. It doesn't taste quite like mainstream soondubu but it felt very homemade (in a good way-- like how mom would make it). You definitely have to eat it while it's hot because the tofu burned at the bottom by the end. The dish had a heavy helping of seafood mix including shrimp and squid. The broth was mild and light but very eggy (which is not quite what you would expect). Great for cold weather though."}
{"text":"I tried this little spot today, and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great! I had General Tso's, my oldest daughter had sesame chicken, and my youngest daughter had lo mein with fried rice. Everyone was happy...and I also ordered the Korean Wings, which were BANGING! My order was great, and it was perfectly spicy, without over-flouring the chicken. Seriously, the chicken was pretty much all meat. Will I be back? OH YEAH! Too bad they don't deliver...well, that's a good thing, that way I don't get fat. LOL! I definitely recommend China Wing. I need to try more from their Korean menu as well, but I was extremely pleased overall with the Korean wings and the Chinese food. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Although this place is called China Wing they do also have a separate Korean menu which is actually all I've tried there.  The owners are a Korean family so I figured I try that menu over the Chinese menu which is, I'm guessing, what the majority of their customers order from.  The Korean dishes are a little pricier than the Chinese dishes but the portions are much bigger and they all come with soup, kimchi and radishes usually.  So far I've had their galbi, bulgogi, omul rice, tangsuyok and bibimbap and all are delicious.  Service can be a little slow at times especially during the lunch rush and they're understaffed, I believe the owners son is the only one working the floor! They also have a drive-thru which is a little strange (the restaurant was obviously some fast food place before) and I've never ordered from it.  Aside from those few \"flaws\" the food has always been delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered Sesame Chicken- carryout postive: - tasty fried rice- smoked flavor - egg rolls- very good  negative: sesame chicken tasted bad, the chicken had an awful smell and taste to it. I had to throw it out.   Don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I have been desperate to find a Korean restaurant since moving to Charlotte only to find that a place called \"China Wing\" five minutes from my house was it.  The place lacks decor, but I wasn't there for that anyway.  Grabbed some bibimbap and kimchi jiggae for lunch ($12-$13 each) and was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty good.  The service was great - waitress really attentive.  I would have given 4 stars if the side dishes were better.  The picked radish wasn't the taste I was hoping for and the others were just a little more bland than I'm used to.  Nevertheless, I will be back and will probably be ordering their lunch special while working at home during the weekdays.  $5.99 with free sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean food you can find in Charlotte area... don't get confused about the name, they are Korean not a Chinese. So I will go with Korean menu. Been to Korea so many times plus I personally a big fan of Korean food, this place get the job done well. You can request \"authentic\" flavor means less sweet more spicy, they will accommodate you very well.  One star off for - location, not the nicest neighborhood you want to be in... environment, the place deserves a nice make over... price, a bit of overprice compare to NYC or Boston, but I guess I don't quite have a choice for Living in Charlotte..."}
{"text":"I LOVE AUTHENTIC FOOD!  If you want that cultural vibe on the food that you eat you have to come here. It may look a little rough on the outside but it is definitely the what is in the inside that counts.   This local grubbery is a must try. They have a variety of Korean and Chinese food. Both are great options. THE WINGS ARE A MUST!!   The service was very pleasing. Our waiter was very nice to give us some paper towels to dry off since we happened to walk in when the monsoon decided to hit on Sunday evening. The service was quick, attentive, and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte to have Korean food. The spicy pork bibimbap is really good, and you have to try the korean chicken wings."}
{"text":"Nice variety sure to please anyone in your party. They have chicken wings, gyros, seafood, Chinese entrees, and Korean dishes.  Great lunch specials for $5.55, including a drink...but not their Korean menu. We went for the Korean (ask for the special menu)...and we were not disappointed. I stuck with a traditional Korean favorite, Bibimbop. It was delicious! Swirl all the ingredients together and add some of their red pepper paste (which is really thick) and you've got yourself a hearty and scrumptious meal! Between my husband and I, we both agreed that the best part is the rice that cooked to the bottom of the hot pot...crunchy! By the way, I think it's genius to have it in a clay hot pot, every bite is just as hot as the first.   Highlights of this restaurant:  1. Like in many Latino establishments, they play novelas..here, they play Korean dating shows and Korean music. 2. If you are up to trying something new, no worries, they have a photo of every item on their menu. Point to order! 3. The booths are pulled away from the walls. Might not be a big deal to you, but it warranted a lunchtime conversation. 4. Friendly service!  Go support a local business and try something new and exciting!"}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the portions are small, the banchan selection is very limited, and the prices are extremely high for what you get. It's hard to justify spending so much. I was hoping to have an alternative to Pepero that is closer to home, but this isn't it."}
{"text":"BOOM!   You are missing out if you dont try this place.  No frills. No froo froo atmosphere.  Just really good Korean BBQ.   I have been trying to get here for a while and was finally able to sucker a friend into going.    It is a little pricey for the portions but still damn good Korean.  I will be back most definately."}
{"text":"This place is close to the house and doesn't look very good on the outside, but the inside is nice, and the food is awesome. I feel like I need to clarify why this place is called China Wing but everyone talks about the Korean food here. In Korea, Chinese restaurants are very popular and abundant but they put a Korean twist on the food they make causing it to turn into almost a fusion type cuisine such as jajangmyun which Koreans would consider chinese food but is very distinctly Korean in nature. I guess the proprietors here kept with their Korean roots and opened up a fairly Korean Chinese place. The more you know!  Anyways on to the actual review, the owners here seem very friendly. The guy on the register remembered me on the second time I came here to eat, which is impressive considering there was a pretty lengthy amount of time in between visits. I almost always order the bibimbap which is delicious and freshly made. It also comes with a nice side of kimchi, pickled daikon, and small bowl of soup. prices are reasonable, and at the end of our meal they usually throw in some stuff for free. The first time I ate here they gave us some orange slices at the end of our meal, and the second time some hot tea!  This is a nice place for some decent Korean food, they also have an American, and Chinese menu as well. They've recently added delivery service so that's awesome for the lazy times you don't want to go anywhere! Seeing as there aren't many Korean restaurants in Charlotte, this was a nice find and I'll be back whenever I have cravings for Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of good food!!! They have everything from Kimchi to Philly steak subs and more! China Wing is a great mixed of traditional Korean, Chinese and American foods and the food is amazing! Coming in from a vegetarian side this is the only place (that I know of) that has General Tso TOFU!!!!!!!! and it is amazingggg!!!! They have really great rice too, if you are a rice fanatic like myself. Other dishes I like are the broccoli and garlic sauce, Vegetable fried rice and delicious spring rolls! BIG BIG fan of this place and I would recommend them to everyone! Only down side  is that they don't delivery but the food is so good it is worth actually putting on pants for! Price is not too bad..dinner for 2 was about $27. I never ate on the inside, just take out but it seems clean and the staff are really nice and they remember you....which could be because they are super awesome or I just go there way to much!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch or dinner spot. The food is super cheap, lunch is $5.55 with a drink, or about $6.50 for dinner with a ton of food.  The ingredients are all fresh, none of this sitting in a pot stewing all day. The veggies taste farm fresh and they make everything right when you order it. The staff is friendly and the service is good. Family owned and operated, and the portions are appropriately sized.  The only thing lacking is the atmosphere, which is to be expected at the price point, I just hate that they serve gyros and chicken wings and what not, it kinda kills the vibe of their absolutely excellent cheap chinese."}
{"text":"Even though the restaurant is called China Wing this place has the best,  and extensive authentic Korean food in Charlotte. The next best Korean restaurant to Korea town in Atlanta. Definitely come here for some Korean food. Everything is good here."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Priced great with the huge amount of food you get! I ordered to go General Tso chicken and egg rolls.  Chicken and rice was moist and right amount of spice.  Egg rolls were large and crunchy."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and LOVE it!! The best chicken wings, fried rice and crab Rangoon's in Charlotte! Even better they have a drive through! Family owned and knows who I am from my voice over the phone."}
{"text":"Alright. This is MY spot! Just moved from NY and couldn't find a dope Chinese spot. Here it is! Kind of sketchy at first but do not judge from the outside! Very friendly environment once you're inside. I only eat beef and broccoli and I'm picky with different restaurants. I don't like my beef to taste raw and chewy and they perfect it for me (after ordering it well done) The portions are huge! I'm currently here for the second time waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Best Korean food around. Generally they only offer two side dishes with the entree. Kim Chee and preserved turnips. Today I had the Summer Bim Bim Bap with Spicy Pork. As always the food was delicious and the portions were just right."}
{"text":"Came here for quick Korean food.  Ordered the beef bulgogi.  I ate the whole dish by myself!  Don't judge before trying the food!"}
{"text":"Will come out of the gate by saying the food and service is outstanding. The menu has an extremely wide variety of items but make no mistake about it, this is a Korean restaurant first and foremost, but given the surrounding neighborhood i understand why they have other non Korean items to appeal to the varied tastes. But that in itself speaks volumes as they can make a traditional Korean dish and at the same time a Greek Gyro sandwich, both of which are top shelf. Have eaten in only, never take out and will say that the interior is nothing fancy, but it is very clean. It is family owned so they take a great deal of pride in their place and their product and the young lady behind the counter, and waiting tables, and busing them is just a doll and a sweet person. And she is as fluent with her Spanish as she is with her english and Korean. Rare to find someone like her, always happy and smiling and working hard 6 to 7 days a week. We heard about this through the Food Network when they praised their Korean Style Wings. Agreed, these are awesome, but so are the many other Korean dishes we have tried. Top shelf, and if you like to eat Korean, GO HERE!"}
{"text":"China Wing is a hidden gem. It's a unique experience. Half-Korean, half-Chinese menu all under the roof of an old fast food drive-thru building. I go here for the Korean food. I've had the staples of bulgolgi and bibimbap; both solid. Do not expect a full service or quality of a traditional Korean restaurant. Still consider it as a fast food joint but with waitstaff...and beer!  There is a serious lack of Korean restaurants in Charlotte but this place can feed my cravings without having to go all the way to Matthews."}
{"text":"I absolutely love China Wing. They have Chinese and Korean food. While I've never had the Korean style, I can say that the Chinese is some of the best in town. Its not like other places where the food sits in a pot all day and you can barely tell if you're eating chicken; they make it fresh to order. They also have $6 lunch specials Monday - Saturday and it includes a drink (not something you see much anymore)."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Outside of pe pe ro, im not aware of many places that serve korean food.  I looked at some of the pics and saw the fried thuk and instantly remembered my mom making that a few times.  Of course i had to try.  I also ordered the kimbab, bot appetizers but as a meal.  Both were very good.  The thuk was tender and spicy sweet and the kimbab wss excellent,  very fresh tasting.   The rest of the family ordered dolsot bibimbap which was excellent"}
{"text":"DO NOT be fooled by its location! This is my go-to place for good Korean food in Charlotte. I tried the ja jang myun and it was really good. It is a little pricy but the portion is huge. I will definitely come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"friendly people who work here (love the service!!) , but bad food (fake crab in crab Rangoon! with ketchup for sauce) small portions and cheap ingredients. they don't have an official menu posted online, but the menu I did find gave totally inaccurate pricing and said all lunch specials came with an egg roll (which they do not)   I will not be returning to China Wing. Gives a whole new meaning to cheap Chinese."}
{"text":"I went to China Wing for a Bibimbap for lunch and it was delicious. It came with a side of kimchi and everything just tasted authentic like you are in Seoul. It's definitely comfortable \"Seoul food\". The bibimpbap was served in a hot stone bowl so the heat of the food lasted till the final scoop of rice which was perfect for the winter. The portion was perfect, it had just right balance of rice, vegetables and meat so that each scoop of rice was accompanied by a bite of meat or vegetable. This is by no means a negative comment but I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live (Waxhaw) so that I can go there more. They would definitely do well if they are located in Ballantyne/Blakeley area!"}
{"text":"Ordered Korean street platter, jajiangmyun , and spicy bibimbap. The rice cake stick is amazing crispy,sweet and spicy. Noodles are super good too.bibimbap is not really worth the price as the spicy pork is not that tasty and the rice is a little under seasoning but crispy~"}
{"text":"The naengmyeon was soooo good! And the customer service was great"}
{"text":"I was in the area attending an event with my son. Dropped him off and went to do a little shopping and then I got hungry. I looked on the Yelp reviews and found this place and it seem to have above average ratings. So I decided to give it a try. The young lady at the cash register was very friendly and gave me recommendations. I ordered a mix of the fried wings and fried shrimp with the vegetable rice. Honestly, the best thing was the vegetable rice. The wings were those little tiny drumettes And they were dry and tough to chew. I ordered them honey barbecue style and they just literally poured a little bit of honey barbecue sauce on them. It wasn't soaked in the sauce so therefore it didn't permeate through to the meat. The fried shrimp honestly look like they came out of the frozen box of shrimp you get at the grocery store. The vegetable rice was good and flavorful. I don't live on this side of town so it's highly unlikely that I will stop in this place again but if I were on the side of town again I'd skip it."}
{"text":"This place is def.an example of not judging a book by its cover. Its kinda in the hood...a converted Long John Silvers that serves Chinese and Korean foods(interesting concept). Its the kind of place that I would normally drive right past but saw that received good reviews and I didn't want to pay $15 for Chinese in the Southpark area near my office.  The lunch special is $5.99 with a free sweet tea. Good deal. I ordered chicken and broccoli with rice. The portion size was smaller than normal Chinese food portion sizes but it was also lunch time. The food was good. The chicken was good quality, not overly sauced, and the broccoli was crisp. The service was good as well. The cashier(maybe owner) talked with me while my order was prepared so that was nice. I will definitely be back to try some of the Korean specialities on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service. My 14 year old son absolutely loves their Korean. We all do but he actually requests it daily."}
{"text":"Korean food was good, better than most of the Thai & Chinese places in the area. Orders house special rice & wings & Korean bibimbap (mix rice with beef and veges). All tasted good."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the first time.  It was delicious so we came back this week to try more.  This time we had the wings and bulgogi, both of which were fantastic.  The proprietor remembered us and made a recommendation for our next visit which will probably be soon."}
{"text":"Delicious! Amazing Korean quisine. Great vegetarian options as well.  Would give 5 stars but decor and style is severely lacking.  Hostess/waitress is VERY knowledgeable about the dishes and options available (not to mention beautiful, which has no bearing on her job of course)."}
{"text":"Much like Jon Snow I know nothing about Korean food. Nothing. But one fateful night the man and I were watching MasterChef and on came a challenge to make a bibimbap. At the end of the episode we decided we had to find this sizzling crispy rice dish in Charlotte and Yelp led us to an unlikely establishment - China Wing.   China Wing is housed in a building that was a fast food establishment in a former life across from a Compare Foods Supermarket. The first time we went we were more than a little dubious. However the food we've had both times has been absolutely delicious and worth the journey!  My absolute favorite dish here is the dolsot bibimbap which comes packed with vegetables and served with various sides. The beef is surprisingly flavorful. The whole dish is served in a solid bowl and still sizzling when it comes to the table, crisping the rice on the bottom while you take the obligatory snap / insta / Yelp picture. Normally I can take or leave kimchee but here it was delicious. The waitress was super friendly both times we went and she was more than happy to answer our many questions and make recommendations.   Even though I don't know anything about Korean food I can say the food here is amazing and I can't wait to go back and venture even further into their menu.  PS - I have a song dedicated to this place. Set to the same beat as \"MMMbop\" I sing it on the drive over. It goes biiiimbap um um bibimbap bibibibibimbapppp."}
{"text":"Come here whenever I need a Fix for my Korean food cravings. Their bulgulgi is always sizzling and my favorite is their flavorful soups. Great for a rainy day or any day."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to finally visit China Wing, which to my knowledge is the closest place to me where Korean food is served.  China Wing looks like it used to be a Long John Silver or similar fast food joint. In order to make it the Korean owners serve a variety of American fast food in addition to the full Korean menu. You want the Korean menu, which has detailed descriptions of the dishes and photographs of most of the options, making it less intimidating for first-timers.  I was pleased with everything we ordered including the delicious Korean seafood and scallion pancake, the noodle dish japchae, the BBQ pork and the bi bimbap, a personal favorite. One disappointment was that the selection of banchan or panchan - tiny dishes, often pickled served with the meal - was limited to just 2: tasty kimchi and pickled radish. At other places (of course I'm comparing to Atlanta) you get at least 4-5 different options or possibly more. Still, I can't complain since the main dishes and the banchan we were given were delicious and definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving for Korean food. I look forward to returning to China Wing and to visiting the other Korean restaurants in the area. I also look forward to visiting my favorite Korean spots back in Atlanta when we visit! Where have you had Korean cuisine in Charlotte? Super G Mart and Cho Wan Garden are on my list."}
{"text":"You know why I'm here...I came for the wings. While I haven't tried much else on the menu besides the gyro and the philly, I must say the wings are finger licking good. I've never been disappointed with them. I tried their fried rice once, but it's nothing to rave about. My only complaint is the long wait time, but I guess that's the price you pay when your food is made fresh."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have even considered stopping into China Wing if not for being brought in here by my good friend. It's like a hidden gem hole in the wall in Charlotte. It's truly unassuming and even the name is a bit un-fitting. It brings to mind those China Ones and China Kings and other generically named Chinese take-outs that are a staple in every Food Lion shopping center across the south east. China Wing, despite the name, is almost anything but.  Inside you'll find they've set up shop inside what used to be a fast food restaurant. Surprising to me, the daughter of the owners informed us they've been here for 20 years. This daughter of the owners actually took our orders and served us our food. Her and her parents are actually Korean, not Chinese. To be fair, one of the neon signs outside does say they do Korean food too. If you ask me I'd say they should change the name to Korea Wing simply because they seem to do that best. I also find it more unique.  I ordered a bowl of bibimbap. Easily my favorite Korean dish I haven't had it in years. It was just as good as I remember. An assortment of veggies, beef, rice and an over-easy egg in a searing hot bowl. When you get it you let it sizzle a bit to crisp the rice in the bottom. Then you stir it up and have at it. If you fear the spiciness of Korean food this is one sure-fire way to avoid it. Their menu is basically divided with Chinese food on one side and Korean on the opposite. An interesting fusion item I'd like to try here some day is the bulgogi cheesesteak. The cheesebulgogi in a word.  The prices were a bit high in my opinion. About $12-13 for the bibimbap. Although this isn't usually a cheap-o dish. Maybe they have better lunch-time deals too. I intend to go back again regardless!"}
{"text":"Let's get it out of the way first: The China Wing is not fancy by any stretch of the imagination (unless of course you are looking up at their banners advertising the food - somewhat inexplicably, those look like they are handled by a corporation with a mammoth advertising budget, not a place housed in what appears to be a former Captain D's now on at least it's third go-round).  Some years ago, this used to be a relatively simple, but modestly priced and good value for the dollar quick-serve hibachi place. Perhaps that is where the name came from. I really have no clue, but they still serve some of those dishes. Now, however, they are also one of the few locations in Charlotte where you can find Korean, and for that it is a worthy destination.  Of special interest here is the bibimbop - served with an egg, in a real (clay?) dish and everything, not just a simple styrofoam container. The service is excellent and the flavors are solid - the only complaint (other than needing a bit of a makeover, but don't we all?) is that the dish is perhaps served a bit too hot, as you may burn your mouth if you try and eat right away. This is not the typical Mexican food \"hot plate\" warning. This is just about don't taste anything for a few hours warning, so you might want to give it a few minutes to cool off, otherwise you won't enjoy it at all.  The best bet is to break the egg, combine the flavors together and let it sit for a minute (or perhaps even a few), then enjoy those flavors.  Beyond that, definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"I had pretty good authentic bibimbap at a place called China Wing, even though owned by Koreans. Yep - that's the South for you. However, it is easier to find and more of a dining room feel than PePeRo, despite the Wendy's(?) layout that I presume was in that location before.  The service was great and the food was good. A bit pricey for the ambience but you pay for authentic food. I'm sure people do come here for the cheaper Chinese food which I'll come back to try along with the other Korean dishes, like the wings."}
{"text":"Driving up to China Wing was a little confusing.  I desperately was looking for some delicious Korean food (being 1/2 Korean) during my biz trip to Charlotte and found this little gem named, oddly enough, China Wing.  This is a family owned business that serves delicious and authentic Korean dishes as well as Chinese and some Greek food.  Unusual combination, but if you have picky eaters in your group then know there are other options to choose from.  During my frequent travels to the city, I've enjoyed eating at China Wing at least 5 times.  I've gotten to know the waitress and have brought colleagues to the restaurant to eat.  Again, I'm glad the menu had options for picky eaters.    The dolsot bibimbap is delish.  The spicy pork is yummo.  The kimchi is right on.  My mother would probably be more critical as she is an amazing Korean cook, but I will certainly return for future meals.   Always great, friendly, and personal service.  The prices are very affordable for Korean cuisine in Charlotte.  Don't let the building fool you.  Try it then decide for yourself.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, worse service.  Nasty, you can see nasty in the kitchen.  Not good Korean.  GO TO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place though it's been awhile since I've been there. Based on the decor I was kinda iffy about trying it with my friend but it turned out to be really good. They have really good Korean food!"}
{"text":"For those Charlotte transplants from other big cities like LA or NYC, this is definitely one of the places to go for some solid authentic Korean-Chinese dishes like jajangmyeon, jampong, and bibimbap.  These are the three dishes that I've had from here over the course of a few months.  I can't wait to try them all!  I wanted to give this place 5 stars, climb atop a nearby mountain and shout out how their place is awesome... but man, they give you side dishes of kimchi and radish.  Both were waaaaaaay to fermented to the point that the radish side was a little yellowed and tasted bitter from being old.  Keep the radish fresher at least!  Kinda lazy on an early Friday evening before going out, so I'm not gonna break down dishes and stuff and what I thought.  People that have had Korean food from Koreatown in LA or NY or wherever would consider their food to be legit.  It appears the place is owned by Koreans, so much props to my peeps for making good Korean food.  The dude who was there was about my age and a pretty cool dude.  Friendly.  Oh yeah, they have all this other stuff on the menu too like wings and stuff, but I have no clue if it's good.  Go for the Korean!   dmo out."}
{"text":"They have changed the price of the menu. It is more expensive. I have eaten a not-big plate with normal rice and chicken with 7.99. You had better spend a little bit more money to get a lunch buffet instead of choosing this place. (If you want to fill your stomach) And there are no lunch specials anymore. So disappointed :("}
{"text":"If you are looking for homemade, authentic Korean cuisine, this quaint spot has it! The owners are very kind, the decor isn't fancy but who cares, the food is delicious. Always take friends who want Korean here."}
{"text":"The bi bam bap is fantastic! Friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love their crab ragoons!!!!! Everything is made hot and fresh!  And super friendly employees!"}
{"text":"Probably my second favorite place as far as korean food goes in Charlotte. Service is quick and food is good. They cary a variety of food selection from chinese to korean to burgers and then gyro. As far as korean food goes,  I would recommend their galbi, kimchi soup and gamjatang."}
{"text":"China Wing is a place that I eat at and never thought  of reviewing. They are always consistent with what they bring to the table which is Chinese and Korean food. This place is a no frills but great service kind of atmosphere. We got an order of 10 piece lemon pepper wings, spicy pork Bibimbop, and an order of Galbi.   Our food was all good, it was a great variety of sides but to break it down...  The lemon pepper wings had a sweet almost honey sauce on them which had me licking my fingers! I really liked it and have never seen a place dress up lemon pepper wings like that. The wings were crispy and juicy!   I had the Galbi which was seasoned well and my boyfriend had the bibimbop which came out really hot! All was great and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I love Korean food and this is the only one on this side of town in Charlotte but they are too dang expensive.. Their Korean pancake cost as much as an entree.. G Mart Korean restaurant is much better as far as taste and you get bigger portions. This will do when I can't make it to the other side"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a million times, but never ventured in. I got a crazy hankering for some Lo Mein the other day and since I was in the area, I popped in for lunch and ordered a little pork Lo Mein to go.   The woman that took my order was very nice and my order came out in record time! I actually ordered it spicy because I saw it was an option and while they did put some ground red pepper in it or something, but it was nowhere near spicy enough for me. I think they gave me the wimpy version. Next time, I'll make sure to let them know to go crazy with the chilies and such.   I was very pleased with the service, flavor and atmosphere, so I'll definitely be back. I'm so glad I decided to give it a go!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the Korean food here and was very happy with it (cha chang myun, bi bim bap).  Good price, and tastes very good.  The cha chang myun is just as good as any I've tried in California."}
{"text":"I stopped at Choi's China Wing after an extra long work day.  I was tired and didn't want to cook. If I had to describe China Wing I'd say it's the Sybil of restaurants.  Not that that's a bad thing.  They have wings, burgers, Philly cheese steaks, gyros, fried fish, Chinese and Korean on  their menu.  The restaurant was clean, well maintained and inviting.  The prices were reasonable compared to other places. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken along with and order fo 5 hot wings.  It was late and there was only one couple in the place.  It took a little longer to get my order than usually takes at other Chinese take out places, but it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes or so.  I got my food and headed home.  The Kung Pao wasn't quite what I've had at other places.  I haven't had much Korean food, but it tasted like a little Korean style flavoring was added in. But again that is not a bad thing, it was still very good.  The hot wings were a little on the small side I thought, but very flavorful and well cooked.  They were only $3.95 for an order of five wings.  Overall I'd recommend China Wing if you are looking to grab a bite to eat but can't decide what you want.  I'm gonna stop back some time and try some of the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"There doesn't seem to be that many Korean places in Charlotte... I know of maybe 4 or so, and driving up to China Wing you'd never really guess this has some of awesome Korean fare. From the outside it looks like yet another crappy, MSG-ridden, over-sauced American-Chinese hell hole. Even when you walk inside, you're still not totally sold you walked into the right place...   Boy, are YOU wrong for thinking that! I've been here twice and both times I've been very impressed by their Korean food. I don't know how their Chinese or American dishes are since I never get them, but the Korean dishes are great!  This time I had the Dolsot Bibimbap and it was very well serviced. The cute cashier asked me if I'd ever had it before, to which I lied and said no. She gave me a very nice and friendly lesson on the dish, the name and what it means all while practically prepping it for me and serving it. She stirred my pot (no pun intended) and suggested how to eat it and what not. Very nice.  Before my Bibimbap arrived they bring out a bowl of shredded chicken soup, some kimchi and this sweet pickled radish with sugar which was out of this world.  So, all in all, it was a great visit, great food, great service and great info.  But let's knock off a couple stars.  One because I've had better Korean food and because when you first walk in, you can get a little confused between the Chinese and Korean and hamburger signs on the wall.  The second star was lost (and I'm being nice here as I usually knock off two stars for this sin) because they serve you unfiltered water. I HATE IT when a restaurant serves me unfiltered water. It's disgusting and unclean and it can ruin your meal. I only took a sip and thought about sending it back. But figured the girl had been nice enough and the food was good enough that I could do without."}
{"text":"Excellent bi bim bap. Awesome service. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to get some awesome Korean and Chinese food. I think the name China Wing is simply for familiarity of Chinese cuisine among the community in the South. But they have some great tasting Korean food. Highly recommended! Very welcome staffs. Probably the best place for Korean food in town!"}
{"text":"From outside I said oh this is going to be bad. The place was quiet but what a surprise. The soup was amazing, so were the spring rolls. I was looking for hot and sour soup so the waitress said they have something similar egg-drop with the hot and sour but no tofu.  It was sooo good. The prices a a bit higher than I thought they woudl be but it was totally worth it. I will be back for sure. My husband had Beep and Boop and it was excellent as well. Well done China Wing"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here so my review is strictly based on service. I called and was promptly answered with \"Hello.\" I was a little confused, but proceeded to ask my question. What's your lunch special? Answered with wings and rice $7. Does that include Korean wings? No. Ok great, thank you! She promptly hangs up phone, no questions asked. CLICK! Will not ever be doing business with these people...EVER!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews including the endorsements from my K-Town peeps, I went out on a limb and ordered jajangmyun and Korean fried chicken. Oh no. You guys really let me down. First, it wasn't authentic . . . which I suppose it doesn't have to be, but the recipe and delivery was also poor. I'll give this place another try because quite frankly if you want Korean in Charlotte, your choices are this limited."}
{"text":"This place is a Korean run restaurant.  Don't know why they decided to call it China Wing.  Only if you look at the sign do you realize it's a Chinese/Korean restaurant.    The food here isn't spectacular, but it is still decent Korean food.  They have a $4.95 lunch special, but that only applies to Chinese food.  The nice part is, they serve the elusive Korean-Chinese fare, that you can't find at Korean or Chinese only restaurants.  JJa jang myun, ggampoongi, omul rice, tangsuyok to name a few.  The prices are a tad high, but it's still worth a visit."}
{"text":"I quickly learned that the Korean food scene is pretty non-existent in the Charlotte area. I have actually put off writing this review with hopes of coming back but that hasn't happened.  I ordered jap chae and bulgogi. The food is good but pricey. I paid $30 for two dishes and was surprised at how small my containers were. The bulgogi was tender but not the super thin cuts of meat I was anticipating. It was more chunky but still tasty. The jap chae noodles were on the very soft side. I am very familiar with sweet potato noodles and I just felt that they were not cooked fresh, had been sitting for a while and warmed up with fresh veggies on my order. I could be wrong and maybe they just over boiled them but I wasn't impressed.  I have wanted to go back just to try their bibimbap but just haven't yet. If I get a hankering for Korean and I am going to spend as much I spent, I rather go to the Asian market and make everything my self."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Found a metal coil in my bulgolgi, I don't know how the waitress could've missed it as it was on top and hanging out. Did anyone check my food before serving? Had it remade, tasted precooked and headed up, beef was very chewy and not very flavorful.   But eh, what can you expect from a fast food, Chinese-Korean fusion?"}
{"text":"The market forces them to have less bonchon selection, but grateful they are here.  (Dolsot bibimbap - pictured)"}
{"text":"I lived in Asia, and pretty familiar with Korean quisine. This is very mediocre, non-authentic Asian food restaurant with pricey dishes!  I ordered shrimp japchae, and a small portion costed me $14! They don't give you any additional sides with it like all other authentic Korean places do.  To be fair, the dish was pretty tasty, so giving them 2 stars.  Place is small, not cozy and nice, I wouldn't want to sit there and eat, take-out is the best way to go if you really want to try this place out"}
{"text":"Food was decent for what it is.  Generous portions,friendly counter guy. Place probably would fail a health inspection thou. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Good food and a drive thru too. All kinds of food from asian specialties to wings...hmmmmm"}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I paid over $40 for Chinese takeout. Quite a shock- serves me right for ordering food post hangover without a glance at any of the prices!  The fried dumplings were crispy, and the spicy sauce was a change from other takeout places I've tried, which send you home with plain soy sauce to dunk your dumplings in. My friend had teriyaki wings and fries. We spilt the Korean BBQ wings, which were pretty good, but not as mouth watering as the ones we've had at Seoul Food across town.  What I enjoyed the most was the shrimp lo mein. I noticed that it was soaked with sauce, which is what I usually deal with at other places. I never paid it much mind before, but I prefer it this way. I suppose it's just lightly tossed as opposed to saturated with grease, but the flavor did not suffer one bit. I had to leave it for the next day after stuffing myself with wings and dumplings. Certainly worth the slightly higher cost than other takeout places in the area."}
