{"text":"Great food and the service was outstanding!  The only complaint was that while eating in, the noise/ clanging from the guy at the grill was so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation.  I'll be back for sure but maybe to go."}
{"text":"Don't know what would make it any better... great sandwich... they make the steak almost right in front of you, it taste great, they have cheese wizz  but it isn't on the menu? Great!!!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint family establishment where the customer service is superb! I will recommend the philly cheese steak, had it once and usually always do!"}
{"text":"After walking in, it was obvious this was a small family run business.  I ordered the Buffalo chicken cheesesteak and my friend ordered the original Philly.  Both were quite tasty.  The fries were thicker than normal but were cooked to a nice and crunchy golden color.  The staff was friendly and the place was quite busy although does not have much indoor seating for larger groups.  I will probably go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a cheesesteak today.  They make a good one.  Not the best but still very tasty.  What really impressed me was their customer service.  All 4 employees there were very friendly and welcoming.  It looked like a family with a mom and daughter taking customer orders and father ad son on the grill.  They all smile when they talk to you and treat you right.  I like a little more cheese on my cheesesteak but I would eat here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks ever! Get the extra whiz on it and prepare for your mind to be blown! I'm totally addicted to this place and always look forward to going! The family that works there are friendly and nice it adds to the overall experience of eating there."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Shonell did a wonderful job with our order and was very nice!!! The philly's are on point and are not soggy at all, just right and taste wonderful."}
{"text":"Rita and Eddie have passion for what they are doing, and what they are doing is producing delicious Philly food. I have been there twice, today I met their sister Megan who is as friendly as the other too.   The first time I went, I was sceptical, and was surprised how delicious the Italian hoagie was; soft roll, fresh meats and  cheese and fresh tomatoes.  Today I had another Italian hoagie (for later) and a cheese steak. Once again, blown away.  I had my favorites in metro-phoenix that I have been going to over the past two decades and Philly 's just went to the top."}
{"text":"Awesome Cheesesteaks using cheese whiz!  Great customer service, everyone is treated like a friend.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This hit the spot for a cheesesteak craving.  I loved the cheese wiz option and the bread was delicious. Would be even better if you could add hot peppers or jalapenos mmm. not an everyday indulgence but once in awhile it is so good."}
{"text":"In Phoenix from out of town. Always looking for a good non-chain restaurant to grab a bite. I couldn't have been more pleased. Great philly."}
{"text":"Authentic. Legitimate Phila cuisine. Amoroso rolls, amazing! Highly recommended - from a Phila native transplanted to AZ. Thank you for a real cheesesteak, I'm so tired of the poor imitations from so many shops out here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is very hole-in-the wall but there is an awesome back east feel from the family who runs it .  They take pride in what they make and it shows! This is not a commercialized chain with generic food, so if that's what your looking for keep moving on... The walls are full of back east pics, specials are all hand written on a whiteboard. Real cozy and familiar feel! on any given day you can hear the whole family bantering and arguing back and forth as t hey serve up the best Phillys in az bar none in a down to earth casual little restaurant Just try it once and you'll be back again and again! P.s they do it right with real whiz!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time at lunch the other day. Genuinely friendly and really nice owners. Very welcoming to everyone coming in. I had the Philly. The meat was so thin, tender and perfectly cooked. The roll is nice and soft, but holds together well. Free refills on the beverages is always nice. Going to definitely go back for more to support a family owned business."}
{"text":"I've lived around the corner from this place for 12 years, and finally decided to give them a try - boy what a disappointment. I honestly don't see the big deal about what they feed you. The sandwich not being a healthy choice, I can deal with, but charging for cheese for a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich I feel is criminal. I voiced my opinion to the owner, and asked him if he's ever been to Philly; he simply said it's been that way since he got the place from the previous guy. I explained to him that I'm in the food business, and that they've got  it wrong, and by definition this sandwich automatically comes with cheese not being a n extra charge, but he could care less. Myself, I would have comp my first-time customer the cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and anything else they wanted, just to share a good experience. That's the difference between someone who's in the food business for profit verses for love of food. On the flip side, I guess I should be thankful that they were not accommodating; saving me from packing on an extra pound. I will not frequent this place again, or recommend it to anyone I know. I did not care much for the sandwich, and only ate 2 bites - I felt it was lacking in flavor and texture, and I know the cook did not put any love into it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but this time I just had to leave a review. I'm from Baltimore and would go up to philly every other week to enjoy the city and get a banging cheese steak. This reminds me of some of the best I've ever had. Today I got the belly filler because I wanted something a little different. I always thought the normal cheese steaks were a little lacking on the cheese here but this one. Oh god. Just oozing cheese. They FTBU with cheese. It might have been the best cheese steak I've ever consumed. I love this place. Oh and if you want to go for lunch, CALL AHEAD. I always do and it's always just getting ready when I arrive. You get to bypass on the lines and waiting petrons. Anyway, amazing."}
{"text":"Wow, first timer at Philly's. I could tell it was going to be good because the owner was a true Philadelphian. I told him it was my first time. He was so friendly and suggested a couple of popular steak and cheese sandwiches and he gave me a little sample while  I was waiting. The steak and cheese was amazing. The bread is the best. We will definitely be going back to Philly's famous. Super super nice people."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the noise and the poor decor, dated seats, tables, and frankly slow service was a real turn off.  My ears are still ringing from banging on the grill."}
{"text":"I've been in here more times than I can count in the 20 months since I moved here from Pennsylvania and this is the ONLY place that gets anywhere close to a decent cheesesteak! Their food is delicious & I take everyone here to introduce them to a real Philly cheesesteak. Granted, its a rather \"hole in the wall\" place, but aren't those the best??? It's not fancy inside, but is adorned with Philadelphia memorabilia. It is family owned AND operated. On a busy Saturday it can be rough to find a place to sit, but eat there you must because no place can compare in food or friendliness. This is my favorite place to eat in Chandler and they know me by name and by order!! I cannot say enough good about this place!!! Love, love, love it. Wish there were more than 5 stars because this place would have it!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Super friendly service. They have great weekly lunch specials. We had the\"Belly Filler\" ."}
{"text":"Always packed for lunch. Great food friendly service . Would recommend . Very few places live up to the hype"}
{"text":"Very nice people that serve great cheesesteak.  We will be back for sure.  Price is good as well ~$12 per person."}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of reviews on here but tonight I needed to do one for this place! I've gone here several times and it's always good but tonight was even better! My man behind the grill tonight hooked it up! This was one of the best cheese steaks I've ever had! Everything about it was awesome and the extra cheese I ordered for it was the best topping for it!  I'm a customer for life...everyone that works there is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time today for lunch. I had an excellent experience there, the food was amazing as was the customer service. I have passed by their location numerous times and now will make it a point to visit at least once a week. Can't wait for my next Philly cheese steak fix"}
{"text":"Very good! I have never experienced an authentic cheesesteak sandwich from Philly so I can't comment on that but this was the best I've had. Staff is friendly and they even have Tang on tap. My only regret is I didn't order a 12\" sandwich!"}
{"text":"Never been to Philly so I can't tell you what an authentic cheesesteak looks or tastes like. I can tell you that the service here is exceptional and the food is pretty good. The first time I ate here, I was not impressed, at all. After a year or so of coming here about once a week for my lunch break, I can tell you that I am a fan, and since Joey behind the counter greets me by my first name when I walk in, I guess that makes me a regular. I usually come in around 11:30, just before the rush, so I get hear some of the conversations going on behind the counter in regards to food prep, these folks care about the quality of their food. Don't expect bells and whistles when you walk in, this place is old school, but well kept and clean."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! First time was the last time I'll ever go here and wanted to make sure you and no one else waste 10 bucks on there awful food. Asked for a meat and cheese steak no onions. Well they decided to make sure I would never come back by servings me one full of onions. How hard is it to listen to the customer after I gave you a 2 dollar tip?! Don't make the sandwich you want make the sandwich the customer wants. Never do I write reviews and felt the need to share my story of how lazy this company is. Don't eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I spent 35$ for two 8in Philly's and one 12inch 3 drinks and one large fry I will never go back a young female worker had a dirty and stained work shirt the guy cooking looks and acts like a mean dude meat is frozen when the cook it the soda fountain taste like its never been clean my lady did not like her cheese steak I mean its okay but there's nothing special and for 35$ it better taste good but it tastes alight stomach ache afterward"}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks made however you want them.   Friendly service too.    One of the best in arizona."}
{"text":"4 months later and it's still my #1 go to spot! I drive out of my way to go here at least once a week but I have been there 4 times in one week! Delicious every time. Service would put any establishment to shame! There is no hit or miss here it's always square on!"}
{"text":"In line with the best cheesesteaks in Phoenix Metro. About the standard wait time for a made-to-order place, mine was 7min. They'll customize is any way you like: onions, peppers, mushrooms, cheeses, etc. Hoagies options too. One of the best parts of being in the place is the constant banter of the two male and two female employees working behind the counter."}
{"text":"A real authentic Philly Cheesesteak sandwich! Great family owned place. Thought I was in PA! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Philly steak and cheese I've had. Amazing owners that were very friendly and treat the customers like family. Had an amazing red sause, must put in your Philly!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Just like the cheese steaks you'd get back east. The people working there are always friendly and welcoming. Can't think of a single criticism"}
{"text":"We always love this place for a tasty and hefty lunch.  I prefer my cheese steak \"hoagie style\" with onions and red sauce.  The wife likes the mushroom cheese steak.  They make your sandwich up to order right in front of you, and it comes hot off of the grill.  The rolls are perfect, and there's lots of hot sauce available if you want to spice it up.  We've been wanting to try a hoagie, but the cheese steaks always win out!"}
{"text":"Was really exited to eat here due to so many positive reviews. Sadly the food came up extremely short of my expectations. I wouldn't recommend unless you are in the mood for an overpriced not so good cheese steak. Overall I would have to say stay away save your money there is definitely better out there. Also being from the land of the cheese steak I can honestly say this does not come close to a true Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed after driving up from Tucson.  When I walked in the front door there  any was a fool pounding on the grille with his spatula.  My first concern was am I going to be eating fine pieces of metal that might break off.  The pounding was so loud that the girl taking the order right in front of me had difficulty hearing what I was ordering.  I ordered a cheese steak with onions and whiz.  The whiz over took the flavor of the meat and I could barely taste any onions.  The meat in the sandwich was minced real fine and with the whiz mixed in, my wife made a remark that it looked like one of our dogs had thrown up.  I certainly would not recommend this restaurant for cheese steak sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just dropped $45.00 on the Belly Filler, Buffalo Chicken, and Italian sub with a side order of fries, salad, and chicken nuggets. Cooks and hostest seemed nice.  The cooks daughter was the host, and was heard arguing with her parents, no real class or customer service here.    First, the Belly Filler has ZERO flavor.  Plain and simple, and best word to describe it is \"bland and boring\".  Had to add my own red sauce from the fridge just to make it edible,  The buffalo chicken is nothing special either.  They say \"house special sauce\" but also bland with little flavor.  The Italian same thing.  13 year old daughter took a few bites; not impressed.  The salad is iceberg with roma tomato.  The chicken nugget were exactly microwave frozen nuggets.  I think freezer nuggets beat these any day of the week.  3 year old nibbled on one of them and tossed the rest.  My advice is to stay away, far, far, away. I personally feel ripped off and want my money back.  No clue how this place has so much positive reviews.  Take your money to Oregano's."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I had the Philly cheese steak...of coarse. Very filling, tasted awesome and the couple that run the place are very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!   I pass by this place often and finally stopped in to pick up something to bring home for dinner. I ordered the meatball sandwich. Very good meatballs, tasted homemade to me.  I ordered a cheesesteak with jalapeños for my husband. He really liked it. Good and spicy, he said."}
{"text":"I love this place.   After living in the Philly area for a couple of years you can come to appreciate the way these sandwiches taste.    Yes, they push the cheese steaks, and they are pretty good.   To me they are a bit light on the meat but tasty.   My 2 favorite sandwiches in the place are the Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steaks and the Italian Hoagie.      First, let me tell you bout the buffalo chicken cheese steak.  It is a good sized portion of spicy chicken in a sandwich with cheese.  It is beyond tasty.   It is outstanding!    The Italian Hoagie is tremendous.   They pack this sandwich with meat, and it is truly the same taste that you can get in any Philly Deli.   Not an easy task to emmulate this here in AZ as many other east coasters can attest to.     The place is  a small mom and pop deal.  People are friendly and it appears that many of the staff are family members.   You can always count on a warm friendly greeting and a smile.     Great food, friendly staff.   What is not to like?"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great find. You'd never guess this joint tucked in an old shopping center was putting out the tasty quality sandwiches like they are. Seems to be family run, everyone was real nice. Sandwiches take a bit to make since they are made fresh to order. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Beyond being the best philly cheese steak I have had and being run by an incredible family, I had to share one of the most outstanding displays of customer service that I have ever seen. Found myself asking \"is this real life?\"  There I was stuffing an amazingly soft and tasty cheesesteak (with onions and sauce) when random patron two tables down derp dropped his sammich on the floor. One of the daughters of the owner (I never got her name) swooped in and said \"did you drop it?\".....patron looked up in shame and said yeah.   Best part is within thirty seconds and upon utter insistence he had a new one made at no cost. Patron delivered with an extra large tip. I didn't know places were this caring or on too of it....seriously, this is the customer service and care that grandparents reminisce about.   Keep it up ladies! You are have become a staple on chandler with your excellent food and even better genuine care for everyone who sets foot in your place. One of your daughters told me you all moved from out of state to start a new beginning here.....I hope to be a proud customer for years to come!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Fantastic authentic sandwiches!  Their peppers are so good- both hot and sweet choices. We also had the cream cheese jalapeño poppers. Perfection!  Be sure to order the cheesesteaks with cheese whiz if you have never experienced a real Phillie."}
{"text":"First timers and I have to say, 'delicious'!  My husband and I were greeted w/ a friendly smile and welcome.  Everything was great, service and food.  The bread was so fresh and soft, and the steak was thinly cut and cooked to perfection.  We also tried the seasoned fries, all I can say is YUM!!!!    We'll definitely become regular customers.  If you haven't tried this place, do yourselves a favor and GO, you won't be disappointed.   A simple mom/pop shop with some FANTASTIC Philly Cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"Still the best hoagies and cheesesteaks west of the Schuylkill.  Larry from Philly"}
{"text":"By no means am I philly cheese head expert, but from time to time I crave one enough that a 1 hr drive is a worthwhile trip.   This location defines 'mom and pop' shop, from decor to the children taking orders.  I ordered the 12inch with cheese wiz, grilled onions and bell peppers.. 5 mins later I was left with the thought of what happened? And where did it go? It was that delicious!"}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, delicious cheesesteak hoagie. Definitely close to meeting the expectations of this lady who recently moved from the Philadelphia area, a little light on meat, but otherwise a reasonable substitute to flying out East for a cheese steak fix. Restaurant is quite noisy since the grill is in the dining area separated only by the counter. Staff is friendly and courteous, eager to please. We will be back."}
{"text":"The people there are great.  The cheesesteak is pretty good and Rita is the best sandwich maker.  Her girls are very hard workers and very friendly,, always greet you with a smile and hello.  I go there often and have cashed in on many free cheesesteaks(punchcard).  Only twice have I had minor complaints.  Last time her husband charged me for extra cheese for some reason and all I did was read what was on the cheesesteak from the menu.  It says \"interlaced with lots of melted white American cheese\" and he charged me extra.  Keep him at home.  Forget the fries too,, I hate getting the end of the bag."}
{"text":"What a find! Made my second visit and ordered the pastrami sandwich. YUM I ordered the Philly steak last time with cheese wiz. Both sandwiches were very good. Nice atmosphere and great service.  Have found my Philly sandwich place . T.P."}
{"text":"I am a fan! Love these delicious sandwiches. Always great customer service as well."}
{"text":"This place rocks! So nice to have a mom and pop place that really puts the customer first. Everything is made to order. They know every regular customer by name and order. Food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great, family run place.  Owner is always friendly and answers the phone with my name when I call in a takeout order.  The bellyfiller is a must have!"}
{"text":"Food was good and served up rather quickly. The entire family was there running the operation. It was nice to see staff taking pride in what they do."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in the Valley! The meat was cooked perfect and chopped nice and thin. The bun was fresh and perfectly warmed. Not to mention the creamy american cheese. This family does it right. You know its good when the regulars walk in and the owners know their names. Its a must try. Even the decor is pure Philly! I am planning on a trip back in the near future."}
{"text":"Shame because terrible customer service doesn't make up for the really good food...at least for me."}
{"text":"A East Coaster here Delaware this is the best place to help with a fix for homesickness. The best cheese steaks in AZ. this is as close your going to get.   Very special people own Best of Philly. Rita and Ed who make these great sandwiches. Rita the nicest and the most hard working women I have met here in AZ. and her family that surrounds her. .Good people that make great sandwiches."}
{"text":"this place is great !!!! I called last night to pick up a sandwich on the way home. It was ready at the time promised and the staff was was so friendly when I went in to pick it up. Tasted great & the value and amount of food I got for 10.00 - sandwich, fries, drink and snack was GREAT"}
{"text":"Big phillys, friendly people who treat you like family. They got hoagies so loaded that you cant get you're mouth around. Looks like a hole in the wall but feels like home when you walk in."}
{"text":"It was my first time here today and it was really great! It's a great small little place but the food was so good! And the lady at the front was super nice, she recommended the seasoned fries and they were very good. I got the original Philly and it's definitely the best I've had in arizona!"}
{"text":"I read through some of the previous reviews and noticed some comments about less than wonderful customer service. While I agree with the statements I also chalk this up to part of the establishment's character. They are friendly people and seem to try and be helpful. (I think I can guess which one made the comment about being able to count and I've just gotten use to him occasionally saying something that just seems a bit odd to me.)  It seems to be a family run business and what we use to call a hole in the wall. Nothing fancy with the decor, seating, or service, but the food is well worth it. This reminds me of some of the small grinder shops I frequented a few decades ago, back in Connecticut. My husband and I both love the Philly cheesesteaks here, especially with the red sauce.. it really enhances the flavor. It's good food at a good price. If the character and atmosphere aren't to your liking, it also is a good place to get take out."}
{"text":"I was driving around the area the other day and I have been meaning to try this place so I stopped in. The girl running the register and the dude behind the grill were both really laid back. I got a cheesesteak with wiz and an original philly hoagie to go.  I havent had too many cheesesteaks in my life but this sandwich was both cheesy and steaky and I felt slightly guilty eating it, so I guess that makes it awesome. The original philly was a standard sub, fresher than most places but I wouldnt go out of my way for it alone. I had no idea what red sauce was when I walked in. I guess it's a tomato based gravy, they do it really well but I can do without it. If I were craving cheesesteaks on a weekly basis, I'd work this into the rotation with Defalcos.   Also, prices are very good for the quality you get."}
{"text":"I went here looking for a TRUE philly cheese steak, I don't feel they have accomplished it. Their \"cheese whiz\" was not really cheese whiz. The red sauce they put on the sandwiches is not bad.  Definitely not world's best as advertised, but good all the same."}
{"text":"John E.  Being a Southeast Pennsylvania  native and eating at most of the great Philly Cheesesteak places in the area, including Pat's and Genos I was leary of the rave  reviews for Philly's Famous but was not disappointed when we ate there today.  My Wife and I both had the Pepper Mushroom Cheesesteak wit onions, red sauce and Whiz. THE BOMB!!  Lots of meat, sweet peppers, mushrooms, sauteed onions, Whiz and they use Amoroso Rolls from Philly, which is a must for any great Philly Cheesesteak or Hoagie.  Great friendly Service and lots of Patrons for 4 o'clock on a Saturday Afternoon.  We will come back the next time we are in the Phoenix Area. Have to try their Italian Hoagie to see how it compares to those back East."}
{"text":"Best Philly I've had in Phoenix. Good people behind the counter."}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona since 1984 and have never found a cheesesteak or hoagie as authentic as Philly's famous!  I'm here at least once a month! Megan and her family always make me feel welcomed and truly appreciate their customers! Went to a new place in mesa today and it was supposedly authentic and I was not impressed!  Didn't even have sweet peppers!! I'll keep making the drive to get a real cheesesteak or hoagie!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested I try this because he had been there and loved it! Absolutely delicious...real cooking and very friendly family. If your looking for a real Philly cheesesteak look no further!"}
{"text":"One of the best cheesesteaks I've had. The bread was soft but not soggy and they didn't overdo it with the cheese."}
{"text":"Tender steak with onions and lots of cheese! I didn't get my side of red sauce but it was still delicious, soft bread and not dry!"}
{"text":"Really tastey! Great portions. The owners are so welcoming. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Amazing owners who truly have a passion for their customers and food. They treated my family and I like old family friends. Absolutely terrific experience and outstanding food. No doubt the best Philly cheesesteaks in AZ. Can't wait to go back. Thank you to the great chef and family owners."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer care. Really loved meeting the staff members, they are wonderful people. I definitely recommend this place especially if you're craving Philly cheese steak! Also, they make you feel at home with their generosity and kindness."}
{"text":"We LOVE this family owned & energized restaurant.   We have lived in Chandler for 9 years and the only time we would eat a Philly cheesesteak is when we traveled to Philly.  So happy to have found this delicious place.  I loved the family feel, the energy, and the support they give one another to be successful.  Support local!!    We will be back!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST!! Perfect cheesesteaks-every time. Soft bread, tender meat & the red sauce and cheese make a perfect creamy delicious sandwich. Add hot peppers, onions and mushrooms!! Yum:)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service disorganized meat was dry I can make it better to stick at home however the bread was excellent"}
{"text":"Definitely curbed my craving for the real thing...awesome steak! I was hesitant about the red sauce...don't be!"}
{"text":"This might be the friendliest staff around.  I don't know why or how they make the best Philly around but they do.  Food is made to order so you will have to wait on it.  The price for a 12\" seems high to me but I pay it anyway and just do not go often.  My friends from Philadelphia approve and we are regulars."}
{"text":"The best philly cheese steak in Arizona hands down. The brother and sister owners are very genuine. Will definitely be going back soon for more."}
{"text":"I love this place. Staff is very friendly. Run by family.... If you happen to be in chandler and wants some philly steak. This is spot. I always drive 30min jus for some good philly"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Food is consistently good."}
{"text":"\"She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.\"  -Han Solo  Born and raised just outside of Philly, I get personally offended when I see a menu offering up \"Philly Chesesteaks,\" when clearly they've never even seen one. Call it a steak sandwich all you want, but put \"Philly\" in front of it, and we expect - nay, DEMAND - something very specific. And 99/100 joints get it dead wrong.  This place is LEGIT. From the outside, or upon entering, it may not look like much, but then you hear the clatter of the spatulas on the flattop cooking up that meat wit onions, and you already know you're on the right track.   Displaced Philadelphian? Come here and get your fix, you won't be disappointed. The red sauce is reminiscent of places farther north like Allentown and Bethlehem, but you can order the steaks without it.   When I miss the food from back east, this is where I come."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service , and great tasting sandwiches, I'll be back with the family , I'm happy I checked this spot out , I love ke family owned business."}
{"text":"The best go to cheesesteak in Arizona!!   Coming from East coast, we have been looking for a good cheesesteak for years! Good thing we saw them on yelp, we tried them, and YES! We've been going here since! We always get their mushroom cheesesteak. True as they say on their logo, just like in Philly! Philly's Famous, thank you! Just like home!"}
{"text":"Glory hole. This place is deliciously messy with Philly memorabilia exploding off the walls, pictures of the pope and family haphazardly taped up near the cashier area and open kitchen grill, hand written specials scrawled on a white board, very excitable (and very friendly) owners shouting at each other in some crazy mixed language.....it's perfect.   I had the 8-inch with onions and Wiz, and some fries. The Fries could have been better but the sandwich was first rate. Chewy roll, super tender beef, not stringy at all. Loved it.   There is a decent sized Sammy menu with all sorts of options so I am excited to visit again soon to check those out.   If you are feeling the need for some old schoolEast coast cheese steaks eats in Chandler, look no further imo."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has solid 4 to 4.5 star food. They make, without doubt, the best Philly I've had east of the Mississippi. And they make it any way your heart desires. My sandwich fave is the Italian Philly. I get it with extra grilled onions and mayo, hold the red sauce. Their french fries are also really tasty. Everything is hot and fresh.  So if the food is 4 to 4.5, why the five star review? The staff, flat out. Everyone who works there is family and they seem to think I'm family too. Now we all have dark hair and a somewhat swarthy complexion but I don't remember any of these people at the Thanksgivings of my childhood. Doesn't matter. They treat all their customers as if they're family, and like they're family that's actually loved and missed.  If you have the opportunity, try a Philly at Philly's Famous. If you're a Philly fan you'll be really glad you did. Oh, and don't be surprised to pick up some new relatives along the way."}
{"text":"This looks like no big deal from the out side, but then you bite into the sandwich! I am a firm believer in not judging a book by it's cover and this is a perfect example! The food here is so good and the service is fantastic. The older daughter of the owner  and the owner are the sweetest women I've met in Arizona! When I walk in, I feel like I am always greeted so warmly and they are always so kind.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone from the east coast looking for a bite of home, or anyone who respects and appreciates great food!!  My one suggestion, preorder your food. It can get super busy in there at times!"}
{"text":"This is becoming a regular lunch place for me. Their Italian subs are spot on and I've never had a more 'real Philly' cheesesteak. Family business by some great people. Come on in, have a sandwich... and you're family, that's the way they are. Loving it."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to 'Philly's Famous'. My experience was so incredible, I had to get on yelp to share. Mark (the owner) took my order. I asked for an 8\" turkey hoagie for my wife, and I told Mark that I'd like to try whatever sandwich is his favorite. He asked me if I liked \"spicy\" and I said yes. He then wrote down the order ( 12\" Jack pepper cheese steak with hot pepper) and turned it over to Rita (his wife of 20 years). While Eddie (Rita's brother) prepared the steak, (and while Mark and I were talking about travel, food, and small businesses in the area), Rita handed me a slice of fresh rolled turkey for me to taste so that I would know how good it was, showed me how soft and fresh the bread was, and even let me taste a french fry before she bagged them up. She takes noticeable pride in putting out a quality product. I ordered the food to go and Mark put the drinks in a holder, Rita bagged up the sandwiches and fries, and (as my hands were full with the cup holder and drinks) Mark carried the sandwiches out to my truck. I was already a fan of 'Philly's Famous' before I took a bite of my sandwich!  I had to drop off my wife's food at her work because she couldn't get away. She just sent me a text that said \"Delicious! So good!!! Goodbye Jimmy Johns!!!\"  It's funny because I thought the same thing as I tasted my sandwich. The bread is incredibly soft (but firm enough on the outside as not to get soggy). The meat is impossible to properly describe. It was tender, free of fat, and flavored to perfection! The pepper jack cheese was melted perfectly throughout the center of the meat, and the peppers definitely gave it the kick that I love. I had planned on eating half of my sandwich for lunch and the other half for dinner, but I ended up eating the whole thing. There is something about the fries that give them that small town feel. Rita put a little salt and pepper on them for me and they were great. As I write this, my 16 year old daughter took off with what was left of them. I'm so happy to have found an amazing sandwich shop in my neighborhood. Even more so that I get to have lovely conversation with Mark and Rita. I highly recommend 'Philly's Famous' and I suggest that you get to know the family that runs it as well. They are gracious, caring, and as friendly as it gets. Thank you Mark, Rita, and Eddie! See you all next time!!!"}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH EVER !!  Not just because of the food but because of the family who made it.  I've been coming here for 5 years. Small family owned place authentic back east food. A big guy from Chicago knows how to eat.  I've watched the kids grow up in this place working the register.   Beautiful daughters and the son become a young man. They have a passion for food and you'll feel like ur back east they way they all communicate loud and full of life.   I was saddened to hear the business was not doing well thru the summer and that the family business is supporting a large family in our community.  Please revisit this place if you're in need of some American comfort food.  Everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Was in the area and was super hungry. Found Philly's famous on yelp and gave it a shot. I order the buffalo chicken and it was the bomb. So juicy so hot and just amazing. The place is small and was hopping. The employees were super nice and welcoming. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  It was not terrible but it was not amazing.  A bit too salty for my taste.  The girls that work there are really sweet.  They were really busy so maybe I just got a sandwich a bit over seasoned.  I will give it another try.....but I have had better."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe this place has been here for over 5 yrs and I just found it!! Great friendly service, family owned, delicious food. I love how the cook suggested the worcestershire sauce and she was on the spot. I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"ORDER AHEAD OF TIME..... first time there today and the wait was long. Great sandwich and would recommend order to go."}
{"text":"Phillies famous is an amazing place to go if you really like cheesesteaks you're gonna love this place give it a try you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time because we read about it in a magazine and fell in love! We took both of our parents here when we moved here and they loved it! The place is always busy, the staff is so friendly & funny, and the food is absolutely perfect! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went in today to get lunch at this place. I walked in and stood there waiting to be acknowledged...not happening. There were several employees that saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. I stood there for approximately two minutes waiting and I turned around and left. No smile, no welcome to Philly's Famous just a blank stare and a conscious avoidance. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is as close to Philly as you can get!   The cheese streaks are freshly made when you order.  The staff is so personable that you want to come back."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Our new place for Philly Cheese Steaks! Great family business, I feel good about supporting their business. Plus they treat you like part of the family! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place will breath life into what may seem like an uneventful day.  I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. The food is amazing but the family operated business has some of the customer service I have ever experience. This place is a must try for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years, but hadn't been in for awhile.   Still a great cheesesteak!!! Great staff that treats people right.  It won't be long before I'm back again."}
{"text":"My sandwich was very good.  The bread was fresh.  The ingredients were both plentiful and good quality.  I had the original hoagie-- a cold sandwich with so much meat and cheese, lettuce, tomato on it that I couldn't find a way to get the thing in my mouth for a decent bite.  Even the 8 inch is a beast you have to see to believe.  I had to nibble at it like a squirrel, and probably looked the part cramming this sandwich in my face with gusto that my mouth couldn't really keep up with.  I took half to work for later.  If you like a real sandwich (I mean a REAL sandwich, not that crap Subway continues to successfully market on a sheeplike public.  How is Subway even still in business?) Anyway, I digress.  If you're feeling the urge for an old school, Philly style sandwich, this is your go to in the east valley.  Its clean, friendly, and family run.  There's really nothing to gripe about here, unless you show up on a Sunday with a total craving for an awesome sandwich.  They're closed on Sunday.  That's the only time you'll be disappointed.  I'm looking forward to trying the cheese steak sandwiches, as this is their specialty.  Will update when that happens.  In the mean time, don't wait on me! Go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"If you know what you want, and it's a Philly Cheestake, this is going to check the box BOLDLY.  I have been here a half dozen times.  Good food, great people.  The service is sincere and helpful.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good cheesesteaks. Been back twice so far. Really nice owners that are trying their best but lacking in organization. That's the only star I took off for this review.  Bread.....amazing! Cheesesteak meat and prep.......delicious! I'd only recommend more meat if possible (maybe I'll try asking for double meat next time and see what they say). I shall be returning, no doubt."}
{"text":"The bus from Philly came and stopped right here at Philly's Famous. Quite possibly the best Cheesesteaks in the valley. Worth finding this little spot in a strip mall, especially if you haven't had breakfast as they will fill you up. I haven't had a sandwich that has been bad here yet. Just be prepared though, others do know about this spot and sometimes you are going to have to wait a bit to get your food, but it's worth it, so go find this place when you aren't rushed for lunch and maybe when you have some time to nap after."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for lunch in the area. Found this great little gem. I have never been to Philadelphia but if this how a Philly cheese steak sandwich is supposed to be, I have to take a cross country trip. But is nice to know I don't have to if I want a awesome sandwich."}
{"text":"Beautiful people very friendly and of course food was great best subs I have ever had ..  I drop 25mils to just eat here .."}
{"text":"Holy cow this food was amazing and the staff are awesome made me food even though they was closed best cheesesteak ever"}
{"text":"11/15/13  This location never gets old!!!  Always remember the \"wiz\"!!!  Makes a great start to the weekend."}
{"text":"This former South Jersey girl LOVES this friendly, awesome little sandwich shop.  True Philly Cheesesteaks (with wiz, please) that are delicious and on the tastiest bread.  Perfect meat-cheese-bread ratio.  Staff is super friendly.  Sure, sometimes it takes a little while.  But Philly Cheesesteak perfection is worth it."}
{"text":"When we showed up a little girl (maybe 9) took our order. Which was fine. And then she called to her parents because we couldn't pay without them. They told us to wait.  So we waited.  We sat down. As the owners sat and ate. While we sat there...no one making food ..........not like I was hungry or anything ! And I was on my way to work. Just waiting. Finally came and took payment and this is after 10 minutes of waiting. While they are sitting behind us........ then the sandwiches started......  So NO I don't have time to sit and wait while you take your 30 min break and let customers sit while you eat right behind me.  I'm hungry too. If you're going to run a business at least have someone working while you are not and not have us waiting for a sandwich while your 9 year old daughter takes orders for people. Never be back. Sandwich sucked anyway."}
{"text":"Wow. Tried to go there for the first time tonight. Heard good things. Walked in about 30 minutes before close and was rudely rushed out immediately because they \"ran out of bread\". What kind of SANDWICH shop doesn't keep bread stocked? Keep in mind this was Valentine's Day and they were all wanting to get out of there. I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a great little spot to get a yummy cheesesteak! It's worth it just to come here for the super nice people that work here. This place has a friendly atmosphere that's lacking in most restaurants. I got a cheesesteak with cheese whiz and it was very good! I'll definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Maybe the nicest people and the nicest family-owned restaurant I've been to in a long time. And the Philly cheese steak is excellent, too!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better cheesesteaks I have had recently in the Valley.  I have not deviated from the original combo (original cheesesteak, fries, and a drink) from the 3 times that I have gone.  That means I enjoyed it.  They sell Wise chips also.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am very excited to have found this place! I have been looking for a good steak n cheese place for a long time and the search is over! I have been 3 times in last couple weeks. I ordered the Pepper Steak with regular and hot peppers and extra cheese with no red sauce. The bread is great and they have Ginger Ale on the fountain. Dont see that too often.  This is a family owned shop and the family is super nice and friendly. If you are looking for a great cheesesteak in the East Valley, check this place out!"}
{"text":"My family goes to Philly's Famous every Saturday.  The family that owns and runs the shop are truly the salt of earth.  My family and I love them.  Mark, Eddie, Rita and Jacob are awesome.  They make the best sandwiches around.  Weather it's a Cheesesteak (go Eddie!!!) or an Italian (go Rita!!!), you'll get nothing but the best food and it's be served with love from a lovely family.  God bless you!  -Pete"}
{"text":"Eddie and Rita will make you feel at home while they cook up your fave steak or hoagie on those famous Amoroso rolls!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand what the big deal is about Amaroso roles.  The only thing that separates this sandwich from the the best tasting thing ever is the the tasteless, air filled, famous filler that tastes like nothing. Any good sandwich starts with good bread. It's the only thing keeping this sandwich from being undeniable. If this bread is famous than I  just don't get it."}
{"text":"Give your typical day a rating from 1 to 10 (10 being the highest of course). Then eat the Original Philly Sandwich from Philly's Famous. Your day is now a 10! These sandwiches are so tasty, it's unbelievable. I visited Philadelphia about 12 years ago and have been looking for a sandwich to match what I had eaten there. Well it's here and waiting for you in Chandler. Northwest corner of Alma School and Ray.  Try it out and you will be back. Tell and bring friends to support this local and very tasty business.  Here's to my next 10 day!"}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheesesteak in Arizona!  Their hoagies are awesome too!  The family and friends that work there are super friendly and generous.  This place is easy to miss as it is in a strip mall. It is a great find.  Once you try it you will return."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat, we've been here quite a few times, wish I'd known about it sooner. Food is great and so is the service."}
{"text":"So my wife and I really like the cheese steaks, but the people behind the counter are horrible.   It is definitely a family business since one or two of the people behind the counter are teenagers.  To top it off, there always seems to be a loud family \"discussion\" (fight) everyone we are waiting.  Waiting and waiting and waiting.... really slow service."}
{"text":"My wife works nearby and they go here for lunch a lot.  She tells me at lunch time they are usually packed.   I always get her leftover sandwich which I found quite tasty. Tonight we were in the neighborhood and decided to stop by.  I finally got a hot, fresh cheese steak from them instead of leftovers! Awesome sandwich.  They have a 12 or 8 inch.  I got the 8 inch sandwich and was stuffed.  Very good cheese steak.  One of the best that I have ever had.  Mine had grilled onions and mushrooms.  The people running the place are so nice and welcoming.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"First time customer and now forever customer... tasted like I was back home. Ordered the original philly with wiz.... brought me back home after the first bite... The service was awesome, very friendly. Great experience ever!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Everyone is always happy to see you. This is my go to philly shop."}
{"text":"We are from NJ, and frequently go to Pat's in Philly for the one of a kind Philly that we thought we couldn't get anywhere else.  Living in Arizona, we thought we had to give it up for good, but then we found Philly's Famous!  Not much to look at, but the food is just like Pat's.  Actually, I think it's better because you can actually sit inside and I kid you not...they actually taste better!  This is a small family owned business...I hope Obama doesn't screw this up too...but for now, I just love eating here!  The owners are adorable and sweet and it reminds me of back home!   Best Philly Cheese steaks anywhere!   Their hoagies are to die for too!  You'll have to make a few trips...then you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Phirst timer at Philly's Phamous Cheesesteaks. Phamily runned. You can tell they love what they do. Super, Super friendly. I hope I dont mess up names but Im going to go by names I heard others saying. Rita is so nice. She puts a smile on your face. Eddie the grill master was making those spatulas sing while folding in the meats, peppers and onions. Rita showed me my sandwich as she put it in the wrapping paper and bag. Eddie did the same making the cheese steak, hoagie style, look picture perfect. Rita knew I was a new guest and gave me one of their specialty desserts gratis for driving 53 minutes from Laveen. Almost everyone that came in was greeted by name. That is awesome. The \"Cheers\" factor.  I ordered the Cheesesteak with Red Sauce, onions, hoagie style. Frikin Awesome Cheesesteak. Best in Arizona. Spices, meat, cheese and bread all melted in your mouth. Worth the drive. Also ordered the Italian Hoagie. Perfectly put together and spiced just right. No Wimpy sandwiches here. Place was very clean too. This is the Real Philly Experience.  Chef John gives ,  Very satisfied. Will be back soon. Keep up the Great work."}
{"text":"I gave the owner Eddie a hug.  If you are from Philadelphia you will be ecstatic!! The Amoroso's rolls, the rib eye steak, the authentic white American cheese! This was our first visit and we drove 45 minutes to get here and plan on doing this often! Lovely family business too!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The definition of locally owned. It's my 1st time here and I went with the cheese steak. Was amazing!! You could taste everything the meat, cheese, onions, and red sauce. I can't wait to come back and try all the different items on the menu. The season fries are also so good! If you're thinking of coming here stop thinking and do it!!"}
{"text":"Great steak, good service. Seasoned fries are awesome and best straight  Philly I've had here. Love the family, too. :)"}
{"text":"Been on a Philly cheesesteak kick for the last couple of days. Saw another review about this place on yelp and decided to check it out.   Pretty much spot on. The sandwich I got was the Philly cheesesteak with peppers and mushrooms. Cheesy and yummy. The owners were very friendly and joking around with the regulars. Looks like this place has been around a while. Mighty good sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Haven't found a better cheesesteak in Arizona (although I stopped looking when I found Philly's famous).  Everyone is very friendly and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Everything was fresh and hot. The philly had a perfect ratio of meat, cheese and veggies.  If you want real Philly, you will not need to go far. Nothing beats a small owner shop type service. Authentic sandwich. You will not be. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was a good cheesesteak for regular people, but since they don't use ribeye, it can never be classified as a great sandwich.    Steak - wafer thin as advertised, probably sirloin to save money. If you fly all the other ingredients into PHX from Philly, why not go the extra mile with the meat. Chips - the bag of sour cream and onion chips from a new company, very crunchy. Red sauce - got it on side, marinara basically. It helps, but I don't know what part of Philly puts red sauce on steak. Maybe this was an Italian version cause it doesn't happen in a real cheesesteak.  Better to call ahead I suppose. The cook just makes one order at a time. Either get a bigger grill or use two cooks to speed up process.  The best Valley Cheesesteak is at casey's Grill."}
{"text":"Wow and authentic cheesesteaks like I've experiencd in Philly.  A nicely found spot for me. I fully expect to be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived 5 minutes from this place for 2 years and never came.  I have been missing out big time. This was the best Philly I have ever had!  Great service and even greater food. Trust me you will not be disappointed when/if you come. OMG!!!! Yummy :-)"}
{"text":"Been here three times and I have to say...yummy! Family run and a great place to get a cheese steak. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Damn, i love this place so much! Best Cheese Steaks around. And btw, u literally feel you are in Philly"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been a customer for 6 years now. If your having a bad day the positive attitude in this place will turn your day around. I moved to Gilbert and forgot about this place. I happened to be by this place getting my truck fixed at another local shop. As soon as I went in after not being there for 3 years they remembered me/my order/ and that I love there ranch. For the past few months I have returned multiple times. Thanks for coming back into my life. :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better steak sandwiches in the area!  Serious Philly fans.  All sorts of historic memorabilia in this place.  Like all good joints from the east they had tasty cakes!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have a word to describe how delicious their cheesesteaks are. My fiancé and I tried it for the first time tonight based on Yelp reviews, and we were definitely not disappointed. Upon walking in, we were greeted by nothing but smiles. They recommended to us the Philly Cheese Steak (with american cheese) with the red sauce and onions. Watching it being made on the grill is fascinating and gives your mouth a chance to water before savoring the upcoming meal.  100% recommended. You will not be disappointed. Return customer for sure!"}
{"text":"An okay cheesesteak , definitely not the \"Worlds Best\" as the sign says. I think next time I will try a hoagie. I've had the Cheesesteaks with gravy (red sauce) which they recommend and it was pretty good. I'm really a Cheez Whiz fan and they did offer it the 2nd time I visited but it didn't taste as good as others I've had. Not sure it was even real Cheez Whiz or just hard to tell cause they didn't put much on. I like it smothered! Not as good as the ones they have at the Suns games.   Overall , they were very friendly so I will go back because it's close by. Also nice pics of historical Philadelphia buildings on the walls. I agree with the other reviewer. Probably \"best cheesesteak at Alma School and Ray\" would be a more appropriate sign."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! We love the family !! I had my sons birthday catered and the food is the best!! Service outstanding !!!"}
{"text":"Great food in this small style shop. I'm not from Philly but I am from back East (New England) and the ham hoagie special today brought me back to the old school \"grinder\" that I grew up loving. Thanks Philly's Famous for bringing back my childhood!  I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Philly cheese steak and Italian hoagie sandwiches. Family owned and great service. They also have Philadelphia water ice. The cherry favor is my go to. Located on Alma School. Be sure to stop here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time there just passing by decided I'd lunch at phillys famous, worker or owners treated me extremely nice I thought I was at my owy family home :) and the food was very good HIGHLY Recommend ....... definitely be back... Thanks mark...  ( eddie )"}
{"text":"Good Cheesesteak I thought it was a little overpriced it wasn't the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good cheesesteak so I went to Yelp hoping to find one like I would get in Pennsylvania.  I instantly became a fan the first time I visited.  So much so that I had to come back 2 days later!  It's like being back in Pennsylvania! I'm looking forward to going back to see if the hoagie is as good as the cheesesteak.  The staff (I think it's family owned)  is fun and hilarious!  They appear to have good relationships with their regular customers."}
{"text":"Not only was the food delicious but the customer service was amazing! Super nice people and overall a \"homey\" feeling when you walk in. You can tell there are many regulars that come in and enjoy the food! The Philly was delicious. We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a place that makes awesome phillys. We have finally found this place. Been there three times so far and are returning customers. No complaints at all from us. The bellyfiller is a must try."}
{"text":"My son & I split the 8' cheesesteak with grilled onions & provolone. Super filling & delicious. Hubby had the pepper steak and liked loved it. What stands out most of all was the amazing, fast & friendly customer service. We will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, Rita is the best, and makes a killer hoagie!! No matter what sandwich I get, it's always perfect.  I usually order take out and never have to wait very long.  Thank you for keeping it consistent and always delicious!!"}
{"text":"Really friendly employees and delicious cheesesteaks will keep me coming back, but definitely at off peak times.  We ate there for the first time today and it was so crowded and noisy.  When they were clacking those spatulas on the grill to chop the meat I thought my head was going to explode.  I don't expect the library by any means, but the grill is right out in the dining area and that loud repetitive metal on metal was just too much for me.  There were times we couldn't even carry on a conversation.  If I'm going to be somewhere that loud, there better be some booze available.  We took one of the two-tops just over the wall from the ordering line, and there was some broad next to us with her legs crossed, one of those drumsticks hanging out where people were trying to walk, oblivious.  I got bumped into several times while people tried to avoid her taking up almost the entire space between tables.  She should have hidden those gnarly toes anyway.    Walking through that door I truly felt like I had stepped out to the East Coast.  Philly décor all over the walls.  Every time I see a picture of Chase Utley I always think of the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode when the gang goes to Atlantic City.  One of the best.    No!  YES!!   You have to see it if you haven't.  Hilarious.  Season 6.  Episode 11.    There were several people waiting for a table when our sandwiches were ready, so we just took them to go and hit up a nearby park to enjoy the weather.  The cheesesteaks were absolutely the best I've had in a long time.  Delicious, tender, well-seasoned meat with a super soft, fresh hoagie roll.  We didn't get the fries this time, but when we were in the restaurant I saw some walk by and they looked good as well.  No pics this time, but we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been a customer here for a couple of years and have never had a bad experience. The food is delicious and fresh, always made to order. It gets busy so we like to call our order in for pick up, otherwise it can be a long wait. The actual restaurant is small with limited seating, but worth the trip anyway. The staff are friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Went to pick up lunch for my husband and I based on living Chandler recommendations.  So Not disappointed!  The owner was super nice, we split a philly that was huge and delicious. The owner suggested the hot sauce, not spicy but delicious.  We will be repeat customers for sure. Go you will be happy you did -quality for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been to both Pat's and Geno's in Philly and this place is as close to authentic as it gets in AZ. They are family owned and have been around for some time. It's always busy here and popular with the locals. The cheese steaks are phenomenal and the prices are great. I always order mine whiz wit (with cheese whiz, \"wit\" onions). It's fun to look at all the pictures and news clippings from Philadelphia hanging on the wall while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!!  Food is excellent, as is the service."}
{"text":"My husband LOVES Philly Cheesesteaks, and this is by far his favorite place in the valley to get them.  We don't live in Chandler anymore, but when we're nearby we try to stop by for some good eats.  He asked to go there for Father's Day this weekend, and we are all excited to go back!!  Super friendly service, yummy food, super-casual family dining - we love it at Philly's Famous!!!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back the Philly Cheese Steak was so good!  The service was really good too a family owned gem!"}
{"text":"Another visit, having moved away years ago. The food is still excellent, Rita is still charming but Joey moved on. Still slow but if there's no line, definitely worth the wait.   The menu says: \"Everything is made to order, well worth waiting for.\"  I concur."}
{"text":"After getting attacked by the ice machine ($h*t happens) I was welcomed to an Amazing 12\" steak Philly loaded with awesome. I recently moved to the area and had been searching for a sammich shop that could tame my fat kid hunger... And I found it. No pictures cause I inhaled that beast of a sammich"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks in the east valley at least, awesome place."}
{"text":"Excellent & authentic cheesesteak! I love how they mix the extra toppings into the steak.  The bread is soft & yummy! Gotta get the wiz on it!"}
{"text":"Place looks like it was transplanted from Philly, sandwich was phenomenal, bread nice and soft, meat and spices was perfect, i've never been to Philly to say I've had an original Philly sandwich but I would have to say this would be close"}
{"text":"Items Ordered:  Usually a 12\" Cheese Steak and an 8\" Mushroom Steak + a drink  Total Bill:  Around $20  Satisfaction Level: They keep us coming back.  Quick Tips:   - Make sure you get the red sauce.  This is the definition of a family owned, mom and pop store.  They always remember us when we go in and are very friendly.  And true to form, they are very reminiscent of an East Coast steak shop, right down to the Tastey Kakes available at checkout.  The only complaint is that they regularly forget or run our of red sauce, hence the 4 stars.  The red sauce is key!  Make sure you get it!"}
{"text":"The place is family run by a philly bread family and everyone is really nice. The sandwiches are (reportedly) true Philliy cheesesteaks but if you want your whiz on top, you need to ask, otherwise you'll get cheddar.   As previously noted by other reviewers, it can get loud with the chopping sound. If they ask if you want red sauce, say yes. It's not spicy but adds good flavor to it.   If any former philly friends come to visit, I'll bring them here to see what they think. Pretty sure they'll give a two thumbs up."}
{"text":"You better be hungry when you get here!  The cheesesteaks and hoagies are delicious.  The 12\" Italian Hoagie can easily feed two adults."}
{"text":"I love small, family run businesses.  They do all the little things that make you want to come back. You know, a sincere welcome. None of that screaming stuff like \"Welcome to Fire...se\"   Here, a just a simple: \"Thank you for coming in!\" \"What can I get you.\" \"How's your day?\"    When I stopped here for a late lunch, Mark and his wife were talking to their kids who had just come from school. They were so sweet. Actually his wife was busy cleaning windows to keep the place spiffy. Nice!  I ordered the grilled Italian Sub $8.99 (Provolone, not Cheese Wiz), which came with so much meat, I couldn't believe it was all for one sandwich.  But it was, see photo. It was tasty and had a slightly smokey taste which was nice.    As for the ambience, it too was great. Both husband and wife stopped by to say hello. We had a mutual friend who recommended I come here. They are very sweet, and you'll be happy you came, too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to Philly's Famous for lunch yesterday and look what they made for me. Lots of places in Arizona say that they have authentic Philadelphia Cheese Steaks and hoagies, And when I visit their restaurant they fail to deliver. This place is different. They are the real deal.  Being from Philadelphia I was skeptical, the first time I came here. After I first stumbled across them I was surprised how yummy this was;. Come see for yourself.  Every time I go here and post pics people ask me for their address. Here it is.  1250 N Alma School Rd, Chandler, AZ 85224.  NW corner of Ray and Alma School Roads.  Phone: 480-899-0756  When you visit, tell them Dr. Dave sent you.  :)"}
{"text":"So walking into this place I was a bit nervous but the service was well ok. You can tell this shoo is owned by mom and dad because the kids were coming in talking and going to the back behind the counter. I'm not sure how I feel about that since they deal with food. But overlooking.. I ordered your standard Philly. Which was good. Nothing toooo special but good. This place gets 4 stars for me"}
{"text":"Seriously,  all I have to say is I'M OBSESSED.  I've recently moved to the Chandler area and saw this place down the road from me. I've always been a huge fan of philly cheese steaks, so I had to try this place out. Within the last 2 months, I've probably gone here at least once a week. Best customer service and incredible food!"}
{"text":"I come here about twice a month, I have not found a better Philly steak in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! It's right down the street from us so it's super convenient! The staff are always nice and super friendly. Everyone there is really easy going and the Original Philly Cheesesteak sandwhichs are AWESOME!!!! It's the only thing I ever order because why mess with the best? Prices are very reasonable. Just wish the shopping center they were located in was easier to access. And I wish they delivered! ;)"}
{"text":"The best Phillies sandwiches!! If you go there I recommend the Cheese Philly sandwich, it's amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for philly cheese steaks, hands down. My husband and I found this place driving around when we first moved to Chandler. We usually order half sandwiches with provolone or white American cheese. Food is always high quality and plenty to fill you up. They are family owned and are always so friendly. Support this small business for some good food, and happy tummies :)"}
{"text":"Authentic & delicious! Customer service is exceptional. I highly recommend adding extra veggies and/or extra meat! I had a slight issue during my last visit but they went above and beyond to correct the issue (loud church sermon on tv which killed the ambience) but it was just a misunderstanding and I don't believe it will happen in the future. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Why would a vegetarian think to eat here? There's nothing vegetarian on the menu, but it's convenient to my work, so I called to see if I could get something without meat and cheese and they suggested a Veggie Bellybuster. YUMMYYY!!  Grilled peppers, onions, mushrooms, topped with fresh whatever you want, and even the 8\" size is more than two handsful. The bun was just right. I've been back several times and every sandwich is made with an interest in my taste for the day. The young woman who's been there every time is a jewel, very friendly, and she has every reason to be proud of the food she's serving."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheese steak I have ever eaten. Truly authentic. Place was extremely clean. Owners were friendly and awesome! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Family owned, and the staff is super friendly and really cares about the food they put out.  I moved into this neighborhood 5 yrs ago, and happened to go in my first week after moving in, didn't go back for a couple months because of the holidays crazyness, and they remembered my name!  They have every time since as well, whether I call in, or walk in.  Food is excellent, huge portions, and generous w/the meat.  I swear there is a pound of bacon on their BLT."}
{"text":"Our most favorite place to get the best Philly cheesesteak sandwiches in the valley. Great customer service and always love coming here!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to grab a Philly Cheese Steak, but if you walk in before close but after the time they decide the want to stop serving, then they will refuse service. I walked in tonight at 7:50pm when they close at 8pm and was refused. But had I had called in I would be able to get food. Try having a sign on your door saying that you're not really open til 8pm, you're open until around 7:30pm at which time you won't take any more walk ins. I'm really sad about the customer service since I have referred so many people and brought so many people here during my time here in Chandler. Oh well, on to the next one."}
{"text":"We've been coming for years and this place never disappoints! The Philly cheesesteak is excellent. Ask for it with the spicy sauce. Family owned and operated- and they are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks in the valley! Closest to Philly I've found!"}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly staff with great value. Love this place! My wife's from outside philly and she says its rhe best hoagie she's hab since she moved out!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place for years thinking I should try this one day. Finally did and I'm hooked. Incredible sandwich and service. Glad I finally stopped in.  Try a Philly with shrooms and peppers and extra cheese, oh and onions with red sauce.  FANTASTIC"}
{"text":"I lived in Philly for almost 40 years before moving to Arizona. I do not miss the weather there but I do miss some of the local food such as waterice, soft pretzels, tastykakes, and cheesesteaks.  Fortunately for me, however, I found this friendly little restaurant that really does serve REAL Philly cheesesteaks. I own Hawaiian Experience Spa in Chandler and, as a business owner, spend lots of time at work. That does not leave a lot of time for cooking so I have to find good places to eat. Philly's Famous has become one of my regular lunch spots when working in Chandler.  This is a family owned shop with a friendly staff. The cheesesteaks are consistently excellent. They offer other items but I have never tried any because I just can't pass up the cheesesteak.  I highly recommend trying Philly Steaks if you are looking for a real Philly experience."}
{"text":"First time coming and couldn't be more impressed! I ordered from what could be the owner and he was nothing but great with fantastic customer service. Food was phenomenal and staff was exceptional."}
{"text":"Got a sandwich to go and it was lacking in the meat and asked to have it with mayo and it was just slapped on with way too much."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had. Mind you, I've never been to Philly, But I've had bad versions here and decent ones. This is the best.  I'm writing this review after my 4th visit, and i have not yet been dissappointed.    I'll  start by saying, as a kid my dad took me to a neighborhood place in Tucson that made great cheesesteak, but ever since, i could never find one quite as good. Any restaurant serving a cheesesteak always seemed to be missing a certain flavor, even when properly decked with peppers, onions, mushrooms.   When I came here the first time I was confused by the \"red sauce\" they offered.  A cheesesteak with red sauce?  ( was picturing a marinara smothered sandwich)  The very sweet girl on the cashier explained that it was very light and once cooked in you don't see it. So I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Lo and behold! That was the taste, the missing something that all the other so called cheesesteak sandwiches were lacking. Apparently, some places don't mention that it's in there. It's a sorta, \"secret ingredient\" so if you order your sandwich without it, it may not be quite the same.  The bread was loaded with meat, onions, peppers, mushrooms. The cheese was perfectly melted in.  I swear their idea of 12\" was more like 14\" or longer yet, but who carries a ruler with them.  Even my dad, who is a big eater couldn't finish his whole 12\" and fries.  As for the cheez whiz, to me that is junk that 12 yr olds eat on crackers or squirt right into their mouths being goofy. To me, it has no place in real food.  Even the term \"real cheez whiz\" sounds like an oxymoron.  So I can't give a fair review on their cheez whiz cheesesteaks, other than I'm glad it wasn't on mine!   In short, the food is amazing in taste, quality, and quantity. As for the service? I'd have to go on -- You just won't find that down home friendly, famliy style atmosphere many other places.  Just read Audrey W.'s remarks, and ditto that.   Anyone who says different either caught them on a very rare day, or perhaps has issues of their own. These are solid, darn good people running this place."}
{"text":"Have not been here in awhile, not sure why because they have awesome cheesesteaks. The people who own this place are salt of the earth people! So nice and they make you feel like family. I am from Philly and this place has a local feel to it. Try it out you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First visit, solid win right out of the gate. Small place, easy to miss if you haven't been here before. Wait wasn't terrible, from \"in the door\" to \"eating\" in about 20 min during lunch hours on a Friday. The gentleman and the counter was nice, not like fake nice either, genuinely a good dude that loves his business. The place is family run, as it has been for 10 years apparently. I ordered the cheesesteak with seasoned fries. Tried a side of the red sauce (marinara) and some Buffalo mixed with ranch for dipping. Also grabbed some Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets.   Now, I've never been to Philly, but I imagine this is how it would taste. Soooooooooooo good.  Flavor was on point.  Cheese was good and melted without being overwhelming. Bread was soft and fresh. Fries were tasty and crispy wedges.   Long story short, this place is a BIG recommend from me. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you ever been to Philly and had a cheese steak you got to come here! This is cheese steak at its best! Friendly staff. Feels like family! You got to have wiz!"}
{"text":"This place serves up the best cheese steak sandwich west of the Mississippi. I have lived on the East Coast and would probably admit that their cheese steak is better than anyone I can remember, even in Philly itself (maybe its the bread?).  My absolute favorite sandwich is the \"Bellyfiller.\"  This sandwich is a cheese steak sandwich with everything on it.  A month ago, I ordered about twenty mixed sandwiches from Phlly's Famous.  In that order, five of the twenty were the Bellyfiller.  These sandwiches lasted about 30 seconds before being taken!    The staff is great.  The orders are completed even if they have to make a side sandwich (e.g. veggie) for that special someone.  In addition, to top it off, the serve Wise potato chips.  Now that is worth noting.  The mean price is about $5.50 per 8 inch sandwich.  Come by here, it is worth the experience."}
{"text":"I spent a number of my formative years growing up in the Tri-State area, so I'm afraid I can be something of a snob when it comes to cheesesteaks. It pains me to admit this, because I'm sure I've already painted myself as some sort of cheesesteak-obsessed hipster two sentences into this review - even so, trust me when I say I know what a good cheesesteak is supposed to taste like.   The food here, is without a doubt, sublime. You'll be hard pressed to find a better cheesesteak in Philadelphia, nay, the confines of the Milky Way itself. The meat is tender, the spices are delicious, and the portions are filling. The service is stellar as well - the family who runs the store are some of the sweetest individuals I've ever met, and make it a point to greet me by name every time I walk in.  (Quite the feat, considering how confusing my name is to most people.)  I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Delicious food, very friendly people. Everything made fresh to order; loved the cheesesteak and original. Kids got grilled cheese and a pizza sandwich-YUM! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Philly cheesesteak places I have ever had! I'd recommend the Jack Philly which comes with Jack cheese to give it a little kick and always have them add in the onions. You can make any sandwich a combo with a drink and fries (spring for the seasoned flavor) and still stay under $10 for the 8in sub. You can tell they have regulars and staff seems related, but always friendly and willing to answer questions. I like how they have a deal of the day too!"}
{"text":"Can't get this in Maui  Oh my very good glad this isn't close to me  I would be here everyday  The real deal family run very nice people .. I think I may have to get another one to go..  Love it"}
{"text":"On this trip, I had the Philadelphia Water Ice, and man was it DELICIOUS! Who would have thought something that is fat free, cholesterol free, and dairy free would be so good? I initially thought it was going to taste something like Italian Ice, but it's 10X better, it's smooth and creamy like ice cream, but without a lot of the guilt.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am from Harrisburg, PA, about an hour or so drive from Philly.  This is the absolute closest I have tasted to an actual Philadelphia cheese steak.  My husband and I love this place.  The guys I work with also now love this place.  The workers are friendly and glad you came in.   The steak sandwich - perfect, the bun is great, mine is always steak, muchrooms and cheese.  My husband perfers the works the largest they have.  The fries are great, just as everyone else has said.  I would definately recommend this place to everyone.  Oh, that's right I already have, remember I mentioned my work.  We cant eat here enough."}
{"text":"Very welcoming and personable people, oh and the food is also phenomenal. Don't turn down the red sauce."}
{"text":"My review of Philly's Famous: It's passable. Once again this place is like the other's where the bread is too soft. A good Philly steak should be on a baguette type of roll, where the outside is crusty and the inside is soft and light. They also use Roma tomatoes, probably because they are cheaper, instead of beefsteak tomatoes and what is this red sauce they offer? I see people say that's the way they do it in Philly. Really? The only steak sandwich you get in Philly with red sauce is what they call a pizza steak and it comes with pizza sauce on it. If that's what it is then call it that, not red sauce. I'll give you two tips for a good Philly: #1 most important part is the meat, and #1 is the bread. Yes, you saw correctly, they are both #1. If either of them are subpar then the sandwich is subpar."}
{"text":"I can't believe I left such a short review last time! This is a small mom and pop owned place in a strip mall. They employees are super friendly and they cook the food right behind the counter. The cheese steaks are to DIE for! Just like being in Philly. Sauce, no sauce, wiz, extra wiz, you name it, they'll make it! The interior is small but there are tables chairs and booths to sit in if you don't do take out. This is my go to place for all things cheesesteaks! Will recommend and return!!! I've found my Philly fix!"}
{"text":"The cheese steak sandwiches are the bomb here. The family that runs this place is amazing. Very friendly and warm"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Not just because they are so friendly, the food is amazing, they're quick, they're family owned and operated... As you can see the list can go on and on. I usually pick up food for my whole office from here and order by phone. Recently my Dad and I popped in for a quick bite. Just order the originally Philly cheesesteak, you can't go wrong. Their french fries are good too, always cooked to perfection. So thankful we found this mom and pop place many years ago!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years and decided to stop in for a sandwich. I must say how impressed I was with Philly's Famous compared to other local cheesesteak places. While I normally take my cheesesteak with wiz, I was very excited to see them offer a red sauce as many of my friends from philly claim this is one of the ways they do it back home.   Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, and the sandwich was good. What more could I have asked for?  I'll definitely be remembering Philly's Famous for when I get the craving."}
{"text":"I don't know much about cheese stakes but this place is the bomb dot com... Staff is polite and friendly and food is great.. it also affordable. I like spicy so they offered me their secret habanero cheese steak! it was amazing. The food is fresh and made in front of you. The only negative thing is that they are not open sunday. stop  y this place and try something new it is the best philly cheese steak stop in chandler for sure. Also, i get the red sauce on the side. It is a tomato base however it seems to be better when dipped in to or poured on, if you like how it tastes."}
{"text":"One of the best cheesesteaks you can get in the valley. Family owned and delicious! The owners might be the nicest people I've ever met."}
{"text":"I've been craving a great Philly cheesesteak for months. So I turned to my Yelpers for help and Saturday at 4pm they sent me to Philly's Famous.  To start, this is a neighborhood sandwich shop. The location is easily accessible and unassuming. You walk in and the guy and gal working the shop greet you like an old friend. I'm a sentimental Texan, so that gets me right in the feels every time.  I let the guy give me his recommendation since it was my first visit. The Original Philly Cheesesteak with American cheese and onions and red sauce on the side. Sweet Hosanna, I am in eye rolling heaven. Now, this is nothing against red sauce fanatics, but this meat is so juicy and tender the sauce is not necessary. It is really good sauce, spicy, sweet and thin. I dipped my sandwich in it and it was good, but I'm a fan of the cheesesteak as is.   Of note, the seasoned fries are great (really they're potato wedges, but who cares). They have several cheeses available so if you're a purist who HAS to have Wiz, they'll happily do it. The dining area is small. A handful of 2 toppers with a booth in the back. Perfect for couples and singles, but families will probably want to order to go.  Overall, I'd make the 42 mile drive for this place any day. The homey atmosphere, sweet and swift service and delicious food are so worth it."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until just the other day.  Finally, I had to give into my urge for Philly and headed down the road to check this place out.  Not very assuming on the outside, I will say.  The inside is pretty east coast...In a totally good way.    Not the kind of place you get fawned over it seems (unless you're a regular) but the customer service was certainly nice, and I got the food rather quick.    I tried the cheese steak with red sauce.  It was awesome!  It ain't the cheapest I've ever gotten but it was worth the trip.  I suspect that I will be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went the sandwich was delicious. This time I ordered the philly cheese steak with onions and red sauce. The chef was engrossed in getting the snack cakes they just ordered out. I get home and bit into the sandwich and realize something's missing. I look and it's just meat and cheese. I call and explain what happened and ask if I can come and get a new sandwich that I actually ordered. Now I have worked in food service and customer service for over 20 years and have never had the chef/cook get on the phone and argue about what he knows he gave me. That's what happened. He says I know what I gave you. You can add extra onions at home if you want. I told him I would happily bring the sandwich in to show him so he could see what I received. I decided to call it a loss and will never go there again thanks to having to argue about what I see as opposed to what they think I was given."}
{"text":"First ever visit here.  Reviews are encouraging.  We both ordered a Philly with red sauce.  The red sauce is actually very thin, and used more as a marinade.  They told me they do drizzle a bit on the sandwich, but they can't do too much or the bread will get mushy.  Makes sense.  The flavor was very nice.  The portion size was adequate.  The folks behind the counter were VERY friendly and helpful.  We both got combos, so there were fries and a drink.  My wife liked the fries better than I did.  I thought they were slightly overcooked.  Not burned, but a bit crisper than I usually like.  The friendliness of the people bring me to a solid four stars here."}
{"text":"You want a great Cheese Steak? Philly's Famous is the place!    A small shop with a dozen tables and a real family running the place.  Three generations working together and being together just like the neighbor shops back east.  This is the kinda character we are missing in Arizona.  What odors that have to do with a good cheese steak? Everything!  The daughter takes your order the mother runs the grill this shop is their lives and it just takes one bite of the steaming hot steak to know they care.  The bread is right, it's filled right and the red sauce is excellent.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been trying to find a good Philly cheesesteak in the area, and I'm so glad that my husband stumbled across this place!! First, the sandwich was seriously incredible. I got the pepper cheesesteak, and everything about it was perfect--soft delicious bread, tender meat, marinated grilled bell peppers, perfect amount of American cheese... It was DELICIOUS! On top of that, the people and the environment were so friendly and inviting! The older gentleman at the register, Mark (maybe the owner?) was so sweet and helpful. They were all so cute with my four year old son (who also LOVED his ham and cheese sandwich!)--as a mom, of course that made me happy :). I HIGHLY recommend this place and I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Fanatastic cheese steak sandwiches, made with or without red sauce and different cheeses including Cheez whiz. Hands down best Italian hoagie in Chandler! Always Great service from the whole staff."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients you can taste ! Very flavorful and large portions. Its my new favorite Philly shop , the customer service, food, and atmosphere is all top notch !"}
{"text":"Having lived in Philly I can truly say this place has the most authentic cheese steak I have had in Arizona... and I have lived in Az for over 20 years.   What's even better is the owners are the nicest people I have ever met. I threw them a couple bucks in tip (because the cheese steak was so amazing) and they were so appreciative.  Wish I could give this place 6 out of 5 stars. Not kidding."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwich! I had the chicken cheese steak with provolone. My husband had the original hoagie and he is a picky eater but enjoyed his sandwich as well. Grandma had the Philly cheesesteak and she liked hers, too. The owners seem like great people :) I love a family-owned eatery with good food and this fits the bill!"}
{"text":"They are good, but 20$ to feed one hungry man! Kinda pricey.... And that was just the original. We could go to a much better restaurant for 20/plate. I was good with half a sandwich so for me it was affordable just not the rest of the family!"}
{"text":"Ordered for first time from here. Went to pick up order and walked into the owner loudly complaining about a customer to his wife 10-15 feet away. With customer well within hearing distance. Awkward. Went one for a bit. I paid and said to the cashier that it was my first time and that this was not a good impression. Left a really bad taste in my mouth. Don't care what happened but that should have been handled in the back, in the office or outside   As for food, I ordered a cheese steak with onion and peppers wit wiz. Steak was tasty but there was barely any wiz on it. I want to give this place another shot but honestly don't see why."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've had an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak and this is right in that same wheel house. Highly recommend to anyone who loves a great cheesesteak! I've had Jersey Mikes for years and am now just discovering this place. Let me tell you Jersey Mikes is subpar compared to this joint. Keep killing it guys, see you soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on philly's by any means, don't eat them all that often these days, but I was in the mood one day.  I enjoyed their standard philly, very fresh bread, piping hot abundant fillings, good tasting.  The fries were very good, sizzling hot and tasty.    As I was eating there I caught a glimpse of their Italian hoagie and knew I had to come back for that, I did, and it was damn good.  I've been back many times and there are a few constants - a good thing these days.  They have a pretty regular crowd and many they know by name, the bread is always nice & fresh, ever so slightly sweet and so soft mmmm.  The fillings are always very fresh too, not a bad spot of lettuce, the tomatoes are nice & red/juicy, fresh onions, cheeses and meats.  And the fries are always hot!  I'm a little freaky about how the ingredients are layered and how a sandwich holds up til the end and I've never felt the need to rearrange the tomatoes or shift anything back to the last bite, never had a bread breakout or spill-through.   They pile on the meats & cheeses and they're nice & evenly layered.  I stop in fairly regularly because I know what I'll be getting, it'll be good and I feel that the staff truly appreciates my business.  They're very friendly and do things right.  Fortunately for me not a drop of Cheez Whiz around my food!"}
{"text":"Brings me right back to Jersey.  Very well done with great bread!   Very cool owners too, send some business their way, we want them to stay around."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. So yummy. Tried for the first time and will definitely be back.  The steak was juicy and tender, the bun was soft, and the cheese was yummy and gooey. The owner was so nice too. He even gave my kids a generous sized sample of Italian ice. Can't wait til I'm hungry again so I can go back."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place for years and never stopped in till a few weeks ago. Boy, I was missing some good stuff. I have tried a few of their sandwiches now and they're all delicious. This shops is family owned, and they are great people. They are a little more expensive than some other sandwich shops, but you certainly get a better quality sandwich. Also, the food is made to order, and it is made quickly. The atmosphere is consistent with the location, and facilitates the vibe of Philly. If you're in the area, make sure to try this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! My wife and I have been coming here for probably a year and a half now. We make it a point to eat a Philly Cheesesteak here at least once a month.  The food is fantastic! Make sure you try the red sauce. (We prefer to get ours on the side but either way is good!) Every time we come in we always get a big hello from the owners.  (The know us by name now) It makes us feel like we are back on the East Coast with the sense of hospitality they have here.  They treat every customer like they are family. Again, I love this place! I will continue to come here month after month, meal after meal! Amazing food! I cannot express it enough."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a Philly, hands down. Get the onions and red sauce. You won't be disappointed. Very friendly staff, can't beat it."}
{"text":"Great food and great people! Been coming here for years even more now that I work for the city! There cheese steaks are so good"}
{"text":"Very tasty! Great service. Gets a little crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"Nice staff, sweet caring owners. The food was fresh and tasty, not dry, but juicy and appetizing. I ordered the Buffalo, it was great, not spicy, just right, next time I will add tomatoes though."}
{"text":"I have been back several times and still love it!  This is one of the only two places in the valley I will go to for a Philly cheese-steak."}
{"text":"Yum!! I love the Italian sandwich,it is the best Italian Sammy I have had out west, since leaving the east coast. The Philly cheese steak is awesome as well. I usually get my Sammie's to go,but they have plenty of seating. It's clean and staff is very friendly. This should be everybody's go to sandwich shop in Chandler. Don't forget your Tastey Cake."}
{"text":"I have driven by the this place countless times and never even knew it was there. It's tucked into a tiny strip mall on the north side. The owners/employees are extremely friendly and very helpful. We ordered a Philly Mushroom Cheese Steak and a Turkey Hoagie. Although both were delicious, we agreed the Cheese Steak was amazing. It's a little bit of a drive for us but will continue to go back because it was that good. I highly recommend trying this hidden little gem. It's as close to the real thing as you're going to get without going to Philly."}
{"text":"Monty has been going on and on about this place for about a month now... so we finally made it there for lunch today.  I'm not a philly cheese steak fan and he wasn't feeling naughty enough to eat one either so we decided to be good and share an Italian hoagie (comes 8 - $5.50 or 12 - $8.50 inch)... he'd been building this place up so I was expecting really good stuff... and they delivered!  I can't say I'm all that surprised cuz he and I have similar taste and really, all we do all day is discuss food, making it, eating it, watching it on TV... anything about food!    So back to the hoagie... I was about to say that I'm not really a sub/hoagie/sammie girl, but apparently I am changing my ways!  This thing was fucking delicious!  Loads and loads of cotto & genoa salami,Italian ham, two Italian cheeses, piled high on a soft Italian roll with lettuce, tomato, onions, special oils and spices.  The bread was... god, I don't know, just.... well, it made me want to make out with that sandwich!  LOL... but really, I love bread and for me this usually makes or breaks a sandwich.  So obviously the bread was damn good... the meat... sooooooo fresh and tasty and thinly sliced.  Generous, but not too meaty... not meaty to the point of making me feel like a big oaf after when I was done :o)  Kay... what else, what else.... OH!  the fries $1.99... they were hot and fresh and seasoned, cuz, well, we ordered the seasoned ones.  Theyre the old school wedges.  They also have regular ones $1.69... I'll get them tomorrow... yes... I'm going back tomorrow... probably... hopefully.  OMG I'm rambling.. sorry.  One last thing:  Its Italian owned and operated.  That NEVER hurts in my book.  They're fast, friendly and it feels like they really want your business... they even say thank you and good bye and all that nice stuff - AND it even sounds sincere!  I know right!  So... go there and and try it... you won't be dissapointed!  And if you are - well whatever, I guess you're too fucking picky!    Kay, I'll shut up now."}
{"text":"Stopped in philly's famous after an appointment before heading back to northern az.  The whole reason we stopped was because of yelp reviews and these guys didn't disappoint! The staff was fun and friendly, and make you feel at home. My wife and I went with standard philly's with onions and whiz, of course. It had super thin chopped steak, plenty of whiz, and perfect onions. The roll was soft and the overall sandwich...really good. I would def. Recommend and go again"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best place on earth to eat food. Honestly, their cheesesteaks are so good they bring me literal tears of joy."}
{"text":"Best Philly's in Chandler.  So much better than what you get on most bar menus.  I would really like to know what the mysterious red sauce is that they put on it, but I guess I will never know."}
{"text":"As a PA native, I have a high standard for cheese steaks.  These guys make the best steak in Chandler, if not the whole valley. Rolls are fresh and a little chewy and the sauce is on point (a little spicy, not sweet), which are key details that seal the deal.  The staff are super sweet. Family owned, and always so friendly.   This is a true mom and pop shop, which comes with its own issues. We have called a few times and they had run out of bread. Also, they are not open on Sunday's.   All that said: we love this place, and the owners. :-)"}
{"text":"Great food but staff needs to stop fighting in front of customers . We'll definitely be back but will take it to go next time"}
{"text":"****update***** I have reviewed before and I just wanted to give a quick addition to this review. Today my husband had to go to Phoenix for a work thing (we live in Yuma) and he calls me asking if I want him to bring me home some Phillies best (dumb question cuz of course I do) but I ask him \"Can you see if they can separate the meat and cheese from the bread and wrap separately (I hate soggy bread). Well not only did they happily do so but they went out of their way to make him feel welcomed and that they were more than happy to accommodate my strange request. And this is why we will keep going back even if it's to have One brought 3 hours back just for the spoiled wife to get her Phillie cheesesteak fix.************    I want to move to Chandler just to be able to eat here every week. We came up from Yuma to take my son to an appointment and I found this place nearby. The sandwiches were exactly what Philly cheesesteaks are supposed to be. My son had the meatball and mozzarella and I admit to sneaking a bite and the sauce just wow amazing. The service was friendly and was like walking into someone's home. Go go go"}
{"text":"I use to work at this establishment and I loved it!  Rita and her family are such nice people and they always interact with their customers.  I was 18 when I worked there and my dad one day just refused to take me anymore and I had no way to get there, but it was my favorite job I've had so far!  I love the hoagies!  The Italian Hoagie is my favorite by far!  The bread is fresh and so soft!  It can get very busy at lunch time, so if you want to try it I would go after 2!"}
{"text":"Lunch was great, sandwich was everything I wanted in a true philly steak sandwich, even my daughter love it and she's a picky eater.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Nice family owned business. We got the buffalo chicken and the \"philly\" without red sauce. I like the philly the best! Will return when we have a craving for cheese steak."}
{"text":"Good for cheesesteaks outside of Philly but don't come here if you're in a pinch for time. It just took 20+ minutes to get a sandwich. There's three customers in the store and four employees behind the counter jibber jabbing and not paying attention to the grill. This is a recurring theme.  I've also been given a sandwich not made the way I asked. They were out of the cheese I ordered so they just picked a replacement for me, it was quite foul.   The employees are sooo friendly and sandwiches are good so it's hard to only give 3 stars but service can be excruciatingly slow."}
{"text":"Solid place and solid owners. Saw the good reviews and thought I would take it for a spin. Oh man....it is TOO good. Classic philly with a side of fries. Cannot go wrong! The price is very fair as well! I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"delicious. The first time i went i left without ordering because i smelled cleaning chemicals, but then i read again somewhere about how great they were. so glad i gave them a chance. Food delicious, owner very personable and really wants to please his customers."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best cheesesteaks around and great service! This is definitely a family run operation and they take pride in every sandwich. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"I have now been a customer at Philly's famous for almost five years, and still the best place to get a cheese steak!"}
{"text":"YUM! Probably the best cheese steak I've had in AZ. The meat melts in your mouth, the flavors (yes I've had them more than once) are distinct for each. Lately I've been craving more of the spicy sandwiches and if you talk to Marc he will hook you up! They have a special spicy sauce that really adds some kick.  Marc is the owner of Philly's and he is the nicest man! So willing to cook up anything delicious - and I really like that he tries out new things.   Give this place a try, I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food and great people there. Although I have driven by this place for years I will be a regular customer now regardless of where I live in the Valley.   I had the pleasure of meeting Mark, one of the owners as well as his wife and family members. Besides the great food you can tell that they love what they do.   I look forward to MANY more meals here now that I know where it is after driving by it so many times for months.   Trust me. You are going to LOVE this place! It was my first time here but definitely not my last!  Kudos to the family for offering such great food and service."}
{"text":"The best cheesesteak I've ever had!!! Meat and peppers mushroom all diced together, with white American and cheese whiz. Flavor is amazing. Pastrami sandwich was good. Wife had the meatball and they have a great sauce, meatball seasoned perfectly. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Great gamily ran establishment. Home girl on the grill made the best Philly cheesesteak I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for cheese steaks,   The staff is beyond nice and greeted me by name the second time I walked in the door.  Visiting this place is like going to visit friends. I have gotten to know a few of the family members first names but I still do not know their last name.  This is one of the few places that carry Tasty Cakes.  It is noisy inside and I wish they had outdoor seating, but it is not so bad to keep me away.  Try it out, take a moment and say hi to the staff and ask them what they recommend, By the time you leave, they will make you feel like family too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for nearly 6 years. The staff (family owned and operated) makes you feel welcome and at home (even 1st time visitors should be comfortable coming here). I have tried every sandwich at least once. Not only are the sandwiches made with an artistic touch, they are AWESOME tasting, with each one getting between 4 and 5 stars! And, you get plenty of meat and toppings for the price.  It does get a bit noisy during peak hours (since they chop the Philly Steak meat with a metal spatula on the grill). Also, the TastyCake deserts are darn good, too. With me, they got a customer for life."}
{"text":"This is the place for Philly Cheesesteak in Arizona. The food is great and the service is tremendous from a Family owned restaurant. Better get there early because it gets busy. Don't forget the cheese whiz!"}
{"text":"We came in at a slow time and were delightfully greeted by the staff (owner maybe?) We came in hungry for cheese-steaks and left extremely satisfied.  Definitely a fan of this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! There is a sign in the front that  says \"worlds best cheese steaks\". I wouldnt say world but this is the best Philly Cheese steaks in the state of Arizona.  Prices on food is fair  Staff is super friendly  Place needs to upgrade  Great place with great food"}
{"text":"I'm gonna cast an appropriate review for this type of cuisine and experience. So those of you looking for elegant ambiance need to head elsewhere or check those expectations at the door and just bask in the tasty glory.  Philly's Famous is the unparalleled ZENITH for cheesesteaks in the valley, maybe the Southwest... but I'm gonna keep an open mind, I haven't been everywhere in the SW yet.  I've had 3 steaks from Philly's so far. They have all been tasty authentic representations of Philadelphia's gift to American joy. My frame of reference comes from numerous work trips to Philly, PA. I'm talkin' TRUTH - John's Roast Pork, Joe's Steaks, & Steve's Prince of Steaks... not the touristy nastiness of Pat's or Geno's.  So! Philly's Famous steaks are amazing. And that's the way it is.  The owner is very friendly and always happy you've come by. In fact, everyone there makes you feel welcome. On our first trip, my wife asked about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich while we were ordering. The owner turned from working his magic at the grill and told her the Buffalo Chicken was his favorite. \"I make a different sauce I put on mine. I'll give you some. I think it's even better with the sauce.\" He visited us at our table with the sauce. Darcie said the sandwich was great by itself and even better with the sauce. I thought it was excellent as well, but I'm more of a purist and I have to have a cheesesteak. And, MAN! those do not disappoint. I get the Jack Cheese Steak with onions and peppers. Lordy!  The ambiance definitely has the Philly feel, with the exception that the staff does NOT exude the patented Philadelphia impatient attitude. It's a great experience, full 360°.  If you're looking for a way to boost your happiness, head over to Philly's Famous.  QE-em-effin-D!  I'm really not sure why I'm not there now. Where are my keys?"}
{"text":"I love the cheese steak! The cheese is ooey and gooey throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is so fresh and soft. I ate here the first time 6 years ago and have been back several times since. If you are a regular customer, you are treated like family!"}
{"text":"I got the mushroom philly cheestake with red sauce and peppers. It had great flavor and had the perfect amount of spice. The store was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"This wonderful cheesesteak restaurant offers truly authentic steaks. We have been to \"the institution\" in Philadelphia, and spent a few years in NY. Not to mention the array of cities we have visited across the country in search of the perfect steak. Philly's Famous beats them all. Even the extras like fries and onion rings are a cut above. We noticed the outstanding service and happy attitude of the staff. We really noticed the steak chef at the grill elegantly working as if he were striking the keys of a grand piano. Such love and attention to food can only lead to the best results."}
{"text":"Great Family! Awesome Philly's. My new favorite place!  Goodbye Mill Ave:)"}
{"text":"Great food and the people who work there are so friendly and nice! Waffle fries and originally Philly is what I had, soo yummy and an okay price for how good the food is!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time and it was beyond delicious!  What made our experience even more special was the team behind the counter, they give the establishment such a friendly family feel.  90% of the customers who walked in were greeted not only by name but they knew exactly how they wanted their Philly's to be made!!  We will definitely come back and they will know our names, too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Cheesesteak, and better price than Capriottis.  You want the best? Look no further than this place.  Staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Philly and these are some of the best cheesesteaks around. And cheap too. They even come with American cheese (or wiz) and use Amoroso's rolls. Just ask for your cheesesteak without sauce (marinara)...that's weird. The only cheesesteaks that have sauce in Philly are called pizza steaks, and they are delicious and have mozzarella cheese on them. Anyway, this place is great!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST cheesesteak in Phoenix!  The Original Cheesesteak and the Italian Hoagie are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, staff was nice. Good place to get some good food. Buffalo chicken sandwich is fire"}
{"text":"First time here.  Came because of the good Yelp reviews.  I was set for hot pastrami but they were out(actually had enough for a sample, YUM!) Anyway the chief said he would make me what I wanted and I told him to make me smile. He did.  Back tomorrow with a friend to eat a whole pastrami!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing and perfect cheesesteak outside of Philadelphia! It was our first time stopping and the restaurant was super busy, but the owner was so attentive. As the others have said, definitely get the red sauce. We have found our new favorite restaurant in the entire Phoenix metro area!!"}
{"text":"First timer here.  This place was good. Met my expectations :)  For starters it was busy. If you can wait till after lunch to go, then I'd suggest doing so. Took me about 15 minutes to get my 1 sandwich to go. I wasn't surprised after seeing how many people came in before and after me while waiting.  Seating is very limited. Its kinda of cramped and very loud in this place because of how many people are here. Its all for good reason though.  My Philly Cheese steak with onions and red sauce was great. I got a 12 inch size and it wasn't that filling believe it or not. That was the only thing disappointing to me. I wanted to be full! lol  Regardless, I found my new Philly Cheese steak spot going forward :)"}
{"text":"So yummy! Love the cheesesteak with peppers and mushrooms. Huge sandwiches and great prices."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing only surpassed by their service! They had me trying different kinds to make sure I was getting it just the way I wanted it. Amazing !"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich, must eat in restaurant though as it will get far to soggy if you take it home. Don't forget that the REAL philly cheesesteak has either white american or cheez whiz so take your provolone business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I grew up in South Jersey and I really do appreciate a good cheesesteak.  Bread is very important, as those of us east-coasters will tell you.  These guys don't dissapoint.  The bread is perfect, the cheesesteaks are cheesy and they're hot and fresh and made right in front of you.  Absolutely delish!  I've probably had a dozen so far and all were exactly the same - excellent.  The staff - well they are quite the cast of characters.  They're just like family.  You can't help but laugh along with them."}
{"text":"This place  is amazing.  Best Steak Subs in Arizona. Food is always fresh and hot. Owners and employees are always nice and friendly.  Clean and neat. Great location. I also love the Tuna subs. They make their food with love."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough nice things about Philly's Famous! From the moment you walk in the door, you love this place. Everyone that works there is so friendly and so helpful, in a very genuine way...and the food really is AMAZING. It reminds me of all the little family-owned restaurants I grew up with in Jersey/PA. My husband and I can't get enough of this place!  Tip: Get a Philly cheese steak, with sauce :)"}
{"text":"Love this place awesome cheesesteak's and hoagies and with the back east attitude simply reminds me of Philly!"}
{"text":"I drove all the way down from North Scottsdale to check this place out and it was 100% worth it. The guy at the counter (Mark) made me feel right at home and even shook my hand after I asked his name. Feels and operates like a family business.   I ordered the Phillys with red sauce, onions, mushrooms, and whiz. It was the best cheesesteak I've ever had. Fries were great- hot and the perfect complement to the cheesesteak.   I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I asked a colleague at work about a good cheesesteak place in Chandler area and he recommended this place.  I went there Saturday April 30.  It certainly meets all the basic credentials for a good cheesesteak restaurant: hole-in-the-wall, one-of-a-kind family business.  (Well actually this place is a little bigger).   I had the mushroom cheesesteak with the red sauce.  Quite good, all the ingredients merged together.  Diet Coke fountain soda was also key.  For sure I will return though I will check out some of other highly rated cheesesteak places in Chandler/Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Great food, friendly staff. I love a good cheesesteak and this place does NOT disappoint. Small inside, but don't let that turn you off - they know what they're doing. Second time I've been here and I will certainly be back. If you're in the area, check it out"}
{"text":"Better than steak escape.  Not as good as a Philly I had just outside of PIA from a food truck.  (American & Wiz Whit is what I had in Phill ::angels singing:: I had American Whit here).  I'd say it's one of the better places to get a philly in arizona, in fact, I don't think I've had better in the valley, but I don't tend to order them out here either.  I wish the crust of the bread was, well, crusty, but the bread itself was soft.  Meat and onions were great, but I probably should have asked for double meat and onions.  I didn't ask for wiz, didn't think they had it.    What makes this place great is the people.  Everyone was so sweet and nice, making a point to call me by name.  The cook even double wrapped my red sauce on the side to help keep the lid on top of the plastic cup.  I forgot about the sauce lol so I didn't even try it, but the gesture was really nice."}
{"text":"I had said in a previous review that my Favorite Philly was a different busines. Today Jan 30 2018 I found a new place for Best Philly sandwich. Based on taste alone My cheesesteak here was the best in AZ.  The staff was very nice as well.  Sorry I didn't take a photo I just couldn't wait to eat it after watching and listening to Chef Eddie smack the spatulas on the the Flat Top. We do so next time I'm back."}
{"text":"Yay Philly cheesesteaks!  Been craving it all day!  Go to place locally for an authentic Philly cheese steak or hoagie.  02/01/13.  Back for the second weekend in a row.  Wish I was on this side of town more often.  Tried the Italian Cheesesteak this time and was not disappointed.  Made-to-order piping hot, quality steak with grilled onions and provolone cheese .  No surprise that this place is always busy.  If you haven't been yet, you've gotta try it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of time and have always been very satisfied. I haven't had a better Philly cheese steak in town. The only thing that could detract is the wait time during lunch rush. A word to wise, order ahead of time and it will be a seem less experience in getting some delicious food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite philly shops anywhere! Not only are the sandwiches off the hook, but the owners are the nicest people who always remember you when you come in. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Good little place!  I had the 8\" meatball sub and my girlfriend had the 8\" cheesesteak and we both agreed that we would come back.  We also split an order of the seasoned fries, which are like potato wedges with a curly fry batter.    I was full the rest of the day off this meal!  We live close now so we will be making this our regular sandwich shop!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area over the weekend around lunchtime and were feeling a bit hungry.  I checked Yelp to see what was around and gave the hubby a couple of choices.  Having been born in Philly, of course he chose Philly's Famous.  I'm so glad he did! It was delicious!! We decided to split a 12 inch Original Hoagie and our daughter went with the Buffalo Chicken.  Both were phenomenal.  And the family that runs the place were so nice and helpful.  I'd definitely like to return and try a cheesesteak.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Having lunch at Philly Famous in Chandler. I tastes like Delasandro's in Philly!!!!!! Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly the best sandwich I have had in Arizona. I have been here twice because I frequent that side of town not often but I do wish I lived closer. I ordered the classic Philly and seasoned wedges both times I went and both times it was amazing. The bread is fresh and soft yet seems different than what you would buy at the store or have at the run of the mill sandwich shops. The meat is not too greasy nor dry and the toppings of the philly are perfectly blended in. Everything seems to complement each other leaving your taste buds in absolute bliss. Next time I go I'll branch out and order something else and be sure to update my review but man it's worth an hour drive for me. I would suggest this to all of my yelp friends and can't wait to be back there. It seems like a family ran business and everyone behind the counter was super polite and nice. Not many five stars out there but they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop restaurant in the heart of Chandler.  Don't be fooled by the location.  This restaurant is a hidden gem.  Best cheesesteak sandwich in my 40 years in Phoenix!  The sandwich was fresh, hot and amazing!  Loved my first visit to this restaurant, definitely worth the  wait!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  My husband and I both had the original Philly with Cheese Wiz and red sauce on the side.  He added a side of potato wedges and we both got drinks.  The 8\" sandwich was more than enough for each of us and I felt it was very reasonably priced for the food you got.  I loved my sandwich and wanted to lick the paper when I was done lol.  The staff were super friendly and attentive and it was clear that they really cared about the experience and enjoyment of their customers.  We will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"I'd been in the mood for a real philly cheese steak for quite a while, and this place fit the bill!  i went in there a little before the dinner rush, so I didn't have to wait, and was greeted by a very pleasant and helpful cashier. the meat and sandwich were very tasty, but it almost looks like they were using steak-um's like what you buy a the store.  I've never been to Philadelphia, so im not sure if thats traditional or not, because I know using Cheese Wiz is something they do there too.  The sandwich I ordered had provolone, and it was melted perfectly and mixed in with my chopped steak and onions.  Ordered the 8in, and it filled me up fine.  Overall, if you looking for a great cheese steak and service with a smile, go there!"}
{"text":"I get the basic philly (mushroom, chz, peppers, and onions) every time and every time it's AWESOME!! I won't order a Philly any where else in the valley!"}
{"text":"Phillys Famous I am a bit behind on reviewing for this place. The bread is very fresh, vegetables nice, crisp. The belly rub is a very filling, great tasting sandwich. Cute little diner feel on the inside. I have called/ordered takeout from here and have never had any problems or mix ups, but I'm sure their customer service is fantastic with such a nice family team working on the inside. Get yourself some good philly cheesesteak made with love right here!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on a Google search.  The food was fabulous, they even had Cheese Whiz!  But the family that runs this restaurant is friendly and excited to greet you as you enter.  Great customer service.  We wil be back!  And their daughter is a great girl to chat with while you enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"We moved to The Valley of the Sun from Center City Philly 2 1/2 years ago and started our search for a real Philly cheesesteak. Last Friday our search ended successfully at Philly's Famous. Even in Philly everyone has their preferences with regard to their cheesesteak, but, for us, Eddie and Rita have put together a cheesesteak that scored on every count from the beef to the roll. The most difficult piece of the puzzle, based on our experience, has been finding a roll that matches up with what you get in Philly, and theirs does. We had provolone cheesesteaks with mushrooms and onions; I added jalapenos for a little heat on mine. They were GREAT!!! Even the sound of Eddie's banging of his metal spatula while cooking added to the familiarity and flavor. Eddie and Rita are warm and welcoming. They made us feels special even on a busy Friday night when we were lucky enough to get in our orders before those wonderful rolls ran out. Having fresh ingredients is part of the key. They bring in their beef (kosher ribeye, as I recall) all the way from New York to make sure they are producing a quality product and they do. They understand their customer's expectations. The shop is covered with photos and other Philly memorabilia including from both Geno's and Pat's. It gave a the feeling as if we were back in Philly. They also had tasty water ice which was delicious and a perfect way to top off our meal; another taste of Philly. To give you an idea of just how good they are, we met a couple who drove up from Maricopa just for the Philly's Famous cheesesteaks and they come with some regularity. He, too, is a Philly emigrant is search of a taste that brings him home to Philly. We are already making plans to bring other friends from The Valley who grew up in Philly to get them a taste of home. I apologize if this review seems long winded, but the difficult search for true Philly cheesesteaks is finally over for us! Bottom line: if you're looking for the real deal Philly cheesesteak, what you would get back in Philly, you must go to Philly's Famous! Thank you Eddie and Rita for bringing us home!"}
{"text":"Good News: Great italian sub, great cheesesteak. They even carry Tastycakes. Very friendly staff.  Bad News: They are not the sharpest family. Watch the chaos that ensues when you place your order. They start screaming to each other and like playing the game whisper down the lane your order changes right in front of your eyes. Double check that they understood your order."}
{"text":"This place has the best Philly cheesesteak I've every eaten. The employees are extremely nice as well."}
{"text":"Best philly for real! Excellent mom and pop shop with super friendly owners who are always in a great mood. Fresh cooked to order everytime. I always order the philly mushroom pepper with extra cheese and hot peppers. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Best Philly I've ever had and the customer service is awesome! Came for a sandwich and left with a sandwich and new friends"}
{"text":"Yeah, this is a damn good sandwich.  Its not your typical super gooey cheese steak, its got a far more authentic feel than that. I believe each is good in their own right, but Philly's Famous is a notch above. I was skeptical when they first asked if I wanted red sauce on my Philly, but it was recommended. Being one that prefers to experience food the way it was intended, I added the red sauce. Red sauce is now a must for every Philly's Famous experience. I get the Pepper Jack Philly with grilled onions.  I do love a green pepper in the mix, but I do not like the sweet pickled green peppers they (and pretty much all other philly places) offer.  That is purely my taste preference, not a fault of theirs.   Its family owned and operated.  What a great family too, my goodness, they are the nicest people. After only a couple times there they began to recognize me, which added a nice personal touch, and they still remember me if I haven't been there in a while.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious Philly's! Definitely one of the best I have had in quite a while and prices are fair.   The fries are just OK so I would recommend skipping those and ordering more sandwich :)"}
{"text":"We love this place! Every time we are in the staff is friendly, helpful and happy! And the food? Absolutely amazing. Definitely the best we've had in the valley! It's definitely worth the try... we are so glad that we did and will keep coming back! :)"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Had the original philly, but it was so bland, I even needed to add a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the red sauce. Note: the sauce is not at all spicy. Ill say, they ensure to keep the food warm even for pick up, so thats nice, the cheese was still hot when I had it at home. Also the people are really polite and nice. But not a place ill be trying anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food was okay. More bread over steak filling. Fries were served in a very small serving. What stood out is the cook (owner) argued consistently with a customer who felt they were overcharged the entire time we were there. Overall it was an okay sandwich if you want a philly style hoagie. Loud exchange over price...free of charge on this day."}
{"text":"Eating here makes me reminisce about our trip to Philadelphia where we ate our weight in cheesesteak. The interior is casual with lots of Philly memorabilia and you can hear the tell-tale metallic sounds of thinly sliced steak being cooked and chopped up on a griddle.  The menu is limited to Philly steaks and hoagies with fries or chips as sides. You have your choice of 6\" or 12\". We shared a 12\" mushroom pepper cheesesteak and seasoned fries.   The cheesesteak had tender meat and was a good filling portion with the soft bread. The peppers were a mix of various colored bell peppers and there were a few mushrooms in it. I couldn't really taste the mushrooms too much but I did like the crunch of the peppers with the soft textures of the meat, cheese and bread. If they had an option for hot peppers I would have gotten those with the sandwich as well. The cheese was ooey-gooey, well meshed within the meat.  The fries were a mix of wedges and long cut potatoes. The exterior was nicely seasoned and lightly crisp, with a soft fluffy textured interior.   The one thing I did notice about this cheesesteak that set it apart from cheesesteaks I've enjoyed in Philly is that the meat was more dry in the sandwich. This might sound weird but it was almost too clean of an eating experience. Usually when I've had a spectacular Philly the meat is very juicy and the cheese free flowing which creates an abominable mess running down your arms and soaking your hands thoroughly. Now am I saying I like wet or soggy sandwiches? No! I like a little more moisture in my filling, that's all. I do appreciate that this style of Philly cheesesteak is easier on your laundry bill though.   We came here around 7ish and when we finished around 7:30 they had run out of bread and could not serve any more sandwiches, so get here as early as you can to prevent potential Philly cheesesteak heartbreak! Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and I think this is close to what you will find in the Philly area, without resorting to a trip to the other side of the U.S. :)"}
{"text":"I came here as part of a Living Chandler facebook group event. The staff was very friendly and made it a great experience. It is good to see a nice, family run business in town and doing well. I went with the cheesesteak with mushrooms and peppers. Excellent! Grab a drink and bag of chips to make it a meal. One of the best cheesesteaks around in town."}
{"text":"Amazing family run business owners are so nice and the food is so good.   I always get the same thing. Cheesesteak and red sauce but everything looks amazing. Great value"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Philly's Famous this morning. Once again, they did not disappoint. The italian cheese steak sandwich was great! It occurred to me that the folks behind the counter really do treat you like family. Your food is not prepared by indifferent teenagers who really don't care if you like your meal or not. They take great pride in what they do, and in the food they serve, and you can see that. We need more of these locally owned, non-national-franchise restaurants where the owners interact with the customers and serve an exceptional ( as opposed to acceptable) product.  They have added a couple of booths since my last visit, so it's not all tables and chairs anymore. The restaurant is small, but it's very clean and the food is always top notch and the service is always excellent. For not much more than a lunch combo at one of the burger chains, you can have good food served by a nice group of people. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have the best Philly cheesesteak sandwiches around! Make sure to order it with the cheese whiz. Another good sandwich is the original hoagie. It has tons of meat on it!! This place is family run and they treat you like your part of the family."}
{"text":"The 12in Cheese Steak with Wiz is a home run!! It's packed with meat and oozing with cheese & can really fill up two people! The only thing negative was the service wasn't 100% I felt like the man and woman were rude, but food is good."}
{"text":"I checked this place out because they have such a good rating, but it was very average. I had a cheesesteak, the meat was chopped so small it gave it almost a hamburger texture... Not one of my faves. I prefer steak escape at the mall."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering!!!! I recently discovered this place and I am completely enamored! Coming from the east coast,  it's really hard to find quality bread let alone a cheesteak worthy of being called a Philly cheesesteak. Famous has perfected their culinary craft! ! I love mine with extra cheese (American) and their secret ingredient, love!! This family owned,  family run business care about what they create and the passion is revealed in the taste. Thank you Famous  Philly and keep up the amazing quality food and super service!! See you later this week!!!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks are very good but an hour to wait for a sandwich is just way too much. Also, there was no warning of how long the wait would be, and every time we asked how much longer, we were told 15 more minutes. It is too bad, nice family business, just not run effectively."}
{"text":"I can't call myself a cheese steak expert, but in my opinion, Philly Famous is an excellent AZ spot for cheese steaks. The portions of meat are extremely generous; it's not riveted, but flavorful and tender nonetheless.   Extremely friendly employees. The cheesecake are made one at a time to order, so expect a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"BEST Philly Cheesesteaks in AZ !!!   This place is awesome.  Very hole in the wall but doesn't get more authentic.  The owners are super friendly and always happy to talk to you.    Love their signature red sauce on the cheesesteaks it makes them that much better.  I've never been to Philly but I imagine if I do this is what it would be and taste like.  If you come here enough they will remember you and what you order. How awesome is that.  I hope this place last forever as it's a staple in Chandler."}
{"text":"We live in Chandler, so we get take out here probably once a month. My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion, these are the best cheesesteaks around! We love their spicy peppers (they are hot!) and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan, their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous! The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it!   We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"My go-to for Philly cheesesteaks back in the day was the Philadelphia Sandwich Company, back when they were alongside Scottsdale Rd, and later, when they moved to the bigger location with a bar. Then I got wind of news that they had closed down and I guess I kind of went through the various stages of grief, namely the bit where I refused to acknowledge the existence of Philly cheesesteaks. But Yelp knows me, and Philly's Famous kept coming up on my list of suggestions, as if to nudge me along, rekindling the fire in my stomach's metaphorical heart for my love of Philly cheesesteaks. Fine, Yelp. I'll check Philly's Famous out.  And I have no regrets. If you love cheese, this is it. If you love a hot sub, this is it. If you want your money's worth in meat, this is it. If you're having issues finding a Philly cheesesteak place to satisfy your craving, or are in need of a large snack, or like yours truly, trying to get over the loss of your ex-Philly cheesesteak-ery, this is it. Although I can't attest to the authenticity of their Philly cheesesteaks since I've never been to Philly, I can say they mean it when they say extra cheese, that the cheesesteaks are only made after you place your order, and the bread is so soft that I wouldn't even complain if I got more bread than meat in a bite - though I can assure you, that does not happen.  In a nutshell, (insert Fry meme) shut up and take my money!"}
{"text":"My meat was burned the service was poor. It took 10 minutes to process my debit card . I will not be going to Philly's Famous ever again."}
{"text":"First time trying it today since it was close by. Nice ladies in there. Liked that my food was nice and hot, made to order. Steak could've been seasoned a bit more but other than that, it was good. Got the red sauce on the side because i didn't know exactly what it was, but after tasting it, I could do without it. Would definitely will eat there again, 3.5/5."}
{"text":"My family and I  just ordered  3 Philly cheese steaks, and they were amazing! The best steaks in the state! Friendly staff and they greet everyone that walks thru the door!"}
{"text":"Tastes like home! They have the bust subs and they are the only place that taste like back east.  I love there cold subs.  The only negative I can think of his how busy they are at lunch time!"}
{"text":"If you've been here more than once or twice they probably remember your name and greet you with it on the way in. I've been here maybe 20 times by now and never have I had a subpar experience. Rita and the rest are so kind and make you feel like family, or friends at the least. I have and will continue to recommend to all!!!"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak ever! Wow!  Looks like a lil whole in the wall but fantastic food.  Great service"}
{"text":"You won't find a sandwich place better then this! Eat here you won't regret it.   PS if you eat here and don't like it. nobody likes you."}
{"text":"OMG! My husband just picked up two of the Philly Cheese steaks (mine had the sweet bell peppers on it) and this sandwich was amazing.   Like, OMG! I don't know if it's because I'm 8months preggo and was craving cheese steaks really bad or what, but y'all this sandwich was so good! Even my 3 year old liked it after trying a bite, and she is one picky eater!  But let me back up- we ordered two \"Philly\" cheese steaks with fries, and a kid's nuggets meal. The cheese steaks were cooked perfectly. They were hot, flavorful, and the sauce and cheese made the sandwich taste wonderful. The bread was nicely toasted. The fries were really good as well- not too hard and not too soft, and seasoned very well.  My daughter liked her chicken nuggets. We tried one, and I could see why she liked them! They too were well seasoned and had a nice crispness to them. My 3 year old definitely approved of her kids meal!  Overall, very pleased and extremely satisfied with my meal, and entire order. We will most definitely be re-ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"So far it's the best Philly cheese I've had here in the Phoenix east valley.  It was a lunchtime line but the service was quick.  I had a favorite cheese steak stop in Salt Lake City and after a year I found one to match.  It's worth the drive to get here."}
{"text":"Very good food! Unfortunately it is hot as hades in there. Recommend that you call ahead and take home. We had the 12 in philly cheese steak and it was yummy! Didnt add the red sauce but my husband said it was ok."}
{"text":"Hands down the best philly cheese steak place around. I have been coming here since a friend recommended it a year ago. Every time you enter, you are greeted with a warm welcome. Super friendly. I have tried a couple different cheese steak s and hoagies, but always come back to the original with wizz. If you are looking for a consistently amazing food, don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the \"served with an attitude\" service comment in the reviews. The food was plain, everyone that came in after me got there food before me. Ordered the philly with fries and a drink. Philly lacked flavor and was soggy. The fries were way overcooked, the self serve soda might have been the best part of the experience. For a having a geno's shirt on the wall, I expected more, a must when in philly."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. The service was good, family friendly staff. The food was out QUICK, and did not sacrifice flavor for the speed. Glad to have stopped by."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteaks are so good, I though I was sitting at Jim's on South Street for a minute. It takes a little while to get them, but well worth the wait. Get the belly buster with everything on it."}
{"text":"My god so good mmmmmphsddj  The holy grail of sweet meat au jus coupled with mushrooms and onions transcended me into an experience akin to a stoner and a late night Taco Bell run~   I planned on saving half for later but that failed... Also eating and driving with this beast was a challenge as the juices dripped everywhere, BUT THATS OK CUZ I LOVE YOU MR. JUICE (Most cheesesteak places have dry beef :'( )  And with the summer buy one get half off deal its even better, for the price of subway I can get a Philly cheese x deux  Staff was bickering and apologized but I barely noticed, with a sandwich this good you could burn down my house for all I care.  Just a warning - you might have to change yo pants after eating here  *Almost as good as Jin's Grill in SD"}
{"text":"Good steak, so-so bread, nice folks with Philly memorabilia and even Tastykake. Hit up Rita's on McClintock afterwards for a nice Philly weekend. Their default includes 'red sauce' though which is NOT typical in Philadelphia, so if you want a regular steak order without it."}
{"text":"Every time I go in here memorize my order and always take care of you as if your family. Food is always hot and you must get there before they run out of bread as this place is a secret get there when you can it's definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Well I was taking my daughter here to get her a sandwich, but I was going to eat at home, but after we got in the car to head home, she gave me a piece to eat..let me tell you..we are eating there tonight for dinner..you gotta get here..friendly service, love is in the kitchen for real"}
{"text":"Philly's Famous has a banner out in front of the restaurant touting,   \"WORLD'S BEST CHEESE STEAK\"  Now I don't have cheese steak very often.  In Boston they're not even called cheese steaks or hoagies they are grinders or more specifically \"grine-dahs\".  So this is the first cheese steak I've had since moving to AZ.    The cheese steak comes default with a \"red sauce\" which I declined.  I've only eaten in Philadelphia a few times so I have no idea if authentic \"Philly Cheese Steaks\" come with some kind of red sauce.  I like mine with cheese, grilled onions, peppers and mushrooms.  The peppers they put on the sandwich were slightly sweet pickled peppers, picked personally by the peck by Peter Piper.  This was a pretty good sandwich.  Not the world's best, probably not even Arizona's best.  Maybe Chandler's best?  Unequivocally,  \"BEST CHEESE STEAK WITHIN 1 MILE OF THE INTERSECTION OF ALMA SCHOOL AND RAY RD!\""}
{"text":"Great Philly Cheese. Good Service. Solid Steak, add the wiz you'll be satisfied. Great game day or cheat day food."}
{"text":"Feel like I just walked into the city of brotherly love! Amazing cheesesteaks and friendly people who go way out of their way to serve you with a smile!"}
{"text":"No nonsense. The meat was seasoned very well.  The bread was soft and fresh.  The philly cheese steak was exactly what I wanted and more.  Friendly people.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Don't believe the sign out front. While it is an OK cheese steak, it's definitely not the world's best. I had to ask for cheese whiz, and it really wasn't that flavorful.  Bread was fresh, and they are made to order, but I would compare it to Steak Escape at the mall and a little overpriced.  The service is extremely friendly though, I will give that 5 stars, but my money will be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"First experience eating here and it was delicious! I love Philly cheesesteaks and they did not disappoint. They make the meat fresh so if you are patient it is worth the ten minutes or so to get your meal! Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"The philly chesse steak sandwich is amazing!!! It's delicious the staff is super nice the lady working the front was awesome and very friendly I highly recommend going In and trying the Philly chesse sandwich you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich place around.  They have this not so secret sauce that they cook the meat in, whatever you do make sure you get this option.  I have tried almost everything on their menu and I have never been disappointed. The customer service is great, attitude is great, all over favorite lunch place in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I came here once before on a bad day for them, have now been back here a couple of times since.  Love the cheesesteaks and the service is now awesome.  I am glad that I gave them another chance.  The owners are very nice and very customer oriented."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am always greeted with smiles and amazing service. They make you feel like you are part of there family! The pastrami is beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"As I'm from the East coast, I thought I'd give this place a try to see what their philly cheese steak sandwiches were like.  Was I disappointed or not?  Location & Aesthetics - located on N Alma School Road in Chandler and was very easy to locate with their signage.   Lots of available parking.  Parking lot is shared with other surrounding businesses but was big enough with plenty of spaces. Seating was only available indoors (no outdoor dining) with smaller tables and chairs toward the front of the restaurant for small parties, and large tables and chairs toward the back for larger parties.  The restaurant is on the small side though (-0.5). Unfortunately I did notice some of the tables, including ours, wasn't cleaned thoroughly and the floor had a sticky residue on it possibly indicating someone spilled soda prior (-0.5).  Menus - posted on a board above on the wall, and easy to read and comprehend.    Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming, including being greeted when we walked in, to also being asked how the food was when we were leaving.   Answered any questions we had about menu items, and even made suggestions which was welcomed by some in our party. I read from previous reviews that their bread can run out so I called ahead and asked about this.  The owner, I believe whom I spoke with, said it was true as they only have a certain number of bread on hand for the day.  He further explained, when it runs out, it's not like they can call the local bakery for more as they'll be closed.  He offered, by phone, to save a number of bread for me corresponding to the number of folks I was bringing which was really kind of him and was really appreciated.  Food - For me, I had the Original \"Philly\" Cheese Steak sandwich - 8'' (also comes in 12'') - layers of wafer thin steak, grilled with sautéed onions, their special red sauce, served on soft Italian steak roll, and made it a meal with their seasoned fries and a drink. Steak was cooked to perfection on their grills, and I like the fact that it's wafer thin (not chunky) as it allows for more to be packed into the bread.  Steak wasn't over oily/greasy, and even with their red sauce, it didn't make the bread soggy.   I think that's a huge mistake and oversight when creating a philly cheese steak sandwich - is giving the customer a soggy sandwich.  Who wants that? I can't remember what their red sauce consisted of, but when I inquired, was told that it gave the sandwich flavor - like a condiment, and it wasn't spicy at all but very tasty and flavorful. Onions were sautéed perfectly and wasn't overcooked or burnt.   The Italian bread roll was neither too hard nor too soft, but felt and tasted like it actually just came out of the oven - it tasted fresh! I expected the seasoned fries to taste seasoned as if it was supposed to have salt and pepper in it, but it looked like ordinary wedged shaped fries.  It still tasted good but it wasn't different in my opinion.  This place is a bit of a drive for me, coming from the West side of the valley, but I would definitely recommend if you're looking for an authentic philly cheese steak sandwich.  It definitely reminded me of what I've had back on the East coast."}
{"text":"Their cheesesteak is a must try of you are ever in the area.   Nothing fancy about the sandwich just a good soft roll, good cut of ribeye, and the perfect amount of cheese."}
{"text":"Best Philly in town, without a doubt. Extremely nice family owns the place and makes some great sandwiches. I've had phillys all over the east coast and this place matches some of the best I've had. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everyone was vary friendly and helpful! Food was fantastic! Love this place been there a few times and will continue to come back!!  You can not find a more friendly bunch of people!!"}
{"text":"The bellyfiller is my go to choice, but you honestly can't go wrong with anything here! The only con is sometimes they run out of their bread, so make sure to come in early or call your order in ahead of time"}
{"text":"I have seen the flyers for this restaurant many times and finally found them and gave them a try. I like Philly cheese steaks and its touted as this is THE place for authentic PHILLY cheese steaks.    The atmosphere is somewhat pub like, narrow seating available and I imagine seating may be a problem during the lunch hour.   I ordered their most popular item cheese steak and had it prepared Philly style with onions and red sauce. Now the 8 inch sandwich looked delicious but to be honest I really didn't enjoy the flavor of it. Could it be the red sauce, melted cheese or what? I am not sure, but my gut tells me literally not to try that sandwich again.   Aside from my bad tasty experience I would encourage all to give this place a try and I look forward to your reviews."}
{"text":"they make one heck of a philly!  i've eaten at all the philly places in the valley & this place is the best.  just tried the red sauce for the first time & so glad i did.  it added a teeny touch of heat & the texture made the sandwich that much better.  it takes them a bit of time to make it, but good food takes some time.  if that's a problem, then call ahead & order.   it's that simple.  and if you thought good customer service was dead?  well, it's not!  these girls are simply & genuinely the sweetest ever!  yum! yum! yum!"}
{"text":"Great cheese steaks and fries.   Really impressed with friendly service and quality food made in front of you.   Highly recommend.  Had 2 twelve inch sandwiches 2 fries and 2 large drinks for under 30 bucks so well worth the money"}
{"text":"I thought I'd check this place out for lunch after reading the reviews online and I was definitely not disappointed.  The Philly Cheese Steak (add wiz of course) was amazing, as were the seasoned fries.  If you are in the area, definitely worth checking out.  I only had a short lunch so I grabbed it to go and even though they were busy, I was ordered and out the door in less than 5 minutes.  I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.    Amazing Philly sandwiches.  The guy who cooks them rides a motorcycle and likes to sit down and chat with me about motorcycles when he gets the opportunity.  I haven't been here in awhile, but I've been itching to go back.  They could definitely do with a better drink machine, and some lemonade would be nice, but this is one of my favorite places to eat in Chandler.  It's definitely one of the best places for Philly Cheese Steaks"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The staffs are super friendly, very nice family owned business. They made their food with love."}
{"text":"I moved out to Chandler about 5 months ago, and randomly decided to give this place a try, after finding them on yelp. Fast forward about 5 months now....I think I've gone here a dozen times.   First, they're family owned, which is always nice when you're eating at a restaurant, because it's nice to support local family businesses.   Second, their Cheesesteaks are unreal.   Third, they have delicious Cheesesteaks.   Finally, did I mention their Cheesesteaks yet? Take my word for it and try it for yourself.   You won't regret it, you might even thank me later!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Delicious! I spent about 10.00 for the combo. I went with the mushroom pepper cheese steak, regular fries and a drink. We came right at 10am and everyone was super friendly! I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"It lives up the the hype! Rockin great Philly cheesesteak! Good fries too. Clean dining area with outstanding customer service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden gems you look for! We have had cheesesteak in Philly and two of the famous places there.  These guys blow them out of the water! The meat and toppings are always fresh and delicious. We have been here a lot and have never been disappointed. Make sure you stop buy and see this family we absolutely love them!! Oh and if you want some italian Ice it is delicious too!!"}
{"text":"YES! Best philly cheese steak I've had in the valley! The bread they use is soft and delicious, holds up to the delicious, amazing mess of glorious food on the inside. The cheese is always melty and gooey and just yes. And the meat, very plentiful and just yum! The sandwich is huge and very filling! The only thing is would improve on are the seasoned fries, I'm not really a fan of the wedges, and the time! Always seems like I'm craving their cheese steaks too late :( Either way, I'm all about it and tell everyone I know about this place!!"}
{"text":"I love cheesesteaks. Period. I think the cheesesteak is probably one of the best sub-sandwiches out there, and this place does it correctly.....you can almost see yourself in Philadelphia when you bite into one. Full of flavor and deliciousness in each bite. Locally owned, operated, and everything made to order. If you like extra meat or cheese, you can add it to your sandwich for a few bucks extra. Best of all, the family who runs the place are some of the nicest people you'll come across. :)"}
{"text":"Close to home and I'm a big philly fan. We called in the order and were asked how many sandwiches we needed and we said two. Apparently,  they were running low on bread and had we needed more we would have been turned down. Then we asked for the wedge cut fries and they were out of those as well. Starving and now craving Philly cheese steak, we ordered anyways. We took it to go and the food was very hot. Got home and it was still warm, to my surprise,  the fries were amazing and the italian philly I ordered was good. I got it with just meat and cheese. We would go back."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for your Cheesesteak fill. Awesome sandwiches that are packed with great ingredients on delicious bread. This family run place is like going to a friends for great eats. I always feel welcome and the family of owners couldn't be nicer. I wish my family could work this well together. If you like meat on your sandwich this is the place."}
{"text":"Lived next to this place for years and never tried it. I have been missing out! Philly's are killer better than I have had in Philadelphia. No kidding. Beyond that they are so nice. I mean treat you like family nice. Great diverse menu and all the Philly cheese steak fixins imaginable.  I'm hooked on the mushroom chicken steak with onions and whiz.   Try it out!  *btw - it says 'formal' attire.... this is NOT the case. What philly cheese steak place only serves you in a suit/tie. psh!"}
{"text":"Best and most authentic cheesesteak I promise this is as close as your gonna get to a real cheesesteak. Rita and eddy are the best at what they do and mark is super helpful with what to order, very nice people and very good food. I would say that I come to this place maybe 5 or 6 times a week and order a different kind of sand which everytime and I always enjoy them, wether is a cheesesteak eddy will hook you up for sure, or a hoagie (cold sandwich) Rita will make your life the best, and mark always has the best suggestions every single time. I'm an amazed of this place. 5 stars wish I could do a million but 5 will do."}
{"text":"These are the best philly cheesesteaks in Arizona. The next best are Forefathers, but either way you wont be disapointed. I know everyone that works here and they treat you like family. They are hard working and deserve our business! My tip is when they ask if you want red sauce, you say yes! Who the hell knows what red sauce is, but it adds something delish!"}
{"text":"Literally live 2 min walk away, and their philly sandwiches are very good.  Usually, a once a week treat for myself, my son, or both.   The reason for my review is more about the service.  Decided to go there for lunch on a school day.  I picked son up, and arrived with 26 minutes left to get him back.  So, how long does it take to get order in?   Just 4 minutes.  The problem came when it was time to get our sandwiches.  I watched as the person in front of us received their sandwiches, then they began making more.  I assumed ours since we were next, but no.  The 2 people making sandwiches made 4 sandwiches, and put them on tray only to hand them over to some guys who walked in well after us.   His explanation for taking 16 minutes to make our sandwiches was take the men were regulars ?! WTH ?!  Well, I hope those regulars keep coming, because I will not be back."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come get one of the best authentic Philly cheese steaks in AZ! It is refreshing to see this family run establishment put visible pride in their offerings. I enjoyed my experience immensely! This is my new spot"}
{"text":"When I am craving a sandwich then this is the place I always think to go. I have had cheesesteak from a number of the pizza and Italian joints within the area and most are alright but this is by far the most consistent and awesome sandwich spot in the Gilbert/Chandler area. Not only is it a local but what I like about it is that there is always a member of the family behind the counter either answering the phone or cooking the food; when I say local, family run is about as local as it gets!! Service-wise, I always call ahead because I'm eating on the run, it's always ready when I enter the room and they always try and make sure to ask about ketchup and any extras that I might need before I leave. The steak itself is well done and the peppers and onions are a must!!! I used to get wiz added but I have started taking whatever the menu recommends because the cheese they use is always soo good that I don't ever really need wiz!!! They actually put enough cheese that you can taste it instead of skimping you like some of the other joints in the vicinity!!! Cheese and Steak being spoken for, the last thing that I mention is the fact that the bread is on point!! They always use fresh rolls that are soft but not soggy; I hate when I get a steak and the roll just disintegrates in my hands because it's sopping wet. One of the last times that I came in, I was on the run (yet again) and the owner rang up my food and then offered me a piece of Baklava on the house. No, Baklava isn't on the menu but he just had some in the back and was giving away baklava to anyone who might appreciate a slice. This is the first time that I have ever felt this welcomed into a restaurant in my life; outside of the one that my parents used to own!!! All I can say is that if your on an empty stomach and having a bad day, this place will have you leaving with a full stomach and a smile!!"}
{"text":"The only place in town for authentic cheese steaks. I brought my friend here one time after a conversation about there not being a good local spot. After we ate he said he would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! I wanted to write something sarcastic about how \"bad\" it was so I could have more for me... but I can't even pretend to lie- I am incredibly full of amazing food at an extremely reasonable price! Thank you so much, Philly's Famous!"}
{"text":"Very very good cheesesteak, for AZ.  Amoroso roll (i.e. the BEST), very generous portion of meat and onions, cooked perfectly.  I only ever get onion and white american, they did not disappoint with this classic.  4 stars is based on a 5 being what you'd get at Tony Luke's.  They DO have a good selection of Tastykakes, so definitely points for paying homage to where it came from.  The owners are also very nice, making sure I knew what to get, making sure I was comfortable, making sure I was drinking filtered water.  Too bad they close at 8, I often find myself craving a cheesesteak this good a bit later in the evening.  But I will be back to Philly's Famous for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying, \"I have never had an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak before\". It's true, unfortunately. However I have tried a great deal of cheesesteaks over the years and have never once found one like the delicious offerings at Phillys Famous.   The passion that they clearly have for Philadelphia is apparent from the moment you walk in the door. The owner is extremely nice and talkative. He clearly knows his stuff when it comes to a good cheesesteak.   They have a great variety of different options (I always go for either the classic or the buffalo chicken) to choose from. My only complaint is the wedge fries..I would prefer the normal seasoned French fries, but I realize that's a personal taste so I will not let it influence my review.   For a reasonably priced and delicious lunch or dinner, you will have hard time finding a place that has cheesesteaks as delicious as these. The wait is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! How did I miss this place all these years I've been in Chandler? I'm now a regular. Love the cheesesteaks, and the warm hospitality from the family owners. If you love cheesesteaks, and like to support local family-run businesses, then you must give Philly's Famous a try, you'll likely become a regular too. Brak's coveted 25-star rating."}
{"text":"Very good cheesesteak.  All the ingredients were great. Only wish that they added a little more cheese as a standard. Best in Arizona so far....I'm no longer going to my usual spots for a Philly this is all you need"}
{"text":"Great sandwich, service was fast and was reasonably priced.  Came in after the normal lunch hour and did not have to wait at all. Got the mushroom pepper steak very good. Liked the way they diced the meat and the cheese melted just perfectly into everything.   Looks like I've found a new place to get cheese steak sandwiches. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheese steakes on the west coast, and the service can not be matched. This is a family run operation and they know how to make you feel like you're apart of their family. Don't miss the seasoned fries with ranch and Buffalo sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Philly with mushrooms and while it was good, there wasn't enough meat or filling in my hoagie. I also wanted the red sauce which would have been a great compliment to my sandwich but they ran out or said they couldn't give us any because they needed it for sandwiches. Umm ok?! So although my sandwich did not have enough filling, the hoagie roll was soft and the wedge potatoes were cooked perfect. I'll definitely give it another try but maybe not go close to closing when they may be running low on product."}
{"text":"This place has delicious sandwiches and a really friendly staff.  It's tucked away in a semi-abandoned strip mall on the NWC of Ray and Alma School (faces Alma School) flanked by a smoke shop and a payday loans place.  The line during lunch is always to the door but it moves pretty fast.  There is plenty of seating.   In the background is the continuous rhythm of the cook's spatula hitting the grill as he creates meat masterpieces one after another.   As the name implies, they make the sandwiches Philly style and everything I've had there has been delicious. I've had the Italian, the Philly Cheesesteak, the House (I forget the name) and on this visit I had the Pastrami.   I like me some toppings so no matter what I order I ask for tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and black olives on my sandwich if it doesn't already come with them.  On this particular visit, the cook asked me if I was sure I wanted all the extras on my sandwich because \"a real Philly Famous style pastrami only has meat, mustard, and pickles on it\".    I assured him that even though it was pure sandwich sacrilege I was OK breaking the Moral Code of the Philly's Famous Pastrami. I told him that I would repent of my sins later but right now I was super hungry.   Thankfully he didn't have anyone escort me out. Once he overcame his disappointment in me and returned to his glorious grill, he served up a wonderful sandwich, an original creation that would make Michelangelo proud!   I would recommend trying the seasoned fries there as well. For drinks, they have a Coke fountain dispenser along with iced tea and lemonade.   I've probably eaten here 8-10 times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So excited to write this review... Let me start by saying that my husband and I were born and raised in South Jersey, just outside of Philly. We have moved around a lot and are always searching for places like this to get a taste of home. While every place has fallen short, Philly's Famous nailed it! Everything we ordered was so delicious and exactly like you'd find on the east coast. We called to pre-order our food and it was ready exactly on time for pickup. The family who runs it are some of the nicest people I've met since moving to Phoenix. Each of them took the time to greet me and even offered me a free drink while I waited for them to pack the food up. This place is textbook \"mom & pop shop\" and I couldn't love it more... Well, my only wish is that it wasn't so far from my house!"}
{"text":"\"I rather eat like no one's watching than dance like no one's watching.\"  - Cristela Alonzo  I'm no cheese steak expert nor have I had an actual philly cheese steak from Philadelphia but I will say that this is a damn good sandwich.  It has everything I was looking for:  lots of meat, lots of cheese, and lots of flavor!  Great Friday night meal!  The beef is juicy, tender, and plentiful and the cheese helped glue everything together. I got the red sauce on the side since I wasn't sure what to expect but after trying it out, I will say that I'm definitely getting it on it next time.  One tiny cup just isn't enough!  That tomato sauce with oregano and other spices... Yum!  Mr. W. ran out of red sauce fast for his 12in. sandwich.  I had mine with no vegetables because I usually never finish my meal in one sitting and end up taking it home.  I figured the vegetables will fill me up too fast and I wanted to try to finish majority of it while it was still piping hot.  I will shamefully admit that I took down all 8-inches like a champ [that's what she said].  It was a feat that both impressed and scared Mr. W.  We also got our combos with the seasoned fries which were actually potato wedges.  Not bad or extraordinary but the star is definitely the sandwich with the red sauce.  This is a family-owned establishment and this is seriously the sweetest family ever.  I had a chance to talk with the boss-lady/mother and she was a delight!  The ambiance of the joint is super casual and the sound of metal cooking utensils banging on the flat-top stove only adds to the charm.  Ah, a place where I can eat like a pig and no one would judge me.  Also to note, they have this crazy drink called Barq's red creme soda.  I've never heard of it or had it before tonight and I can never go back to such ignorance!  And since it is a small family-owned place, the wait time can be pretty long since it's made to order but the wait is worth it.  EAT HERE, PEOPLE!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Italian Pepper Philly Cheese Steak with hot cherry peppers!    After making a mistake and leaving a review for Philly's Famous that should have been attributed to a similarly named restaurant (I removed once my erroneous review immediately when pointed out), I felt compelled by the actual great reviews for Philly's Famous to visit them and try their cheese steak. Not my usual rationale, and I also wouldn't generally drive 32 miles round trip for a cheese steak, but I realized it just might be worth it.  Arriving after navigating 16 miles of freeway from Scottsdale, I pulled up and parked in front of their unpretentious store front in Chandler Marketplace on the west side of Alma School, just north of Ray Road. It was about 11:35 am, and there were already about 10 cars parked there, and more coming, so I quickly made my way inside.   It isn't a very large place, and there were already 5 people in line ahead of me. It is a small place, with fairly limited seating, but it looked like I was ok in terms of finding a table. You order at the counter, and then take a seat (no table service) until they call out your name. As you walk in, there is a large menu showing lunch specials to your left, and a full menu is on the wall and overhead. I found those menus a little hard to interpret, but when I picked up one of their fliers from the end of the counter, I found that easier to follow.   With people ahead of me, I had a bit of time to consider the menu and determine which type of cheese steak to order. Although they make a chicken cheese steak (wafer thin sliced chicken), I really wanted to try the beef. After several moments consideration, I decided that I was going to order the Italian (provolone cheese instead of white American) Pepper (grilled with sweet bell peppers) Philly Cheese (grilled with sautéed onions) Steak minus the red sauce and with hot cherry peppers added.   By the time is I stepped up to order, my only question was if they actually had hot cherry peppers. The gentleman taking orders was very helpful, clarified which size I wanted (8\" or 12\") and assured me that they had the peppers I wanted. My 8\" sandwich plus a 24 oz drink, a pack of Tastycake Krimpets and sales tax totaled just over $11. Not a bad price for lunch and dessert.  Each sandwich is prepared to order - no overcooked pre-cooked piles of steak on the grill (Yeah!) so I filled my 24 oz cup with ginger ale (yes, ginger ale) from the fountain, picked a table and sat down to wait. From my new vantage point, I noticed that you can request larger portion sizes (meat, etc.) for an added fee. The line by this time was nearly out of the door.   Finally, my name was called and I went to the counter to pick up my sandwich. The Italian Steak roll was fresh, soft and chewy, with an average amount of filling. The sandwich was really good, although I think that the next time I'll have it with the red sauce for a little extra flavor. I was also pleased that my sandwich wasn't loaded with unnecessary oil.   Tables, seemed to turn just as they were needed, with no one standing around waiting for a place to sit. The order line backs up a bit during the lunch rush, but apparently not the seating. They seem to have the details worked out.  It wasn't a wasted 32 mile round trip at all! I left satisfied, and will be making the drive back again!"}
{"text":"Let me explain. There aren't many genuine Philly cheesesteak places in AZ, this is one that come close. There are only 2 in the valley I can do, the other is DeFalcos in Scottsdale. There's not enough cheese and meat inside for my personal taste. I'm still left a little hungry after 8 inches. Otherwise the overall taste is great! The employees are all pretty much family. They're Very friendly! However, wait time is tremendous. 15-25min for your food. Don't come in a rush.  The facility is ok. Nothing fancy. Could use a little more wiping down.  Overall, good place for a genuine Philly Cheesesteak"}
{"text":"OMG so delicious!  They are busy, so if you need a to-go order call ahead.  The service is fantastic!  Old school,  thank you for coming in, thank you for your order, have a great day!  Love the dedication to customer service.  Oh and cheese steak very good.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place.  The owners great everyone as they come through the door.  Place if full of regulars who know the food is great.  Nothing fancy but just good food at a good price.  Like everyone else said you need to have the red sauce."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a philly cheese steak and I have been here before so I thought I should stop in to see if it is consistant. Conclusion, yes it is! I didn't have to wait long 5-7 mins max and my name was called. I get it with onions and red sauce which I think gives it moisture, otherwise I would think it would be dry and tasteless.   Brought it back to the office and ate it all within 10 mins.  People there are really nice and friendly. I will come back here again and again :)"}
{"text":"I begin this review by saying that I was born and raised in Philly and lived there for over 30 years. Also let me state that I am a bit of a cheesesteak connoisseur. I've been to most of the places in Philadelphia that you hear about and many more that I'm sure you haven't. I find both Pat's and Geno's (the most popular places in Philly) to be more of a tourist's haunt for a decent taste of a Philly cheesesteak but certainly not the best.   In any event Philly's Famous prepares by far the best tasting cheesesteak and hoagie that I've found outside of the mid-atlantic region. You will be very hard pressed to find anything as tasty or authentic in this region of the world. If you live here in AZ and have never had a steak sammich' in Philly then this is without a doubt where you need to go. All of the other local places who boast about having a Philly cheesesteak (not mentioning any names but you know who they are) should have their mouths washed out wit' whiz. In the past every time I would go to one of those places and order a cheesesteak my wife would just shake her head (because she knew that she would have to listen to me complaining about it during and after the meal).   Best of all about Philly's Famous is that the folks who work there are terribly friendly and prepare your food with love and attention. A big plus in my book.   Finally, if this is your first time be sure to order your cheesesteak without \"gravy\" (red marinara sauce). In Philly, adding gravy is a variation on the classic cheesesteak known as a \"pizza steak\", which is a different beast. They seem to add gravy here by default.  As a last tidbit, here is my usual: A 12\" cheesesteak with fried onions, provolone (no whiz), salt, pepper, ketchup, no gravy and light mayo. That's how I've eaten my steaks for decades. Your choice may vary, but it's a fine starting point."}
{"text":"Went at about 1100 and half of Chandler was already there.  It's kind of a small place so when it's crowded, its crowded.  Even with a lot of orders it was pretty efficient in getting the food out.  As for the food (steak, onion, cheese, no sauce) it was pretty good.  Probably the best I've had but it's not like I eat a lot of cheese steaks so there may be better out there, but I'm not sure where you would get one (although I can tell you were to get a lot of mediocre ones).  Not a 5, but not a 4...probably a 4.5."}
{"text":"The best cheesesteak in town. The red sauce is a nice treat, the prices are affordable, and the menu options all tempting.  The staff is very friendly, and make you feel at home. I got the regular Philly to test out the place and will be coming back very soon to try the other options.   Good stuff."}
