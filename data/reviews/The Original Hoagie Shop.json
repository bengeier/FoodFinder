{"text":"This place was OK, a litle dirty like their AC vents above where the food is being prepped and made. Which to me is a no no. The food was ok, a little pricey I think. Staff friendly though."}
{"text":"I think this place is better known for its cheese steak but we didn't end up getting one. I got an Italian hoagie and the ingredients really were sub-par. I thought this place would be great considering the 4 star average but I was sadly disappointed.  Wouldn't return. Sorry! If the meat was of higher quality and they put more veggies on the subs I might consider."}
{"text":"I LOVE the broccoli cheese soup and my husband loves the sandwiches. Great little lunch place."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly.  I know a good cheesesteak when I see one.  This place is AWESOME!  Love the cheesesteaks here!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, the sandwiches are awesome def recommend the pastrami.com sandwich, fresh ingredients fresh cheese. The brownies are really good for those with a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"First, I want to say I want to support the small buinesses and I was really hoping to like this place.  That said, I would suggest to stay away from the spaghetti w/ meatball, the only good part was the meatball and it was still low end chef Boyardee at best. For $9 bucks you get garlic toast a bowl of saucy spaghetti and one large meatball, its not good. It has bland sauce with mushie pasta.  The garlic toast was also bland and over buttery soggy.  I have not tried their hoagies, so I dont have a comment on those, and maybe they are good, but if they are anything like this, then prepare your self for a bland meal.  This one went to the trash.  On the positive side the employees were friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I stopped in at 11 for take-out and got a cheese steak with bell peppers. 
The filling was great. The bread was soft.  Very tasty sandwich. Thank you."}
{"text":"Outstanding Cheese Steaks and the Pastrami.com is unbelievable !

Gets really busy at lunch, try a little earlier or later and they'll have you coming back to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is great to call in or drop by for pick up orders. You can eat there, it's just kind of small. No fancy frill's. Just good food & really nice staff! The steak & cheese is most peoples fav. They have many hot or cold Hoagies. The steak & cheese is piled high on a crispy outside but soft inside roll. They have half a cold hoagie & a cup of soup special everyday. The Italian is my fav. Soups range from clam chowder, to Ravioli with basil. There is a large menu that you wouldn't expect from a small place. Meatball hoagie is good too! 
AND they have REAL ice tea, not that fake crap out of a bottle!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the Philly CheeseSteak! This little gem is popular with the lunch crowd but quickly gets food out. My dad came here for years when he worked in the area and introduced me when I started working. Anytime I'm in the area for work this is my go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have yet to find a sandwich I don't like, the 'French dip, moms way' is my favorite but really everything is good."}
{"text":"When I say these cheesesteak reminds me of a Philly back home... I was very happy with the quality of the steak and the bread!  Grilled onions made the meal even more enjoyable. They got pretty swamped around lunchtime but the food was still done in about 5 minutes. They had a variety of choices and I can see myself going back often for a quick grab and go lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and even better sandwich. I had a philly cheese steak and it was awesome. I can't believe how fast it came out. The place is for sure a hole in the wall joint but check it out."}
{"text":"Being from Philadelphia, finding a good Italian Hoagie can be tough. This is the best I've found in the Phoenix area.

Finding the right bread is often difficult but they've done a good job here. The quality of meats and the service provided directly from the owner put this place as a must visit.

I usually have the Italian Hoagie but their cheese steaks and meatball subs are great as well."}
{"text":"Good food, consistently great service. They are fast and attentive here so make sure you examine the menu to get the best!"}
{"text":"First, I'm not a sandwich person (must still be shell-shocked from all those brown bags in high school).  The guy at super sign in the same shopping mall suggested I go there to grab a quick lunch. 

Waited in line too long to order. I an attempt to practice patience I decided to Zen and go with the flow. With order finally placed I waited and waited. The line grew steadily longer and still there was only one cashier and one prep person, or so it appeared.  I checked my email and Facebook and still no sandwich. Hmmm.  So much for grabbing a fast lunch. 

Get back to the office which is only 5 minutes away and dug in. Uck. The turkey was bland and the bread soggy. Not very appealing.  The ice tea was delightful though. :)

Maybe it's what I ordered or my basic instinct to not eat sandwiches but it's a thumbs down from me. Must say that the person taking orders was friendly and did his best. I wish he had help during busy lunch times."}
{"text":"This is Tempe's greatest kept lunch spot secret.  

The food is always super fresh and delicious.  The service is awesome and its family owned.  They also use a lot of local fresh food.  For example, they get their hoagies fresh daily from an Italian deli nearby.  And it's some of the best bread I've ever had.

I've tried everything on the menu and I've been a regular for several years.  If I had to recommend one thing on the menu it'd be the Italian Cheesesteak (add mayo, lettuce, tomato to make it 'hoagie style').  They grill that bad boy up fresh every time.  The soups are great too, my favorite is a tie between the Albondigas and Broccoli Cheese.  My wife enjoys the tuna or turkey.  You can't go wrong, check it out!"}
{"text":"Very good. Super busy for lunch like every shop on this little corner. Homemade soups and chili. Stop in for a quick bite.

5 stars due to excellent customer service.  A beef soup I bought contained no beef. If I'd been driving I would have turned around and had my cup of deliciousness replaced with something else but I wasn't so I called and the man (manager) that answered took down my name and said to stop in later for a refund or to try something else. Well sooner turned into later, but guess what!!!! They still had my name posted and I was able to try another dish plus I purchased another while there.

I try to stop in whenever I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place as I was picking up donuts for my staff at the Dunkin in the parking lot and just happened to be starving.  I got a french dip, mom's style, which comes on garlic bread with melted cheese.  That sandwich was legit!  They got the sandwich out pretty quickly and the guy at the register gave me a punch card (Tuesday is double stamp day).  Quick and easy and a great sandwich.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Revised Review:

I had to edit this review real quick.  Im sitting here at work, the other half of this cheese steak sitting here for a good 2 hours... I know, I'm gross... BUT, I just took a bite, and its actually better right now!  Maybe it was too hot when I first got it?  But the meat and onions are really flavorful and I MIGHT go back again... just to make my mind up :o)  Sorry, just had to add this.

Original Review:

Stephens turn to pick again, I think?  He's been raving about this place since we met so I finally gave in.  Im not much for subs (unless its Cheeba Hut, read my review) so its never really at the top of my list for lunch.  

So we drive over, its a little shop, I've seen it before, been to the liquor store next door I think?  Anyhoodle... I had to order the cheese steak cuz I couldn't go and NOT try it right?  It was done in a couple minutes.  It was pretty big, I tried to get a halfer, but they said No Can Do.  BOO!

So yeah, it was okay... kinda just simply meat, cheese, and bread.  2 Cheese steaks, 2 waters, and a bag of chips for 17 bucks?  I prolly wont go back.  Sorry Stephen :o(

So basically its my turn to pick next time, and I've already chosen another sub place... right up the street.... on Hardy... if you know what I'm meanin..."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. No bathroom. I was surprised I haven't been here considering I work right up the street. It reminds me of like an old school sub shop. Must be a local business as well because it has the feel of a more comfortable environment for me. Not much to say or see, it's just a good sub."}
{"text":"i eat here quite often
love the champ with mayo and mustard"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment for almost 20 years.  Locally and family owned and operated.  Nicest people in the world.  They care for the right reasons, they remember you and your regular order and they make great food.  I can't believe I'm just now writing a review.  Don't expect anything fancy-just a straight forward and amazingly tasty sandwich with quality ingredients.  They have, hands down, they best Italian hoagie in the Valley.  They will make any of the sandwiches in salad form as well."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as it's name led me to believe that I would be served a heaping traditional hoagie. However, I think what the place means by \"original\" is a hoagie long after it was filled with fresh and delicious foods, yet before it was expanded upon by places like Subway.

The tuna hoagie I received was made on a white bread roll no different from one I could get at a Safeway and was filled with the same type of tuna salad, chopped lettuce, and no-taste cheese you get at Subway only with none of the varied add-ons that make Subway doable.  

So, if you're looking for a pre-corporate but post-interesting hoagie like many of the middle-aged people on lunch break here, I guess you've found the place for you, but there are many better sandwich places nearby. It's rare that I prefer a chain over a local place, but Original Hoagie makes an exception to the rule."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a couple coworkers and was satisfied with the food and the service. I had the chicken bacon ranch. It was good but they have other menu options I would also like to try. The place was clean and it didn't take long to get our food. I'll be coming back to try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"My sandwich was pretty decently priced. Good quality meat. It wasnt busy, so I got in and out very fast.

My only 2 complaints: My lettuce was white and brown. Not appetizing at all.
 That, and I asked for them to go \"easy on the mayo\", which apparently meant to slop it on so that it literally drips, huge drops of mayo, out of the bottom while being eaten.

Meh. There are much better sandwich places in the same area."}
{"text":"Was in the area, and I'm more into supporting local shops than chain. Read a couple of reviews and they seemed fair enough to give it a try. Got the steak sandwich with provolone and mushrooms. Was okay, not much flavor in the meat. I will add as well this place is a bit pricey for what you get , $11.00 for a full sub and a drink is kinda high. Over all it was good, I'd say the best was the bread, soft and fresh can't ever go wrong with that. Would I return, probably not, if they adjust the prices and have more lunch specials that are worth the travel then I probably say I would come back and try many other subs.  At least a daily special from 11-2, maybe $7-8 bucks for a 6 inch, soup and a med drink. I'm sure my one review is not gonna gear people away from coming, but if your on a budget this review might be helpful.

\"Focker Out!\""}
{"text":"I am a sandwich Connoisseur. I could eat them all day everyday. 
And when it's lunch time and I'm at work, The OG Hoagie Shop is my spot. 
Try their French Dip (mom's way) you'll never go back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Philly cheesesteak I've had in ten years. Excellent customer service too. I enjoyed every bite of an Italian cheesesteak-add pepperoni-no onions-provolone-Mom's way with light mayo. Every single bite was scrumptious. IMO: Stop reading and go get to the eating!!! :-)"}
{"text":"I had to run out of the office to fill my gas tank and across the street was The Original Hoagie Shop. I decided to give them a try since it was convenient. I even quickly checked their Yelp rating and saw the 4 star rating, so I felt it was a safe bet.

The place was quite small and a bit dingy feeling. I didn't smell anything, which was surprising. I guess I was expecting to smell either baked bread, or the spices from the different hot sandwiches they offer, or something. I wanted to leave but felt I didn't have much time to go elsewhere so I stayed and ordered the cheese steak sandwich. Most places that offer cheese steak sandwiches usually have onions so I was surprised to find out I would need to add them on. I paid and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally! I got my sandwich and I headed back to work since I was running behind now.

When I got back to work is when I realized they charged me extra for mushrooms but they didn't bother to let me know there would be an up charge for it. The total came to $8.18, I thought whatever, as long as it tastes good I'll be fine with it. 
I was very disappointed. The sandwich was absolutely flavorless! No tomato, or lettuce, no mayo, or malt vinegar, nothing was on it. It was just cooked chopped meat, with a little bit of onions, a few mushrooms pieces, and some cheese. This was not worth the money, not even close. I am so disappointed I wasted my money...

I definitely won't be back, I didn't think it was worth the $8 bucks by any means. I would suggest going to Forefather's Cheese Steaks off of Priest and Warner. They're flavorful, they have lots of options to choose from, very clean place with happy staff. For the price I paid for JUST a sandwich by itself I could have gotten a sandwich, fries, and a drink at Forefathers. How sad is that!?"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Simple, delicious sandwiches, locally owned, great customer service, great prices. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love me some good sandwiches, and this place has em. Small, family owned joint - it's easy to become a regular here - just go a few times and they'll treat you like one. Super friendly and nice here. 

The food is fantastic. They use quality ingredients and cut the meat to order. Most places don't do this. The prices are low, and the food is good. The ambiance isn't fancy, but it's clean and quaint. 

The Original Hoagie Shop has been here for awhile now I think, and it's a great alternative to the chain across the street. You're missing out if you haven't made this your go-to when you want a sub. 

I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place continues to rock! Tom and his staff are super friendly and they truly appreciate your business. If you haven't stopped by this quaint little sub shop yet, I'd highly recommend it. They have quite a few regulars and seem to be as busy as ever."}
{"text":"Another day, another lunch in Tempe with a coworker.

Never eaten here until today, after almost 9 years in the area.  How does that happen?  Maybe because there are about 50 sandwich shops in 4 square miles.

Regardless, needed a quick bite and was worried that other places were too busy.

Meatball sub was tasty.  Homemade sauce and meatballs.  Cashier (owner?) was friendly and quick to answer any questions about the menu and favorites..

Give it a try.  I'll go back for the cheese steak soon."}
{"text":"eh,, Its ok. 
Great staff, and the ingredients fresh, good bread... Not a provolone or mozzarella guy and like a variety on my samiches,, especially SWISS or Cheddar. The price seemed a little high for the amount of samich,, 

Nice try for a new spot, but doesn't fit into my rotation on any level.."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Bill was great and very funny, but yet professional. I got the seafood crab sandwich, it wasn't amazing but was good. I will go back and try more Hoagies on the menu."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak is a little dry. Good meat and decent bread. Old guy behind counter was dry like the sandwich. Kind of came off as a prick. Maybe having a bad day. Unfortunately he did it to a yelp reviewer. Be nice to everyone, you never know."}
{"text":"First time trying this place not to happy. I ordered the Italian cheese stake and they gave me a Philly cheese stake! There was no line and only a couple people sitting at tables. So I don't know how they could of made the mistake of giving me the wrong sandwich. I was the only one waiting! I don't know what they are doing in the the kitchen. But they must smoking to much dope! Make sure you check what kind of sandwich you get before you leave the place."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, this place is awesome.  Frigging awesome.

Since I work close to here, I typically have a lot of the same crappy ass options for lunch that I get sick of.  Original Hoagie challenges these crappy options and comes out the victorious winner, like Tom Berringer in the Movie \"Sniper\", when he knows he just owned his enemy.  I would come to this place more than once a week if I made more money than I do.  It is just one of those places.  

I will give this place my official N.F.A. rating (no fucking around)

Here is my typical experience when I come here.  Now, I have tried about 5-7 things off the menu here in my 100 visits or so and they are all awesome.  Fresh ingredients, lettuce doesn't taste like water, meat doesn't taste like Carl Budding, soft bread (god the bread here...damn...) and kick ass service.  My \"regular\" item takes a few minutes longer than the typical sub.  The owner sees me in line, has them start making it before I even order it so I don't have to wait as long. 

A-fucking plus.    

Let's talk about the owner, shall we (I assume, might be the manager, not sure but he is always running the cash register)  This guy is awesome.  And I hate people.  He always asks how my days is going, making small talk, etc.  If I haven't been in for a while, he says things like \"been a while since I have seen you!\" \"how have you been?\" \"Come back more often!\"  He is the guy taking orders every time I have been there.  Since I am not a huge fan of soda, he always gives me a good size ice water and doesn't bitch about it or charge me for a cup.  That charging for a cup thing is horse shit and non-existent at this place.

By the way, no fee for using a debit/credit card either.  I almost always use cash, but a plus for you card users.

The restaurant is always clean.  Tables are free of garbage and left over food.  They always have the daily newspaper to read and I have never been pushed out of there if I read it after my meal is over.  The place doesn't smell of burned bread or rotten meat either, like a lot of other sandwich shops.

If I had to make a complaint it would be that there is no bathroom here for customers.  The place is small and probably lacks the resources for it.  Plus I bet it would piss off the health department if they knew customers were walking through the food prep area to wash their hands which is why it doesn't happen.  Know this before going there and piss/shit and wash your hands beforehand and the bullet has been dodged.  If these instructions are too hard for you, then I assume natural selection will eventually pay you a visit anyway.  I look for any way to cut down a business and with this place I really can't find one.  Can't ding a star for their shitter (or lack of) 

If you are in the area and want a good meal, decent price (about 1-2 bucks more than the crappy national chains but after you eat you know where that money went) and good quick service, than give this place a try.  I found it by accident a few years ago and it was one of the best fuck up's I have had from a food point of view.  

You are clear to engage the Original Hoagie Shop.  Weapons hot."}
