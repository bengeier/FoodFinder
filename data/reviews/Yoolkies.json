{"text":"Meh, went for breakfast with the kids... first and foremost I dislike the decor... it's cold. Service was hit and miss but wtv it's breakfast. Now the food. Eggs were under cooked, bacon and the potatoes are underwhelming. One of the most important part to me are the potatoes, they add a little Indian touch to them, not bad, but not quite there... and we had 2 hairs in one plate. Unfortunately I won't be visiting this place anymore. If you ask me, you can skip this one..."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. got seated and proceeded to wait 40 min for any waiter to pass by. 2 others table that arrived after us got served first. Will never go there ever again ... stay away"}
{"text":"This place took over the location of Dejeneur Inc and is now a breakfast & brunch place with a little Indian twist.

Food is good but service was a little slow. Can't blame them since it just opened. Will try them again in a few weeks."}
