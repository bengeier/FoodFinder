{"text":"To be honest, this place was really underwhelming and actually we didn't like the food at all. I know ghee is trending right now; but everything is doused in it. All I could taste was butter. Was actually kinda gross. Love the staff and the decor; service was outstanding. Unfortunately the food let them down. At the heart of this restaurant; there needs to be an awareness that this is an Indian food restaurant and that's been lost in GHEE primarily but also trying to get too fancy and quirky. Portions are very small. And, where are the curries?! Not enough to choose from and the one we did try was pork (?) and no where near enough yummy sauce for mopping up with Naan. Sorry to say; disappointing."}
{"text":"One star for the decor and one for the cool drinks. The wait was long but the biggest turn off was the tiny portion sizes and high prices. At authentic Indian restaurants I leave feeling like I can't eat again for 1000 days but at CCC I felt like I just nibbled on some mediocre curry. I wish this place had food that was exciting and fairly priced because it is a fun ambience in there. I wouldn't go back, I'd rather drive to Raj's Palace and have my tastebuds rocked and my tummy full."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food is extremely spicy now. Portions are still very small for the price. Kala chana is replaced with regular chana in the gol gappa, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Decor is really nice, that's the only thing good to say.  The cocktails sub-par.  The service was horrible. Rude to the women at our table.  Not helpful.  I went to pay for two drinks and the waitress handed me the visa machine and said that will be $45 she added the tip and tax for me.  The two drinks we had were basic cocktails.  She totally ripped us off!  She kept calling the girls at the table baby girl in a rude tone.  Asked for a coffee and was told to go down the street.  The A/C vent over our table was on while it was -7 outside asked if they could turn it down and they said no, but that she would get us all blankets and never did."}
{"text":"While the CCC may not have the most authentic Indian food, it fills its niche on 17th perfectly.   The bar is large, the place packed, and the energy level is turned way up. Service is more than attentive and the well priced food complements the cocktails perfectly.  The manager overlooks the process, head swiveling, making sure this well tooled machine runs well. With an uplifting, bright, British Raj decor, cool patio, lots of eye candy, the Calcutta Cricket Club is simply \"perfect,\" (the word of the year), if never excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambience and food here.  However, this is not a traditional Indian restaurant. I would say the food is a contemporary version of Indian food with a chefs artistic license. If you want filling large portions this is not the place for you. If you are looking for fun new takes on Indian staples with creative cocktails this is he place for you. Planning on coming here on the weekend?  Come early or expect to wait for up to an hour unless you don't mind the bar.   I look forward to returning and trying the dishes I didn't get a chance to sample. I recommend the Phuchkas, Kati Rolls, and the Gundpowder Broccolini."}
{"text":"Was excited then was disappointed... Expensive for what you get... Portions were quite small for the price. We are actually happy to pay more if delicious and worth it but couldn't justify it here. Flavours were mellow but fell short and left us wanting more? I love Indian food and didn't expect it to be truly authentic but was wanting that punch of delicious Indian spices. It seemed to be scaled back to appeal to everyone. We shared the phuchkas (decent), lamb keema Kati (flakey bread was tasty and small but best part of meal), chicken tikka (small 3 pieces), pork butter marsala (like a decent butter chicken), garlic naan (not bad) and basmati with glee (greasy and maybe not fully cooked through). Loved the restaurant decor however and service was pretty good. Likely won't return though."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and atmosphere of the place. Food left a little to be desired - it was nothing amazing and the portions seemed small for the price. The cocktails we had were great. I would definitely go back for drinks but it won't be top of my list to return for the food. As well, it was very loud in there! Hard to hear across the table or even the server."}
{"text":"I was eager to check out the posh decor and carousel leopard over the bar. Our first server abandoned us entirely. Other tables were observed to have a variety of dishes surrounding a group serving of rice, etc. Our dishes rolled out randomly one or two at a time. Rice and naan did not arrive until half way through our meal. Some dishes arrived to our table very late. The last dish delivered - chicken, potato, yogurt - was the least attractive item I've ever seen presented in a restaurant. Truth. The cocktail menu was inviting, but the drinks were poorly mixed. Employees lingered long and chatted in open doorway to staff area and before stomping out in street clothes. Very dusty. Throw pillows might have feathers."}
{"text":"Wish the portion sizes matched the pricing. But it'd expected here in Calgary where customers are forced to pay ridiculous amounts for food. Ugh"}
{"text":"Please try the happy hour between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. All the bar snacks are 50% off!!!"}
{"text":"Indian food but only two options for vegetarian. 
It was super busy the day we visited and hence the service was pathethic ( may be it was just our table)"}
{"text":"Loved everything about it (except bathroom is bland comparably even tho drop gold trim ceiling is an attempt).  Food was fantastic.  As a new place, staff is friendly and loving life.  As they stumbled as they learn, they were sweet to explain and apologize.  It's so stunning, the decor.  Patio is awesome.  And everything we tried was excellent.  Even a cob of corn better than anything I've ever had.  Love this restaurant group.  Have the next opening on my calendar for Two Penny!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, unfriendly service, nice ambience.

We sampled quite a few dishes. All flavours were toned down, nothing really stood out food-wise. On the plus side, they have a nice selection of draft beers, mostly local and BC. The decor is nice. Music, though, is a bit too loud, something i have found even at other sister restaurants like Native Tongue. I probably won't be going here again."}
{"text":"I ate here a while ago and added many photos of what I ate. Needless to say it was delicious. However, deliciousness does come with a price and this deliciousness was a little more expensive then I like to pay. However, the reason this place is getting such a good rating is because of the decor. 
If anywhere gets an award for best decor or 5 stars only for decor it is only this place! 
I was reading the spring/summer 2018 edition of dote magazine today and I finally found out where the decor came from that I had to share: \" Designed and conceptualizer by artist Maya Gohill, Calcutta Cricket Club has presented authentic Bengali cuisine to Calgary in a fresh and innovative way.  The vibrant interior evokes a nostalgic feeling reminiscent of a Wee Anderson film, with soft pinks, unique textures, and a ferocious leopard hung over the awe-inspiring bar.\" 
This sums it up well :)"}
{"text":"Love the place and love the food.
THEY HAVE TO FIX THE NO RESERVATION POLICY !
My time is valuable, I should be able to book a time and spend my money $$ on what is very expensive food (which I don't mind). But I don't think any restaurant should be so high on them selfs that they can make people willing to spend a lot of money $ and make anyone wait 1 to 2 hours to get a table. There are restaurants better than this and I can walk in with my reservation and spend a lot of money. I may not be back until they change the policy.
Also, I am a business man. If things are so good why wouldn't you open for lunch ? I guess the owners don't need the business, they must be almost retired or this is just a hobby. Just saying."}
{"text":"Great decor, food is amazing, especially the Railroad Chai tea. It did take a bit of time to get our bill though. We were a party of 8."}
{"text":"So much talk and hype around this place that I had to check it out. I have to say it did not live up to all the hype. Good decor and a very nice pretty ppl crowd but beyond that not much to it. Food lacked depth in its flavor. Kati rolls weren't too bad but so disappointed with their biryani. I have been lucky and have had the opportunity to try various diff biryani from India, Pakistan, Afgan, Kurdish... I was impressed with the presentation with its puff pastry shell. So this is a short rib Biryani but there was only 3 beef pieces so some one please tell me how it justifies a $33 price tag. I felt ripped off snd angry. On top of that when I told them the dish lacked depth of flavor they had no response. So to sum it up and to borrow words of another reviewer from here: 

\"Would I come back? Probably not. Would I recommend it as a place for Indian food? Most definitely not. Would I recommend it to someone with $$$ to spend and looking for a hip place to hang out with little regard for authentic Indian food? Absolutely.\"
\""}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, nice location. Had the lamb kebabs as an appetizer. The biryani sounded great on the menu and the presentation was nice, but very bland, and pricey at $33 for one dish! Small portion sizes, very bland food, and pricey."}
{"text":"Awesome environment inside. Very busy restaurant. I took a kathi roll and chicken tikka, both were delicious. They have a Bengali tinge in their food. Recommend this place to everyone. I will definitely visit again if I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is unique and the ambience and the decor (the jaguar, old posters of cricketers) would make it your top choice to visit the restaurant. However, as compared to the other Indian (British?) restaurants, the portions are small and the food is pricey. From the bar snacks, I liked the Paneer & Honey which I thought was some creativity from the Chef. If you decide on the Chutney Taster from the bar snacks, make sure you order the Kati rolls. Usually, I have seen more thicker rolls but these ones are also nice as appetizers. The drinks menu is nice and I tried the Turmeric Gimlet - a mix of British Gin and Turmeric Cordial which I really liked. Based on Yelp reviews, I did notice that they don't have a no reservation policy.  BTW, my buddy and I went in early and inspite of having many tables (for more than 2 individuals) free, they asked us to sit next to the bar. We were okay with it but I personally thought that it was not a good customer service attitude (is maximizing table occupancy the sole goal?). The place is popular and will earn its name in Calgary for the cool decor and the reasonably good food."}
{"text":"Holy cute decor! So sad, my phone wasn't co-operating and I couldn't get any pics, too many foodie pics, not enough storage space! Stopped in for a drink and some apps, the chili chicken, and paneer were so good. I'm no expert on what makes for proper Indian food, but it was definitely tasty. The decor is delightful and they have a really good soundtrack playing that you can also find on Spotify if you want to keep the vibe going after you leave. Just tried a few items so I'm looking forward to going back again for a full dinner."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday evening with a group of four on a friends recommendation. We were seated promptly without a reservation even though the restaurant was fairly busy. Good atmosphere and cute decor. It's clearly an Indian restaurant however I didn't see a single Indian person. The food was decent but nothing to write home about and in my opinion pretty overpriced. They charge you $2 per person for rice and brought one tiny bowl for the four of us to share. When we asked for more rice as we were eating, we could see our waiter in the kitchen waiting on our second small bowl. After about 20 minutes of picking at our remaining food and our waiter not coming to check on us, we signalled over another waitress and asked for her to cancel the rice as we were done our meal. I've eaten at a plethora of Indian restaurants and this one was underwhelming. The curries are really quite small, definitely would not recommend sharing one even if you get plenty of appetizers and sides. If you want to pop in for a drink on 17th, it's a cute place but skip the dinner."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this restaurant because I had seen the pretty decor and the food on their Instagram page so I suggested it to my friends. Notably, they have their food based on items from Calcutta and Indian street food which seemed like a cool restaurant theme. Also, they had pictures of a plastic jaguar as a centrepiece for their restaurant on Instagram and it just looked so cool I had to go check it out! 

We got their at 7 pm and put our names on the wait list for a table. They notified us that it would take anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half for us to be seated because they had shut down the patio (which takes their seat count down by about half) and also had a lot of people waiting ahead of us. They said that they would text us when they had a seat become available so this allowed us to wander around 17 th ave in the meantime. 

An hour and a half passes by with no text message so we call them to follow up. They said that because there's been only a small number of tables turning over the wait time has been delayed to a half an hour to an hour longer. We were upset to hear that but having already waited for this long, we thought that we could last a while longer. An hour later - no text message. So we decide to stroll back into the restaurant to see what's going on. The hostess is very apologetic and states that people have been sticking around after eating and not leaving their tables all night. She points to one table and states that the people there have been there since 5 pm and it is now 930 pm! She says that she's going to try her best to walk around and get a table free for us. She offered us some chai tea to help make the wait better for us which was great because I was about to pass out.

Finally we get seated on a 2 person table with a chair added in at around 10pm. We already know what we want to eat so we order right away. We wanted to try the tandoori chicken Kati rolls, Parsi prawn curry and the beef short rib biryani. At that point the server told us that the biryani would take a half hour to make which wasn't a surprise at this point haha so we ordered it anyway! We asked that he brings out all the food together instead of separately so that we could eat the curry with the biryani to which he said no because he needs to bring out the curry first! Why does he need to bring out the curry first exactly?! This meant that we would need to order either naan or plain rice to accompany the curry which we ended up doing but I knew that it was going to be a lot of food for us to finish. A lot of restaurants are accommodating about the order they bring out food but this one is definitely not one of them! 

The food comes out with the entree for one of my friends first and a half hour later the server comes by to notice that our appetizers have not even been served yet. He chalks it up to the kitchen messing up on our order because he definitely put the order in. Our appetizer arrives 10 minutes later after one of my friends has finished eating, followed by the curry and a grand total of an hour later- the biryani! 

After all of this, I wish I could say that the food was totally worth it but I sadly cannot. The food was good - the Kati rolls had flavourful and soft chicken with cilantro wrapped in parotha ($7 for one). The Parsi prawn curry had fresh prawns but was a bit too salty ($14) and the short rib biryani had really soft meat with flavourful rice in a bowl covered with puff pastry covering ($33). 

Overall, this half day excursion for food was the biggest waste of my time. I could have driven to Banff, eaten there and travelled back in the amount of time it took for us to eat here. I would not be going back to this restaurant again - their food is good but not worth the wait or the terrible service! As for the jaguar - yes you are cool but definitely not worth the 4.5 hours I spent in hanger at this restaurant! Would NOT recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprising find. Hadn't heard of this place until a friend suggested we try it out. Gorgeous interior, amazing service and food was divine. Every single item we tried was aromatic and beautifully seasoned. It was Indian food like I've never had before. The Kati rolls were delicious, thoroughly enjoyed the fish chop appetizer and prawn curry was outstanding. A fun place to dine and share plates. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In one word - EXCELLENT. The food, the drinks (cocktails), the decor, ambiance, the service. Top notch. Reminded me of quintessential Calcutta flavors for the first time in North America. The railway chai, thumbs up and mishti doi - nice touch.  Infinitely excited about the place. And love the name too."}
{"text":"Calcutta Cricket Club came out of nowhere. The second restaurant to open by the same owners as Native Tongues Taqueria, triple C specializes in Bengali food. This may be the first foray into making Indian food hipster. 

We decided to check this place out on a Friday night around 7:00pm. No reservations. They have a patio outside that's gorgeous. The inside colour scheme reminded me of a watermelon (green booth seats with pink chairs and walls).

Service was friendly but all over the place. She brought us out incorrect drinks, offered free chai (never came) and forgot about our fish dish because we finished our whole meal then waited a half hour for it to finally arrive. Yikes.

- 3x Banded Peak's Mango passion saison ($7.00 10oz) - never had Banded Peak before so we gave it a shot. Pretty good but I get why they only give you 10oz.
- Dandy's Bright Young Things: English Summer Ale ($7.00 for 16oz) - this one was more drinkable.
- Mocktail ($4.00) - S hated it. He couldn't even finish half of it.
- Railway station chai ($3.50) - this was actually good. Steeped with milk, sugar, cardamom, ginger and clove. Totally overpriced. If they're going to charge this much, you should be getting unlimited refills. 
- 5x Garlic naan ($3.50) - I didn't taste any garlic. We originally ordered three but then ordered two more for some other items that didn't show up till late. By that time, the naan was cold. 
- Basmati ($3.50) - small portion for the price. Not much taste either. 
- Papri chaat ($7.00) - Semolina crisps, spiced potatoes, yogurt, onions, chickpeas, mint, tamarind, chaat masala, sev & pomegranate. This was really bland.
- Paneer kati roll ($8.00) - fresh cheese served with lime, onions, chat masala, green chills and Maggi hot & sweet sauce. S got it with egg ($2.00). He liked this dish best out of the three vegetarian ones he ordered.
- 2x Paneer & honey ($6.00) - seasoned and seared with Bengali garam and kashmiri chili. Topped with local honey and pistachios. To us, it tasted like cinnamon. Boring and unmemorable. 
- 3x Bhutta ($5.00) - roasted anything is good. Roasted corn is the best. The lime with salt and chili powder was tantalizing. 
- Seekh kebab ($10.00) - ground pork and blend of spices.
- Parsi prawns ($14.00) - prawns in coconut curry with cumin and cilantro.
- Boti kebab ($12.00) - lamb marinated in yogurt, spices and served with mint raita.
- Chicken rezala ($15.00) - white curry with whole aromatic spices, yogurt, cashew, poppy seed and saffron.
- Doi begun ($11.00) - eggplant with yogurt, tomato and mustard oil.
- Bison biryani ($35.00) - basmati rice, potatoes, currants and served with raita. The presentation is unique as it's served in the traditional 'sum' style. Interestingly, they've changed it on their menu and it's now beef short rib ($30.00).
- Paturi ($15.00) - tandoor roasted fish. Apparently, it's straight from India. It came whole with bones and all included. Lightly fried but they overcooked it and it was devastatingly bland.

Don't come here for the food. The portions are small and not worth the price point. For a drink or date, the bar and outdoor patio are perfect."}
{"text":"Oh my. 
Nailed it:
The food. The drinks (very cold beer). The decor. The atmosphere. The service.
Katie Rolls, Chile Chicken, Naan the best I've ever had. Curry Veggies.
Huge side patio heated, small one out front but inside comfy chairs and banquets."}
{"text":"If there is one thing history has taught us, it's that coercive reform never works. Take CCC's namesake for example. Anglicized from Kolkata to Calcutta during British colonial rule, the entangled history of Bengals' rejection of English social reforms continue to present day history with renamed streets and Calcutta rechristened as Kolkata.  

You might ask, what does this have to do with CCC as a restaurant? Well, it exemplifies the notion of how CCC's attempt at Westernizing Indian cuisine like reformation under colonial constraints just doesn't work. Between the four of us, we ordered the chili chicken, chicken kati roll, paneer roll, parsi prawn, doi begun and the lamb shank. While everything was certainly palatable, it lacked the depth and flavor I'm accustomed to at other Indian restaurants or Indian friends cooking. The best dish was probably the chili chicken but, many big box chain restaurants also accomplish this dish very well. The paratha in the kati rolls was good but the ingredients within, relatively basic and didn't wow. Perhaps one of the most disappointing dishes was the parsi prawn. At an incredibly small serving of about 4-5 prawns, I don't even know if I can truly call this a curry because it lacked so much in flavor and spice (although the prawns were well cooked), that by Indian curry standards it was tasteless. Next was the lamb and the doi begun which was also underwhelming and much too mellow. Don't get me wrong, I understand creative food and innovative chef's always put a spin on making dishes their own. But, I can't appreciate when the best part of certain dishes is missed. Innovation is about taking the best of something and expanding on it, not stripping it down so that it is a ghost of what it once was. Food aside, the decor of CCC is actually very pretty - although erring along the lines of colonial India than nationalist India - and the service was fantastic. 

Would I come back? Probably not. Would I recommend it as a place for Indian food? Most definitely not. Would I recommend it to someone with $$$ to spend and looking for a hip place to hang out with little regard for authentic Indian food? Absolutely.

**My friends who dined with me just reminded me of the following points: We also had the gunpowder brocollini and It was one of the few wins but drenched in an unnecessary amount of ghee;  all of the dishes were overly sweet and served just barely lukewarm; the server who did a fantastic job at addressing allergies failed to bring the complimentary bar dish; and while the allergies were addressed, I'm sure there was some slight misinformation since my stomach hurt terribly that evening."}
{"text":"Okay we loved this place so much we went twice in the same weekend for brunch and dinner!

Great, unique design- think vintage India in the 60's.

Food is Indian with a modern and thoughtful twist. This isn't your mom's Indian restaurant (and that's a good thing lol!)

Brunch- We tried and loved the Ovaltine and chai pancakes, chips and curry (!), tandoori fried chicken, and parsi eggs. Drinks: pineapple mimosa and Rickys love letter, two thumbs up. 

Dinner: loved the kati rolls ($5 on Sunday) and chicken rezala curry. Cool vibe in the evenings. 

Also charming: the chef naming his aunties as inspiration on the menu."}
{"text":"Not my jam. Busy, hard to get into for no apparent reason aside from its new, loud, weirdly decorated (although the side patio is nice) and the food was just meh. Portion sizes are small while prices are premium. The service, however, was good! Sticking with Moti Mahal and Raj Doot for my Indian options."}
{"text":"Calcutta Cricket Club (CCC) is one of the newest additions to trendy 17th avenue and a sister restaurant to Native Tongues Taqueria. Though, they serve Indian cuisine and according to Instagram, the food and interior look amazing! My gfs and I were looking for a place to eat when Tiff suggested CCC. I've heard of them and when I found out they served Indian food, I was totally sold. We arrived just after 7PM on a Saturday and the place was bumpin'. There was a wait list and we were told that our table would be ready in ~30 minutes so we put my name down and went over to Ship & Anchor for some drinks to hold us over - the hostess took my number so I would receive a text message once our table was ready.

Sure enough, about a half hour later I received a text and we headed over. There seem to be more people waiting around for tables so we were happy to be seated. The space is really colorful, bright green and pink walls with a black and white checkered floor. Pink chairs, green booths, goldish bar stools. They also have a small front patio that overlooks 17th Avenue (~10 seats) as well as a more secluded and bigger patio along the east side of the restaurant. But we were seated inside near the middle in the pink chairs. There Our server was good, she poured us water right away and told us about the menu. We asked what the favorites were and she mentioned Kati rolls for appetizers and then the lamb and pork dish for main. We decided to go with one kati roll each, we ordered two lamb and one paneer. Kati rolls is meats or paneer wrapped in fresh flaky paratha (flat bread), I had the paneeer: fresh cheese with some cilantro, lime, onions, chaat masala, green chilis and some hot and sweet sauce. T & M really seemed to enjoy their lamb kati rolls and I really liked the paneer, it was super flavorful and the cheese was nice and soft, cilantro brought a freshness. As the dishes are meant to be shared, we ordered Parsi Prawn, Pork Butter Masala, and Chicken Tikka with two orders of naan bread and an order of rice.

Food came, we were hungry as per usual so we dug in asap, after I snapped a picture of course ;) In my humble opinion, all the dishes looked small. The curry prawn dish was nice, spices were fragrant -  there were maybe 6 prawns in the dish, the cumin and cilantro was noticable and the curry was a good consistency. The pork dish was a tandoor roasted pork dish with tandoori curry sauce, same great consistency as the prawn sauce - thick enough to hang on to the rice and naan. The chicken tikka wasn't a favorite. The thighs were roasted with fenugreek (plant) and tandoori spices, the 'sauce' it was in was super liquidy and unfortunately, tasteless. None of us were a fan of the chicken dish. The naan was great though! Soft yet a slight crisp and it went well with the prawn and pork dish - dipping the naan and scooping the sauce over the rice was delicious.

Overall, the service was really great, the décor was unique but the food was OK - I would recommend the kati rolls, if anything. I was disappointed in the portion sizes and the flavors - I would have much preferred heading to a classic Indian restaurant without all the hype to get the real experience of flavor and bang for my buck. Though, I can understand why people would line up for this place, they have a great patio which makes for a great summer hangout, it's a hot new restaurant and it's on 17th avenue. But for me, it wasn't all that it was made out to be :\ Likely will not return for the food."}
{"text":"This is now my most favourite Indian restaurant!

The atmosphere was super modern and trendy. It had a upscale, yet quaint vibe. Other than the Indian music playing you would have NEVER guessed you were in an Indian restaurant.

We sat on the patio, which was covered. It looks like the covers go back similar to an RV. We were expecting a big rainstorm so the coverage was wicked while still getting to experience being outdoors.

Our server, Claudia, was INCREDIBLE! She was there exactly when you needed a drink or were ready to order the next item. She only managed to catch me once with my mouth full, when asking how everything tastes lol. Her suggestions for items were super on point, timely and sooo sooo delicious.

They have unique drinks! I tried two mango gin drinks that were incredible. One was a bit spicier which I loved and the other was a bit sweeter and frothy, also delicious. 

I would HIGHLY recommend this place As a must do for Indian food on the trendy 17th ave! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I gave Calcutta 4 stars for the great service, cocktails, and the decor.  

Love the food; however, the food portions could have been a smidgen bigger. 

The patio had a long wait, so I hope I can get on next time! Definitely a neat spot whether you're dining for two or in a group!"}
{"text":"When ever I try recommended restaurant by friends, normally ends not that great. But then this time around too start was not that great. I would request Calcutta cricket club to give tables if they are empty rather than making people wait. So start was wait for 40 mins. But then we requested to give us food fast as we had flight to catch. Service after request was pretty quick and that made my day. We tried puchkas which were heaven as I like them chilled and spicy. Even paneer kathi rolls were different and great. Doi Baigan in curry is the best did not expect them to cook in sarsaw oil and was delicious. Naam and paratha were cooked to perfection. All and all must try if you visit Calgary and for die hard cricket fan !"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and atmosphere! Their food is delicious (especially the chicken and lamb Kati rolls)! For a party of two, we ended up having 2 Kati rolls, chicken tikka and beef Curry (which even seemed to be too much. Maybe didn't need the chicken tikka!) beware though, their default \"garlic naan\" seems plain to me, barely tasted any garlic or even seen any!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and ambiance, but food was ok. We had the kati roll & broccoli as appetizers, which are good. For our entrees we had the parsi shrimp and the fried pomfret. Shrimp entree was really small. Pomfret was nice but needed more spices. Overall an ok experience not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Each and every time I come here I find something new to fall in love with. The food is always amazing, and the staff are very friendly.  The fresh vibe they bring to their modern take one Indian cuisine is a welcome change. 

The amazing cocktails and high energy atmosphere really make this a place to return to time and again."}
