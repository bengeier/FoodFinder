{"text":"If \"meh\" could be a description I would use it. This restaurant left us indifferent. We went while it was relatively slow, four tables were full. Our waitress was slow to take orders and a bit spacey. Our food came out of the kitchen missing main components and we had to correct them. The meat however did taste good and the beer selection is decent. Overpriced for the quality of grub. I probably wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Just finished eating there and could not write this quick enough. Each time I've gone there the service has gotten progressively worse. Was looking for southern BBQ. Nothing like Texas. Wouldn't recommend this place at all. Food is not bad, service is bad and prices way too high."}
{"text":"Horrible location- homeless shelter, dead-end parking and no taxi access. Once inside you regret how nice you have dressed. I was told they had done a face lift and it was more modern. Obviously nobody informed their beer swilling pub fans that they were trying to class up the joint. During a recent intimate dinner for 2 for a birthday we were seated on high stools in the pub- absolutely awful. Yes I asked to move but no. Then as per the way of Murphy's Law they seated a table of 12 beside us with an obnoxious child- please people consider a babysitter! Not only is it an inappropriate place t have a child (did I mention its a pub) but no one is able to have a decent conversation when your child is such a brat. The ONLY good thing is the unlimited crab for $38 per person, and the awesome $6 mojitos. I know this business is considering bankruptcy but I urge them to reconsider their location, and their decor ambition before pulling the plug- Good Luck."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but if I hear of a restaurant that has both seafood and BBQ under the same roof, then say no more - I'm there!  And there, again and again. That place in Calgary is Booker's BBQ Grill & Crab Shack. \"Shack\" doesn't do justice to this sprawling, rustic warehouse-type restaurant. It's a really cool, unpretentious exposed brick space on the east end of downtown. Inside, it's just dark enough to camouflage the inevitable sauce drips you're likely to get if you're there for Monday's All-You-Can-Eat baby back ribs or the butter drips you're liable to get on Sunday's All-You-Can-Eat snow crab night. I've partaken of the Sunday crab night multiple times and all I can say is if you've ever wondered what it's like to eat like Friar Tuck, they'll satisfy your curiosity once and for all. Also, if you've never had a deep fried pickle, you don't know what you're missing. The good thing is, Bookers will happily fill you in, and up, with all the Cajun goodness that you've been missing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bookers for a casual dinner. We wouldn't go back despite the great service. When the hostess brought us to the booth there was obviously water dripping down from the pipes above and moved us to another booth. Crab cake api was delicious but the crab meal was horrible - over priced for snow crab and over cooked (soft shells, watery). My wife sent hers back I continued with mine. Her 2nd attempt was much better. Next time we will buy our own crab and have a better meal."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now for their Sunday and Monday crab and rib special. Staff friendly and restaurant had a good atmosphere. With all the TV's around would be good on game night. If you're staying at the Delta it is definitly something to remember during the cold/wet days."}
{"text":"This place looks like an old loading dock when you first see it, but it's quite different inside. It's large and has a Louisiana, Cajun theme to it. Currently they are closed for about a month for renos. This place is great if you like blues music, they have a band that plays each week, and enjoy smoked meat and fish dishes. I have tried numerous things, and have to say that everything is good. Try the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Jumbalaya, both delicious. They have an extensive bar menu, and the staff are really great as well, better than most restaurants. The only down side is I find it really dark - but this could also be an upside for some, especially after alot of drinking. This place looks like it could get rowdy (in a good way). This place is definately  a Stampede party favorite."}
{"text":"We had a reservation so we got in fairly quickly.  We had brisket, ribs and pulled pork, all of which were so... so.  I found the meat all too dry.  The saiad and veggies were good.  The stuffed potato was good...a bit pricey at over 16 dollars.  All in all, I have no idea why people eat here in the noise and turmoil.  The service was mediocre at best.  First and last time, sadly."}
{"text":"Very neat place. I just popped in with my Bf for lunch after a nice walk downtown.  I had the mac and cheese. My only Complaint would be how salty the food is here. My Cesar was very good. I don't know if I would come back again. Maybe for some live music."}
{"text":"Calgary has been getting a bad rep in the US media because of the XXLL Keystone pipeline; I suggest instead of transporting Oil Sand in those pipes, they transport crab legs from Bookers. We took my brother to Bookers for his birthday. The location is made for Yelpers; in downtown Calgary right across the street from a homeless shelter in a nondescript building. SHAZAM.. you can accumulate street cred for braving the rough streets to get good food. The door transports visitors to a different realm : plush seats, Flat-screen TV wallpaper, clientele wearing their Easter clothes. We did not reserve and had to wait at the bar for a minute, but it was worth it. After we snagged a table, there was no stopping the buckets of crab legs and ribs . I am talking juicy, succulent, ginormous crab legs, tender well-seasoned ribs. I did not know this day would come, Food 1-Jay 0. throw in polite hipster waitstaff and its definitely worth the $39,99 All-you-can eat."}
{"text":"This was my first attempt at finding quality American barbeque in Calgary.  I ordered a mix of the lean and fatty brisket and pulled pork.  The meats we're pretty good but the star was the  jalapeno Mac 'n cheese.  The three choices of sauces tasted ok but not great.  The Kansas City sauce is definitely not in the same style as any authentic KC sauce you'll find at Gate's, Jack Stack's, Joe's, or Arthur Bryant's."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service, and tonnes of TVs. Bring your appetite as portions are huge. Had the fried chicken sandwich that was positively heart attackable but so tasty. Also loved the tunes."}
{"text":"Went to bookers for a birthday dinner. The waitress spilled wine over my sister and her husband..covering my sisters white blouse and stained the front of my brother In- laws sweater that was ironically his birthday gift. My sister and brother in-law did not freak out, they were very understanding about it. The waitress offers to have them go get their clothes dry cleaned and submit the bill to them. There was not even one complimentary drink taken off the Bill for the inconvenience of sitting in soaking wet clothes .. Which they also had to wear out after dinner. Just a disappointing experience, accidents happen and that is understandable... It is the method in which they are handled shows the quality of service."}
{"text":"Really great experience in many ways, AYCE ribs and crab was absolutely delicious, with fantastic house-made sauces for the ribs. Ate a few buckets of crab and a few full racks of ribs, definitely had my moneys worth. Bookers has a great environment as well, my friends and I sat at the bar and were helped by Matt \"The Honey Badger\" Tanner, really fantastic guy who helped to make the experience really special."}
{"text":"Booker's all you can eat crab on Sunday has been a family favorite for special occasions for years. Unfortunately, tonight we learned that in recent months they no longer serve the legs. It is all you can eat claws. The place is packed, so clearly people still love it, but we were used to the higher quality version of their meal.  We talked to the staff and were told it was a supply issue. That's fine, but I would have liked to know of this change upon ordering. Bottom line: if you have had great crab at Booker's in the past, be warned it may not be what you expect anymore."}
{"text":"Took my father and brother here last Sunday. It's was awesome! Service was great the endless crab was delicious which my dad and myself had and my brother ate the ribs! He said the ribs were good but having sauce with it would have made it even better!"}
{"text":"Love this place. But for chicken wings, don't expect too much - and I'm not knocking them for it, as you *know* you're heading into a bbq and crab shack - but the bbq part of it does imply that some wings are at least on the menu.  The wings were decent size, but a bit dry and given that they were 'screaming hot' I was a touch let down."}
{"text":"Definitely a breath of fresh air in this city.  So many restaurants and so many rich people who love to go out and only Bookers has the balls to do a totally unique menu with some pretty legit cajun classics.  Its easy to butcher this style of food with low quality ingredients and a ton of spice but every time I've been to Bookers they have definitely done it right.....granted its not as good as the real thing from New Orleans....but our seafood isn't as fresh out here so its as good as it gets.  This place has been a regular in my repertoire ever since I was a little kid......even then I was taught to expect a large swarm of bums out front...but hey no place is perfect...hahha.  Give it a try....I've heard that this is Iginla's favorite restaurant and I've personally seen him there twice."}
{"text":"I think the first time that I went to Bookers was maybe 10 years ago... I thought it was GREAT! Sure, in a bit of an edgy neighbourhood downtown but the concept of a 'true' Southern BBQ house really worked for them... think ribs, brisket, chicken and lots of that Bubba Gump shrimp... you know, I'd never even seen a crawdad before I had some there... grits, corn bread... down home true Southern cooking in a big industrial space with picnic tables, red checked table cloths and metal plates and, of course, crab races on Fridays.   ...then one day I had the urge for some smokey cooking and key lime pie and EVERYTHING had changed. The new owners got rid of all the kitchy down homie ness and (the horror!) replaced all that unique Southern BBQ food with things like Fettucini Alfredo and Marinara Pizza... there was nare a crab nor crawdad to be found.   So with that background I was a bit unexcited to hear that I was meant to go to Bookers for dinner the other night. What I found was new inspiration! Little did I know but the folks who brought us Wild Wood Pub and Dining Room (now sadly gone because of a ghastly clerical error and a 'rhymes with sick' Landlord) are now behind this much slicker and sophisticated Bookers... Sure to become a professional go to spot (think Investment Bankers, Lawyers and Accountants wanting to escape beer in the core.. a bit Soho-esqe) and a favourite for those who are going to be living in the new residential spots immediately there.   What I'm especially excited about is that their menu seems to be embracing a lot of what made the old School Bookers work but in a really updated fashion. The smoked BBQ ribs I had were pretty easily some of the best ribs I've ever had in my life (including my own ribs... note to self: need to punch up my ribs a few notches if I'm going to compete).   All together, I think this place is sure to be a long term winner, especially as the new Bow River pathway system and river walk starts to bring the forces of light back into the area East of City Hall."}
{"text":"My favorite place for wings in Calgary. I prefer to arrive before the Happy Hour crowd starts to roll in. The staff are usually very helpful and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Starting the eve at one star. Bottle, not full pint can of Stongbow is $7.  Even in Calgary that is egregious money grab. Let's hope it gets better.  Very basic. Ribs were over done. Which I thought was their specialty. Service was good.   Don't go out of your way to go here."}
{"text":"Excellent crab  Corn bread  And martinis  Live blues music at 2100  Awesome dinner  My first time here, I will be back"}
{"text":"Last night we went to Booker's for all you can eat crab. As a side dish, I had the coleslaw - which was devoid of flavor and somewhat warm. My wife tried the baked beans, which were delicious. The crab was not cooked consistently, sometimes it was done well, and sometimes it was overcooked. Our server was difficult to pin down when she was needed, and would often be gone for 15 minutes when asked to get us more crab. When we asked her for our bill, she was gone for about 15 minutes until she came back and asked us if we wanted our bill again. We had not been to Booker's for a couple of years until last night, and we really did not enjoy our experience this time. For the quality of food and service we received, the $115 we spent before tip was too pricey."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Booker's, but I was left really disappointed which really sucks. First off, finding parking nearby is damn near impossible!   Having not fully prepared for AYCE (like most of those at our table, we had about 12 with us that night) a GF and I split the Snow Crab Dinner and for our two sides we went with the cajun rice and gumbo. Booker's boasts to be \"known for their southern cooking\" so I was expecting quality southern inspired food (seriously, we're in Alberta not Texas or Tennessee where I've had some authentic southern cooking)  To start, we ordered the calamari. Which I must admit was quite tasty. The batter was more tempura like and extra crispy.  That's pretty much the highlight of our dinner. Both the gumbo and cajun rice were super bland! I ended up pouring the melted butter for the crab into the rice and adding copious amount of S&P to the gumbo to make it somewhat decent. Our crab although sweet, looked like it suffered from muscular dystrophy. How they manage to pump out these huge crab legs to the demand of all the people there for AYCE is beyond me. You're not getting quality, meaty crabs though so maybe that's how?  Everyone who did do AYCE only got 3 rounds in. Not because they were full, but because it was so busy and it too so long to get another order in and they decided to call it quits.  Booker's claim to be \"a hidden gem\" of Calgary. Yes, if that gem was a cubic zirconia - all show and no value."}
{"text":"I love Bookers, I always get the brisket and share the appy of crab legs! The staff are always amazing and get to know their regulars. I went to their Mardi Gras celebration this year and also had a blast! Sometimes the servers can be a little bit slow. But the food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"It's out of the way, but it's worth it!  Peppered Vodka Caesar, Jambalaya, crab!  Makes me hungry!"}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I hadn't heard of Booker's before a friend messaged me to come check out his blues band at the crab shack.   We came here on a Friday around 830, and the restaurant was less than half full.   We had a couple of pints and also indulged in some eats. I had a pulled pork sandwich with a garden salad, my friend had the blackened cat fish. The catfish was the cats ass - really moist and a lot of spice. My pulled pork sandwich was nice too, a generous portion of juicy pulled pork with some slaw on a kaiser bun, topped with a deep fried dill pickle. The food wasn't anything I was raving about but it was good.  What we came here for was the music, and as a music venue, this place is aces. It has a similar feel to the iron wood, but a better layout and more space. There was a good dance space, and I took advantage of that! I actually wish this was a more happening place and that more people came out here, I would like to spend more time here hanging with friends and listening to bands. Really great for that.   Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Please read through my review, seen in screenshots on my profile. Yelp did not provide me a user friendly way to attach my photos to my review.    In short:  We booked this event a week in advance- asked all the questions to ensure we were choosing the right venue, and that the venue was prepared for our event. We arrived, got lost in a mess of one waitress and +20 guests, weren't served in a timely manner (we were there from 7:30-after midnight), were then expected to pay $95 per person (for no reason other than the staff did not know how to split individual bills), upset a waitress (who sobbed in front of us), waited upon a \"manager\" (who could only apologize as a solution), provided the restaurant with our own solution (everybody pay $50.00 with no gratuity), and left with an incredibly negative taste."}
{"text":"this place is a lot nicer on the inside than you would expect from it's exterior  ult. crab / ribs 5/5"}
{"text":"I had wanted to eat here since I saw it on You Gotta Eat Here. My husband went on Mother's Day Sunday. We ordered the all you can eat ribs and crab legs. Some of the reviews think the price is too expensive, I disagree. I also didn't find it any darker than many other restaurants. Judging by some reviews on here I expected to require a flashlight to see.  It is a lot of food, which is why I think the price is worth it. I will agree with the majority that the service was so-so. I wish our waitress had told us that the sides were unlimited too - we figured that out from the table next to us. The cornbread was amazing and had jalapeños in it. The ribs were gigantic.  The baked beans were quite good too. The mashed potatoes were nothing special and I wouldn't order them again. I noticed multiple families with small children there which did surprise me as it seemed like more of an adult joint. The only thing I really didn't like was how we were called a couple of hours prior to our reservation and informed that our reservation was only good for two hours. When we arrived and throughout our stay it wasn't even that busy. I also didn't love sitting at a bar stool beside my partner instead of across but hey - not a big deal. 2 hours is not long when crab legs take a while to crack and you're chatting away. I don't enjoy feeling rushed. Editing to add one major thing I forgot: I really wish places would charge a dollar or two more and use REAL BUTTER! It makes the world of a difference with seafood."}
{"text":"The food was just mediocre, but the portion of the food was huge! Service was none but if you went with a group then the wait staff love you. Overall, I dont have many comments about this restaurant and I wouldn't revisit as this sports bar wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I had a group here for lunch. An extra person came at the last minute & they were able to move us to a bigger table with no issues. Unfortunately, we ordered after a large group & our food was very slow coming out. When it arrived, I think they had rushed the food out. My steak sandwich was raw (I ordered medium rare but it was barely seared & dark red) and had a huge fat/gristle running through the middle of it. I didn't send it back as I was hosting the lunch and my customers had to get back to work. I won't be rushing back here."}
{"text":"I went to Bookers probably 8 years ago and remember loving it. So we decided to go back (we live in Edmonton) this year for some crab.   Definitely not thrilling... I've had better crab at red lobster and obviously cheaper there too.   For about $120, we each had a drink and the crab dinner. The crab was okay... quite cold and the last few legs I had were so overcooked that I couldn't eat them. Sides were average.   Definitely not as good as I remember and I wouldn't go back. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I've lived in Calgary almost all of my life, and I can't believe I've never heard of this place.  My co-worker suggested our office venture to \"the Shack\" and bond over all we can handle crab. I thought this was a solid idea.  When I go to these \"all you can eat\" events, I expect high volume, mediocre quality. This is fair since their trying to keep up with serving our gluttony. To my pleasant, and maybe regretful, surprise the crab was consistently served hot and fresh. The servers were on top of keeping our buckets replenished. I recommend taking up Wendy P's suggestion below, and have a Beam Lemonade to wash down your crab.  I left with my pocket considerably empty and a goal of avoiding crab for a year. I would say Booker's did their job, and did it well.  Come one, come all to feast on crab like you've never done before."}
{"text":"I travel to Calgary ever couple months and eat very well when I do.  I do believe eating at Bookers tonight was one of the best meals I have eaten here.  Try everything as I had three dishes and was blown away by every one.  The maple bacon donuts were to die for, but likely crazy high calories count.  Drinks good too!"}
{"text":"Really amazing ribs, but the crab legs were just alright. They get cold before you're onto the fifth one. First world problems I guess..."}
{"text":"Damn good food.   Surprising to see southern food done right in Canada but this place nailed it. Its got a great atmosphere, good staff, and its priced pretty well.   Although I wasn't there for a live music night, it seems like a good venue for that sort of thing so try to go when they're going to have a band in house.   I was there for a Stanley Cup Finals game and it was a great place to watch the game. I'd recommend this place for groups."}
{"text":"Some of the best crab I have ever had. I also had smoked chicken wings which were also mouth watering. They give you your sauce on the side so you can have the option of enjoying the smoke flavour seperate.  The place looks like a dive bar trying to look like a sea shack. Our table was wobbly but fixed with coasters from our lovely waitress. I biggest complaint would be that it's a little tricky to get to the parking lot if you don't know where your going and GPS is no help. The food though makes those gripes all worth it though. So good, mouth watering yummy yums!"}
{"text":"From the outside, Bookers looks like a really sketchy, was-once-a-bar-but-is-now-closed shack that you would not want to enter unless you knew your friends were already in there, and there was a reservation. Anyway, so we did have a reservation yesterday, and we had the private room booked, since we were a large group. Upon entering, we were surprised at the cool industrial-yet-chic vibe of the place. I liked it immediately. I kind of wished we stayed in the main area, but we were whisked upstairs to the private room.  When we looked at the menu, everything looked appetizing! We ordered 2 buckets of crab legs and a bucket of deep fried pickles as appetizers while we perused the menu. I had an especially hard time trying to decide between my Snow Crab Dinner, Beer-battered fish sandwich, Crab sandwich, and fish and chips for my main meal. I finally settled on the beer-battered sandwich. With yam fries on the side. And a half salad on the side too. When my sandwich came, I dove right in - and it was GOOD! I was very pleased. My yam fries were really tasty too, and my 'half' salad was pretty huge. I had to ask the waitress again if she had messed up my order, but she said \"Nope, that's half\". I took a few bites of my fries and salad, but honestly, my sandwich was so good I could barely stop eating it.   My group had mixed feelings about their sandwiches and the pickles (too salty, some said), but I loved my meal. Service was a bit slow, but I guess that was because of the size of our group. But overall, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Booker's for a birthday party and some live band action and I really enjoyed myself!    Hubby and I split the yam fries and sauce because we'd already ate being that we have 5 kids and the party didn't start until 8pm.  So we decided on splitting a side.  The yam fries were so good.  Last night I made some variation of them, but not as good as Booker's!  I had friends get the crab bucket and they really enjoyed it.    The live band we saw was Hurricane Felix and the Souther Twisters.  So good!  If you love rockabilly they are one band to watch for!  It wasn't long before they had the smallish dance floor filled.  I was in my element and lovin' it!    The decor was nicer than I expected for a 'crab shack.'  I remember dark greys and wood.    I would definitely go back and if they have more bands in like they did that night... I'll be back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like crab?  I have been wanting to go here for sometime now. Its seemed like one of those places that was just far away from my work and home (and because it's in downtown you know parking is going to be a nightmare) that I had not been yet.  I was pleasantly surprised, I read a few reviews and people had mixed things to say, I talked to a few people at work and I got the same response but I really enjoyed my visit to Bookers. There was a decent selection of beer but they are defiantly not a 'craft' beer place like others in the area but they had enough to wet your whistle. Some people in my party ordered Cesars that were good and included the standard Cesar garnishes  with a little piece of bacon in them (who doesn't like bacon). One guy said, 'that went down too good'! I was driving so it was straight to the carbonated soda beverage for me. We started off with a crab bucket which was a decent appetizer especially since my spouse and me were not going to be ordering crab in the remainder of our meal. The bucket was $20 bucks and you got a whole snow crab worth of legs which was decent. The crab tasted fresh, which is always the more important part of shellfish eating in Alberta. The butter that accompanied the dish was delicious but lets be honest, it's butter.... have you ever been like this butter is gross, no.... butter is awesome, no matter how you slice it! My husband had the one piece fish and chip which he said was pretty standard, no amazing, ground breaking stuff here but he said he would order it again. I ordered the Jambalaya, which was HUGE! It was full of sausage, shredded chicken and shrimp, it had a bit of heat but not too much that made it uncomfortable to eat. Friends of ours ordered the all you can eat ribs and crab, which is you can eat that much maybe worth the $45 price tag per person. They had multiple rounds and seems to be thoroughly enjoying themselves.   The restaurant was pretty busy considering that it was a) fathers day and b) the NBA finals, but we still got great service. This place is a great place to just roll up your sleeves and get a little messy breaking into some crab.  Will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fun drink menu to start things off on a good note.  From there I usually spend 15 minutes on the menu trying to decide between four items that I want - and it does not help when the other servers bring food by and suddenly you change your mind again! Fun venue, tons of tv's and just a good feel about the place.  Servings are huge and well worth the price."}
{"text":"Have really enjoyed bookers a few times, though our last experience was not so great. My boyfriend and I were craving pulled pork sandwiches, and knew bookers would fulfil our craving. We were sat by the door, which was not a very comfortable location, but these things happen. Our sandwiches were tasty but not the best I've had. We waited for about 10-15 minutes for the server to come back and accept our payment after bringing us our bill, at which point we just wanted to leave already! The worst part came later.... My BF and I both got food poisoning from something that we were served that night. Can't be sure what, but I suspect perhaps the coleslaw. I e-mailed the address found online once I was on my feet again, just to let them know, and received nothing in return, which I am still unimpressed with. Even a generic response would have been nice.    We will go back again and give them another try, as it's a good place, but I think I'll stick to the crab legs - won't be able to stomach pulled pork from there for a long time!!   Update: We decided to give Bookers another shot, and went there with a group for a celebration for my boyfriend this past Friday (June 2012). The food was good, and that was about it. The service was horribly slow - it was not busy.   The straw the broke the camel`s back, however, was when the waitress dumped her tray of three full pints of beer on my boyfriend. He was quite literally soaked from head to toe, and she barely offered an apology, let alone a free drink or anything. Accidents happen, of course, but to barely say 'sorry' or offer any sort of reconciliation is just not acceptable. If I had been that waitress, I would have bought the table a round of drinks out of my own pocket - but I guess that's just me. My boyfriend did not make a big deal out of it, since we all understand that these things happen, but many of the others in our group were annoyed and shocked that he remained so calm after not receiving an apology - just a couple of napkins. Our bill was a few hundred dollars, so it would have been worth her while to provide better service (ironically, our bill would have been higher had the service been better and we had been able to order more!).   Sadly, we will not be going back to Bookers again; between food poisoning, no response AT ALL from an inquiry, slow service on more than one occasion, and no apology after a whole tray of drinks jumped - I just can't bring myself to give these folks any more business."}
{"text":"I was a bit wary based on some recent reviews, but went with an open mind. We had amazing service and the food was so good! I'll certainly be back again...the  only hard part about visiting here is making a decision on what to try next. Thanks to Meghan for taking great care of us!! Best service in town!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Bookers on Oct. 24, 2010, and I wanted to let you know how my experience was.  It was a birthday party for a friend. There were ten to twenty of us throughout the night.  We are predominantly restaurant and bar staff, therefore we know how to behave.   Firstly, the food was fantastic, and came out quickly.  Our server seemed very nervous when we were only a table of ten, and increasingly nervous as more people showed up. I assume large crowds are a big part of bookers, but I felt like we were overwhelming her.   However, she was attentive and friendly the whole night, just a little nervous.   At one point, when there were four servers/hostesses helping deliver drinks, two of them ran directly into one another, and broke a beer bottle. No big deal, it's a restaurant, beer bottles sometimes get broken. Some was spilt onto a woman's jacket at another table.   At this point, a manager on duty came over to pretty much 'scold us'.  He said there had already been one MAJOR ACCIDENT, and that there are REGULAR PEOPLE trying to have a nice dinner.  He spent the next fifteen minutes talking with the table whose jacket was spilt on, pointing towards our table, and apologizing.  A server spilt a drink, and we are made to feel responsible?  He apologized profusely to them, and didn't so much as come over to our table for the rest of the night. Instead, stood by the hostess stand pointing towards our table, and complaining. There was no doubt about it, he was not happy we were there.   I was embarassed. We were all embarassed.   It is such a nice restaurant, newly renovated, with great food. It's a shame that we were left with the distinct impression that we were somehow a nusiance, rather than a welcomed guest.  I was pretty surprised by the whole experience, and wrote this e-mail to the general manager, word for word, and got no response.  All I wanted was some acknowledgement for the manager's rudeness. Who knows, maybe my letter went to the exact guy I was complaining about."}
{"text":"Wow, what a place for good BBQ. Smokes Ribs,brisket, chicken, and more. I have become a regular here since moving from Nashville TN. They do it right."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in town. I went there for a wing night $5 for a pound. One star deducted for a slow service. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I waited far too long to try this place. The atmosphere is fun and brings you back to the south! The ribs in the appetizer platter were awesome...I can't wait to try more bbq next time. The deep fried pickles had cornmeal batter, which I normally don't like but it was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"06/18/2014 approximately 6:30pm. TUESDAY WINGS AT BOOKERS!!!!  lb of wings for $4.99 THEY SMOKE THE WINGS!!!!  They had me at this selling point.  So a group of 10 at a table...now before I go on further, this turned out to be one of the worst wing nights we've ever had.  It even came to the point we were outside talking about how we will do our next chicken fry for July or August.  So for the few of us drinks came, for others they were waiting for quite a bit...meaning 20-25 minutes.  So not really starting off with a good experience.  So finally our drinks came and we look over the menu,  Everyone was coming to an agreement they were ready to order.  Unfortunately we were not attended to for 20 minutes.  This caused for one of us to approach the bar to have the bartender send over the waitress.  That took another 20 minutes til we got our order taken.  So we gave our orders to the waitress.  Keep in mind its 16 orders of wings.  There were 2 entree orders, 5 side orders of jalapeno mac and cheese, and an order of fries.  Not to bad of an order for the night and drinks.  So by now its coming to an hour and 15 minutes, we are antsy for our food.  Our waitress came out to tell us our food is coming and explained that instead of individual plates for the wings, it would be grouped.  This meaning wings would be on a platter.  She also indicated the wings are not tossed in sauce, individual sauce cups will be given.  So we nod and smile and finally the food starts coming out, they give 3 platters of wings and a platter of various sauces in a cup.  For the people who ordered salt and pepper wings, the shakers are in the middle of the table.  Salt and pepper the wings themselves....FAIL!!!!!  The girl who dropped off the sauces to us didn't even take the time to tell us which sauce was which:  Buffalo, Carolina, Kansas City, or Maple Bourbon....FAIL!!!!  Don't get me wrong I think we were able to figure the sauces out from sampling.  So as we are eating, we notice that the wings were gone pretty fast.  Now out of the 10 of us, 6 of us order 2 lbs of wings.  Now don't think we were being petty but the amount of wings we ate in total came up to approx 75 wings.  I asked the waitress how many wings usually come with a pound.  she advised 8-10 wings.  so in my calculation that would be based on 8 wings each 128 pieces.  So if  \"WE ARE COUNTING WINGS\" per the manager we are still short 51 wings.  As the waitress was about to clear our table, I asked her about the wings and that we may short wings as customer.  She asked if we wanted more, but we decided that what ever was brought out to us they can charge, what was not brought, just take it off the bill.  15 minutes later this guy with his ball cap backwards approaches us.  He indicated he was the manager, cool, brought to his attention we might short of wings in our order.  He gave us the same option for them to bring out the remaining wings or what we would like.  We just asked if they could remove the wings that were not brought out.  He then turned and may have muttered the f-bomb.  I wasn't the only one who heard, but also another person.  So we are sitting at our table, the table hasn't been cleared.  We are waiting for our bill.  The waitress comes and asks how many orders need to come off the bill.  We didn't know what to say as how do you measure a pound out by wings that are already eaten.  So we went off by their estimates of wings per order ratio.  8-10.  Unfortunately an agreement could not be made of how many orders to be taken off.  So essentially it was agree 8 orders of wings to be charged.  So the waitress was gonna seperate the bill.  The bill came back with us being charged 9 orders.  We asked if it was 8 and she said she would make the correction.  Another 20 minutes roll and the manager comes back and asks if we have finished counting wings....seriously ok, yah I can take a joke.  But I can't speak for the other people and it came down to 2 guys at our table vs the manager, I was stuck in between.  So the manager was saying we wanted him to take off another order of wings.  He even said he already taken off half the bill???  Umm lets see 5 bucks times 8 orders....$40...Thats not half the orders we made.  Pretty much he indicated to us he will get the bill corrected and have us leave their establishment....Really?    Ok, so yah we were not feeling it so we got the bill which the waitress seperated for us.  There were issues with certain orders mixed with other peoples bills...lets just pay and get the hell out.  So after reading this I hope you didn't spend 2 hours and 30 minutes reading this because that was how long it was for our experience with Bookers.    You know whats even funny, before we even went, talked about the all you can eat crab special,  sundays $42.95, not no more.  3 of us that were planning on going.  Thats approx 126.00 for food, plus drinks and tip not being spent there.  God bless and happy eating....somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed half stars. I don't know of many AYCE crab legs places in Calgary so if that's what you're into, this is not a bad place to get it. $45pp is a bit steep (compared to Toronto places) but I like the service and it comes out in small portions at a time so you're not wasteful. Waitresses are mindful of when you're ready for the next serving so they'll bring it out as you're done the last. I didn't think the ribs were that great. There were good rib sauces (3 to choose from) but it was a bit too burnt and not very juicy/tender. I would stick to getting my money's worth on the crabs."}
{"text":"We were in town so we tried it out. Place was empty when we got there. The waitress was awesome (that's what the one star is for) As for the food. We got a big platter to share with macaroni. The macaroni was tasteless. All the meats we got were okay, nothing special. Very disappointed especially since this place was featured on a tv show. Honestly the sides were the best part of the meal! I would would not come back here."}
{"text":"Appetizer St. Louis Ribs...5 stars!  Every rib was tender, even the lean ones!  The ribs are lightly coated with a BBQ sauce that is almost like a glaze...perfectly balanced and doesn't overwhelm the meat (most places use too much BBQ sauce).  Simply amazing!  Calamari...4 stars. Very good but needed a few more seconds in the fryer...some were perfect but others were a bit stringy when I bit into them.  Also, the crust was quite limp and fell apart too easily.  Smokehouse brisket...5 stars!  I must've had slices from a fresh slab of brisket cause the meat was SO tender, almost short rib-like.  Definitely the best brisket I've ever had.    Baked Mac & Cheese...5 stars.  Very light mac and cheese like Monki's and Vintage's.  If you prefer a heavier m&c like The Keg's then you won't enjoy Booker's.  The cheese is light and creamy and doesn't overwhelm the meats you choose as an add-on.    To be continued..."}
{"text":"Not the nicest area of town but a short walk from the nearby Delta hotel and I'm a huge BBQ fan, so was excited to see the sign while driving in.  It was Monday night so football was on the many large screen TVs which was perfect for me... BBQ AND football. Heaven...  I sat at the bar since I was on my own and ordered up a BBQ staple - pulled pork sandwich, served with slaw on the bun and a side of sweet potatoe fries. Not a big slaw fan eater but I left it as is and it didn't detract from the juicy well balanced sauce and soft white bun. Happy to see they didn't screw it up by serving it as some ill-advised nouveau cuisine panini as I've seen at times. The fries were outstanding and served up with maple syrup. A nice touch and very tasty. Not a health meal, but I knew that going in - this was an escape from responsible eating...  This place attempts to replicate your typical southern BBQ joint, complete with that wooden, slightly run down garage feel. Everything is comfortable, clean and service is friendly, so no need to worry.  Price with an O'Doul's near-beer and tip was 19$."}
{"text":"I honestly had a great experience here. The staff was friendly and the food was amazing. Of course, I went in during off hours, arrived around 3pm and the place was a ghost town. So service was naturally fast and food arrived just as fast. I can't say how busy it gets or if it slows down as far Service, all I can do is speak on my own experience and it was great. The food I ordered was amazing, the brisket burnt ends were out of this world. No idea how to even describe them. The smoked wings were pretty good, the spicy flavor was like franks red hot which isn't bad, the garlic honey were pretty decent too, just not a big kick of flavor like you would expect from wings. The smoked pork ribs were fall off the bone good. These things are cooked to perfection. I recommend this place for some good barbecue, but again, I went in at 3pm when it was a bit slower, so truthfully, I don't know what the traffic is like here."}
{"text":"Bomb. Love the crab and the BBQ options. Can get expensive cause I like too many things on the menu. Great spot for a big group/family dinner. Great to have a good spot like this in Calgary"}
{"text":"We expected to enter some dive-shack that had Louisiana decor, overenthusiastic waiters and patrons with crab/lobster bibs. Instead we walked into a swank bar area that one would find in Stephen Ave. It was the Cactus club with Big T's menu.  Our group of no good music snobs immediately hated the pianists, who belted out pop songs to wow a slim crowd. But I have to admit, they had me when they did a cheesy rendition of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air intro. Still the music was just too loud that our table struggled in our conversations. I resigned myself to watching some lame pool tournament on TV.  No complaints about the service, our waitress was attentive. I had Jalepeno poppers, which were \"meh\" and the fish burger. The fish was a little on the bland side, but I liked how it was lightly fried and enjoyed the light texture. Whatever else was in the sandwich wasn't memorable for me.  I never knew this place existed. Very odd location to be at and not a very convenient location to reach. Just not worth the visit. But I thank Booker for rekindling my love of Will Smith.  \"HEY YO UNCLE PHIL!!\""}
{"text":"Well the food is satisfactory but the service was below standard. In particular our server was inattentive and dismissive. It was not busy but it seemed like all staff wanted to be somewhere other than there. We have been here a few times before but based on the quality of service we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I heard rumour that the All You Can Eat Crab is no more... I know I'm going on a bit of hearsay with this one  (*Edit* -Turns out I was wrong! AYCE Crab and Ribs is still around, but only on Sunday._ But with it - I'm sure this could be a 5-star. It's got all the qualities of a hidden gem. It's a dive that's authentic on the outside but superb on the inside. It's that damn sexy grime with a touch of class. Should I come as I am, or is this a fancy place in disguise? Bookers is just plain cool.  Now for what I'm worried to change by sharing... Bookers has a patio that's outside along the river front, they serve tasty food, especially the brisket ends, those things have been taking over my dreams, they serve local Wild Rose beer... And the best part - the patio never seems full, even on the most patio-est of patio days. It's the perfect hang out to be in the middle of it all and still get away from it all.  We had a bucket of crab too, which was great, but for a land locked province, I'd have to say that I love the novelty of seafood, but wind up enjoying myself when I go for the BBQ."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed the food here, and so we decided it would be awesome to have Booker's cater our at-Home wedding. We are so thrilled that we did. The food was a HUGE hit - especially the jalapeño Mac and cheese (they even left out the onions for me!) Our guests really enjoyed the food! We are especially grateful to Falyn and the catering staff at Booker's who went out of their way to get the food to us. It made our day even that more amazing. THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Had fish and chips... Two small heavily battered peices of fish, 10 pounds of fries, tasteless tarter sauce,  and bland coleslaw."}
{"text":"Booker's, where have you been all my life? I don't know why it took so long for me to find out about this place, but I sure am glad I did.  The outside of this place made me think I was about to walk into a dive, and I was OK with that, as long as the food was good. Well, it certainly isn't a dive when you get past the front door, and the food is, in fact, great.  They do barbecue really well. I ordered the Brisket, but they had just run out. Normally I'd be a bit upset, but in this case it proves they do their own barbecue from scratch and that isn't as common as you might think. Further to that, they have so many tempting options I had more of a problem deciding what not to have.  The crab shack and seafood section of the menu is small, I grant you, but I wasn't going to expect miracles here in Calgary. What they do have is top notch (for Calgary). I can't wait to try the all-you-can-eat crab legs on Sunday and Monday nights.  As for the nightlife at Booker's, all I can say so far is that it is big and on Saturday's they have live blues. I'll have to go there on the weekends to see if the nightlife lives up to the rest of the place.  The only area they lack is the beer selection, which surprised me since they have a large bar. It isn't like they have NO quality beer, it's just limited.  If that is the worst thing I can say about this place, I'd say they are doing a pretty damn good job.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service have gone down hill! Very disappointed, definitely in need of some changes and manners."}
{"text":"This is a pit stop for this BBQ lover every time that I go to Calgary.  I have been quite a few times now and have never been disappointed in the quality of the food.  The texture and the smokey taste has always been spot on.    We haven't been able to make a Sunday \"All You Can Eat\" Crab and Ribs but I hear really good things about it.  I have had both the crab and the ribs on a regular night and both were excellent.  Burnt ends will always be my favourite no matter which BBQ joint I am eating at.  It is no exception here.  They have them on the appetizer menu.  I will generally get the Burnt Ends and a \"Bucket 'O Crab\" and that does me in for the night.   They have live entertainment on the weekends which is an added bonus to the ambiance.    Large groups are harder for these folks to handle; hence why the rating isn't a five star.  I brought in a group of 20, the reservation was made weeks ahead of time.  They were out of several items on the menu and it took 2 hours for my guests to get their food.  Our Server was great, but I had angry people at my table!  Bad first impressions last folks!   The food is good enough that I will still be back after that disastrous evening.   Parking is available on the street in front of the restaurant.  If you aren't from Calgary, the first time finding the place with GPS can be tricky.  This restaurant is NOT accessible.  The bathrooms are located upstairs."}
{"text":"Perched on the edge of downtown in between the homeless shelter and the Bow River is Booker's. The decor is funky warehouse and right away you'll feel comfortable in the laid back atmosphere.  We sat at a high table with high chairs near the bar and had a perfect view of everything going on around us. Not knowing what to order, we ordered the 'Garbage Lid' platter of seafood. It was huge, and offered a sampling of shrimp, catfish, crab, coleslaw, potatoes...it was crazy - but good!   ...I'm pretty sure it was a real garbage can lid, too."}
{"text":"We went for the fiance's birthday dinner and opted for all you can eat Crab. Almost our entire table opted for this (there was 8 of us) and it was a lot of fun to have steaming buckets of crab continuously show up as we competed on best practices to get the delicious meat out of those legs. The service was great, our waitress was attentive but not annoying. Parking is kind of lame (stiletto heels in a muddy parking lot is never fun). I really want to go back and check out some blues."}
{"text":"Just a word of caution if you book with Open Table, our reservation was received OK but our request for a low table as opposed to a high top table apparently was not. We had a small child with us and a high top table and tall chairs just doesn't work for young kids. After a few minutes of discussion they finally agreed to let us sit at one of the tables with a bench on one side. Other than that , the service was good, the food also good. Two people had the all you can eat crab and were happy with their meals. Others ate ribs, chicken or brisket which were also good. I was surprised at the number of families there with younger kids as the restaurant does not have a kids' menu but only offered a half order of mac and cheese for the child."}
{"text":"Attended a private party for lunch today. The buffet meal was very good - potato salad, corn bread, corn on the cob,brisket, and jambalaya. The brisket received rave reviews from my table, as did the nicely spiced jambalaya. There was live entertainment that added to a very nice lunch experience. If I lived in the area, I would most definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went Sunday night - during taste of Calgary event - $25 for crab cake appy, ribs and brisket (with potatoes and corn) main, then cheesecake for dessert.  Food was great - lots of bbq smoky flavor.   Service was super slow.  Waitress was helping larger group upstairs and we got neglected.  Sundays and Mondays are all you can eat crab legs ($40) - lots of people were taking advantage of this special while we were there."}
{"text":"I was really excited to pickup some Brisket on the night of the Super Bowl. Unfortunately they don't weigh what they sell. I ordered 1lb (454 gr). It felt light to me so I weighed it on my food scale when I got back to my condo. It weighed 330 gr. 25% or a 1/4 lb less than advertised. Hopefully this post is read and they rectify this. Fortunately the brisket was fantastic!!  It had a thick bark and a 1/4\" fat layer. It was sooo good. I wish I had the extra 1/4 lb to eat!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time I would have given them four and a half stars and then they completely changed the menu and the way they made their food. They used to serve a cool meat platter on a garbage lid and it was huge and yummy. Plus the salt and pepper shrimp was to die for. Now they are trying to look more upscale and for some reason their food is suffering for it. I hope they go back to the recipes or maybe they changed chefs. In any case have a slice of mud pie it is one of the best I've ever had. Plus they still have all you can eat crab. Overall it's worth a look."}
{"text":"Snow crab boil is too expensive and bad taste, no value, I take 35.65 bucks to eat 7oz crab legs and 5 big potatoes and 5 shrimps and 4 corn and 5 small sausage pieces, only 7oz= 4 crab legs?"}
{"text":"Most unorganized, chaotic dining experience ever. Ran out of all you could eat half way through us eating.  Ignored by the server. The manager was nice enough, but better training for staff is needed."}
{"text":"We were recently at Booker's BBQ Grill & Crab Shack for a work function provided by my fiance's employers.  It was a lobster dinner that included over 100 people.  It was a fun, delicious disaster.  But any issues could only be blamed on the organizers and not Booker's.  The Booker's staff really shined under the circumstances, actually, but still had room for improvement.  When we arrived for the event, a little later than we wanted, but still earlier than the starttime, it was already packed tight.  I suspect they oversold tickets and people were spilling out of the event room into other areas that hadn't been reserved for the event.  Once everyone was sorted and seated, the event moved along.  The first issue we ran into with service was not being asked for a drink order.  And being sandwiched against a wall at the end of a long table, it wasn't an option for us to get anyone's attention.  So unfortunately, we went without drinks (which was a shame, because I was really looking forward to a beer).  The food was excellent, and the organization of getting everyone into line was great (buffet style).  Overall, we enjoyed the experience, but largely felt ignored by the serving staff.  Due to the size of the event and the apparent shortage of servers, I will definitely have to go again and judge them on a more equal footing.  An experience I look forward to!"}
{"text":"Entered the restaurant which seemed very deserted. Our party waited about 45min to order the actual food. Next we waited around hour and a half to get the food, and 20min spent according to the waiter, \"platting the food\". In addition, the food is way overpriced.  I've eaten a lot of different kinds of barbecue The brisket sandwich:  -The sandwich had a sauce that was not mentioned on the menu which I did not care for. - had very little meat (1 slice) and around half of it was fat. My friend ordered the brisket plate and it contained 2-3 times more meat then the sandwich. - I agree with other reviews stating the sides were decent.  I must also warn that the Mac and cheese was overly spicy to the point of it no longer being appetizing as well as the corn bread.  Lastly, there there was a bug crawling across the table... Our overall experience was very disappointing and we do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat snow crab legs. I've never come here disappointed with the service! I can't eat so much crab myself, so I get their chicken gumbo and some other dish. Their little dessert jars are to die for!! Try booking in advance on the Open Table app or else show up around 5:00pm on a Sunday to get a table."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of 12 people. Décor of this place is really interesting. It was also interesting how when we called to make the reservation, they pretended that they were very busy. But when we came that was not the case. Food also took a long time to arrive.  I ordered the Crab & Shrimp Boil for $34.95. It was very delicious but I noticed that they forgot something in the entrée. It should also have house-made Andouille sausage and they forgot to put that in. I only noticed it when typing this review because I looked back at the menu picture I took. The Snow crab was very delicious. I should have noticed it when started eating.   In the snow crab entrée there were only 7oz snow crab, potatoes, corn  and 4 pieces of shrimps. Not too filling."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket! Super friendly and accommodating staff. The Ceasar with smoked bacon was outstanding. The smoked wings were delicious. I would avoid the macaroni & cheese and gumbo. The chilli is one of the better sides. I was one of the few people in the restaurant that didn't get the ribs and crab legs Sunday special. They both looked good, but not necessarily my thing. All in all this is a great place to watch sports and eat great smoked meat."}
{"text":"Very pricey. Over $60.00 for dinner, wasn't overly impressed.  Went for the all you can eat crab. I had been here once before a few years ago and the price was much lower (in the 40 dollar range I believe).  The crab is good, however the sides are fairly bland.  Started with the coleslaw which was horrible, dry and no flavour.  The mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and the beans were just okay.  You'll be charged $3.50 for pop which I thought was fair considering they keep refilling them.  However the quality of the sides and the amount of meat you get from the crab legs (which was not a lot) isn't worth $74.00 (after tip) in my opinion.  This was probably my last time coming here, it makes much more sense to me to hit up the Keg and pay $45.00 for massive pieces of crab and hot, flavourful sides."}
{"text":"Monday... by far the best night to parttake in all-you-can-eat crab or ribs. Why? It's simply not as busy on a Monday... Sundays I'm told are a bit nutty.  First up... drinks.   \"What goes well with crab?\" I asked. I'm no expert on crab... I didn't know if a cocktail would do the trick or if I should try a red or a white wine.  With no hesitation, our server responded, \"The Beam Lemonade!\" So decisive! So a Beam Lemonade it was.  I also ordered some deep fried pickles to start. They were hot and crunchy and came with dipping sauce (which tasted a lot like Thousand Island dressing, but I'm not 100% certain on that). The pickles were good, but I think ordering them was a mistake. See, I was there for all-you-can-eat crab and I think they seriously hindered the amount of crab that fit into my stomach.  The details: - All-you-can-eat-crab is available for $44.99 - All-you-can-eat-ribs are available for $28.95 - If one person gets the ribs and the other gets the crab, you're totally allowed to share. But if somebody at the table didn't order any of the all-you-can-eat plates, no sharing for them - Buckets of crab just start showing up at your table as you eat your way through the initial plate that shows up in front of you - You have your choice of a side... although really you're there for the crab, right?  We had little burners with melted butter to dip our crab in, except our side of the table didn't use ours. Is crab meat usually that sweet? Because it was mighty tasty!   I'm sure I'll be back again, but next time I'm eating vegetables the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"My gf's birthday was coming up so her hubby planned a surprised birthday for her at Booker's BBQ Grill & Crab Shack. I'm the type of person who likes to look at the menu ahead of time so I can drool over the menu and be excited about my selection. I've been eating quite well the last month..... eating well for me is pretty much no sweets (which is my all-time favorite) so when I found out we were going to Bookers, I was excited because seafood is just good for the diet.   It was Saturday evening around 7PM and there was no parking around the restaurant. They do offer some spots out in front but not a lot. It's a dead end so a lot of cars were leaving because there weren't any parking spots and it was a gong show because its right across the street from some condos. We ended up parking on the street and walking a little. I would totally recommend doing that.  We had a reservation for 15 people, we all arrived at different times and got seated right away. Drink orders were taken right away and we browsed the menu. I already knew I wanted either the crab and shrimp boil or the snow crab dinner. The market price for the snow crab dinner (1lb) was $~39. I decided to go with the snow crab dinner and it came with two sides. I went with the mashed potatoes and caesar salad. A couple of my friends were going to do the snow crab dinner but decided to do the ribs and add a side of snow crab.   Little dishes of melted butter lit with tea candles, seafood crackers and pickers were brought out to whoever ordered crab and all our food arrived in a timely manner which was great. Okay, I've never ordered snow crab ever in a restaurant so this was a first for me. I dug right in and started crack-a-lackin' the crab legs and boy was it ever time consuming. This was truly working for your meal and I was hungry so I didn't have the patience.  Thankfully I had sides because I could snack on them while I get my main source of protein out of these legs!! I was the only one who ordered the snow crab dinner and I instantly regretted not ordering the ribs then adding a side of crab because my friends seemed to be enjoying the ribs first while I was struggling getting the meat out of the crab legs. They made fun of me, especially because everyone was done their meals and there was me.... still diggin' for meat. I legit shouted at my gf who ordered the platter to share with her s/o and asked her to pass me some chicken.  I went with the dig most of the crab meat out, leave in butter and then eat method so I could get more than just a little bit at a time. I put the butter soaked crab into my mashed potatoes and ate it together which was yummy. I picked at the salad, the croutons were great. I think the croutons may have been bits of cornbread because it tasted a bit sweet. I really liked them.  Overall, the service was pretty good. Our girl topped up waters frequently and cleared the dishes as people finished. She was friendly and speedy. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals except my one friend who ordered the jambalaya said it was too spicy...I had a bite and indeed it was really spicy so they didn't finish that. My meal was good but really nothing out of this world. I definitely learned my lesson....to NOT order just snow crab for dinner when I'm starvin' marvin'."}
{"text":"This place is obviously not the place to go if you are a vegetarian but I came here for a work event. I am stuck between giving it a 2/5 because all I ate were fries, deep fried pickles, and coleslaw, and a 3/5 because I was starving so I still ate almost an entire platter of fries and they were alright. The deep fried pickles were just alright - I'm not sure I like the concept in general, and the coleslaw was meh. All my coworkers loved the copious piles of meat and giant halves of chicken and various other things that they pile onto their platters. I hear that the ribs were especially good, as were the chicken wings (I'm not actually sure if it was the wing part of the chicken). Obviously I will not be returning of my own accord but if you love meat you should definitely check it out so that non-meat eaters like me can shudder but also live vicariously through you!"}
{"text":"So I finally got a chance to check this place out and I gotta say it was pretty decent! Now before I continue I just wanna say if you don't like cheesy bluesy piano \"duals\" (as they are called) then you might want to avoid coming here on certain nights!   So the food was good, I tried the clam chowder (A little above average but a slight bit murky tasting), and pulled pork sandwich with a side of yam fries, and it was everything you would expect! nothing wrong with it but also I have had much better.It was a little over priced to (for what it was). I tried my buddies fish n chips, it was also pretty decent but again, nothing that blew me away. Now for me, I guess i have this idea that any place that calls itself a\" bbq\"  joint should have some kind of bbq item that makes you go \"wow!! this is really really good\" so I am judging by that standard but I will have to go back and try the ribs, the brisket and of  course the crab!   The menu seems stretched! and also if a place does crab and bbq, it probably means that one or the other or even both, will suffer a drop in quality.  So yeah I would say this place has a nice feel to it and delivers the goods! BUT i was a bit taken a back with the piano guys! Dont get me wrong the guys playing were actually quite talented players and singers but it was a little to loud for my taste (at least during eating time!) and we were as far away from the PA system as you could be!!   I had quite a hard time having conversation with my buddies! It actually kind of annoyed me! ( mainly the volume and the song choice :s) I am a snob, yes it is true ! hahaha, If only they would have played some bruce hornsby!!! something like \"spider fingers\" that would have made my night!! They basically \"hornsby- afied\" every song they played from U2 to rolling stones! You know what!  just bring down the volume 20 db! We can still hear you fine guys! hahahaha   Anyway props to the waitress who brought me a second bowl of clam chowder (on the house, probably just using the fat guy as a garberator!!! that chowder was gonna be dumped down the drain in a couple of hours anyway! hahaha)  Still a nice and appreciated gesture on her part!   Check it out its a good decent place!"}
{"text":"Booker's has been renovated since my last visit and even though I liked it just the way it was, the new decor is nice too.  I'm disappointed that they removed the fish tank and put in a full wall of TV's, though.  I don't know why so many places feel they must entertain their patrons this way.    I ate the Seared Salmon and thought it was delicious.  It's not for a sensitive palate, as the house made remoulade is super spicy.  It's a great combo with the salmon, which makes the dish a bit unique.  I really liked the coleslaw too.    My biggest disappointment was the server.  She wasn't very attentive, she walked away numerous times before we were done ordering and was tough to find when we needed something.  It was a Wednesday night and not busy.  There really was no excuse and for this reason along I'm in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for the AYCE Crab Sunday.  We made sure to make a reservation, glad we did as it was quite busy. $45 sounds like a lot of money but if you're confident (like I am) in your ability to put a hurt in this animal's sustainability, then it is really a bargain.  The crab was wonderfully sweet and brought to the table steaming hot! They made sure to keep it coming usually without any prompting by us. I got slaw with mine and it was actually pretty decent.  They never offered to bring more of the sides but I'm sure they would if asked.   I've seen a lot of negative reviews aimed at service so we were a bit wary. Our server was amazing, she never slowed down. She was bringing  drinks before we needed them and was quick to bring anything we asked for (lemons, more napkins, etc). And she was super friendly, a total asset to the business! We were even given farewells by the bar staff as we passed by to leave. A-1 experience tonight!"}
{"text":"Great spot best BBQ in Calgary, great wine list for BBQ spot and great selection of beers. Live entertainment on Friday and Sat. All you can eat Crab on Sunday! Unreal deal. The Vintage folks are behind this place, no wonder it's so good."}
{"text":"Restaurant is in an odd part of town but despite it's look from outside, it's worth it!    Menu is simple and has some great options.  We selected the crab cakes, combination platter, 1/2 lb of Crab Legs and a side of the Jalapeno Mac and Cheese.    With the combination platter, we selected the brisket and ribs.  Both were bbq'd to perfection and tasted great.  Sides were mashed potatoes, beans and corn.  The corn was sweet and perfectly buttered.  The 1/2lb of crab legs were delightful!  Loved working for the sweet crab meat.  The mac and cheese was quite heavy and I wasn' t a big fan of the jalapenos.  So I picked around them.    Their desserts are made in house and thus we tried the key lime cheesecake.  It was good - but the keylime part was only a sauce ontop.  Would have loved it throughout the cake or at least swimming in the sauce.  Fresh whipped cream was awesome!  Great place to catch a game and listen to a band.    Will return to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Ok, I want to say that I am giving this four stars in Calgary. If I was back home in Atlanta, I would probably take a star away in comparison to my other local BBQ/seafood places. That being said, I do think this place would stand up pretty well in the Georgia/Southern BBQ scene.   Before I get into the food, I will say that service is pretty slow. Our waitress came around very rarely and we showed up right after work, so the place was less than half full. That being said, I was with a group and we were having a good time chatting and drinking that I didn't really seem to notice.   Now on to the food...we ordered a little bit of everything on the menu (actually no one at my table got fish.) we shared the appetizer platter, some got the dry ribs, the brisket, the Mac and cheese, the chowder, the salad, and the beans. So I think we had a pretty good sampling of the menu. Also, about half of us have lived or traveled extensively in the Lousiana/Georgia/the Carolina's so this was not our first time around the block where BBQ is concerned.  The appetizer platter was great to share with a group of 6. We had a nice sampling as we also got try a little bit of everything without getting stuffed. The weakest part was the calimari; the breeding was good but flavourless. The ribs for the appetizer platter were also the more traditional/wet ribs whereas the plate is more of a dry rub so that was a nice mix.   Of all of our other dishes, we were pleasantly surprised by the flavour and tenderness. The mac and cheese was enjoyed by all and had a great consistency. The beef brisket was tender and blended perfectly with the salad. The only thing no one enjoyed were the beans. Other than that, we were all very happy with our meals.   There is also a room upstairs where you can put together tables and have a more private dinner/meeting for a good sized group. It is always nice to have that kind of option as it's not frequent.   Finally, parking is almost all street so just be aware that when you head down."}
{"text":"Ummmm, the beer I had was cold, that was the best part about my visit.  The jalapeno mac n cheese was tasty and the employees were very nice.  The \"crab meat\" that was delivered tasted like what I think a leather purse would taste like.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't even finish it and they served it with butter...I guess butter has it's limits too."}
{"text":"Booker's is in one of the worst parts of Calgary, and our recent visit lived up to all of the hype.  As we walked toward the building, cops were taking down a crackhead with guns drawn.  Once the guns were holstered, we continued toward the door, and were able to piece together that she had just stabbed another woman at the nearby drop-in center.  Once inside, Booker's is actually fairly nice.  As Jason mentioned, it appears to be a converted warehouse building.  It is roomy and has a bunch of televisions, which would be great for sporting events.  We were there for the all-you-can-ear crab legs.  We were a bit surprised to find out that the meal would be $38 each, but we all figured we would eat more than enough crab to justify the cost.  It took about 35 minutes after ordering before we saw our first crab legs.  That could have been because one in our party ordered a regular meal, so that's not so bad.  What was disappointing is the delay between when we finished each helping and the time the waitress brought us our next serving.  It was usually between 5 and 10 minutes, which is too long.  When we were eating, the crab was okay, although it was usually too salty.  Also, they were snow crab legs, which tastes good but doesn't yield the same reward as king crab.  The yam fries were delicious, although they came out lukewarm, at best.  The washrooms are upstairs, and I didn't see an elevator, so I wouldn't call this place wheelchair or elderly accessible.  If I returned to Booker's, I would probably order a regular meal next time."}
{"text":"Nothing beats the smell of the smoked meat! Seriously. Yeah I know it's weird!   Everything on the menu is fantastic!   The crab is always cooked just right, the appetizers are yummy (especially the burnt ends - seriously get them (Life. Changed)). They have 3 or 4 house barbecue causes - all delicious.  I'd say the only negative is the sides - and it's not that they are bad, but let's be honest you're going for the meat!"}
{"text":"The exterior implies some good ol' down home cooking right from the pit but walk through the doors and you get a dimly lit trendy looking bar/restaurant/lounge.  You can either sit at the bar to catch a hockey game, enjoy a dinner with friends or take in some live tunes.  Word of warning though: fridays consist of live piano cranked up full blast but if you like cheesy sing along hits than it could be good fun.  That being said the food was rather delicious.  The Booker's Burger is a jaw dropping towering heap of brisket, pulled pork, maple bourban on top of a overwhelmed but well seasoned patty.  It definitely requires a plan of attack since i don't think anyones mouth is that big.  Being a lover of all things meat I was left satisfied.  Service was adequate and pleasant though at times slow despite a seemingly quiet night.  All in all Booker's is a solid place to hang out and enjoy some decent BBQ.    P.S.  All you can eat baby back ribs on Mondays....need I say more?!"}
{"text":"Bookers seems to be a great place for birthdays and a quick bite before a movie at Eau Claire.  The beauty of Bookers is, there is something for everyone.  I had some non seafood lovers with me on Saturday and some big fans, and everyone left happy and full.  I avoided Bookers for about 2 years because of its location and look.  But I was stupid.  Stupid Meggy and your stupid judging a Bookers by its cover.  When you walk in, it's actually quite lovely looking.  Servers are dressed nicely, nice bar, and wonderful high bar stools and bar tables with a very industrial style ceiling.  Almost like a chic warehouse.  There is pretty good parking around the area, and usually free after 6 and on weekends. Tom was a great help in booking the 10 person dinner and returned my call promptly and pleasantly.    I have been to Bookers a few times now, this time the beans weren't AS good as they normally are, and the mashed potatoes are kind of plain (no skin on, not sure if they're garlic mashed or not).  But the Crabs legs 1/2 pound to start were to die for.  We have been here before when they've given us all claws, but this time we GOTZ SOME LEGZ!  My brother is still talking about the brisket and, I quote, \"When can we eat brisket again\".  And the answer, hopefully, is soon.  The brisket and honey maple sauce is super delicious.  Tender like you wouldn't believe.  My mom had the salmon which she also said was delicious.  Everyone seemed really happy with their meal.    Service wasn't VA VA VOOM but was decent enough, whenever I see an auto-grat of 18% I usually expect VA VA VOOM, but what can ya do.  The Big Taste Menu is on now for 25$ for a limited time only.  Those who ordered it enjoyed a Crab Cake Atlantic Rick crab meat, roasted red pepper aioli, Course 2: 1/4 rack of our smokehouse St Louis ribs, 5 oz of our house smoked brisket, garlic mashed potato, maple chipotle corn on the cob AND Course 3: Raspberry Lime Cheesecake (Which they were out of so substituted with a brownie sundae)  If you find yourself hungry with a hankerin' for bbq or crab, head on down to BOOKERS, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Met a friend there from out of town with high hopes. Was relatively unremarkable. The service wasnt the best ( and it wasnt busy) food was nothing special really, atmosphere was decent. If you're looking for BBQ or smoked meat go to Hayden Block and dont waste time here. Overall it wasnt terrible, but personally wouldnt go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this restaurant with the group. Very nice environment, like music which was very nice. The prices for the food are a little above average considering it isn't very good, my burger was so burnt it was barely edible, and the others that had ribs weren't huge fans, but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"While in Calgary this weekend, we went to Bookers on 4/28/18. We arrived just after opening and were seated quickly at a high top. Our server Cyndi was fantastic. We started with burnt ends as an appetizer (these are fantastic) as I wanted to compare to Bbq I have had in the southern states. They held up. We then ordered 2, 2 meat combos. 1 with brisket, ribs, coleslaw and beans. The other with smoked wings, ribs soup and asparagus. The brisket was very good, coleslaw a little heavy on pepper but good and the beans tasted like tomato soup to me. The soup and asparagus are fabulous, the wings very small and dry. The ribs had a heavy dry rub (chalky) taste to them but once you put the homemade KC Style sauce on them they are passable. I will return and try the pulled pork and seafood next trip. A fun place to go"}
{"text":"Hey Crab lovers and Rib lovers, this is the place for you!  All you can eat crabs for $39.95/person and All you can eat ribs for $28.95/person at Bookers only on Sundays and Mondays.    We decided to try both the crabs and ribs all you can eat specials.  You get refillable sides of cajun rice, beans and coleslaw with these specials.    For those who ate the crabs, you get 2 things of steamed snow crab legs on a metal plate and comes with melted butter.  The dish of melted butter is kept hot with a candle going under the dish.  Once you are ready for more crab, just let your waitress know and the buckets of crab legs keep coming out!  Actually, our waitress was pretty good and she kept checking the table to see if we need more food.    For the rib special, you get a full rack of pork ribs and we tried the original sauce which is the Kansas style.  Delicious and moists ribs but not the fall-off-the bone type.  You have to actually chew on the meat a bit so if you can't pull on the ribs, don't eat these!  The waitress told me that the ribs aren't boiled but smoked.  Kansas ribs have a dry rub on them.  We also tried the other kinds of ribs - Carolina - a tangy one - not too bad & Maple Bourbon - a little on the sweet side.   Let me say that the crab legs and ribs kept on coming till we were full up!  We enjoyed our dinner very much and wish that the restaurant would have this special every day!    My only pet peeve is the washroom.  They are upstairs and the stairs are pretty steep to get up and down.  If the restaurant would consider making a set of washrooms on the main floor, I would certainly give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for the price, feels like a good place to watch football on a Saturday.  The meat portions are substantial - likely would not get the combo again, just stick to one.  The ribs were really good, dinosaur size!  Bartender was super friendly, realized we were waiting for a seriously long time so popped out from behind the bar and handled our drink/good owners personally - great move by him but why is that needed?  Place must've been at 40% capacity...."}
{"text":"Loud. Crowded. Stinky. Filthy. No parking unless you are lucky. Rehabs all around you. Dark. Yet...  I'd say, if you are looking for a beer - it's ok. Food is also ok. Not \"wow\", but ok. There is also live music. And I did not have a chance to try the seafood, but can't say I expect to miss something special - judging by the rest.  In a sense, if you absolutely need to get into this type of place in this particular part of the city, Booker's it is then.  My only question would be, who in their right mind would like to have fun in that (rather nasty) corner of Calgary? I know people actually live there, and feel sorry for them - so maybe Booker's actually make their life feel a bit better? Good then."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday for the all you can eat crab and ribs to celebrate a birthday.   It was pretty busy, but they sure know how to handle crowds.   The service was prompt, and all business, as servers and busboys went from table to table clearing the carnage of rib bones and crab carcasses.     The crabs and ribs were so delicious, we were in a meat coma all night.   It was a really fun night out for a birthday, and we will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"We went there last night for dinner with the in-laws. We shared some wings and crab cakes. The crab cakes were good but I found a little pricey. I tried the sangria with red wine, I was a little disappointed it wasn't chilled really. Is nice that you can get it in bigger quantities like 1/2 lt or full.  I had the pound of snow crab legs with mac and cheese and corn bread. The mac and cheese was really good, I like the spice of the jalapeno. The crab legs was good I forgot how much work they are. Overall not a bad place. I found the leather couches a little uncomfortable since I have shorter legs so I felt like I was sloaching over the table to disassemble my shells"}
