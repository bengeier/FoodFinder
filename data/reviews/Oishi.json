{"text":"There were 5 of us who tried Oishi.  All of us loved our appetizers and dishes.  No wait.  Great service.  The wine was excellent as well.  The atmosphere was really nice.  Not very many people in the restaurant.  It might tend to be loud if there is a crowd.  But what restaurant isn't these days!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here.  As one reviewer mentioned, their presentations are excellent.  The soup was just OK, and I thought the ginger dressing on the salad tasted bitter, but the entree and sushi made up for it.  The sushi roll was so beautifully presented with separate little plates and bowls for individual dipping.  I especially enjoyed the ginger sauce on the ginger chicken I ordered.  YUMMM!!!!  I absolutely have never had any ginger sauce this good.  They added some unusual items, like cubes potatoes and eggplant, to the stir-fry.  Surprisingly, it worked!   The portions were generous and prices are really reasonable.  You get so much food for the money.  I enjoyed the atmosphere--very classy.  I felt like I had dined \"fine\" on a very inexpensive ticket.  I really hope they stay in business.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The worst service. The owner has absolutely no clue how to make customers happy. Even though we had a reservation, he refused to seat our party until all 18 has arrived. Since some were late we weren't seated until 30 minutes later than our reservation time. Most of us would have preferred drinks and appetizers. He could've been making some money. Rather, we waited an additional half hour before we were assigned a waitress, and that was only after I asked for one.  After an hour and a half we finally were served our dinner. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Decor is beautiful nice relaxed atmosphere. Salad comes with your choice of dressing....I opted for the ginger dressing....very bitter after-taste...not good at all.  The waiter was not that friendly/attentive...she was more busy eating her food a couple tables away.  I got the lunch chirashi for about 11.50 and 2 rolls for 8.50 which was an excellent price (spicy salmon and tuna) .  If you don't mind unattentive waitresses then this place isn't to bad for lunch.  Dinner prices seem expensive."}
{"text":"AMAZING is all I have to say!! Food was outstanding, service was perfect and prices were unbeatable. I can safely say it is the best sushi restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Not fresh food, the \"look\" of the restaurant is ok (kind of like a copy cat Ko Fusion) but the quality of food is just bad...it has to be old...no reason to be so chewy. Also they really need to clean this place. Leftover food from previous tables on the table and walls. Not a good look, I don't recommend. Go to Ko Fusion"}
{"text":"This place is racist, which is ironic since they serve Japanese food in here. We came here for a group dinner. We paid a tip at around 12-15% at the end. One waitress came and say \"next time please tip above 18%. I know no tip in China, but This is United States. If u wanna good food and good service u need to pay more. I used to work in a Chinese restaurant and they put tip amount in the check. We are not like that so u need to tip at least 18%. That's how it works here.\" I told her I am offended. She said \"we r very busy. (Which is not true, at the time they only have two other tables) No time talk. If u r done, I will collect dishes now.\"  I am very shocked by the attitude and the words she had said. I definitely would not come here again and I do not recommend their food that much either."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed this evening. A party of eight of us were there to celebrate 2 birthdays....one of which was our 80 year old grandma. Once our bill came, exceeding $200, we were charged for a \"birthday\". We asked the manager as they were trying to rush us out and he said it was for the birthday cake. We explained that we were never informed of this surcharge as we've never been charged for a birthday before! He said we have to charge you for one if your bill is under $100. Obviously it was over. We also had a $10 coupon that they only redeemed for $5. The manager proceeded to argue with us even after we expressed our waitress never informed us of this charge. He then turned and walked away. This is no way to build repeat customers and quite embarrassing to have to deal with in front of birthday guests! We won't be back"}
{"text":"Ridiculously terrible service received on Friday evening. Should give zero or minus star if possible. I've being to the restaurant hundreds of times and received good food and friendly service. However, the waitress who seats me on Friday, whom I never even met before and claimed to be working all the time insisted that I must follow her instruction and sit at some strange corner which is cold and refused my request for change in seat (which never ever happened in my experience at the restaurant), claiming that those seats are 'reserved' when I see no sign of 'reservation'. When I insisted to make a seat change, she showed great impatience and anger and tell me to ask manager. I left the restaurant immediately since I have no mood in eating anymore. The waitress totally ruined my evening. The worst waitress ever! She simply destroyed the reputation of such a good restaurant. I suggest the restaurant fire her immediately. Otherwise I won't go and will strongly discourage all my friends go and be treated terribly at the restaurant. If you really love the food there, which I agree to be fantastic, avoid Friday and Saturday, which is the time the terrible waitress claimed as 'always working on'."}
{"text":"I've gone to Oishi about 5 times, always invited by friends, because I'm not into sushi and would not otherwise choose this type of place.  It's been the same story every time, but this is my first review.  I figured if the place is so consistently bad at customer service 5 times in a row, it would be fair to review them poorly.  Ive gotten chicken and steak each time and it's been great each time, but honestly it's hard to screw up if you're one, a chef, and two, just grilling plain steak and chicken and shoveling it onto the customers plate.  They also grill veggies and rice all together and then portion it out to all at the grill.  I liked the food and the chef did cool tricks to show off each time I was there.  Nothing to complain about there.  My wife and friends had the sushi and didn't seem overly impressed, but none of us are food snobs so they didn't complain and we were having fun watching the chef cook.  The problem has always been the actual wait staff.  They take your order, bring your first drink, and then you don't see them until they bring your check.  The last time I was there, just 3 days ago, I ordered a beer and it was brought out pretty quick.  I didn't chug it down by any means, but it was pretty much empty before the hibachi chef even got to our grill.  My waiter never came back to check on us the entire time.  I didn't even get a water.  I ate my entire meal with nothing to drink.  I tried to wave him down several times, but it was almost like he was purposely avoiding looking our direction.  We all finished our meals except one friend who had been tending to his 9 month old son while his wife ate.  Now he had passed the child off so he could finish his meal.  I figured I'd still order a second beer to wait on my friend and just conversate with everyone since we don't see them much.  I decided to just get up and go find the waiter.  As soon as I stood up he emerged from the back like he was watching and waiting and asked if I was ready for my check.  It's like they think they need to flip tables as fast as possible.  Only problem was the place was nearly empty and it was 6 pm.  I would have ordered several drinks had he ever bothered to come back during the meal as would all of my friends.  And their drinks are expensive so they would have made probably more money off drinks than the overly expensive food.  Needless to say it was disappointing to pay over $70 for me and my wife to eat average food and get terrible service.  This is why we don't go out to eat often anymore.  It's too frustrating to put up with servers who don't even try.  We end up angry and pay a lot of money for it.  Also, the seats were all ripped up and it just looked overall run down and unclean.  I assume management isn't too experienced or just not motivated. I'm done giving them my money. There are plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"ADY is an awesome chef and extremely funny.   Highly recommended restaurant.  The food is excellent.   Very entertaining.   4 children under 7 were with us.  They enjoyed.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great service, great fresh food, and their lunch menu prices are fantastic. There is never a problem when I go here. We have made this our weekly Sunday treat. Fantastic!  There is also delivery and pick up and your first online order is 10% off. I have ordered a couple times and it is always fast and the driver is always extremely friendly. People that said that service is not that good need to try again. I have always thought the service is A+!   And there is free Wifi. My girlfriend goes there sometimes to study and have green tea."}
{"text":"Went with friends to a teppanyaki table. If you've been to a Benihana or similar you know the drill: food related puns e.g. \"egg roll\", the onion volcano, challenging diners to catch flipped up food with their mouths, etc. The experience is fun.  The food itself was underwhelming. Steaks, shrimp and fish are all well overcooked, resulting in rubbery shrimp, and dry, tasteless steaks and salmon. The cook pours waaay too much soy sauce on the food, destroying what little remains of the flavor. It was almost too salty to eat. The soy sauce itself tastes and smells like a discount \"soy\" sauce of salty water with caramel coloring. I don't expect 5 star dining in Champaign, but skimping on soy sauce is just weird.  I give an extra star because they're very willing to split an order into two plates."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation, and the staff who answered made a mistake. When I called back to check on my reservation I got yelled at and told \"there is nothing I can do.\" Terrible service. Needless to say my reservation has been lost and my,dinner plans ruined. Very very unhappy. It is never,ok,to yell at a customer over the phone"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant twice now. The food is delicious, the service is great and they have the best strawberry margaritas I have ever had! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A concept restaurant that tries to be trendy Pan-Asian, and succeeds on the urban aesthetics but was disappointing with what matters most - the food. Our family of four tried a variety of dishes. One of us (who is happy with rice and chicken wings) enjoyed his meal. The rest of us felt, well, \"meh\".   But first, here is what was good: (1) the beer was cold and typically priced - no drafts here, though. (2) our steamed broccoli and broccoli with brown sauce was perfectly cooked. (3) the food was nicely presented on white china.  And now the rest. Our waitress was quite eager to please but was woefully unprepared and poorly trained. The chicken wings were artfully presented on a bed of lettuce leaves nestled on a long white rectangular plate. As soon as it hit the table, my son and I couldn't help but start laughing and what had to be the smallest wings we had ever seen! My other son's \"pink lobster\" sushi sounded great - but tasted dull and uninteresting. My wife had some standard sushi - tuna and yellowtail - but the fish seemed rather tasteless and the rice seemed to be made of long-grain Chinese style rice rather than the traditional short-grain, and did not hold together well.  This is inexcusable for a sushi restaurant. I had the sesame seared tuna on buckwheat soba noodles marinated in peanut sauce  topped with nori and some kind of wasabi aioli. Sounds great, right? The fish was nicely seared but still raw in the middle, but the flavors were a mess. Instead of enhancing the taste of the fish (which was not very tasteful), they overpowered it in a clash of confusing flavors that competed rather than complemented.  So disappointing, especially considering the prices. For our family, there is no reason to return."}
{"text":"Fair service, mediocre food. The lunch options are a steal, but I wouldn't recommend the sushi."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Oishi!  Last night, I walked in right as they were closing.  And, they still gave me good service and great food!  Everything tasted great and the atmosphere surrounding the cocktail bar was the best!    If I could split things up in three I would give the service 1.67, food  1.66 and the ambience 1.67.  The reason I gave the 1.66 for the food, is because the portions of soup and salad are small however cheaper than any other place I have been.  The amount of wonton soup and seaweed salad was a tease.  But, very tasteful!  Maybe if the price was .50 cents  more they could give a few more bites.  I still HIGHLY recommend Oishi.  It is convenient for where I live and the building is clean and fairly new!   The price for my plate of a 3 sampler tuna rolls, 2 piece wonton soup, and very small cup of seaweed salad with water to drink was $25, $30 after tip.  This puts this restaurant in a Spendy range for Champaign according to Yelp.  I am not sure if you include tip in the price range.  Any input on the price calibration would be great!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't even give this place a star if it was possible. The worst customer service I've ever seen. Short staffed is an understatement their staff doesn't know how anything about time management. Never again."}
{"text":"I recommend this place strictly for the hibachi experience. The wait was about an hour to get a table. Once we were at our table we then waited another twenty minutes for drinks. However, once we got our chef there, it was quite the show!! No word but entertaining would describe it. The chef was personable, funny, and interacted well with the whole table. All of the food was fantastic. It is a lot of food! To make things better, they discounted our meal due to the long wait. So I respect that. I will go back but only for the hibachi grill. I won't go to sit at a regular table."}
{"text":"I came here just for sushi takeout but the woman was very polite and they had everything packaged up really nicely the second I walked in the door less than 20 min after I called in my order and drove over :)   I got the sashimi dinner. The 16 pieces of fish were nice and thick and delicately flavored. You get your money's worth for just $18."}
{"text":"The lady (probably the owner) had really bad attitude. Everything tasted like the same. One of my worst experiences."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place negative stars, I would.  I had a similar experience to other reviews in terms of customer service.  My husband and I ate here for the first time.  I ordered several different sushi rolls to share.  When the sushi came out, the fish was pureed and the texture was not pleasing to the palate.  I began explaining to the server that I did not know that the fish would be served like this but was met with an aggressive voice.  I kept the food and attempted to eat it, but even the veggie tempura roll, which had no fish, was not good.  Both my husband and I felt that we simply could not eat the sushi.   My husband called the waitress back over and explained that the sushi is not very good and we could not eat it.  She became even more aggressive, stated that she was going to get a manager.  She went over to a woman at the hostess station and was talking about me in plain sight.  It was obvious that this was going to be problematic.  The woman came over and was immediately aggressive.  She stated that I got the food that I ordered and I should have asked how the sushi was made and that we would pay for half.  She became so aggressive that I had to ask her to stop speaking to me unprofessionally and stated that I would be placing a review online.  She eventually left the table following my pleas for her to leave.  I expected that she was a manager, since the server stated that she would get a manager, but then she stated that she would get a manager.  I never met the manager, but this women who was neither a manager or our waitress returned to the table stating that it was removed from the bill but left the sushi at the table.  After 10 minutes, this woman returned clarifying that we did not want the sushi and removed the dish.  It seemed as though they felt we were trying to get free food and would then eat it once it was removed from the bill.  It was beyond their ability to accept and recognize that in comparison to other restaurants in town that their food is subpar.   The waitress then went to the kitchen and was complaining about me so loud that I and everyone else in the dining room could hear her.  I could not get out of this restaurant fast enough.  I will never go back and would advise going to KoFusion, Sushi Kame, or My Thai for quality sushi and professional and kind service.  If money is tight, try buying your sushi grade fish at AmKo and in the comfort of your home, experiment with making your own sushi rolls.  If you would like to create the same experience as Oishi, put your fish in a blender with bland sauce, roll it in half cooked rice and have someone berate you through the entire process."}
{"text":"Picked up a dinner from here to bring back to the hotel, so I can't comment much on service or the experience of dining in here.   The wonton soup was just plain sad with only 2 wontons in it and little else. The sweet potato roll was average. The ginger chicken was quite good - saved the meal a bit, but not enough to get me coming back."}
{"text":"i still like oishi's food... but after eating in the dining room a couple of times in the last few weeks.... the service has brought my original rating down a notch.    the hostess/cashier at the front door.... is always doing something besides what she should be doing when i walk in.  it's kind of off putting.  in three times i have been there to eat in the last 5 weeks, she has been reading a book at the front desk... feet propped up, like we are eating in her library.  one time, i stood in front of the counter, and three minutes passed before she looked up at me.  three minutes... a short time to wait for a cab.... but a rather long time to stand in front of someone who should notice you immediately.     the wait staff.... sigh.  another disappointment.  today, for instance, my party and i arrived at a little past 5pm for dinner.  oishi advertises twenty percent off for those who dine between 4-5:30pm.  awesomeness.  we were ready for our discount.  we ate, drank, and were generally merry.  our waiter was friendly enough, but screwed up our order.  he rectified it, and we were happy enough.  he continually came back to our table, twice reaching right across my plate AS I WAS EATING to take my glass for a refill.  i don't mind the refill.  really.  it's great.  however, i do mind your foreign arm in my dinner plate.  i don't even put my own arm in my dinner plate.   the check came.  no early bird discount.  another in my party pointed it out to the waiter.  he looked at us with a blank stare for a moment, and mumbled something about his manager.  my friend again pointed out that we had dined between the discount hours, and he then asked us if \"we were sure.\"  are we sure?  yeah, and you can be too because you WAITED ON US.  my friend pointed out that he had totaled our bill at 5:33pm... and unless he took our order, served us, and we ate it in 3 minutes... we'd made the cut off.  he was still confused, but took our bills anyway and took the discount off.     the wait staff seem unsure about how to really serve people, and some of them are just generally unprofessional.  the decor would suggest this place is trying to be upscale, but the service just doesn't live up to it."}
{"text":"Waiter did not speak english the first time I went.  He messed up a food allergy order.  Second time I tried again, waitress did not speak english.  No one speaks english at this establishment.  Sushi is sub par."}
{"text":"Ambience is fun and eclectic, the food choices are basic and fusion at best. You can eat for $8 a plate up to $40 a plate. They also serve a few fun drinks--with lighted glasses and fresh flowers.  The wait staff leaves something to be desired however, and the noise of the heating and cooling take away from the prestige of the decor."}
{"text":"I like their sushi a lot, and their crab rangoon is solid. Some of their other dishes are kind of meh.   They wind up on CiSaves a lot, so what we usually get for the price is fantastic. I'm not sure if I would continue to go there otherwise."}
{"text":"Dined at lunchtime. The miso soup tasted a lot like a mouthful of ocean water, only somehow more fishy. The house Ginger salad dressing was pasty and bitter. The sushi had a mealy texture. The service was good. The food was not."}
{"text":"It took 50 min for the hibachi chef to show up at our table.. No apologies, no explanation, poor service."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant. I was so sick after my meal and so were my friends! We ate habachi and sushi and felt so sick. We will never go back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite hibachi restaurant! The staff is very attentive and the chefs are amazing. They put on quite a show while cooking but this does not compromise the taste of the food. I highly recommend the filet!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and it was great!   My steak was cooked perfectly and their rice is amazing!  Our tae chef was a blast and seemed like he was having just as much fun as us.  Our waitress did a great job as well.  In spite of a few people in our group acting obnoxiously, she remained calm and professional.    This review is downgraded to 4 stars because my beef and onion side of soup literally had 3 small onion slivers and the rest was beef broth.    That aside great food, service and the chef we had was awesome!  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"ok, so trying a sushi restaurant on a Sunday afternoon might not be the best idea (everyone knows that fish is delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays in this part of the mid-west)... Decor=excellent.  Service=Excellent. Value for money=exceptional (I'm thinking of my friends who like quantity in this line).  Food...well...variable.  The crab cakes are made with fake crab, and are actually delicious, but I wish they would fess up about it. The sushi itself tasted pre-frozen, which in this part of the world is understandable, but it just wasn't great. Sushi rolls were better, so I look forward to trying more of their 'cooked' food!. I wish them best of luck..."}
{"text":"If you go for lunch it is extremely well priced! I love their food and every part of the hibachi experience, I have thought that all the staff is very friendly and helpful. We never wait around for them to bring our checks or or cards after. They always bring refills on the drinks quickly or before you even finish the drink. I have had sushi here only twice and it wasn't that great but thats not what I would go to Oishi for. Love the yum yum sauce and rice!"}
{"text":"This is a friend's favorite place, so we tried coming here once and the wait was way too long. This time we came at an off time, mid afternoon on Sunday and there was no wait. We did the hibachi and had very good food. We shared the table with others. Our server cooked each person's food to their liking and everyone seemed happy. I had tofu with veggies and it was very good. One friend did not care for the scallops but that was a personal dislike. The only negative was the amount of soy sauce makes the food very salty."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience there tonight. My server was Lynn, she was agitated and rude from the beginning. I tried to be nice and understanding at first as I figured maybe they were understaffed and she was stressed? I had ordered a martini prior to ordering food. Lynn stopped by and said it would be a couple minutes after a few minutes. After about 20 minutes I went to the host stand as I did not see my server and asked if she knew where my drink was. Several minutes later Lynn came with the drink very angry, and asked \"you don't want this anymore?!\" I told her I had asked the host where it was. Lynn then yelled \"I asked you if you could wait a couple minutes and you said yes!\" I told Lynn it had been 20, and that it was fine I didn't need the drink now (as rude as she was, keep it). Lynn yanked the drink away spilling some of it and leaving in a big huff. She checked on us once towards the end of the meal. Upon paying and leaving, I asked to speak to a manager to inform them about the service as so this wouldn't happen to someone else. The manager was at the host station in jeans and a T-shirt and said his name was jingo or something? He wouldn't look at me, and when I told him we received really poor service he said \"ya, ok.\" And I said we were yelled at, and he kind of waived his hand and kept working on whatever he was working on up front. A mere apology and \"we will handle it\" would have been expected. Absolutely worst restaurant experience I can recall. I had went out to eat to enjoy myself, and was really looking forward to a drink at the end of the day. I will say, their food is good. But your gambling if you go there on the experience you will have."}
{"text":"Very good! Never had a bad meal yet. I've been coming here since they opened & I'm so happy they have stayed around! Best crab Rangoon in the area, hands down!! General Tao's chicken is also very tasty! Some other reviews say, \"if I wanted good sushi/hibachi grill I would've gone to KO fusion/ Kamakura\" my reply to those comments is...really!? This place has everything those other places have to offer & they are just as good! It's also nice for those who want to change things up or don't want to drive as far as the other places. Def a place to try if craving Thai/sushi/hibachi!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Springfield. It was a good find. We sat at the bar and I ordered the lunch special. Three rolls with the salad with the ginger dressing. I really enjoyed the dressing - had a creamier consistency than I'm used to. Could have used a little more ginger flavor though. I ordered pretty standard rolls; tuna, spicy crunchy tuna and shrimp tempura. All were good; the spicy crunchy tuna was a little underwhelming though. It wasn't very spicy or crunchy. Tuna was whipped into a paste-like consistency too. Overall, a good find in Champaign. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sushi was meh. Overpriced and the quality definitely wasn't worth it. Great service though"}
{"text":"I was that person that stated I would never try sushi. I was missing out! I admit I'm not into the authentic sushi yet; I'm still working my way through tempura's and slowly ordering out of my comfort zone. If sushi isn't what you want, they offer cooked Chinese dishes (sweet & sour chicken, beef & broccoli, etc.) and other items. Their menu is quite extensive. A fun place to gather with a group of friends, everyone order something different and share to see what you like!"}
{"text":"We just love their Singapore thin noodles and vegetarian rolls.  Ambience is great and food tastes nice. Reasonable Priced, the only downside is the service is so so."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Like usual.  Elaine is wonderful.  Hot.   Fresh.   Clean.  Delish.  We always share."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch. We had three different sushi rolls and fried rice. All were delicious. Service was good and quick. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Champaign. Prices are on par with other restaurants but the selection and portion size are outstanding. Not to disparage their Miso soup but you should really try their Hibachi soup!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a friend told me they had a good experience.  I'm glad I picked up an order to go, because if I was in the dining in, I'd probably had an involuntary scene.   The sushi was inedible. This is no joke. I've had better sushi at Meijer. The only reason why I gave this place two stars and not one, was the crab Rangoon was pretty good. Although anything tasted better than the sushi. Needless to say, I threw the sushi away and made a 5 stars pb&j."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are regular Oishi patrons. We've only ever sat at the Hibachi tables and have enjoyed the show every time. I always order the chicken (I dont eat any seafood or sushi) and he typically gets either the shrimp and scallops or chicken and scallops. We LOVE the orange sauce, or as they call it 'sexy sauce' that they give you to go with your meal. The food is always delicious, and the atmosphere is nice. I will agree with some of the other comments about the customer service. It isn't terrible, the chefs and the wait staff are generally pretty friendly and attentive. However, the last time we were there (and almost every time we go) we have to wait a good 3-5 minutes before anyone comes to the host stand to seat us. It's a little frustrating, but when they do come they're nice. Overall, we love Oishi and will continue to go there!"}
{"text":"I don't think the reviews give this place enough credit. I though the service was good and the food was even better. It's so close to my apartment that it's dangerous! I had Shrimp On Fire sushi roll and I think it was the best sushi I have had and I'm a huge sushi lover. I also got steak and shrimp hibachi. Steak was tender. Fried rice was so yummy! And the yum yum sauce was to die for! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi!  Best crab rangoon in Champaign.  The hot and sour soup is also my favorite in Champaign.  Consistently good.  The sushi is a great deal at lunch time - they have some good lunch specials."}
{"text":"The general shoes chicken is good and the chines Nodles  are excellent the staff was good to us and the service was good. I will be returning to Oishi agin."}
{"text":"My family of four were first time patrons last night since we were unable to get a reservation at Kamakura.  Serendipity proved to be a great opportunity in this case.  We dined at the Hibachi grill...everyone enjoyed the soup, salad with ginger dreassing, as well as the calamari, sirloin, scallops, prime rib, and chicken we had as our respective main courses.  Our Hibachi chef was fantastic!  Think of Oishi as a modern day Benihana.  I thought the prices nery very reasonable.  My only suggestion for management would be to do more frequent rounds on both the exterior and interior... There was trash strewn at the main entry to the restaurant and cleaning of the interior detail cleaning needs to be more thorough."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp tempura and the crab rangoons. Always my go to place for good sushi."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service was fast and friendly. The let me order off the kids menu, which a lot of places don't let you do that. Had the shrimp and it was perfectly cooked and just great. Still couldn't eat it all. I highly recommend coming here and we will be back."}
{"text":"Oishi was just good for me. It wasn't great. The server was attentive and nice. The atmosphere was chill, but kind of confusing. It's like in between romantic because of the lighting and I don't even know what with the tv turned to espn. That, however, wasn't bothersome.  I ordered sushi and it was good, just not great. I like to order certain rolls at different restaurants just to be able to compare and Oishi's wasn't too bad. The food is definitely pleasing to the eye, but the taste wasn't exceptional. It was just good.  However, their rolls are sufficient for the price. I ordered unagi ($2 ea) and the pieces of eel was really big! I was pleasantly surprised but, again, didn't love the taste. Just felt like there could be more to it."}
{"text":"Had a sushi lunch platter.  Price was about 9.50... I had wonton soup which was a bit too salty.  I also ordered shrimp shumai which was decent.  The presentation of the sushi was stunning.  It came with 1 shrimp, two salmon, two yellowtail and one tuna and a california roll. The fish is fresh as is the rice...but I don't think the rice is seasoned at all with rice vinegar which makes for so-so sushi.  Not a bad place for sushi but not the greatest I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had the seafood lover with miso soup and salad  The ambient trys to be sofisticated and romantic however with several 42 inch screens showing the sport of fashion doesn't make it  The food was Really good and it was enough to share between me and my lovely wife   The service was very nice, the food came fast and tasty."}
{"text":"Apparently this is one of the hottest restaurants in the area?  It's VERY average quality and has quite high prices for what it is.  Their sushi rolls are ones with lots of mayo and tempura.. (*very americanized-type sushi // basic sushi eaters*). Japanese food is my favorite cuisine and I'm unimpressed, but if you are basic, you might like it!  Their pork chop dish was alright, but again, nothing to actually write home about..? After I left, I realized the waitress didn't even bring me my miso soup. WTF.  Granted, for Champaign-Urbana standards, I guess it's okay.. so I will add a star.  I honestly wouldn't be impressed if I was taken here on a date. Lol"}
{"text":"Just save yourself and skip this one. The seasoning was all wrong on the hibachi and just greasy. Plus when the egg was cooked the flat top was too hot or something because the egg started burning right away. You know that disgusting smell when you accidentally spill egg on to the stove and it burns? Yeah well that was mixed into the rice and it went downhill from there. The guy cooking everything kept putting sauces into the food trying to mask the taste. I had to have a re-do on my meal because it was burned to a crisp on the grill. It tasted like burning. Thankfully they didn't charge me double but my re-do wasn't much better but at least it was kind of edible? Also I got vegetables and tofu but there was shrimp! I asked the guy why my vegetarian meal had shrimp in it and he said it just comes with two shrimps. I'm not vegetarian but heck this place was kind of sketchy and I didn't want to get food poisoning from the fish! Also that tofu wasn't tofu... Nope not coming back."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite hibachi grills. The last few times I have visited it hasn't been the greatest and I thought tonight let's try it one more time. I was very disappointed. Service was TERRIBLE. Food was mediocre. Definitely not spending any more of my money here."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat!!!! Loved it! I went for lunch today with my husband and 9 year old son. It was my sons first time at a hibachi grill, and he had the best time. He asked to go back before they even brought the bill. The chef ( a gentlemen named ritchie)  was wonderful!!!! He even came back out to talk to my son after the meal to make sure he had a good time. I will definitely be going back again and again! Thank you very much for making my sons 4th of July even better!"}
{"text":"Oishi has improved so much recently! It can get pretty busy during the dinner rush, so sometimes service is a bit slow then, but everything else totally makes up for it.  Great food, especially the sushi. I recommend coming during lunch for the super-reasonable prices. Hibachi is so much fun and the food there is great as well.  Some of my favorite dishes: hibachi lunch (salmon and steak are both great, you get soup & salad & hibachi rice & vegetables & your meat of choice cooked in front of you), some of their fancier sushi rolls (lobster roll!!, jimmy's sexy roll), sashimi dinner. One time, we got the shrimp tempura for \"dessert\" and it was perfect. 5 super-crispy shrimp tempura with the most amazing coconut sauce!   Love this place. If you take one thing away from my review, try the hibachi lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday.   So right off the bat this place does do hibachi lunch specials on Saturday. 8.99 for chicken hibachi lunch is a fair price and I think if they charged anymore I would not come back. The service was fast, the room is very open and a little loud when there is a crowd. The portion was incredibly small and a little bit of a disappointment. The saving grace of this place is their yummy ginger salad dressing. Overall a pretty average hibachi place, with average to play food."}
{"text":"Good, not great.  Everything was fresh, but just needed a little something to make you say 'yum'.  My friends Z & A weren't much on sharing, so I can only say my food was good."}
{"text":"The food is just so-so compared to other Japanese restaurants in Champaign-Urbana; and they are not cheap. I was having a dinner with my colleagues and I don't think I'd come again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but the guy checking people in is so rude. We have been going there for years always great! However this time he ruined the night also my sons bday and they had the nerve to charge $5.00 for a desert no one ate just not right if you are going to charge ask what we would want!!!"}
{"text":"We have always loved and given our business to Oishi. Lately it has not been so phenomenal. The last straw was when we tried to make a reservation for THIRTEEN people to celebrate a birthday. They would not take the reservation, said the wait would be long. We were planning on coming from out of town for this specifically. Non apologetic nor were they polite about it. It's okay. We'll take our what would have been over a $450 bill to a different place of business."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Oishi to eat sushi and sashimi. The food was delicious and the service was fast. Our waiter was extremely nice!"}
{"text":"Service was poor, food was mediocre, and my wife and I were both violently ill the next day. Steer clear"}
{"text":"First hibachi experience and it was such a fun time. The food was excellent and well priced for how much you get. Our cook was entertaining and attentive. Definitely plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their salmon and steak hibachi combo. Also try the chicken tempura rolls as your appetizer if you go. I recommend just sitting at a regular table, you'll get you food way faster and you could still the hibachi show next to your table."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but it's just ok. The food is pretty good but not wowing. The service is decent, but the facility is reminiscent of a Vegas buffet that's been relocated in Branson, MO.  The owners don't really seem to care about it as the lot looks abandoned from all the weeds and the stone falling off of the building facade."}
{"text":"The hibatchi grill is fun and delicious! Go during lunch hours for decent pricing. The staff are friendly and inviting, have never had a problem with customer service."}
{"text":"This is review will be covering the Hibachi grill, only.   If you do hibachi get the filet mignon and salmon or scallops. Ginger salad, with the hot and sour soup. I go here all the time for this and it has been consistent every time and delicious. There is also a coupon you can get for this establishment, usually comes in as a flier. i believe its spend $50 dollars get $10 off or the $25 and get $5 off.  Great deal and good food. If you can try to avoid the busy hours, as service falls a bit there.  The regular dine in looks questionable and the sushi, at your own risk."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. I've been here several times & tried both the sushi & hibachi grill. The wait staff was nice but the food quality was lacking. For sushi, I like the Ocean 14 special roll. For most part, the roll has been consistently good. For sashimi, I like the scallops (hotate) but sometimes their fish isn't fresh. Their lunch specials are a decent deal for the price but I found some of the entrées too salty & underwhelming. The hibachi grill is fun & entertaining. You sit around a large cooktop, often with other patrons, and the chef comes out to cook your menu selection for you. They play up the showmanship. The food isn't great though. I found it overcooked & salty."}
{"text":"Just ok, but then i am from new orleans. This may be peak experience for the cornfields... beef satay was tough as shoe leather, rolls (maki) were small, tasted fresh but uninspired...place was packed by 730 pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I am able to get quality sushi here slightly cheaper than the other quality sushi serving places.  It's not trying to be exclusively authentic Japanese, it's great if you want to eat at a fusion-Asian place and have your pineapple fried rice, sushi and spring roll all at the same time.  My fav items here are: house salad (good dressing), spider roll, sake-tini (they use cucumber vodka, AWESOME!), lao san roll, and Thai lettuce wraps.  For some reason I didn't like the rolls that included spicy tuna or spicy salmon rolls - it seemed more liked canned tuna/canned salmon.   The staff has ALWAYS been great with our baby - It looks to be a fancy place that is too high class for families but that is not true, and I will always feel welcome with the whole family."}
{"text":"Went to Oishi with my family who are residents of Champaign.  It's a place they love going to because with 5 kids under the age of 14, and 5 adults, they like going to places that will have something to make everyone happy.  Also, my nieces and nephews have been eating sashimi and maki since they were 5 and have developed quite a sophisticated palate ;).  Because, it's Champaign, this is place they come often to get their sushi fix :).  And Oishi does deliver on that account.  They have a habachi, hot entrees and quite the selection of sushi, sashimi, and maki making it a place for the sushi and non-sushi eater alike.    Our party of 9 started with the shrimp shumai (very good), crab rangoon (more cream cheese and barely any \"crab\", but what can you expect for $4??).  My nephew had the Grilled Sesame Crusted Tuna: Served rare with peanut sauce marinated soba noodle with spicy mayo & wasabi sauce.  I had a bite and it was quite tasty!  My husband ordered the pineapple fried rice.  It was sooooooooooo bland and boring.  No flavor and the rice was overcooked.  Big miss.  For our rolls, we ordered: 1. Spicy Tuna - This was nicely executed simple but classic roll.  I could detect a hint of spice which made me happy.   2.  Ocean Fourteen: Rock shrimp tempura, avocado topped with crunchy spicy snow crab.  Really enjoyed this roll!  The rock shrimp and spicy snow crab were a marriage in heaven!   3.  Pink Lady Lobster:  Lobster tempura, avocado, cucumber, tobiko wrapped in pink soy paper with spicy lobster sauce.  Also, very good!  I liked the fact that they weren't stingy with the lobster :).  4.  Red Hot Dragon: Shrimp tempura roll topped with spicy tuna & crunch.  Good but nothing memorable.    5.  Toro Dynasty: Crunchy spicy tuna, avocado topped with tuna toro, salmon toro & yellowtail toro.  This was also good, but nothing memorable.    6.  Golden Dragon: Spicy yellowtail, tuna, cucumber topped with fresh mango & honey wasabi sauce.  The fresh mango was a delicious touch and the honey wasabi sauce was a new flavor profile for me and I really enjoyed it!   We wrapped up dinner with dessert.  They have a pretty big selection of miniature sized desserts for $4.  They're just big enough to satisfy a post meal sweet tooth without pushing you to the edge.  We got the chocolate fudge cake, which was warm and fluffy and the perfect sweet treat to end a nice meal with the fam.  Our server was a little odd and abrupt, but we realized it just might be her personal demeanor and nothing we needed to take personally.  If this big, bad city gal wouldn't mind returning to Oishi, then why would anyone else?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! And of course watching our chef cook and toss shrimp onto people's plates was fun. Very clean restaurant with fast friendly service and the prices weren't crazy. Go hungry though cause you get lots of food, plenty to take home. Nice atmosphere for families as well as a date night."}
{"text":"I went to Oishi for lunch twice.  One of my friends said she did not like it, but I wanted to see for myself.   On the first visit I had a salad with grilled salmon on top and a spicy salmon roll.  It was a lunch special.  I found the roll to be delicious and the salmon salad was very memorable (I think it was the dressing).  My husband had some sushi and a side salad.  Something about his salad was off.  I don't know if it was the dressing or the greens but it was very bitter.  On my second visit I made my own soup.  I opted for a coconut curry soup with udon noodles.  The soup was flavorful and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.    I would certainly go back, and I would even consider going there for dinner.  I will avoid the salad, however."}
{"text":"I love coming here for hibachi. Similar to what you'd find in other cities, but they seem to do everything right. The chefs are engaging, the food is cooked with a perfect proportion of teriyaki sauce, and the yum yum and ginger sauces in the table are addicting. I'm personally a sucker for the ginger. You'll also get some extra shrimp no matter what you order. They made birthdays extra enjoyable as well as they make you wear a hat, give you dessert, and post your picture on the wall (I know from experience).  I usually alternate between hibachi chicken, filet, scallops, and salmon when I come here. The shrimp as awesome but like I said, you get a couple pieces anyway."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is good. The service is good. I just go for the hibachi!!!"}
{"text":"Best Hibachi in town in my opinion ! Just wished that gave me more rice! I loved their clear soup, it's always perfect! I don't know why it has a lower review , although it's far from campus it is very affordable and worth it!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good but the service from the start to the bar all the way to the table were a bit off putting. I was with a group of people and it took 10 to 15 minutes for the bartender to wait on me and that is only after everyone else had ordered a drink and I had to tell him I wanted to order something."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! It was not at all worth what we had to go through to eat there as a family. I have never seen such a poor excuse for management anywhere, she was RUDE and did not even try to explain things, she had no consistency in explanations and actually tried blaming her waitress for their problem.   My family decided to meet here to have dinner one night. Unfortunately we found out how much they do not care for their customers.   My mother in law purchased gift certificates for this place on-line and gave them to my wife and all her siblings as a Christmas present. We were all going to use these that night, not on one bill but we were all paying separate bills and were trying to use them individually. This apparently isn't allowed if you sit at the same table, but the manager said it would be OK if we sat at different tables. The manager then tried to tell us the only reason we couldn't use them was because the gift certificates have the same name on them, we explained that when you purchase them you cannot choose what name you put on them, its the name of who purchased them. To try to prove her point she whips out her iphone to show us a laundry service add from where my mother in law purchased the gift certificates. We explained that was completely different than a gift certificate to this place, then the manager actually stated \"your waitress didn't have the guts to explain this when you wanted to pay\", actually the waitress said it should be fine because we were paying separately. At that point the manager tried to make us feel bad because when we use the coupons  they loose money.... The only response to that was: So stop selling them!!! She even had some guy from the kitchen stalking our table while she attempted to make sense to us. The manager then said it would be OK to use the coupons, ran our bill, then decided against her first decision and re-ran our bill after voiding out the coupon.   I will absolutely never darken their door again. I hope they lose all of their customers by running them off. Take my advice, don't buy a coupon to their place, if you do you may have to waste 45 minutes of your life dealing with the sorry excuse of a manager that was working. The worst part of it all was that they could have told us about this before we gave them our credit cards and we would have just paid."}
{"text":"We've been here several times always a great meal. But last night was the Best ever, my wife's Birthday, we had 11 guests. The food and entertainment were the BEST! We will definitely be back for more great food,"}
{"text":"I liked it! No complaints and I will be back. The service was very good and I enjoyed the chef who cooked at our table!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The prices are a lot less expensive than any other Japanese restaurant I've been to, maybe because of the location (Champaign). I ordered the filet mignon with scallops and a few sushi rolls. The seafood that I had was NOT fresh. The scallops were mushy and had a funky taste, and the meat in the sushi did not taste good at all. If I'm forced to go again, I will just stick to the steak, which was actually pretty good. But I will not go there again."}
{"text":"I've had better. It's not awful, but sad that this is the only hibachi around. Wish there was a Myabi!! One time I ordered it for pickup and I don't eat the white sauce or ginger sauce, I put teriyaki on everything! They wanted $1 per little side of teriyaki! But if you eat there, it's free. They also don't give you salt or pepper when ordering to go. Make better tasting food, and I wouldn't have to salt and pepper it. I will say they were nice, and let me open my dish and salt and pepper at a vacant table."}
{"text":"We went here on our last day of our weekend visit to Champaign-Urbana and we really liked it. I love these Benihana style Japanese restaurants. Our chef was really cool. Very engaging and had a lot of fun with all of us at the table. One thing I have to say is here in Indiana, at Kumo in Greenwood, the food quality is a little better, but at Oishi, quantity is much more. I ordered the steak and chicken with a side of noodle and my wife ordered steak and scallop. Both of us were blown away by the amount of rice, veg and meat we all got. I think it was well worth the money, which is about $22/person, give or take. I have a mushroom allergy and they were awesome in catering to that minor annoyance.  Overall, I'd say it's a good place for a family to enjoy."}
{"text":"Personally, one of my favoriate place to go in Champaign.  This place is more of a Asian Fusion than traditional Japanese or traditional Asian.  I usually go out for their lunch special. A three course meal (soup/salad/meal) for $6.95. All three soups they offer there taste good and their food is really good. I personnally enjoy their Sambal Shrimp.  The appetizers taste really good. Personal favorite is the calamari. I like the ones from here the most.  The salad can create some issues. I do admit. the ginger dressing is too ginery for my taste and the salad itself is not too consistent quality wise."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food, (I ordered soup and sushi) lovely interior (well lit, clean, classy) and friendly wait staff who were happy to answer my dozens of questions as a first time visitor. I will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Love their ginger dressing for the salad (try it! don't default to ranch or an american alternative...). The sushi is delicious, perfectly prepared. Their presentation is beautiful, and love the china.   The only reason I knock off one star is because I feel their wait staff is clueless about how to serve customers. I haven't had a good server experience yet, really hope they step up their expectations of their wait staff."}
{"text":"I have had pad thai here. The food is OK, definitely not great. Asked for a spicy one; got served a bland one. The noodles was greasy as well. No idea about the sushi or the hibachi. Overall, the yum factor is missing. Somehow the restaurant has maintained an upscale vibe. But not impressed enough to recommend this one."}
{"text":"I was really craving sushi so I decided to head to Oishi on a whim on a Thursday night. I was definitely disappointed.  I ordered the Pan-Pan noodles with chicken, a Philadelphia roll, and a Spicy Salmon Roll. The noodles did not taste crispy at all even though they looked crispy. They were chewy and the sauce that gather around the bottom made the noodles very soft and chewy. I had a hard time biting the noodles. An upside of this dish was that the chicken was cooked nicely and there were tons of veggies. The Philadelphia Roll was okay. I ultimately just tasted the cream cheese, which is okay for me because I like cream cheese. For the Spicy Salmon Roll, I was very disappointed. It definitely looked like a Spicy Salmon Roll, but when I bit into it, it was completely bland. I did not even taste the spiciness. All I got was a tasteless sauce with warm fish.   A few good things: -The food was visually pleasing. -The service was good. The waitress refilled my drink consistently and didn't make me wait around for the check. -It wasn't busy when I walked in, but I don't understand why the food didn't taste better if there wasn't a back-up in the kitchen.  All I can say is that I'm hoping this was just a off night for the kitchen and that the food gets better. I was very disappointed in the sushi. So I don't think I would be back especially when I know there are other options for sushi in the Champaign-Urbana area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I went to Oishi a couple of weeks ago for the first time with a friend. I got a half off coupon from some website, so I didn't really expect it to be that great. I guess my philosophy is that if a restaurant has to consistently resort to selling half price gift certificates, then they probably aren't that good to begin with.   The menu was a mixture of Asian cuisines. I expected a more Japanese menu, but I thought the menu was just all over the place (which is not a good sign in a restaurant). I got some chicken katsu-like dish which turned out to be pretty good. Huge portion, great presentation, and a bargain with my half price certificate. My friend got some mango vegetable dish, and it was good, but not great.   One gripe though. Our waitress was just rude and plain bad. Probably one of the worst waitresses I've come across. She spoke poor english and looked like she's pissed off all the time. For a restaurant that puts such a heavy emphasis on presentation, they should probably hire a real professional waitress/waiter instead of hiring probably a family friend or something who just immigrated here.   Pros: good enough food. very cheap with coupons (which can be easily found online). very beautiful presentation.  Cons: rude waitress."}
{"text":"I decided to try Oishi for lunch.  When I saw that this restaurant was located on north Prospect, I expected it to be similar to other family-style restaurants in that part of town.  Instead, I found Oishi to be quite sophisticated; a restaurant that probably would have fit in comfortably with the nightlife of downtown Champaign.  The interior is furnished with black leather, glass artwork (of scandalously bare-chested geisha...?), and flat-screen TVs.  There was club music pumping in the background throughout my meal (kind of annoying/inappropriate for lunch?).  As a fair warning for those \"foodie purists\" out there, this is not a traditional Japanese establishment, but an Asian fusion restaurant, much like KoFusion.  There are options for \"exotic\" fare (e.g., sushi, Thai red snapper) and also more familiar, conservative options (e.g., fried rice, General Tso's chicken).   Unfortunately, I've only sampled the sushi here, so I can't comment on the quality of the stir-fry items.  My impression is that they take popular Asian dishes and \"elevate\" them with a few fancy techniques.  The presentation of dishes is quite impressive.  On my sushi plate, there was a small floral arrangement and an artistic drizzle of sauces (including some kind of Asian \"barbecue\" sauce and spicy mayonnaise).  The rolled sushi was compact, neat, and divided into manageable sizes.  The sashimi was cut beautifully, showcasing the color and texture of the fish.  I had no problem with the freshness of the fish, either.  As part of the lunch combination, you're offered a salad and a choice of different soups (miso, wonton, and hot & sour soup).  The salad was standard (iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, etc.), but the ginger dressing deviated in an interesting way from the usual recipe (I think I detected a hint of grapefruit or other citrus...?).  The soups, while dished out in generous portions, were forgettable and bland.  Overall, I found the experience to be lovely and enjoyable.  The service was professional and the food was quite good, especially in terms of presentation.  I'm sure I'll be back to dine here again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious meals. Entertaining chef. Great prices for lunch. We are coming back often!"}
{"text":"This place is redolent of Elephant Bar: a sit down that's a bit higher scale than other chains, but the food is mediocre. I suppose this would be one of those places where you'd take a business client out to lunch or dinner. I had their sushi and it was definitely below average. I gave their veal a taste and my taste buds didn't find it so agreeable. The extra money you're paying for here is for the milieu, not the quality of food."}
{"text":"For those who did not know, Oishi just reopened with hibachi grill areas. We have tried to take the kids to another local hibachi grill numerous times, but that place had restrictive hours and poor service.  For those in our area who have had similar experiences, Oishi is your new answer. Hostess staff was friendly. Server was attentive. Hibachi chef was wonderful, and the food was great.  We liked the decor and the food before, and have put this on our permanent list because of our experience tonight. Thanks Oishi and to everyone reading, go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I don't think the chef of this place had ever been to a real Japanese restaurant, otherwise, it would be very hard to explain why you could actually taste the vinegar in the vinegar seasoned rice. Even you are a sea food lover, I suggest you stay away from the sea food lover curry.   Nothing we had there could be considered Japanese food. Even if you ignore the \"Japanese\" part, it is just so-so.   If you want to have Japanese styled grill, go to the chicken teriyaki place in the mall. If you want to have bento, go to Yellow Fin. Those are better choices in town for food itself. But, of course, the decor in this place is much better than the mall."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3 times now. THe first time they were busy and the wait time was real long. They compensated me with 10% off. I was fine with it.   I order sushi or sahimi here every time. The sashimi tastes fresh, they are cut large and the price is fair.   I have yet to try the hibachi but everyone seems to be having a good time.   I recommend this place"}
{"text":"We had 2 California Rolls presented beautifully and shared the General Tao's Chicken...everything was fresh and delicious! Very prompt server too!"}
{"text":"I'm lowering my previous review because when I've gone back lately it's been consistently meh.  My husband and I used to enjoy ordering food at the bar but that's not allowed anymore.  Service lacks at time and have experienced our table being forgotten about.    Also, I know for families it's loud and nice in that way but as a childfree person it's cheeky and just not suitable for what I want in a dining experience."}
{"text":"So I've been here for both hibachi and sushi. imho, hibachi is never really worth it and Oishi's no different. If you like the theatrics of it and standard food, then sure go for it.  The time I've been here for sushi, though, that was a game changer. The fish I've had here are SO fresh, and the flavors are pretty spot on. I didn't think this would be a good place for sushi, but I happily stand corrected. The jimmy sexy roll and spicy crunch scallop are SO flavorful and tender that my boyfriend wanted to get seconds. The soups (miso and curry) are pretty big, but you do pay like $2-$3 for them."}
{"text":"Overall just okay.  We received great service but the food lacked any depth of flavor.  They really don't do any spicy options and the hot sauce provided wasn't hot.  The California roll was tasteless.  We had non-traditional sushi eaters and went with Pink Lady lobster roll and Jimmy's Sexy Roll (name a bit disconcerting) and these were the best things we ordered.  Chicken Udon was bland-one note flavor.  Beef Pad Thai had too much fish sauce and tasted off - like salty metal.  Better options for sushi (Kofusion nigiri plate is awesome and Sakanaya).  Better Asian options (Kofusion again and Pho 911 on campus never disappoints but zero ambiance).  I'd probably go somewhere else rather than back to Oishi."}
{"text":"I love Oshi! Every time go there it is awesome...A little pricey but great food....fresh sushi and I love the coca nut curry soup.."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi lunch. Lunch specials are AMAZING! food is pretty good. they recently started having a habachi table too haven't tried the habachi but I probably will next time. Their pinapple fried rice is really good as well!"}
{"text":"Great steak, nice bartenders and sushi chefs but average service at the cooking tables.  I would go back."}
{"text":"It used to be my go to spot for lunch but now the customer service is horrible and the food is mediocre. I have waited at the entrance for over 10 minutes before a host attempted to seat us mind you no one was in front of us or anything. The employees had a loud argument just inches away from my table, which is very unprofessional. I would of recommended this place last year but not now. It is a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I was a little concern by the other reviews. It appears that management should look into customer service because those reviews are pretty bad. We can in for lunch and had the Sushi and sashimi for 2 which had 8 pieces of sushi, 14 pieces of sashimi, and one roll of the crunchy spicy salmon, eel avocado, and toro dynasty roll. The pieces of sashimi are smaller than Sakanaya, but more of them. The rolls again were a few pieces. For 45 dollars this is cheaper than Sakanaya. The fish appeared fresh and was tasty served on a decorative platter with ice and lights. Overall I was happy with the meal and it was enough food for 2 people, but I can see why people may have issues with customer service here.  There are also a variety of lunch specials with hibachi which are only 10 dollar. We did not end up trying those items, but it seems like a good deal.  Pros: sushi for 2 option, hibachi lunch specials, fresh fish  Cons: customer service appears to be a low priority here  Hidden deals: Lots of inexpensive lunch specials for around 10 dollars for hibachi. Noodles are extra."}
{"text":"I miss the buffet!  I went here with my boyfriend really wanting the buffet that I had here forever ago and I was so sad to walk in and see that it was gone! They replaced it with a bunch of teppan tables, which yeah, that's cool and all but 1. I didn't want to eat there because we were kind of under a time crunch and 2. I didn't want to smell like fryer food (except for I did anyway, boo). 3. If I wanted good teppanyaki I'd go to Kamakura.  After I got over my initial disappointment, I ordered some curry. The seafood in it was good, but there was seriously ZERO curry sauce in it. My bowl of white rice that came with it served no purpose due to the lack of sauce, it was a bummer.  I will say though that my boyfriends sushi was really good. I totally should've ordered that. But in all honesty, if I wanted sushi, I would've just gone to Ko Fusion, Kamakura, or Sushi Kame."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The only place I've ate a salad with the spoon, it was more like a lettuce soup (ginger dressing). My mom ordered Pad Thai. I almost told her don't order Thai at a Japanese restaurant but I didn't. It was like a lean cuisine. The quality of the chicken was about the same as a hot pocket. Slimy, gross. I think I've had precooked Tyson chicken that wasn't as gross. The noodles were just straight up boiled and not even fried. Overall, un-edible. I got sushi and it was sloppy and not so fresh. I hate to be a negative nancy but do your self a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good.  The food is tasty and it's not as expensive as some sushi places I've been too.  Today I had Edamame and Indian Pancake with curry dripping (did they mean dipping?) sauce for appetizers to share.  The amount of Edamame was LOTS with just the right amount of salt.  It was the first time I'd ever had Indian Pancake and I thought it was QUITE good.  For my meal, I ordered a Salmon, Jalapeno, Avocado roll and it was excellent.  This is one of the few places I've been where they have Jalapeno offered to put on rolls and I love how it spices them up.  All in all, a very good lunch."}
{"text":"Enjoyable hibachi experience. Pretty standard from what I've seen in other cities, but always a great time. The chef at the table was funny, made some good jokes, and also cooked the food really well, while keeping us engaged.  I had the filet and chicken combination, and they always give everyone a few shrimps as well. Starts off with salad and soup, and the ginger dressing on the salad was really good. Soup was beef broth with mushrooms, also really good.  Yum yum sauce and ginger sauce were a plus and I enjoyed dipping the meat and veggies in there."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the waitress that works there. She was excellent, but the poor interior (a poor imitation of KO fusion's vibe) and horrid food quality ties Oishi to one star. I resisted the urge to puke while chewing stale, old fish meat.   Also, the price for hibachi doubles from lunch to dinner, though there seems to be no evident difference in the amount you get. Talk about unreasonable!"}
{"text":"Nice presentation, nice interior, but the food is a bit underwhelming and expensive. If you're just looking for a nice place to sit around for a bit and chat this would be great. But if you're expecting the food to taste as good as it looks you might be a little disappointed."}
