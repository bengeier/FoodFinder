{"text":"HORRIBLE !!!!!! Just ordered 44$ worth of food for delivery and  threw it all away after one bite . First they gave me the wrong order and second the quality of the food was disgusting. This place should be banned from making Chinese food yet any kind of food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Tuesday and the place was pretty empty. Still waited a bit before someone came to our table though. The food was fresh and great though, so it was ok. The ginger beef of course was great. I would recommend this place, although it as quite pricey."}
{"text":"Service is under par compared to other Chinese cuisine restaurants. The food seems ok, but it's not just about the food, is it?"}
{"text":"Pretty good...try the shrimp appetizer with the sesame seeds ontop...mmm so good!!!"}
{"text":"Just to start: I've only ever been here for the buffet, and not the actual Dim Sum.   So the buffet: it's pretty ok. It's like any other buffet you would go to, but it doesn't have as large a selection as some other places. I'm also a pretty big sweets person and will always leave space for dessert but this places only option are Jell-o and caramelized pineapples. The quality of the food is just as good as any other Asian buffet place, but I think the price is lower. My biggest issue is that the last two times we went our seats were in the buffet area and therefore we were quite neglected for water and I get pretty thirsty when I eat so it was an unpleasant and dry experience. It's reasonable, but it's not the best Asian Buffet place. The Dim Sum does look like it would be quite good though!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad for take out Chinese. The sweet and sour pork was OK. The beef in the beef and broccoli was too thick. The spring roll was gross - deep fried with some sort of dough like a corn dog but without any flavour. The deep fried shrimp had the same gross dough.   The Bistro is way better - but don't let anyone know ok?"}
{"text":"Shadow of its former self. This used to be a great neighbourhood restaurant in the heart of Brentwood. Used to love ordering from here. They moved locations a few hundred feet and left he heart of the old place there.  Sloppily put together dishes, catering to the mall customers. This is the last time I will be coming here."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Small portion of Chicken with vegetables.  No real sauce,  just a broth with no flavor.  Had to add a ton of soy sauce.  Chicken was undercooked.  No rice included with order.  You had to pay $2.00 extra for that.  I've never heard of that   before.  Chinese food where no rice is included?!!!  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Ginger beef is good every few years, and nothing is better than this place. I grew up eating this stuff, and when I am in town its good to have a taste."}
{"text":"Food was good (had the ginger beef and lemon chicken. Not the best I've had, but also nowhere near the worst either."}
{"text":"Has been go to delivery place until now.   Yesterday we ordered 5 dishes, were billed for 5 dishes, receipt showed 5 dishes and 4 were delivered.  Sloppy execution resulting in paying for food not delivered.    The food is consistently good, which is why we have ordered here for years.  That said, will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Okay I was born and raised here In Calgary as well my fellow reviewer's. I have been coming to this establishment on and off for years. Last night, my wife, two kids and I decided to eat here for dinner. I haven't been here for about a year or so.(My regular is Bonavista Peking house). It was very busy, but were seated right away.   The waiter took our drink order, water for everyone and two diet Cokes. 10 minutes later no diet cokes. At this time my three year old was getting a little hard to keep occupied, since he was getting hungry. Oh yeah forgot to mention the water did come right away. We also ordered our food when the water came. Chicken fried rice, salt & pepper seafood, and beef with green onion and ginger in a pot. 25 minutes later the food is still no where in sight. 30 minutes go by, and I finally ask the waiter what is taking so long. He says it is very busy and everyone is waiting, not just our table. No offer of apology nothing. That's what I can't stand about that chinese restaurant. If it were an Earl's or Moxie's, they would buy you an appetizer for your inconvenience or knock at least 10% off your bill. Their is no customer service whatsoever. I don't think they care if you ever come back. To top it off, my son had a pair of chopsticks on his lap when we asked for the cheque. The waiter asked if he was going to keep the chopsticks, as if he were going to \"add\" them to the bill. My wife and I were very insulted, accusing our son of stealing thier chopsticks. To conclude my review the cheque came to  $44.11 and we left $45.00. If we had exact change we would`ve left exactly the amount on the bill. The service and the experince was HORRIBLE.   WE WILL NEVER GO BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What the hell did I just eat? Satay beef skewers were dripping in oil, deep fried and flavourless! The satay sauce was soo salty/msg'y, then chicken and cashew nuts was s'more like celery with chicken an cashews. The sauce tasted too rich, like it was concentrate. Had to leave 3/4 of it and feeling sort of dizzy from whatever food additives was in it?!?! The only thing going for it was the service!"}
{"text":"Students: Great price, delivers, and gives you so much food that you'll have leftovers for tomorrow with their great meal deals. With that being said, it's an average Chinese restaurant with nothing standing out. If you are looking for a place with huge portions, and a bang for your buck, give it a try."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, but decent portion sizes.  Wonton soup tastes like water.  Couldn't find their menu on their website, so called to ask if the prices and items on the Zomato website were the correct ones, and if not, where I could find their correct/newest menu online.  The staff on the phone was rude and responded with a condescending tone, asking me if I've ever used the Internet before.  Was surprised by their lack of willingness to help and their poor customer service.  Won't go back to them for this reason."}
{"text":"Holy, I wish I lived closer to this restaurant - wait, maybe not as I would be broke! In another plaza we had not yet explored before sits Ginger Beef on Macleod. A group of friends had asked us to join them here so we made the drive from downtown. It was very clean and out friends had secured a table no problem. It smelled SO good in there. This place has a lot of tables, many of them larger so groups like ours could enjoy family style dishes. Now, people that know me know I like me OWN plate and do not eat family style, well, really ever! But I was a team player on this night and picked out a dish as I was instructed to. 7 of us = 7 dishes and there a handy turnwheel on the table that made everything simple! The service was impeccable. The waiter caught my attention with his cute Snoopy tie on and was a really GOOD waiter. The kind that brings everyone water when one or 2 ask for it... and steps away when you are later paying by credit card as you insert your pin #. He never missed a drink nor dish and I felt like for $20 each, we got our money's worth and more. The dishes included salt and pepper squid, chicken fried rice, salt and pepper chicken, curried beef, a noodle dish, garlic spare ribs (my selection) 2 orders of dumplings... wow, I could be forgetting something...  my mouth is watering and I want to go back!  One friend at our table said that he goes here for lunch all the time and has never had a bad experience. The packed dining room we noted on our way out shows this place is doing something right at a fair price. 5 stars! Yay!"}
{"text":"no longer in business, for lease signs in windows. (willow park location anyway)"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. Shame on you for going from one of the best Chinese food options to the absolute worst. When you moved into the Brentwood mall a few years ago, that's when things fell apart. We thought we'd give you one last try the other day, and I swear, NEVER again. Everything was cold and not enough sauce on anything. Meat was not chewable, and prices were way out of whack for the portions that arrived. I could go on and on, but I'll be nice and will shut up now."}
{"text":"A very convenient Dim Sum location in South Calgary. Great location for anyone going for after mass lunch with their family. Counterproductive since this place has such a great Dim Sum menu that you can't resist but commit gluttony.   Also check out their freezer section for frozen Dim Sum items like dumplings, pork buns, and shomai. I bought a few packages of Dim Sum and when I later steamed them, they were amazing. Also in this section is a chili oil sauce that they sell that is amazing"}
{"text":"Average Dim sum, 4 dishes $20 is a pretty high for average food  Suggest the trip to a Dim Sum Restaurant on centre st downtown is worth the trip and give this one a pass"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location and was initially told the food would take about an hour. It came almost 20 minutes earlier which was great! We had 5 guys eating and ended up with more than enough food and the bill only came out to $63! The delivery guy was so kind too, recommending that we check out the website next time for coupons so we could get additional savings. The food was very good... Nothing too extravagant, but the service, quality and affordability has definitely made me a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Not one of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to. I found most dishes lacked flavor or was really greasy. My favorite dish, the sweet pork chops, were bland and so was the other pork chop (salty).  The only dish I would highly recommend was the Peking duck. The slices of duck were amazingly meaty, compared to others places which give you mostly fat. The fried prawns were great as well. Not sure why the carpet felt really sticky when walking on it as well add the tiled floors, almost like there was a sheet of grease on it. Despite this, it was fairly clean."}
{"text":"Wow!.  What a different a year makes.  When these guys relocated from the old spot to the new spot next to Safeway, we think they keep the same quality of food that garnered 15 years of returning customers.  NOT....  had ordered a simple house chow mein and Singapore spicy rice  noodle....and guest what....... WORST Chinese food ever in my life.    Worst than going to a small town and finding \"Peking restaurant\" with sweet and sour pork  for the small town sorry $sses.     Having tasted Chinese food from all over Canada and the US, even Spanish cooks in south  LA can do a better job than the Cantonese/mandarin factory worker turn cook.  The chubby girl with glasses was one rude beeoch!  She was like that a year ago  .She probably say to herself....another sucker for today.  I would not go there....... never over my dead body..... even fried chicken dry white meat rates better than their amateur \"wokers\" slap-on's.     The management  (Chain Corporate - Pizza 73 wannaby) certainly made a mistake compromising on this sorry $ss take-out venture instead of waiting for a full service restaurant spot to continue their neighborhood fame.  This has to be a colossal error on their brand name and rePuk-tation. Adios."}
{"text":"I only gave it one star because I have too. My boyfriend and I are the least fussy people I know, especially my bf but this place was absolutely horrible. Couldn't even finish my food, no flavour, greasy, over all just awful shit. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"I had been craving some tasty Peking Duck for a while now, and when I saw Ginger Beef Peking House, I mentally bookmarked this as the restaurant where I would have dinner.   The  new Ginger Beef is a lot better than the old one, as this Asian restaurant is actually owned by Asians, unlike the previous one. A cool feature in here is that they have a giant glass window that stretches from floor to ceiling, dividing the main dining area from the kitchen. This allows the customers to see the chefs skillfully preparing their noodles and dumplings, which presents a degree of transparency about the freshness of the food!!  The noodles were a mouthful. Nothing special here, though. The cold noodles were actually a bit unpleasant to eat.. they were pretty bland. The Xiao Long Bao did not have a soup filling, which was disappointing. I like to have soup inside of my juicy Xiao Long Bao's.  I also ordered a Spicy Peanut Noodle, which was delicious. The balance of sweet and spicy created a tasty dish that left me fighting with others at the table to drink the broth. I would definitely recommend ordering this dish.  And finally, for the elephant in the room: the Peking duck. The plate of duck came with a decent amount of roasted meat and crunchy skin. The Peking duck was very flavorful, and like the Spicy Peanut Noodles, I ended up fighting to get the last piece of meat. However, the Peking duck wrap was a hard piece of tortilla, which was the second disappointment of the night. When I tried to roll the tortilla around the meat and sauce, it cracked in my hands. This actually made it pretty difficult to eat the Peking duck without getting my hands covered in the sweet sauce.  The service was decent. The waiters were quick, and our food came out on time. But then again, Ginger Beef Peking House is a new restaurant, and the management is still trying to make a good impression on its customers.  The total cost of our dinner was pretty pricey, and although the food was delicious, I would not recommend coming to Ginger Beef Peking house unless you have some money to blow and don't mind eating hard, stale Peking duck tortillas rolls."}
{"text":"My family was craving Peking duck so we made reservations for 10 people at this establishment. We sat down and noticed the restaurant was"}
{"text":"I've dined here since, oh, 1986, and I've seen the restaurant expand from its original narrow room to its more spacious interior today. The weekend lunch buffet is good value, especially since they serve lightly-battered salt and pepper shrimp, unlike many other Chinese buffet places that skimp on seafood altogether."}
{"text":"Wow!! My husband and I stayed at Calgary and were looking good Asian food. We thought we won't find any good Cantonese food in Alberta since Vancouver BC have sooo many good Asian restaurants( that's where we are from)  We appreciate they accommodate my husband's gluten and dairy free diet( no soy sauce and oyster sauce )  The food tastes great !! Will suggest friends to come too!"}
{"text":"Being a born and raised Calgarian (southie to boot) means I know something about Chinese buffet. Thankfully Ginger Beef Peking House has been a staple here since I was a kid. The lunch buffet is easily top 5 in the city with a decent selection, and as you've read in other reviews, home of the best ginger beef in the city. Conveniently located just off MacLeod Tr, if you're hankering for decent Chinese don't hesitate to make a visit."}
{"text":"If you're wanting an authentic Chinese meal and live in the South end of Calgary, you know as much as me that there are not too many restaurants that deliver on authenticity. This place does and it's tasty, paired with a nice atmosphere, & good service.  At first glance you may think that it's 'westernized' Chinese food due to the lack of local flavor in the joint (besides the staff) but you'd be wrong!  Of course they do serve the ginger beef, and sweet 'n sour pork that everyone is familiar with... but they also have a Chinese menu!  This doesn't help the customers who don't read or speak Chinese but it does exist and you can order 'real' Chinese dishes as you would at any restaurant in Chinatown or the NW.   We usually come here for their Peking duck, and add on additional courses as needed.  The Peking duck meal is ordered as a 3 course meal - 1st course is a soup made from the duck bones.  The 2nd course is a make-it-yourself wrap featuring the crispy duck skin and meat slices, flour tortillas, cucumbers, onions, and hoisin sauce. The 3rd and last dish is a 'hand-pulled' noodle dish made with the rest of the duck meat.  If you've never had Peking duck, it's worth a try on your next visit!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy dumpling and Peking duck!!! good Chinese food in South Calgary.. Price is very fair!!! Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Review #14 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I've been told by a friend that the duck in Ginger Beef is one the best in Calgary so my husband and I went. When we got there, there were about 10 groups ahead of us and we were told to come back after 30 minutes. We were expecting to wait so that didn't disappoint. Instead of waiting in their small waiting area (they should probably do something about this especially now that it's cold and waiting outside is not an option) we went to Homesense to buy some stuff. We were back at Ginger Beef in less than 30 minutes and we were surprised that our table was ready. That made my tummy very happy. We were seated right away and was welcomed by a very cheerful server who immediately served us water. We were so hungry so instead of getting the duck (which isn't a lot for it's price) we opted for regular ala carte menu to get more food. I like how tasty and how balanced the flavors of their dishes are - from the soup, the rice to the entree items. I didn't mind that the dishes were a little too oily but I hope they do something about this as it made my mouth feel weird after eating. The flavors definitely reminded me of good Chinese restaurants in the Philippines so I will definitely be back! And yes I will be back for the duck!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Chinese place. The food is good quality and fresh; the menu has both standard and more 'traditional' Chinese items; and the service is fast. All-in-all, the experience was quite nice if altogether unremarkable.   My husband and I ate here a few weeks ago, and I'm sad I didn't write my review sooner because I can't remember all we had. I know we ordered some dumplings an a tofu dish but beyond that I'm drawing a blank. I think that should let you know how unremarkable I was. Don't get me wrong, we walked away from that meal satiated and quite content, but now a few weeks later, I cannot bring up the details to save my life. (Ok, I'm sure if it was to save my life, I would try a bit harder to remember.)  Anyway, moral of my story is that this is a good place for a lunch/dinner in the area but don't expect to have a meal of a lifetime."}
{"text":"You know that place where families want to get together once a year to have a family reunion, Ginger Beef House is that place for a variety of Chinese cuisine.  Apparently, this is the place my dad's favorite dish is, or what he grew up liking. A quant and family oriented place, Ginger Beef House has some good dishes for a Chinese experience, but is grounded to look like the restaurant it is. At least it's clean in there and has OK service.   We got a variety of dishes, and it basically blends with your experience. The gathering of families talking about their lives, you talking about your own trying to impress them that you're not living under a rock. The foods tastes about the same.   Think about the Chinese food you've had, this place is the same. There's mushu duck which comes with cucumbers and onions and hoisin sauce, pretty common, but pretty delicious with a great combination with the Peking duck. There's lobster if you want to feel fancy, but way over priced for that kind of restaurant. The main show was the ginger beef, which is really a better version of orange chicken as it has that same crispy consistency, but a better sauce of course. A sweet and tangy sauce made up of soy sauce, ginger, garlic and chili sauce makes the dish savory and sweet great to munch on with some plain rice or not so special fried rice. Throw in some random vegetable dish such as bok choy or garlic green beans and your set for a traditional Chinese meal with your family."}
{"text":"Just based on the name of this restaurant you know what to order.  If you're new to Calgary this is the place to get ginger beef.  They invented it!!  What do you mean you don't know what ginger beef is?  Blasphemy!! Get your ass over here right now and become educated about the greatness of ginger beef."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy, do I love a good Chinese restaurant.  Whether I'm craving it for breakfast or after a late night of partying, Chinese food always hits the spot.  And Ginger Beef Peking House helps to fill that craving.  One of the main reasons I love this place is because of how quick they are with your food.  If you're picking up, your order will be ready in less than 20 minutes.  If you're waiting for delivery, you won't be waiting any longer than 40.  Plus, delivery is free within a restricted area.  The food is quite delicious too.  I was surprised by their yummy, yummy ginger beef.  I guess since it's in their name it should be good, but this stuff was fan-freakin-tastic.  It wasn't too gingery and overpowering, but it had a nice amount of sauce to it.  So tasty!  All their other menu items are pretty delicious too.  I enjoy the lemon chicken, wor won ton soup, chicken chow mein, and many, many others.  The prices aren't ridiculous either.  It's pretty typical of a Chinese place, I suppose.  They've got their meal combos which are probably the best deals, plus they've got an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet for only $9.  Now, try to tell me that isn't a sweet deal!  This is definitely one of the great Chinese take-out and delivery places in the NW.  And, since it's pretty close to me, I like to indulge in the occasional meal for two for just myself!"}
{"text":"Food arrived soggy and cold, salt n pepper squid and spring rolls weren't edible, tasted like mush, won't ever order food from this location again, spent $80 on take-out, very disappointing, an hour later and I still can't get the awful taste out of my mouth, just gross."}
{"text":"We order delivery once a month from Ginger Beef we find the quality and delivery time to be exceptional. We enjoy a variety things from the menu including ginger beef, won ton soup, and sweet and sour dishes. We recommend this place if you want to enjoy your house but have a great meal brought in!"}
