{"text":"This small restaurant is located in the heart of Chinatown, Toronto. Despite being in a sea of other Chinese restaurants, this one really stands out with its superior customer service, delicious food, and reasonable price. The owner at the store is very friendly. Definitely recommend this place and I will go again in my next visit to Toronto:)"}
{"text":"This place is famous for its wonton soup but I personally go here for the seeju gnow haw (no idea how to say it in english).  Very tasty with the right amount of garlic and black bean.    I wouldn't say the place is clean but it's not particularly dirty given that it is Chinatown. Service is good and the waiters speak Engrish.    Overall I would say that the food is average with a few above average dishes.  Reasonably priced as well.  The clientele can get obnoxious at times given that the restaurant is open so late and as such I prefer to go earlier."}
{"text":"Swatow is one of the popular, cheap hot spots in downtown Toronto. It's always busy and there's always a lineup at the door every time I go which is a good sign. Food comes out very quick and is always served hot and tasty. My fave dish is the noodles w/ shrimp wontons!  The restaurant itself is pretty small but the service is always efficient. Sometimes you can feel a bit rushed to finish eating but that's understandable considering the lineups. I'm a regular here and I'll continue coming back for the consistent food."}
{"text":"Swatow was the first meal after our arrival in Toronto.  It is DELICIOUS TO THE MAX!  I must say, the food here is better than NYC Chinatown!    We ordered:  Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup - Delish! Swatow Special Soup Noodle - Delish! Lobster Special - Could've used a little more salt. Snails in Black Bean Sauce - WO HOP (NYC Restaurant) beats you in that dish.  I would not order at Swatow. Watercress Veggies with Bean Curd Sauce - Cooked just the right way.  Not too soggy and not too raw. Beef with Black Bean over Crispy Noodles - Yummy!!! Beef with Tomatoes over Rice - About the same as NYC Chinatown  Paying in American $$s is also accepted (now that it's dollar for dollar) and the waiters did not give us any problems about that, unlike the peeps from Pacific Mall.    I recommend!"}
{"text":"Not much in way of atmosphere but the food was delicious. Best Mongolian Beef I've ever had. Also loved the Shrimp with Scrambled Eggs on Rice. Soup bowls are huge - husband couldn't even finish his. Definitely share meals if you can take leftovers with you."}
{"text":"Very mediocre Chinese food. After reading good reviews we got some recommended dishes: General Tso chicken was pretty good. But we also got the black bean noodles with chicken- the noodles were hard to chew while the chicken was unpleasantly soft, with globs of bland gelatinous sauce. Despite being raised to finish all my food, I couldn't stand to eat that noodle dish."}
{"text":"Great place for late night food. Fast service, good food, now I know why this place has amazing table turnover. So impressed. Get the beef w. Black bean sauce on fried noodles."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is really sweet, and the food tastes great. Plus you have to love the fact they make their own fish balls. Great value!"}
{"text":"Great place. Informal affordable and delicious you must try the meat with black bean sauce and fried noodles it's unbelievable"}
{"text":"I found the food at Swatow to be kind of... forgettable. Not bad, but not extraordinary. My burly manfriend had a shrimp wonton noodle soup with barbeque pork, which was very good.   Unfortunately, and I don't know if it was just a case of picking the 'wrong thing'... I was not as lucky. I ordered the 'char cheong noodles' (I assume this is to resemble 'jar cheung mian'- the Northern Chinese noodle dish). When I ordered, I was asked a couple of times by the waiter if I was 'sure' I wanted this particular dish. Nope, just pulling your leg! I'm never sure what to make of it when I'm asked this in a Chinese restaurant. 'Chances are, it's going to be a) really good. 'How-could-I-be-missing-out-on-this!?' kind of good. or b) what... the hell is this?    The char cheong noodles were a striking 'b'.  Bright red...? Kind of sweet...? Is that meat...? So many questions.   I would go back, but I would be considerably more wary of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Swatow is great place, for a scrumptious meal. Upon entering the place doesn't look so enticing if you're a first time costume, but it will look quite enticing after trying the food! It does not take long to get a seat around an average time of five minutes, and if the attendance is much more the expected, there will be a line up that heads out a bit outside therefore, forcing you to hold the door open. To some people, this can change an experience and have a negative response to your experience. To me, I don't mind as the food and service redeems for that sole fact. The waiters and owner/manager were amazingly nice and charismatic upon entering the restaurant. Even to new customers and frequent customers. Right upon the start we were offered free tea, which didn't taste so bad for free tea. Then after placing my order, only a mere ten minutes had passed when I was given my order for my Cantonese Fried Noodles, which presentation-wise was rather simple but looked absolutely scrumptious, just looking at it made my mouth water. And the food was cooked to perfection, and every part was just as enjoyable. Sometimes you may see an employee hauling some food to be prepared in the kitchen and sometimes preparing on one of the tables in the dining area, I honestly don't care, but the only downside is less tables therfore more wait times for a table if the event of a line-up, but overall, amazing food and services made the experience incredibly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service... Almost too fast... Nice late night option though even sober, food can be enjoyable."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food you will undoublty have in your entire lifetime. A must try if you've never been and are craving some Chinese food while in the downtown area. Welcoming and great customer service, always a lively environment filled with people who are there to enjoy a good time and have a delicious meal. I would come here a lot more often but I live uptown and downtown is a huge adventure for myself. It is opened till very late so it is a perfect place to eat after a late night downtown adventure before heading back uptown. 10/10 would come again and bring friends."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Ordered the ma posted tofu and the pork was so incredibly tender it fell apart in my mouth before chewing. Great flavor!  The the tong choy veggie dish was delicious too. We ordered the traditional pig's blood with chive dish and it was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place if you don't want dead bugs in your food. I ordered a shrimp wonton noodle soup and a few bites in, I flipped the vegetable and found a dead bug floating in my soup. This made me lose my appetite altogether and when I showed the waiter he didn't even apologize. If this restaurant had decent customer service, they would not charge me for the noodle soup or at the very least give me a discount and apologize. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this place if you are looking for a bug-free dish."}
{"text":"This is the place when you can't decide where to eat.  Great honest chinese food.  Very simple, very fast. Eat and Go. Chicken in black bean sauce is really good."}
{"text":"It's the sort of restaurant Chinese people like: good food for cheap. Don't expect any fancy decor, its not fusion, just classic Cantonese comfort food. I tried the braised beef and wonton, and it was great - beef was tender and the wontons were tasty.   I'm Chinese and am mostly unimpressed with Chinatown, but Swatow was an exception and I'll be back to try their other selections. The restaurant is named after a city near chiuchow, so chiuchow-nese food there should be good."}
{"text":"Been dining here for over a decade! The staffs are always friendly and quick on their feet. This place don't mess around. By the time they take your order, its only as a matter of minutes until your order is brought to your table, picture perfect every single time. This little busy place is definitely one of the best restaurant in China Town. I find that they excel most in their use of their woks! They must have a very powerful stove at their kitchen, because their \"wok hei\" never lets me down. (wok hei is what the Chinese call \"breath of the wok\", its simply thermal energy giving foods a unique concentrated flavour and aroma.)"}
{"text":"Quick and good service, fair price (you can get single rice + item combo type dish for under $10), generous servings. One of the best restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"If you order Shrimp with lobster sauce, you better order some rice. If you still wanna some soup, crap fish soup is fresh and light. Medium is enough for two people. Spring roll is also very tasty for a Pesco vegetarian like me.  I would like to try the shrimp dumpling next time when I go alone."}
{"text":"I have my favourite Chinese restaurant on Spadina, and so do a couple of my friends. So it's inevitable that I would have eaten here a couple times. What I don't understand is how this is their favourite.  In my experience, the food here always tastes too sweet. Especially bad was the Hot and Sour soup, and General Tso's Chicken. The soup is probably the worst I've had in Toronto, and had a ketchup flavour to it. The chicken was bland.   To be fair, I did like the Fukien fried rice I had here.  People seem to love this place, but to me there are better options on the same street."}
{"text":"Amazing late night Chinese restaurant. I had the most delicious soup here. A nice rich beef broth with a bunch of different dumplings, tender beef and bok choy. The service was fast and polite. I'll need to visit and try other dishes but so far I can say this is my favourite Chinese restaurant downtown (not counting dim sum places)."}
{"text":"Their fried noodles are so delicious! You must try it if you are here. Clams taste good too, a bit too salty for me. See pictures"}
{"text":"Was seated at a table, ordered food and then we got shuffled to a smaller table about 10 minutes later. The people who were put there started eating before us even though we ordered about 20 minutes before them. They had all their dishes and we were still waiting for our third of six orders. We ordered an iced lemon tea with less ice and the waitress asked if we wanted one ice cube. we did ended up getting one ice cube and it was like drinking straight syrup with a slice of lemon. While eating, that same waitress stood behind us and stared, making us feel awkward."}
{"text":"Try the noodle in soup with beef brisket and wonton.  Couple that with an order of Chinese salted doughnuts for dipping.  Heavenly.  Hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant best for take-outs, quick dash or drunken after-party meal."}
{"text":"The food is great..services is ok ..price is ok .....things never change in this place  all these years..."}
{"text":"Beef brisket noodle was tasty but not enough edible beef meat. Lots of fatty bits and stuff that looks like skin? I guess for the price u don't get prime cuts. The beefy bits that I did eat was great though."}
{"text":"For most people in the GTA who aren't of asiatic descent, Chinese food has taken on a meaning far from the original, in fact many canadianized Chinese restaurants offer items that aren't even remotely Chinese. Examples of this include chicken balls, almond chicken, and even chicken fingers to name a few. But then, from the midst of the mess that is Canadian Chinese food, emerges Swatow. In a difficult to reach location, especially for those looking to park, Swatow is an incredible restaurant offering incredible food at reasonable prices. They're open late, food is incredible and well priced, and service is fast and friendly- Swatow is a  real treat for those who aren't used to authentic Chinese dishes, and even those are, but are looking for a new spot to try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  To me, same ol same ol food  but service was slow and they messed up my order.  All of that aside it was quick, good portions and great cure to my hangover"}
{"text":"What do you want from a Chinese food restaurant?  Fast service, relatively inexpesive eats, and...  Yeah, that's about it.  And this is what Swatow has.  This place serves up consistently good Chinese food with good portions, nothing fancy and don't go for the ambience but DO try their Hot and Sour soup because it's one of the best in the city.   This is not a date restaurant but good for friends and a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Their food is delicious. My boyfriend and I always get the mapo tofu, beef congee and wanton noodle soup. The guy at the front is super friendly. (Maybe because he and my boyfriend speak the same language) The servers are also very nice and polite. It surprised me because my previous experience at other Chinatown restaurants were that they just don't give a damn about good customer service. It's usually like order, eat, pay and get out. Nothing less, nothing more. The portions are pretty big too so we always have some leftovers to take home and munch on later on the night !"}
{"text":"Where do you go at 2:30 AM in the morning for good reliable food and an alternative to the usual slice of pizza. Swatow is your place. Average tasty greasy chinese food ready to eat in 10 minutes. Busy little spot on Spadina that I've been going to for around 17 years. Of course the frequency of my visits has dropped but I was there last night and nothing has changed. Fast reliable cheap food. Five of us dined for 15 dollars each and stuffed ourselves on 5 different dishes and tea. my favourite has always been the Eggplant and Shrimps. The place was as always still relatively busy at 2:30 AM but we were able to get a table right away which is a rarity in this small place. By the time we were leaving there was a small line up. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Cost: cheap $ - good for late night supper Quality: good hor fun - 85% Decor: poor to none - 60% Staff: almost no service - 60% Value: 80%"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it never disappoints. Staff unbelievably efficient and food tasty and reliable and cheap! Small room that is always busy but totally laid back!"}
{"text":"The go to place for late night snacking. Always a good, piping hot bowl of noodle soup waiting. All kinds recommended, but I typically go for wonton or duck. Congee and long donuts is another favorite. Cantonese fried noodle, mmmmm. Good value."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this restaurant to try out a new Chinese restaurant. Swatow seems to specialize in noodles because I noticed the majority of the dishes are noodle dishes. I ordered the BBQ pork noodles (dry lo mien). It was really good. I regularly go to King's Noodle restaurant which is just across the street and I can say that I prefer the noodles and the BBQ pork here. They also gave a good amount of pak choy.   Portions were huge. It was $10, which is average for Chinatown prices. If you are a fan of noodles, definitely check this place out. I would give this place another shot (maybe eat in next time). However, for rice dishes, I think I might stick with King's Noodle"}
{"text":"Huge portions, delicious food, and a super nice host that will chat with you while you're ordering takeout. Feels really good to eat here. Beef with black bean sauce was never made at home in my family but I can see the dish, as it is cooked here, joining the ranks of my favourite 'home food' cooking."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years!  Honestly the best Chinese I've ever had. The beef with black bean sauce is out of this world. One of the best thing about this place is it's virtually always open and the quality of the dishes are consistently delicious!!    A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Spontaneously tried this joint last night before heading home on my 2 hour commute. It took so much will power not to devour the General Tao Chicken in the subway. Definitely the best tasting chicken I've had! Also the servers were friendly and polite, like a little family welcoming you to their restaurant. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Y'know when you're out past last call and you'd really like some greasy chinese food?  What you really want is to go to Swatow.   Open way late and a big menu with lots of tasty choices.    I consider it a bonus that it has a cheap fast food atmosphere (in fact, I always feel like I'm in a Wendy's) because when it's late, I'm probably a bit messed up myself and wouldn't feel right some place nice.  Also, I was once in there with an 80 year old woman who turned to me and said \"There's too much skin on this chicken.\"  I replied \"that's not chicken, it's tofu.\" She looked at me and said \"I don't care what you call it, but I know chicken, and this chicken has too much skin.\"  Apparently the tofu is chicken."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its placement next to a massage parlour. Swatow is somewhat of a charming joint by Spadina standards, nestled in the heart of Chinatown. For a place that's remarkably clean as it is, the food is spectacular. Although I'm sure some of their dishes use MSG like most east Asian restos in the city, it's a far cry from the Mandarin buffet. Having traveled to the far east, I can tell you this is as authentic as it gets in the city. Try the shrimp wanton noodle soup!"}
{"text":"I always end up here when I'm drunk. Everything is awesome (when I'm drunk).  NOTE it is packed on Friday/Saturday once the clubs start to close down."}
{"text":"Really good food in the heart off Chinatown. One of my favorite places to go add they always seem to be open no matter what time of day it is.  As for the food I highly recommend the black bean beef chow mein. (Crispy noodle with slices of beef and veggies with a slightly spicy sauce) the general Tao chicken is also delicious."}
{"text":"I've had years of okay-good experiences with this place, but it's 2017. Can we get rid of the guy at the front who charges whatever prices he wants? I've gotten the same few items for take out for years. Tonight my meal cost $5 more than normal. Was it because I was wearing a nice coat? Did I look stoned and easy to rip off? Was he just feeling frisky?? Not sure if I can go back here while this guy lingers"}
{"text":"I fuckijg love this place Its the bomb  Recommendations:  Beef fried rice noodles  Yeong chow fried rice Fuk in fried noodles"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a late night snack after clubbing or movie. Very very fast service. Order and a few minutes later the food is right there.  We ordered chow mien and swatow duck. Get the swatow duck! (not the soy braised one) Very crispy skin and perfect for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"We took a risk and we were amazed!  We got there before the lunch rush on Sunday and were promptly seated and served hot tea. When I say hot, I mean burn your mouth hot. Everything was that hot and fresh. We did have to ask for water but it was always full. The portions are generous and they bring some great favors!   The hot and sour soup is amazing!  The spring rolls and pan fried dumplings were good. The black bean beef with crispy noodles was good. The Szechuan vegetables in hot sauce were great. It was also reasonably priced for our meal. They only accept cash and the food comes out fast. I would go love to go back!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best restaurants in Chinatown Toronto for years!. Looks very simple from the outside and one can pass it by without a second glance.   But when you step inside it's clean.   The food is dine-in restaurant quality, not take out quality compared to what I find at a majority of Chinatown establishments. They have some chef specialties and some rare items like the Yin-Yang fried rice.  Only thing I don't like is cash only policy.   This restaurant prides itself on their food. People who know are regulars and keep coming back.   Service is courteous and prompt to boot."}
{"text":"Love this place but avoid the char cheung. Not sooo good and i have such regret I didn't order something better."}
{"text":"This place serve authentic Cantonese food late into the night. Service was efficient."}
{"text":"We took a stab at this place since we were in from Cali and was awesome.  Small place yet the food was as good at higher in places I've been too in San Francisco.  Everyone was super nice.  Only thing the 5 of us agreed we would change is to add more than Budweiser to the menu.  Roasted Duck is a must and we ordered more even after being totally full.  Oh only catch we just found out...CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Came here for the soup on a cold day. Seemed like it was the thing to get, as all tables around me were eating soup. Ended up getting the duck noodle soup which was really rich and delicious.  Overall, good food, but the service isn't great. We asked for water 3 times and felt a little rushed while eating."}
{"text":"Great quick service with medium-large servings.  Food is all fresh.  The meat was just above standard and the vegetables were amazing and crisp.  Highly recommended for a midnight meal with your friends and to duck away from the cold. Its easy to order too much.  Pricing is very affordable."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants in my day, in New York, London, Los Angeles, as well as Toronto and many other cities. This is by far the worst I've ever had. It wasn't disgusting or anything, it just had no taste. The Chicken with cashews looked and tasted like it had been boiled in water. The \"spicy garlic chicken\" had no taste whatsoever. The sweet and sour soup tasted like they mixed ketchup and water and put it in the microwave.  The food is pretty pricey too, so I would emphatically urge you to  avoid this place."}
{"text":"Don't let this hole in the wall deter you from going in.  My favorites are:       Shrimp wonton egg noodle soup - the wontons are huge      Congee with shrimp and squid  The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Swatow Cuisine: Chinese Location: Chinatown Address: 309 Spadina Ave Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  *Middle of Chinatown *Open till late *Specialize in Cantonese noodles *Cash ONLY  Recommendations: Fried Rice, Sizzling Meat Dishes  Swatow is another busy Chinese restaurant located near Dundas and Yonge. It's usually packed with people but the wait wasn't bad when I went. It's only cash at Swatow so make sure to check your wallet before coming here.  We had to wait around 5 minutes before we were seated. Waitress here actually spoke proper english! I love it :) Anyways, their menu varies from the typical soup noodles, dry noodles, fried rice, seafood and meat dishes. Once we ordered, food came very fast so there was not much wait time there.  Ordered: BEEF STEW (HO FUN) NOODLE SOUP- 2/5  *This came in a small snack size bowl and was $4.88 *Soup was a clear light broth made from vegetables and meat *Rice noodle is thin and soft so it breaks very easily *Veggies and Meat pieces on top of the noodle *Meat was tender but too soft *I prefer thicker noodles and stronger spicy broth  Ordered: YEUNG CHOW FRIED RICE- 5/5  *Fried rice is always a safe option at Chinese restaurants especially Yeung Chow style because it has meat, seafood and veggies. *This fried rice was big in portion and had lots of shrimp + BBQ pork pieces *Stir fried egg is added when the rice is cooked and it gives that yellow color *Overall well seasoned and I didn't even need hot sauce for this *This was one of the best fried rice I ever had and I've tried so many different fried rices!  Ordered: SIZZLING BEEF STEW- 4/5  *This seemed to be one of their specialty dishes as many tables around me were ordering them *Notice the name 'Sizzling', it comes in a hot black stone bowl and takes extra 5-10 minute to prepare *It comes covered in tissue paper because it's so hot the sauce can explode in your face *This dish came with lots of beef and turnip pieces *I would eat this with plain rice since it is heavily drenched in sauce *The sauce is based on strong soy sauce flavor *Beef pieces were soft and tender *Turnip was cooked thoroughly and seasoned all the way inside with the sauce *Green onion that was added to the dish was fresh and went well with the dish  The only issue I had with this restaurant is that they rush you out. Yes, I understand that it's a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown and to be honest why would I want to sit there for hours....BUT just let me take my time paying and wipe my mouth with a tissue Ok? But then I guess it is a very busy restaurant and they don't care to shower you with ambiance so it's somewhat understandable.   Summary: Note that it's not one of the cheapest chinese restaurants located in Chinatown but I would come back to Swatow if I wanted some good ol fried rice!"}
{"text":"We visited for late night eats this weekend. It was packed as usual and brusque and efficient was usual. Of 6 of us at table we each ordered something different and did not share dishes. One girl could not stomach the taste of her food and ate only two bites. The rest of us ate normally and paid the price.  I was kept awake half the night with stomach cramps. One guy got ballistic diarrhea most of the next day and two others in the group were also ill to their stomachs.  I leave you to draw your own conclusions.   Swatow? Just say NO!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times for noodle and soup type dishes, nothing wows me but it's all pretty consistent.  I want to come back for the fried rice and the Cantonese Fried Noodles since I'm curious about what others enjoyed here."}
{"text":"This is the first time Yelp has let me down. I'm from out of town and was looking for some great Chinese food. Chinatown in TO has quite a few rated at 4 stars so I picked this one at random. I ordered a combo platte. The food was really greasy. The hot and soup was really strange and too suite. The combo comes with a spring roll that was not served. I asked about it and they tried to charge me extra.  When I went to pay, the only accept cash and I had USD. I paid with a 20$ and got change with no exchange rate applied. I picked up the change and the owner said \"No tip for us?\"  I said, \"I just tipped you 30 %\"  (one USD = 1.30 Canadian).  I'll go elsewhere next time thank you."}
{"text":"I caught myself by surprise that I actually have never been to this amazing Chinese diner before.  Swatow is a small scale Chinese restaurant but with a LOT of food items on their menu.  I was here on a Wednesday night around 8pm, lined up wasn't too bad, I would say I waited for 10min max.  This is also due to the fact that they serve food pretty fast and people just eat and go.  That being said, their service is def better than most of the resto in China Town Toronto.  Beer - Only ONE TYPE, Budweiser, I found it pretty odd they do not carry Tsang Tao - $5 pretty steep  House Special Noodles - Good selection of various items on their menu, fish balls, beef balls, squid balls, tribes, beef brisket with egg noodles in soup - Texture of the noodles done right, ie not over cooked and chewy - Broth is flavorful and I did not need to add ANY additional sauce because it is that good  Clam with Black Bean sauce - Sauce done perfect, very tasty, full of black bean taste - Clams are fresh and portion was good  Fuk-kin Fried Rice - Ordered this as other yelpers have recommended.  Not my kind of Fuk-kin fried rice, it is not bad but nothing wows me. Just another saucy chinese style fried rice and I have had better in even just Congee Wong  Deep Fried Squid - Pretty good for a snack, they have used chinese style salt that gives another hint of asian style  Service - Absolutely amazing, genuine and friendly!!   Downside: Cash only... pretty inconvenient, but you kind of have to accept that...  Will def come back for their noodles as the broth is really good and the texture of noodles are not easy to find I recommend anyone to come here for a quick dinner Family welcomed"}
{"text":"Quick meal that reminds me of authentic Hong Kong restaurants. Would definitely recommend. Large portions, great prices, delicious and quick!!!"}
{"text":"First time here ordered black pepper beef spicy to go. I could almost drive back it was so good. PS it's not on the menu.  Had the Shanghai noodles which were okay. Will go back for more, need a good comfort food joint."}
{"text":"The noodles & fried rice are okay, but the service is really bad, especially the cashier, his attitude force me not to go back again."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of swatow, but after yesterday's experience it left me upset and disappointed.  Took a friend out for lunch and ordered shrimp dumpling soup which was good as always. Than ordered general tao chicken and a side of steamed vegetables. The \"steamed vegetables\" turned out to be just steam Chinese brocolli (a bit misleading). The bigger issue I had was when I found a thick elastic band in my general tao chicken. At first I thought maybe it was a piece of tofu covered in sauce, but after further inspection it turned out it was 100% an thick elastic band.   I called the server over and pointed out elastic band in my dish. She then asked if I want a re order or have it removed from my bill. In my opinion, i think I should of been comped my whole meal but I am not one to argue.   I wasn't going to originally post this review since I did enjoy this restaurant prior. But I figured it'd be better to warn others so that they can be aware in case it happens again."}
{"text":"This is *the* spot in Toronto to get Chinese late night food. You cannot go wrong their fried noodles, particularly Beef with Black Bean Sauce and Fried Noodles or Beef with Satay Sauce and Fried Noodles.  It's an old establishment that doesn't change much. The guys have been around for years and know their regulars. This is not the kind of place to sit around and lounge, it's fast and the servers yell orders at each other. But the food comes fast, fresh and hot and leaves you feeling wholly satisfied."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this place, amazing! Whether your here grabbing a wonton soup for lunch, take out for dinner or late night grub after a night on the town. The quality of the food never changes any time of the day.   Dining in I get quite a few things:  1. Spicy shrimp with lobster sauce on fried rice - This dish never disappoints!  2. Beef brisket on fried rice - The hearty combination hits the spot! 3. Lemon chicken - Reading this off the menu you wouldn't think to order it but trust me it's good! 4. Spicy beef satay on sizzling plate - Spicy epicness on a plate. 5. Beef in black bean sauce on fried noodle - Skip the regular chow mein, this is where it's at! 6. Spicy calamari - You can never go wrong.  Just remember, anything rice dish should ALWAYS be changed to fried rice."}
{"text":"Came here last year and felt this place deserved a 5 star... Suffice it to say that I'm sad its quality has since gone down. Though to be fair, the dishes we ordered were vastly different.  Last time, we ordered their chow mein, famous wonton noodles, fried intestine, etc. The chow mein was very crispy and tasty, while the wonton noodles were delicately thin and extremely al dente. We were blown away by the quality of the noodles. The fried intestines were also extremely crispy, with none of the dreaded odour lingering behind.  However, we decided to order something different today. My friend got the hot and sour soup, I got the braised beef brisket and beef tendon with rice noodles, and my dad got the stir fried shrimp egg ho fun. The hot and sour soup was a disappointment. Though the waitress warned us beforehand that their version was sweeter, I found it to be sickeningly sweet. It literally tasted like a bottle of sweet sauce. The colour, a bright orange, was also off-putting.  The beef brisket and tendon was no better. The sauce was way too sweet, and lacked any depth or other flavour. They definitely added sugar during the braising process to quicken the procedure, and this was undoubtedly reflected in the poor quality.  The best dish was the stir fried ho fun (flat rice noodles). There was a generous portion of shrimp, and the noodles were al dente. And no wonder why! Turns out the simple trick is to stir fry it beforehand, and then add the runny egg on top. Unfortunately, I still found there to be too much cornstarch added to the egg, which gave it a slightly greasy and slimy texture."}
{"text":"Great \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurant just on the outskirts of Kensington Market as well as the Art Gallery of Ontario. In a sea of Chinese restaurants, Swatow stands out because of the affordability and quality of the food. The gf and I were overwhelmed by the delicious of everything on the menu but both opted for noodle soup. The fish ball soup came with generous helpings of fish balls, fish cakes, and gai lan and was full of flavor. As for the shrimp dumpling noodle soup, it came with four huge shrimp dumplings that were simply amazing and complemented the light noodle soup well. Both dishes also had noodles that were well cooked and perfect for the weary traveler's stomach.   The only issue we ran into was their cash only policy. Coming from the US, we had no Canadian money and ended up on a wild 30 minute hop from bank to bank before we were able to get some money from the nearby Scotia Bank which accepted Visa debit cards. If only they accepted credit cards...."}
{"text":"Tightly squeezed restaurant. We were seated quickly even with a party of 7, I was impressed. The servers really hustle to clean tables, take orders and bring food out. Each table has complimentary tea which was different for me, but good. The food came out quick fast and hot to my surprise. I was happy with my food choice of vegetable fried rice, it was tasty. Everyone else was happy with their meal choices as well."}
{"text":"Like Kom Juk Yuen this place is a 70's icon and an institution in old chinatown. I use to end up here at 2am on weekends for all those street food dishes. Credit for its service to th epublic and afterhours crowd for 30 plus years. The place is clean serive is prompt no frills but the food is still chino canadiano. Come when your toasted it will definitely taste the best that way."}
{"text":"The service is amazing. I love the crew who is there. Very friendly and loves to talk to their customers! Food is amazingly good. And the size you get it huge. But it's a very small place. Needs to expand."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Prices could be better though. But they tend to cater to mostly non-asian customers and hence, can charge a little more (white people...am I right? haha)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere Hole in the wall.  Dirty. Tables and chairs run down. No waiting area when waiting to be seated. Service All the waitresses were nice besides one. I was waiting to be seated and was standing by the area that the beverages were and one of the waitresses moved my arm out of the way so she can get a soda can for a customer. She didn't even say excuse me or anything. I'm not sure if she spoke English but regardless, being polite has nothing to do with the language she speaks or doesn't speak!  Food/Beverage The shrimp and eggplant over rice was pretty good. There were about ten medium sized shrimp and a good amount of eggplant cooked and flavored perfectly. It normally comes spicy but I requested it to be non spicy. Serving could be shared with two people but I didn't eat the rice so I ate the rest myself!  As far as my beverage, I asked for water. I saw one of the waitresses literally get it from the same faucet that they probably wash some dishes with. There was no filter on it either. I changed my mind and asked her to give me a bottled water.  Other info: Cash only Prices are average  Metered parking  Side note: Weirdest thing to me was that there was a chef cooking some food right in the front by the register.  I was completely thrown off by that. They have another chef in the back as well which was more common.   If I decided to visit Toronto in the future and wanted Chinese food, I will most likely try another place. The food was good but the thought of that chef in the front and how run down that establishment was, just threw me off completely."}
{"text":"Food was super salty. Not really a fan of this place but I know alot of people hype it up. Good place when your drunk."}
{"text":"Not at good as 'Taste of China Seafood Restaurant' across the street  - nor as charming. seriously, just walk across the street their General Tso is way better!"}
{"text":"The only time I've been to Swatow is for late night noshing usually after the bars close and a group of us are too buzzed from the evening to go straight home to bed. There aren't many restaurants even open past the 2 am last call Toronto bar closing time, let alone staffed properly where sometimes inebriated patrons can be too much to handle. This is when Chinatown has always been a popular place to go, and Swatow proudly delivers. It's something about the bright white fluorescent lights, and the thin and wiry waiters in their black and whites milling around the small place, staying out of your face, yet magically stepping in when they need to be there almost using a sixth sense. A group of us visited twice recently, with one night being a Sunday. It was an early concert we went to. As we were seated, the waiters slid each of us a can of Budweiser as we sat at the round table, a comforting sight even after having a few earlier in the evening. Then they set the table with machine gun precision and deftness after which they disappeared letting us peruse the menu. They tolerate a little rowdiness at this restaurant and maintain their cool, no matter what happens. Settling in, we could talk about the best parts of the evening, without worrying about being overheard in the din. Then, as the evening dragged on, we realized that we were the only people left in Swatow that Sunday night, as the staff went into maintenance mode, watering and trimming the plants and tidying up. We made our way out onto chilly and dark Spadina as the staff piled into their SUV and cheerfully said good night! Oh, and the food is perfect adjunct to a night out with friends :)"}
{"text":"Every time I have a hankering for super fast Chinese food in Chinatown this is it.  Atmosphere: Very humble small family restaurant.Not the fanciest place but clean and standard for Chinatown. Bathroom is down the stairs and very tight squeeze.   Service:If you want quick service this is it, runs like a well oiled machine! The optimization of efficiency at its best, seeing as more tables served = more revenue! Language like most places in Chinatown is limited.  Food: Good authentic food! Some standouts are their crab corn soup that you need to add chili oil too and a side of fried dough, Shrimp in lobster sauce and pepper beef."}
{"text":"A Chinese restaurant that never disappoints me. I've been going to this restaurant for more than 7 years, the taste is always consistent."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and ordered dozens of dishes. None of them were disappointing. Everything was well made and packed with flavour. Price is very reasonable and you get pretty big portions. You can't go wrong with the food here! The place is smaller than expected and there might be a bit of a wait but it is definitely worth it. Servers are friendly and attentive. Definitely recommended. Cash only."}
{"text":"Great go to place in China Town. Try the soups which I feel are really good. Very good for the price and one of the better joints in China Town."}
{"text":"Saw this on BlogTO and was really hyped to try out a new place in Chinatown. I only ordered the beef fried rice noodle (substituted veggies for beef) but was pretty disappointed. The noodles were overly saucy compared to how this dish is usually made, and they weren't as wide as the rice noodles usually are at most places. Also, when I asked to add tofu in the dish the staff did not know whether it would be a $1 or $2 extra charge. As a customer, I would like to know what I will be charged before I order. Portions are quite generous though for what you pay. There are more authentic places in Chinatown serving the same dish that I would rather go to."}
{"text":"This place is the best and I know many of you agree.  The food is great, the service is friendly, and the prices are very reasonable.  I've been going there for so many years that most of the workers there know my name and it's great to have that familiarity.  I have my staple dishes when I go there but your eally can't go wrong with much there.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait to get in .. Line moves pretty fast - food is good and reasonably inexpensive.  Enjoyed it"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????TT"}
{"text":"Very authentic and genuine! Just like home and in LA. In fact, the beef and noodles are very fresh! Didn't care for the wonton though as it only has shrimp in it. Im used to the traditional way with both shrimp and pork mixed in it. That is just a preference though. Go early as this little place gets jam packed with long waits or go during odd hours.  Wonton and beef noodle soup- Genuine and yummy. Just like it is in LA.  Pan fried rice noodle with beef- This was amazing here! Very flavorful with a very good wok-fire taste! Beef was one of the best I had in this dish compared to LA. Yum!!  Service:  This was meh but then again everyone was running around like chicken without a head. Staff were a bit rude at times too but sucks to admit thats just how some grouchy busy asian can be when its super busy. They mean no harm so i forgive them because another minute later, their smiling with you again. Sigh...  Prices: Very descent as portions were pretty generic and generous."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!   The food is quite authentic.  I feel like the dishes are generally on the sweet side to accommodate local preferences,  but it's all good.    My go-to dish is the steamed oyster with garlic.  I also like their dishes that come in pots or served on iron plates. The food is hot (temperature-wise) and delicious and nice to eat with rice. Usually I spend about $20 per person per meal."}
{"text":"Came here at 2 am on Saturday night after a very disappointing drink next door.  Got a huge portion of General Tso and Chile Beef for not too expensive. I was two sheets to the wind so my taste buds may have been in retreat mode, but I really enjoyed the food. I'll have to come back when more sober to write a non 2 am review."}
{"text":"I've have been here quite a few times with family and friends. it is a high  volume place with line ups almost every time i'm here. They have a vast menu which can satisfy anyone. The food never disappoints and I have never had any problem with the service. Even though it is a high volume place with some may people coming and going. Don't expect much by looking at it. It is typical Chinese greasy spoon if I can use that term. I would say the dishes are somewhat North Americanized for you palate. Great for family."}
{"text":"This is your bare bones Chinese food joint with good and cheap food. I absolutely love love love the shrimp dumpling soup ($6-7) which you can get with noodles if you like, beef in black bean sauce ($10-12), and the Yeung chow fried rice ($10-11). Honestly though a lot of their food is good and so affordable. I usually do take out; the service is quick and friendly. I've never had a bad experience here, even on a busy Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Swotow really is my favourite Chinese noodle house. I've been coming here for over a decade and it's never let me down.  The decor and lighting make this place seem like a hole in the wall but the food is absolutely fantastic! Funnily, the servers haven't changed in as long as I've been coming here and it's fun to see a few of the guys starting to lose their hair as they get older.   I have never had a bad experience eating here; from the Congee, to the many different noodle dishes, to veggie and meat plates. The service is FAST, the prices are great, and the food is always a treat on the pallet. As I think about Swatow while writing this review, I'm surprised that I don't go here more often. :P haha!"}
{"text":"Been going to Swatow for 20+ years. Best shrimp wonton soup I've ever had. Their hot and sour soup is also amazing. Have never had a bad meal here in 20 years."}
{"text":"My date enjoyed the fish congee but the spring roll had so much oil oozing out of it the napkin was drenched by the time it hit the table. Service was good and lightening fast but I highly doubt that the slick, congealing grease in the sauce on the fried tofu and broccoli could actually have been vegetarian, so I'm not going back. However, if meaty-greasy-MSG-y is your jam, this could be your spot. Particularly for late night dining."}
{"text":"God, I love this place. It's not clean, people are not friendly, foods just lands on your table in family style, the washroom... YIKES stay away, middle of China town.  It my absolute favorite Chinese/Cantonese restaurant in all my travels. I will still drive an hour downtown to enjoy this place.  Cantonese fried noodle, pan fried dumpling, general tso's chicken, beef with black bean on rice.... so SO many great options.  Think I'll head down again tonight.."}
{"text":"This place is rrally good. My first night in toronto and I wanted to eat something that will remind me of hong kong and this place did just that. We had beef ball lai fun and fish cake mei fun. Both great and they added beef stew sauce for free into our soup. Tasted amazing for very cheap price."}
{"text":"You're drunk & hungry and find yourself downtown at 2 in the morning. Where do you go for quick, tasty, and well priced eats? The Swatow! Located in the underbelly of chinatown.   This place is a U of T institution and post drunk destination for many a toronto club goer. I never did ask the host what his name is, been seeing him for years and he always welcomes you with a warm smile.   Service is lightning fast, huge portions and the MSG buzz mixes nicely with the drunk buzz or whatever else ya got goin on.   So skip the street meat and go here instead...do it!  P.S. You gotta try the Hot & Sour Soup here, it's freakin great -  drunk or sober!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall, the place could use a face lift, but the food! OMG! Its delicious!!! My personal fave is the chow mein. Amazing. Any dish i've tried here is fantastic. Its always busy, so pack your patience. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past and although the food is fair compared to others around(Chinatown doesn't have good food anyways) the service is one of the worst I have ever seen.  They pride themselves on the old newspaper reviews written in the past(mostly by white people who don't know what good Chinese food) they don't value customers. They serve you the bill before you even finish your meal(a message saying, hurry up and eat your food then get out).  It is worth a try but don't be surprised if they rush you to leave."}
{"text":"Yum!  For a quick, bite, go for their shrimp dumpling noodle soup!  It's made up of delicious, plump shrimp dumplings that are pretty much a more glamorous version of wontons, plentiful noodle, and as a bonus, greenery in the form of a couple of stalks of Chinese veggie that's not lettuce.  I find that places like these don't often include quality veggie with their already cheap offerings, so I'm very happy plunking down my dollars at Swatow for their delicious noodle and quick, no fuss service."}
{"text":"I have been here for 7years.  Food is always good tasty and fast service   but service is mediocre."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch:  3 minute wait for a table for two.  Food delivered within 5 minutes!  This is a no frills small restaurant.  Patrons are diverse - speaks volumes right there:  heard Portuguese conversation, group of 11 Caucasian guys celebrating a birthday, Pakistani couple, Vietnamese.  It's great.  Chinese tea served when you are seated.  Scrambled egg and shrimp:  delicious but too salty.  Large shrimp and plentiful! Beef stew and tendon lo mein :  served with a few pieces of greens, flavorful and tender beef chunks. Good!  Fortune cookies to end the meal.  A convenient go-to place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This place used to be decent back in the day but it seems to me that the quality of food has diminished and the prices have crept up."}
{"text":"Oh my god. I grew up in HK, I've lived in NYC, LA, and SF, and this place has the best beef brisket I've ever had in my life. There are different layers of taste and it is so moist. The ones over rice has better sauce than the ones with the noodle soup, but seriously all their dishes could easily put any Chinese restaurants in SF to shame. Legendary."}
{"text":"I was craving some Chinese food so we decided to drop by here.   We ordered the sweet and sour pork with rice, egg plant with shrimp and rice, and squid ball soup.   I know sweet and sour pork is westernized Chinese food, but it's one of my favourite dishes.  I've tried this particular dish at many Chinese restaurants, and I really enjoyed this one. The pork still retained the crispy texture and wasn't soggy despite being covered in sauce. I like that it still had a crunchy batter without being too oily. The sauce also had the right balance of sweet and sourness.   The eggplant and shrimp dish was also pretty good. The shrimp and eggplant was cooked perfectly. The eggplant was nicely had a nice texture soft and not to oily.   The squid ball soup was good. It's a lighter soup broth that comes with some green vegetables.   I'll be back when I'm craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 13 around 1:30 PM on a Saturday. Looking in, it seemed really busy. But then I realized the entire wall was a mirror so the place looked twice as large...  Wasn't very big inside, with maybe 8 or 10 tables of varying sizes. We were worried that they wouldn't be able to accommodate the group, but they said no problem: they just re-arranged a rectangular table next to a round table and a 13-seat table was now available in the back.  Most dishes are priced around $11, but they come in massive plates; this seems to be a trend in cantonese restaurants.  What caught my attention was the $5.50 noodle soups, however my experience with other places that offered cheap noodle soups weren't that great.  I got the $10 house special noodle soup, and it came in a massive bowl that was twice the size of the $5 bowls. However, both sizes were quite substantial, and comes with lots of noodles and a good amount of meat/vegetables. A $10 bowl is likely good enough for two people. Flavor of the soup was good, and you can taste it in the noodles. Apparently you also have the choice of egg noodles or rice noodle.  Fortune cookies are offered at the end. Bill can be split, but you'll have to go up to pay. Cash only.  Good place for lunch/dinner, if you manage to get a seat!"}
{"text":"If you got the late-night muchies and want some Chinese, this is the place. The service is fast, food is decently delicious (your exp may vary based on your sobriety), and cheap! No complaints here!"}
{"text":"One of the better places in Chinatown for traditional Chinese food.  Popular spot with the late night clubbing crowd.  The food is consistently good, but overpriced.  Friendly staff and fast and efficient service.  It can get busy at times but the wait won't be long.  Watch out for Big Boss who only works the night shift.  He has a mean look that means business and staff is visibly scared of him.  He rules from behind the cash register with an iron fist and does not hesitate shortchanging you if you show any sign of inebriation.  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL IF BIG BOSS IS BEHIND THE CASH REGISTER.  Payment is cash only.  If you find a discrepancy (trust me you will) DO NOT argue with Big Boss.  Just casually mention it to your waiter when Big Boss is not looking and he will re-adjust your bill.  You have to be very tactful because Big Boss sees EVERYTHING.  Do not fcuk with Big Boss.  The hot & sour soup is pretty good.  So are the sizzling plates and beef with blackbean sauce.  The portions are large and can be shared between two people.  The restaurant was cited for violations and closed a while ago, but the cleanliness is likely at par with other joints in the area.  I have personally eaten at this place many times and taken many people with me, and no one got sick. The dishes are over-priced but with so few choices of good food in the area, where else can you eat?"}
{"text":"Among most restaurants among the Spadina strip, this is one of those which for some reason seem to alwasy come up as a heavy weight.   Ask anyone who likes to eat Chinese food on the strip and they will all mention Swatow at one point or another.   To put it quite simply they are pretty strong when it comes to almost all their dishes --at least for a non-Chinese customer like me, although there are a lot of Asian customers so, that's a good thing. Their seafood, beef and chicken dishes are always tasty.    They are generally always packed and they are friendly to the late-night clubber crowd. So if you come after midnight, expect the place to be packed and there be a waiting line of starving, semi-drunken people waiting in queue to be served.   Their prices are not bad, on the south side of cheap, but overall pretty standard for the neighbourhood. Which brings me to the point that in the end you are coming for the food, not the service nor ambiance, so expect those to be spartan and utilitarian, oh, as a rule of thumb, like most restaurants in the strip, expect a language barrier with your server.   But the food is tasty. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Took the family here while spending a day in Toronto. The place is a perfect hole-in-the-wall in all the right ways except being cash only. According to Yelp it was the place to go and we were not disappointed. I have 3 young kids and they loved the crispy noodles, veggi plate and shirmp fried rice. All in all this was a big hit. The only reason I give this just 4 stars was because they had one little sign (that I completely missed) on the way in saying \"cash only\". Since they are probably mostly catering to Toronto locals everyone knows this fact; but for out of town folks a note on the menu or something would have been nice. Foodwise this place was fantastic but just be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"after stopping by for lunch with my partner, I am sad to say that I will no longer be returning to this hole in the wall.... literally. I witnessed a baby cockroach on our table that crawled into the wall where the tiles splits and meets the metal. Not to mention I found more shell and a shrimp tail in my wontons..... bye bye"}
{"text":"Nothing special here but the quick service and typical chinese food. For some reason I thought it would be a larger space but it looks bigger from the outside. I had the beef with black bean sauce over rice and the wife had the won ton noodle soup. It's pretty tasty. I would definitely come back for the won ton noodle soup. One of the best won ton noodle soup I've had."}
{"text":"If you go out in Toronto, you know about the late night Chinese food scene. That greasy stuff that helps sobers you up (a bit) and hopefully minimizes the hang over the next day (although it certainly won't minimize your waistline).   There's quite a few options for Torontonians, and more often than not, you might get end up with acid reflex or a serious case of... stomach flu we'll call it... the next day.    Swatow is a shining beacon in a sea of MSG, acid-reflex inducing late night Chinese places in Toronto. I'm SO glad a friend recommended this place to us, no longer do I need to suffer the unbearable toilet sitting marathons every Sunday!"}
{"text":"\"Hole-in-the-wall\" is indeed a good description of this small restaurant.  A friend and I ordered bowls of duck noodle soup and then shared a plate of eggplant and shrimp in hot sauce.  The soup contained a fair amount of duck, some noodles that reminded me of instant ramen, and a bit of bok choy.  Mostly it was liquid, and I found the liquid to be greasy and not especially tasty.  The eggplant and shrimp dish was straight-on good; I'd order it again.  The only alcohol available on the premises was Molson lager.  I ordered a can and drank about half of it but regretted the absence of something more interesting.  The restaurant does not take credit cards.  This information is not exactly a secret, but it was news to me.  Although I had almost no Canadian money on me, my friend had stopped by an ATM and was able to produce the required currency.  This restaurant is visibly a good value, and the fact that it's open late was a real plus for us.  While it's not the best restaurant on the block, I'm glad that we swung by."}
{"text":"We were recommend this place as the best chinese food on spadina. Ithas your basic chinese restaurant decor but the food was amazing. We had the orange chicken with spring rolls and fried dumplings.  Orange chicken was delicious specialty but the spring rolls had cinnamon which made themunique and fantastic. Dumplings were some of the biggest we ever seen prices are very affordable and services fast. Swatow did except US currency."}
{"text":"Re-visiting Swatow after many years... this place has an important spot my young adult/university memories.  The food is still as delicious as I remember and the price is unbeatable - $5.99 for my favourite fish sliced noodle soup.  Similar to some reviews, don't expect too much service but there is usually no complain."}
{"text":"Writing this review brings tears to my eyes because this restaurant reminds me of my late father so much.  Nostalgia. This was the restaurant that he and my mom used to go all the time after they finished playing at the casino and one of the only few, if not the only one that was open way back over 10 years ago.    They brought me here one time and raved about their foods.  I was so excited to try it.   A few great items to try:  -Wonton -beef in black been sauce with rice -satay beef fried -beef with rice noodles -any fried rice is excellent -sweet sour chicken -beef and Chinese broccoli -deep fried spicy squid  I've always recommended this restaurant to many friends and they always compliment my suggestion as their food never fails."}
{"text":"The best Peking duck, especially when you've been tearing it up on the weekend."}
{"text":"It was quite an unexpected good eats find. This is a hole-in-a-wall type place. The price is befitting to the quality you receive. There were many typical and some interesting menu choices. This is definitely a place to hit-up when options are low and hunger tensions are high. Mind you, you are here strictly for the food and not for service, there are lapse in customer service but I'll overlook that for good food.  We ordered the general Tao Chicken. Nice and crispy with a nice generous covering of their sweet spicy sauce. The vegetable were fresh and crisp, simple looking with a hit of flavor. It is priced higher than the typical surrounding restaurants but the execution of the dish warrants a taste. We enjoyed the fried intestines too. Nicely prepared, no off-putting taste or smell and fried to crispy yet chewy perfection. The dish came cheap and plentiful. I only wish that there were some pickled carrots and radish on the side to cut through the fattiness and oily texture. It was served with a sweet and sour sauce, though I liked the sauce, I didn't feel that it was the best pairing as it made the dish heavier. The creamy tomato sauced fried rice was bomb. So good. The amount to shrimps served with the dish was impressive; perfectly cooked-not chewy or dried. The sauce and rice were flawlessly seasoned and left us satisfied.  The meal was delicious. I am so glad to have found a new to-go place for late-night Chinese food. I loved the low-key, easy going vibe. Service was fast and food served within 10min of ordering. A place for a quick bite during lunch or a lazy date..."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Swatow. Not much has changed. The 3 waiters are still there and the food is the same as it was when I visited about 5 years ago.    For a Chinatown greasy spoon, it's definitely a gem for Toronto if you need a quick cheap fix."}
{"text":"Returned for early dinner after 15 years! Food is still incredibly delicious and they give you decent portions."}
{"text":"Something about this place I just love.. Their noodle soups are the best with wonton, dumpling, bbq etc. Fried noodle dishes great, love the black pepper beef tenderloin on rice but my wife hates me when I order it because the pieces are so big and I try and fit them in my mouth. They do give you a butter knife to cut it up.. Wtf.. Dishes I've had general tsao was ok not great... Pan fried dumplings awesome.. This is my go to noodle place in toronto."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Toronto because of yelp reviews.  We had General Tso, broccoli beef, noodles, dumplings. All dishes were very good. Quick serve, nothing fancy.  Servers very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for a number of years, and each time is better than the last !    Small place, and sometimes you share a table with another group and that make the visit even better as you always end up trying something new when you see someone else order it.  The service is great, never have to wait very long and the food is outstanding !!  Priced very reasonably. So many wonderful items on the menu that I don't think I have a favourite.    A must go place when your in Chinatown !"}
{"text":"An unassuming spot serving up affordable Fukien dishes. I'll be honest - if I was not dragged in here, I would not have stepped in myself.   We ordered the General Tso chicken, shrimp wonton soup, bbq pork fried rice, and the fried wontons.  General Tso chicken (3/5): this seems to be the dish to order here. While exactly what you would expect in a General Tso chicken, I did not find it particularly mind-blowing. I do appreciate that there is substantial real meat in there, instead of 90% batter which you usually get at similar restaurants.  Shrimp Wonton Soup (5/5): for ~5 bucks, you can enjoy a full meal with this dish. The wontons tasted fresh, the noodles were bouncy, and the soup was light.   BBQ pork fried rice (4/5): The rice was not too dry, and there are quite a bit of bbq pork chunks in there.   Fried wontons (3/5): probably least value for money. I also felt that the sweet and sour sauce was not the best complement to the wontons in my own opinion.  A great alternative for a simple, affordable meal!"}
{"text":"Pro-tip: Avoid this place when it's too busy...  Not as greasy as the rest of the Chinese food in Chinatown. No frills atmosphere. Feels a little bit more authentic and they have their hometown regional orders here.   The special noodle soup is recommended, filled with various delicious ingredients including rich inners.   You write down your own order. Cash only. Comes with fortune cookie. Don't be surprised if they seat you with strangers."}
{"text":"somewhat overpriced for mediocre chinese dishes.  Don't order Cantonese chowmein - tastes flat, or let's say \"noodle and oil\" flavour.  Ironically, the Chinese-style beef tenderloin was tough."}
{"text":"This place has EXCELLENT Chinese food. It's hard sometimes to navigate around Chinatown and find a good place that has great food at a great price. Well this has both. The food here is phenomenal. I always get the chicken noodles and veggies and it's delicious. The lemon chicken is also super duper tasty.   They're no frills here though - the service is fast but not the friendliest. But they are quick and the food is always hot and consistently tasty. Don't run around China Town looking for a place to enjoy some authentic Asian cuisine. Head here and dig in to some really delicious grub!"}
{"text":"Great tasty food, Fu-Kin fried rice was very good, as well as stuffed tofu, Gai-Lan vegetable and pan-fried pot stickers.  Although there was a mix up initially where an older (but not elderly) couple who came in 15 minutes after we did was seated before we did, my friend was quite upset about it when the manager didn't make any effort to rectify the situation, we almost left if not for my friend who knew I really wanted to try this place out, although she was not even going to eat anything until I eventually convinced her to try some food, which she liked.  At the end the manager offered 10% off the bill and a quick but sincere apology without us asking.  I would likely not return in the future if not for this final gesture."}
{"text":"It's a fast-and-furious, hit-and-miss, hole-in-the-wall. The noodle soups have depth and done al dente (beef brisket and tripe the best I've had in the city - including those in Markham & Richmond Hill); some of the rice and chow mein dishes (e.g. Satay Beef & Shrimp w/eggplant) are saucy and well-seasoned. Main courses lack sophistication and finesse (vegetables are poorly chopped or over-blanched).   Late-night diners: ALWAYS double-check your bill. Greasy, slick-hair manager who runs the cash likes to overcharge unsuspecting customers not familiar with prices on the menu. I've been burned before."}
{"text":"Good but oily kinda salty but i recommend their black bean sauce shrimp lobster, somewhat it is better than regular shrimp and their sause is amazin."}
{"text":"Would definitely not recommend this place found a bug in the food and they still made me pay for the food worst experience for Chinese food I ever had"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place is more Chinese food geared towards Caucasians. D and I was running around doing errands in China Town and decided to give this place a try. We ordered a congee, a stir fry beef noodle, Chinese broccoli and deep fried Chinese donut to go with our congee. The congee was really thick - good flavor but really thick. The noodle dish wasn't every good - the soya base sauce was not evenly distributed with the noodle and the flavor just wasn't really there. Overall, I definitely had better Chinese food and the food we ordered are pretty basic of any Chinese restaurants, especially in the area."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, but no matter how much food you might order as your main dish, get the dumplings."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for several years even after moving out of town and then back home. Somehow the main guy that is responsible for the register seems to remember us or maybe he is just that polite. Anywho, the restaurant is no fine dinning but who goes for the look when your real intention is to eat! I always get the corn with chicken on rice and substitute the chicken for shrimp and make it fried rice. Probably the only dish I find that actually has a good balance of salt and that I could eat on its own. I'd also recommend the small dish of steam vegetables with oyster sauce on the side. Would highly recommend this place either after partying or just to simply grab some good food."}
{"text":"My first 5 star rating, and with good reason. Easily the best hot and sour soup I have ever had. They know my face, how much I love their food, and how well I tip (especially when I am drunk) so I get treated like The Godfather (er, Godmother?) when I come here. Beer and soup magically appear at my table within minutes of my entry. The service is amazing and they always give us extra fortune cookies, which we shamelessly wolf down seconds after they hit the table. I am faithfully devoted to this restaurant out of the zillions of Chinatown due to the quality of food, the service, and the fair prices."}
{"text":"Let's call this place a \"hole in the wall\" in Chinatown but not a bad way.   \"Old school\" noodle house but also offers many of the sweet and sour, egg rolls and fried rice/noodle \"Caucasian\" specials.  Service is not bad since everyone was polite and efficient but this is certainly not your \"high class\" place.  Tea, plates, chopsticks were just tossed in the middle of the table-no biggie since that is what's expected.  And the staff does speak decent English (you will not feel uncomfortable if you cannot speak Chinese).  This place was quite busy late at night and open til the wee morning hours with a flow of takeout and eat in customers.   The customer mix: business people, students, gangsta-look, clubbing people, dating couple.....Basically just anyone looking for a decent meal late at night (cannot comment on daytime customers since I have never been here any earlier than 1030pm).  Now onto the food.  The noodles in soup was not full of MSG that required lots to tea.   The vegetables and fries noodles did not have layers of oil to make it tasty.  Must try place!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Swatow for when we were visiting Toronto. Stopped in for lunch and it was exactly as my friend said - delicious and authentic, quick and relatively cheap. The shrimp dumpling soup was great but the fried pork dumplings really stole the show. I'm still thinking about them. We also had Shanghai noodles which were decent. I'd go back again in a second if I was in Chinatown, but I'd get two orders of dumplings!"}
{"text":"I studied the Yelp reviews all up and down Spadina, intent on finding the best possible Chinese meal. I'm from NYC and used to homecooked Chinese--with high standards. Swatow had some of the highest Yelp reviews, so I diligently made a list of recommended dishes (beef with broccoli, shrimp dumplings, wonton soup). Well, the prognosis is that maybe my standards for what good Chinese food is is different than Torontonians. The beef was stringy (tasted slightly fake); the broccoli fine but lazily cut (uncut) into tree limb-size stalks; the wonton soup was perfectly bland. Also, the managers here were gruff and unpleasant, shouting at me and hastening me to leave. All in all not a great experience; would not recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Okay, I love this place..yeah, the decor isn't great, but the food is delicious.  I'm certainly not giving it 4-stars because of the decor or the ambiance, because there really isn't any.    The food is consistently delcious, the service is fast even though the place is always busy.  I love the General Tao Chicken, the deep fried shrimp wontons, the beef with crispy noodles, ANY of their eggplant dishes!    Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I came here twice with my boyfriend, once to get congee to go and the other time to eat soup noodles. It's another one of those non fuss asian restaurants that serves a typical cantonese fair.   Standouts are the beef tendon noodles (soup is really flavourful) and the wonton noodle soup. The preserved egg and pork congee was not my favourite: they barely chop up the egg resulting in huge chunks of egg in the congee and the pork is some type of thick floss which I found weird?  Overall, the type of place when you need food fast and cheap."}
{"text":"Best real Chinese restaurant in Toronto. Legit Asian food for a good prices. Been going here since I was a kid - anytime I miss home cooking I stop by here."}
{"text":"Cantonese cooking at its best! Everything cooked perfectly and comes out scalding hot which is the way it should be. Lots of regulars who comes here! Food taste great just like in Hong Kong. When in Toronto, one should come for a few stops. Recommend the clams with black bean sauce, the hollow vegetables, and the beef stew cooked with turnips. I'm hungry just in writing this review..."}
{"text":"This place only barely passes because you're never hear unless you're hungover or drunk. This is old-school quick and dirty Chinese food. Most of dishes are greasy and come out hot. I still love it whenever I need that fix but please people...this is by no means \"good\" Chinese food."}
{"text":"It was fine overall. Black bean chicken with noodles - quite oily and not quite as much black bean sauce flavor as I expected.  Hot and sour soup was more sour (and orange) than any other I've had.  Vegetable fried rice - was fine. Just tastes like rice with vegetables.Would be nice to have a little more egg in it."}
{"text":"Following a recommendation I came here to have beef tendon noodle soup. Well actually I chose the Swatow special, which has a little bit of everything including the beef tendon. The soup was flavourful and all the bits were yummy, only the beef tendon was a little chewy and could have done with longer cooking. Though it was only 11am, so I assume after keeping the tendon in hot stock all day it will be uncious as anything. But hey ho, it was still yummy. I did however notice that a few people had ho fun noodles in their soups, so I'm guessing that is the one to have here. My wonton soup style noodles were also nice though."}
{"text":"this is really a 3.5 Was in Kensington so headed to Swatow for some grub...as usual the place is packed.  We split the combo b meal (Hot and Sour soup ..... excellent combination of spice and sour very nice but a bit too much carrots in it for my liking; Sezchwan Shrimp (perfect); and Noodles (noodles came in a Sezchwan sauce also); we ordered an extra spring roll (they were fresh made and hot - but not the best nor the worst I have tasted).  Not bad - consistent as usual..there are better places in China Town but this is still good (its a little pricier than some of the other places in China Town...due to being popular and \"well known\")"}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I have to say the food there's horrible  I had the noodles soup there for lunch and that's just so bad. The soup is apparently just water with some soy sauce... And the noodles wasn't even soft...  The service was ok but the environment wasn't good neither. A little bit to nosey."}
{"text":"Visited Swatow for my first time ever.  Really liked my meal here.  Certainly very much a cut above the restaurants that I have experienced close to my home turf of Gerrard and Broadview.  Well worth the diversion. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, Swatow is a cramped Chinese restaurant that delivers on tasty, large portioned, cheap food.   I went here today with my Chinese relatives who were smacking their lips and saying how fresh and delicious everything was (and had been since the 1970s when they went here as university students themselves), so + 1 for authenticity.   Expect to be well fed with a still-happy wallet. Menu is in both Chinese and English.   Between four of us, we ordered: - Two orders of fish ball soup with different types of noodles - Deep fried tofu and fried with bamboo shoots served in a sizzling clay pot (delicious!) - Beef on crispy noodle with vegetable - Yu choy with oyster sauce  Tips: - Expect a 5-10 minute wait at busy times. - Flag down someone to place your order as they are sometimes harried and understaffed. - Try the ridiculously amazing spicy chili oil (found on every table) liberally in your soup - Don't stay for the bathrooms (I've seen far worse in Chinatown, but these ones are just cramped and damp) - If you see something others have that you want, just point at it and ask the waiter for it (we did that, and it was our favourite dish)"}
{"text":"Here I was trekking on my old \"hood\" on a nice Sunday afternoon and showing my 9 year son where I grew up and it's lunch time and we are both hungry. This seemed like the perfect hole in the wall. There was a line up and communal tables - always a good sign.  Interesting thing despite my liking to this place ironically was for different reasons then most of glowing reviews on here. For instance it was as not cheap as I first thought. They didn't bring the food right away, which is actually a good sign... people any place that brings the food with in the first 5 minutes means it is doubtful it was made to order.  We start off with the chicken with noodles and veggies. Tip if you  have kids... always order noodles you can't go wrong ))) It was good and my son loved sharing a table with other people as we chatted... only wish more places in TO would adopt this. Next came a near perfect beef with cashews. I would say it took a good 20 minutes for dish to come out and it was well worth the wait. The tender beef melted in our month like butter with the crispy cashews a good add on for texture. The sauce was a very different, not overly spicy but not bland either. I think this dish was about $14 not cheap for a place like this but well worth it. I will be back !"}
{"text":"A lot of reviewers recommended the shrimp wonton soup, but it was average. The wontons were small & limp from the lack of shrimp, the veges were simply blanched, and the broth was just your regular old chicken stock. Not sure what the rave is, but at least the noodles were cooked al-dente and there were lots of it."}
{"text":"Great food but the place is a bit small and not really clean. i mean there were some bubble in our water lol (i think it was the soap). They only take cash."}
{"text":"4/5  My friend took me here for take out and oh my.. I was quite surprised! Loved my shrimp lobster sauce rice and beef rice noodle. Love the energy of the owner and fast service! I only have 4 because of they overdose me with msg...  Still a good food tho..  Well definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Introducing me to Swatow was one of the best things an ex-bf has ever done for me. I've been frequenting Swatow for over 15 years and it's never let me down. It's basic and to-the-point Chinese food with no nonsense service. It's oftentimes busy so don't be alarmed if you're asked to share a table. I'd rather share than wait.   Get the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup, Stuffed Tofu, Stuffed Eggplant and the General Tso's Chicken.   They don't take Debit or Credit here so make sure to bring cash. Also, don't be surprised if you see Susur Lee here late at night. He comes here often and he always gets the noodle soups."}
{"text":"We went to Swatow twice during our stay in Toronto! Small Chinese restaurant, this place offers so much. I certainly recommend. If you like noodles, don't hesitate to order a noodle soup. Yummy! They use fresh noodle pasta they make in the kitchen. Very very good.   Their soups are good, fried noodle meals are delicious. You must plan a 10-15 minutes wait before you are assigned a table, but it is definitely worth it. The decor is regular Chinese restaurant decor, but the food... Very good ."}
{"text":"We had late night cravings and decided on Swatow. It was a good choice. The food was good, service was fast and prices were excellent. I give it a four because the restaurant itself is not too nice but this is China town."}
{"text":"So good. The Cantonese chow mein was so good. The noodles were fired perfectly and the pork on top was amazing. The chicken wings were no fail. Finally, the General tso was equally amazing. Lots of Hugh quality chicken and crisp green peppers. A lot of food for two, roughly $50. Will be back! More expensive meal than most places but you're paying for quality."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese restaurant in all of Toronto.  Good service, decent price, super fast cooking and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"This place was interesting. It deserves 5 starts solely for the incredible food. Hole in a wall is an overrating, but to give them extra credit, it was a very clean restaurant. We freaked out a little when we first saw the interior of the restaurant, but we decided to give it a try, and after eating the food, we were so glad we did. The staff is not the typical serving staff we are used to, but we didn't care much, because the amazing food compensated for the rest of the flaws. The somewhat abrupt waiter approached us 3 times in less than 5 minutes asking if we were ready to order and didn't offer to serve drinks until we inquired and ordered ourselves. We hurried and ordered the food, which was served surprisingly fast. The vegetable noodles were beyond amazing, the dumplings were equally great, and the rest of the dishes were full of taste and aroma. The best part was getting the check, which was written I presume in Chinese. The only thing I recognized on the bill was the amount, but because the food was so good, I didn't mind that either. I just wish we had time to eat there one more time before leaving Toronto."}
{"text":"After what felt like a series of bad Chinatown restaurant after bad Chinatown restaurant. This was a great surprise. The reviews are good for a reason. The service and staff quick and easy going. A lot of times in Chinatown the staff is really unfriendly, pushy. The wonton noodle soup with BBQ pork was excellent."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place a chance but it really failed me. I found a bug in my hot and sour soup. Obviously sent it back, and I was so turned off that I didn't even want a new one. We also had spring rolls and vegetables. Spring rolls were way too oily and the vegetables were okay. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I come here for one reason. The Cantonese Chow mein. For the most part, everything is pretty decent, but when I need that crunchy noodle chow mein fix, swatow is my go to."}
{"text":"We ordered the special combo B. The egg drop soup was good. Eggroll was mediocre. The shrimp was horrible! It was not fully cooked and mushy. Then we told the waitress and she literally said she'd recook it... Not even making it new. AND for the two pieces of shrimp we didnt eat they were too cheap to replace it. The special noodles were slightly above average. In summary I dont think this restaurant is special or anything."}
{"text":"We wanted to try some authentic Chinese food which this place was highly rated on Yelp. **BUT it was a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!**  Came here on a weekday night at 7pm. The place was less than half full.   They give you a menu, a order paper and a pencil so you can write down which ever dish number you want.  We ordered the Jeje chicken, fish fillet on rice and clams in black bean sauce. The dishes came quickly after we order, guessing since there's not much customers in the restaurant.   The clams in black bean sauce were just average, the clams were just cooked in black bean sauce, sauce are ones which you buy in the glass containers at grocery stores, can't really go wrong with that.  The fish fillet was frozen fish on a bed of rice with a few veggies. Tasted just okay.  The Jeje chicken came in a stone pot. The wings were CHOPPED UP PIECES OF CHICKEN WINGS! So each piece was tiny, even though there seemed to be a lot of pieces, after you puzzle them back together, there might only be 6/7 chicken wings. This is only the tip of wings and middle section, so basically not much chicken meat! The chicken was fried then tossed in sauce and put in a hot stone pot with some Asian veggies to be cooked. This is the most UNAUTHENTIC dish I've eaten. There should be other Asian cured meat that was suppose to be in this dish.  Prices were average just like any other Chinese restaurants.  ** Would NEVER recommend of come back again. Also, service wasn't the greatest as all Chinese restaurants are the same."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have a nice noddle dumpling soup in a very cold day. Waiters are kind nd very friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  They are quick and the food is tasty.  Beef tenderloin on rice is awesome."}
{"text":"I went to Swatow for one purpose: shrimp dumplings. I ordered the shrimp dumpling soup (~$7) and watched a man make wontons at an impressive rate while we waited. He'd fill them with one hand and fold them with the other hand. (It looked like he was just mashing them with his fist but it was more intricate than that, we just couldn't tell how he did it.) The broth was nice but the dumplings were a bit disappointing. The onion/water chestnuts weren't chopped finely enough for the dumplings that I got a bit of a crunch when I ate each dumpling. The flavor was just OK. I much preferred the shrimp dumplings from House of Gourmet. Too bad!   Their hours according to the man I spoke to: 11:00am-2:00am."}
{"text":"My favourite late night eat! Service is speedy and food arrives within 5 minutes of being seated. The restaurant is always busy but the wait is never too long. You can call ahead for takeout but no delivery. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Close to the best Chinese your going to find in Toronto. Your flavor buds will be well satisfied."}
{"text":"This spot hit the Spot. The service was prompt even though it was very crowded. I had the Special B - so much food I had to share with family; my son had the Duck on Rice-simple & too the point, Bok Choy was a plus; wifey had the General Tso Chicken-huge plate and yes shared. Dishes are made traditional style not US. Check it out if you're in Toronto Chinatown"}
{"text":"I have come here over the years. Very Busy place. Good service. Food is good. Prices are a bit higher than the other neighborhood spots. But I return here because the Shrimp Won Tons and the Chili Oil on the table."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our Chinatown go-to's.  I friggin love their hot and sour soup. It's tomato based, mildly zingy and balanced with some nice sweetness. To turn the soup into a cheap-ass meal, I just dump some steamed rice in there. Huzzah."}
{"text":"If it's swanky decor you're looking for, consider this place the anti-swank. It's a no frills bare bones type of place, with lighting that most closely resembles a hospital corridor. It doesn't matter. Once you taste the food, it won't matter to you either.  First off, this is THE MOST efficient restaurant I've ever eaten at. While that often means cold, robotic service when talking about Chinese restaurants, in this instance I literally mean it's the most on point place I've ever eaten at. One time I went with a group of friends and after the waiter took our orders I said \"It's amazing how fast they make the food here, watch, all of our food will be here within 4-5 minutes\". I believe all of our food was on the table in about 4 minutes and it tasted awesome. I've eaten here more times than I can recall, and the only complaints I'd have is they take cash only and sometimes the prices on the wall are different from the menu (always go with the menu prices). Other than that, it's spot on. The portions are HUGE, the staff know the menu like the back of their hand, and the food always tastes great.  Try: Beef on crispy noodle, Beef Ho Fun, and any of the soups. The spring rolls are good too. Open 'til ridiculously late (5am most days I think)  GO NOW!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Me and my boyfriend often come here to get general Tao chicken, congee, fried sticks and other dishes.   The serving speed is super fast, food are fresh, service is top notch. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm love Swatow. My family and I have been getting food here for years. Usually take-out. On occasion we'll eat in but the atmosphere is \"meh\" and in the winter there's an awful draft.   My favourite is their beef and broccoli chow mein. I don't think it's on the menu, you have to ask for it but they always make it. Just tender beef and yummy crisp canadian broccoli, I could live off it.  Everything else I've eaten there is very good as well, although our family tends to order the same things everytime and don't stray far from the usual. My only complaint is that sometimes the meat is a little on the grisly, fatty or gamey side. But the veg is always fresh."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been out of the city for too long, but I found that Swatow's long hours, quick service, and reasonable prices was a godsend. Great bite to satisfy after-hours hunger and so many options to choose from."}
{"text":"Way back in the late 70s and early 80s, before there was any uptown Chinatowns, I used to go to Chinatown to watch kung fu movies (with subtitles). I've been to many restaurants like this in this.Maybe I've even been here before but it's been so long.  Walking in around 1:00pm on a freezing cold Boxing Day, the place was packed! I shared a table with two other parties. I haven't done that in a while. Their food looked good - beef and broccoli, ma po tofu, beef with tomatoes, and corn soup.  I ordered duck and a side of stuffed tofu. It was served over rice with some Shanghai bok choy. It tasted pretty good and the veggies were cooked perfectly. All the portions I saw being served were quite generous, including mine.  There is nothing fancy about this place or the presentation of the food. It's clean, the service is good, the food is tasty, and it's cheap!"}
{"text":"What region-style of Chinese food is Swatow.  Is it Hakka, Canonese ?????"}
{"text":"This place is great! It was recommended to us by a store worker, and everything about it was amazing. The service is very quick and the servers are kind and helpful, the food is cheap but extremely delicious, and the menu has great variety. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone in Chinatown who is looking for a welcoming environment and some great food."}
{"text":"Full on 4 stars for one of those fill you up Chinese restos. Their food is good and hits the spot, it's always bumping so it doesn't feel like some random Chinese restaurant that no one goes to, they are quick and guaranteed to satisfy a late-night craving! It is not some upscale Asian place, but it's not sketchy... Only downside, no desserts :( ah well, that's not why we go for Chinese anyway!"}
{"text":"Very good food - fast, inexpensive and piping hot!!! Nothing fancy, small hole in the wall but good service and the owners are right there to make sure you are taken care of. Recommended by a friend and I in turn highly recommend Swatow for GREAT food!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best customer service in Chinatown. Food is fast, good and cheap. Love coming here for late night meal/snack. We come here regularly and have brought friends and was never disappointed once. You got to try their stuff bean curd, under a $1 each and so yummy! The best in town! There is one server in particular there that is extra nice. He brings out napkin as soon as we seems to need it and spin the coins when bringing you back the changes!"}
{"text":"Best place in Chinatown for Traditional Chinese wonton noodle soup. Other must try: Hoa fun beef brisket noodles, stir fry clams, fried tofu, fried hot pepper with fish meat.  A very small restaurant with cramp seating, but food arrives in a flash which compensates for the lack of comfort and ambience."}
{"text":"The best Chinese I have ever had!! My family from the US always wants to eat there when they come to Toronto.  It's the freshest tasting"}
{"text":"Came here Thursday evening for dinner.  The food was much better than last time.  Ordered the chicken soup with corn, beef with black bean sauce fried noodle, young chow fried rice and sizzling seafood.  My fave dish was the beef with black bean sauce fried noodle-it was a bit spicy but very delicious."}
{"text":"This place is okay- lots of foreigners so that always makes me question! But anyways- we got the wonton noodles which was kinda gross- the shrimp dumpling noodles is better.... and also got clams in black bean sauce---so yummy and spicy!!! It's not a place i'd run back to... but i think the regular dishes that go with white rice is better than the noodles... don't put too much spicy oil like me! i was literally tearing up!"}
{"text":"Had their special noodles which contained a little bit of everything including their famous swatow style meats. Definitely wasn't a fan of the pork liver (kidney? some type of offal, in cantonese it's pronounced ju yun). However, the noodles were normal, the broth was really good, not sure if it was MSG or not but it was a delicious broth. The assortment of meats was also delicious, my favorite probably being their tendon as there are pieces of meat attached to the tendon. Oh god my mouth waters just thinking about it, also it's very affordable with the noodles being less than 10$ around 8 if i remember,   Definitely would come again, this place fills up quick so you better come earlier or a lot later :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food at affordable prices with fast service sums up this place. Portions are very large, food is fresh and everything is authentic even though they give you fortune cookie at end of meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for dinner and it was super busy. We managed to get a table for five though. This is reminiscent of your classic Chinese restaurants with a million dishes on the menu and specials on the walls in Chinese.   We ordered snails in black bean sauce (I do not like snails even when they're fancy and called escargot), but the sauce was delicious with rice! The general Tsao Chicken was fresh and crispy with a spicy sweet sauce, all the seafood dishes were delicious, including the shrimp, and the fish; EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS (and I definitely wanted to order things from other people's tables). The tofu seafood dish was the only disappointment (although every table seemed to be ordering it, so maybe it was just me who thought so).   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. In Chinese, they offer comment on the 'Wok fragrance' when determining if the food is good or not and this place definitely has it! The portions are large and flavorful. I am still longing for the Malaysian noodles and they do have a super Satay Beef Noodle as well. The restaurant is a typical Chinese restaurant so don't expect anything fancy, but the waitress is nice and friendly. I am going to have to make a special trip to Toronto just for Swatow!"}
{"text":"The place doesn't look anything special from the outside but it was full and a bit of a line up.  It's a hit and miss in terms of the food. We ordered sweet and sour pork which was great and cashew nut chicken which sucked.  They only accept cash so thank God I had enough,usually never carry much cash on me. It's the 21st century. Start accepting cards"}
{"text":"Great Shrimp dumpling noodle soup"}
{"text":"It's good for a quick, abundant servings and inexpensive meal!  Came here on a rainy Wednesday evening for a hot bowl of pork & preserved egg congee and beef stew & wonton soup. The portions and toppings generous. The service is also fast, with waitstaff nearby ready to help.  Don't forget to get a glass of soy milk!"}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food, super-fast (less than 10 mins. for all our dishes to arrive!), and very cheap! I've only been here once, but my DC is a regular here. It was almost full on a Sunday night, which is a good sign. DC told me that on busier nights, they sometimes have a cop outside the door (because they only accept cash, by the end of a busy night they would have tons of cash, putting them at risk of being robbed).   It's your typical Chinatown joint -- no frills, just straight up noodles, fried rice, and congee. We had: - Chicken and mushroom congee - very yummy! Comfort food.  - Fried tofu and vegetables - nice, kinda salty. The tofu was still a bit crispy and not mushy like when it's overdone at some places, or when there is too much sauce.  - Wonton noodles - pretty standard. The wonton are all shrimp (vs. the kind with shrimp with meat, chives).   Total came to $25 with taxes and tip. They also have some \"combo\" meals, which seem to be catering to non-Chinese people (they all come with spring rolls!). They give you fortune cookies with your bill."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack of wonton soup, beef stew and tendons, and a soy milk. Wow, did that hit the mother land spot!   Place is clean and run by a bunch of pros who are serious about their Chinese BBQ."}
{"text":"This is our comfort food haven. The chow mein is really good. The restaurant itself is small and can get very busy but the food is quick and good."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Hor Fun Beef Stew Soup Noodles in Toronto.  Just like the ones back in Asia.  That's just about the only dish I order when I come here.  Sometimes I would order their fish paste peppers, which is also done traditionally well.   The food taste fresh and is reasonably priced here.  Every single time I eat here, it makes me feel like I am back home.   Too bad it's so far from where I live or else I'll frequent this place more often if I could."}
{"text":"Swatow-thank you for coming to my rescue.  I've been searching for good chinese food since moving to Toronto 6 months ago;alas, I've found it!  Shrimp wanton soup is a must with every visit! I look forward to my next visit and to selecting some new treats from your rather extensive menu."}
{"text":"My Chinatown fav.   Been coming here for close to 2 decades so long overdue review.   There is a reason a restaurant can last as long as swatow has. Their food is pretty topnotch. They are reasonably priced, taste and portion is great and they are open late.   My go to dishes are, Cantonese chowmein (best in chinatown)  beef stew on rice, wonton noodle soup, and any of their fried rice (extra greasy=extra delicious) lastly their oyster in blackbean sauce on steam rice! Soo good.   One negative is that it's quite tightly packed meaning not stroller friendly only reason they get 4 instead of 5. He'll I would of given them 4.5if there was an option to"}
{"text":"The other reviews are accurate. The waiters do toss the menu onto the table and roughly brings you a stack of plates and silverware. But were you expecting something different from a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant?? I wasn't. Hahaha.   The food was surprisingly good. And most importantly none of the dishes were greasy or overly salty.  I ordered a fried rice, a wonton noodle, and a stirred fried veggie. No layer of oil at the bottom of the dish and I didn't feel the need to constantly drink tea.  The fried rice was full of seafood and other ingredients. Many restaurants would skim on these ingredients but this place didn't.  The flavors are very traditional and I can taste the fried eggs in the fried rice. They did a great job!!  If you are craving a late night snack or waiting to sober up before heading home, this place will give you some satisfying food. I suspect they will have a line. I was here around 10:45pm and it was a full house with a few people waiting for to-go orders."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the downtown T.O. chinatown, and its quality hasn't gone down over the past decade. The kong xin cai and beef chow fun make a good late night snack. If you only have USD, the owner will quote you a fair exchange rate."}
{"text":"High quality food. Pretty good prices for the location. The service is average. Only problem is that the location only accepts cash. And they ask for tip which is not very nice."}
{"text":"I have dreams about their deep fried dumplings sometimes. This place is a gem. Love their salted fish and diced chicken fried rice and their roasted duck with special sauce is delicious! Don't come here if you want fine dining, but if you want some bomb Chinese food, this is definitely a spot to hit up and try!"}
{"text":"Price are pretty expensive but the food are great and nice staff... Good place to eat at late night"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert connoisseur of Chinese food but this place seemed better than most of the others I've been to. The service is lightning-fast and the food was fresh and tasty. I went with a friend but we had more than enough; the portions are quite generous. Maybe I'm out of touch because I prefer these \"classic\" dishes to some of the \"Asian fusion\" fare I've had, but it's kind of refreshing to go somewhere that serves simple, consistently good food without the need to innovate.  I'm not sure if they serve Chinese mixed veg in their dishes but I got regular broccoli in the Cantonese noodles I ordered; maybe I'll ask for Chinese broccoli next time. My friend and I both noticed the lighting here is exceptionally bright, but we didn't go for romantic ambiance - just  great food!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place for late night Chinese food, Canton Style noodles, rice, and stir-fry.  Price is about $10pp, been here many times but never during the day. Good for small groups of people.  4 stars simply because the place is always filled with customers (Asian and all sorts of ethic groups), many years running, well staffed both in the front and kitchen, open till super late, seems like this business will always be around forever! Props to the owner!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has tasty food.  The menu is a standard sampling of dishes for a Chinese restaurant in North America.  I tried several of the basics including sweet and sour pork, General Tso's chicken, a dish with scallops and broccoli, and a crispy noodle dish with mixed seafood.  Even though the restaurant was full when we ordered, our food came out quickly.  All the dishes were very well seasoned and I thought the vegetables were fresh and tasty.  The General Tso's chicken was my favorite even though I thought the chicken could have been chopped into smaller pieces.  The scallops were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Swatow is a staple of Chinatown, the food portions are huge, and some of the best general tso in the city. Can be a bit tight, and service isnt the greatest, but thats Chinatown. Usually very busy, but moves quick. Wonton soup is king here too."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, and tasty. I wouldn't come here if I were concerned with my diet or if I wanted to know if my meat was farm raised, but I can't argue with the fact it's tasty.   Similar to a lot of these Chinatown dives, this restaurant has a thin layer of history covering the whole place... It's not the classy joint you'd take a girl on a first date, but it's a comfortable place you'd take her on the fifth.   It's a restaurant that will obviously not go anywhere anytime soon. 3 stars because it's nothing amazing and the ambience is not that great"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. I always get crunchy chow mein at every new Chinese restaurant I go to and this was delicious. The servings are huge and at a great price. Service was quick and everything was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20yrs usually for late night chow. Everything I've ever tried has been good. Now I have had better Chinese food but not better value."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago and omg very, very Yummy food, we had the noodles and tofu (we substituted beef for tofu). Friendly service and very generous portions! The three of us could easily share one dish! Very delicious and affordable!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried the wonton and stuffed toufu. Tasty and delicious. It's my hometown flavor.  And the staffs are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Food is better then average but costs is also more then average. This place is a dive and very small with limited seating. Service is quick and what you would expect from typical Chinese restaurants. There are waits during peak dinner hours so be prepared. Also no private lot so you have to find your own parking. I pretty much enjoyed everything I ate but no wow either. With so much to choose from around the area it's hard to rate this place more then a 3star."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the food based on previous Yelp reviews, and I walked in with low expectations on decor and service. I can't remember ever being treated so rudely in a restaurant. The menus were forcefully thrown on the table by a disgruntled employee who quickly walked away. After noticing that it was cash only, I was directed to the ATM which didn't work. An employee then told me to go down the street to the bank in the most dismissive and disrespectful tone you could imagine. I walked out and didn't return. Maybe the food is good, but the place is a dump and the staff can go to hell."}
{"text":"Downtown Chinese food is to Uptown Chinese food what Uptown sushi to Downtown sushi -- they are ... noticeably different.  If I may use personification, Uptown Chinese is like Alec Baldwin while its Downtown counterpart is more like Stephen Baldwin; they come from the same womb, but one is an acclaimed actor and the other one was once on Big Brother UK.  Not to say that one is worse off than the other, but at the very kindest way of putting things, they have different standards for themselves.  Now we come back to Swatow where I ordered a bowl of brisket and wonton rice noodle soup with extra beef balls.  I wasn't impressed but this is definitely one of the better Chinese food experiences I've had downtown.  So should I be grateful and feel more enjoyable because this is basically what I have to work with since moving down here?  Or should I still hold onto my old standards at the risk of sounding like an overly-critical Debby Downer?  *sigh* I don't even know anymore.  Let's start with the positives.  All the ingredients were fresh.  The shrimp filling in the wontons had the naturally sweet shrimp taste without the off putting fishy taste of stale seafood.  The beef balls had a crisp texture and were also quite beefy (for a lack of a better description).  The brisket was cooked perfectly, they were not stringy and dry at all.  There was a good amount of vegetables in the bowl.  The broth was light and refreshing; they use a kind of Chiu Chow preserved vegetable to add a naturally savoury taste to it.  I learned from a Cantonese friend to add a little dash of vinegar when I order a brisket noodle soup because it cut's the fattiness of the meat and brings out the flavour of the beef itself.  Apart from the food, the restaurant looked clean the the patrons there were not sketchy.  Onto to what I didn't like about this place.  The wontons had very little filling to what I'm used to and the beef balls were also very small.  Even though the filling was good, the wontons were not satisfying because every bite had too much wrapper.  The slow cooked chunks of brisket were too sweet for me -- they were almost on the verge of tasting like liquorice candy.  The broth-to-noodle ratio was too low for my liking and at the end I was left with a heap of dry and tasteless noodles.  All in all, I was simply underwhelmed.  It's especially disappointing when there are many good attributes about this place but they just don't stack up.  However, I must point out that the price here is good even by Chinatown standards.  Swatow isn't bad but, with all the good food downtown, I would save my Chinese food cravings till when I get the chance to go back up north."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone downhill but not the price. Ordered Salt Fish and Diced Chicken Fried Rice - no salt fish at all. How can they cheap out on the most important ingredient?!?!? Not many customers during the height of dinner time on a Saturday...  not surpised at all."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: a really crowded and small space, all tables and chairs feel very jammed, not claustrophobia friendly... and expect a line up during busy time  Service: I mean... it's a typical Chinese restaurant with Chinese restaurant style service, can't expect nor ask much, but no complain  Food: came here for dinner, and ordered some Steamed Veggies with Oyster Sauce, Sweet and Sour Pork, Satay Beef Fried Rice Noodles, and Snails with Black Bean Sauce. Can't say about the authenticity since I'm not used to eating Canton style Chinese foods as I'm more used to North- Western style Chinese food, but everything tasted just good to me, can't say great nor amazing on any dish.  Overall: a great spot if you are looking for the typical and popular known Chinese dishes, but not something I'd specifically go back and line up for."}
{"text":"Great food, I am Chinese and love love wonton egg noodle soup and fish ball rice noodle soup. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got so many excellent reviews on Yelp *argh* To me, this place is nothing more than a regular small local Chinese restaurant open late hours that does foods just up to par; nothing special or impressive at all.  The congee was bland and an extra pinch of salt was needed.  The fried flat rice noodles with beef was A-Okay; the noodles itself was thinner/ slimmer in width and in thickness than usual, which I had found interesting....yea yea yea...Call me weird or whatever.  Anyhoo, this place was overhyped, and I was a little disappointed as my expectation was not quite met."}
{"text":"This is an update on my previous reviews.  I've been eating here for the past 5 or more years. I usually order the rice meals and have give  them a 5 star...till now. For the past couple of time I have related here recently I have noticed a lot of negative qualities.  Like I said I have usually ordered the rice meals but these last few times have not been great. The taste is not the same (have a feeling they changed the brand of l sauce they have been using to cook certain dishes), The amount is 1/4 smaller, and the prices are higher. I usually eat the same thing around 90% of the time so I am able to taste the difference.  I actually wonder if this is just for the rice meals or for other items as well. Anyway when I decide to go back I might try something else and will re update."}
{"text":"Do not go there if your group or you are drunk. They will sneak an extra item or two onto your bill just because they think you're unconscious so they can take advantage of that.   Horrible service. No manner. Not respectful. The Cashier person especially is the worst person.  Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"After a long night of partying, my stomach is growling and I know I have to feed it before I get hangry. So I find myself at Swatows once again in the wee hours.  I keep coming back here not because I enjoy sitting in a cramped restaurant or eating the same food that hasn't changed for the past 20 years...It's simply because the food is good, it's cheap and the service is super efficient.  Your food is put on the table before you even finish giving your order! It's like magic!  There is always plenty of servers to make sure you have everything you need and the tables are turned for the next guest.    Notable mentions are Black pepper beef with rice and shrimp dumpling soup."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Swatow, but didn't get around to giving it a chance until quite recently. The location and decor are convincingly traditional. The space is long and crowded with small booths and tables. When we walked through the long room to get to our table in the back, the assorted dishes laid out in front of other diners looked pretty decent.   Since the prices are so extremely cheap, I guess it's not that surprising that the food is only alright. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible. It's just not as fantastic as I had expected it to be.   My lunch date and I started our meals off with an appetizer each - one a wedge of green pepper and the other deep fried tofu each stuffed with fish paste and doused in sweet soy sauce. These were not bad tasting, but suspiciously only lukewarm on the tongue.  I found the wontons rather small and shockingly lacking in pork content. My mixed noodles arrived on a humongous platter topped with punchy scallions and a side of unbearably salty broth. My lunch date's go-to \"sui gow\" with noodles were a much better choice comparatively.  The service is rather hurried, yet efficient as expected in Chinatown. For both food and ambiance, I still prefer King's Noodle."}
{"text":"There is only one thing I order from Swatow and that's the Shrimp Dumpling Soup - without noodles, so there is more room for those delicious dumplings!  Everything else I have had here was disappointing - especially the General Tso chicken, so tough, too sweet and filled with raw green peppers.  The best thing about Swatow is the crazy late hours, but beware on weekends - it's crazy busy after the bars close."}
{"text":"Fantastic... My friends and I stumbled upon this gem on Canada day and couldn't have been more satisfied.  We ordered the following... -shrimp dumpling soup -bbq pork friend rice -general tso chicken  -beef dish with green peppers and onions served over crispy lo mein noodles. We saw a table with this dish and asked the server the name of the dish... He said \"it's not on the menus\"... So we had to try it ourselves and we were more than pleased.  Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone living or visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and there was literally a fight that broke out in the line for the food. It is so good! The noodles are amazing. Great place to go after a long night of partying"}
{"text":"This place lived up to all the hype. The food was delicious, it came out fast, and service was on point. It reminded me a lot of the Chinese (American) restaurants I used to go to growing up. Not really the place if you are looking for Hong Kong (cha chaan tang), but really legit Chinese stir fries, and classic dishes over rice, etc. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"best chinese restaurant!! I've been going here in thr last 2 yrs and they haven't disappointed me. my favourite is their fukkin fried rice. not only is the food delicious it's also affordable. the downsize to here is that if you come here after a night out, be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"Swatow is a very good Chinese restaurant located in Chinatown. They don't do anything new or spectacular and if you are not familiar with the area you will probably walk pass Swatow not knowing that you just passed by one of the city's most reputable Chinese eateries. I'm not lying, anyone I know who goes to Chinatown, knows Swatow. They might not eat there or they may even hate this place but they know about this place.   I have been going to Swatow ever since I was a little kid because my dad is a friend of the owner. The always relaxed owner can be seen many nights in his restaurant talking with customers and even serving dishes. When I was little I always felt special my dad knew the owner but when I grew I found out that almost every regular here knows the owner. I believe his name is Peter and the guy sure is a character.   The restaurant itself is one of those shady looking dive restaurants. The place is tiny, crowded, and the tables and chairs must be older than Chinatown itself. I have to admit that I love the atmosphere here because it is something that hasn't changed in ages.   The food here is its selling point. It is really good and non-pretentious. It comes to your table quick and fresh. My favourite things here include the seafood chow mein and the beef brisket on rice.  The chow mein noodles are crunchy until they soak up all the sauce. It is crammed with seafood toppings and veggies. The beef brisket is covered in a wonderful sauce and it's piled on a bed of rice. Both are served in large portions and are very filling so it's nice to share with a friend.   I do have to agree with other people here when they say that they come here only when they are drunk. I have noticed me coming here after a night of drinking more often than coming here during the day. That's not a downside though because that just means this place is open late and can understand the slurs coming out of a drunk party goer.   Swatow is great. The food is great. The owner is great. The business hours are great. Yup, if you are new to the area and walk pass this place thinking its just another Chinese restaurant, you just foolishly passed by one of Toronto's great eateries."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese food in Toronto - it is so good without the need to get drunk to say it is a so good as it is very good :-)   Recommended dishes:  1. Sweet and sour chicken  2. Assorted fried noodle  3. Salted fish and chicken fried rice 4. Fired tofu with fish and shrimp"}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday, but wait was only about 5 minutes.  If you're one of those people that likes a quick in and out type of vibe, this restaurant is the one.  Overall, the food was great and I was especially impressed with the deep fried bean curds ($1 each).  Price was very reasonable for the relatively large portion.   Definitely would go back to try their other fried noodles."}
{"text":"Go with as many people as you can so you can try as many dishes as you can! Portions are decent sizes."}
{"text":"been going here since time. good food and friendly service. opens late too"}
{"text":"Food is good, fast and fresh, place is small. You write your own order, overall great first experience in authentic Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"If you give this place anything less than 4 stars its because you don't know what to order. One of my favourite late night spots that's authentic and always satisfying.   My recommendations are; shrimp with lobster sauce on rice (with or without rice, up to you), stuffed long green pepper, clams with black bean sauce, salt and hot pepper fried seafood or shrimp, beef vegetable on rice and their general tao is pretty damn good.  The service is fast and friendly and if you complain about the service here its probably because you're the jack ass."}
{"text":"Been going there for the past 16 years. Swatow quality never fails. Choose any dish with confidence!"}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese food ( I am a Chinese Cantonese , so can tell real / fake Chinese style ) Reasonable price , clean , service was quick too. Nothing much to complain  Ordered  *Wonton noodle 10/10 *Deep fried pig intestines 9/10 *Black bean beef rice 9/10 *Beef brisket and tendon 9/10 *2 fried tofu 10/10"}
{"text":"2.9  I am not a fan.   Yee Mein (noodles), as shown in the restaurant's front, is just disappointing, bland and watery-MSG-boosted. Chose one of their regular vermicelli soups.  Otherwise, food is ok, but just regular, no more. Staff is OK and attentive."}
{"text":"Really don't know how this place has 4 stars.. Not impressed at all. I had chicken fried sweet and sour chicken with chicken chow mein.. it was pretty bad. Maybe the pho is what keeps people coming back. I'm really shocked at the fact that this place was soooo busy when I went on a Thursday afternoon."}
{"text":"Great food and selections, fast and good service. Would be great if they put less salt in their food, I can hardly taste anything beyond the first few bites."}
{"text":"This place serves my favourite dish done right!  A simple shrimp and scrambled egg with rice noodles (#68).  It's so simple but can't be done at home (at least not mine).  The key is the fried rice noodle which is done in a hot wok with oil so hot and a wrist that can flip the noodles so it doesn't burn but give it a nice char.  Plummy shrimps and lightly salted fried egg is thrown in with a pinch of peas and green onion to give it some visual appeal... So good!  The Cantonese noodles here are great too but I can't help but lean toward my favourite.  I always order the egg drop and fish maw soup (#58) with my meal and honestly this is good for at least 2-3 meals for me!  I don't share   It is a small shop with maybe 15 tables, there is one communal table at the front to share with other guests (HK style).  Too bad they don't do an HK tea but then again they are a Guangdong resto not HK."}
{"text":"Swatwo is my favorite Chinese Noodle Restaurant! Not only it's cheap, it's also DELICIOUS! It keeps the traditional Chinese ingredients and soup base.   If it's your first time eating Chinese noodles, order Fish Ball Noodles, that's the safest option and it's still delicious  For yelper who are looking for adventurous options, try the Beef organ noodles, that's my favorite and it doesn't have those stinky organ smell and after taste. Little tip: add a few drops of chilli paste/ oil, it can enhance the flavor of the noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Swatow Restaurant is a cozy, no-frills traditional Chinese restaurant north of Dundas and Spadina. Bottom line: come here for 4 star food. Prices are cheap, service is quick, and portions are huge. I'd say almost anything on their menu is good but I had the Wonton soup and crab/corn soup. Both were delicious and the portions were huge; wasn't expecting this and had to eat both because they were so yummy. Perfect venue for hot noodle soup on a cold winter day.  Pro tip 1: Cozy venue for groups of up to 8.  Pro tip 2: Ordering the wonton soup is enough for 1 person; the portions for each meal are humungous so save your money for beer later."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. Packed and small restaurant. Eat fast as the next guest is already waiting."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto.  Last time we were here, it seemed like you couldn't do wrong with Chinese restaurants.  All were great.  So this one, which isn't bad, was a disappointment.  Nothing special here.  Just an average place - solid 3*."}
{"text":"Bland and uninspired. I had the salted fish & diced chicken fried rice and the fish and tofu hot pot, and both were very disappointing. Rol San makes a MUCH better salted fish & diced chicken fried rice (though still not authentic/up to snuff)."}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the good reviews, and trust me, they're right.  Great, extensive menu, excellent food, nice big portions.  It is cash only, and a completely plain looking place, but in my experience those are the best.  Service was succinct, but never rude, the food came fast.  I had the fish and tofu hotpot, of which I have included a photo.  The hot and sour soup was very different than what I've had before, but it was very good as well."}
{"text":"The prices are average. The staff are a little brash and it is very noisy. But the food is cooked with quality. I have tried the Satay beef rice, curry beef rice and the beef and vegetable rice. Those dishes are amazing!!  Wouldn't recommend the noodle soups. Their specialities are the rice dishes and fried noodles. Bring cash as they only accept that!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a late night spot. Massive portions and the guys who work there are hilarious. Always a fun and interesting crowd."}
{"text":"Years ago, when visiting Toronto, we always stopped in Lee Garden for our Chinese fix.  With our old standby having closed, we needed a new spot, and with the high praise Swatow has received on Yelp, we wanted to give it a try.  It was ... fine.  The staff was rude, but that's not uncommon.  The food was okay.  When I see 'General Tso's Chicken' on the menu, I question the authenticity of the menu, though I realize people do like this non-Chinese dish.  We had four entrees and two non-alcoholic drinks, and I believe the bill was around $90, which was way more than the meal was worth to us.  Next time, we'll try somewhere else.  But again, it was fine."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in ALL of Toronto. The food is always amazing - so good that I always get the same thing, the vegetable fried noodle, it's inexpensive, and I would guarantee that the service here is faster than anywhere else in the city. I'll probably come here at least once a month as long as I live nearby!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for carbs, to carb up for an Ultimate frisbee game later in the day. What better way to get carbs than fried rice? We came here because we heard it was really good, and the reviews didn't disappoint.  The 3 of us were seated immediately. Looking through the menu under fried rice and what do I see? Fuk-kin fried rice. That's right. I was too afraid to try it, though so I ordered the shrimp fried rice ($7.95). The first order comes out and all I see is an enormous plate. Then my order comes out and it's the same size plate. If you're hungry and don't want to pay a lot, this is the place to go. The fried rice was really tasty. I felt bad leaving leftovers, but the size of the dish just defeated me."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for more than 30 years. It has changed  hands over the years but some of the staff remained.  A must visit place."}
{"text":"Cheap and good Chinese food when you are on the go. The sweet and sour chicken is so yummy here. Stay away from the eggrolls they are oily and tastes plain. But overall I would come back again when I have no other choice."}
{"text":"Just finished our meal and it's definitely above average compared to other Chinese noodle restaurants. First off, the service is great. The gentleman up front is nice and he made sure he maximize the table usage so no one waits too long. We had 7 guest. The food was good and priced wised it's pretty fair. The beef stew  noodle soup was a favorite by our guest. I had the scramble eggs with shrimp. It was delicious, much better than New York's version. Upon leaving they were nice to strike up a conversation so it definitely made the experience more welcoming. Will definitely come by again. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to Swatow again last night. This place is the classic Chinatown greasy spoon. When you need a quick bite late at night, this is it. The food is flavourful, it's consistent, and it's cheap. Like most Chinese restaurants, there are plenty of choices. We ordered the shrimp dumpling soup, deep-fried chicken wings, chicken with spicey garlic sauce, yeung chow fried rice, and some sliced (battered) fish on rice. Everything was so good. It's like comfort food.  I especially like the chicken wings. Normally, I like my wings dripping with BBQ sauce but these ones are just deep-fried with no sauce but they're so flavourful!  The service is best described as, well, no-nonsense and efficient LOL.  The Good - good food; like comfort food - very reasonably priced - open late - quick service - good energy level at night for a greasy spoon  The Bad - my friends found the wait staff unfriendly. I didn't they they were unfriendly, but I certainly wouldn't say they were friendly either - I'm not a fan of the bright fluorescent lighting. They should turn it down a notch at night.  Bright lighting aside, I'm definitely a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Remember the last time you had a meal that wasn't too heavy, too light, and that hit the spot?   We came into Swatow restaurant in Chinatown in between lunch and dinner, which is always a great time to sneak in another meal. It's awesome, mainly because it's not too crowded, and I would often get a good sense of the restaurant's vibe when I visited. Most prices here are under $10.   At $4.75, I picked a winner in the beef stew noodle soup (#6). What came next was an appetizing bowl that was topped with generous chunks of well-marinated beef, fresh green vegetables, chopped green onions, all nestling nicely upon a bed of chewy egg noodles.   The broth: deep in flavour, served as a fine accompaniment to the constant in-and-out slurping of the noodle was almost ritual-like. Soup, noodle, meat -- repeat.  Meal momentum is now in motion.   Typically in Chinese restaurants, one knows if the food is good when the sounds of wok and fire can be heard from the kitchen. Evidently enough, it was loud, yet entertaining.  Upon seeing the bottom of the bowl at the end of the meal, I realized that the restaurant was playing hits from today's top charts, and Pompei's \"Bastille\" followed by Rihanna's \"S.O.S.\" which revealed another interesting, modern layer to this cozy, traditional space. A great place for dining alone or with friends, this student-priced around-the-clock restaurant will be my go-to-place from now on.  Notable mentions!  - Shrimp wanton noodles (#9) - Shrimp with Eggplant on Rice (#106 nice for 2 people sharing or just 1 hungry soul)  - Congee with mixed seafood (try ordering the dough fritters along with it, very Hong Kong style) - Fried Tofu (99cents each) - Hot soya milk (this will wash down a meal better than anything else)"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but service was terrible. One of the items I ordered came out to be different than was described because they ran out of the original so they gave me a different one without informing me beforehand. Also, I would like for the waiters/waitresses to ask if I am done with a dish before just yanking it from the table. I wasn't even finished eating and they took my plates.."}
{"text":"It's overwhelming the amount of Chinese food options in Spadina and Swatow is definitely the right choice! They don't take reservations and it's always busy, so you might have to wait outside the restaurant for a table. Also, as I recall they only take cash. Service is fast and attentive. Food is absolutely delicious! Portions are generous so make sure to go with other people so you can try and share different dishes. The BBQ duck was outstanding."}
{"text":"My parents, my aunt, and their friends started coming to Swatow even before I was born. It was always highly spoken of in my family, for their amazing fish balls with rice noodles (???), wontons, fried pig intestine (it's delicious, I promise!), braised beef brisket, and other down-to-earth Cantonese dishes, particularly their noodle soups. However, ever since my family moved to Where the Chinese People Go When They Settle in Toronto (aka Markham/Richmond Hill/Scarborough area), we've only been back very occasionally.  Sometime last year, my mom came here when she was in the area with her friends, and she told me that Swatow wasn't good anymore. I can't remember why, but I filed it in the back of my memory and promptly ignored her opinion when I found myself with some free time last weekend, craving food I had in my childhood.   I ordered fish balls and beef brisket over rice noodle soup, a stuffed tofu, and a plate of Chinese vegetables. And, of course, Mom was right. The food was not what it used to be. I mean, the fish balls were still good - I think they might still be house-made - and the brisket was ok. But the rice noodles were really awful. They broke into tiny pieces whenever I tried to grab mouthfuls when my chopsticks, they were thick (which is the WORST!), and they were all different widths. I don't care if they are wide or narrow, but I do like them to be uniform. And you know how much it cost? $8.75 before tax and gratuities! Which isn't exorbitant, but it's quite a lot for a noodle soup.  The vegetables were ok, but they were very thick and fibrous (\"old\", in Chinese), and most importantly, they weren't cut to be easier to eat. But they weren't too bad.  The stuffed tofu is supposed to be pan-fried, per the Chinese name of the dish, but it was clearly fried. There wasn't much stuffing on it, but it tasted alright. The soy sauce was sweet and not too salty.   I will wait until I'm back north to have something like this again, next time."}
{"text":"I still don't know which plastic-white-table-clothed joint in Chinatown is for me, but I've tried them all a few times, and will continue to taste-test Spadina and Dundas in fair rotation.   Swatow is A-OK and somehow, in my methodical Chinatown rotation, I have managed to avoid it all these years. It's slightly pricier than it's neighbours, but tasty none the less. The helpings are huge (like hayuuuuuuge) so I guess you get what you pay for. Their Singapore noodles are a curried treat, and their fried rice is decent. I wasn't a fan of their hot and sour soup and their General Tsao's is more BBQ than spicy, which isn't how I like it. But I'm a white girl from Nova Scotia, so what do I really know about Chinese food?  I've heard good things about their dim sum, and I'll be back.   PEPPER'S PISSED: If you're sensitive to MSG, be prepared to have your ass kicked after a meal here."}
{"text":"Up'n'coming Chinese food is to Uptown Chinese food.Not to say that that it is super upscale, but it is lightly pricier...however they have mongo servings which for the $/moundoffood ratio minders, is good. Good noodles!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. It's a really great option for a late night meal. We ordered a plate of Cantonese chow mein, sweet and sour pork, shrimp congee, and the shrimp wontons (we really like shrimp).    My favourite has to be the Cantonese chow mein! It was topped with shrimp, squid, bbq pork, brocolli, and carrots but it was the sauce that made this a winner! Super tasty and it made the noodles have the perfect balance of crunchy and soft.   The sweet and sour pork was better than other restaurants but the congee and wontons were pretty standard.   It wasn't that busy in the restaurant so the food came out fast and the service was what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant. If you got the munchies for Chinese food, give Swatow a try."}
{"text":"having lived in the toronto Area for over two decades, this is the Ultimate place for chinese food, with a menu of over 100 dishes, this place is amazing in not only quality, but quality for price...the servings are Massive and i would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. fast service, amazing staff(they don't talk much however) and all meals come with complimentry tea(you have to ask for sugar)  AMAZING amazing place"}
{"text":"Found a piece of plastic wrap in the boiled noodles. Doesn't seem to be quality. The plastic wrap looks like a condom when you pulled it out of the soup. When confronted the manager about it he act as if nothing happened . Just an exchange.  Do you want to exchange after seeing that?"}
{"text":"Service was good, everyone is always kept busy maintaining the restaurant. I ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein, which tasted excellent. Would definitely come again."}
