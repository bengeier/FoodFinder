{"text":"Ordered a banana Nutella whipped cream and a banana Nutella almond crepe. Both were good, with plenty of filling- maybe a but heavy on the almonds in that crepe but it's hard to know how much of each filling someone will want, and I didn't specify the amount. The basic Nutella crepe is $4.95 with an additional $1 for each additional topping/filling; except ice cream which is $2 extra. They have ice cream crepes, hot crepes, and savory crepes; and boba smoothies. I wanted to try the Thai iced tea or lychee flavored boba drinks but at $5.95 each I didn't think it was worth it for me especially with all the calories I was already consuming. Definitely will return when in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Had the lemon and sugar crepe!  It was good!  Friends had a nutella one and the other had a lemon sugar with strawberries and honey.  (So good she ordered a second!)"}
{"text":"I love the creps! I have the strawberry and banana crepes. It was amazing. my friend had a lemon something crep. I love the fact that they overstuff them I paid 695 for my crap and it was delicious and nice feeling little snack dessert. it's located on the third floor in the fashion show mall in the food court the line is not that busy but their crepes are really really good."}
{"text":"I was craving something sweet so my daughter and I opted for a crepe. Now I wasn't expecting anything super exceptional. The crepe was ok and in the end a little too sweet but then again that was my fault because I ordered something with apples, whipped cream, and ice cream. I had to tell the cook to go easy on the ice cream. Customer service was substandard but then again what do I expect? Not many options at the Fashion Show Mall Food Court to choose from any way. Overall not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best crepes that I've had and I think it's a decent price. I always go for the strawberry banana whipped cream and add nutella. The crepe texture is exactly how I like it...not too eggy, not to crispy...a nice light crepe cooked well with a little bit of stretch to encase all of the filling. The strawberries and bananas are always fresh and they never skimp on the fruit, whipped cream or nutella, which is a huge plus in my book.

I was between a 4 and a 5 on this one. My only gripe is that it always takes forever and a half for them to complete my order. But you can place your order for your crepe and order your actual food and come back to find it ready for you to pick up. :) I guess that's the good thing about it being a part of the food court at Fashion Show Mall. Now leave me in peace as I savor what's left of my delicious crepe!"}
{"text":"I was here on the 25th of february, I ordered a Green apple boba/bubble/milk tea with pearls(the bobas) 

Imagine my surprise when i'm given a bright, green drink. That was sickeningly sweet, SOUR and the consistency of a slushie. I was totally shocked.

Anyone who has had an authentic taiwanese/chinese even hongkong style bubble/boba tea drink knows that wasn't what it is. It was almost insulting to say this what they call boba tea in a asian owned establishment, at a high end mall. I sure hope this is not what they consider authentic boba tea. 

I've had it in my hometown many times, in Beijing, in Shanghai, and it's never been given to me in this manner. I would totally remove it from the menu as \"boba\" tea and replace with a very sweet icy slushy.
 

I'm sure no asian who has experience with boba tea would ever even enjoy or think this was the real thing.. i'm not sure who they are trying to fool.. unless you're someone who has never had it before. 

Skip this place for boba tea, and find a GOOD AUTHENTIC, RECOMMENDED PLACE. Seems to be a theme in Vegas for whatever reason (looking at reviews for other places) that they don't make it the authentic, normal way.. and i really don't know why.

The real ones are made with fresh water/milk, milk powder, powdered fruit/real fruit, blended until totally smooth like water, sometimes with or without ice.. and sometimes served warm. 

It is very creamy/milky tasting, and the flavor is strong but mild and not overpowering  (basically it is the flavor that you asked for) and it is usually a LIGHT shade of the kind of fruit or tea you got.  Usually with tons of pearls ( bobas) on the bottom, made from tapioca or without.


It's a really tasty drink when done well, but please do not think this is the real deal.. because you will be disappointed.


The people who work there are friendly and nice, but clearly have no experience or any knowledge on what an authentic boba tea is."}
{"text":"I really shouldn't have expected much, but here is my review anyway.  Coming from SF, where there are creperies everywhere, I guess that I've just been spoiled by good crepes- and Crazy Crepes just didn't cut it.

The crepe was soggy, the fillings were meager, and overall, just \"meh.\"  I had the strawberry custard with chocolate and it did not satisfy my dessert craving.  At just about $6, it's not really a deal either.

Notes:
-They serve milk tea also."}
{"text":"Try the banana chocolate whip , it's soooooooooo goooooood !!! The best brunch I've ever had before !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes they're cheaper than other places on the strip, but it seems like the portions are small. If you order a crepe that comes with whipped cream, ask for the wc on the side, or ask for half the amount. It's overpowering if done otherwise : /"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes.  I asked for the one with lemon butter & sugar but had them add strawberries.  Was so good!!"}
{"text":"Wide variety of crepes, flavor is not good tho, the crepe is very flat. Pretty much flavorless aside from toppings. They don't have complementary sauces like Nutella or caramel, customer service needs some work, I am a local and definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about the Crepe and boba ordered strawberry banana Crepe and mocha boba sad to say both wasn't good..."}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of dessert crepes in the food court of the shopping center.  We ordered the Strawberry-banana custard.  It was large enough to share but small enough to eat alone if you want to indulge.  The batter was good and overall perfectly warm and powdered, drizzled with chocolate sauce.  I really wanted to try the blueberry or strawberry rare cheesecakes ones too...  :-(   If you're shopping or grab a bite in the food court make sure to try out this place."}
{"text":"Een van de betere ' crepe' plaatsten alhoewel de Belgische 1000x beter zijn ;-) ( net zoals de wafels trouwens) maar ik kan zeker niet klagen."}
{"text":"Saw this and was immediately excited to try it!

I told them i didnt exactly see what i wanted on the menu but i would tell them what i wanted and hopefully they could make it for me. I really didnt care how much it cost, just give me the goods baby.

Well, they got the order wrong. I asked for a crepe with banana, nutella, chocolate syrup and extra whip. What did i get? A soggy crepe, with banana, nutella and no chocolae syrup. Booo. What a disappointment, especially for 7 bucks. I asked where the whip was and they said that was extra, ummmmm okay. So i asked if they could add it quickly and i would pay. 

The kicker, I would have to go to the end of the line and pay. There was no way i was going to wait behind 3 people for whip for 75 cents. never again."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the mall! I stop here every time I go shopping. The owner is very nice and friendly. But the best part are the CREPES! My favorite is the strawberry Nutella but they are all good. Never heard of salty crepes with chicken and stuff but I've tried a couple different salty ones and they are really yummy using the crepes instead of bread for a sandwich. Dessert ones are still my fav. Portions are really big too so they are shareable."}
{"text":"2 stars for the crepe. 2 for the service. Even though she was nice to me, she was really irritated by the gentlemen behind me trying to figure out what he wants. She would speak to the wall while answering his questions. Crepe was okay. Got the strawberry, chocolate, whipped cream crepe & it was over powered by a huge amount of whip. Not that satisfying & definitely not worth the $8 paid"}
{"text":"The goods:  Never had a crepe that wasn't for breakfast.  Delicious.  Strawberries, chocolate syrup, ice cream and whipped cream.  It was my little slice of heaven for the day."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki chicken crepe and my sister got the banana cream crepe. She said hers was really great. Mine had a weird sauce with lettuce that was reminiscent of ranch-caesar dressing. It had grilled chicken with a sweet teriyaki sauce but unfortunately, the lettuce and chicken were separate. The actual crepe was perfect and crisp, yet soft. The crepe was huge though!"}
{"text":"For a mall food court option I have to say Crazy Crepes is pretty good. I like them. I mean they must be doing something right to keep a business going in a place that must have exorbitant rent.

I like my crepes with ice cream, Nutella, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. It's very sweet. It's supposed to be very sweet. I think I may have been here over a half dozen times in the last year. I usually get the same thing. I think my bf has tried ever other sweet concoction they have on the menu. Every one of them was a hit but I think he liked the Nutella and bananas the most.

As for the service, I really couldn't say. It's food court restaurant in a mall. The cashier takes my order and my crepe gets delivered. Their attitude may not be the \"most bubbly smiley\" service ever but I don't think I've ever experienced any rudeness."}
{"text":"Located at the Fashion Show Mall, 3rd floor, food court. If you are staying at the strip & craving crepes this is the place to go! I've gone to a crepe place at the Venetian & it sucks! Here at crazy crepes, I ordered the Nutella, banana & strawberry crepe & they put more than enough. Definitely my go to spot at the strip"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the banana strawberry crepe with cookies and cream ice cream super good and huge! :) their menu selection is good and Is great for a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Owned by a nice and friendly korean lady, Crazy Crepes spits out some good tender and fluffy crepes.  The boo and i got the banana creme pie crepe, which came with whipped cream, bananas, caramel sauce and a scoop of cookies and cream ice cream.  The combination worked extremely well.  I didn't expect a food court shop to make good crepes but i was surprised.  I will definately go back to Crazy Crepes located in the Fashion Show Mall when i return to sin city."}
{"text":"I went here because I haven't had a crepe in a while and I had a craving for it. I gave it 3 stars because the crepe I got was not as crispy as I would like it. Instead, it was kind of soggy, but it was still edible. They have all kinds of choices, but if you order something not on the menu, they charge extra. For instance, I ordered a strawberry nutella crepe, but they charged my an extra dollar since that wasn't a menu choice and so the strawberries was considered an add-on. The funny part was they had a similar item called strawberry and chocolate cream, but I wanted nutella haha. Anyways, a good place to go to for a snack that will fill you up."}
{"text":"Went to buy a drink here, but they girl working the cash register with long dark brown hair was really rude to my friend and I when we asked questions about the menu. She didn't even recommend any drinks to try, or greet us. I work in the mall as well so I could understand how it feels to have a long day of work, but she should still have a positive attitude with customers."}
{"text":"Got a Gam & Cheese crepe and Italian Chicken and it was amazing!! Also picked up a Thai Tea Bubble Tea - yummm"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever trying a crepe. I had got the strawberry banana one and it was bomb. The whip cream was a little too much and over barring but aside from that i really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Nice, large, soft crepes. I got the strawberry, whipped cream and cheesecake crepe.  They put the cheesecake in the microwave to heat it up but it was still cold and hard when I ate it. To be honest, there was too much cheesecake but the crepe itself was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I ordered the caramel banana crepe. It was delish after I scooped out a good amount of whipped cream. I'm wondering if I would have paid less if I asked for less way less whipped cream.."}
{"text":"The woman who runs the place is nice and the blueberry cheesecake crepe was huge and pretty tasty (crepe, blueberry spread, and a slice of cheesecake!). Luckily I shared this with my wife else I would have felt sick afterwards given the size of it. Their prices are reasonable too. While I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here I could see coming back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"No more military discount:(  

But came for regular #8 crepe with whip cream, ice cream, strawberries and chocolate drizzle!  Yum yum went my tum-tum. 

Located in Fashion Mall at the food court.  Take the elevator from any floor up to level three.  Chairs in food court look like old wooden chairs, time for a face-lift!

Service was great!  Crepes are fresh, fluffy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Savory crepe selection was tiny and my smoothie ended up being a slushie. Better crepes elsewhere."}
{"text":"Their crepes are FAT!!! lol!! 

I'm use to crepes where you can actually hold it and eat it but theirs are not. It did satisfy the crepe craving we were having before I show though. 

The workers were real nice."}
{"text":"Located near the bathroom (sort of middle), in the Upper Level/ Food Court (from the elevator, this is the 3rd floor). 

We've had items from this place before, but yesterday, we had a hankering for a Boba Tea so we got one from here. Disappointing, however, because it was really watered down---too much ice was used. When my husband brought it to their attention, the lady said that it's supposed to be like that, and was pretty nonchalant about it.

Later, remembered we could've went to Godiva to get a truffleatta instead. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about the other reviews. When I went here I had gotten a chocolate, strawberry, whipped cream crepe. It was so delicious. The perfect treat after a long day of shopping and walking."}
{"text":"Great crepe. I had a strawberry, custard, and nutella filled crepe. It was delicious. Tasty! Yummy! Hit the spot. Great customer service. Fast service. I also had the pleasure to watch her prepare another customer crepe. . .It appeared to be a apple and ice cream filled crepe. It was large! The lady was very meticulous in how she prepare the food and her presentation of the final product. I recommend. Try'em out."}
{"text":"Oh man this hit the spot on a hot day in Vegas.

I had the Banana, Whipped Cream and Ice Cream Crepe.  It had a tiny bit of chocolate syrup and I asked for a few almonds.

Pure heaven.

I just wish they had more options to put in the crepes."}
{"text":"This place seems to have left the reviewers unsatisfied! Seriously, they mob up expecting a gourmet crepe as if they copped it from a cute creperie in paris about to watch the sunset on a romantic cruise down the seine river...

It's a food court stop...at a mall... in the middle of the desert. 

These things are loaded w/ice cream, strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, sprinkled w/ power sugar n drizzled with chocolate. A sweet dessert infused with calories. It's ok, you've already lost the weight battle back at the bar, the buffet, room service... w/ that overpriced box of stale cookies at the mini bar that everyone warned you not to touch because the room will charge you...*whispers* It has sensors.

I finished the whole thing with no regards to the many nights spent at the gym trying to get a bombacious bikini body.

Your Homegirl,
Violy"}
{"text":"I love crepes but this doesn't taste naturally I think just something wrong with dough. Some of combinations that they have are disgusting because I never thought that you can put salad in hot crepe. Boba tea that I took there was horrible. Half of bobas was frozen and in ice. Never again!"}
{"text":"Huge and delicious crepes. This is one of the places were they give you what you pay for. I ordered the number number which included strawberries and vanilla ice cream ( the classic one) . They also had. Variety from ice cream, light meals , hot crepes , light meal crepes, custard crepes etc chicken and tuna and much more to choose from. Must try"}
{"text":"This store is situated inside the Fashion Show food court. This place has actually been around for quite sometime. While this is a Japanese franchise, the presentation of the crepe is French- style. I ordered just a plain crepe, it smelled yummy. The girl who took our order twirled the crepe perfectly. It has a faint vanilla taste which was wonderful, I only wish it could've been sweeter. Crazy Crepes offer an assortment of crepes done with fresh fruit, custard or just whipped crepe & syrup, and crepes with salad and deli meat inside!"}
{"text":"Having walked the majority of the east side of the Strip, we crossed over to Fashion and decided to take a small break before covering the west side. Enter Crazy Crepes, located in the mall food court. 

We got the strawberry/chocolate/ice and whipped cream crepe, though as we watched it being made, realized the chocolate would not be Nutella, which we should have specified as a desired ingredient because what's a crepe without Nutella?!

The worker who took our order and prepared it was on the phone while we were at the register, and kept casually talking to someone in the back kitchen while making the crepe, slowing down the service. 

Though the strawberries, cream, and syrup were good, the crepe itself was different than your typical crepe with more of a utensil-eating-method thickness rather than an easy bite thickness. And by the time the staff stopped blabbing to each other, the pancake part was already cold. I don't expect to return."}
{"text":"Had my first Crepe over at my hotel, but was told about this place. So I went here and was stumped after looking at all the different variety of Crepes. I picked the Chocolate Banana Custard Crepe after talking to the nice woman there. I was very pleased. Great prices, great service and very tasty."}
{"text":"Having arrived much too early for Fashion Show, we decided to grab breakfast at the food court.  Not a great selection for the morning, but there was Crazy Crepes, and being big fans of crepes in general we decided to partake.  Pleasant girl behind the counter greeted us and took our order for a Hot (Nutella) Chocolate & Banana and a Chocolate & Almond crepes.  5 minutes is all it takes for us to get the order.

The lifeblood of a crepe is the pancake.  My personal preference are the very light, almost melt-in-your-mouth type with crispy ends.  Here, it's just a tad too thick and chewy.  There is also a hint of the flour taste, which sort of kills it.  Nutella and banana combo is a can't-miss, so despite the imperfect wrap it was decently satisfying.  The chocolate & almond was okay, they give you a lot of almond which is great, but I just don't think these ingredients are quite complete enough to make a full crepe.  It needed that extra ingredient - banana would be perfect - to even out the sheer amount of almonds that overtake your mouth.

So, a decent but not great creperie."}
{"text":"Fuck right I've experienced better!

I was walking the Strip Saturday people watching and taking in the beautiful scenery around me (I was looking at the chicks!) and I had a hankering for crepes.  My mind works in mysterious ways.  

I used my Crackberry to give me a list of a few crepe places on the Strip and up jumps Crazy Crepes.

Me being the person who hates the consumeristic shit that Vegas throws upon us, I skipped all of the high end clothiers and other assorted bullshit in the Fashion Square Mall and decided to quench my crepe thirst here.  

They ingeniously placed pictures and pertinent signage of nearly every crepe on the menu.  That gives the visual person like me a chance to take a look at what the fuck I am eating before ordering.  For others it isn't necessary, but for me this is compulsory.  After I ordered, I realized that they had a full menu of all kinds of crepes including ice cream.

I decided to order the Blueberries and Cream crepe.  Vanilla ice cream and whipped cream accompanied this piece of shit.  

Vegas is known for finding inventive ways to siphon money out of the tourist's pocket when they arrive and this is one more way to do it.....if one doesn't shop, gamble, or take advantage of the numerous ways to obtain sex in the 702, then dine at places such as these.  

At least the eye candy was impressive."}
{"text":"This place was sooo cute, I just had to stop by. Never had a crepe like this before. My cousin and I split one. I got the strawberry cheesecake crepe! AMAZING!!!!! Want to go back!!! Wish there was one near me! Very great service, beautiful presentation, and delicious crepes!"}
