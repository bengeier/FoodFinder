{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions.. Sandwiches are never fresh..  For the price thats the least i should expect... Empanadas arent bad but you cant compare to toronto restaurants. On one occasion the lady \"forgot\" to give me change.. (Seemed intentional) and i felt awkward asking for it. Probably my own fault, but still she definitely knew. Their service is so-so. Hit and miss.. Would reccomend a trip to the newly opened uruguayan shop at kennedy and clarence, brampton. La gran uruguaya.Their quality is unreal. And the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"I don't understand these reviews!  I've been shopping at La Favorita for years and they have always treated me amazingly well. They answer my questions and offer recommendations.   I always find what I'm looking for and the Aji salsa is fresh made and absolutely wonderful!  The cake made with parmesan is great also!"}
{"text":"Very poorly stocked and expensive.... this is the only store that sells latin products in Brampton so we`re stuck with .... wanted to give some biz to the local store instead of the monstromarts but I just can`t.. this store is depressing...they need to ratchet up their efforts to provide more product and at better prices..."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place got a one star previous review because it is very awesome!  My boyfriend and I were walking in downtown Brampton and happened to stumble upon this place by seeing a faded paper photo of an empanada in the window; we were lured inside. Just wanting a tiny snack, we ordered two different kinds of the empanada, served a side of aji. My mind was blown, the empanadas were tender, hot, and flavourful. Aji is now my very favourite salsa/condiment; a little spicy with green onion and lemon. We ended up trying every single kind of empanada the market had ready that afternoon, all were awesome. I especially loved the cheese variation, which had a nice chunk of melty goodness inside. To end the meal, we had a fresh dulche de leche churro, which was just heavenly; crisp, covered in sugar with a pleasingly sweet filling - YUM!! Also, we picked up a huge jar of the aji from the great food section to take home for just $7.00 - it tastes so good! I have to mention also everything here seemed priced so well, in my opinion. I left stuffed, with food to take home, and a smile on my face, all for under $20 for two people. YAY LA FAVORITA!!"}
{"text":"La Favorita is probably the only Hispanic Grocer in the area. They know this and do carry a lot of products, a variety of ready to eat and packaged products to make at home.   This place would be perfect if the staff would be more professional, not rude and arrogant like they have been to me and my wife in several occasions that I have been there.  My recommendation is that if you don't care for rude poor customer service, avoid them..."}
{"text":"I've only been there once so far & I found EXACTLY what I was looking for! can't complain! 5 mins away from home & access to amazing latin products. The only reason why I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because I haven't tried their hot menu yet...& one of the ladies working there didn't give me the time of the day for 1 second...& she was the first one I saw in there, she was unbothered that I was in a rush & just kept doing her thing. Another lady had to step in because otherwise I was asking questions to the back of that other lady's head...rude!!!  0_o"}
{"text":"If La Favorita is located in Toronto Latin American Neighbourhood, it would not be in business for long. But in Brampton, it is a good choice if you need some Latin American grocery, treats or condiments.  Dropping by on an early evening, 2 hour before closing time looking for some snacks. We ended up picking up some empanadas ($1.95 each) and a can of Materva: a Yerbe Mate Soda.  Empanadas tasted salty and with not much of other flavours. Meh...  I cannot comment on the prices on the other products.  The staff though was kind of rushing us kept asking what we want...  We just want to look around and see what we want?!"}
{"text":"I don't even think this place deserves one full star.  The two ladies that run the store have absolutely no manners.  My daughter who has also shopped there says they were rude to her too. I refuse to spend another penny there.  I will get my Latin American products elsewhere.    The store needs to be cleaned so badly."}
