{"text":"Awesome place to eat authentic chinese food!
People are nice and friendly. I definitely recommend this place and will go back."}
{"text":"Payed $17 for 7 Skewers  BBQ Squid & BBQ Fishball. I couldn't  finish a single skewer of either or very chewy, too much cumin or seasonings, my stomach did not hold it down ... My need to try something new was a fail...."}
{"text":"I'm from Ohio. My friend told me that this is a good restaurant. Then, I decided to go to Arizona and go to this restaurant! I want to say that is the best restaurants I have been to! All food I ordered were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"It was delicious!!!! Second time back here and the food has always been authentic! I always get noodles along with skewers!! Satisfied, and reminded me of my hometown in china!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic Chinese food places I have been to. Loved their street style barbecue and spicy noodles (ma la tang). I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a taste of true Chinese food. Also, try their frozen coconut jello. It's absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This was such a surprise. Rarely have I had such awesome flavor. We had grilled calamari, lamb and spicy pork soup. This is my favorite Chinese place now."}
{"text":"They treat customers as garbage!!!! They don't take any responsibilities at all!! 

All their chefs are temporarily trained! It directly leads to the extremely unstable food issues. I had been ordered food from them twice, and the soup was very salty. When they found food quality issues, they did nothing but to post \"Sorry\" on Wechat. Once, they posted \"sorry about today's food\" again, I couldn't help myself to reply to the post. Then they replied to me rudely that they couldn't find any past orders from me so that they believed that I am a indiscriminate person! How could they possibly not find the history orders if they really managed history orders well?! They did send one message to me privately right after they replied to me on the post, they asked when I ordered, however, before I could have replied to them, they added me to the BLACK LIST!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times and it's really good for late night snacks/ small snack place. Their noodles are really good and the servers are pretty flexible with being able to abide by the customer's requests. 

This is a really Asian place so they order differently from usual restaurants, so don't expect like a normal restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good spicy noodles. They always run out by the time I get there though :( and ordering is confusing since the menu isn't in English. They do have pictures, but it's hard to see. I usually just pick something random and it works out."}
{"text":"I found the spot after a late night hunger run. Great spot if you're looking for some type of Asian dish. Not a huge selection of dishes but enough to find something to satisfy you're craving.  Don't try the wings.. nothing like the picture and tasted like fish."}
{"text":"Long hot barbecue, good taste, delicious and delicious Chinese food barbecue 

The best barbecue in arizona"}
{"text":"Kun M., you obviously have me confused with another potential customer whom you disappointed. You and I did not speak on the phone. Rather, you responded to me in a private message about what happened with your staff, and I understood the problem. By posting publicly, I feel the need to update my review. Today, I am giving you TWO stars to commend you for your responsiveness to Yelp reviews, but not for food or service, which I have yet to experience. I very much look forward to being able to write another update when you reopen! Best of luck in getting it going again. I've heard great things and hope to find out for myself soon!"}
{"text":"Such a unique find!! Dragon flame is a food truck that's found a permanent space inside/ next to a convenience store. There's a communal table with chairs inside, but I think it's really designed to be more of a take-out or delivery spot. 

What really made this place great tho, was the owner -he's very kind and friendly, and was so helpful! I didn't know where to even begin with the menu, but based upon his suggestions I tried the lamb stew.. it was perfect for the cold winter weather!! 

Note: If you have the WeChat app, there are even more options, but the ones listed on their menu are their most popular dishes"}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing and possibly the most authentic Chinese food in AZ.

Love the atmosphere, btw."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Very authentic.  Unfortunately, this place tends to be disorganized.  Orders get mixed up, and you end up having to wait.  Also, for what you get, it is very expensive.  It basically caters to the rich Chinese students.  

But, the Chuanr (Chinese kabobs) is the best I've seen in the valley.  Also, the food is very very tasty.  Just realize you are going to pay a lot for it."}
{"text":"This is place is really awesome! Make me feel back to China, the BBQ lamb is tasty! Good place! Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Looks like it is permanently closed.  I went on 6/6/18 at 12:30, and both the trailer and store look abandoned.  There's nothing left in the trailer, the outside looks really dirty, and nobody was around at all."}
{"text":"We were just here and everything was top notch. none of the bad reviews seems to be true... wth?! It's a food truck.. so i had a hard time looking for this darn truck and i even had to call the number and i still couldn't find it, and the person on the phone said \"ok, wait there\" anyways, we were able to find them before one of them had to search for us. It's located right by the liquor store so i won't miss it next time. Until we were sat i was still skeptical because this restaurant is nothing like any dining i've ever been to. Once we got the food, my suspicion melted away. We ordered pork pita, fishball skewers, lamb skewers, dragon flame noodles and the hot broth noodles. The portion sizes are great, with reasonable prices. We got to talk with him for a little bit and he speaks great english and knows his food. We will be coming here very often."}
{"text":"Decent food and nice service! We got two packs of snacks for free?Lamb soup is really really good."}
{"text":"Food tastes good! But service OMG! Soooo slow! We went there, waited 20 mins then the person who came after us got the food. We went to ask, the guy said they forgot to place our order. Then we waited for another 20 mins for just an order of egg and tomato noodle. Noodle was hot, egg and tomatoes were cold. Will never go there again. 

The owner was very nice and trying to help. Guess I will raise my star for his effort to try to improve their service. I was given ice-cream bar due to the slow service, but The ice-cream was all smashed. Not eatable to me. But I appreciate the owner trying to help. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I made an account just to review this place! Dragon Flame has some of the best food in Tempe, hands down. Order the cumin lamb noodle or the BBQ eggplant. \"Sensational\" would be an understatement."}
{"text":"Expensive food, the menu is on an iPhone someone hands you and the wait was really long.  Not sure if I came at a bad time or not, but I wasn't impressed and did not receive nearly the amount of food I was charged for"}
{"text":"The best and most authentic Chinese food I had in Phoenix so far! After eating real Chinese food in multiple cities in China, it's hard to find Chinese food here in Phoenix that is even remotely as good, so I was really excited to find Chinese gem!"}
{"text":"Beijing street food!!! I had a cold beef roll today and the pancake it's in is bomb. This is inside a convenience store just like the hood Chinese food place. I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is extraordinary perfect there. I have no idea why this merchant receive one star at THIS POINT. Cuz it's closed during the summer from LAST MONTH. So people who gave the one star since recently are absolutely fake maybe for some money purpose."}
{"text":"Read the Phoenix Magazine article in June issue. Got a friend to join me based on the positive article. Found a closed convvenience store with a truck parked outside. 
No one was there. No signage. The time was Friday 11:45 AM.  
Website states hours 11AM to -2:00AM.r invr invlved in any way.
We did not see any menu. hours of Operation/ Nothing indicated food was ever involved in any way. Wjat a bust"}
{"text":"Lamb skewers are great, just how I remember them in China. The eggplant was strange and I won't try again."}
{"text":"I came across this place on Yelp. Being a food truck, I was expecting some bold and spicy flavors and it's safe to say I wasn't disappointed at all. The food was great! I ordered BBQ roll, lamb skewer and chicken wings. Everything was full of flavor and tasted great, especially the chicken wings. As mentioned by previous comments, the service was great and the owner took good care of us. I might even go ahead and say it's the best chinese food in the area. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Weird experience at lunch. Basically I got handed an iPhone for their \"menu\". None of the Items I came in for were available (nothing with noodles, bbq or soup). I finally decided on the beef \"salad\" (which had no salad in it, all beef with some spices). The girl reached back on the table and grabbed a pre-made plastic container with room temperature beef. I said no thanks and left. Guess it's better to come when they actually have what is on the menu. Sorry, too Asian hip for me. I'm not trusting all of the 5 star ratings either."}
{"text":"Pretty decent, but very expensive for low quality food. The noodles were not cooked well and some were hard and inedible! I"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town! So flavorful. The lamb skewers and their lamb noodles is a must a try. Will definitely order again. Delivery was super fast."}
{"text":"I really like this place, with open air and nice workers. However, the price can be a little hafty, which is kind of weird since it is a food truck. However, definitely was an experience!"}
