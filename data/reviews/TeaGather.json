{"text":"Nice tiny cafe to chill, free wifi provided. I love their peach & coconut bubble tea."}
{"text":"This is a good deal buy one get one free for any drinks. And I like the fresh fruit smoothies there. Last time I ordered mango one, it was fresh tasty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Gather's bubble tea opening special which was 2 for 1 bubble tea last weekend. I got the roasted oolong milk bubble tea and the taro milk bubble tea both in a large. They were able to customize the ice and sugar which is standard at most bubble tea places. They were cash only at the time but I suspect they will get a card machine soon. The space is nice but there isn't alot of seating. I think the pricing is quite competitive and I was able to get a large for less than $5 which is pretty good in the neighbourhood. There is quite a lot of competition in the area from Cup o House and Real Fruit Bubble tea but I think they are a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their bubble tea. I had a Taro Milk Tea. This isn't \"life-changing I have to go back and get it bubble tea\", but it's pretty standard. They have the basic bubble teas you would want. There's a small sitting area inside but it's definitely more of a grab and go place. I did appreciate that there wasn't any ice in my bubble tea."}
{"text":"BubbleTea is bubble tea... the thing that makes this place special is the staff. They're great at making you feel right at home.

Every Wednesday before dance class, you'll catch me slurpping on one of their fresh fruit smoothies!"}
{"text":"Had their diamond mango slush. I wanted to like this lil mom and pop looking shop in the middle of Korea town, but it was just meh. The slush flavour was fine, but they cut the mango chunks too big. Couldn't drink it through the straw. Where's the fun in that?"}
{"text":"Ordered the avocado smoothie and loved the strong flavor of the avocado and creamy.
For me, it was too sweet, so I would probably ask them to put less sugar/syrup next time if that is an option."}
{"text":"We were walking on Bloor street on a super hot day. 

You know how you watch a show or a movie, and there's character walking aimlessly in the desert looking for something. Seriously, when I saw the sign advertising mango juice with mango pieces for $3.99, I was that guy in the desert who had just found an oasis. 

Place looks pretty simple. Chairs, green walls, stools that make you squat lower than you are, and an ordering table. 

Nothing too spectacular about this place or my drink, but it seems like that have a lot of promos. Be sure to keep a look out for those."}
{"text":"I'm giving them five star for their service because we went their place around 10:40 and the closing is 11 :) the lady is very nice, we didn't here or feel anything from her and there still some customers who came around 10:55 I think...  Customer service is thumbs up and the serving for the crepe is quite big."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this bubble tea place a try since they advertise fresh fruit smoothies (and our usual real fruit smoothie place was closed). Ordered the mango diamond fresh fruit smoothie with tapioca. Maybe I'm spoiled from other chains, but the smoothie didn't taste fresh; it was warm and very watery. I like a good thick smoothie. The tapioca was a bit hard. Perhaps it was the time of day we came as it was late but I wish everything was fresher. Probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Best avocado smoothies in Toronto, I base it on how much avocado is used and how it isn't stupidity sugary or full of crushed ice. Highly recommend, i get the XL atleast 2 times a week"}
