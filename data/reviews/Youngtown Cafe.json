{"text":"When lost in the desert and hungry beggars cannot be choosers. Well, I found Youngtown Cafe. I felt like I was transported back to the 50's ( couldn't tell anyone what the 50's are like). I walked in and was starved. I was created with a large smile and how are you. 

Sat down and looked over the menu, the prices we from another the and the menu was very NYC diner. I ordered the French Dip and it was really good for $5.75.

Total bill for lunch was $10 with a $3+ tip.  

Once agin, I would like to give a 3.5 star rating, but cannot. Over time i have really grown to understand the 4 andy 5 star and what they mean.  Food and service were great, but based on the rating scale 3.5 is where they should be."}
{"text":"This place has great breakfast!! Family of 4 can eat here very affordably and it has a nice and friendly staff.

They even stayed open past closing time because we showed up and were hungry :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food great service. The staff is friendly and nice. The food is excellent and fresh made from scratch. They serve American and Mexican food. Been there many times. The apple pancake is to die for."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't say this........ But, Wow! Great food, great service. the reason I shouldn't say this is it might get so crowded I'll have to wait in line. Just sayin'!
Really, really, really GOOD!"}
{"text":"The almond fish was some of the best...ever! The mashed potatoes, yes, mashed potatoes, were great. It was obvious by the friendly attitude of the staff that it was family...and they cared about their quality of food and service.

Not bad for just stopping in to try it!"}
{"text":"Very good food!!! Omg The Apple Pancake is to die for!!! Very good prices. Look the staff. First time here but definitely will come back. Nice restaurant very clean an pretty."}
{"text":"Great food & friendly service. Very clean restaurant. The chocolate chip pancakes are amazing. This was my first visit, I will be back."}
{"text":"We have been there several times for breakfast and once for dinner since it opened a few months ago.  It has always been almost empty since it was a new business, but the service was good and the limited menu produced excellent food.  The owner and waitresses were all very friendly, and we would not hesitate to eat there again.  The one evening meal we ate was on a Friday and they only had about 4 choices available for diners, including a fish fry and a pasta dish.  They are hampered a bit by the seedy strip mall they are located in, and the lack of consumer traffic in the plaza, but they are trying hard to be successful and we try to patronize them in the summer when our usual places are often closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"So good! Don't let the run down strip mall and the fact that this place is empty scare you away! So delicious! We had the chorizo omelette and the banana pancakes. The pancakes were unreal good and the omelette was so fluffy and they use good quality chorizo. Our waitress kept the coffee coming and even brought us a sample Alice of the apple pancake. Be warned it takes 45-60 minutes for the apple pancake we were too hungry to wait but you can call ahead and order it our waitress told us."}
{"text":"The crowd today was awesome.  Everyone loved the food.  I cant post a picture because I don't know if the people would want their picture posted, but believe me, there was an awesome crowd.  Way to go Youngtown Caf√©!!!"}
{"text":"Traditional food & minimalistic decor. 

I had some good praline pancakes (if it wasn't praline, it was something similar) & eves dropped on some scandalous conversations, lol. 

The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Cute little place and our waitress was great. Prices are very reasonable, thankfully so because my date forgot his wallet so I picked up the tab. Hahahaha!"}
