{"text":"First time to Toronto for a business trip looking for a great restaurant and experience... Found both at Boil King! Awesome staff, specials, flavor and energy. Can't wait until the next trip here! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We had the snow crab. It was very good. The sauce and seasoning is fantastic! Service was good, too."}
{"text":"The sauce could be the best in Toronto compared with other \"Boil\" restaurants. Also, the service is pretty good. It's really worth to try :) And I am really look forward the grand opening."}
{"text":"Super seafood!  Great flavor sauces. Reasonably priced.  Kind and attentive staff. Comfortable atmosphere.  I've been here twice in less than a month! And will come back many more times!!!!!  Huge mussels and awesome oysters!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for their buck a shuck. Oysters were super fresh! Their BK sauce is very different from other places and is very enjoyable. The seafood was super fresh, which is different from the other \"boil\" restaurants. Our server was very kind and polite too. Decor was amazing, very unique with a modern trendy feel. Would definitely recommend people to give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Flavours for the sauce were good; both garlic butter and Boil King sauce are distinct but great. Cajun fried rice was extremely underwhelming given that there was nothing \"cajun\" about it - squid was not seasoned at all. Overall a very unique concept in the Entertainment District, but the price point is on the higher end. Would be 4 stars if they adjusted pricing a bit relative to the amount of food. Definitely worth a try though, just not 100% sure about coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first seafood boil experience and it was great. The shrimp boil was excellent and the shrimp were large and fresh. The sauce was pretty spicy and I think I would consider medium next time. The Cajun seafood fried rice was flavorful, a good portion and had a good amount of seafood. The service was really attentive and friendly. The prices seemed pretty reasonable for the quality and amount of food. Great experience for a low key, tasty meal. Gets a little messy but when we asked for wet wipes at the end, they brought us a warm water bowl with lemon. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Newly opened seafood boil bar on King and Peter that's doing it right!  I was lucky enough to be invited to a tasting and loved every moment of it. We tried the shrimp, clams, mussels, snow crab, oysters, wings and rice. I especially enjoyed the shrimp because it was super fresh, meaty and absorbed the sauces very well. The mussels from the fried rice was different from the ones in the bag - the rice ones were a lot meatier and fresher. I really liked their sauce because there was a hint of curry which gave it a nice taste.  Everything was a little on the salty side but extremely flavourful and not over powering with garlic!  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Large and spacious. Lots of decor.  Good service. Wait-staff even went to find chopsticks when I asked for a pair.  We came for the lunch menu. Cajun seafood fried rice and the seafood combo, for the bag experience.  Presumably the proper way to eat at this location is to use disposable plastic gloves and dig in with your hands. Using gloves was amusing for awhile, but I ended up just reaching in with chopsticks anyways.  Food was ok. Seafood fried rice had flavor, and some pieces of seafood. Enough to fill a large plate, so was ok.  There wasn't that much in the seafood bag: a potato, a couple mussels, a couple jumbo shrimp, some oysters, a clam, and a piece of corn-on-the-cob. Would not be enough for a meal IMO. Feels more like a seafood sampler. There was also a bowl of coconut rice, but it was pretty much plain rice. Couldn't really taste the coconut very much.  This review is only for the less-expensive lunch items. The expensive dishes may be much better in terms of portion and flavor."}
{"text":"I really liked all of the seafood.  In particular, I especially enjoyed the Snow Crab Legs!  Sometimes it is difficult to open crab to eat because it is definitely messy (you have to use your hands to eat it; there's no other way haha) but I found these snow crabs were done so well that upon cracking open the shell of the leg, the crab meat pulled out so easily and flawlessly.  I was so impressed.  The snow crab legs were done in Medium Cajun sauce.  I fell in love with how juicy it was!  I highly recommend the snow crab!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday with four friends after work, have to say it is the best seafood I've had awhile!!   The waiter was very friendly and helpful, he gave us good recommendation on the portion we should have. For five of us, we ordered the shrimp , bay scallops, crawfish, baby scallops, snow crab leg, chicken wings with fries. The seafood is fresh and was perfectly cooked to completely absorb the sauce inside and out. There are four different flavours to choose and I like the garlic butter the best!! Must have their snow crab leg, it is so fresh and juicy that you can actually taste the sweetness.   Plus, the meal is not messy at all as they not only have a cute bucket to hold all leftover shells for the seafood, the waiter also checked and replaced a new plate once it is filled. All in all, I had great experience here and will be back for sure to try their mussel and lobster!!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun!! Excellent seafood, reminded me of eating lobster on the east coast with bibs and lots of butter!  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Because of staffs attitude when i informed them of how i felt in regards to the crawfish but it improved toward the end."}
{"text":"The value they offer is not enough for the price they charge which is why I'm giving them 2 stars.   We ordered mussels and shrimp for the seafood boil and the seafood fried rice. Compared to other seafood boil joints in the city, they don't have a wide selection of sauces, in fact, there were actually only 3 to choose from. I felt that the House Sauce was not very flavourful despite them mixing the Cajun + Garlic sauce together. It didn't \"sink\" into the seafood and came off very watery.   I liked their Garlic sauce very much. I think this is the best choice out of all 3 sauces! Definitely give it a try if you cannot decide which sauce to go with.  Seafood Fried Rice was horrific. They put so much pepper on it that it was all you can taste. I felt like I was choking on every bite I put in my mouth because the peppery taste came out so strong. The only good thing about it was the portion and they were relatively generous on the amount of seafood given.   Service was really amazing. They were very attentive in filling up our water and kept asking if everything was going well. I think the service is the only thing that saved the experience that night."}
{"text":"I came here twice and both time I really enjoyed the food. I tried the shrimp, muscles, clams and scallops in the bag. Personally preferred the shrimp and muscle more because the flavour infused well with the shrimp and muscle, whereas I thought the seasoning was too much for the scallops.   The key thing We love the most is the curry crab! My whole party loved the crab! The curry crab came with potatoes and nan. Delicious! Would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"The service is good, the environment is good.Everything is good except the taste.  I ordered a pound of baby scallop,a pound of crawfish with Boil king sauce also the shrimp poutine for appetizer.  The scallops are  very big and tasty but I think it's a little bit overpriced . I don't like the crawfish,not very fresh and the taste is weird. Will not go for the revisit ."}
{"text":"Absolutely an awesome experience! We had a group of 6 people and ordered just about everything on the menu (shrimp poutine, wasabi cucumber, chicken wings, fresh oysters, boil shrimp / mussels / scallops / lobster / Alaskan king crab). The seafood was extremely fresh and the Boil King sauce was fantastic (what a perfect pair with the fresh seafood)! The waiter was very attentive and overall, an A++++ dining experience. Highly recommended and definitely will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience..I've been meaning to check out this place since it opened as I work in the area. I came to get a take-out and ordered seafood boil for lunch. Once I brought i it work to eat - I opened the bag and realized that the boil was packaged in a plastic bag!!! Yes...plastic bag..not a soup container but a bag that was just tied...are you kidding me? As I tried to transfer it to a bowl so I could eat it - it spilled all over my light jeans, my white shirt and my white cardigan..this is buttery cajun sauce that stains like crazy..I don't care that this restaurant just opened - but come on..can't you invest in proper take-out containers? Obviously the place is cheap and whoever runs it has no idea how to run a business...when you call the place - no one picks up and it goes to a personal cell phone voicemail..If you don't know how to run a business - please don't because you won't last in downtown Toronto with such service. There was only 1 person serving the entire restaurant at lunch - they didn't even have a host!! I am very frustrated..and the stew that was $14 didn't even taste that great, but now on top of this I basically ruined my clothes and have to spend more $."}
{"text":"My friend and I popped in here after work and had a wonderful experience. The decor is beautiful with trendy and kitschy touches. We ordered the sea scallops, shrimp, lobster, and corn. What a fun and delicious experience! The seafood was great and the sauces were super flavorful. The Boil King sauce was my top pick but my friend preferred the garlic butter. Decent beer selection with some craft options.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive. The whole experience was super fun. We'll be back for sure! We want to try the crab options next time and crawfish when it's in season."}
{"text":"Made reservations last week. Web page said restaurant was closed for a Tiff Event and would re-open Sept 12. Made reservation by email for Sept 12th and called today to re-confirm and was told the restaurant could not honour the reservation. Nobody from Boil  even bothered to email me of this, talk about CRAP SERVICE. If you are planning a special occasion or event don't bother considering this place. Worst service ever. If you can't honour a reservation, please let your customers know in advance :(..."}
