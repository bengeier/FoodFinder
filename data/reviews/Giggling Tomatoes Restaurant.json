{"text":"The food is usually good. I love the hamburgers, the back bacon on a bun is good too. 
The only issue I have is they bring out the food one plate at a time. One time they totally forgot my 3 year olds food all together. We weren't impressed. Service isn't the greatest, but the food usually makes up for it."}
{"text":"I only went here for breakfast, but I like the idea of sit down food without being waited on. It was okay food, great for a saturday morning quick breakfast for a sit down and chat. I love the choices they have for different types of french toast, since it's my favorite food group."}
{"text":"Soooo good. When my boyfriend and I first walked in I was put off by the lack of service but that all changed once we got the food. So unlike regular sit down places, you order the food at the counter then you sit down and they deliver it to you.

I had the eggs Benedict which may be the best eggs Benedict I have ever had in my life. A must try for sure.

*edit: it is the best eggs benny in all of canada!"}
{"text":"While I'm not quite sure what the tomatoes find so funny, hitting up this place has been on my agenda for a year or 2 now. Feels good to finally ketchup.

Located at the corner of Queen and Kennedy, Giggling Tomatoes puts itself in dangerous territory. Not only does it have to compete with the Asian cuisine and Crabby Joes across the street, it also has to lock horns with the popular evening spots like Sonny's, Burrito Boyz, and Taco Bell, though its closing time is oddly early.

At first I thought I'd wandered into Jurassic Park. The ceiling and walls are decorated with forest designs, faux leaves hanging, and the colour of the booth padding matches, which were also very comfy. There is also a plasma TV hanging by the exit, in case you feel that burning desire to watch CP24 while waiting for your food.

The menu was surprisingly extensive. They have an all-day breakfast setup (complete with peameal bacon and a good selection of omelettes), as well as diner goodies like grilled cheese, soup, salad, gyros, and BLT's. They also offer a vast list of lunch/dinner options: Souvlaki, chicken shawarma, wraps, steak, seafood, burgers, and pastas with shrimp/chicken. They also offer beer and wine if you choose to partake. The prices are all extremely reasonable as well. 

Being a half-hour before closing, I'm not sure if they normally have more staff on hand, but they had one very sweet server and one cook while I was there. Being so late, I ended up skipping the big breakfast I was craving, and opted for their Home Style Burger with Onion Rings instead. Pretty risky, considering I could very easily get a trouser-tickling burgasm at Sonny's instead, but seeing as how the price of burger was the same in both locations, I thought I'd steel-cage-match this bitch, and see which burger came out on top. The onion rings were onion rings. I don't think I've ever had an onion ring that was inedible, or didn't taste like all of the others, so it's burger time!

Holy Kennedy and Queen cattlecaust! Burgasm achieved here as well! In terms of cooking time, I had to wait longer for GT's slice of sly steer, but the portion was much thicker than Sonny's. Flavourful, fresh-bunned, and served with a smile. I'm a fan, and have a whopper of a menu to burn through on subsequent visits. 

If the tomatoes' giggles are that of the chest-out 'bring it' persuasion, they have the right."}
{"text":"Whether it be because Ive made great memories here or not, I really enjoy Giggling Tomatoes. Forget Breakfast - They've got amazing Pasta dishes and the portions are quite nice. I wish they'd finally open up a location in Mississauga already. My mom loves it here and to me thats all I need to love it more."}
{"text":"The restaurant opens up bright and early at about 6am if I'm not mistaken!

You go to the cashier to order and they give a colour coded wood block and you put it on your table where it's visible. You grab your utensils and coffee/tea if you ordered, they provide you a mug and you get unlimited refills =O You find a seat you like, then they come find you. It's kind of neat!

I love the spaghetti with rose sauce and their breakfast that comes with eggs, home fries toast and some sort of meat. I can never finish the breakfast myself so I share with my BF! The breakfast is around $5 and its yummmy! Better than MCDs =D

One more favourite is the......... 
Chicken Souvlaki Dinner Combo, you get two sides (I usually choose greek salad and rice) .. oh so goooood!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service, but what really stuck with me was the issue with accessibility for infants. There is a change table in the ladies room, but not the men's room. My husband went for lunch with a friend and had to leave before he was done eating as he couldn't change our daughter. Come on!! It's 2015, men are very involved in child care and the message sent here that it's a woman's job is pathetic. Get with the times!"}
{"text":"This is a good cheap all-day breakfast bacon and eggs place. I think it's something like $5 for the simple bacon, eggs, home fries, and toast and so you can't go wrong. Especially since most other \"all day breakfast\" places in Brampton close at like 3pm.

Unfortunately, it is not much more than a good cheap breakfast place. I don't recommend ordering anything too ambitious. It will all be edible but everything I've ordered (burgers, fish and chips, etc.) have been very meh. Everything is cheap though so even if it's not great you don't feel like you've wasted too much. Their Greek items (soulvaki, for example) are a step above meh. They're like Meh+.

A few annoying pet peeves:
- They used to have jugs of ice water. They now flat out refuse to give you water. Like I asked for water after buying a meal and was told they sell water but do not give out cups of water. I am not even sure if this is legal. Which I brought up to her. She said it was. Regardless, it is water. How do you deny that to your customer? Could you BE any more obtuse?
- The ordering style is odd. You order at the counter and are then served at your table. But you also have to get your own condiments, cutlery, napkins, you name it. Oh and the cutlery is literally from Dollarama. Like it could not be worse quality. How bad can cutlery be that it's even notable you ask? Oh, you'll see.
- The tables at each booth are weirdly narrow. I've never seen anything like it. The booths themselves seem to be always moving so they're never set up in a straight line in any way which causes the whole restaurant to look messy.

I would've rated it 3* for a consistent simple and okay breakfast but I dunno... I prefer to go to places who won't nickle and dime me over a glass of water."}
{"text":"Family run, comfort food, not quick.

There are a few Giggling Tomatoes franchises now, but I think this is the original. Sitting right on the corner of Queen and Kennedy, parking's a bit of a mess, but there's plenty of room inside.

Their menu is overlarge. Breakfast, pasta, fish, burgers - this place tries to be a deli and a diner and a grill and an Italian restaurant at the same time. It results in them being a little overpriced, a little slow, and a little less well-executed than you'd want. You can hardly complain about lack of choice, though!

My advice is to pretend that they are a greasy spoon breakfast/lunch diner and treat the rest of their signage as a printing error. Their sandwiches are good, their omelets are massive but full of fresh veg, and their fries are pretty tasty.

Pro-tip: The portions are massive, and you would do well to take advantage thereof. 3 people can probably get by on 2 breakfast orders, and 4 can certainly make do with 3 lunches.

Parking Pro-tip: the strip mall just east of them on Queen has tons of parking, and is hardly a long walk."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Giggling Tomatoes for YEARS because I dislike breakfast food.  When I realized they had pasta here, I was intrigued. I really do like their pasta. It's about 9-11 dollars, depending on which ones you order. I've tried spicy sausage, penne alla vodka (which I was informed was made with beer, which is cool with me), and rose. I really liked all of them. I also like how laid back the atmosphere here is and there is free wifi!

I think what I liked about this Giggling Tomatoes in particular (I've been to three different locations) was that it served alcohol! Wine and beer! How awesome! 
It closes at 10 pm.
This is a nice place to grab some grub :)."}
{"text":"While the menu offers some decent variety including pasta, I find nothing stands out singularly. It's all okay, but a better version of every item can be had by another nearby restaurant. Going as a group with mixed wants, I guess that would be a win all around then."}
{"text":"Not sure if they understand what a quality breakfast is. Although it may seem to be reasonable priced, don't be fooled. the food is quite poor in quality, how could you go wrong with eggs,  you can serve it with cold, dry toast. Pancakes is something that they have no clue how to prepare, . Coffee is terrible, service at counter not the best. Orange juice is expensive. All in all, not a good value for my money. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"love the breakfast here. Simple dining, no waiting, you order your food at the counter then sit down and they bring it to you. have tried the lunch and dinner menu Its really good food too. Nothing fancy but great food friendly staff."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast one day instead of my usual place. They didn't have the omelette I normally get so I just got the usual bacon, eggs, sausage, ham and they offered me salad instead of getting toast which was great.

Food is good, hard to mess up breakfast food. I'd go here again, friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"We had three people at our table. Two of the orders were cooked wrong and the other came to the table ten minutes later. The service sucks. Place is very dirty. For a place called giggling tomatoes that has low quality non organic tomatoes. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"We go here for weekend breakfast often.  The food is always good.  We have tried other places but so far none have been as good as GT.  Place your order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  The young lady cashier that has been there forever hasn't been there recently and I've noticed that the other people who take orders are not as good or as pleasant as she was."}
{"text":"Gobbling Tomatoes 

. . .they might as well call it that because you'll be gobbling down their delicious food. Personally I love this place: it serves all day breakfast! I love being able to wake up late in the afternoon and still be able to catch breakfast. I'm not the type of person to wake up before 11 or godforbid before 10 in the morning to be able to order breakfast food. Don't tell me when I can and can't eat breakfast! 

I visited this place several days ago for my girlfriend's birthday. I walked in at a quarter to 10pm and ordered breakfast! I got their bacon, eggs and home fries combo. It was just as delicious as I hoped for. The atmosphere of this place is nice and the staff were friendly. They were out of garlic bread when my girl ordered pasta, so they gave us pitas instead which was okay. I love both so it didn't really matter to me. 

I definitely recommend this place! 

PS. The pasta was awesome"}
