{"text":"We had our club meeting here every month when it was City Tavern and usually had 30-40 people a night. I made a special trip there at lunch time to see if we could reserve the front room for our January and February meeting but the manager didn't want to be bothered. Wouldn't even come out and meet with me and sent word via the waitress for me to send them a request via email. Went to Jim-N-Nick's for lunch the next day. They were anxious to have us."}
{"text":"We have given this place a few tries. Nice from the outside, cheap diner from the inside. The hostess was sloppy and disheveled. The waitress was awesome, but the food was barely edible. I would not recommend this establishment at all. Go down to Maxwells about a half mile east."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give them 1 star...can not select 0 stars though.   Breakfast was luke warm at best and the biscuits were HARD.  When alerting the manager we were told \"it can't be since everything is made to order\" - hhhmmm...?  Will not try the dinner menu.    Save your money and choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a better review to this local establishment. I also feel bad for the staff as they have to bear the brunt of the mistakes made by management and food prep staff.  This Friday evening my wife and I sat at the bar. After having to shuffle our seats to get away from the glaringly-bright spotlights, we were promptly greeted by the bartender. Unfortunately, we couldn't make sense of the beer list since they helpfully included the brand of beer, but not the type (hint; just saying 'OMB' or 'Terrapin' does not tell me what beer you actually have).  Unfortunately it got worse. Our spinach dip came out cold (after hearing a similar cold food complaint from the patron down the bar).  After complaining, the bartender took it back, and (as expected at this point) came back over-microwaved and boiled over to the point of having lost most of it.  Thankfully the bartender comped the mess without having to ask.  I was really hoping the custom blended 'angus short rib' burger would redeem. Not a chance, unfortunately. If the menu hadn't called it out as something handmade I wouldn't really care, but to misrepresent the 'US Foods frozen patty special' as something it clearly isn't just makes things worse.    For $10 I shouldn't have expected much, but the expectation had certainly been set incorrectly.   In all, I don't plan on going back unless there are some major changes. It's a shame since I'd love to see more local places to go out to."}
{"text":"Went to 701 Main on St. Patrick's day and it was super empty (probably because there was a block party at the Irish Pub).  However, the ambiance was not good and quiet although it was a Saturday and there was an opportunity to have the basketball and or other sports games on...it was quiet, could hear a pin drop quiet.  No background music (I would have loved elevator music) nothing but me and my thoughts and my husband and I stare at each other and have our children look at our phones for some stimulation besides sitting at a table and ordering Greek Food.  The food by the way was ok, not bad also was not great.  I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Nice to have a new face in this place. The last restaurant lost there way and deserved to close, but these guys have it going on. My wife and I had a delicious lunch with FANTASTIC service. Everyone was very attentive, kind of a team effort going on. My french dip was perfectly cooked, bun toasted to perfection and the fries were hot (as they should be) My wife had the lasagna and loved that just as much. Neither one of us left a bite on our plate, a true sign of deliciousness. The beer selection is spot on and my draft beer was served in a cold mug, another win in my book! What really impressed us was when one of the chefs came out of the kitchen and checked with many guests on their meals.  The attention to detail is what the restaurant business seems to be missing, but we found it at 701. We look forward to our next visit,  Cheers to 701!!"}
{"text":"701 Main won't be here long unless they up their game. Got the Philly Cheese Steak and it was seemed to be microwaved. The bread was rubbery and the meat was super heated. Way overpriced for what you get and the plating was marginal at best. Beer selection.....meh. I had really hoped for a better experience since it's close to home."}
{"text":"Wonderful people, excellent food. Fair pricing, comfortable dining room. Different specials every day, drink specials during the week. Great, knowledgeable and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Well... it's been some months since 701 opened, and we decided to give it a try on Thursday nite.  Pleasantly surprised the best way to put it.  Our server was knowledgeable and responsive.  food was also very good.  BBQ Ribs, full rack for $18 I thought was a bargain and the ribs were terrific.  Two friends had burgers... they also were excellent. tip: seemed really odd to be in such a nice place and get mustard and mayo in those little packets you get a fast food or 7/11.  Just odd. Thursday was Martini nite.. we were tempted and they were excellently made and a nice pour as well. Good Job 701 staff... now just keep it up!"}
{"text":"I have great hopes for this recently opened restaurant.  In our six years living in the area we have experienced four restaurant attempts on this great location.  701 is Greek owned and operated:  a real plus.  Menu has gyros, spanakopita, baklava and Greek salads and daily lunch and dinner specials.  Further, the menu covers salads, appetizers, and Italian dishes like lasagna and assorted pastas.  Good, diverse selections.  The bar is large and well stocked.  Separate from the dining area you could party with friends and enjoy their daily drink specials.  Two connected party rooms have been hosting a number of events.  Most recently an eighty person graduation event.  Our book group has used this party room for luncheons to great success.  You can order off the menu and get individual bills.  Super!  Prices are very reasonable.  And parking is plentiful.  You are out if Waxhaw's congestion.  And it is open every day if the week, even on Mondays when most if Waxhaw is closed!  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had gone here last night for our date night .     It was great  or service was great thank you Chris   you nailed it .   The food was perfect we had the serf & turf    Cooked great   everything was very nice     We will be back     That was our first time there also"}
{"text":"I love it!!! So many great choices. Great food, amazing service, and an atmosphere that will make you feel at home. The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for! Do your self a favor and grab a drink at the bar too- I loved my Moscow mule!"}
{"text":"Food came out fast but potatoes were in scoop like a lunch line. They were supposed to be parmesan but no taste of that and they were barely warm. Broccoli also was barely warm.   Overpriced for what was served. Felt food was prepared and just warmed. Steak was over done."}
{"text":"Though I would try their biscuits and sausage gravy for breakfast and was totally disappointed. They only serve it on weekends so I thought it would be something special. Well, the gravy was cold, it was tasteless and had very little sausage in it.  Joe G"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere. All of our food was great, service was pretty quick and prices were fair- we were very pleased and will come back."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to come here because our past experiences with other restaurants in this location have been horrible. BUT this is so enjoyable. We came on Monday for lunch and I ordered the hamburger. It was on special for $7.00 and that was a steal. It puts Ted's Montana Grill's $15 burgers to shame!! My husband got the gyro plate and that was incredibly flavorful. The salad that came with his meal was fresh - the olives and feta cheese were over the top delicious. Our waitress was friendly and efficient and keep our glasses full. Thank you for a wonderful dinning experience.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! I had a HUGE serving of lasagna with garlic bread and a Caesar salad for under $10... I even took half home with me and got another lunch out of it. Quick service and a friendly waitress. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? To get to our table the girl walked us all the way around the restaurant but the table was right in front of us. No biggie, but an omen I think.  Our drinks arrived with no problem, but in the middle of taking our order she stopped to talk to the people at the next table about their drinks. My husband's burger arrived with completely wrong toppings. My meal arrived without my salad.  When they brought my husband's beer we had to ask for my salad. When they brought the salad we pointed out that they brought the wrong beer. The salad. Ugh. Almost all of the lettuce was yellow and from the center of the lettuce. I ate the croutons and what green lettuce I could pick out. Otherwise the good was just ok. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"It truly breaks my heart to give a bad review to a local restaurant, but I know that others rely on Yelp reviews just as much as I do for a source of truth. My husband and I went in 2 Saturdays ago at 8:45am. There was exactly one other person in the dining room and as we stood at the front podium for a solid 5 minutes, there was not a server or restaurant worker to be seen. Just as we were walking away, a server finally made an appearance and asked to hold so she could seat us. She brought us to a booth, handed us menus, and told us that our server would be right over.  Another 5 minutes later (and again, only 1 other person in the ENTIRE restaurant), our server finally arrived. She took our drink and food order and returned with coffee a few minutes later. We unwrapped our utensils to find only a fork and a knife. We sat, once again, waiting to flag down a server and after several minutes, I gave up and stirred my coffee with my knife. Our server arrived back to the table with our food. She was in some sort of a rush because she dropped off our plates and practically ran off.   My husband and I both ordered the breakfast special (2 eggs, 1 meat, home fries, toast).  The toast came un-buttered and hardly warm and the butter in the dish was cold out of the fridge. The eggs were supposed to be over medium, but were more like a flipped version of over easy. The potatoes were COLD. Not just heated and sat out cold....more like from the fridge and tossed lightly on a griddle cold. Some of the pieces were warm on the outside, but they were stone cold inside. They also tasted old. My husband had the same issue with his and he never sends food back, but had to because they were legit inedible! The server returned with a fresh batch of potatoes and apologized for us \"not getting fresh potatoes the first time\".  Really?!    The only 2 redeemable qualities were the sausage links (hot and delicious) and the coffee. This is a heartbreak for us because my husband adores going out for breakfast and our local options are quite limited. We had high hopes for 701 Main, but they fell completely flat."}
{"text":"We have had take out from here a couple of times in the past two weeks. It was all DELICIOUS! The mozzarella sticks and pasta was all very reminiscent of our local NY pizzeria. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the other apps were great. The wings were a little heavy on the pepper, but otherwise good! We will certainly be regulars here moving forward!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. Came here 5-6 times and food has been great every time. File mignon, fried fish and shrimp, chicken parm, spanakopita, greek salad, all i tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"I ate there last night with seven other people. No one had anything negative to say about their meal choices. Portions are large and cooked properly.  We will return..... They do add the gratuity to the check for any party eight and over even if you ask for separate checks. A big change from the former City Tavern which once was enough for me."}
{"text":"My first impulse is always to try to find something positive to say about a dining experience. The positives here include ambiance and service. The dining area is lovely, and the server was gracious and efficient. The quality of the food, however, did not match either. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and a baked potato. He took a few bites and pushed the salad to the side. The dressing simply was not good and the romaine tasted old. I ordered the shrimp skewer plate which came with sautéed veggies and mashed potatoes, and I asked for cocktail sauce on the side. The flavor of the shrimp was completely obscured by a heavy, greasy buttery sauce. The veggies were over cooked and almost mushy. The potatoes were gummy and bland, and the cocktail sauce had no flavor at all. This was our second visit to this restaurant, and we will be unlikely to return. I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't happen this evening."}
