{"text":"A couple people have said the menu is strange and I'm going to have to agree. I ordered the penne with chicken. It was also equally strange. My chicken was shredded and it sorta looked more like chicken salad then anything. It also did not taste very good.  The service was pretty good. I mean the place was empty so I would hope it would be. We only ate half our meals as the portions were also too big. I attempted to re-heat mine the next day but it was gag worthy for sure. Someone in my household ate it though... but it was not me.  I also thought the prices were wonky. I mean it wasn't offering anything out of the ordinary and after having a really disappointing simple dish I can't say I agree with menu prices. Just BLEH all around... I hope it improves this is prime location!"}
{"text":"My best friend an I went to mcsorleys before going to see \"what to Expect when you're expecting\" we didn't have time to eat anything because it was so packed and busy that I,(being a cook myself) knew the kitchen would be backed up. But we took a look at the menu which seemed promising.  I returned on the Sunday with my boyfriend (also a cook) before going to see The Avengers.  I have a huge love for calamari and was disappointed by theirs. The lemon aoli was bland and bitter and the creole sauce was over seasoned. We ate it anyway and our server could tell we weren't impressed.  I ordered the fish and chips, but got caesar salad instead of chips. Boyfriend ordered the Devils Spice Burger.  My fish was mediocre, it was bland and under seasoned and slightly overcooked. The sauces that came with it were the same as those that came with the calamari. After drenching it in lemon juice, it tasted alright. It also came with Kimchi, which like the review above said, was smelly and inedible. I had to move it off my plate because i couldn't take the smell of it.  We both got sides of caesar salads with our meals and they were watery and really had no taste to the caesar sauce. You could tell that the lettuce wasn't dried properly and was chilled.   His burger was not spicy at all. The menu claims it is super spicy and it did not deliver. The lettuce had chill burn and was wilted and we seemed a little unsure about why he had to put his own mustard on his burger. The meat itself was really dry and tasted burnt. His kimchi was inedible as well  Our poor sever kept coming by and asking if we were ok. The both of us didn't have the heart to tell her that as cooks, we were disappointed. We paid for the meal and left her a decent tip and left.   I'll give McSorleys one more chance once they've become more established and have time to settle into their new home. But if they disappoint again, I doubt i'll ever return."}
{"text":"I've visited McSorley's a couple of times.  Both times the food and service were OK - not the worst, but I've had better.  For an \"Irish\" pub, the menu is more Asian-inspired, and it would be nice to see more traditional pub favourites.  There is a lot of tempura-battered food, wasabi dips, etc. that they could probably do without.  Then the menu takes a detour to Italy and has a variety of pastas and pizzas.  I think they need a more cohesive pub menu, rather than trying to be all things to all people."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the bar tables are up to your neck, and the bar chairs are so low. I could practically lean over and have food in my face without hands.   It's on the outside of Chinook, and very rarely is it busy enough to not get a seat. Good selection of beer, atmosphere is dark and moody to match the decor. Service is mediocre, given Joey's and Chop is within the vicinity. The TVs are placed pretty high. It's tiring to have to look up at that angle to watch an intense game.   Food...was also mediocre. The dinner menu is mall priced (inflated) but the selection is good. Steak was a-ok. The late night menu? Horrendous. It's practically robbery. Raging roll was 4 peices, tempura calamari is the same batter as onion rings and steak bites were jerky quality, tough to swallow. The bill was also tough to swallow.  No thank you!

{"text":"You're in Chinook and your hungry. The food court's closed because it's after 9. Where do you go? Well, a big sign told us that MCSORLEY'S IS NOW OPEN!!! So we go.  Is it a chain? It seems like it would be, but the menu says the chef is from Calgary. Hmmm... Checking the website, there's only one location. So nope, not a chain. I like this trend of local independent spots opening in big malls like Chinook. Keep it up Calgary.  As for McSorley's, it's like a shiny sports bar - restaurant or lounge side, easy to see TVs on the lounge side and high tables. Appys, soups and salads, pizza, pastas, steaks, etc., it's easy enough to find something you'll like on the menu. I opted for the chicken and sausage gumbo and a half size house salad. It was a soup kind of day. They were tasty, I'd order them both again.  Being a Monday eve, it wasn't at all busy, so it was easy to get a table and our server was attentive right up until she brought us our bill. After that, she didn't come back to the table to collect the bill, the onus was on us to get her attention so we could pay.   Anyway, McSorley's fits with Chinook. It's the same polished exterior and \"let's appeal to everyone\" food that you might find at a larger \"trendy-ish\" chain. If it were elsewhere, say 17th Ave, I don't think it'd fly. But for the clientele and the setting, it's about what I'd expect. Bonus points for having a Calgary chef at the helm!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my experience at McSorley's.   My friends and I had been shopping for hours and decided to give McSorley's a try since it had just opened, and we assumed a sports bar would be a good spot for wings and such.  When we got there - 7:30pm on a Saturday evening - it was practically empty. That should've been a sign, but we sat down anyway.   The decor was traditional, but the dark funiture already looked worn. Our waitress was distracted and forgetful - she forgot our orders, and was extremely difficult to get a hold of. The selection of food was also disappointing. Like Aymie R. had mentioned, there were many redundant \"asian-inspired\" food items on the menu. Perhaps they were trying to take a \"fushion\" approach, but it was definitely \"unexpected\" (not in a good way) as it just didnt \"jive\" in a sports bar named McSorleys.  The prices were okay, but for the quality of the food and service, I will not be returning to McSorley's anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like a franchise, but is not. The service was good. The food was ok. Not the best I've tried, but not the worst. I would go back there if I have to, but I would prefer to try another restaurant. The prices are ok too.  The good thing is that this place is Family friendly. It is good for a family group or if you have kids."}
